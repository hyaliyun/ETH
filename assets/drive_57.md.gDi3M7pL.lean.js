Written by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa and directed by Bradley Buecker, it aired on Fox in the United States on March 14, 2013. Plot In New York City, Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) confirms that she is not pregnant, and Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) remains convinced that Brody Weston (Dean Geyer) is hiding something. Unbeknownst to them, he is moonlighting as a gigolo to pay his NYADA tuition. In Lima, New Directions, noticing tension between Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) and Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) (Finn kissed Will's fianc√© in Diva), decides to assign them a week of songs covering musical feuds. Wade \\"Unique\\" Adams (Alex Newell) confronts Ryder Lynn (Blake Jenner) over interfering in the relationship between Marley Rose (Melissa Benoist) and Jake Puckerman (Jacob Artist), and they fight after Ryder refers to Unique as a boy. Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) suggests that they express their feelings through song, and they duet on \\"The Bitch Is Back\\" and \\"Dress You Up\\", but Ryder still struggles to accept Unique as a girl. Meanwhile, Marley reconciles with Jake, but he acts hostile towards Ryder for betraying him by kissing Marley. In NYC, Santana confronts Brody at NYADA, performing \\"Cold Hearted\\" to mock him. Upon learning about this, Rachel and Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) kick Santana out of their apartment. In Lima, Will and Finn duet on \\"Bye Bye Bye\\" and \\"I Want It That Way\\", and although Will forgives Finn, he tells Finn that their relationship can never be the same. Marley later convinces Finn that he is a natural leader and encourages him to get a teacher's degree. Santana eventually discovers Brody's secret and calls Finn, who travels to NYC and confronts Brody in a motel, threatening to tell Rachel the truth if Brody doesn't leave her alone. When Brody attempts to prevent Finn from leaving, they get into a fight, with Finn beating Brody and saying \\"Stay away from my future wife!\\" Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) attempts to force Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss) to rejoin the Cheerios, and after he refuses, she initiates a series of attacks on his personal life.

Sue is elected the winner and welcomes Blaine into the Cheerios, naming him co-captain alongside Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter), unaware that this is part of Blaine and Sam Evans's (Chord Overstreet) plan to prevent Sue from further threatening the glee club once they graduate. Ryder begins chatting online with a girl named Katie Fitzgerald (Ginny Gardner), who convinces him to make amends with his friends. Ryder calls Marley, Jake, and Unique and apologizes to them. They are joined by Kitty Wilde (Becca Tobin), who reminds them that, after the seniors graduate, they'll be taking over glee club. Ryder and Jake lead New Directions in a performance of \\"Closer\\" to celebrate their strengthened bond, and Ryder later messages Katie to thank her.

Oppenheim directed the Masterworks division of Columbia Records from 1950 to 1959. During this time he worked with numerous major figures in the music world including Igor Stravinsky, with whom he formed a friendship, later producing for him. In the 1960s, he worked for the television production company Robert Saudek Associates and worked as a writer and producer for CBS from 1962 to 1967.

He was so impressed with the performance that he contacted his manager at Columbia Records, who then negotiated a contract with Gould. In the 1960s, he worked for the television production company under Robert Saudek, and helped produce Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic. He produced the Omnibus TV series, and worked as a writer and producer for CBS from 1962 until 1967.

It is named after the Italian anatomist Carlo Giacomini (1840‚Äì1898). The Giacomini vein courses the posterior thigh as either a trunk projection, or tributary of the SSV. In one study it was found in over two-thirds of limbs. Another study in India found the vein to be present in 92% of those examined. It is located under the superficial fascia and its insufficiency seemed of little importance in the majority of patients with varicose disease, but the use of ultrasonography has highlighted a new significance of this vein. It can be part of a draining variant of the SSV which continues on to reach the GSV at the proximal third of the thigh instead of draining into the popliteal vein. The direction of its flow is usually anterograde (the physiological direction) but it can be retrograde when this vein acts as a bypass from an insufficient GSV to SSV to call on this last one to collaborate in draining. Many discussions exist about this vein, some of them confusing to a non-expert reader. Insufficiency in the Giacomini vein can present in isolation but is mostly seen together with a GSV insufficiency. It has been shown to be effectively treated either with endovenous laser ablation or by ultrasound guided sclerotherapy.

Female Description Morpho telemachus is a large butterfly. The upperside of the forewings is a silver grey and blue green with a very wide black-brown outer edge. This is also on the posterior wings and can even cover almost all of the hindwings and forewings. There is a black band on half of the costal edge from the base. The underside is copper brown with a line of black white and orange ocelli black white and orange, in an arc on both the hindwings and forewings.

Felder, 1862 Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil (Amazonas, Par√°) *M. t. lilianae Le Moult, 1927 Venezuela *M. t. ssp. Ebert, MS Brazil (Pernambuco) Behaviour In 1913, Hans Fruhstorfer wrote: \\"According to Michael perseus [synonym for telemachus] is never seen fluttering round flowers, nor do the butterflies seem to require food or drink. They prefer rather to soar through the spaces of the illimitable forests like Morpho hecaba or to float along in unrestricted flight over the tops of the trees in a deep valley. According to Hahnel perseus is one of the highest-flying Morphids and on account of its brown under surface, which looks very dark against the light sky, it gives the impression, when flying at a height of 8-10 m, of a black coloured species. Hahnel says that the butterflies, which in spite of their lively, jerky movement through the air scarcely flap the wings appreciably, present a charming spectacle, particularly when half a dozen or more meet and engage in a sham fight. Almost the whole morning such scenes are repeated, for only towards midday, after they have been flying over their wide domain for 2 or 3 hours, do their pinions become weary and they settle again in the shade of the branches on some large leaf, the back turned towards the dark and the eyes towards the open. One rarely finds even a single insect flying in the afternoon and then probably only when unfavourable weather has hindered its doing so in the morning. The butterflies occasionally dart down on to yellow Papilio females drinking on the ground, undoubtedly taking them for their own females which are also frequently yellow, and Dr. Hahnel took advantage of this by fastening pieces of yellow paper in his net, which actually deceived the perseus males.\\"Fruhstorfer, H. 1913.

Plot In 323 BC Babylon, Alexander the Great executes his physician for failing to save his friend Hephaestion using a mysterious draught, and reveals that he has a fever that could well kill him without it. Cotton Malone is preparing to meet with his friend Cassiopeia Vitt in Copenhagen when he finds himself in a burning museum, which Cassiopeia saves him from. She and Henrik Thorvaldsen tell Malone that everything relates to elephant medallions commemorating Alexander's India invasion, and that they're planning a way to discover who is behind the thefts of medallions across Europe, though they suspect Irina Zovastina, who is the Supreme Minister of the Central Asian Federation. Zovastina is planning to conquer all of her neighbors and do the reverse of what Alexander did, through the means of biological weapons. But she doesn't own the cure. Pharmaceutical tycoon Enrico Vincenti, head of the Venetian League, provides it to her. He sees the cure as an opportunity to vastly increase his wealth. Henrik tells Malone that Cassiopeia's dear friend and possible lover was working for Zovastina when she believes Zovastina killed him for what he knew. Stephanie Nelle becomes involved trying to retrieve a medallion for Cassiopeia, but President Danny Daniels and Deputy National Security Adviser Edwin Davis ask her to go after Vincenti. Everyone heads to Venice, where Cassiopeia tries to kill two members of Zovastina's guard, including Viktor Tomas, whose loyalties seem unclear. Zovastina is trying to solve a riddle from Ptolemy to find Alexander's grave and believes the body in St. Mark's Basilica holds the key, negotiating with Monsignor Colin Michener to see it. After a standoff in the basilica, Zovastina takes Cassiopeia captive to guarantee herself safe passage back to Samarkand (her capital), and Michener reveals to Malone and company that he has been acting as a spy for the pope, and Viktor Tomas is an American spy. Vincenti reveals to his chief scientist that the cure for Zovastina's viruses is the cure for AIDS, and kidnaps her lesbian lover, who is dying of AIDS, to be his weapon against her. In Samarkand, Zovastina prepares to execute Cassiopeia, but Malone and Viktor save her, even while Stephanie and Henrik find Cassiopeia's friend, Ely Lund, who is not dead after all. Everyone ends up at Vincenti's Asian estate, where a mountain contains the draught/cure and the entrance to Alexander's tomb. Zovastina kills Vincenti, and thought Viktor is shown to have told her about his spying for America, he gives Cassiopeia the control to blow up Zovastina's helicopter, which she does. A month later, Cassiopeia shows up in Copenhagen to visit Malone, which signals the start of a deeper relationship.The Venetian Betrayal by Steve Berry copyright 2007 ReferencesExternal links * Official Website of Steve Berry * History Matters, the Steve and Elizabeth Berry foundation to preserve historical sites.

Current attendance is approximately 350-400 students for grades 9 through 12. School sports include varsity Baseball, Archery, Cheerleading, Cross Country, Softball, swimming, Volleyball, American football, soccer, basketball, tennis, track and field, golf, and academic team, which competes at Governor's Cup. The school also offers many clubs for students, including National Beta Club, Student Council, National Honor Society, FCA, GSA, FCCLA, FBLA, FEA, and Spanish Club. =History= In the late 1960s, the city of Berea and Berea College worked together to build a new school to replace the city system schools, Berea Elementary and High School, and the college owned schools, Knapp Hall and Berea Foundation School. College-owned property along Walnut Meadow road was chosen as the site for the new school. Construction of the high school (and, concurrently, the elementary school) began in 1969 and was completed in time for the 1969‚Äì1970 school year. =Present day= Berea added a second gym, mainly for the use of the elementary, to complement the current Berea gym, Singleton Gym. A wing of classrooms for middle school was also added, and nicknamed \\"The Pirate Cove\\". Walls were also added to both the elementary, middle school, and high school classrooms. During the same year, a proposal was made to implement random student drug testing. Drug testing began in 2009. In late 2009, the Conkin Gym was completed, as was the other construction. Both basketball teams now play in the Conkin Gym. =Berea Pirate athletics= The 1998 Lady Pirate basketball team finished the year placing third in the state championship competition. The head coach was Greg Todd, who currently is the head basketball coach at Morehead State University in Morehead. On January 19, 2008, the team was reunited, for the first time ever, for their 10th anniversary at the halftime of Berea vs. Madison Central. The cross country and track teams have seen great successes, with individual state champions numerous times throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s. After a long dry spell, the cross country team took the regional runner-up in 2011 and h took the title in 2012. and 2013. In the 2000s, the cross country team has finished as high as 11th at the KHSAA state cross country championships, and finished 16th in 2013.

Madia (born 1947) is an American scientist and laboratory director. Madia holds a Ph.D. in nuclear chemistry, a field in which most of his career was focused at Battelle. In his early twenties, Madia was drafted into the US Army where he trained nuclear reactor operators. He later worked for Battelle, a non-profit research company where he began as a researcher before being promoted to direct various laboratories across the United States and Western Europe. Madia retired in 2007 and joined Stanford University in early 2008. He retired from Stanford in 2019 and is now President of Madia & Associates, Inc. a management consulting firm. Education Madia was born in 1947 in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania and grew up a few miles away in Swissvale. Many of his high school friends went into careers in the steel mills of Pittsburgh but Madia wanted to be the first in his family to attend a university. He was accepted into both Penn State University and Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) in 1965. He paid for his own education by working as a dish washer. He chose IUP because it cost $200 less per year. In his later years at university, he worked summers in a steel mill to pay for tuition. Madia became a member of Sigma Tau Gamma and studied chemistry, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in chemistry in 1969, followed by a master's degree in 1971. After attaining his Master's, Madia went to Texas A&M; University to earn a Ph.D. in nuclear physics but before he had settled in he was drafted into the U.S. Army. Madia trained nuclear reactor operators as part of the Army's nuclear power program in Washington D.C. for the Joint Chiefs of Staff before he returned to study. He attained a Ph.D. in nuclear chemistry at Virginia Tech in twenty seven months, the standing record for fastest Ph.D. at the university. Career In 1975, Madia began work at Battelle in Columbus, Ohio, in their nuclear research department. Madia created the first nuclear fuel cycle analysis group at Battelle. He also developed non-proliferation procedures and managed the plutonium fuel fabrication laboratory, various hot cells and critical assembly facilities. After the Three Mile Island accident he was made a member of Department of Energy's \\"Blue Ribbon Panel\\" to advise on decontamination and decommissioning of the plant. In 1985 he was promoted to laboratory director of the Columbus Laboratories and later became President of Battelle Technology International, managing laboratories in Frankfurt and Geneva. Madia was appointed Director of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in 1994 where he served until 2000. While at PNNL, he oversaw the construction and startup of the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL) and the elevation of the lab to formal national laboratory status. On 1 April 2000, Madia was appointed Director of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and CEO of UT-Battelle, where he served until 2003. Construction of the Spallation Neutron Source and Center for Nanophase Materials, the Department of Energy's first nanoscience laboratory, began under his direction, and he led a laboratory-wide modernization effort. As part of the modernization Madia attracted the investment of private companies to fund buildings to host the National Center for Computational Sciences and the supercomputer Jaguar, beginning a trend of high performance computing that continued for at least a decade. Madia returned to Battelle in 2003 as Executive Vice President for Laboratory Operations where he remained until retirement in 2007, although he continued to involve himself in research and education programs out of interest. In 2008 he joined Stanford University where he was appointed vice president for the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), where he oversaw the laboratory as serves as Chairman of the Board of Overseers. In this capacity, he represented Stanford to the US Department of Energy. He also serves a director of United States Enrichment Corporation, now Centrus Energy (LEU: NYSE) a uranium enrichment company and Atkins Nuclear Holdings. Madia is also an advisor for EnerTech Capital Partners, a green energy, venture capital firm. Personal life Madia met Audrey DeLaquil at a student union dance in his freshman year at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, whom he married shortly after graduation. They have three children; Joe, Ben and Will and four grand children, Augi, Hattie, Isabelle and Enzo.

He first became involved in the 1970s, leading various photovoltaics companies until the turn of the century. As Director-General of the Renewable Energy Association he led the campaign for Feed-in Tariffs and the Renewable Heat Incentive. He has written many publications and is responsible for a number of innovations and initiatives. He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to renewable energy and the energy sector. Sustainable energy policy The campaign for the introduction of the Renewable Heat Incentive and Feed-in tariffs in the United Kingdom was led by Friends of the Earth and the Renewable Energy Association, when Philip Wolfe was Director General, between 2003 and 2009. He edited the first blueprint for these measures to assist early government drafting. He first proposed the Energy hierarchy, and initiated the consumer assurance REAL Code (since renamed Renewable Energy Consumer Code) for microgeneration. Renewable energy industry As general manager of Lucas Industries' solar power subsidiary in the early 1970s, Philip Wolfe negotiated the joint venture with BP to create what became BP Solar and was its first Chief Executive. He was a founding director of the European Photovoltaic Industry Association (EPIA, since renamed Solar Power Europe) and its third President from 1987 to 1989. He was a founding director of the Renewable Energy Association and its Director General from 2002 to 2009. He is an expert on solar parks and has pioneered their introduction in the UK. Following the publication of his book on the subject, he founded the information resource on utility-scale solar power, Wiki-Solar. A series of articles in 2019 explained the differences between individual power plants, solar parks and clusters, and identified the largest in the world at the time. Community Energy His background in utility-scale solar power led to Wolfe's involvement in the community sector when he was appointed as chairman of Westmill Solar Co-operative and led the public offering and acquisition of the world's largest community-owned solar power station. He was subsequently involved in the creation of Community Energy England, to represent the community energy sector in the United Kingdom, and was its first elected chairman in 2014. He was a member of the British government's Shared Ownership Taskforce, and appointed its vice-chair in 2015. Innovation Amongst Philip Wolfe's innovations were the UK's first: grid-connected solar power station at Marchwood, building-integrated renewables at Energy World in Milton Keynes (opened by then Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher), and solar roofing slate.

Moore may have been an uncredited collaborator, or possibly even the author. The novel was first published in the July 1946 issue of Startling Stories, then reprinted in the Winter 1954 issue of Fantastic Story Magazine. Its first book edition was issued by Ace in 1965, followed by a British edition by Mayflower Books in 1966. A French translation appeared in 1972. The novel was reprinted in full in Issue #5 of Amberzine in 1992, and also collected in a 1997 paperback omnibus, The Startling Worlds of Henry Kuttner.ISFDB publication history Roger Zelazny, author of The Chronicles of Amber, credits this book as being one of his primary influences during his youth. Summary The protagonist is airman Edward Bond, who discovers that he shares his body with an alternate version of himself, a despotic wizard named Ganelon. Bond travels through a portal into the fantastical alternate dimension and enters a conflict: the Coven (consisting of a sorceress, a werewolf and an immortal) fight for Ganelon while the white witch Freydis leads a rebellion against him. Trapped between the two sides, Bond/Ganelon battle for supremacy over their shared mind and the fate of a world. Authorship As with so much of the work of Kuttner and his wife and collaborator C.L. Moore, the exact authorship of this novel is unclear. It is generally credited to Kuttner alone; however, most of the couple's work after marriage was done in collaboration, and they frequently worked together so closely as to obscure the extent of their individual contributions. Critic Stefan R. Dziemianowicz has suggested that Bond's split personality in the novel is \\"consistent with CLM's deployment of psychologically conflicted characters in her earlier fiction.\\" Brian Stableford's article on Kuttner in the same encyclopedia also names Moore as a co-author. The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction concludes that it is \\"safe to assume that many titles signed as by Kuttner alone are collaborations, though somewhat less safe to assume that the reverse applies.\\" Allen Varney believed that The Dark World was entirely written by Moore.  Reception Roger Zelazny said that the Kuttner story that had the greatest impression on him when younger was The Dark World and remarked that much of its appeal comes from its \\"colorful, semi-mythic characters and strong action.\\" He cited Kuttner (and C. L. Moore) as major influences on his work, noting that Jane Lindskold identified a number of specific influences from Kuttner and Moore in his own work, particularly the \\"Amber\\" chronicles.issue No. 5 of Amberzine, Phage Press The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction reviewed The Dark World as archetypal science fantasy, which \\"neatly fused Kuttner's vigorous plotting with Moore's romanticism.\\" E. F. Bleiler, describing the novel as \\"Fantastic adventure in the mode of A. Merritt,\\" concluded that it was \\"not one of Kuttner's better works.\\"E. F.

At an altitude of 1690 metres from sea level, it is situated on a gentle slope above the right bank of Nayaar (East) river. It is in the southwestern foothills of Dudhatoli Range and at a distance of 83 kilometers from Pauri town (headquarters of Pauri Garhwal district) and 95 kilometers from Gairsain, the future capital of Uttarakhand. Etymology Originally, the name of the place was Thali (some locals still call it by this name), but since the town is settled on a long and gentle hill (known as ‚ÄúSain‚Äù in Garhwali language) it later came to be known as Thalisain. Just like in Gairsain, ‚ÄúGair‚Äù means a deep place or a valley and ‚ÄúSain‚Äù means a flattish hill. History Garhwal got its name during the 9th century AD when Kanakpal, the chieftain of Chaandpurgarhi, conquered all the little kingdoms from Uttarkashi to Garhwal-Kumaon border and unified them to form the kingdom of Garhwal with Garhwali as the official state language. Garhwal literally translates to ‚ÄúLand of Forts‚Äù. There were 52 of those fortresses scattered all over the land, Chaandpur being one of them. Thalisain was a part of Patti Choprakot in the historic Chaandpur kingdom, with its headquarters at Chaandpurgarhi in Chamoli Garhwal. Chaandpur kingdom administered five Pattis of Garhwal viz Choprakot, Chauthan, Dhaijyuli, Lohbha and Chaandpur (At present the first three are in Pauri District and the next two in Chamoli district, forming a part of Dudhatoli mountains). Ruins of ancient temples of that era can still be found and a few temples are in a very good condition. From these ancient monuments, it can be ascertained that the place has been inhabited since ancient times. Although Thalisain town doesn't have any ancient monuments, but ancient temples can be found scattered around the surrounding hill-tops. Most of these stone temples have been built in traditional Ashlar style, some even showing Katyuri characteristics dating from 12th to 16th century AD. All the temples except Rahu temple in Paithani have been built in remote areas or in wilderness. Besides temples, there are a good number of old houses that can be seen in some villages. These traditional houses, known as Tibaari in Garhwali were quite popular at the time, when Garhwal dynasty was at its peak. Later on, Pauri and Chamoli became a part of British Garhwal and the kingdom of Garhwal shrank in size, almost the entire Uttarakhand was under the British. Thus began a decline of those houses and their construction flourished only in the valley of Bhagirathi, which was the last stronghold of the royal family. Today, those temples and houses tell of the glorious past of the Garhwal kingdom when there were no roads and warriors roamed the forests and bridle paths on their horses. While British administration undertook the construction of several roads, schools and medical facilities in the region, they also formulated policies to take control of the natural resources, specifically the forests, as the region had one of the densest forest covers in Garhwal hills and was conveniently close to the plains of North India. Trees were felled recklessly for timber, fuel and railway sleepers. It was during that era, when railway line was extended from Moradabad to Ramnagar in 1907. Ramnagar became the nearest railhead for the region and facilitated harvesting of forest produce. Geography Thalisain tehsil comprises two blocks, Bironkhal block and Thalisain block. Thalisain development block extends from latitudes 29.54 N to 30.10 N and longitudes 78.54 E to 79.13 E, measuring 35 km in length and 49 km in width. Most of the Himalayan ranges extend from north-west to south-east direction. The south-eastern face is most favorable site for the location of settlements. Because of the sunny aspect, compact settlements are located on the spurs and river terraces. The south- eastern faces are denser than northern and western aspects. North western aspects are not favorable for human habitation and agricultural occupations because it receives less solar energy. Climate The climate is influenced by the altitude and relative position of the land. The overall climate of the region is temperate. The valley area experiences pleasantly warm climate, hence dense population is found in the valleys. Mid slope and mountain ranges have a temperate climate hence semi-compact and scattered settlements are found here. Above 2000m, there are temporary seasonal settlements which are generally distributed on the forest land. Aspects play a significant role in the selection of settlement sites in the Himalayan Mountain. Temperature ranges between 15 and 30 degrees Celsius in summer and -5 to 15 degrees Celsius in winter. The region receives a significant amount of rain in monsoon season as well as snow from December to March. Natural resources * Soil: Thalisain tehsil has a variety of soils depending of the altitude and terrain. As the Nayaar valley broadens in the south, it forms vast beds of fertile alluvial soil which is suitable for rice and other water-intensive crops. As one gains altitude while heading north towards Dudhatoli mountains, the soil gets sandy-loamy with good aeration and drainage. Such soil is suitable for fruits, vegetables and other horticultural produce. North-eastern faces of hills often have humus rich soil as they have stands of dense oak forest. * Forests: There are chiefly 4 types of forests found in the region. # Chir pine forests: The primary species is Pinus roxburghii. Occurring from 1100 to 2200 metres above sea level, these trees grow on drier slopes. However, commercial plantations have come up recently for producing Turpentine, timber-wood and fuel. # Mixed Chir-oak forests: Moist forests at slightly higher altitudes with a predominant mix of Baanj (Quercus leucotrichophora), Chir Pine, Rhododendron (Rhododendron arboretum), Kaafal (Myrica esculenta) trees. These forests exist at an altitudes ranging from 1800 to 2200 metres. # Temperate broadleaf forests: The main species found in these forests are Maple (Acer Ceisium, Acer Acuminatum), Oak (Kharsu, Tilonj and Moru oaks), Hazelnut (Corylus Jacquemontii), Alder (Alnus Nepalensis) and Hornbeam (Carpinus vimeana). These forests are found at an altitude of 2200 to 3100 in shady and cool locations often with moisture. # Alpine Coniferous forests: The dominant species are Silver Fir, Deodar, Cypress, Juniper and Spruce. Sometimes these trees exist in the same habitat but at many locations, there are stands of one species. These forests grow at an altitude of 2200 to 3100 metres. * Water: Nayaar River with its tributaries as well as hundreds of springs and streams forms the major river system in the region. The region has abundant supply of water. Transport NH 121 runs along the Nayaar river, both forming backbone of the region. Several arterial roads lead to remoter parts and serve as lifelines of the region. Still, a lot of high altitude and remote villages have not got roads yet. Some of these villages, specifically in Dodhatoli range, have a good population. Maroda (near the source of Nayaar river) and Daida (below Bindeshwar temple) are noteworthy examples. Demographics As of 2005, Thalisain Block had an area of 584 km2. and a population of 56746 giving it an average population density of 85.46 persons per km2. Sex ratio is 1209 which is considerably higher than the national average of 940 females per 1000 males. Thalisain is pre- dominantly a Hindu majority region, people of other religions have settled here as recently as late 1990s in the last two decades. Hinduism is practised by 99.7% of population, Muslims are 0.2%, and 0.1% didn't state their religion. Total literacy rate is 72.15%, where male literacy rate is at 88.23% and female at 59.09%. Most of the population of this region is confined to valleys and mid slopes of the hill ranges. The area is totally rural with few rural service centers which are developed in urban characteristics. Most of the population is concentrated on the valleys where as fertile agricultural land is available on the terraces. Moderate concentration of population is found on the gentle slope convex spurs (mid slope). Very sparse population with scattered settlements is located on the water divides and ridges. Concentration of most of the population is in the valleys with lowest altitude. As the altitude increases the distribution of population decreases, hence the hill ranges have less population compared to valley. Since the very beginning the settlements were located near the source of water. In the valley areas, dense population is the reason of, abundance of water in the form of perennial springs and rivers. Lack of water resources on the high hill ranges are responsible for scattered settlements with low population density. Culture The upper part of Thalisain and Nayaar Valley has been historically known as ‚ÄúRaath‚Äù and has its own dialect of Garhwali language known as ‚ÄúRaathi‚Äù, a word which is also proudly used as a demonym by locals. The word Raath is said to be originated from Rahu, as there's a Rahu temple nearby. While the word ‚ÄúSalaan‚Äù is used to describe the area to the south of Raath, in the low-lying regions of Nayaar valley. In the upper reaches of Nayaar valley, one can still see the dying customs and rituals of Garhwal. Men wrap rough-spun tunics of Sheep's wool around their torso and women are often bedecked with a dozen ornaments. They still perform folk-dances to the tunes of traditional musical instruments. The villagers and villages here are bound with each other by a strong sense of community. Perhaps lack of infrastructure has brought them closer to each other. While the Salaan region is haunted by desertion, villages of Raath have flourished by their hard work and farming skills. Known to be a hard-working and peaceful community, people of this region have been producing the best fruits and vegetables in the region. People here are deeply religious. Religion and culture is deeply intertwined in these mountains. Although, there are many folk-deities in the Garhwal region, Ghandiyal devta is quite popular here in the upper reaches of Thalisain and with a good number of temples dedicated to him. Other than that, Goreel Devta, Deeba, Narsingh, Narankaar and several forms of mother goddess are also worshipped.

In a racing career which lasted from 1827 until 1831, The Colonel ran fifteen times and won ten races at distances ranging from six furlongs to three miles. Apart from the St Leger, his most notable successes came in the Champagne Stakes, the Epsom Craven Stakes (twice), the Great Park Stakes at Ascot and the Northampton Gold Cup. He was also placed in both the Ascot Gold Cup and Goodwood Cup. Originally trained in Yorkshire by John Scott, The Colonel later moved to the royal stable and won races for two British monarchs. Following his retirement from racing he stood as a breeding stallion in Britain and Germany with moderate results, although some of his descendants achieved success in Australia. Background The Colonel was a \\"compact\\" chestnut horse with a broad white blaze standing 15.2 hands high. He was owned and bred by Edward Petre (1794-1848), a free-spending sportsman and gambler, who was a younger son of Robert Petre, 9th Baron Petre. The Colonel was sired by the Duke of Grafton's horse Whisker who won the 1815 Epsom Derby before becoming a successful breeding stallion. His dam, an unnamed daughter of Delpini also produced My Lady, an influential broodmare whose modern descendants include Midway Lady and Eswarah. Like the rest of Edward Petre's horses, The Colonel was trained by John Scott, who sent out the winners of 41 classics, from his Whitewall Stables at Malton in North Yorkshire. The colt was ridden in most of his early races by his trainer's younger brother Bill Scott. Racing career=1827: two-year-old season= The Colonel began his racing career in a sweepstakes for two-year-olds at Leeds Racecourse on 27 June. Ridden by Bill Scott, he started favourite in a field of seven runners and \\"won easy\\" from Lord Fitzwilliam's filly Kitty. On 6 September he won a similar event at Pontefract Racecourse, beating Thomas Houldsworth's colt Vanish and two others by ten lengths \\"in a canter\\". Eleven days later, The Colonel was sent to the St Leger meeting at Doncaster where he won the fifth running of the Champagne Stakes in \\"very easy\\" style. He started the 1/3 favourite for the race which carried the condition that the winning owner had to give six dozen bottles of champagne to the Doncaster racing club. =1828: three-year-old season= The Colonel is beaten by Cadland in the deciding heat of the 1828 Derby as depicted in an aquatint by James Pollard. The Colonel made his first appearance of the season in the Derby at Epsom Downs Racecourse on 15 May. At this time, the practical difficulties involved in transporting racehorses meant that few horses from the North of England competed in the major southern courses. The Colonel's performance and reputation however, had seen him strongly supported in the betting markets since the since his win in the Champagne Stakes, and on the day he was made 7/2 favourite in a field of fifteen runners. His main rival in the betting was the Duke of Rutland's colt Cadland, the winner of the 2000 Guineas, who was ridden by Jem Robinson. Bill Scott tracked the front-running Cadland throughout the race before challenging for the lead in the straight. He briefly headed the Guineas winner a furlong from the finish, but Cadland fought back and the two horses crossed the line together. The judge declared a dead heat, much to the displeasure of The Colonel's supporters, who felt that their horse had finished the race fractionally in front. The deciding heat took place at the end of the afternoon, with The Colonel slightly favoured in the betting. Scott repeated his earlier tactics by holding The Colonel back for a late challenge, but was unable to overtake his rival and the Yorkshire colt was beaten by a neck. The Colonel returned to Yorkshire and did not run again before challenging for the St Leger at Doncaster in September. John Scott had another contender for the race in the talented but injury-prone colt Velocipede who had not been entered for the Derby. In a trial gallop shortly before the race, Velocipede decisively defeated The Colonel but sustained a leg injury in the process and appeared at Doncaster with his legs heavily bandaged. Another leading fancy for the race was the filly Bessy Bedlam, the only horse to have beaten Velocipede. In a field of nineteen runners, The Colonel, ridden as usual by Bill Scott, started the 3/1 favourite ahead of Velocipede on 7/2. After the chaotic start to the 1827 St Leger the jockeys were warned by the racecourse officials that no misconduct would be tolerated and the race began in a fair and orderly manner. Scott positioned The Colonel in third or fourth place as Velocipede made the running from Bessy Bedlam. The filly was beaten before the straight, and when Velocipede weakened a furlong from the finish The Colonel took the lead pursued by the 35/1 outsider Belinda. In the closing stages The Colonel went clear and won easily by three lengths from Belinda, with Velocipede in third. Despite the apparently decisive nature of the victory, the Sporting Magazine considered the race to be an unsatisfactory one for at least two reasons: the Scotts were criticised for using Velocipede as a pacemaker rather than allowing him to compete on his own merits, and there were strong rumours that Bessy Bedlam had been prevented from showing her best form by some kind of \\"foul play\\". Two days after his win in the St Leger, The Colonel was able to claim an uncontroversial victory when he was allowed to walk over in a sweepstakes over the same course and distance. At the end of the 1828 season, The Colonel was bought for ¬£4,000 by King George IV, who had decided to buy the horse after seeing a painting by John Frederick Herring. Following the King's dispute with the Jockey Club in 1791, his horses seldom competed at Newmarket Racecourse and often raced in the colours of Mr Delme Radcliffe. =1829: four-year-old season= The Colonel's third season was scheduled to begin with a match race against Bessy Bedlam at York Racecourse on 25 May. As The Colonel had already been moved to a stable in the south, he failed to appear for the race, allowing his opponent to claim a prize of 300 sovereigns. His only actual race of the season came the following month when he ran in the Ascot Gold Cup over two and a half miles. The race attracted an exceptionally strong field, including Cadland, Zinganee, Mameluke and The Oaks winner Green Mantle. The Colonel started the 7/2 second favourite but finished unplaced behind Zinganee. One explanation for The Colonel's poor performance at Ascot was provided by a correspondent of the Sporting Magazine. According to this anecdote The Colonel was removed from his stable on the Sunday before the race by \\"a drunken fellow\\", and ridden to an inn several miles away. The man arrived at four o'clock in the morning and repeatedly demanded to be served with a \\"pot of ale\\", only relenting and turning back to Ascot when The Colonel was recognised by one of the other guests. =1830: five-year-old season= King William IV, who inherited The Colonel in 1830. Before the start of the 1830 season, The Colonel underwent an \\"actual cautery\\" on his legs, an operation performed by the King's veterinary surgeon William Goodwin. On 25 May, The Colonel returned to Epsom for the first time since his run in the Derby. He started the 2/1 favourite against nine opponents for the Craven Stakes, an all-aged race over one and a quarter miles. Ridden by George Nelson, he took the lead after half a mile and won by two lengths without being seriously challenged from Mr Rogers' four-year-old Harold. In June he ran in his second Ascot Gold Cup and despite starting the 10/1 outsider of the field, he improved on his 1829 effort by finishing second to Sir Mark Wood's filly Lucetta, with Green Mantle third and Zinganee fourth. A week later, The Colonel appeared at Stockbridge Racecourse in Hampshire where he won a one and a half mile sweepstakes beating Ballad-Singer by a neck after \\"a beautiful race\\". Following the death of George IV on 26 June, the ownership of his horses, as well as the crown, passed to his younger brother William IV, who raced them in his own name. The Colonel made his next appearance on 11 August when he contested the Gold Cup at Goodwood Racecourse. Ridden by Pavis, he finished third of the nine runners behind the King's other runners Fleur-de- Lis and Zinganee. There was some criticism of the way in which The Colonel was used as a pacemaker in this race: the Sporting Magazine claimed that the tactics had ruined his chance in a race he was capable of winning. Later that month he appeared at the year's second Ascot meeting to contest the Great Park Stakes. Despite running over a sprint distance of six furlongs he started the 1/4 favourite and won from Donegani, a three-year-old to whom he was conceding thirty-four pounds. The Colonel ended his season on 15 September when he was allowed to walk over the three mile course to win the Gold Cup at Northampton after the other fourteen entries had been withdrawn. =1831: six-year-old season= The Colonel began his final season by running again in the Craven Stakes at Epsom. He started even money favourite and repeated his success on 1830 by beating Thomas Houldsworth's mare Fortitude and six others. The Colonel ended his racing career on 31 May in the Oatlands Stakes, a two and a half mile handicap race at Ascot. Carrying top weight of 132 pounds he ran a dead heat with Mouche a four-year-old filly who had finished second in the 1830 Oaks. He started favourite for the run-off, but was easily beaten by the filly, to whom he was conceding 29 pounds. The Colonel finished the deciding heat in considerable distress and pain as a result of aggravating an existing injury to the ligaments of his right hind leg. It took him half an hour to walk the half-mile to his stable, and he never ran again. Stud career The Colonel began his career as a breeding stallion at the King's Hampton Court stud, where his services were offered for a fee of 12 sovereigns, with a sovereign to the groom. On the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837, her horses where put up for auction, and The Colonel topped the sale as he was bought for 1,550 guineas to Richard Tattersall. In the following year he was exported to Brunswick but returned to England five years later. The Colonel's most significant offspring was probably Cap-A-Pie, a colt who was exported to Australia where he became a highly successful stallion, with his descendants including the Melbourne Cup winners The Barb, Chester and Grand Flaneur. The Colonel died at Tattersall's Willeseden Paddocks stud in 1847. Pedigree * The Colonel was inbred 3 x 4 to Highflyer, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree. He was also inbred 4 x 4 to both Eclipse and Herod.

In the centre of the complex is a unique building, as it mimics the Royal Walls of Ceuta and the moat of San Felipe. This building houses the casino, a nightclub and a restaurant. The park also has a permanent exhibition about its creator, Manrique.

Kahn (June 16, 1926 - June 3, 2012) was an electrical engineer, who invented technology for AM broadcasting. He held over 100 patents. He was primarily known for advocating several technologies designed to improve the sound quality of AM radio. His Kahn-Hazeltine system was the chief competitor to Motorola's C-Quam AM Stereo system. More than 100 stations used his stereo system before Motorola's system ultimately won out as the AM Stereo standard. Later, a part of that system was used to develop the CAM-D AM digital broadcasting technology. His other notable inventions include maximum ratio combining used in multiple output systems.Leonard also developed the Symmetra Peak for AM radio which was used to equalize the negative and positive modulation peaks prior to the F.C.C. permitting asymmetrical modulation. Another one of Leonard's developments was a system called the Voice Line. It was a combination 4 input remote mixer and studio decoder. The system modulated a carrier at approximately 3 kHz. with the low frequency components 50 Hz-250 Hz at the remote site then demodulated the 3 kHz carrier at the studio end. This was then combined with the telephone quality audio and produced a much more natural sounding broadcast ranging from 50 Hz to as high as the telephone line would permit with the exception of the sharp notch at 3 kHz to filter out the carrier. Leonard's system of AM stereo was tested and used in Mexico long before the F.C.C. permitted stereo in the United States. His system was simplicity in that it used the dual sidebands that are produced by all AM stations to transmit the left channel information on the lower sideband and the right channel on the upper sideband. Monophonic radios when tuned to the center of the carrier heard both, thus a monophonic signal. Two monophonic radios could be tuned, one above the carrier and one below to produce stereo reception. The system was very stable and worked no matter how poor the received signal was as opposed to the Motorola system which needed a very strong signal to work properly. The Kahn system was adopted by many of the high power stations due to its superiority but the ability for Motorola to manufacture chips that would only decode their system made the Motorola system the default which ultimately failed. Later, the Kahn stereo systems were used as what Leonard called the \\"Power Side\\". The power side was used to emphasize the audio on one of the two sidebands for stations that suffered from first adjacent channel interference, for example a station on 1240 suffering from interference on 1250 could load more audio on the lower sideband to force people to tune towards the 1230 sideband. The system was short lived however due to the adoption of digital tuned radios that made it impossible to tune off the center of the channel.

Career  While farming at Princethorpe, Warwickshire he devised a way of using boreholes to drain boggy land. For this innovation, and concerned that his frail health would result in the loss of his knowledge before it was shared, parliament awarded him, in 1795, ¬£1,000 and a gold ring, Edinburgh land surveyor John Johnstone (d. 1838) was employed by the Board of Agriculture to study Elkington's methods. Elkington subsequently worked in partnership with Lancelot \\"Capability\\" Brown to develop drainage plans for the latter's landscaping schemes, starting with one at Fisherwick Park near Lichfield. Elkington moved to Hey House in Staffordshire in 1797 to farm of land at Madeley, which became known as Bog Farm.  Personal life  Elkington was the eldest son of Joseph Elkington (1697‚Äì1758), a yeoman farmer, and Mary, n√©e Gallimore (died 1750). He had epilepsy. He married Sarah Webb (baptised 1738, died 1821), daughter of Richard and Mary, on 26 December 1760. Nine of their children survived Elkington. His grandson was the industrialist George Elkington. He died at Hay House on 17 October 1806 and was buried in the churchyard at All Saints, Madeley on 20 October.

The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus also issues its own revenue stamps. Revenue (1878‚Äìpresent) The first Cypriot revenue stamps were issued in 1878. The first issue consisted of Queen Victoria keytypes overprinted CYPRUS at foot. Some of the shilling values of this issue were reprinted with a different watermark in 1881, and a new design denominated in piastres was issued in 1883. Three years later, some values from the first issue were overprinted with new values in piastres, and these provisionals are quite rare. The last Queen Victoria issue was in 1898, when British unappropriated keytypes were overprinted CYPRUS and the value. In 1903, a new set was issued, with values in piastres and shillings. The piastre values were similar to the Queen Victoria 1883 issue but with the portrait of King Edward VII. The shilling values were once again British keytypes overprinted for use in Cyprus. The piastre values were reprinted a year later with a different watermark. Between 1912 and 1918, a new set portrating King George V was issued, and in 1921 some values were reprinted using a different watermark. From 1924 onwards, postage stamps were used for fiscal purposes, and therefore there were no revenues portraying King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II. When Cyprus became independent in 1960, general duty revenues were reintroduced. A set denominated in milliemes was issued, and in 1977 two of these values were surcharged with new values. Between 1983 and 1995 this set was reissued but denominated in the Cypriot pound. Between 1986 and 2001, some of these stamps were issued overprinted with the date of issue. With the adoption of the euro currency in 2008, a new set was issued bearing the coat of arms in hologram, and this consisted of nine values ranging from 7 eurocents to ‚Ç¨34.10. Postal surcharge (1882‚Äì1883) Postal Surcharge stamps were created to fulfil accounting requirements between the GPO at Larnaca and the other post offices on Cyprus. The first issue consisted of contemporary revenues as well as postage stamps with a manuscript JAB. These letters were the initials of the Larnaca postmaster Mr. J. A. Bulmer. In 1883 postage stamps were issued with the initials of the postmaster as well as a handstamp reading POSTAL SURCHARGE, and later with the handstamp only without the initials. Later that year revenues were also issued with this handstamp. From 1883 to 1885 normal revenues were used for postal surcharge purposes, and these can be identified by the Larnaca postmark as well as the initials of George Rigg Hunter (GRH), Basilio John Kipaldes (BJK), Antoine William Caruana (AWC) or Diodato Zirigovich (DZ). Penalty (1960‚Äì1999) Some values from the 1960 and 1995 revenue issues exist overprinted in Greek, Turkish and English for use as penalty stamps. These were used to pay the tax on documents filed late or insufficiently stamped. Social insurance (1956‚Äì1970) In 1956, a small design with an olive branch was issued for use as social insurance stamps. This was overprinted when Cyprus became a republic in 1960, and later that year the same design but with bilingual inscriptions was issued. This design continued to be used until about 1970.

The film was distributed in the U.S. by Columbia Pictures as a double feature with either Battle in Outer Space or 13 Ghosts, depending on the local film market. 12 to the Moon was novelized by Fred Gebhardt under the pen name Robert A. Wise and published in 1961.http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/wise_robert_a Gebhardt also wrote the film's original story. Plot Earth's International Space Order prepares for its first manned landing on the Moon, with the goal of claiming it as \\"international territory\\". The crew of Lunar Eagle 1 comprises 12 people from around the world, 10 men and two women, all scientists with different specialties, accompanied by a small menagerie, including two cats. The spaceship is commanded by American John Anderson (Ken Clark). Historical and international tensions flare up during the flight. Feodor Orloff (Tom Conway), a Russian, struts about, annoyingly claiming that all scientific advancements were invented by the Soviets. Israeli David Ruskin (Richard Weber) warns Feodor that the USSR would be unwise to attempt to dominate Israel, as it has his native Poland. David admires fellow astronaut Erich Heinrich (John Wengraf), unaware that Erich's father was the Nazi responsible for murdering David's family during the Holocaust. After a dangerous 27-hour flight, Lunar Eagle 1 lands and the crew begin their exploration of the Moon. Sigrid Bomark (Anna-Lisa) and Selim Hamid (Muzaffer Tema) find an air-filled cave and after shedding their space helmets, they kiss passionately. As they walk hand-in-hand deeper into the cave, its opening is suddenly sealed by impenetrable ice. The others discover gold and minerals, but when they fire a mortar into a rock formation, liquid begins bubbling out. An excited Feodor rushes over and sticks his hands into the flow, and he is badly burned. On the way back to their spaceship, a crew member sinks to his death in lunar quicksand. John tries unsuccessfully to save him and is almost pulled under. Inside Lunar Eagle 1, a machine begins printing out hieroglyphics. Surprisingly, Hideko Murata (Michi Kobi) can read them. It is a message from \\"The Great Coordinator of the Moon\\", who orders the crew to leave at once. The message also states that the emotionless Moon-beings live underground and fear that the Earthlings will \\"contaminate our perfect form of harmony\\". Sigrid and Salim are being studied because the Moon-beings are unfamiliar with \\"love\\". They and \\"all your kind\\" will be destroyed \\"if love turns to evil\\". The Moon-beings also demand that the expedition's cats, brought as an experiment to see if they could procreate on the Moon, be left behind. They find the felines as interesting as people. Erich has a heart attack during Lunar Eagle 1's blast off. As he babbles on half-conscious, David learns that Erich's father was the Nazi who killed David's family. However, when David learns that Erich has disowned his family and devoted his life to trying to make amends for his father's crimes, they become friends. Near Earth, the crew witnesses \\"the big freeze\\", a gigantic freezing cloud controlled from the Moon, which encases all of Canada, the U.S., and Mexico in thick ice. John decides to drop \\"atomic bomblets\\" into the volcano Popocatepetl in order to trigger a huge eruption to thaw out North America. Etienne Martel (Roger Til) sabotages the bomblets, revealing himself to be a French communist. He assumes that Feodor would also want to keep America frozen in order to advance international communism's quest for world domination. Feodor doesn't. He and Etienne fight, Feodor calls to John for help, and when Etienne unfairly pulls out a knife, John knocks the weapon out of his hand, while knocking him down. Feodor repairs the bomblets. Erich and David fly a suicide mission to drop the bomblets from their spaceship's smaller space taxi. Popocatepetl erupts and North America begins to thaw. Another message from the Moon says that the Moon-beings now realize that Earthlings are honorable and peaceful, and that the North Americans were put into suspended animation before the big freeze, so no-one has been harmed. Moreover, Earthlings will be welcomed to the Moon whenever they return. Following the great thaw, Lunar Eagle 1's triumphant crew prepare to land. Cast *Ken Clark as Capt.

Bushman as Secretary General of the International Space Order Production 12 to the Moon was in production during April-June 1959 at Hollywood's California Studios. The actual filming took seven or eight days, and the entire film was budgeted at $150,000. Although it wasn't released theatrically for another year, the American Film Institute notes that \\"According to an Oct 1959 HR [The Hollywood Reporter] news item, Columbia purchased the independent production in Aug 1959, intending to rush it into release to capitalize on the topicality of a space launch\\". Release 12 to the Moon premiered in Los Angeles on June 22, 1960. Columbia Pictures handled the theatrical release in the US and the UK during the same year. It opened in Mexico on February 23, 1961 and was also shown in Australia at an unspecified date. The film was syndicated to American television in September, 1963, as part of Screen Gems' \\"X\\" package of horror and science fiction films. Reception 1960 film critics generally found the film to be, in the words of British film critic Phil Hardy, \\"a decidedly minor offering, the presence of [DeWitt] Bodeen (writer of Cat People, 1942) and [John] Alton, one of Hollywood's unsung cinematographic geniuses, notwithstanding\\". \\"Kobe\\", writing in the June 22, 1960 issue of Variety, called 12 to the Moon a 'Lower-half science-fantasy item in which a dozen good eggs from earth tangle with some righteous, but misdirected, luna-tics. Timely, but crude and clich√©-ridden\\". \\"Kobe\\", however, also praised Alton's camerawork. The anonymous reviewer in BoxOffice referred to the film as \\"A modest science fiction programmer [which] will satisfy the youngsters and the action fans who delight in stories of rocketships to the moon\\". The magazine gave the film a rating of \\"fair\\" on its poor-to-very-good scale. According to Bill Warren, the American science fiction film critic and historian, the Monthly Film Review said the film was a \\"juvenile piece of hokum\\" with \\"only its special effects and weird lunar landscape to recommend it\\", although Kinematograph Weekly in the UK found more merit, calling 12 to the Moon \\"Extravagant and intriguing [with a] fascinating subject, sound acting [and] resourceful technical presentation\\". While modern- day critics have called the film \\"extremely strange and unpredictable\\", relatively little appears to have been written about the international status of the astronauts and the bearing it has on the plot. American film critic Gary Westphal points out that the \\"unusually large crew of twelve [is] said to represent twelve different countries\\": Brazil, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Israel, Japan, Nigeria, Poland, Russia, Sweden, Turkey, and the US, which indicates that the journey is motivated primarily by a desire \\"to prevent national disputes arising over the moon in particular and, one infers, other subjects in general\\". However, as Warren points out, \\"each person acts in accordance with national stereotypes and has virtually no other characterization\\". Modern critics have also taken the film to task for its special effects. For example, Westphal writes that the space helmets have no visors, but each is instead equipped with an \\"invisible electromagnetic ray screen\\" that protects the astronauts' faces. He speculates that the obviously missing visors were perhaps not noticed until late in the filming and that a scene which explains the ray screens was inserted prior to the film's release, before audiences could wonder about it. Bryan Senn, also an American critic, notes that \\"The effects are minimal and substandard, consisting mainly of the same shot of a rocket traveling through space used over and over again (and it's not even a convincing shot - the stars shine right through the transparent-looking ship)\\", although he calls the Moon set \\"eerie and effectively alien, with its cracks, weird shadows, and smoke seeping from mysterious holes\\". Warren points out that the Earth-saving eruption of Popocatepetl is \\"depicted by stock footage of solar prominences\\" that bear little resemblance to real volcanic eruptions. Modern critics are also bothered by the narrative development of the film. Westphal says that \\"Few films ... begin as soberly, and end as absurdly, as 12 to the Moon. The film's first thirty minutes promise an internationalized update of Destination Moon [1950], while later events rival a Flash Gordon serial\\". Senn agrees that the film is disappointing, noting that \\"What starts out as a fairly intelligent and progressive space-travel film ... quickly degenerates into a juvenile, simplistic space opera. Admittedly, space operas have their place, but 12 to the Moon fails to deliver even a single aria, much less the whole opera\\".

Mill Creek Entertainment released it again in 2015 on Region 1 DVD as part of its Vintage Sci-Fi 6 Movie Collection. Shout!

SS men were indoctrinated with the belief they were members of a \\"master race\\". The ideology of the SS was, even more so than in Nazism in general, built on the belief in a superior \\"Aryan race\\". This led to the SS playing the main role in political violence and crimes against humanity, including the Holocaust and \\"mercy killing\\" of those with congenital illnesses. After the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II, the SS and Nazi Party were found to be criminal organizations at the Nuremberg Trials.  Ideological foundations  The ideology of the SS was built upon and mainly congruent with Nazi ideology. At its center laid the belief in a superior \\"Nordic race\\" and the \\"inferiority\\" of other races. The SS also served as the central institution for the extension of Nazi ideology and its realisation. Representing the ideological opponents of the regime in one form or fashion, historian George C. Browder identified the Nazi state's list of enemies as follows: enemy states, miscegenation, the Jews, Catholicism, freemasonry, Communism, the Republic (hostility directed at the liberal republican constitution and form of government), homosexuality, moral decay, capitalists, and the \\"Old Guard\\" (hate and fear of traditionally powerful influences and institutions of the old society as unjust, retarding influences in German society). These groups became the focus of the SS‚Äîthe predominant instrument of power for the Nazi totalitarian state‚Äîas they sought to direct and influence ideology and ethics within the Reich. Himmler intended the SS to be a hierarchical system of \\"ideological fighters\\" from the organization's inception. The SS proved to be that and more, becoming the instrument most responsible for the actualization of Nazi beliefs. SS ideology comprised perhaps the single most significant philosophical dimension of Nazism, employing ontological, anthropological, and ethical elements to their methods under the guise of science, shaping the Nazi state's doctrine and crystallizing ideals (no matter how callous) into dogmatic truths. SS principles and thinking provided pseudo-scientific rationales for the devaluation of humanity, and ideological justification for Nazi violence and genocide. Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler inspecting Dachau concentration camp in 1936. The SS placed an intense emphasis in their indoctrination upon elitism and portrayed themselves as part of an \\"elite\\" order which \\"explicitly modelled [themselves] on an historical version of religious orders, such as the Teutonic Knights or the Jesuits, whose dedication to a higher idea was admired in these otherwise anti-clerical circles\\". Indoctrination Cover of a 1937 issue of Das Schwarze Korps The strict training program was focused on the fundamental ideological principles of the Nazi Party, namely the belief in a \\"superior Nordic race\\", loyalty and absolute obedience to Adolf Hitler, and hatred for those who were considered \\"inferior people\\", with great emphasis on antisemitism. Students studied the most anti-Semitic passages of Mein Kampf (\\"My Struggle\\"), Hitler's autobiographical manifesto, and the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a fraudulent anti-Semitic document first published in Russia in 1903, which purported to describe a Jewish plan for global domination. The SS educational leaders were also responsible for general anti-religious training, which was part of the Nazi attempt at \\"reversing the bourgeois-Christian system of values.\\" Educational training was clearly linked with \\"racial selection, at the end of which stood the 'weeding out' and selective breeding of human beings\\"; this facet coincided the impending Nazi effort to Germanize Europe and formed part of the policy for the racial-imperialist conquest in the East. Following the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, membership in the SS grew considerably, prompting an increase in ideological instruction. The SS- Schulungsamt took over the task of heading the educational matters of the SS, led by Karl Motz. The SS published two additional magazines for ideological propaganda: the monthly FM-Zeitschrift, funded by 350,000 non-member financial patrons of the SS, and the weekly Das Schwarze Korps, the second biggest weekly paper in Nazi Germany. As part of an effort to professionalize their officers, the SS founded a Leadership School in 1934 at the Bavarian town of Bad T√∂lz; a second school was established at Braunschweig‚Äîthese came to be known as SS-Junker Schools. Beginning in 1938, the SS intensified the ideological indoctrination of the Hitler-Jugend Landdienst (\\"Hitler Youth Land Service\\"). It set out the ideal of the German \\"Wehrbauer\\" (\\"Soldier Peasant\\"). Special high schools were created under SS control to form a Nazi agrarian \\"elite\\" that was trained according to the principle of \\"blood and soil\\". While SS leader Heinrich Himmler remained concerned about the racial elitism of his SS, it was Reinhard Heydrich, Himmler's deputy and prot√©g√©, who focused his attention on their political indoctrination through the creation of \\"racial detectives\\" who would become Hitler's \\"ideological Shock Troops\\". This being done through the Sicherheitsdienst (Security Service; SD) which was tasked with the detection of actual or potential enemies of the Nazi leadership and the neutralization of any opposition. The SD used its organization of agents and informants, all part of the development of an extensive SS state and a totalitarian regime without parallel. The SS practiced a wide variety of disciplinary measures, with punishments composed of reprimands, prohibition to wear the uniform, detention, demotion, suspension, and expulsion. Contrary to claims made by many SS-members after 1945, no one had to fear being incarcerated in a concentration camp for delinquencies. Starting in June 1933, the SS had its own courts to deal with crimes and misdemeanors within its ranks. On 17 October 1939, Himmler succeeded in having the SS put under its own special jurisdiction. Once this change occurred, SS-members could no longer be tried in civil courts. Even though Himmler and the other SS leaders repeatedly demanded sobriety within their ranks, alcoholism was a frequent problem. For example, between 1937‚Äì38 some 700 members were excluded from the SS for \\"listlessness and laziness.\\" In the same period a further 12,000 left the SS for unknown reasons, calling into question the institution's claims of \\"loyalty for life\\". = Meritocracy= The SS itself was meritocratic in its general operational structure, following the Nazi principle of Volksgemeinschaft. In contrast to the German army's traditions, officer promotions in the SS were based on the individual's commitment and political reliability, not on Junker status or upper-class family background. Consequently, the SS officer schools offered a military career option for those of modest social background, which was not usually possible in the Wehrmacht. The relationship between officers and soldiers was also less formal than in the regular armed forces. Though SS membership was open to all who met Himmler's eugenic and genealogical standards, many of the men first to enter the SS came from the aristocracy. In addition, academics were twofold over- represented in the SS in comparison to the general population. Racial policies Consistent with the eugenic and racial policies of the Third Reich, Himmler advocated racial elitism for his SS members. Racial criteria like proving pure \\"Aryan\\" lineage back to 1750 or 1800 constituted part of the vetting for entrance into the SS. Throughout the existence of the SS, its members were regularly encouraged to procreate to maintain and increase the \\"Aryan-Nordic bloodline\\"; the SS members, along with their wives and children, were to become an exclusive racial community (Sippengemeinschaft) within the Nazi state. Along these lines, Himmler stated on 8 November 1937 at a Gruppenf√ºhrer meeting in Munich in the officers' quarters: ::The SS is a National Socialist order of soldiers of Nordic race and a community of their clans bound together by oath ... what we want for Germany is a ruling class destined to last for centuries and the product of repeated selection, a new aristocracy continuously renewed from the best of the sons and daughters of our nation, a nobility that never ages, stretching back into distant epochs in its traditions, where these are valuable, and representing eternal youth for our nation. Hitler subscribed to these views and once remarked that the \\"elite\\" of the future Nazi state would stem from the SS since \\"only the SS practices racial selection.\\" Wives of SS members were scrutinized accordingly for their \\"racial fitness\\", and marriages had to be approved through official channels as part of the SS ideological mandate. According to their ideology, SS men were believed to be the bearers of the very best of the so-called Nordic blood, and it was their ideological tenets and scholarly justifications that shaped numerous Nazi actions and policies, merging racial determinism, Nordicism, and antisemitism. A Lebensborn facility in 1936 An SS Doctors' Leader School was established in the small village of Alt-Rehse which encouraged the practice of \\"racial hygiene\\" and focused on the future of \\"German genetic streams\\" (deutsche Erbstr√∂me). Medical journal articles written by SS intellectuals stressed the importance of genetic heritage, arguing that \\"biology and genetics are the roots from which the National Socialist worldview has derived its knowledge, and from which it continues to derive new strength.\\" In order to promote its role as a preserver of Germanic heritage, the SS founded the Ahnenerbe institute in 1935. It conducted anthropological, historical, and archeological studies to provide \\"scientific\\" backing for Himmler's ideals. From its founding until 1939, the institute commissioned studies on places like the Viking village Hedeby, and even conducted erratic studies into medieval witch-hunts; Himmler believed these witch-hunts were murders committed by the Roman Catholic Church against Germanic women of \\"good blood\\". After World War II started, the Ahnenerbe was heavily involved in medical experiments conducted at concentration camps‚Äîmany of these experiments were cruel and inhumane, costing the lives of thousands of inmates. Not only was contact with racial \\"others\\" a concern of the SS and its agencies, but attrition through war was an additional factor. Fear of losing a large percentage of Germanic racial stock once the Second World War began drove SS ideology, as victory in the field could not prevail without a corresponding biological legacy of children to carry on the mission. Himmler stressed that SS men were obliged to procreate to preserve Germany's genetic legacy so the \\"master race\\" could secure and sustain the \\"Thousand Year Reich\\" of the future. However, SS men did not fulfill the expectations: at the end of 1938, 57% of the members were still unmarried, only 26% had fathered a child and just 8% had reached Himmler's desired goal of at least four children. Also in 1935, the SS initiated Lebensborn, an association created to provide unmarried, pregnant women of \\"good blood\\" with opportunities to deliver their children, who were then given up for adoption into families deemed racially suited. The Lebensborn facilities were situated in remote locations, guaranteeing the anonymity of the women. Lebensborn was only moderately successful, producing only an estimated 8,000 - 11,000 births in the ten years of its existence. After the beginning of World War II, the SS recruited large numbers of non-Germans from the \\"inferior races\\" espoused by the Nazi and SS ideology. To justify this contradiction, Himmler began to stress a shared European identity more strongly in the early 1940s, promising that \\"all those who are of good blood will be given the possibility to grow into the German Volk\\". According to historian Mark P. Gingerich, of the one million Waffen-SS men who served during the war, over half were not even German citizens. Attitude toward religion According to Himmler biographer Peter Longerich, Himmler saw a main task of the SS to be that of \\"acting as the vanguard in overcoming Christianity and restoring a Germanic way of living\\" as part of preparations for the coming conflict between \\"humans and subhumans\\". Longerich writes that, while the Nazi movement as a whole launched itself against Jews and Communists, \\"by linking de-Christianisation with re-Germanization, Himmler had provided the SS with a goal and purpose all of its own.\\" Himmler was vehemently opposed to Christian sexual morality and the \\"principle of Christian mercy\\", both of which he saw as a dangerous obstacle to his planned battle with \\"subhumans\\". In 1937, he said that the movement was an era of the \\"ultimate conflict with Christianity\\" and that \\"It is part of the mission of the SS to give the German people in the next half century the non-Christian ideological foundations on which to lead and shape their lives.\\" The SS developed an anti-clerical agenda. Chaplains were not allowed in its units for instance (although they were allowed in the regular army). The Sicherheitsdienst (Security Service; SD) department of the SS and Gestapo under Reinhard Heydrich were used to identify and assist other Nazi organizations in suppressing Catholic influence in the press, youth clubs, schools, publications, and in discouraging pilgrimages and religious processions. Himmler used the Jesuits as the model for the SS, since he found they had the core elements of absolute obedience and the cult of the organisation. Hitler is said to have called Himmler \\"my Ignatius of Loyola\\". As an order, the SS needed a coherent doctrine that would set it apart. Himmler attempted to construct such an ideology, and deduced a \\"pseudo- Germanic tradition\\" from history. Himmler dismissed the image of Christ as a Jew and rejected Christianity's basic doctrine and its institutions. Starting in 1934, the SS hosted \\"solstice ceremonies\\" (Sonnenwendfeiern) to increase team spirit within their ranks. In a 1936 memorandum, Himmler set forth a list of approved holidays based on pagan and political precedents meant to wean SS members from their reliance on Christian festivities. In an attempt to replace Christianity and suffuse the SS with a new doctrine, SS-men were able to choose special Lebenslauffeste, substituting common Christian ceremonies such as baptisms, weddings and burials. Since the ceremonies were held in small private circles, it is unknown how many SS-members opted for these kind of celebrations. = Rejection of Christian precepts = Many of the concepts promoted with the SS violated accepted Christian doctrine, but neither Himmler nor his deputy Heydrich expected the Christian church to support their stance on abortion, contraception or sterilization of the unfit ‚Äì let alone their shared belief in polygamy for the sake of racial propagation. This did not however represent disbelief in a higher power from either man nor did it deter them on their ideological quest. In fact, atheism was banned within the SS as Himmler believed it to be a form of egotism that placed the individual at the center of the universe, and thus constituted a rejection of the SS principle of valuing the collective over the individual. All SS men were required to list themselves as Protestant, Catholic or gottgl√§ubig (\\"Believer in God\\"). Himmler preferred the neo-pagan \\"expression of spirituality\\". Still, by 1938 \\"only 21.9 percent of SS members described themselves as gottgl√§ubig, whereas 54 percent remained Protestant and just under 24 percent Catholic.\\" Belief in God among the SS did not constitute adherence to traditional Christian doctrine nor were its members consummate theologians, as the SS outright banned certain Christian organizations like the International Bible Research Association, a group whose pacifism the SS rejected. Dissenting religious organizations like the Jehovah's Witnesses were severely persecuted by the SS for their pacifism, failure to participate in elections, non-observance of the Hitler salute, not displaying the Nazi flag, and for their non-participation in Nazi organizations; many were sent to concentration camps where they perished. Heydrich once quipped that any and all opposition to Nazism originated from either \\"Jews or politicized clergy.\\" = Neo-pagan doctrine = The Wewelsburg was the most important site in Himmler's pseudo-Germanic religious doctrine. In order to promote his religious ideas and link them to an alleged Germanic tradition, Himmler began to establish cult sites. The most important of these was the Wewelsburg, close to Paderborn. The SS leased the castle in 1934, after Himmler had first seen it in November 1933 while campaigning with Hitler. Originally planned as a school for high ranking SS- men, the castle soon became the object of far reaching construction plans, with an aim at establishing the Wewelsburg as the \\"ideological center\\" of the SS and its pseudo-Germanic doctrine. In accordance with the other efforts of Himmler to replace Christian rituals and establish the SS as the Nazi \\"elite\\", the Wewelsburg received special rooms, such as crypts, a General's hall with a sun wheel embedded in the floor and a crest hall. As a second location, Himmler ordered for a memorial of 4,500 giant foundlings to be placed near Verden an der Aller, the scene of the infamous Massacre of Verden in 782, calling the place Sachsenhain. At the sight of the Externsteine, which at the time was believed to be close to the scene of the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, Himmler ordered excavations to take place there in order to prove that Christian monks had destroyed a Germanic cult site known as Irminsul during the Middle Ages. As a last site of Himmler's cult, the SS took over and remodelled Quedlinburg Abbey, burial place of Henry the Fowler, who was celebrated by Himmler for his refusal to be anointed by a Roman bishop. Himmler also instituted these rites and rituals to try and foster a greater sense of belonging to a fraternal order. For example, each year on the anniversary of the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch, the SS men duty-bound for the military units were sworn in at 10:00 pm in front of Hitler. There by torchlight they swore \\"obedience unto death\\". However, these attempts to establish a new, neo-pagan religion were not successful. Historian Heinz H√∂hne observes that the \\"neo-pagan customs\\" Himmler introduced into the SS \\"remained primarily a paper exercise\\". Most of Himmler's attempts to link \\"old Teutonic\\" traditions into the spiritual life of the SS and society at large were criticised by the Church as a form of \\"new heathenism.\\" Although the SS never endorsed Christian beliefs, the traditional rituals and practices of the Christian faith were generally tolerated and respected. According to Bastian Hein, two reasons contributed to Himmler's Ersatz religion never catching on: On the one hand, Himmler himself was in a constant search for religious certainty, leaving his doctrine vague and unclear. On the other hand, Hitler personally intervened after the churches lamented the \\"neo-heathenish\\" tendencies within the SS, telling Himmler and Alfred Rosenberg to \\"cut out the cultic nonsense\\". Culture of violence Executions of Jews by SS-led mobile killing units (Einsatzgruppen) near Ivanhorod, now Ukraine. The SS was built on a culture of violence, which was exhibited in extreme form by the mass murder of civilians and prisoners on the Eastern Front. Historian Hans Buchheim wrote that the mentality and ideal values of the SS men were to be \\"hard,\\" with no emotions such as love or kindness; hatred for the \\"inferior\\" and contempt for anyone who was not in the SS; unthinking obedience; \\"camaraderie\\" with fellow members of the SS; and an intense militarism that saw the SS as part of an \\"elite order\\" fighting for a better Germany. The principal \\"enemy\\" of the SS, represented as a force of uncompromising, utter evil and depravity, was \\"world Jewry\\". Members of the SS were encouraged to fight against the \\"Jewish Bolshevik sub-humans\\". The SS value of \\"fighting for fighting's sake\\" could be traced back to the values of the front-line German soldiers in World War I and the post-war Freikorps, and in turn led SS members to see violence as the highest possible value, and conventional morality as a hindrance to achieving victory. The SS mentality fostered violence and \\"hardness\\". The ideal SS man was supposed to be in a state of permanent readiness. As historian Hans Buchheim quips, \\"the SS man had to be forever on duty.\\" For members of the SS their mentality was such that for them, nothing was impossible no matter how arduous or cruel, to include the \\"murder of millions\\". SS men who attempted to live by that principle of violence had an unusually high suicide rate. The \\"soldierly\\" values of the SS were specific to the German post-World War I concept of the \\"political soldier\\" who was indoctrinated to be a \\"fighter\\" who would devote his life to struggling for the nation. Although not an SS document, the 1930 book Krieg und Krieger (\\"War and Warriors\\"), edited by Ernst J√ºnger, with contributions by Friedrich Georg J√ºnger, Friedrich Hielscher, Werner Best and Ernst von Salomon, served as an excellent introduction to the intellectual traditions from which the SS ideal arose. The essays in Krieg und Krieger called for a revolutionary reorganization of German society, which was to be led by \\"heroic\\" leaders who would create a \\"new moral code\\" based upon the idea that life was a never- ending, Social Darwinian \\"struggle\\" that could only be settled with violence. The book claimed that Germany had only been defeated in the First World War because the country had been insufficiently \\"spiritually mobilized\\", and what was required to win the next war was the proper sort of \\"heroic\\" leaders, unhindered by conventional morality, who would do what was necessary to win. The values of the \\"heroic realism\\" literature gloried the principle and practice of fighting to the death regardless of the military situation. Out of the intellectual heritage of the \\"heroic realism\\" literature came a rejection of the traditional values of Christianity and the enlightenment (principles which were considered too sentimental); what emerged in its place was a cold indifference to the value of human life. Marriage of the image of the \\"fighter\\" from \\"heroic realism\\" literature and the practical need of the SS to serve as political cadres for the National Socialist state, led to the elevation of the concept of \\"duty\\" as the highest obligation of the SS man. The SS ethos called for \\"achievement for achievement's sake\\", where achievement ranked as the highest measurement of success. As such, winning at all costs regardless the sacrifice became a supreme SS virtue. The SS principle of loyalty above all, as reflected in the official slogan \\"My honour is loyalty\\", was severed from traditional moral considerations and instead focused entirely upon Hitler. The idealized and distorted version of German history, which the organisation espoused, was intended to instill pride in members of the SS. Himmler admonished the SS against pity, neighborly love, and humility, instead celebrating hardness and self-discipline. Indoctrinating the SS to perceive racial \\"others\\" and state enemies as undeserving of their pity, helped create an environment and a mental framework where the men saw acts of wanton violence against those same enemies, not as a crime, but part of their patriotic obligation to the Nazi state. Ideology of genocide Photo from J√ºrgen Stroop's report to Heinrich Himmler from May 1943 on liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto. As historian Claudia Koonz points out, \\"the cerebral racism of the SS provided the mental armor for mass murderers.\\" When Himmler visited Minsk and witnessed a mass killing of 100 people, he made a speech to the executioners emphasizing the need to put orders over conscience, saying that \\"soldiers ... had to carry out every order unconditionally\\". According to historian George Stein, unquestioning obedience and \\"submission to authority\\" on the part of the SS represented one of the ideological \\"foundation stones\\" to combat the party's enemies. As the Waffen- SS took part in the invasions of eastern European countries and the Soviet Union, the men wrote of their \\"great service in saving western civilization from being overrun by Asiatic Communism.\\" One Waffen-SS recruiting pamphlet told potential members that answering the call meant being \\"especially bound to the National Socialist ideology,\\" a doctrine which implied both an ideological battle and a racial struggle against subhumans (Untermenschen) accompanied by an unprecedented brutalization of warfare. Participation in the \\"repellant task\\" of becoming psychologically involved in the killings was a rite of initiation of sorts and showed just how \\"internalized\\" the Nazi beliefs were for members of the SS. It was also part of the rhetoric of legitimation that gave meaning to their acts of extermination and habituated the SS to an ideology of genocide. Special SS death squads known as Einsatzgruppen were used for large-scale extermination and genocide of Jews, gypsies, Asians, and communists. On 17 June 1941, Heydrich briefed the leaders of the Einsatzgruppen and their subordinate units on the general policy of killing Jews in the Soviet lands. SD member Walter Blume later testified that Heydrich called Eastern Jews the \\"reservoir of intellectuals for Bolshevism,\\" and said that the \\"state leadership held the view that [they] must be destroyed.\\" The SS Einsatzgruppen were supplemented by the specially created Order Police (drawn from Germany and/or the local populations) who were indoctrinated by the SS to also take part in mass killings. One Order Police participant named Kurt M√∂bius testified during a postwar trial, that he believed the SS propaganda about the Jews being \\"criminals and sub-humans\\" who had caused \\"Germany's decline after the First World War.\\" He went on to state that evading \\"the order to participate in the extermination of the Jews\\" never entered his mind. One SS officer, Karl Kretschmer, \\"saw himself as a representative of a cultured people fighting a primitive, barbaric enemy,\\" and wrote to his family of the need to desensitize himself from the mass killings. Burleigh and Wippermann write: \\"Members of the SS administered, tortured, and murdered people with a cold, steely precision, and without moral scruples.\\" An SS officer selecting Jews for extermination in gas chambers at the Auschwitz concentration camp The SS and its accompanying principles represented the realization of Nazi ideology and played a crucial role in the extermination of European Jews that followed the Nazis' rise to power. As historian Gerald Reitlinger states, while the idealism and machinery of the SS as a state within a state will all be forgotten, their acts of \\"...racial transplantations, the concentration camps, the interrogation cells of the Gestapo, the medical experiments of the living, the mass reprisals, the manhunts for slave labor and the racial exterminations will be remembered forever.\\" Historian Hans Buchheim argues there was no coercion to murder Jews and others, and all who committed such actions did so out of free will. He wrote that chances to avoid executing criminal orders \\"were both more numerous and more real than those concerned are generally prepared to admit\\". Buchheim commented that until the middle of 1942, the SS had been a strictly volunteer organization, and that anyone who joined the SS after the Nazis had taken over the German government either knew or came to know that he was joining an organization that would be involved in atrocities of one sort or another. There is no known record of an SS officer refusing to commit an atrocity; they willingly did so, and then cherished the awards they received for doing it. Initially the victims were killed with gas vans or firing squad by SS Einsatzgruppen units, but these methods proved impracticable for an operation of the scale carried out by the Nazi state. In August 1941, SS leader Himmler attended the shooting of 100 Jews at Minsk. Nauseated and shaken by the experience, he was concerned about the impact such actions would have on the mental health of his SS men. He decided that alternate methods of killing should be found. On his orders, by spring 1942 the camp at Auschwitz had been greatly expanded, including the addition of gas chambers, where victims were killed using the pesticide Zyklon B. Industrialized killing at the SS operated extermination camps made these Nazi-conceived institutions into places where the productive output was corpses. By the end of the war, at least eleven million people, including 5.5 to 6 million Jews and between 200,000 and 1,500,000 Romani people had been killed by the Nazi state with assistance by collaborationist governments and recruits from occupied countries. Historian Enzo Traverso asserts that massacring millions of people was part of the Nazi ideology comprising \\"total war,\\" which constituted their attempt at conquest for both \\"racial\\" and colonial purposes. Acting on Hitler's orders, Himmler was a main architect of the Holocaust and the SS was the main branch of the Nazi Party that implemented it. Post-war On 23 May 1945, Himmler, who had been responsible for so much of the SS doctrine and that of the Nazi state, committed suicide after he was captured by the Allies. Other senior members of the SS fled. Chief of the Reich Main Security Office, SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer Ernst Kaltenbrunner, who was the highest-ranking member of the SS upon Himmler's suicide, was captured in the Bavarian Alps and tried at the Nuremberg Tribunal along with other leading Nazis like Hermann G√∂ring, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Alfred Rosenberg, Hans Frank, among others. Kaltenbrunner was convicted of crimes against humanity and executed on 16 October 1946. Other SS intellectuals and physicians were also brought to trial and convicted, including the SS Ahnenerbe doctors who killed the enfeebled and/or disabled persons deemed \\"unworthy to live\\" or who performed medical experiments on concentration camp prisoners. During questioning after the war, many of the SS doctors from the concentration camps avowed that the allegiance they had sworn to Hitler superseded any of the rituals performed at medical school to say nothing of the Hippocratic Oath they had otherwise ignored. SS members absolved themselves through the pseudo-scientific justification that they were merely acting as instruments (men of action) on behalf of the German people in pursuit of \\"racial hygiene.\\" Similar strategies of negation and dismissal of responsibility were displayed by SS men during their post-war trials, either by way of legitimizing their actions as a result of unconditional obedience to their superiors (intimating responsibility onto them) or through the use of innocuous sounding bureaucratic language. Given the impact that the Nazi ideology had on the European continent in causing a catastrophic war and unparalleled crimes, the Allied powers demilitarized Germany and divided the country into four occupation zones. They also began the process of denazification (Entnazifizierung). This was essentially an effort to \\"purge\\" the German people of the Nazi ideology that had pushed them to war and resulted in the Holocaust. Astonishingly, many members of the SS, including some from the upper echelons, faced little more than a stint in a POW camp, a short denazification hearing and were treated with \\"remarkable leniency\\".

She was the fourth African-American woman to receive a PhD in Mathematics.According to Kenschaft: Change Is Possible: Stories of Women and Minorities in Mathematics, American Mathematical Society, 2005, p. 5, she has been the fifth. Her main research interests were in group theory and abstract algebra. She is the first African American woman to chair a math department in the United States. Early life and education Hewitt was born on October 26, 1935 in Sumter, South Carolina. She entered Fisk University in 1952 and graduated in 1956 with a degree in secondary mathematics education. The department chairman, Lee Lorch, who Hewitt worked under for two years, recommended Hewitt to two schools, without her knowledge. Therefore, in her senior year, Hewitt was offered a fellowship from the University of Washington without applying for it. She received her Ph.D. in mathematics in 1962 from the University of Washington, with a thesis on \\"Direct and Inverse Limits of Abstract Algebras\\" (completing her masters in 1960).Charlene Morrow and Teri Perl (eds), Notable Women in Mathematics, Greenwood Press, 1998, pp. 76‚Äì79. Career In 1961, Hewitt joined the faculty at the University of Montana. In 1966 she became tenured and promoted to associate professor, then in 1972, to full professor. In 1995, she was elected chair of the Department of Mathematical Science. She served in that position until she retired in June 1999, with the title of Professor Emeritus. While a professor at the University of Montana she participated in multiple other organizations. She served on the executive council of the mathematical honor society, Pi Mu Epsilon. She served on the chair of the committee that writes questions for the mathematics section of the GREs. Hewitt was also a faculty consultant for the Advanced Placement examination in calculus. In 1995, she was awarded an ETS Certificate of Appreciation after twelve years of service. Hewitt served on the Board of Governors of the Mathematical Association of America. She was known for many mathematics reason but most of all for being one of the first three black women to get a mathematics award. Hewitt's works focus on two mathematic areas: abstract algebra and group theory. She has eight published research papers and twenty-one unpublished lectures. One would expect Hewitt to have to faced many racial and gender oriented obstacles; however, in a personal interview she stated that she did not feel there had been any racial incidences in her career that had a detrimental effect on her studies. She did however, write an article in the Annals of the New York Academy of Science, titled \\"The Status of Women in Mathematics\\". Hewitt has said that \\"Some of my fellow graduate students did all they could to help and encourage me. They included me in most of their activities. I know this situation was not the norm for a lot of Blacks studying mathematics, but I was fortunate enough to be at the right place at the right time\\" Awards and recognition She was awarded a prestigious National Science Foundation postdoctoral Science Faculty Fellowship. She was elected to the board of governors of the Mathematical Association of America.

This service was founded in 2004, and was included in the structure of the Ministry of Health Care of Russia until 2012. In May 2012 Rospotrebnadzor was removed from being under the supervision of the Ministry of Health and now reports directly to the Russian Government. It functions on the authority of the Act of Federal Service on the base of the Administrative Regulation. History The organization's history goes back to the Decree of the Council of People's Commissars of the RSFSR \\"On the sanitary authorities of the Republic\\" dated 15 September 1922. Up until 2004, 2218 separate sanitary-epidemiological stations (centers) functioned in Russia. The current structure of the organization was determined by the decree of the President of Russia on March 9, 2004 No. 314 \\"On the system and structure of federal bodies of executive power\\". It initially reported to the Ministry of Health. In accordance with the presidential decree of May 21, 2012 No. 636 \\"On the structure of federal executive bodies\\", it is now under the direct oversight of the Government of Russia. From the establishment of the Federal Service (2004) until October 2013, it was headed by Gennady Onishchenko. The current head of Rospotrebnadzor is Anna Popova. The service currently employs, in total, approximately 110,000 professionals in its various bodies and organizations.  Rospotrebnadzor and permissive documents Rospotrebnadzor in the plan of regulating of the state functions connected with the technical regulation, evaluation of conformity or other kinds of state regulating performs the following functions: * Performs the sanitary control, control and issuing some kinds of permissive documents; * Performs licensing of certain kinds of activities; * Performs certification of different objects of evaluating of conformity to Russian legislation. * Performs sanitary certification of production according to the requirements of the Customs Union; * Performs state registration of production of the RF (excepting medicaments); * Performs state registration of production of the Customs Union on the territory of Russia (with the exception of pharmaceuticals). Even listing the kinds of activities of Rospotrebnadzor, connected with drawing up different kinds of permissive documents makes a significant list. Let's give more details about some certain directions while receiving permissive documents. Permissive documents in the plan of sanitary control and supervision Permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor are issued in the form of Permit for exploitation of buildings and premises. This document testifies about the fact that the premises conforms to the requirements to performing a certain kind of activity and providing some kind of service. This document is obligatory for receiving for owners of restaurants and cafes, food shops and swimming pools, children's preschool, school institutions, medical cabinets and clinics, by providing hair-dresser, laundry and other similar institutions. The function of permissive document is brought by negotiation of the Program of Industrial Control of an object of any legal entity or an individual entrepreneur that applied to Rospotrebnadzor in order to draw up a sanitary conclusion or permit for exploitation or in other cases. This Program appears to be the plan of sanitary measurements of an organization or institutions that allow meet all the requirements of the Russian sanitary legislation. Permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor by licensing It is clear that such kind of permissive documents is called a license, that is drawn up after performing an analysis of the documents presented before the body of licensing, that prove performing all the requirements of licensing set for the certain kind of activities. Rospotrebnadzor is authorized to draw up permissive documents for the following directions of licensed kinds of entrepreneurship: * Activities connected with application of provocatives of infection diseases; * Activities connected with application of sources of ionizing radiation. Issuing different kinds of documents is performed both by territorial bodies of Rospotrebnadzor and its central apparatus depending on the class of danger of apparatus of ionizing radiation and the class of danger of provocatives of infection diseases. Drawing up permissive documents is primarily required for meeting requirements of the Federal Law \\"About Sanitary Well Being of the population of the RF\\". Permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor by performing certification in the sphere of sanitary safety The kind of drawn up permissive documents primarily depends on the object suffering evaluation of conformity. So, for many kinds of production it was required to draw up the sanitary-epidemiologic conclusion. The SEC, this was the widely known name of thus famous document. But from 1 July 2012 issuing of these permissive documents was stopped. They were replaced by the Certificate of State Registration of the Customs Union and the Expert Conclusion. The Expert Conclusion is not the direct analog of the SEC. Earlier, until 1 July 2010, the mandatory sanitary-epidemiologic conclusion (SEC) or hygienic certificate for realization both Russian and foreign goods were required for the most part of production on the Russian market. All the children's goods, all the production that we eat, drink or wear, or all that we use in our everyday life underwent the mandatory evaluation of conformity to SNiPs or SanPins. After the moment that the legislation of the Customs Union went into force, for some groups of goods that may do the most significant harm with their unquality, it became necessary to prove the conformity with the help of the unified requirements of the CU by means of drawing up of the Certificate of State Registration of the CU. In the same document, that states the list of such production (Decision of the CU Commission 299 of 28 May 2010) in the first part there is a list of the goods for which by crossing the border of the RF (CU) there can be the necessity of sanitary-epidemiologic control. In this case for this kind of production we'll need the hygienic certificate ‚Äì the Expert Conclusion of the Rospotrebnadzor. The Expert Conclusion of the Rospotrebnadzor unlike the SEC appears to be the voluntary document. As the situation of the sanitary control may occur or may not occur. The reason why the customs services may require sanitary documents and going through hygienic control of the load may be as follows: Injured cartridge, conveyor or other kind of package in which transportation of the load is performed; Mismatch between documents and loads detected; There is information about breaking that is connected with given delivery, about mismatch between the documents and the contents of the transport units and in some other cases. Permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor by performing the sanitary supervision of the Customs Union (CU) The permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor are mandatory to draw up for the production included into the List of the goods to go through sanitary control by crossing the border of the CU, that was approved by the Commission of the CU on 18 July 2010. If the production is included into the first part of this document, so the kind of the permissive document of the Rospotrebnadzor is the Expert Conclusion. If the production is included into the second part of the document, so the kind of the document of Rospotrebnadzor is the Certificate of State Registration of the CU. The both documents are possible to be received only on the base of the Expert Conclusion after the performed certification tests, done by the certification laboratory (having authorization of the CU). They prove that the studied product meets the Unified sanitary requirements of the three countries the Union members. Such documents must be received also for these kinds of Russian production if they are firstly manufactured for realization on the market of the Customs Union. The volume of the production items for which it is required the following permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor is reduced nearly ten times in comparison with the list of goods for which it is necessary to draw up the SEC and (or) the Certificate of State Registration of the RF. In the cases that the production went through the sanitary supervision on the base of the Russian Sanitary Rules and in the present it needs drawing up the sanitary permissive document of the Rospotrebnadzor in accordance with the requirements of the legislation of the CU, bet nevertheless the customs inspection requires the document of proof, but also it is necessary to apply to Rospotrebnadzor. In such situations you will receive the drawn up the Exemption Letter of Rospotrebnadzor. But the information, which it usually comprises, is of the general legislative character (it can be read in the laws of the CU). That is why the consultants recommend draw up the Expert Conclusion of Rospotrebnadzor in such cases. Permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor by State registration of production The permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor were issued till the end of 2012 for the production that in accordance with the national legislation required its inclusion into the State Registry before its start of realization on the territory of the RF. The permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor drawn up on the blank of the Certificate of State Registration of the RF will be valid on the territory of Russia till the end of the year. The permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor of State Registration of the CU Such a document is drawn up from 1 July 2010 and is called the Certificate of State Registration of the CU. On which it is required to draw up the given permissive documents. The above-mentioned article describes it. As the Certificate of State Registration of the CU replaced two earlier existing Russian documents proving the sanitary safety of production and duplicating each other. Earlier entrepreneurs had to go through the same procedure of proving conformity of production to sanitary requirements of the Russian legislation twice. The Certificate of the CU replaced the Sanitary- Epidemiologic Conclusion and the Certificate of State Registration of the RF.

The duo discover that the Soviets intend launching an ICBM sneak attack against the United States on the night that they arrive. The Russians are using information gathered by Sputnik to plan the attack, and as the American spies' attempt to sabotage one rocket fails, they are shot. Back in the United States, as the missile closes in, a radio reporter stays on the air to assist those threatened in this emergency as American defense missiles prove too slow to defend the country. The reporter's wife knows this will be his death sentence. As Manhattan is hit and 3 million are killed, a general bemoans the lack of a functioning ICBM missile defense system. The efforts to strengthen the US defense system were unsuccessful owing to limited funding and effort. The US retaliation is expected to be minimal as the Russian defenses have been properly funded and maintained.

He attended St Aloysius' College, Sydney Grammar School and the University of Sydney, receiving a Bachelor of Arts in 1951 and a Bachelor of Law in 1956. On 13 November 1954 at the Holy Family Catholic Church in Lindfield he married Elizabeth Margaret Moultrie Connolly. He was called to the Bar on 8 February 1957 and specialised in land law, co-writing Landlord and Tenant Practice and Procedure in New South Wales (1958, 1966, 1971), a standard text in the area. A staunch Catholic and anti-communist, Mackerras left the Liberal Party to join the Democratic Labor Party (DLP), of which he was the inaugural New South Wales branch secretary. He stood as a DLP candidate at the 1972 Mosman by- election receiving 9.53% of the vote. He also sat on the state executive of the party until he resigned in 1972, believing that the election of the Whitlam Labor government marked the fulfilment of the DLP's objective. Mackerras was also a supporter of the New England New State Movement, and also encouraged Asian immigration on the condition that it did not lead to an influx of communists. On 9 November 1973, Mackerras moved to Moree as a solicitor with the Aboriginal Legal Service, having noted the lack of representation for local Aboriginal youths. However, this proved difficult for his family, and in 1975 they relocated to Kellys Plains, near Armidale, with Mackerras becoming a solicitor at Uralla. Mackerras devoted the rest of his professional life to the Aboriginal cause; in one case, directing the successful appeal of an Aboriginal boy's gaol sentence, the bond condition forbade the boy to fraternise with Mackerras. He favoured self-determination for the Aboriginal people. Elizabeth had died in 1980, and Mackerras died of myocardial infarction on 1 August 1987 at Armidale, survived by nine children.

It is based on the account of a single investigator who interviewed witnesses to the purported event and then wrote a letter to the Vatican Observatory. Overview The event received little attention until 1995, when British astronomer Mark E. Bailey found in the Vatican Library archives a 1931 issue of L'Osservatore Romano, which contained a dispatch from the Franciscan friar Fedele d'Alviano. D'Alviano had visited the region five days after the event and interviewed people from the region; they told him they were frightened by what had happened. According to Bailey, the Curu√ß√° event was one of the most important impact events of the 20th century. Inspired by Bailey's article and based on images from Landsat satellites, the Brazilian astrophysicist Ramiro de la Reza attempted to find an astrobleme‚Äîthe remains of a meteorite impact crater. He explored a circular feature measuring 1 km in diameter, to the southeast of the village of Argemiro, but found no evidence for impact. In the first week of June 1997, de la Reza led an expedition organized by Rede Globo and co- financed by ABC Television of Australia, to the region where the event is said to have occurred. Subsequent researchers have concluded that the circular feature is unrelated to the reported event, and is not an impact crater.http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.177.2473&rep;=rep1&type;=pdf#page=160 Assuming that the reported event was an air burst, various researchers have estimated the initial mass of the meteor at between 1,000 and 25,000 tons. Estimates for the energy released have varied from 9 kilotons, 100 kilotons, and 5 megatons, though most estimates place the energy at below 1 megaton.

Zara (8 March 1902 - 15 October 1978) was a Filipino engineer and physicist. He was the inventor of the first two-way videophone.  Education  A native of Lipa, Batangas, Zara finished primary schooling at Lipa Elementary School, where he graduated as valedictorian in 1918. In 1922, he again graduated valedictorian in Batangas High School, an accolade which warranted him a grant to study abroad. However the scholarship was given to another student upon the intervention of a public official. With full support from his parents he then enrolled at the University of the Philippines in Manila. In the middle of his first semester, he finally got the scholarship when his rival got sick and died abroad. Dr. Zara then enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the United States, and graduated with a degree of BS in Mechanical Engineering in 1926. After that he obtained a Master of Science in Engineering (Aeronautical Engineering) at the University of Michigan, graduating summa cum laude. Zara then sailed to France to take up advanced studies in physics at the University of Paris. In 1930 he again graduated summa cum laude with a degree of Doctor of Science in Physics, with \\"Tres Honorable,\\" the highest honor conferred to graduate students. Zara was the first Filipino given that honor. Madam Marie Curie was given the same accolade for her discovery of radium.  Career  Upon his return to the Philippines, Dr. Zara was appointed technical assistant on aviation matters in the office of the Secretary of Department of Public Works and Communications (DPWC). Subsequently, he became chief of the aeronautical division of the DPWC. In 1936, he was assistant director and chief aeronautical engineer in the Bureau of Aeronautics of the Department of National Defense. For 21 years, he was director of aeronautical board, a position he held and confirmed by the Congress of the Philippines up to 1952. Considered expert in the Field, he was chosen to be the technical editor of Aviation Monthly and at various times, he worked as vice chairman and acting chairman of the National Science Development Board, where a number of Science projects were impetus. Dr. Zara was probably the most productive of Filipino inventors, with 30 devices and equipment patented to his name. Among these were the earth induction compass, used by pilots for direction; the vapor chamber, used to visualize radioactive elements; the wooden microscope; solar energy devices for areas not reached by power lines; a functional robot; the photo-phone, which allowed audiovisual phone conversations; a functional alcohol-fueled plane; wooden aircraft propellers; and a corresponding propeller cutting machine. He also has written numerous papers and textbooks in science and physics, with some even written in French. While busy in governmensty positions, Zara also was an educator. He was an instructor of aeronautics at the Valeriano Aviation School, at the American Far Eastern School of Aviation (1933) and at the Far Eastern University (1937‚Äì41). At FEATI University, he was professor of aeronautics (1946), then head of the Aeronautical Engineering Department (1962) and later dean of Engineering and Technology and director of research. He was elected executive vice-president of the university from 1946 to 1962 and acting president in 1956. He retired from government service in 1946 and joined the Far Eastern Air Transport Incorporated (FEATI) and eventually became a member of its board of trustees. He was also a Member of the board of directors of the National Shipyards and Steel Corporation and of the Civil Aeronautics Board.  Inventions, re-designs and theories  The Filipino scientist Gregorio Y. Zara (D.Sc. Physics) invented, made improvements to, or discovered the following: *The Zara Effect ‚Äì He discovered the physical law of electrical kinetic resistance called the Zara effect (around 1930) *He improved methods of producing solar energy including creating new designs for a solar water heater (SolarSorber); *A sun stove, and a solar battery (1960s); *Invented a propeller-cutting machine (1952); *He designed a microscope with a collapsible stage; *helped design the robot Marex X-10; *Invented the two-way television telephone or videophone (1955) patented as a \\"photo phone signal separator network\\"; *Invented an airplane engine that ran on plain alcohol as fuel (1952);  Contributions  He traveled extensively through the United States, Asia, and Europe to conduct investigative surveys. His research works and technical papers were published not only in the Philippines but in Europe as well. His books, L‚Äôetude du compass, Magnitique e induction, and his article, ‚ÄúL‚Äôetude seismologique de 1‚Äô0 de secondaire,‚Äù were published in Paris, France in 1930. His locally published research works were ‚ÄúDevelopment of Commercial Aviation in the Philippines,‚Äù ‚ÄúPrediction of Airplane Performance at a Glance,‚Äù ‚ÄúCommercial Aviation in the Philippines‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Technical Aspect of the Arais & Calvo Manila-Madrid Flight,‚Äù ‚ÄúPhoto elastic Stress Determination,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Propeller-Cutting Machine,‚Äù and ‚ÄúIndustrial Alcohol as Aircraft Fuel.‚Äù fatsss He has a total of 30 devices and equipment patented to his name. Namely: earth induction compass, used by pilots for direction; the vapor chamber, used to visualize radioactive elements; the wooden microscope; solar energy devices for areas not reached by power lines; a functional robot; the photo-phone, which allowed audiovisual phone conversations; a functional alcohol-fueled plane; wooden aircraft propellers; and a corresponding propeller cutting machine. Dr. Zara became internationally known for his scientific inventions. His magnetic and induction compass was awarded the ‚ÄúBrevet d‚Äô invention\\" by the Ministre de Industrie of the Kingdom of Belgium. His invention of the semi-automatic propeller making machine and the first aircraft engine using industrial alcohol as fuel drew admiration from aviation circles throughout the world. The other products of his inventive genius included the ‚Äúsolar-sorber,‚Äù which makes use of solar power for ordinary household needs, and the two-way ‚Äútelevision-telephone,‚Äù a device that permits a caller to see the picture of the party being called, and vice versa.  Local Awards  Gregorio Y. Zara was much honored by his countrymen. He was presented diplomas of merit by the Business Writers Association of the Philippines (1951), the Philippine International Fair (1952) and by the Society of Filipino Inventors (1955). He received meritorious citations as the ‚ÄúPropeller Maker of the Year‚Äù (1952) and the ‚ÄúAeronautical Engineer of the Year‚Äù (1953) by the Civil Aeronautics Administration. A Presidential Diploma of Merit and Distinguished Service Medal in 1959 for his pioneering works and achievements in solar energy, aeronautics and television; Presidential Gold Medal and Diploma of Honor for Science and Research in 1966; and Cultural Heritage award for Science Education and Aero Engineering, 1966. In 1978 he was conferred the Order of National Scientist by former President Ferdinand Marcos. On October 15, 1978, at the age of 76, Dr. Zara died of heart failure.

The organisation has a Secretary General and a President. Since 2005, they have been supported by Plan ADO. In 2000, the CPE was involved in a cheating scandal at the 2000 Summer Paralympics. History The CPE was created in 1995 in response to the success of Spanish competitors at the 1992 Summer Paralympics. Organizaci√≥n Nacional de Ciegos Espa√±oles (ONCE) assisted in setting up the CPE. In 1998, the Spanish government changed the laws, which impacted the status of the CPE to recognise it as equal to that of the Spanish Olympic Committee. At the same time, the organisation was received legal status, \\"declaraci√≥n de utilidad p√∫blica\\", as being useful to the general public. Governance and funding The organisation is a non- profit, and is set up and taxed in the same manner as the Spanish Olympic Committee. Income by the CPE are not subject 40% tax levied by the national government on admission fees for organisations except in the cases of sporting events. The CPE includes the five Spanish disability sport federations, which represent over 13,000 sportspeople, to host and govern disability sport on the local level around the country. They are the Federaci√≥n Espa√±ola de Deportes para Ciegos (FEDC), Federaci√≥n Espa√±ola de Deportes de Personas con Discapacidad F√≠sica (FEDDF), Federaci√≥n Espa√±ola de Deportes para Discapacitados Intelectuales (FEDDI), Federaci√≥n Espa√±ola de Deportes para Sordos (FEDS) and Federaci√≥n Espa√±ola de Deportes de Paral√≠ticos Cerebrales (FEDPC). Since 2005, as a result of Plan ADO, the CPE received additional institutional and financial support from companies and businesses in sponsoring athletes, events, federations and teams. Between 2005 and 2008, including in Plan ADO brought in an additional 17.5 million Euros to support preparations for the Spanish Paralympic team delegations at the 2006 Winter Paralympics, 2008 Summer Paralympics and 2010 Winter Paralympics. The funds directly benefited 390 competitors and 135 technical support personnel like coaches. The CPE manages the allocation of the Plan ADO funding to athletes and others. In 2013, CPE Secretary General Miguel Segarra accompanied the Madrid 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Bid Delegation to Bonn to submit the city's bid for the Games. Board members Past members of the board include Fernando Vicente Martin, who was the Committee's Vice President in the late 1990s. The President was in 2008 and 2009 Miguel Carballeda. Miguel Segarra was the Committee's Secretary General in 2008 and 2009, a role he continued to hold in 2013. Infanta Elena, Duchess of Lugo is the Honorary President of the Spanish Paralympic Committee. In this role she has led the Spanish delegation at the 2008 Summer Paralympics. Scandal Following the 2000 Summer Paralympics, Fernando Vicente Martin was expelled from the board of the Committee because they found him to be the one of the biggest participants in fraudulent activities involving the Spanish delegation at the Games, following an investigation initiated in November 2000 at the behest of the International Paralympic Committee. The Committee found that 10 of the 12 members of the Spanish intellectually disabled basketball team did no meet the standards for such players. The Committee also ordered members of the ID basketball team to return the gold medal they won at the 2000 Games.

After leaving Glasgow, Scotland with a consignment of coal for Limerick city on 27 December 1894, the ship ran into difficulty somewhere near Kilkee and foundered due to the heavy gales reported along the west coast of Ireland in late December of that year. This was confirmed on 3 January 1895 when a section of a port bow marked \\"Glasgow\\" was picked up near Kilkee. Early years Built in 1885, the ship was a steel-made, steam-powered vessel used for both cargo and passenger services. At the time of launch the vessel was fitted with all modern appliances, including accommodation for 40 first-class passengers and room to carry cattle on the main deck and lower decks. In October 1892, while on a voyage from Glasgow to Cork with about 250 tons of goods, the ship developed a heavy list after meeting heavy storms and arrived in Cork harbour nearly keeling over. Collision with the Maggie On 29 December 1891, the Inishtrahull was involved in a collision with an Irish sailing vessel from Dublin named the Maggie. The collision occurred in the Irish Sea, just off the Kish Bank. It was found in an investigation afterwards that the fault laid squarely in the hands of the second officer of the Inishtrahull, who left the bridge without a competent officer in charge (a carpenter was left alone on the bridge). After the collision the second officer was suspended from duty for two years. As all the crew had been evacuated and the vessel was taking on water, the Maggie was believed to have sunk somewhere around the Kish Lighthouse around . Sinking Leaving Glasgow Port on the morning of 28 December 1894, the ship was scheduled to arrive in Limerick on 30 December. After being missing for six days it was assumed that due to the storms blowing on the 28th, the ship had taken shelter and wasn't in a position to telegraph its whereabouts. On 3 January 1895, however, a section of a port bow from a ship with a brass plate marked \\"Glasgow\\" was picked up by the Kilkee coastguards near the town and reported to the Receiver of Wrecks in Limerick. This was not proven to be from the missing ship until 8 January when The Clyde Shipping Company abandoned the search for the ship and released the names of those thought to be aboard, coming to 26 including the captain, Thomas Whip.

It has characterised the Spanish government's administration of the Gibraltar-Spain border as amounting to using the frontier as \\"a political weapon\\", pointing out that long border queues at the Spanish checkpoint affect \\"Spanish workers in Gibraltar, primarily\\". It has also complained that the Gibraltar government discriminates against Spanish workers by not topping-up their pensions in the same way as it does for native Gibraltarian workers, and claimed that 500 Spanish workers were laid off in the first half of 2012 as part of an \\"anti-Spanish policy\\".

Created in 2009, RMNB received local and national media attention when it was the first U.S. media outlet to cover the 2013 Russian meteor event in the city of Chelyabinsk, Russia. RMNB has been featured on Fox News DC and NPR Weekend Edition Sunday, and in The Atlantic. About RMNB is a fan-operated, credentialed, multinational hockey blog that covers the Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League, the Hershey Bears (the Capitals' American Hockey League affiliate), and their respective players. Created in 2009 by Ian Oland and Peter Hassett, RMNB's mission is to \\"make hockey as fun to read about as it is to watch\\". RMNB takes its name from current Capitals captain and Russian native, Alexander Ovechkin. In response to questions from the media about a potential injury after being hit with a puck, Ovechkin was quoted in 2006 stating, \\"I'm okay; Russian machine never breaks.\\" In February 2013, RMNB received local and national media attention when co-founder and writer Peter Hassett, with contributing writers Fedor Fedin and Ian Oland, published the first U.S. media report about the Russian meteor event. In November 2013, the Washington Capitals announced that RMNB would contribute segments to their Emmy-winning television show, Caps Red Line.

Former members Doug Johnson and Craig Brownstein wrote game previews and other articles. Oksana Zolotar later worked with the game night staff for the Washington Capitals. Notable coverage=2013 Russian meteor event= On February 14, 2013, Peter Hassett was contacted by Moscow correspondent Fedor Fedin about reports of an explosion in Chelyabinsk, Russia. The writers were following news about Chelyabinsk because it is the hometown of Capitals center Evgeny Kuznetsov. By gathering information from social media videos and Twitter, including an account from former NHL goalie Michael Garnett and other eyewitnesses, Fedin and Hassett discovered that a meteor had hit Chelyabinsk, and Hassett (with additional reporting by Fedin and Ian Oland) published the news on their blog. Following the story, Hassett was interviewed by Garance Franke-Ruta, a senior editor at The Atlantic. He confirmed that he published the article a little after 11:00 p.m. EST. Franke- Ruta wrote that The Associated Press did not break the news until 12:21 a.m. EST Friday, confirming that Hassett and RMNB were the first to report the story in the United States. After Franke-Ruta's story was published, other news outlets began to pick up the story. On Friday evening, Hassett was interviewed by Will Thomas of Fox News DC who also confirmed that RMNB was the first to report on the meteor. On Sunday morning February 17, 2013, Hassett and Gordon were interviewed by NPR's Weekend Edition Sunday host, Rachel Martin. On this broadcast Martin confirmed that RMNB was the first to break the story in the United States by \\"about an hour and a half\\". Though not affiliated with the Washington Capitals nor endorsed by them, the Capitals' owner, Ted Leonsis, congratulated RMNB for its coverage of the meteor event. =Michal Neuvirth translation controversy= In August 2012, Russian Machine Never Breaks published a translation of an interview given by Washington Capitals goaltender Michal Neuvirth to Franti≈°ek Suchan of iSportz.Cz. The interview contained controversial remarks about current teammate Braden Holtby, Capitals' captain Alexander Ovechkin, former teammate Alexander Semin, former coach Dale Hunter, and other Capitals players. The interview was picked up by hockey media in the United States and internationally. The following news outlets published all or parts of RMNB's translation: The Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capitals-insider/post/michal- neuvirth-alex-ovechkin-isnt-what-he-used-to- be/2012/08/21/9aebc9d2-eb95-11e1-a80b-9f898562d010_blog.html Sporting News,http://aol.sportingnews.com/nhl/story/2012-08-21/michal-neuvirth-tweaks- braden-holtby-alex-ovechkin-washington-capitals NBC Sports' ProHockey Talk,http://prohockeytalk.nbcsports.com/2012/08/21/michal-neuvirth-sounds-off- on-semin-ovechkin-and-dale-hunter/ NHL SportsNet,http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/2012/08/21/neuvirth_unleashed/ and Yahoo Sports.https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/capitals-goalie- michal-neuvirth-thinks-braden-holtby-weakest-025232112--nhl.html In response to the coverage, Michal Neuvirth conducted an interview with Washington Capitals senior writer Mike Vogel where he commented that \\"there was some misunderstanding. They changed my meaning a lot. I was talking about the boys in a good way. They translate to the way they want it. I feel like they got nothing to write about right now.\\" Neuvirth was also quoted by NHL News and Sportsnet, saying the interview was mistranslated. On August 21, 2012, RMNB responded to criticisms of their translation by publishing a clarification about the interview. Hassett wrote, \\"While we stand by the articles we published, we acknowledge that translation is as much an art as it is an academic skill.\\" He wrote that, \\"Neuvirth‚Äôs meaning may have been misconstrued.\\" However, in a post on August 30, 2012, RMNB announced that its team had hired a professional translation firm, TransPerfect, to objectively translate the Neuvirth interview. RMNB compared TransPerfect's translation and its own side by side. After review, RMNB stands by its translation as the writers felt the professional translation and their own were nearly identical in meaning and therefore accurate. =Tim Thomas \\"Obama\\" signs and masks= Leading into the Capitals 2011-12 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals matchup against the Boston Bruins, Hassett published an article discussing Tim Thomas's performance after he snubbed the U.S. president Barack Obama during the Bruins' Stanley Cup celebration at the White House. Via a chart, Hassett showed that as Obama's approval rating got stronger, Thomas's save percentage got weaker. Because of this, Oland also made Obama signs and masks to try and throw Thomas off his game. Many Capitals fans in game three printed the signs out and wore the masks, gaining the blog national attention. Hockey Night in Canada did a segment on the posts during their live coverage of the game, The Huffington Post wrote a story about it, and ESPN's Pardon the Interruption discussed the signs and masks the next day on its show. =Barack the Red campaign= The Barack the Red campaign is a petition by Capitals fans for former President Barack Obama to attend a Washington Capitals game. The campaign was started by Ian Oland, co-founder of Russian Machine Never Breaks. The Barack the Red website features an open letter to President Obama and a petition with a link to the Facebook page where supporters are asked to \\"like\\" the page to show support for the campaign. In 2011, Robert Gibbs, a senior campaign advisor for Barack Obama, was asked if President Obama were planning to attend a Washington Capitals game. The reporter, The Washington Posts Scott Wilson, referenced the Barack the Red campaign started by Oland. President Obama has not attended a Washington Capitals game. =2015 Winter Classic jerseys= On September 22, 2014, Russian Machine Never Breaks revealed images from inside DC's Nationals Park that suggested the Washington Capitals would be introducing a new logo for the 2015 NHL Winter Classic. The following day, RMNB was the first to post leaked images of the new Winter Classic jerseys prior to their official unveiling.

Popularly known as ‚ÄòBig Mike‚Äôas he stood over six-feet tall, he is remembered for scoring a hat-trick against Cameroon in a World Cup qualifier in Lusaka in 1985. Playing career Chabala first played as a forward for Zambian Division I side Mufulira Blackpool in 1977, alongside players like Alex Chola, John ‚ÄòFuso‚Äô Lengwe and Simon Kaushi. The following year, he moved to Ndola side Vitafoam United where he would stay for three years, helping to transform the side into a strong team. Vitafoam won the 1981 Independence Cup with a 2-1 victory over Strike Rovers in October 1981 but Chabala was not part of that success as he had left three months previously to join Nkana Red Devils of Kitwe. He was part of the Devils team that won their first ever league title in 1982 without losing a single match. In his time with Nkana, Chabala won 4 league titles, the Independence Cup and the Champion of Champions trophy. In 1985, Chabala got a call-up to the national team under Brightwell Banda and he made his debut against Zimbabwe in a friendly match in Bulawayo in February 1985 which Zambia lost 3-2. He scored his first goal for Zambia the following month when Zambia drew with Malawi 2-2 in Lusaka, which was a brilliant free-kick with 5 minutes remaining, to tie the game. After the match, Chabala said of the goal: ‚ÄúIt was a great goal. I don‚Äôt think that goalkeeper will ever forget it and I don‚Äôt know if I will ever score a goal like that again in my life.‚Äù He was called to the national team for a 1986 World Cup qualifier against Cameroon. The shock value was immense when Chabala was named in the starting line-up to face the reigning African champions on 4 April 1985 in Lusaka, as he had only appeared in two friendly matches prior to that crucial match. It turned out to be the most sensational competitive debut in Zambian football when he scored an 11-minute hat-trick to lead Zambia to a famous 4-1 victory.Chitafu, Victor ‚ÄúZambia clobber old tired lions‚Äù Times of Zambia, 8 April 1985, p.10 A 1-1 draw in the second leg in Yaound√© saw Zambia through to the next round where they were knocked out by Algeria.

His last goal for Zambia came in a 1-0 friendly win over Malawi in Blantyre which also turned out to be his last game. In 1986, Chabala was 9th in the France Football poll for the African Footballer of the Year which was won by Badou Zaki of Morocco. With the emergence of a young Kenneth Malitoli, Chabala found his opportunities limited so he moved to Zambian Premier League side Kalulushi Modern Stars in 1988 and later coached the team.

Public discussion of homosexuality in Indonesia has been inhibited by the fact that human sexuality in any form is rarely discussed or depicted openly. Traditional religious mores tend to disapprove of homosexuality and cross-dressing. In Indonesia, where religion plays a dominant role in society, and where almost 90 percent of the population are Muslim, homosexuality is not punishable by national law, but condemnation of homosexuality has been voiced by many religious leaders, not only Islamic. The national criminal code does not prohibit cross-dressing or adult, non-commercial and consensual homosexual conduct between consenting adults, although it does contain a higher age of consent for same-sex sexual conduct, and there are some reports that police have sometimes harassed gay or transgender people using vaguely worded public indecency laws. At the local level, gay or transgender Muslims can be fined or imprisoned under provincial laws against homosexuality and cross-dressing. Indonesia's northwesternmost province of Aceh for example, has a sharia-based anti-homosexuality law that punishes anyone caught having gay sex with 100 lashes. Beyond the national and provincial laws, overt violence against gay or transgender people, by civilians, is still rare. Generally, such violent intolerance is restricted to members of religious vigilant groups such as the radical Islamist groups. The general public is becoming more aware of existence of gay and transgender people through greater press and media content, but this has not necessarily led to greater tolerance. In particular, there have been more depictions and discussions of homosexuality in the Indonesian news media, also depictions of gay lifestyles in Indonesian television and films. Indonesia does have a reputation as being a relatively moderate and tolerant Muslim nation; however, the recent survey revealed that intolerance of minorities is growing, with the highest level of hostility directed at the gay and lesbian community. The Indonesian Survey Circle (LSI) found in its most recent poll conducted in 2012 that a staggering 80.6 percent of its sample population objected to having gays or lesbians as neighbors. The figure has jumped significantly from 64.7 percent in 2005. In recent years, LGBT people in Indonesia are facing growing hostility and intolerance. In early 2016, LGBT people and activists in Indonesia are facing fierce opposition and attacks of homophobia and hate speech, even launched by Indonesian authorities. Coming out to family and friends is seldom carried out by LGBT people in Indonesia, as they are more afraid of rejection and social backlash. Nevertheless, there are some rare examples of understanding and acceptance of the family of LGBT people. Public view In Indonesian culture sexuality in any form is considered taboo subject and often immediately judged as obscenity. Sexuality, let alone homosexuality, issues are considered a very private matter that must be confined only within bedrooms. In Indonesian culture the concept of malu (shame/embarrassment or 'losing face') is prevalent. Indonesian people are generally tolerant towards homosexuals but prefer not to talk about it because of the strong culture of malu in Indonesian society. Waria, the male to female cross dressers for a long time have played their parts in Indonesian culture. Numerous Indonesian traditional performances such as lenong and ketoprak often featuring transsexuals as an object of jest, humor and ridicule. While ludruk drama and lengger lanang dance performance featuring male cross dresser as female dancer. Even today, gay and transsexuals can be found performing in Indonesian television and entertainment industry. In Indonesian view, it is quite acceptable to have transsexual or cross dresser entertainers or public figures. It is usually considered as a funny thing, unless it were to happen in their own family where having effeminate sons are often considered as a disgrace to the family. Opposition to homosexuality Traditionally Indonesians are quite tolerant towards LGBT people, as long as they keep quiet and stay discreet about their private lives. However, this level of tolerance is not extended towards LGBT rights movements, which recently faces fierce condemnation launched by Indonesian authorities and extended to public sphere. The anti-LGBT rhetoric began in January 2016 when Higher Education Minister Muhammad Nasir said LGBT people should be barred from university campuses. The national broadcasting commission emphasize a policy banning TV and radio programs that make LGBT behavior appear \\"normal\\", saying this was to protect children and teenagers who are \\"susceptible to duplicating deviant LGBT behaviors\\". The Indonesia Psychiatric Association classified homosexuality, bisexuality and transgenderism as mental disorders. Some even went to conspiracy theory rhetoric; Defence Minister Ryamizard Ryacudu called the LGBT movement a \\"proxy war\\" to brainwash Indonesians, that received \\"foreign funding\\", while pointing out funds from United Nations organizations like UNAIDS or Western governments and foundations. There have been a few incidents of LGBT people being harassed. LGBT groups are now working to set up safehouses and draw up evacuation plans in case of need. In Yogyakarta, in February 2016, 23 LGBT activists were roughed up by police, who told local media they stopped them from holding a rally to avoid a clash with a hardline Muslim group holding an anti-LGBT protest nearby. In February 2016, the public discourse and debates on homosexuality and LGBT issues has intensified with the occurrence of high-profile cases of alleged homosexual misconducts, involving Indonesian celebrities. First, an accusation of sexual approach and harassment done by TV personality Indra Bekti upon several men. Followed by the case of dangdut singer Saiful Jamil, who has been named a suspect in a sexual assault involving an underage male fan. On the other hand, amids fierce hostilities, some officials have defended the LGBT community - including Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama and Security Affairs Minister Luhut Pandjaitan. \\"Whoever they are, wherever they work, he or she continues to be an Indonesian citizen. They have the right to be protected as well,\\" Pandjaitan said. History Because of the culture of shame attached to homosexuality, homosexual activity is rarely recorded in Indonesian history. Unlike in other Asian cultures such as Indian, Chinese or Japanese, homosexual erotica in paintings or sculptures are almost nonexistent in Indonesian arts. Homosexuality is almost never recorded nor depicted in Indonesian history. A rare exceptions is the 18th-century account of alleged homosexuality of Arya Purbaya, an official in Mataram court, although it is not clear whether it was actually based on truth or a vicious rumors to disgraced him. The Javanese book Serat Centhini composed and published circa 1814 in Surakarta, mentioned several account of bisexuality and homosexuality practice in Javanese society. Story in this book which took place circa 1630, mentions that one of the main character, Mas Cabolang and his attendants encountered homosexual couple the Jathilan dancers in Ponorogo region. Mas Cabolang and one of his handsome attendant encountered more sexual experience with women as well with the jathils men. There are also an incident where he and Nurwitri, one of his handsome and effeminate entourage, encountered a homosexual affair with the regent of Wirosobo. Although waria, male to female transgender performers and prostitutes have long played their role in Indonesian culture, the Indonesian gay men and lesbian women homosexual identity has only been recently identified, mainly through identification with their western counterparts through film, television, and media. Prior to Suharto's New Order regime local Indonesian culture of gay and lesbi did not exist. The gay and lesbian movement in Indonesia is one of the oldest and largest in Southeast Asia. Indonesian gay right activism began since 1982 when the first gay rights interest group was established in Indonesia. The \\"Lambda Indonesia\\" and other similar organizations arose in the late 1980s and 1990s. Today, some of the major LGBT associations in the nation include \\"Gaya Nusantara\\" and \\"Arus Pelangi\\". There are now over thirty LGBT groups in Indonesia.Indonesia: Gays Fight Sharia Laws , Doug Ireland] Yogyakarta, Indonesia, hosted a 2006 summit on LGBT rights that produced the Yogyakarta Principles on the Application of International Human Rights Law in Relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity.Yogyakarta Principles However, a summit in March 2010 in Surabaya was met with condemnation from the Indonesian Ulema Council and was disrupted by conservative protesters.Earth Times. Conservative Indonesian Muslims break up gay meeting. 26 March 2010 = Radicalization of law and practice since 2016 = Recently, Indonesian politicians and government officials made a series of gaycist comments, that ended in a series of rule proposals with clear anti-gay tenor. Several human rights organizations as the Human Rights Watch are concerned. Discriminatory police raids conducted against homosexual men can lead to an imprisonment of 15 years. In April 2017, in Aceh, a homosexual couple had consensual coitus in the privacy of their own. They face public flogging based on the Sharia (Islamic laws). This is against international anti-torture law. Increased police raids along with a changing political culture forced the closure of most of Jakarta's gay bars and clubs, the hub of gay life in Indonesia outside of Bali, and in 2017 the last operating gay club in Jakarta, Apollo, closed its doors. Traditions Although the subjects of homosexuality are considered as a shame and people often refuse to discuss it in public, some culture and traditions in Indonesia records same sex relationships and activities, or LGBT behaviors. =Bissu, Calabai and Calalai= The Bugis people of South Sulawesi divide their society into five separate genders. Two are analogous to cisgender male (oroan√©) and female (makkunrai), and the remaining three are bissu, calabai and calalai. A bissu refer to a person with all aspects of genders combined to form a whole. A calabai is a 'false woman', they are generally physically male but take on the role of a heterosexual female. On the other hand, calalai is a person who is assigned female at birth but takes on the roles of a heterosexual male in the society. Calabai shares similarities with, yet is not identical to, effeminate gay men and the kathoeys of Thailand, while calalai is quite similar to butch lesbians.http://www.insideindonesia.org/weekly-articles/sulawesis-fifth-gender =Warok and Gemblakan= Particular traditional homosexual relations are exemplified in the warok-gemblakan rituals of the East Javanese people. Waroks are Javanese local heroes or \\"strong men\\" that usually perform traditional arts such as the Reog Ponorogo. According to tradition, a warok is required to be abstinent and thus is prohibited to indulge and be involved in sexual relationships with women. However, a warok does not remain completely celibate as having sex with boys between the ages of eight and fifteen is permitted as a substitute. The boy lover in this ritualized relationship is called the gemblak. The gemblak is usually kept by the warok in his household with the full agreement of the boy's family, which included compensation. Later on in his life a warok could be married with a woman as his wife, but was also allowed to keep a gemblak as a lover on the side. The warok-gemblakan relationships were thus similar to the pederastic rituals and traditions common to ancient Greece. These traditional ritualized relationships remained especially prevalent in Ponorogo, where there are older warok who may still have gemblak lovers.D√©d√© Oetomo Talks on Reyog Ponorogo However, these older men have never identified as homosexuals, and neither have their young lovers. Today the warok-gemblakan practice is discouraged by local religious authorities, especially through public moral opposition. As a result modern- day Reog Ponorogo performances rarely feature gemblakan boys as performers taking on the role of Jatil horsemen. These traditional performance roles are now mostly played by girls. It is likely that today warok-gemblakan ritual relationships survive and are practiced, but are undertaken by far more secretive means. =Lengger lanang= Lengger lanang (Javanese for \\"male lengger dancer\\") is an effeminate male that dances the traditional lengger dance and performs the role as a woman. Lengger dance is the Banyumas' counterpart of Javanese ronggeng dance. According to local Banyumas tradition, it can be performed either by women or a man dressed and dancing as a woman. The behavior involved in the lengger lanang tradition is somewhat reminiscent of transsexuality and cross-dressing behavior. A male lengger dancer would wear traditional female Javanese dance attire, which includes konde (hair bun), kain batik, kemben (torso wrap) or kebaya, selendang (sash), kembang goyang hair jewelry, all in full make up, and they will dance as graceful and glamorous as a woman. According to Javanese beliefs, the lengger idhang (spirit) might be incarnated into a girl or a boy, which would make them a talented and famous lengger dancer. This belief is somewhat the remnant of Javanese Hindu-Buddhist legacy that believe in nitis (reincarnation) cycle. This belief is often used to explain why the effeminate boy is born that way. Just like their female lengger and ronggeng counterpart, a famous male lengger dancer would also become the local celebrity, as the object of admiration, affection, even coveted by men eager to court and date him. In the past, some rich and powerful men might recruit him as a mistress. Because of prevalent culture of shame regarding sexuality, any sexual encounters or emotional relations would be done in such discreet manner. =Papuan boy-inseminating rites= Ritualized \\"homosexuality\\" as a rite of passage transforming boys into adult men has been recorded among Melanesian people of New Guinea, such as the Sambia and Etoro people of Papua New Guinea. On the Indonesian side of New Guinea, similar rituals have been recorded as being practiced among the Kimam people in southern Papua province. Anthropologists and other experts report similar practices among other tribes. These practices are age- structured and center on young boys as rites of passage. According to certain beliefs common to these tribes, prepubescent boys are contaminated with female elements through breast feeding and continuous contact with mothers and other female family members. To avoid further female contamination, upon puberty young boys are taken from their mothers and sequestered in communal houses with other boys and unmarried men. These single-gender conditions permit boys to undertake male bonding activities and highly-structured rituals, introducing and preparing these boys into proper warrior norms. Thus to wash away female contamination in preparation to become brave warriors, young boys need to ingest semen, regarded among these tribes as the quintessential male essence. The act of ingestion itself takes the form of fellatio or anal intercourse. The inseminators are older members of the tribes, usually uncles, fathers or older brothers of the boys' future wives. The rituals are repeated as needed and cease when the boys reach adulthood, which occurs among these tribes when the boys begin to develop beards and are married off soon after puberty.  LGBT in Indonesia  In Indonesia, effeminate male homosexual or male-to-female transsexual are called banci, bencong or waria (Indonesian: wanita-pria lit: female-male). While lesbians are called lesbi or lines. A rather straight-acting gay male are rarely identified, but if discovered usually they are called homo or gay, while the male homosexual prostitutes are called kucing (lit: cat). Those terms; banci, bencong, kucing and homo does have derogatory meanings, except for waria, gay and lesbian that have gained neutral perception. Name calling and gay bashing usually occur during teenage years, but rarely involves physical abuse and is mainly verbal. Like in other countries, stereotype of homosexuals occurs quite commonly in Indonesia. Such as they usually took certain line of works such as beauty salon owner or worker, beauticians, make-up artist, to traveling cross-dresser ngamen (street musician) to lewd activities such as a transsexual prostitute. The less effeminate male homosexuals however, are hard to detect and often blend in society. In traditional Indonesian culture, when a boy or a girl reach puberty, the relations between teenage boys and girls are limited. Traditional mores ‚Äî especially in villages and rural area ‚Äî disapprove the teenage courtship, as they may lead to premarital sex. Traditional mores also frowned upon the mixing between unmarried women and men, as they could led to scandalous fornication. Male bonding and close friendship however, are encouraged. The homoerotic experiences or even homosexual incidents might take place within all male environment, such as asrama or pondok (boarding school, in both religious or secular schools), kost (monthly rent room usually for university students or workers), to military barrack and prison. There are some reports of homosexual incident within these places, however given the pervasive culture of shame, these incidents are often immediately covered as it might stained the reputation of those institutions. Waria, male to female transgender ritualists, performers and prostitutes, have long played a role in local Indonesian cultures, gay and lesbi did not exist as subject positions before the New Order period, when men and women came to recognise themselves in fleeting depictions of mostly foreign homosexuals and reached the conclusion that a 'gay world' could exist in Indonesia, too. For gay men, this world resides in sites ranging from parks to discos, spas and massage parlors to private residences, 'open' places where men seeking romance and companionship, as well as sex, can congregate at certain times of the day or night. The world of lesbi women, who socialise at home, is differently configured; heterogendered relationships predominate, with a new, waria-like category of persons known as tomboi or hunters (butch lesbian) pairing up with feminine women. The contrast between gays and lesbis reflects the juxtaposition of parallel cultural worlds: if gay men can congregate in parks - and even in their parents' households - relatively unnoticed and unimpeded, this is due in good part to their adherence to a nationally pervasive gender ideology that limits young women's movements, valorises male friendships and frowns upon social mixing between unmarried women and men. For quite some times, the waria or transsexuals has created a distinct sub-culture in Indonesian social fabrics. Often congregating in beauty salons and prevalent in Indonesian entertainment business, the waria's sub-culture has created their own language, the Bahasa Binan, that often influenced Indonesian hip dialects among youngsters. The pressure upon gay men or lesbian women often comes from their own family. With family pressure to get married there are mainly two alternatives ‚Äî either gays and lesbians decide to get married just to please the family or they run away from them. Another difference in homosexual life in Indonesia compared to their western counterparts is gays' and lesbis' commitment to heterosexual marriage; the vast majority of the gay men either planned to marry women or were married already. Legal rights The national criminal code does not prohibit private, non-commercial homosexual relations between consenting adults who have reached the age of eighteen years of age. A national bill to criminalize homosexuality, along with cohabitation, adultery and the practice of witchcraft, failed to be enacted in 2003 and no subsequent bill has been reintroduced.Indonesia Seeks to Imprison Gays , 365Gay.com, 30 September 2003 However, local governments have been given the option of passing local laws based on traditional Islamic morality. In 2002, the Indonesian Government gave Aceh province the right to introduce Islamic sharia laws which criminalizes homosexuality, albeit only to Muslim residents. In September 2014, Aceh had passed a sharia-based anti- homosexuality law that punishes anyone caught having gay sex with 100 lashes. The law has been enforced by the end of 2015. Indonesian same-sex couples and households headed by same-sex couples are not eligible for any of the legal protections available to opposite-sex married couples. The importance in Indonesia for social harmony leads to duties rather than rights to be emphasized, which means that human rights along with homosexual rights are very fragile. Yet, the LGBT community in Indonesia has steadily become more visible and politically active. Indonesian law does not criminalize homosexuality, if it done in private, non-commercial, and among consenting adults. However, Indonesian law does not recognize gay marriage, civil unions or domestic partnership benefits. Same-sex couples are not eligible to adopt a child in Indonesia. Only married couples consisting of a husband and a wife can adopt. Today, there is no law exists to protect Indonesia citizens from discrimination or harassment on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

It is the longest operating Hilton Hotel outside the United States. Designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and opened in 1955 as the Istanbul Hilton, it was the first modern hotel in Europe built from the ground up following World War II. Project Republic Day 1959 On December 19, 1950, Conrad N. Hilton revealed to the New York Times that he had recently reached an agreement with the Turkish Government to build a new Hilton hotel in Istanbul with 300 rooms costing US$5 million. The U.S. governmental agency Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA), which administered the Marshall Plan, the post-war aid program for Europe, was the main financier of an investment project totalling US$50 million in the whole of Europe. Hilton would bring up the operation capital and run the hotels while keeping one third of the profits. At the time, Istanbul was growing in tourism, economy and commerce, but lacked high- class accommodation sites except six luxury hotels (Park Hotel, Konak/Tokatlƒ±yan Hotel, Tarabya Konak Hotel, Pera Palace Hotel, Deniz Park Palace Hotel and Splendid Palace Hotel) as well as six first-class hotels (Continental Hotel, Bristol Hotel, Londra Hotel, √ñz ƒ∞pek Palace Hotel, √áƒ±nar Hotel and Akasya Hotel). The total number of rooms conforming to internationally acceptable comfort standards was 290. The project would more than double the city's accommodation capacity at the international level. John Wilson Houser, vice-president of Hilton International, wrote a letter to Conrad N. Hilton on June 23, 1951 about the Soviet Union's intention to build a 1,000-room hotel in Istanbul similar to the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City, plans of which he had seen. Hilton Istanbul Bosphorus project thus became a factor in the Cold War US‚ÄìSoviet rivalry. The final contract between the Turkish Government and Hilton Hotels was signed on August 9, 1951. The necessary land and US$3 million of the investment capital were provided by Emekli Sandƒ±ƒüƒ±, the Turkish Pension Fund, and the remaining US$2 million by the ECA. Hilton International secured the initial operating rights for 20 years. Architecture and construction Hilton Istanbul Bosphorus Hotel seen from south (2007) The hotel was designed by the renowned American architectural and engineering firm Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM), which was also carrying out some other urban planning and building projects in Turkey. Award-winning Turkish architect Sedat Hakkƒ± Eldem was appointed as an advisor. The Hilton Hotel was built upon the confiscated property of a former Armenian cemetery. The groundbreaking took place in the summer of 1952. German company Dyckerhoff, Widmann & Julius Berger was signed for the construction. The labor at the construction site was carried out by up to around 500 Turkish workers and engineers. Critical construction materials were imported. White Portland cement, glass and structural steel came from Germany, marble and ceramic fittings from Italy, and aluminum window castings, air-conditioning units and elevators from the United States. The eleven-story building, in the form of a rectangular prism with dimensions of , represents modern architecture. The building was erected on a green hillside with a panoramic view of the Bosphorus and is very close to the busy Taksim Square. The building is a combination of the modern lines of Gordon Bunshaft with the rich artistic and romantic elements of Ottoman and Turkish architecture, implemented by Sedat Hakkƒ± Eldem. As an example of Orientalism, the roof of the main entrance, designed by Eldem, resembles a flying carpet. The decorative tiles came from K√ºtahya, and the carpets for the rooms covering were woven in Konya by hand. After completing the construction work in a record time of 21 months, the hotel became the largest in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Entrance of Istanbul Hilton Hotel from Cumhuriyet Avenue. The hotel was temporarily opened on May 20, 1955. The official opening took place in a ceremony on June 10, 1955 in presence of Conrad N.

Ballast, other than cargo, may be placed in a vehicle, often a ship or the gondola of a balloon or airship, to provide stability. A compartment within a boat, ship, submarine, or other floating structure that holds water is called a ballast tank. Water should move in and out from the ballast tank to balance the ship. In a vessel that travels on the water, the ballast will remain below the water level, to counteract the effects of weight above the water level.Edward Spon, Oliver Byrne, Ernest Spon, Francis N. Spon, Spons' dictionary of engineering, civil, mechanical, military, and Naval, Volume 2 (1874), p. 1205. The ballast may be redistributed in the vessel or disposed of altogether to change its effects on the movement of the vessel. History The basic concept behind the ballast tank can be seen in many forms of aquatic life, such as the blowfish or members of the argonaut group of octopus.Discovery Blog: Scientists solve millennia-old mystery about the argonaut octopus The concept has been invented and reinvented many times by humans to serve a variety of purposes. In the fifteenth and sixteenth century, the ballast \\"did not consist entirely of leakage, but of urine, vomit, and various foul food leavings that lazy sailors discharged into the ballast contrary to orders, in the belief that the pumps would take care of it.\\" In the nineteenth century, cargo boats returning from Europe to North America would carry quarried stone as ballast, contributing to the architectural heritage of some east coast cities (for example Montreal), where this stone was used in building. Uses One of the functions of a yacht's keel is to provide ballast. Ballast takes many forms. The simplest form of ballast used in small day sailers is so-called \\"live ballast\\", or the weight of the crew. By sitting on the windward side of the hull, the heeling moment must lift the weight of the crew. On more advanced racing boats, a wire harness called a trapeze is used to allow the crew to hang completely over the side of the hull without falling out; this provides much larger amounts of righting moment due to the larger leverage of the crew's weight, but can be dangerous if the wind suddenly dies, as the sudden loss of heeling moment can dump the crew in the water. On larger modern vessels, the keel is made of or filled with a high density material, such as concrete, iron, or lead. By placing the weight as low as possible (often in a large bulb at the bottom of the keel) the maximum righting moment can be extracted from the given mass. Traditional forms of ballast carried inside the hull were stones or sand. Sailing ballast is used in sailboats to provide moment to resist the lateral forces on the sail. Insufficiently ballasted boats will tend to tip, or heel, excessively in high winds. Too much heel may result in the boat capsizing. If a sailing vessel should need to voyage without cargo then ballast of little or no value would be loaded to keep the vessel upright. Some or all of this ballast would then be discarded when cargo was loaded. Ballast weight is also added to a race car to alter its performance. In most racing series, cars have a minimum allowable weight. Often, the actual weight of the car is lower, so ballast is used to bring it up to the minimum. The advantage is that the ballast can be positioned to affect the car's handling by changing its load distribution. This is near- universal in Formula 1. It is also common in other racing series that ballast may only be located in certain positions on the car. In some racing series, for example the British Touring Car Championship, ballast is used as a handicap, the leading drivers at the end of one race being given more ballast for the next race. Ballast may also be carried aboard an aircraft. For example, in gliding it may be used to increase speed and/or adjust the aircraft's center of gravity, or in a balloon as a buoyancy compensator.  In commercial shipping  If a cargo vessel (such as a tanker, bulk carrier or container ship) wishes to travel empty or partially empty to collect a cargo, it must travel in ballast. This keeps the vessel in trim, and keeps the propeller and rudder submerged. Typically, being \\"in ballast\\" will mean flooding the ballast tanks with sea water. Serious problems arise when the ballast water is discharged, as water-borne organisms may create havoc when deposited in new environments.  In railways  Some kinds of railway track incorporate ballast. Other kinds of track have no ballast Tubular Modular Track References Mechanisms (engineering) Watercraft components ","title":"Ballast"},{"id":"38544299","text":"Colonel William Willoughby Cole Verner (22 October 1852 ‚Äì 25 January 1922) was a British soldier, writer and ornithologist and inventor of a type of compass.

Life Verner was born in 1852 and he showed an early interest in bones owning the fossils of extinct animals. By 1867 he had started his own diary recording his interest in egg collecting and shooting. In 1874 he joined the Rifle Brigade and was posted to Gibraltar although he also holidayed on the Scottish island of Tiree with fellow naturalist Howard Irby where they continued their interest in studying, shooting (and eating) the local wildlife.

Verner had been told of the cave that had been discovered by a Spanish farmer called Jos√© Bull√≥n in 1905 who was looking for bat guano. Bull√≥n had found human remains and markings on the walls, but assumed that they were made by the Moors. Verner had himself lowered into the cave and later reported his findings in the London-based Saturday Review.Cuerva de la Pieta, accessed 20 January 2013 Verner wrote a number of weekly reports for the Review which factually described the cave, although Verner accounted for the drawings of extinct animals by assuming that they had been sketched a result of observing the fossil bones that were there. It was these reports that brought Breuil to Spain with Hugo Obermaier, Paul Wernert and the Spaniard Juan Cabre Aquilo. Breuil stayed in Spain for two months studying the cave paintings whilst funded by the Prince of Monaco. Verner later co-authored a scientific paper with Breuil and Obermaier on Cueva de la Pileta. Verner wrote History and Campaigns of the Rifle Brigade in 1912. In 1917 Breuil returned and he and Verner were warned off their next investigation of Devil's Tower Cave in Gibraltar by a local policeman (but not before they had retrieved some Neanderthal tools). Their final visit to the cave was in 1919 and they were convinced that this was another home to early man like the earlier finds at Cuerva de la Pieta and at Forbes' Quarry Cave, Gibraltar 1 had been found over fifty years earlier. Their confidence was confirmed when Gibraltar 2 was found nearby in the early 1920s by Dorothy Garrod who had come to investigate at Breuil's encouragement.

Its headquarters are at the Biblioteca Crist√≥bal Delgado (Library Christopher Delgado), located on Salvador Allende Street. There are two branches, including one in the Saladillo neighborhood, Biblioteca El Saladillo, and another in the La Granja neighborhood, Biblioteca P√©rez Petinto. In addition to its book collection and reference materials, the institution offers a variety of cultural activities such as a book club. The library is run by the municipality. It was established in 1925 by the local historian Manuel P√©rez-Petinto y Costa. History The city's first public library was established on the ground floor of City Hall at the initiative of the city historian, Manuel P√©rez- Petinto and Costa, on August 12, 1925.Delgado G√≥mez, Crist√≥bal (1990). Algeciras, pasado y presente de la ciudad de la bella bah√≠a. Graficasal. p.163. During the 1940s, the Postal Service moved into the building, which caused the library to moved to the county fair hall of Algeciras. In 1959, refurbishments at the fair grounds and urbanization of Avenida Francisco Franco (now Fuerzas Armadas) forced the library to relocate to the headquarters of the Society for the Promotion of Algeciras building on the same street.Delgado G√≥mez, Crist√≥bal (2003). Algeciras en Blanco y Negro. Fundaci√≥n Municipal de Cultura Jos√© Luis Cano. p.72. . Subsequent to the death of Juan P√©rez Arriete (d. 1961), the local chronicler, the library came under the management of the city historian, Crist√≥bal Delgado G√≥mez, in 1963. He moved the library in the following year to a new building in Calle Salvador Allende. The building was remodeled and expanded through the mid-1990s, doubling the study areas, expanding the capacity by almost 10,000 volumes, and the addition of a new hall. At the initiative of then Mayor Patricio Gonzalez Gomez, the building was renamed on April 25, 1995, as the Library Christopher Delgado.Delgado G√≥mez, Crist√≥bal (2004). Memorias de un algecire√±o. FMC Jos√© Luis Cano. p.204. In 2010, the City Council moved forward with a project to build a new library on the grounds of the former barracks next to the Escuela de Artes y Oficios de Algeciras; its design was awarded to the municipal architect Pedro Martinez Perez-Blanco. In addition to the library, the new building will house the notary files and the municipal historical archive.

Common and scientific names of aquatic invertebrates of the United States and Canada. American Fisheries Society Special Publication 26 Description The white-glossy shell grows to a height of 6.9 mm. The small shell has a conoidal shape. The whorls are tumid. The base is flattened. The whole surface is faintly marked with remote spiral threads, and very faintly scratched with closer microscopic striae. The whorlz are bluntly angulated in the middle, and the last is so, besides, at the base below the periphery. This angulation meets the outer lip. The second and third whorls have two or three strong spiral threads. There are very many close unequal oblique lines of growth. Of these, the strongest rise in close-set infra-sutural puckerings, which on the third whorl resemble small beads. There is a glossy, thin ivory-white calcareous coat over a brilliant pearly white layer. The spire is high and fine-pointed. The apex is blunt, the smooth rounded 1¬Ω whorl is scarcely projecting. There are six tumid whorls increasing rapidly. The penultimate whorl rises swollen out of the suture. The base of the shell is a little flattened. The suture is linear, not impressed, a little coarse, slightly marginated by the overlap of the succeeding on the preceding whorl and the slight tumidity caused by the infra-sutural puckerings. The round aperture is very oblique, with a soft pearly nacre all round. The outer lip is very slightly descending, thick, and bevelled outwards to a sharp edge. There is a broad thin hyaline pad spread over the body that connects the outer lip and the columella, which is broad, thick, shallowly excavated, with a slight external median horizontal tooth or ridge. The edge is reverted and closely appressed. The thin, calcareous operculum is small. It is flat, convex on the inside, where it shows 7¬Ω whorls. The body whorl begins suddenly to enlarge close to its end.G.W.

The small, globose shell is very solid and imperforate. The spire is conic, more or less depressed. The suture is moderately impressed. There are five whorls. These are slightly convex, the last decidedly deflected toward the aperture, encircled by about fifteen subequal spiral lirae, separated by interstices about as wide as the ridges. The incremental striae are generally strongly developed, causing the liree to appear nodose or somewhat irregular, and the interstices to appear pitted. The oblique aperture is pearly white within.

He has published three books: Essential Chan Buddhism, Chan Heart, Chan Mind and Falling is Flying: The Dharma of Facing Adversity together with Ajahn Brahm. Education Before and after his ordination, he earned degrees in various fields of study. He has a diploma in biotechnology from Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Singapore.http://www.buddhistfellowship.or.id/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=168:guo- jun-fashi&catid;=34:artikel-dhamma&Itemid;=85 He also earned his degree in Buddhist philosophy from Fu Yan Buddhist Institute, Taiwan, Bachelor of Arts in Psychology and Sociology from Monash University, Australia, and Master of Buddhist Studies from University of Sydney, Australia. Life and religious training Guo Jun started practicing meditation intensely in 1997. He studied various traditions of Buddhist practice, from Tibetan Buddhism, Theravada Buddhism, and also Mahayana tradition, including Ch'an Buddhism under the guidance of Sheng-yen. He entered solitary retreat in 1999 in Korea at Hwa Gye Sa Buddhist Monastery and Song Kwang Sa Buddhist Monastery. After learning under personal tutelage of Sheng-yen from Dharma Drum Mountain, Taipei, Taiwan, he got Inka Shomei (verification of attainmentÔºèÂç∞ÂèØËØÅÊòé). In 2005 he received lineage transmission as the 58th generation Dharma heir of Linji Chan school and 53rd generation Dharma heir of Caodong Chan School of Chinese Buddhism. He also got Inka Shomei from Qinying from Fuhui Monastery, Taipei, Taiwan and received transmission as the 42nd generation of Dharma heir of Xianshou Huayan and Cien East Asian YogƒÅcƒÅra schools of Chinese Buddhism. On the 28th of August 2013, Hsing Yun, the founder of Fo Guang Shan, held the passing of doctrines ceremony for the 69 from the second generation of disciples at Tathagata Hall and Guo Jun was one of them. He is a member of Australian Psychological Society. He is also a spiritual and guiding teacher of Chan Community Canada, and Dharmajala Indonesia. He was the abbot of Dharma Drum Retreat Center in Pine Bush, New York from 2005 to 2008. He was the abbot of Mahabodhi Temple in Singapore until 2017. In February 2017, Guo Jun stepped down as abbot of the Mahabodhi Monastery and now the president of the monastery's management committee. Jing Yao replaced him as the abbott, witnessed by senior monks from various countries. Controversies=Court cases= Businessman Lee Boon Teow, who was also a trustee of the Mahabodhi Monastery and former vice-president of its management committee, has filed three lawsuits against Guo Jun. The two were in a dispute over the ownership of a Buddhist sculpture valued around over $1 million. Lee Boon Teow has sued the monk for defamation over a series of group chat messages that the former abbot had shared with other management committee members, where Guo Jun had allegedly implied that Lee's company was in financial difficulties and questioned if his cancer relapse was affecting his judgement and decision- making. Lee claimed that Guo Jun discredited him as he had uncovered the monk's alleged impropriety. Guo Jun countersued Lee, claiming ownership of the sculpture and asked for its return. The sculpture was returned to Guo Jun in December 2017. On 24 October 2017, a settlement was reached over the defamation lawsuit, with Guo Jun offering to pay $30,000 to Lee Boon Teow to settle the case, without admitting to any defamation or guilt. In November 2017, Lee sued Guo for return of A$240,000 which Lee had given Guo to study for a doctorate in Australia. Guo did not pursue the studies but used part of the money to buy property in Australia, which was subsequently sold for a profit. Guo believed that the money had been given to him as a gift for his own use, in a Buddhist practice known as dana. The court dismissed that Lee did not have a case against Guo. =Financial management= During the court proceedings for the lawsuits faced, Guo disclosed that he has at least A$3 million in assets in 2009, and that he has a \\"different interpretation\\" of Buddhist concepts of austerity; he believes he should manage his own financial assets and expenditure, without disclosing them to the monastery or its management committee. =CPIB report= Lee had also filed a Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) report against Guo. Guo in an email interview with Lianhe Zaobao, replied that he had not been summoned by the police over the report. =Guo's press statement= In October 2017, Guo released a statement that in the past few years, he had been smeared and falsely accused which caused harm to the Mahabodhi Monastery and Buddhism and apologised for it. In order to protect the reputation, he had spent time and money to safeguard the reputation. In view of that, he would not respond to any rumors anymore.

Overview Polanyi argued that the term economics has two meanings: the formal meaning refers to economics as the logic of rational action and decision-making, as rational choice between the alternative uses of limited (scarce) means. The second, substantive meaning, however, presupposes neither rational decision-making nor conditions of scarcity. It simply refers to the study of how humans make a living from their social and natural environment. A society's livelihood strategy is seen as an adaptation to its environment and material conditions, a process which may or may not involve utility maximisation. The substantive meaning of economics is seen in the broader sense of provisioning. Economics is simply the way society meets their material needs. Anthropologists embraced the substantivist position as empirically oriented as it did not impose western cultural assumptions on other societies where they might not be warranted. The formalist vs. substantivist debate was not between anthropologists and economists, however, but a disciplinary debate largely confined to the journal Research in Economic Anthropology. In many ways, it reflects the common debates between etic and emic explanations as defined by Marvin Harris in cultural anthropology of the period. The principal proponents of the substantivist model were George Dalton and Paul Bohannan. Formalists such as Raymond Firth and Harold K. Schneider asserted that the neoclassical model of economics could be applied to any society if appropriate modifications are made, arguing that its principles have universal validity.  The formalist position The formalist model is closely linked to neoclassical economics, defining economics as the study of utility maximization under conditions of scarcity. All societies are therefore a collection of \\"choice making individuals whose every action involves conscious or unconscious selections among alternative means to alternative ends\\" or culturally defined goals. (Burling, 1962, quoted from Prattis, 1982:207). Goals refer not only to economic value or financial gain but to anything that is valued by the individual, be it leisure, solidarity or prestige. Since a formalist model usually states what is to be maximized in terms of preferences, which often but not necessarily include culturally expressed value goals, it is deemed to be sufficiently abstract to explain human behavior in any context. A traditional assumption many formalists borrow from neoclassical economics is that the individual will make rational choices based on full information, or information that is incomplete in a specific way, in order to maximize whatever that individual considers being of value. While preferences may vary or change, and information about choices may or may not be complete, the principles of economising and maximising still apply. The role of the anthropologist may then be to analyse each culture in regards to its culturally appropriate means of attaining culturally recognized and valued goals. Individual preferences may differ from culturally recognized goals, and under economic rationality assumptions individual decisions are guided by individual preferences in an environment constrained by culture, including the preferences of others. Such an analysis should uncover the culturally specific principles that underlie the rational decision-making process. In this way, economic theory has been applied by anthropologists to societies without price-regulating markets (e.g. Firth, 1961; Laughlin, 1973). The substantivist position Non-market subsistence farming in New Mexico: household provisioning or 'economic' activity? Polanyi's term, \\"the great transformation,\\" refers to the divide between modern, market-dominated societies and non-Western, non-capitalist pre-industrial societies. Polanyi argues that only the substantive meaning of economics is appropriate for analysing the latter. According to Polanyi, in modern capitalist economies the concepts of formalism and substantivism coincide since people organise their livelihoods based on the principle of rational choice. However, in non- Capitalist, pre-industrial economies this assumption does not hold. Unlike their Western capitalist counterparts, their livelihoods are not based on market exchange but on redistribution and reciprocity. Reciprocity is defined as the mutual exchange of goods or services as part of long-term relationships. Redistribution implies the existence of a strong political centre such as kinship-based leadership, which receives and then redistributes subsistence goods according to culturally specific principles. In societies that are not market-based, reciprocity and redistribution usually occur together. Conversely, market exchange is seen as the dominant mode of integration in modern industrial societies, while reciprocity may continue in family and inter-household relations, and some redistribution is undertaken by the state or by charitable institutions. Each of these three systems of distribution requires a separate set of analytical concepts. Without a system of price-making markets formal economic analysis does not apply, as for example, in centrally planned economies or preindustrial societies. Economic decision-making in such places is not so much based on individual choice, but rather on social relationships, cultural values, moral concerns, politics, religion or the fear instilled by authoritarian leadership. Production in most peasant and tribal societies is for the producers, also called 'production for use' or subsistence production, as opposed to 'production for exchange' which has profit maximisation as its chief aim. These types differ so radically that no single theory can describe them all. This difference in types of economy is explained by the 'embeddedness' of economic (i.e. provisioning) activities in other social institutions such as kinship in non-market economies. Rather than being a separate and distinct sphere, the economy is embedded in both economic and non-economic institutions. Exchange takes place within and is regulated by society rather than being located in a social vacuum. For example, religion and government can be just as important to economics as economic institutions themselves. Socio-cultural obligations, norms and values play a significant role in people's livelihood strategies. Consequently, any analysis of economics as an analytically distinct entity isolated from its socio-cultural and political context is flawed from the outset. A substantivist analysis of economics will therefore focus on the study of the various social institutions on which people's livelihoods are based. The market is only one amongst many institutions that determine the nature of economic transactions. Polanyi's central argument is that institutions are the primary organisers of economic processes. The substantive economy is an \\"instituted process of interaction between man and his environment, which results in a continuous supply of want satisfying material means\\" (1968:126). Course of the debate Critics of the formalist position question its central assumptions, in particular that the universality of rational choice and utility maximization can be assumed across all cultures, including its reductionism to explain even modern Western economies. Prattis noted that the premise of utility maximization is tautological; whatever a person does, may it be work or leisure, is declared to be utility maximization, a premise that can never be contradicted or disproven. If he or she does not maximize money then it must be pleasure or some other value. To quote: \\"This post hoc reasoning back to a priori assumptions has minimal scientific value as it is not readily subject to falsification.\\" (1989:212). For example, a person may sacrifice their own time, finances, or even health to help others. Formalists would then pronounce that they do so because they value helping others, and so sacrifice other goals in order to maximize this value (e.g. meaning, satisfaction of having helped, approval from others etc.), even though it contradicts formalists usual dictum of profit maximization. Similarly, Gudeman argued that Western economic anthropologists will invariably find the people they study behave \\"rationally\\" since that is what their model leads them to do. Conversely, formalism will consider any behavior that does not maximize utility based on available means as irrational even though such \\"non-maximising acts\\" may seem perfectly rational and logical to the individual whose actions may have been motivated by a completely different set of meanings and understandings. Finally, there is the substantivist point that both economic institutions and individual economic activities are embedded in social and cultural institutions and can therefore not be analysed in isolation. Social relationships play an essential role in people's livelihood strategies; consequently, a narrow focus on atomised individual behavior to the exclusion of his or her socio-cultural context is bound to be flawed. Substantivism has also had its critics. Prattis (1982) argued that the strict distinction between primitive and modern economies in substantivism is problematic. He implies that substantivism focuses on social structures at the expense of analyzing individual agency. Non-maximizing adaptation strategies occur in all societies, not just in \\"primitive\\" ones. Similarly, Plattner (1989) argues that generalization across different societies is still possible, meaning that Western and non-Western economics are not entirely different. In an age of globalization there are no \\"pure\\" preindustrial societies left. Conditions of resource scarcity exist everywhere in the world. Anthropological fieldwork has demonstrated rational behavior and complex economic choices amongst peasants (cf. Plattner, 1989:15). For example, individuals in communist societies can still engage in rational utility maximizing behavior by building relationships to bureaucrats who control distribution, or by using small plots of land in their garden to supplement official food rations. Cook observed that there are significant conceptual problems with substantivists‚Äô theories: \\"They define economics as an aspect of everything that provisions society but nothing that provisions society is defined as economic.\\" (1973:809).Cook, S. (1973). \\"Economic anthropology: problems in theory, method, and analysis\\". Handbook of social and cultural anthropology: 795-860.

It consisted of 1,120 personnel, of which 65 were officers. The Army was not ready for the deployment of aviation forces to Europe, and it became necessary to prepare after President Woodrow Wilson's declaration of war. Overview Aerial Gunnery and Armament School Newspaper Saint-Jean-de-Monts The Fly Paper - 18 November 1918 Locations of major Air Service, United States Army stations in France, 1918 As part of the buildup of US forces, aviation units were formed into aero squadrons primarily at Kelly Field, San Antonio, Texas, with additional units being formed at Rockwell Field, San Diego, California. Once formed, and prior to their deployment to Europe, Camp Taliaferro, north of Fort Worth, Texas, and several airfields near Toronto, Ontario, Canada were used by the British Royal Flying Corps (RFC) to perform flight training for the new aero squadrons. Camp Hancock, near Augusta, Georgia, was used for training service squadrons of aircraft mechanics as well as flight training. When ordered to deploy, units departed though Garden City, New York, which was the primary port of embarkment. Units there were loaded onto transport ships for the trans-Atlantic crossing. Upon arrival in Europe, Liverpool, England, and Brest, France, were the primary ports of disembarkation, although other ports were also used. Some aero squadrons arriving in England received additional training from the Royal Flying Corps, and later the Royal Air Force (RAF) once it was established, and were then attached to British squadrons, deploying with them to France. Others received further training and were sent to Winchester, Hampshire, where they awaited their cross-channel transfer to France, using the port of Southampton. After deployment to France, Air Service Replacement Concentration Barracks in St. Maixent was the primary reception center for new aero squadrons assigned to the American Expeditionary Force (AEF). There, units were classified as pursuit, bombardment or as observation units. Once processed, units were sent to one of several Air Instructional Centers (AIC) where they received additional training, then/or to the First Corps Observation Group School on Amanty Aerodrome or to the First Pursuit Organization and Training Center on Villeneuve-les-Vertus Aerodrome. 8th Aero Squadron (Observation), Saizerais Aerodrome, France, 11 November 1918 After assignment, the Air Service's deployed units operated from grass aerodromes, at first using airfields already built by the French \\"A√©ronautique Militaire\\", then from new aerodromes purposely built for the American forces. The exact location of many of these aerodromes is no longer certain as many archives have since disappeared, and as the facilities were only temporary, most of the traces have long vanished through ploughing. After the Armistice came into effect in November 1918, the wartime Air Service was demobilized. This process was completed within a year and the National Defense Act of 1920 then established the United States Army Air Service on a permanent basis, with several new units being formed. Later, some of the temporary wartime units were consolidated to retain the lineage and honors of their wartime service with the AEF. Stations Below is a list of the barracks and aerodromes used by the American Expeditionary Force that were sent to France during World War I. Most of the headquarters and command services used barracks or requisitioned properties not linked with flying grounds, yet some where installed on airfields as in Souilly, Saizerais or in Toul, where the \\"Gengoult\\" barracks had been built by the French \\"Aeronautique Militaire\\" on the northern edge of the Croix de Metz airfields (misspelt for \\"Gengault\\"). =American sector=Command and control * Headquarters, Air Service, AEF, Chaumont, Champagne-Ardenne * First Army Air Service : Organized at: La Fert√©-sous-Jouarre, √éle-de-France, 10 August 1918 : Moved to: Ligny-en-Barrois, Lorraine, 25 August 1918 : Moved to: Souilly, Lorraine, 21 September ‚Äì 11 November 1918 * Second Army Air Service : Organized at: Toul, Lorraine, 12 October ‚Äì 11 November 1918 * Third Army Air Service : Organized at: Ligny-en-Barrois, Lorraine, 14 November 1918 : Moved to: Longuyon, Lorraine, 22 November 1918 : Moved to Germany.

Originally from Henan province, Chen was among the first batch of students to graduate university after the resumption of Gaokao examinations in 1978. Chen worked up the ranks in the party bureaucracy in his home province from a minor local official to the deputy provincial party chief. In 2009, he became Governor of Hebei. Then in 2011, he became the party secretary (the top official) of the Tibet Autonomous Region, developing the region economically and instituting greater policing surveillance.

He has since then attracted press for overseeing \\"re- education camps\\" targeting Turkic minorities in the region. Early life and education Chen Quanguo is a native of Pingyu County, Henan province. In December 1973, at the age of 18, Chen enlisted in the People's Liberation Army where he served as part of an artillery division for four years. He joined the Communist Party of China in February 1976. After leaving the military in March 1977, he briefly worked at a car parts factory in Zhumadian. After China resumed the National Higher Education Entrance Examination which was interrupted during the Cultural Revolution, in March 1978 Chen was admitted to the Economics Department of Zhengzhou University in the provincial capital Zhengzhou. Career=Henan= Chen Quanguo graduated from Zhengzhou University in December 1981 and returned to work in his hometown of Pingyu, Henan. Starting in 1983 he worked for the prefectural government of Zhumadian, and in 1988 became the Communist Party Secretary of Suiping, a county under the administration of Zhumadian. In 1994, he was appointed the head of the Organization Department of the nearby prefecture-level city of Pingdingshan. From 1995 to 1997 Chen enrolled as a part-time student at the School of Business Administration of Wuhan University of Technology, obtaining a master's degree in economics. From 1996 to 1998 he served as the Mayor and Deputy Party Secretary of Luohe, another prefecture-level city in Henan. Chen Quanguo was promoted to Vice-Governor of Henan Province in January 1998, and worked in the administration of then Henan Governor Li Keqiang. Chen was regarded as a close confidante of Li. In November 2000 Chen was appointed by the CPC head of the Standing committee of the Henan Provincial committee in the provincial Organization Department. In April 2003 he became the Deputy Communist Party Secretary, President of the Party School of the CPC, and the President of the Henan Institute of Administration. =Hebei= In November 2009, Chen Quanguo was transferred to neighboring Hebei and promoted to Acting Governor and Deputy Party Secretary of the province. He replaced Hu Chunhua, who became the Party Secretary of Inner Mongolia. In January 2010 he was officially elected by the provincial congress as Governor of Hebei at the third session of the 11th National People's Congress. =Tibet= On August 25, 2011, the CPC Central Committee announced the appointment of Chen of the remote Tibet Autonomous Region as Party Secretary, the top official of the region. On May 8, 2012, Chen Quanguo was elected the first secretary of the party committee of the Tibet Military Region. Shortly after taking up his position in August 2011, the region under Chen advertised positions for 2,500 additional police,From Tibet to Xinjiang Beijing's Man for restive regions Chen Quanguo is the prime target of US sanctions, (13 December 2019), https://tibet.net/from-tibet-to-xinjiang-beijings-man-for-restive-regions- chen-quanguo-is-the-prime-target-of-us-sanctions/ and Chen implemented a new security policy for Tibet in the form of \\"convenience police stations\\" (). This divided urban centers into grids, allowing the authorities to systematically observe all activities within the area. As of early 2016, at least 156 of the concrete one- and two-story stations were built in Lhasa, with guards on 24 hour \\"seamless\\" surveillance patrols, while two stations are only 15 meters apart.Party boss Chen Quanguo replicating his Tibet policy in Xinjiang, (13 December 2016), https://www.tibetanreview.net/party-boss-chen- quanguo-replicating-his-tibet-policy-in-xinjiang/ At least 544 more of these police stations exist throughout urban centers across Tibet. Chen instituted the \\"double-linked household management system\\" to surveil 81,140 households in the Tibetan Autonomous Region, comprising more than three million people mobilized for security and social issues. The system is described as a method where neighbors spy on each other, and as an Orwellian social system where family members are encouraged to report on each other to authorities.Kelsang Dolma, Tibet Was China‚Äôs First Laboratory of Repression, (31 August 2020), https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/08/31/tibet-china-repression-xinjiang- sinicization/ Chen Quanguo's preferred method of repression is to divide up agitated regions with a grid system and pit them against each other in the name of counter-terrorism. There have been suspicious incidents in Tibet, pointing towards Quanguo's silencing methods like the blast at a government building in Tibet's Chamdo prefecture. ‚ÄòFree Tibet‚Äô fliers were found at the scene.Tenzin Wangchuk, Agence France-Presse, (27 Octobre 2011), \\"The Tibetan news portal www.TibetExpress.net also reported the news, saying \\"Tibet's independence\\" had been daubed in red on the damaged walls of the office building and \\"Free Tibet\\" fliers had been found at the scene. \\"No one is accused or arrested in this connection so far but the entire road access leading to and from Chamdo had been completely cut off including closure of Karma monastery\\", Tibet government-in-exile's Central Tibetan Administration leader Lobsang Sangay states, \\"If you protest in Tibet, more often than not you get arrested, or beaten up, sometimes tortured, sometimes you disappear, sometimes you die\\".

In Tibet, 156 monks, nuns, and ordinary people self-immolated between 2009 and 2019. According to the International Campaign for Tibet (ICT),Self-immolation fact sheet, (02 December 2019), https://savetibet.org/tibetan-self- immolations/ cited by Outside online, \\"Chinese police have beaten, shot, isolated, and disappeared self-immolators who survived.\\"Tracy Ross, Tibet is still burning, (24 September 2019), https://www.outsideonline.com/2402414/self-immolation-tibet#close Often, the self-immolators carry pictures of the 14th Dalai Lama and/or make long life prayers for the Dalai Lama. These immolations were widely seen to be a form of extreme protest against the Chinese government's crackdown on Buddhists from the region,Resistance in Tibet: Self-immolation and Protest. International Tibet Network, 03 May 2013. and as an offering by the self-immolators of their bodies to show the world how badly Tibet is suffering. The Dalai Lama blames the self-immolations on Chinese policies, and said, \\"Some kind of policy, some kind of cultural genocide is taking place\\". Later in December 2013, Chen issued a statement included in a Human Rights Watch report as, \\"We have followed the law in striking out and relentlessly pounding at illegal organizations and key figures, and resolutely followed the law in striking at the illegal organizations and key figures who follow the 14th Dalai Lama clique in carrying out separatist, infiltration, and sabotage activities, knocking out the hidden dangers and soil for undermining Tibet‚Äôs stability, and effectively safeguarding the state‚Äôs utmost interests [and] society‚Äôs overall interests.\\" In 2015 during Chen's tenure, a transfer of 280,000 Han Chinese settlers to Tibet's capital Lhasa was authorized, as part of China's urbanization plans. The Central Tibetan Administration states 7.5 million Han Chinese and 6 million Tibetans live in the region, as of 2015, and adds, \\"Under the guise of the economic and social development, Beijing encourages its population to migrate to Tibet with the clear aim to marginalize Tibetans from the economic, educational, political and social life of the region\\". During Chen's tenure, Tibet's ethnic majority has been swamped by promoting economic development that encourages migration from elsewhere in China.In Xinjiang, China applies repressive lessons learned in Tibet, (12 December 2019), https://www.economist.com/china/2019/12/12/in-xinjiang-china-applies- repressive-lessons-learned-in-tibet In September 2011, at least 226 \\"key projects\\" for the development of Tibet were awarded to Han Chinese owned companies.Beijing sends a new flood of Han migrants to Lhasa: Tibetans risk disappearing, (27 January 2015), http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Beijing-sends- a-new-flood-of-Han-migrants-to-Lhasa:-Tibetans-risk-disappearing-33294.html Only Han Chinese college graduates in Tibet or Tibetans that speak fluent Mandrarin secure well-paid private sector jobs.Adrian Zenz, \\"Full Employment\\" in Tibet: The Beginning and End of Chen Quanguo‚Äôs Neo-Socialist Experiment, (26 February 2018), https://jamestown.org/program/full-employment-tibet- beginning-end-chen-quanguos-neo-socialist-experiment/ Chinese data shows that Tibet's GDP grew by 11.8% in 2012. The growth rate in 2013 was 12.1%. The growth rate in 2014 was 12%, ranking first in the country. The growth rate in 2015 was 11%, and the region's GDP exceeded 100 billion CNY for the first time. In the first half of 2016, Tibet led other provinces and cities in China at a growth rate of 10.6%. =Xinjiang= On 29 August 2016, Chen became the Communist Party Secretary of Xinjiang, replacing Zhang Chunxian. He was considered as the best fit for this as he has been successful in controlling Tibet in the past. to one million Uighurs have been held involuntarily in detention camps meant to ‚Äòre-educate‚Äô and provide ‚Äòvocational training‚Äô to the large Turkic-Muslim population in the Xinjiang region. His measures of disciplining them include: mass-engineering of the Muslim population through detainment camps, specialized boarding schools for Uighur children, arbitrary arrests. His regime has apparently ‚Äúdestroyed 1,588 terrorist groups‚Äù and ‚Äúarrested 12,995 terrorists‚Äù since 2014. Upon taking office in Xinjiang, Chen became the first senior official in the history of the People's Republic to have occupied the top posts of both Xinjiang and Tibet. It signaled that Chen was a promising candidate for the 19th Politburo of the Communist Party of China, to be installed in the autumn of 2017, as the party chief position in Xinjiang ordinarily held a seat on the Politburo. He concurrently served as the first secretary and political commissar of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Party Committee. Chen is a member of the 19th Politburo of the Communist Party of China, elected in 2017. He was previously an alternate member of the 17th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and a full member of the 18th Central Committee.  Counter-terrorism and detention camps  After Chen took office, he issued a written military order to Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, and put forward the slogan: \\"In Xinjiang, if there is no stability then all our efforts are for nothing.\\" () He has expanded counter-terrorism and anti- separatist efforts under orders from Xi. There have been no reported terrorist attacks in Xinjiang since 2017. According to Ming Pao, Chen's measures to maintain stability in Xinjiang have been affirmed by the top level of the Communist Party of China. Chen has overseen the construction of a network of internment camps. Chen expanded the detention camps in Xinjiang holding Muslim ethnic minorities. As a party boss for the region, Chen exhorted local officials to \\"round up everyone who should be rounded up.\\" When the local officials who feared it would exacerbate ethnic tensions and stifle economic growth pushed back, Chen responded by purging them including one county leader who was jailed after quietly releasing thousands of inmates from the camps. The recent US Customs seize which included alleged human hair is said to be linked back to the forced labor and atrocities at the Uighur detention camps. This seize is said to have hurt Quanguo both financially and emotionally as the Uighur projects were his brainchild. Aside from camps, Chen has also increased surveillance of residents by using advanced technology as well as increasing police presence. Under Chen, a policy of \\"Pair-up and become family\\" is used to surveil households, many of which include men detained at the re-education camps. The wives of camp detainees must share a bed with the officials during an average 6-day stay.Alexandra Ma, China is reportedly sending men to sleep in the same beds as Uighur Muslim women while their husbands are in prison camps, (04 November 2019), https://www.businessinsider.de/international/china-uighur-monitor-home-shared- bed-report-2019-11/?r=US&IR;=T As Xinjiang Party Secretary, Chen promoted the recruitment of the local population into the police force. The Uighurs have been put under a surveillance system that is able to detect facial features and clothing and accessories to distinguish them from the other ethnic and religious groups in the region. This information is pooled into a central database and aides the government to crackdown on any escapees from the detainment centres.  Economic development  Chen Quanguo continued to introduce policies such as economic development, employment protection, housing projects, infrastructure improvement, and ecological protection, increasing the GDP of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region from 752.9 billion CNY in 2012 to 1.09 trillion CNY in 2017, with an average annual growth of 9%. Infrastructure investment totaled 1.94 trillion CNY, with an average annual growth rate of 27.5%, forest coverage rate increased from 4.24% to 4.87%, and oasis forest coverage rate increased from 23% to 28%.  Personal life = Family = Chen has a daughter who attended a school in U.K. while he was the governor of Hebei. = Personality = The South China Morning Post has said that Chen is known for not putting jokes, slogans or personal anecdotes in official speeches. It also noted that he preferred to stay in the background during press meetings.  US Sanctions  On 9 July 2020, the United States government imposed Global Magnitsky Act sanctions and visa restrictions against Chen Quanguo, together with Zhu Hailun, (ÁéãÊòéÂ±±) and Huo Liujun (). With sanctions, he and his immediate relatives are barred from entering the US and will have US-based assets frozen.

The Beyens family in Nazareth  The name Beyens is frequently found in Nazareth, in Deinze and more generally in the Ghent area. In the early seventeenth century people named Beyens belonged to the notable personalities of the area. Livinus Beyens was mayor of Nazareth in 1625.Frans De Potter en Jan Broeckaert, Geschiedenis van de gemeenten der Provincie Oost-Vlaenderen, Gent, 1864‚Äì1870, deel V, p. 45. In the first quarter of the 18th century, Franciscus Beyens, born in Nazareth on 7 August 1691, married Josine (Judoca) Van Acker. Franciscus was the son of Paulus Beyens, born in Nazareth 29 October 1659, and of Joanna Vermeersch and the grandson of Laurentius Beyens, born in Nazareth on 28 March 1630This proven filiation takes away all possibility of a descendance from a Jacques-Fran√ßois Beyens, born in the Walloon part of Brabant and belonging to the ancient family of Van Beyens de Grambais. and Petronella Wouters. The couple Beyens-Van Acker went on living in Wontergem near Deinze and had five children: * Petrus Beyens (born 21 January 1721) * Jean-Fran√ßois Beyens (born 18 January 1723) * Joseph Beyens (born 5 January 1725) * Jacobus Beyens (born 15 February 1727) * Petrus-Franciscus Beyens (born 16 February 1731) There is uncertainty about the profession of Beyens- Van Acker, but most probably he was a (gentleman?)-farmer on the farm named Ter Linden.K.

She was a daughter of Egide Camberlyn, holder of the seigniory of Amougies and of Marie-Jeanne Amelot, and a sister of Egide Guillaume Camberlyn who was town clark in Ghent. Beyens took up the profession of notary in Deinze (1751‚Äì1794). He became alderman of Deinze (1777‚Äì1784) and mayor (1788‚Äì1792). The couple had five girls and five boys: * Marie-Th√©r√®se (1754‚Äì1782) * Carola (1756, died young) * Jan-Baptist-Hubert (1757 ‚Äì before 1766) * Constant (1758‚Äì1808) * Albert (1760‚Äì1827) * Isabelle (1760 ‚Äì before 1767) * Eug√®ne- Frans (1762‚Äì1793) * Rosalie (1764‚Äì c. 1796) * Jean-Baptiste-Justin (1766‚Äì1829) * Isabelle (1767 ‚Äì c. 1803)This second Isabelle, not the first, married with Jean-Baptiste Gheldolf The four sons who reached adult life studied at the University of Louvain.

After his law studies in Louvain, he joined the notaryoffice of his father. In 1790 he became an active Patriot and participated in the fights against the Austrian troops. In 1791 he became known as a rich and popular lawyer and notary, ready to adopt the revolutionary ideas. After the first French invasion he became, on 11 December 1792, a member of the city council of Deinze. After the second and more durable invasion of June 1794 he became secretary of the district authority, also remaining a notary. From 1797 on he was again member of the city council of Deinze. In April 1800 he was appointed 'sous-pr√©fet' in Oudenaarde.Not 'pr√©fet' as Poplimont called him wrongly. In 1803 he became, along with two of his brothers, a member of the lodge Les Amis Philantropes in Brussel. His reputation was perhaps not untainted. A confidential report for Napoleon mentioned him as 'the only sous-pr√©fet unfavourably reported'. He died in Gent at the house of his brother Albert, as a result, so it was reported, of a blood vomit. = Albert Guillaume Marie Beyens = Albert Guillaume Marie Beyens (Deinze, 8 November 1760 ‚Äì Brussels, 7 November 1827), who had a twin sister, Isabelle Beyens (who died before 1767), was the second living son of Pierre-Fran√ßois Beyens . For his studies at the University of Louvain at the college called The Falcon, he was by mistake registered as coming from Courtrai. After obtaining his degree in law, he in 1787 became a lawyer in Ghent. He modestly took part in the political life of the town and in 1792 he was appointed as an alderman. He wrote three juridic treaties, preserved in handwriting: * Commentaire sur la Coutume d'Alost * Notulen op de Costuymen van Gent * Reflexiones ad Consuetudines Gandavenses. Remaining a lawyer during the following years, he was 39 when in 1800 he married the young Suzanne Mouriau (1778‚Äì1814). The same year he was appointed president of the court in Ghent (1800‚Äì1810). He was very favourably evaluated in official reports. Prefect Faipoult wrote: Learned, intelligent, knowledgeable of the Flemish jurisprudence and the commissioner of the government wrote: there is no judge capable of replacing him. In 1803 he became a member of the lodge 'Les Amis Philantropes' in Brussels. In 1808he was made a lecturer at the newly founded 'Ecole sp√©ciale de droit'. He possessed an extensive library, of which the librarian De Goesin published an inventory in five volumes. The attorney-general Frans Jozef Beyts wrote about him (and this at a time when Beyens had fallen in disfavour: I attended some of his sessions at the tribunal. Nothing surpassed his skill, his easy way of solving problems, his accurate views. His honesty is recognized, he identifies himself with the Codes of justice procedure, he studies them and applicates them with passion, from morning till night, he is a man of extraordinary talents. 1809 became for him a dramatic year. In order to finance his purchases of nationalized property he had signed bills of exchange in favour of the banker Josse Bernard Goethals. When the banker was declared bankrupt, Beyens was dragged along. Not only did his creditors claim their due, but Goethals had also made forged bills with the signature of Beyens. Although he was a magistrate and not a merchant, He was also declared bankrupt. His enemies published pamphlets accusing him of all sorts of misconduct. His situation became untenable and he had to resign. He was however helped by the government and given a post as lecturer at the Law School in Amsterdam. There he found time to write two juridic treaties (also remained unpublished): * Projet d'une loi relative √† la proc√©dure civile (1811) * Projet de code pour le royaume de Hollande (1812) In 1817, having lost in Amsterdam his wife and one of his two daughters, he came back to the Southern Netherlands. He established himself as a lawyer in Brussels and soon acquired a favorable reputation, especially where actions against the king and the government were involved. = Eug√®ne-Frans Beyens = Eug√®ne-Frans Beyens (Deinze 25 May 1762 ‚Äì Ghent 10 October 1793) acquired the degree of doctor in theology at Louvain and on 8 September 1787 he was ordained as a priest. He died in his early thirties. = Jean-Baptiste Justin Beyens = Jean-Baptiste Justin Beyens (Deinze, 5 June 1766 ‚Äì Brussels, 1 November 1829) was the ninth child of the couple Beyens-Camberlyn. He studied in Louvain with excellent results.Poplimont tells that in 1787 he came out in first place at the 'Concours g√©n√©ral'. It is more exact to say that he was second in the Concursus Philosophicus on 9 August 1787, after the primus Van der Vrecken, as was mentioned on his birth certificate: hic fuit anno 1787 in promotione generali secundus lovaniensis. In 1791 he became a lawyer in Ghent. When the French conquered Flanders, he began travelling to Amsterdam and Hamburg. Upon his return, he was appointed as public prosecutor in Ghent and was also made a member of the city council. In 1798, following the hardening of the Directoire, he was dismissed. In 1797 he was also made a lecturer at the Ecole centrale of the Scheldt department. But the dictatorial hardliner and commissioner Gr√©goire Du Bosch called him an enemy of the people and dismissed him. But in July 1799 the tide turned and Du Bosch was permanently banned from the political life in Ghent. Beyens had won, but he didn't enjoy it for long, because he moved to Brussels, where he became a lawyer and advocate. As his two brothers he became a member of the lodge 'Les Amis Philanthropes' and contrary to them he remained an active member during many years. In 1814 he married with Isabelle Fonteyne (1792-). As a lawyer, often in association with his brother, he defended citizens defying the authorities. A few of his notable cases were:: * on behalve of the administrators of the Alms houses in Ghent against count Vilain XIIII for amounts still due by his father Philippe Vilain XIIII. * Th√©r√®se Dons de Lovendeghem against her father Louis-Ferdinand Dons de Lovendeghem * the reverend Leon de Foere, publisher of 'Le Spectateur Belge' * Charles Van der Straeten, author of 'De l'√©tat actuel du Royaume des Pays-Bas et des moyens de l'am√©liorer' (1819) * the reverend vicars Ambrosius Goethals and Frans Martens, jailed for four years. Jean- Baptiste Beyens died a few months before the Belgian revolution began. He was later seen as one of the forerunners and in the Biographie Nationale he and his brother are described as, with their energy and talents having prepared the Belgian revolution of 1830. His daughter Hortense married the well known Dutch general Hubert Joseph Jean Lambert de Stuers. His son Eug√®ne chose entirely for the new Belgian kingdom. Eug√®ne Beyens Baron Eug√®ne Beyens (1816‚Äì1894), Belgian ambassador in Paris Napoleon-Eug√®ne Beyens (1855‚Äì1934) Minister of State, Minister of Foreign Affairs Eug√®ne Beyens (Brussels, 12 November 1816 ‚Äì Presle, 17 July 1894) was a Belgian diplomat. He married in Madrid on 29 June 1851 with Maria de las Mercedes Alcala Galiano y Valencia (Madrid 1828 ‚Äì Paris 1917), daughter of the count of Casa Valencia. He was one of the first diplomats of the kingdom of Belgium. After peace was made with the Netherlands, he became a diplomat in The Hague and in Madrid. In 1850 he was at the Belgian legacy in Coburg and in 1853 he was appointed at the embassy in Paris. He was appointed as ambassador in 1864 and remained in Paris until his dead. His wife was a friend of the empress Eug√©nie, wife of the emperor Napoleon III. On 26 November 1850, while he was secretary at the embassy in Coburg, duke Ernst II of Saksen-Coburg and Gotha bestowed upon him a title of baron ('Freiherr'), hereditary for all his descendants. This bestowal had no legal ground in Belgium. On 15 July 1851 status and title were however confirmed within the Belgian nobility. Napol√©on-Eug√®ne Beyens Napoleon-Eug√®ne Beyens (Paris, 24 March 1855 ‚Äì Brussels, 3 January 1934), son of ambassador Eug√®ne Beyens, married with Marguerite Oppenheim (1871‚Äì1949), daughter of a banker in Frankfurt. After having worked with his father from 1877 on, he was sent to Madrid for a year, then became a secretary of king Leopold II, rejoined his father in Paris and became 'charg√© d'affaires' during his illness.

First, serving on the St. Louis County planning commission, then as a St. Louis County Councilman for almost 4 terms, He was also a financial consultant, and Republican politician from Missouri. He grew up in Shrewsbury, Missouri, attended Webster Groves High School and the University of Missouri - Columbia. He served in the Air Force from 1954 until 1958. He started an Insurance brokerage with his older brother, Doug Milford. H.C. Milford died on April 30, 2018, at the age of 86. Political career Milford became St. Louis County Executive on October 25, 1989 when Gene McNary, serving his fourth term in the position was appointed Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service by President George H.W. Bush. As county executive, Milford proposed that St. Louis International Airport be run by an independent authority, rather than the City of St. Louis. Little more than a year into his role as county executive, Milford decided to stand for re-election in November 1990. He was defeated by the Democratic nominee, Buzz Westfall, by a margin of 55%-45%. This defeat ended 28 years of Republican control of the government of St. Louis County, and, as of 2018, made Milford the last Republican to lead the county. Redevelopment career Following his defeat, Milford volunteered to serve as economic development director, and financial consultant for economically depressed East St. Louis, Illinois. Working with newly elected East St. Louis mayor Gordon Bush, Milford lent credibility to several re- development projects and thus helped to attract wary investors to the city. Of the re-development projects he was involved in, the most visible is the Casino Queen, a riverboat casino on the East St. Louis waterfront of the Mississippi River, and at the time of its construction, a sorely needed source of revenue for the city. Milford continued to work to improve East St. Louis until at least 2003, commuting there from his home in Webster Groves, Missouri.

An effective soldier who held a number of senior commands, he was held responsible for the looting that followed the Battle of C√°diz in 1702 which severely damaged the Habsburg cause in the War of the Spanish Succession. He was dismissed from the army in 1703 and while later reinstated, never held active command again He sat as Member of Parliament for a number of constituencies and was Governor of Berwick-upon- Tweed from 1713-1715. He died in London on 14 December 1717. Life Biddick Hall; Sir Henry's birthplace was demolished and replaced by this in 1701 Henry Belasyse was born in 1648, at Biddick House in Durham, son of Sir Richard Belasyse (1612-1651) of Potto, North Yorkshire, and his second wife, Margaret (d. after 1670), daughter of Sir William Lambton. He had an elder half brother from Sir Richard's first marriage, William, who died in 1681 and a sister Catherine. The Belasyse were a prolific and long-established Durham family; his paternal grandfather, Sir William, was High Sheriff of Durham from 1625-1640. Many of his relatives were Catholics who backed Charles I of England in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, including Viscount Fauconberg (1577-1653) and Lord John Belasyse (1614-1689). His maternal grandfather, Sir William Lambton, was also a Royalist, killed at the Battle of Marston Moor in 1644. Sir Richard himself seems to have favoured Parliament and unlike his relatives, emerged from the wars with his estates largely intact. Henry was educated at the Kepyer school in Houghton-le-Spring and after graduating from Christ's College, Cambridge in 1667, trained as a lawyer in the Middle Temple. However, in 1674 he changed careers and raised a company of men for the Scots Brigade, a mercenary unit in the Dutch States Army; in the absence of a professional standing army, this was a common choice for English or Scots gentry who wanted to pursue a military career. In 1680, he married Dorothy Benson, a widow and mother of the politician Robert Benson, Baron Bingley; they had three children, Mary, Thomas and Elizabeth, none of whom survived to adulthood. After Dorothy's death, he married Fleetwood Shuttleworth (1676-1732); they had two children, Margaret, who died young and William (1697-1769). Career Battle of Saint-Denis (1678); Henry was wounded during this inconclusive battle The Scots Brigade was a mercenary unit in the service of the Dutch Republic, whose origins went back to the 1580s; despite the name, by 1672 this normally contained three Scots and three English regiments. The latter were withdrawn when England allied with France in the 1672-1678 Franco- Dutch War but restored after the 1674 Treaty of Westminster ended their involvement. By 1674, the remaining regiments had lost much of their national identity and a deliberate policy was adopted to re-establish them as English and Scottish units. Henry raised a company for one of the restored English regiments, which eventually became the 6th Foot or the Royal Warwickshire Regiment. Fighting between the Dutch and French continued; Henry fought at Cassel in 1677 and shortly after he replaced Thomas Ashley as Colonel of the regiment. He was wounded at Saint-Denis in 1678, the final battle in the Franco-Dutch War and knighted at some point between 1678 and 1681. William sent the Brigade to England in 1685 to help James II suppress the Monmouth Rebellion, although it returned in August without seeing action. In early 1688, James demanded the repatriation of the entire Brigade; William refused to comply but used the opportunity to remove officers of doubtful loyalty. For reasons that are unclear, Sir Henry returned to England in April and replaced as Colonel by Philip Babington. Sir Henry's relative, the Catholic Stuart loyalist Lord John Belasyse (1614-1689) as a young man in 1636 These events may have been connected, as Sir Henry had family links to the Stuart regime; in 1686, Lord John Belasyse was appointed to the Privy Council of England, despite the Test Act that officially barred Catholics from public office. In June 1688, his Protestant third wife Lady Anne refuted allegations that James' heir James Francis Edward Stuart was smuggled into Mary of Modena's bedchamber. However, Robert Benson, the first husband of Sir Henry's wife Dorothy, had been a close associate of Lord Danbury, moderate Tory and signatory of the Invitation to William, asking him to assume the English throne. William landed at Torbay on 5 November 1688 and on 22nd, Sir Henry was part of a force under Danby that secured York, the most important city in Northern England, then Hull, its largest port. The outcome was his promotion to Brigadier General in April 1689; in September, he became Colonel of a Regiment of Foot, originally raised by the Duke of Norfolk. In this period, regiments were treated as the personal property of their Colonel, changed names when transferred and disbanded as soon as possible. Richard Leveson, a then common practice, despite attempts to ban it. As 'Belasyse's Regiment of Foot,' the unit took part in the 1689-1691 Williamite War in Ireland under Frederick Schomberg and fought at The Boyne (1690), Aughrim (1691) and the Siege of Limerick in August 1691. When the town of Galway surrendered on 26 July, Sir Henry was appointed military governor and awarded estates in County Kerry confiscated from their previous Jacobite owners. He was also elected in 1692 as MP for Galway Borough in the Parliament of Ireland, although he was on active service in Flanders during his tenure. When on leave in London in early 1691, Sir Henry was badly injured in a duel with Colonel Richard Leveson, allegedly over an incident in Ireland. While duelling was common in this period, Marlborough described Sir Henry as 'not loved but has good sense and is a good officer.' Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt, who also served in Ireland, later referred to him as 'mediocre and avaricious' but Sir Henry was consistently promoted by William, who was generally reluctant to have English officers in senior commands, regarding them as less trustworthy or competent than the Dutch or Germans. With the war in Ireland at an end, Henry was given command of a brigade in Flanders; at the Battle of Landen in 1693, he and Thomas Tollemache managed to extract the defeated Allied infantry in good order. In October 1694, he was promoted to Lieutenant-General and his brigade was part of Vaud√©mont's screening force during the 1695 Allied siege of Namur. The French commander Villeroy achieved superiority over Vaud√©mont of 90,000 men to 37,000 but their attack on 14 July failed to break his line, allowing the Allies to conduct an orderly withdrawal while Henry helped cover their retreat. After the fall of Namur, he supervised the court-martial of officers who had surrendered Diksmuide and Deinze in July 1695; Ellenberg, commander at Diksmuide, was executed while eight others were dismissed or 'cashiered.' He remained in the Netherlands until the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick brought the Nine Years' War to an end. Battle of Cadiz (1702). The Treaty left unresolved the question of who would succeed the ailing and childless Charles II of Spain, an issue that had dominated European politics for over 30 years; Ryswick was viewed by all sides as being simply a pause in hostilities. Despite this, the Tory majority in Parliament was determined to reduce costs and by 1699, the English military had been cut to less than 7,000 men. England, Ireland and Scotland were then separate entities with their own Parliaments and funding; to mitigate these cuts, William transferred a number of regiments onto the Irish military establishment, one being Belasyse's Regiment of Foot. In 1693, Sir Henry purchased the estate of Owton in County Durham from his nephew Richard. He was elected Member of Parliament for the nearby constituency of Morpeth in 1695 with support from the Whigs; after 1699, he moved towards the Tories and switched to the City of Durham in 1701. He held this seat until 1712, then between 1713-1715 sat for the rotten borough of Mitchell, in Cornwall. Brancepeth Castle; purchased by Sir Henry in 1701 Just before the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession in July 1701, Sir Henry's unit was assigned to Jamaica, a notoriously unhealthy posting and he exchanged regiments with William Selwyn, taking over as Colonel of the Queen Dowager's Regiment, later 2nd Foot. Selwyn died in Jamaica in April 1702. Sir Henry was appointed second-in-command to the Duke of Ormonde, commander of the Anglo- Dutch force sent to Spain in 1702 to support the Habsburg candidate, Archduke Charles. He and Major-General Charles O'Hara commanded the force that successfully seized Port St Mary but control was soon lost over the troops and the town was looted and burned. Ormonde arrested both commanders following complaints by their former colleague, Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt, who was representing Archduke Charles. They were court-martialled on their return to England; O'Hara, a long-time client of the Ormonde family, was acquitted and promoted to Lieutenant-General in 1704. Sir Henry was dismissed from the service and although later reinstated in the army and appointed Governor of Berwick in 1713, this effectively ended his military career. He continued to sit as an MP but when George I became King in 1714, he and other Tories were ejected from government. He died in London in 1717. Legacy In 1701 he bought Brancepeth Castle, near the city of Durham, which passed to his granddaughter Bridget (or Mary) who allegedly inspired the song Bobby Shafto. She died unmarried and left it to her cousin, who sold it soon afterwards.

Eugene Sharrer had been the owner of three large and two smaller estates, all largely undeveloped when he transferred them to the company. These included land in the Shire Highlands, but also in the Shire valley.<ref name=\\"Pachai\\">B. Pachai (1978). Land and Politics in Malawi 1875-1975, pp. 37-40.</ref> The British Central Africa Company Ltd acquired 372,500 acres from Sharrer in 1902. Its two most productive estates were in the Shire valley: Kupimbi of around 68,000 acres in the Middle Shire, which grew tobacco, and Chelumbo of about 132,000 acres in the Upper Shire, which grew cotton.<ref>M. Vaughan (1987). The Story of an African Famine, p. 61.</ref> A third Shire valley estate of about 17,000 acres near Chikwawa also grew cotton. The company also owned two estates in the Shire Highlands. Its estate at Cholo was originally its largest one, of over 150,000 acres, but by 1920 around 20,000 acres had been sold or leased. Around 6,000 acres of the 28,000 acre Kubula estate, northwest of the centre of Blantyre had also been sold or leased, but it was overpopulated, with 5,713 registered tenants on 1929 and 4,500 in 1939, most of whom were heads of families. By 1924, the company had sold or leased almost 77,000 acres of its original 372,500 acres. Of the 295,500 acres the British Central Africa Company Ltd held directly in that year, it actively farmed only 6,000 acres itself, the remainder was cultivated by tenants or fallow.<ref>UK Colonial Office (1921).

Vaughan (1987). The Story of an African Famine, p. 73. </ref> In 1948 the government set up a Land Planning Committee, whose first report recommended that government should re- acquire land which was either undeveloped or occupied by large numbers of Africans. This included the projected re-purchase of about two-thirds of the British Central Africa Company‚Äôs freehold land. The company had long fought to retain its landholdings, much of which was undeveloped, claiming that soil exhaustion and erosion, deforestation and poor husbandry would result if the land were resettled by smallholders. In 1948, the company was still unwilling to sell its better land to the government.<ref>B. Pachai (1973). Land Policies in Malawi: An Examination of the Colonial Legacy, p. 691</ref> However, it was prepared to sell inferior land, and in 1948 the government bought freehold land from the British Central Africa Company in the Chingale area in the western part of Zomba District to convert it to land held by customary tenure and resettle Africans evacuated from other estates in the Shire valley and highlands on it. The Chingale resettlement scheme took place from 1948 to 1954.<ref>J.A.K. Kandawire (1977). Thangata in Pre-Colonial and Colonial Systems of Land Tenure in Southern Malawi, p. 188.</ref> Following a serious famine in 1949, Geoffrey Colby, the Governor of Nyasaland from 1948 to 1956, attempted to get the major estate companies to sell the under-used parts of their land to the government for resettlement. However, Colby made it clear he would not use the compulsory purchase powers he had been granted, preferring voluntary agreement. By ruling compulsion out, he gave unintended encouragement to the British Central Africa Company‚Äôs plans to retain its estates.<ref>J. McCracken (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859-1966, pp. 306-9.</ref> In 1955, the Nyasaland government agreed to purchase almost 36,470 acres in Cholo District with 24,600 residents from the British Central Africa Company for resettlement. Before this, the company had owned 74,262 acres with 36,400 residents. The company retained 38,143 acres, but of the 11,800 residents, 3,240 were moved onto Crown lands.<ref name=\\"Baker\\" /> However, it was only in 1962, when independence was clearly in prospect, that the company accepted the need to sell its surplus land, retaining only its most profitable assets.<ref>J. McCracken (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859-1966, pp. 393.</ref> At the time of its takeover by Lonrho (Malawi) Ltd in 1964, the Central Africa Company Ltd owned a 3,500 acre tea plantation, two tea factories and some other small estates.<ref name=\\"Bower\\" /> The Central Africa Company Ltd, with its remaining agricultural assets, was sold by Lonrho to African Plantations Corporation June 1997.<ref name=\\"malawilii\\" /> Agricultural activities The basis of estate agriculture in Nyasaland for much of the colonial period was the system of thangata which, in the early colonial period, meant that African on estates had to perform agricultural labour in lieu of the rent for a plot of land on which they could grow food.<ref>J.A.K. Kandawire (1977). Thangata in Pre-Colonial and Colonial Systems of Land Tenure in Southern Malawi, pp. 185, 187.</ref> At first, estates usually required two months‚Äô labour a year from adult men, one month for their rent, the second in reimbursement of the Hut tax paid by the landowner on behalf of tenants. Widows and other single women who were tenants were usually exempted from the rental obligation and did not pay hut tax. However, on some estates the obligations of labour tenants were extended, and abuses such as requiring 30 days work (five weeks of six days), rather than allowing Sundays as rest days, for each month of thangata or requiring that women heading households should work to satisfy rent due were introduced.<ref>L. White (1987). Magomero: Portrait of an African Village, Cambridge University Press, pp. 79-81, 86-9, 146-9. </ref> The demand for estate labour declined in the 1920s, and British Central Africa Company was the first estate owner to modify thangata. The company issued seed to African tenants so that they could grow cotton or tobacco under supervision, and then sell their crops to the company at low prices. The Natives on Private Estates Ordinance 1928 formalised this arrangement by allowing landlords to receive rents in cash, in a fixed quantity of acceptable crops or by direct labour. The types of permissible crops and their quantities were fixed for each district by government officials. At this time, the term thangata applied both to rent in kind, common on tobacco and cotton estates, and to the older form of labour thangata, which persisted on the tea estates that required direct labour.<ref>J.A.K. Kandawire (1977). Thangata in Pre-Colonial and Colonial Systems of Land Tenure in Southern Malawi, p. 188.</ref> =Cotton= Cotton was first planted in the Shire valley by Eugene Sharrer, and the British Central Africa Company continued to grow cotton on its Chelumbo and Chikwawa estates. From 1903 the company also encouraged cotton cultivation by African smallholders in the Upper Shire District, by distributing cheap Egyptian cotton seed. The company gave instruction on the method of cultivation and agreed to buy the future crop at a guaranteed (but low) price.<ref>P.T. Terry (1962). The Rise of the African Cotton Industry in Nyasaland, 1902 to 1918, pp. 59-61.</ref> There was no significant shortage of land for peasant farming in the Upper Shire Valley, as the British Central Africa Company only exploited a small proportion of its land and, until the 1930s, the company tolerated squatters who did not pay rent on its land. Its tenants had to perform labour thangata or grow cotton for sale to the company, but in general there was plenty of land available for food production. The efforts of the colonial administration to introduce cotton as a peasant cash-crop were largely unsuccessful, as the prices paid to the peasants were low, so they concentrated on growing food.<ref>M. Vaughan (1982). Food Production and Family Labour in Southern Malawi, pp. 361-2.</ref> The British Central Africa Company Ltd also had a cotton ginnery for processing its own and smallholder cotton until at least 1961. In 1971, the purchase and processing of smallholder cotton was taken over by a parastatal body.<ref>K. Garbett (1984). Land, Labour and Cotton in the Lower Shire Valley, Malawi, p.111.</ref> =Tobacco= In 1902, Sharrer's landholdings in Cholo district were sold to the British Central Africa Company Ltd. For the first two decades of the 20th century, the area remained undeveloped and relatively under-populated. Small amounts of cotton, sisal and tobacco were grown but the tobacco was hit by disease, the value of sisal was low and the cool weather was unsuitable for cotton.<ref>R.B. Boeder (1982). Peasants and Plantations in the Mulanje and Thyolo Districts of Southern Malawi, 1891-1951, pp. 7-8.</ref> With the construction of the Shire Highlands Railway from Port Herald to Blantyre, which opened in 1908, the estates began to grow Flue-cured tobacco, and The British Central Africa Company Ltd was able to interest the Imperial Tobacco Company in Nyasaland tobacco. The company imported good quality seed and brought in experts, at first aiming to produce cigar leaf, but later concentrating on flue-cured leaf for cigarettes. By 1907, the British Central Africa Company had 14 barns for flue-curing tobacco, out of a total of 119 such barns in the protectorate.<ref>W.H.J. Rangeley (1957). A Brief History of the Tobacco Industry in Nyasaland, Part I, pp. 71-3.</ref> At the end of the First World War, the company started a scheme for settling ex-servicemen on its undeveloped land as tobacco growers. About 50 men took up farms, usually of 1,000 acres. Many failed in the period from 1920 to 1924, as none had a farming background or any farming training. Some survived until a drastic fall in prices for flue-cured tobacco after 1927, but then took up whatever employment they could find.<ref>J.E.R. Emtage (1984). Reminiscences - Nyasaland 1925 ‚Äì 1939, pp. 12, 20</ref> After 1927, the production of dark- fired tobacco by African farmers, either estate tenants or on Crown lands, overtook that of flue-cured tobacco, and the British Central Africa Company, which already had a scheme for its tenants to grow tobacco under supervision, became mostly a broker for the tobacco those tenants produced.<ref>L. White (1987). Magomero: Portrait of an African Village, pp. 173-4.</ref> =Tea= It took many years for tea to become a major crop in Nyasaland, and in the colonial period it was almost exclusively grown on estates. From 1922 to 1932, each year saw a small but significant increase in the acreage of tea, most of which was in Mlanje District.<ref>C.A. Baker (1962). Nyasaland, The History of its Export Trade, pp. 16, 20, 24-6.</ref> After 1931, tea growing expanded into Cholo District, where the British Central Africa Company had large estates, and for the two following decades the amount of tea grown increased steadily. The expansion of tea-planting in Cholo led to a shortage of African labour by 1938. During the Second World War, this labour shortage was contained, but after 1945 it became acute. In 1945, the British Central Africa Company planted 1,147 of the 12,321 acres of tea in Cholo District, making it the second largest producer in that district.<ref>R. Palmer (1985). The Nyasaland Tea Industry in the Era of International Tea Restrictions, 1933-1950, pp. 218, 235, 238.</ref> The company had formerly relied on labour tenants for much of its workforce, but in 1946, its local Manager complained that thangata was virtually unenforceable, as the workers ignored their contracts with impunity. The company had a very poor relationship with the tenants on its two estates of in northern Cholo and was unable to enforce unpopular thangata agreements or Sunday working.<ref name=\\"Palmer\\" /> =Cholo riots= The bulk of the 103,957 acres the company owned in the district were undeveloped, and local people wanted access to this land. After the company introduced restrictions on the size of the gardens that tenants could plant for their own use on company land in 1945, many of them refused to pay any rent. Some 1,250 tenants were threatened with eviction and, although the government limited the actual evictions to 120, those spared eviction still felt resentment towards the company. There was a further crisis in 1952 and 1953 when a collapse in world tea prices put the British Central Africa Company into a financial deficit. Its local General Manager tried to make good the loss of income by increasing tenants‚Äô rents. Until 1952, the maximum rent permitted by the 1928 Natives on Private Estates Ordinance was 20 shillings or ¬£1 but in that year the 1952 Africans on Private Estates Ordinance proposed an increase in the maximum to 52 shillings and sixpence (¬£2.625) from July 1953. Although most other estate companies agreed not to charge this maximum, the British Central Africa Company demanded the 52 shillings and sixpence maximum from December 1952. A number of tenants resisted the increase, and the company issued eviction notices, which the government was legally obliged to enforce, but was reluctant to do. In June 1953, the company agreed not to enforce either the evictions or the rent increase. However, its tenants had begun to clear land on undeveloped parts of the company's estates and start cultivation. Many local people refused to pay taxes or attend courts, and riots broke out in Cholo in August 1953, leading to eleven dead and seventy- two injured. Following these riots, Governor Colby urged that another 300,000 acres, including much British Central Africa Company land, should be acquired through voluntary purchase, but the Colonial Office did not support this, so little happened.<ref>R. Palmer (1986). Working Conditions and Worker Responses on the Nyasaland Tea Estates, 1930-1953, pp. 122-3, 125.</ref> In 1963, the company still retained a 3,500 acre tea plantation and two tea factories.<ref name=\\"Bower\\" />  References Sources *C.

He was born in Slawi, the capital of the Tegal Regency, and died in 2014. Traditionally, wayang is linked with drinking and debauchery, which initially was a reason for Gundono not to feel attached to this kind of shadow theater. During his study at a madrassa in Lebaksiu though, his interest was rekindled, and in 1997 he staged his first grass puppet show in Riau.Jakarta Post (September 4, 2010) biography In 1999 he finished his study in Puppetry at the Art Academy (STSI) in Surakarta, also known as Solo, which is called Institute Seni Indonesia (ISI) nowadays. The same year he founded his theater company in Surakarta, called Sanggar Wayang Suket, which means translated: Grass Puppet Studio. Here he developed the wayang puppetry that had not developed in the country for a long time. Within several years, the artist with a weight of 150 kg grew to be an icon in the wayang suket (grass puppet).

This was the first of two albums that Martin released in 1967. He had released five albums in 1966, as well as appearing in his television show and starring in three films. Martin's eight previous singles had been Top 40 hits between 1964 and 1966; three tracks from this album, \\"Nobody's Baby Again\\", \\"(Open Up the Door) Let the Good Times In,\\" and \\"Lay Some Happiness on Me,\\" had previously been released as singles. Happiness Is Dean Martin peaked at 46 on the Billboard 200, while two of his albums from 1966 were still on the charts. \\"I'm Not the Marrying Kind\\", Martin's recording of Lalo Schifrin's theme song to the 1966 Matt Helm film he starred in, Murderer's Row, appears on this album. It did not appear on the film's soundtrack. Happiness Is Dean Martin was reissued on CD by Hip-O Records in 2009. Martin finished recording the album two days before an engagement at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas. His popularity at the Sands was such that Variety reported that \\"the room could have been filled twice over for each of the two shows\\". The album cover shows Dean holding the Mattel doll called \\"Baby's Hungry!\\" that was new for 1967. (Mattel toys were sometimes featured on the Dean Martin Variety Hour. In a clip from one show in 1965, Dean sings \\"Thank Heaven for Little Girls\\" surrounded by the Mattel doll that was new for 1965, \\"Baby First Step\\".) Reception The initial Billboard review from May 6, 1967 commented that \\"Martin continues his winning style here...his relaxed smooth singing was never better\\". William Ruhlmann on Allmusic.com gave the album two and a half stars out of five. Noting the relatively poor chart performance of Martin's recent singles, Ruhlmann commented that it was time to \\"change the formula\\", but described Martin's cover of Patsy Cline's song \\"She's Got You\\" as the most impressive on the album.

Throughout military history and the history of terrorism, water supply attacks have been perpetrated by political groups, intending to scare, cause death, or drought. Chemical and biological attacks=Examples= In 1984, members of the Rajneeshee religious cult contaminated a city water supply tank in The Dalles, Oregon, using Salmonella and infected 750 people. In 1992 The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) put lethal concentrations of potassium cyanide in the water tanks of a Turkish Air Force compound in Istanbul. In 2000, workers at the Cellatex chemical plant in northern France dumped 5000 liters of sulfuric acid into a tributary of the Meuse River when they were denied workers‚Äô benefits. In 2000, Queensland police arrested a man for using a computer and a radio transmitter to take control of the Maroochy Shire wastewater system and release sewage into parks, rivers and property. =LSD threats to the water supply= Despite the fact that it is impractical and very unlikely to produce any effect at large scale, during the 1960s a great deal of attention was paid to the notion that counter-culture figures could intoxicate a whole city by putting a small dose of LSD in the water supply. On 19 March 1966 London Life ran an interview claiming that anyone could take control of London in under eight hours by putting 'acid' in the water system. Dr Donald Johnson claimed: \\"It is quite feasible that LSD could be used to take over a city or even a country. I agree if it were put into reservoirs, it would disable people sufficiently for an enemy to take control.\\" On November 1966 Vue magazine ran \\"Why They Had to Outlaw LSD\\", in which writer WH Carr claimed that \\"[A] few ounces of it, dumped in the water supply of a major city, could shake up millions.\\" Counter-culture icon Abbie Hoffman threatened to put LSD in Chicago's water-supply to protest the Vietnam War during the Democratic convention. Infrastructural or resource-based attacks=History= In Lusaka, Zambia, in 1999, a bomb destroyed the main water pipeline, cutting off water for the city 3 million. In 2001 Water flow to Kumanovo (population 100,000) was cut off for 12 days in conflict between ethnic Albanians and Macedonian forces. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) detonated a bomb inside a tunnel in the Chingaza Dam, which provides most of Bogot√°‚Äôs water. Four incendiary devices were found in the pumping station of a Michigan water-bottling plant. The Earth Liberation Front (ELF) claimed responsibility, accusing Ice Mountain Water Company of stealing water for profit. In 2003 Jordanian authorities arrested Iraqi agents in connection with a failed plot to poison the water supply that serves American troops in the eastern Jordanian desert near the border with Iraq. In 2006 Tamil Tiger rebels cut the water supply to government-held villages in northeastern Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan government forces then launched attacks on the reservoir, declaring the Tamil actions to be terrorism. =Draining of the Mesopotamian Marshes= The draining of the Mesopotamian Marshes occurred in Iraq and to a smaller degree in Iran between the 1950s and 1990s to clear large areas of the marshes in the Tigris-Euphrates river system. Formerly covering an area of around , the main sub-marshes, the Hawizeh, Central, and Hammar Marshes were all drained at different times for different reasons. Initial draining of the Central Marshes was intended to reclaim land for agriculture but later all three marshes became a tool of war and revenge. Many international organizations such as the U.N. Human Rights Commission, the Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), the International Wildfowl and Wetlands Research Bureau, and Middle East Watch have described the draining as a political attempt to force the Ma'dan people out of the area through water diversion tactics. In popular culture * Kurt Vonnegut's book Cat's Cradle (1963) describes a fictional chemical that freezes water at room temperature and ends up destroying the world. * In 1966, Robert Thom published the short story called \\"The Day It All Happened, Baby!\\", which became the film Wild in the Streets directed by Barry Shear in 1968 and in which LSD added to the water supply of Washington, D.C. is a crucial plot device. * The film The Tuxedo, starring Jackie Chan, features a power-hungry bottled-water mogul trying to destroy the world's natural water supply to force everyone to drink his bottled water. * The film Batman Begins portrays a terrorist's attempt to introduce a vapor- borne hallucinogen into the water system. * The film Waterborne is set in the aftermath of a bio-terrorist attack on the water supply of Los Angeles. * The film V for Vendetta (2006) features corrupt government leaders contaminating London's water supply. * In the video game Final Fantasy VI (1994), a siege on the fictional kingdom of Doma by an army of the Gestahlian Empire is broken when Kefka Palazzo releases a deadly poison into Doma's water supply. This not only breaks the siege, but kills most of Doma's inhabitants in the process.

Described as \\"A Farcical Fact in Three Acts\\", the play depicts the idle son of a rich manufacturer setting up a spurious business in competition with his father. It was first presented on the Broadway stage on 8 September 1914, at the Cohan TheatreMegrue and Hackett (1917), p. 3 and ran for nearly a year.Bordman, p. 8 The playwrights substantially rewrote the play for a new production in London by the actor-manager Tom Walls, at the Aldwych Theatre. This opened on 2 February 1924 and closed on 10 July 1925, a total of 598 performances.\\"New Play at the Aldwych, The Times, 2 February 1924, p. 8; \\"Mr. Ralph Lynn\\", The Times, 10 August 1962, p. 11; and \\"The Theatres\\", The Times, 25 June 1925, p. 12 It was the first of a sequence of twelve \\"Aldwych farces\\" presented at the theatre until 1933, mostly original farces written by Ben Travers. By contrast with later plays in the series, in which Walls played worldly and sometimes shady characters, with Ralph Lynn as his na√Øve associate, in It Pays to Advertise Walls's character is upright and conventional, and Lynn is the manipulative schemer.

While she waits, the Comtesse de Beaurien is shown in, wishing to see Sir Henry. As she does not speak English, and Mary speaks no French, communication is difficult. Eventually having worked out that Mary is suggesting she should return at eight o'clock, the Comtesse leaves. Rodney enters. He is in love with Mary; she insists that he should seek his father's consent to their marriage. Sir Henry enters, in a bad temper, supposedly from an attack of gout. He asks Mary to leave, and when Rodney tells him of his desire to marry Mary he reacts with fierce hostility. He says that Mary is seeking to marry Rodney solely for his money, and to prove the point he announces that if they marry, Rodney will be disinherited. The young couple defy him. Rodney declares that he will set up in business. He goes upstairs to pack a bag before leaving his father's house. When he has gone it emerges that Sir Henry and Mary are in cahoots, seeking to drive the idle Rodney into earning a living for himself. Sir Henry and a business rival have bet a large sum on which of their sons will outshine the other in commerce. Mary assures Sir Henry that she is not in love with Rodney, and proposes to break off the engagement once he has got himself established in business. A press agent, Ambrose Peal, is shown in. He once did Rodney an important favour, and now wants him to reciprocate. As a publicity stunt for a show, Peale wants Rodney to stage a mock abduction of the leading lady in his private aeroplane. Rodney refuses, feeling that it would upset Mary, but Peale's enthusiasm for publicity gives Rodney his plan to make money. He will set up as a soap manufacturer in competition with his father, using Peale's skill as a publicist to market \\"the most expensive soap in the world\\". Sir Henry has never gone in for advertising to any extent, and is inclined to pooh-pooh it. The problem is that Rodney has no capital to fund the necessary factory. The Comtesse returns. She addresses Rodney as if he were Sir Henry. Rodney's French is adequate for him to understand that she wishes to acquire the rights to sell his father's soap in France (\\"mon p√®re's soap ‚Äì not Pears', father's\\"). Instead he sells her the French rights to his new soap. He then borrows ¬£2,000 from a business friend of his father's (the money is in fact Sir Henry's, secretly channelled via his friend). =Act II= ;Rodney Martin's office Rodney, abetted by Mary and Peale, has set up his company. He is not yet in a position to manufacture his soap, but is finding ever more ways of publicising his non-existent product. The firm's debts heavily outweigh its meagre assets. Rodney bamboozles one creditor into co-operation, but is taken aback when the Comtesse turns out to be a fraud. She had intended to swindle Sir Henry but decided that Rodney was an easier target. Without the expected money for the French rights, Rodney faces ruin. Sir Henry enters. Rodney maintains the pretence that his business is flourishing, and is backed by his father's main commercial rival. Sir Henry is provoked into offering to buy out Rodney's company, but Mary inadvertently reveals the true state of the enterprise. Sir Henry reacts with anger that she and Rodney have tried to deceive and swindle him. After he has left, an order arrives from Lewis's store in Liverpool for 50,000 bars of the exclusive soap. As they have no soap to sell, the conspirators start ringing round Sir Henry's factories to acquire some immediately. =Act III= ;The library at Sir Henry's house Rodney's attempt to buy and re-sell soap from Sir Henry's factories has quickly come to his father's notice. After the first 5,000 bars, the supply was cut off, leaving Rodney in default on his lucrative contract. Sir Henry reveals to Rodney that he had underwritten the Liverpool order, at considerable cost to himself. He is completely certain that no amount of advertising could make such excessively overpriced soap sellable. He is then greatly nonplussed to discover that Lewis's are keen to obtain the remaining 45,000 bars, as the advertising campaign has created a huge demand. While he is considering the implications of this, the Comtesse calls on him. She is seeking to swindle him by pretending to have been swindled by Rodney and extracting redress from his father, but Peale arrives and exposes her. Sir Henry decides that Rodney's much sought-after brand of soap is a commercial winner. He buys out the company, after much hard bargaining. Rodney reveals that he and Mary were married earlier in the day. Reception When the piece opened in New York in its original version, at the Cohan Theatre, one critic commented, \\"George M. Cohan is very clever at picking winners.\\"Theatre Magazine, Volume 20, 1914, p. 159 A similar thought was expressed when the revised edition of the play was premiered in London. The Observer wondered how it was that Walls and his business partner Leslie Henson had the knack of spotting the few good farces among the many bad ones that they must have had to read. \\"It is hopelessly silly in idea, and it is written with a complete knowledge of all standard tricks and requirements. And it is not offensive to taste. And it is extremely amusing.\\"\\"It Pays to Advertise\\", The Observer, 3 February 1924, p. 11 Adaptations and revivals It Pays to Advertise (1931) Four versions of the play have been made for the cinema: a silent film in 1919, directed by Donald Crisp;\\"It Pays to Advertise (1919)\\" IMdB, accessed 16 February 2013 a talkie in 1931, directed by Frank Tuttle;\\"It Pays to Advertise (1931)\\" IMdB, accessed 16 February 2013 the French film ' (1932) by Karl Anton; and the Swedish film ' (1936), directed by Anders Henrikson.\\"It Pays to Advertise (1936)\\", IMdB, accessed 16 February 2013 A novelised version of the play adapted by Samuel Field was published in New York in 1915.\\"It Pays to Advertise\\", WorldCat, accessed 16 February 2013 The play has not been professionally revived in London.

Washington The first Day of Remembrance, observing the day that Executive Order 9066 was signed and authorizing the Japanese American internment, was in the state of Washington on November 25, 1978, organized by the Evacuation Redress Committee. Co-sponsors included thirty churches, veterans' groups, and other social organizations, as well as the national Japanese American Citizens League (JACL). The event took place mainly at the Puyallup fairgrounds, which had served in 1942 as the assembly center named Camp Harmony. Although initially resistant, the board of the Western Washington Fair ultimately voted unanimously to allow the event to use the fairgrounds free of charge. The National Guard provided several large trucks similar to those used in 1942 to lead a caravan from Sicks' Stadium in Seattle to Puyallup, replicating the route taken by some of the internees.Jennifer Ott, First Day of Remembrance (of World War II incarceration of Japanese Americans) is held at the Puyallup Fairgrounds on November 25, 1978, HistoryLink article 9464, August 23, 2010.

It allowed the repatriation of prisoners of war and interned officials held in the three countries after the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. The agreement has been criticised for Pakistan's failure to repatriate Urdu-speakers in Bangladesh and not holding to account 195 senior military officials accused of breach of conduct during war. The treaty was signed by the foreign ministers of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh in New Delhi after the Simla Agreement. Background During the 1971 Bangladesh War, thousands of Bengali bureaucrats and military personnel were interned in West Pakistan along with their families by the Pakistani Government. In Bangladesh, many in the Urdu- speaking community wished to relocate to Pakistan. India held several thousand Pakistani prisoners of war after the Surrender of Pakistan on 16 December 1971, including 195 military officers held for breach of conduct. President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto threatened to put interned Bengali officials on trial if Bangladesh proceeded with plans to indict alleged Pakistani war criminals. Implementation The treaty came into effect on 8 August 1973 and ended on 1 July 1974. Under the terms of the agreement, UNHCR supervised the repatriation of Bangladeshi and Pakistani citizens. According to the UN, 121,695 Bengalis were moved from Pakistan to Bangladesh. They included high-level Bengali civil servants and military officers. 108,744 non-Bengali civilians and civil servants were moved from Bangladesh to Pakistan. India released 6,500 Pakistani PoWs, who were mostly transported by train to Pakistan.http://www.genocidebangladesh.org/text-of-the-tri-patriate-agreement- of-bangladesh-pakistan-india/ In 1974, General Niazi was the last Pakistan officer symbolically repatriated through the Wagah Border. Although the agreement called for the repatriation of Urdu-speaking Biharis in Bangladesh, the Pakistani Government backtracked on its promise to resettle the community in Pakistan. This gave rise to the stateless Stranded Pakistani community in Bangladesh. War crimes suspects Among the PoWs, 195 Pakistani military officers held in India were identified as prime war crimes suspects. Pakistan pressed for their release as one of its key demands. It pressured several Muslim countries to withhold recognition of Bangladesh until the release of the 195 officers. India favoured their repatriation to Pakistan. In the text of the agreement, the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, Kamal Hossain, stated that: > the excesses and manifold crimes committed by those prisoners of war > constituted, according to the relevant provisions of the UN General Assembly > resolutions and international law, war crimes, crimes against humanity and > genocide, and that there was universal consensus that persons charged with > such crimes as 195 Pakistani prisoners of war should be held to account and > subjected to the due process of law. Pakistan evaded Bangladesh's request to hold the trial of war crimes suspects. However, Aziz Ahmed, the Pakistani delegate at the Delhi meeting, stated that his government \\"deeply regretted any crimes that may have been committed\\". Legacy The repatriation was an important milestone in reconciliation between Bangladesh and Pakistan. The two countries established diplomatic relations in 1974. In Bangladesh, many repatriated officials rose to prominence. A notable example was Justice Abdus Sattar, the 9th President of Bangladesh. Many repatriated military personnel served in the leadership of the Bangladesh Armed Forces, including Rear Admiral Mahbub Ali Khan and Lt General Muhammad Mahbubur Rahman. Pakistan's refusal to repatriate stateless Urdu-speakers in Bangladesh remains a major sore point in Bangladesh-Pakistan relations.

Uniquely for a tower house of its type in Ireland, Newtown Castle is mostly cylindrical in shape but rises from a square pyramidical base. It is today part of the Burren College of Art. History Newtown Castle was likely built circa 1550 for the O'Brien clan. In the Forfeitures and Distribution books of 1641 it was listed as property of Donogh O'Brien. However, Newtown Castle soon passed into possession of the O'Lochlainn (or O'Loghlen) family, the most powerful clan of the area. The Ordnance Survey of 1839 names Charles O'Loghlen as inhabitant of the castle and describes the tower as being in good repair. Charles O'Loghlen was locally known as the \\"King of the Burren\\". In 1848, the landlord, the then Marquess of Buckingham who had been bankrupted sold the local lands. The Buckingham estates in County Clare, around in the Barony of Burren were purchased for 30,000 pounds by one Richard Samuel Guinness, acting as agent for Colonel Henry White. At the time of the Griffith's valuation in the 1850s, the building next to the castle, erected in about 1820, was a rectory inhabited by the Reverend Hugh B. Howlett. At the end of the 19th century Peter O'Loghlen lived in the castle. He was referred to as the \\"Prince of the Burren\\". During reconstruction (see below) limited excavations were conducted at Newtown Castle. The results indicated that the castle may be late 16th or early 17th century, rather than mid-16th century. Signs of the presence of a significant population (animal and shellfish remains and a large cobbled space) were also discovered in the area. This gave rise to speculation whether the name \\"Newtown\\" may actually have referred to a new settlement near the castle. An R√°th. Architecture Newtown Castle is one of only a few cylindrical tower houses in the area. In all of Ireland, only around 30 of the roughly 3,000 tower houses are round. In addition, Newtown Castle features an unusual pyramidical base, which makes it unique in all of Ireland. The tower has four upper floors. The ground floor and first floor feature vaulted ceilings. There are gun-loops on the first floor. A doorway at second-floor level may have connected with a long vanished adjacent building. These features and the mouldings of the windows point to a sixteenth-century date. The tower was restored for use as the Burren College of Art with a conical oak roof and opened in July 1994 by Mary Robinson.Peter Harbison, 'The Limerick Area', Archaeological Journal, 153 (London, 1996), p. 348. Today Newtown Castle was restored in 1993‚Äì94 for use by the newly established Burren College of Art, which was opened by president Mary Robinson in 1994. It is available as a venue for weddings and conferences. The castle is located on the Burren Way, a long distance trail. The castle is in the townland of Newton, parish of Drumcreehy. The tower is open to the public on weekdays. References * George Cunningham: Burren Journey. Shannonside. Limerick 1978. * George Cunningham: Burren Journey West. Shannonside.

Childhood Robert was born in Havana, Cuba and had a peripatetic childhood as his father worked for Marconi Communications as a communications engineer, designing and installing telegraph systems throughout Latin America (Cuba, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina). Robert's father Carlos was of Northern Italian and Mexican Indian descent, fluent in both Spanish and Italian, and an Italian citizen. He worked with David Sarnoff at Marconi Communications and Sarnoff would then later found RCA. Prior to the outbreak of WWII when Italy became allied with Germany, Sarnoff offered Carlos a job at RCA and facilitated the visas for his immediate family to immigrate to the US from Italy. Onorio Ruotolo of the Leonardo da Vinci Art School in New York recognized Robert's talents as a child painter and accepted him as the youngest student in the school at nine years of age. Robert traveled alone daily to the school via the elevated subway from Maspeth, Queens then back home nine hours later. Carlos located the school through his acquaintance with Ruotolo, also from northern Italy. The School emphasized traditional European art training with extensive time spent drawing life size plaster casts of classical Greco Roman sculptures and extensive instruction on human anatomy. Robert was trained as Italian artists are trained as in the tradition of the Renaissance, where emphasis is first placed on drawing from classical Greek and Roman sculpture, before graduating to life model drawing and the study of perspective and then on to art history. The School marked Robert's introduction to and lifelong admiration of Vesalius' anatomical drawings, and he would return to this reference book throughout his career, especially when he was sculpting. At the school, Robert developed a friendship with the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the two maintained contact for many years thereafter. Noguchi had a long relationship with the School and like Robert, was a favorite of Ruotolo. Also like Robert, Noguchi was obviously very different and stood apart from the other teachers and students: he was Japanese American and the oldest teacher at the time, Robert was the youngest student and still learning English. Noguchi enabled \\"Robbie\\" to attend the life drawing classes where subjects were nude models. (Robert's young age was the reason he wasn't allowed in these classes‚Äîthe older students found his advanced skill level upsetting.). Robert attended life modeling classes throughout his career and found the experience of life drawing an important resource that helped him resolve technical issues when developing new works. In 1931 at the age of eleven, Robert was a recipient of a Wannamaker Prize bestowed upon the best child artist in New York City. The individual prizes were commemorative medals in the likeness of Rutherford B. Hayes the nineteenth President of the United States. This was one of his most cherished possessions and he carried it with him as an army intelligence officer during World War II.  Education  Leonardo da Vinci School, (1930 - 1938) New York University School of Architecture and Allied Arts. Bachelor of Fine Arts, magna cum laude, 1940 Yale University School of Art, MFA, 1942 Robert received his bachelor's degree from New York University School of Architecture and Allied Arts graduating magna cum laude in 1940, and a Masters of Fine Arts from Yale University School of Fine Arts in 1942. His masters thesis was on the Italian painter and sculptor Modigliani. Robert was working on abstractions, portraits, cityscapes and representational works simultaneously during his years as a student at NYU and Yale.  Military service  United States Army Rangers, Military Intelligence (1943-1946) In September 1945 as an officer in U.S. Army Intelligence, Master Sergeant Robert Borgatta (along with Corporal Nunzio Barbaro of Brooklyn and Lester J. McDonnell of Cleveland, Ohio) testified in the trial of Rita Louisa Zucca also known as ‚ÄúAxis Sally.‚Äù Zucca who had renounced her American citizenship in 1941 was broadcasting Nazi propaganda to U.S. troops in the Mediterranean. The tribunal would sentence her to four years for conspiring with the enemy with the intent of demoralizing U.S. soldiers. Robert was also featured again on the front page of the Times for a more light-hearted piece regarding his liberation of a small Italian village. The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was a precursor to the CIA and Robert performed his duties through his Army Rangers attachment as an interrogator of Axis prisoners in Italy and North Africa. His fluency in five languages: French, Spanish, Italian, German and English, along with charm and presence, made him an effective interrogator. Despite these skills and his college degree, he refused officer commissions and stayed at the rank of Master Sergeant. His first hand experiences at Monte Cassino changed him into a lifelong pacifist and an anti-war activist during the Viet Nam era.  Early Career  Robert had returned to New York a World War II veteran having spent three years overseas (1943‚Äì46), and prior to that having completed his MFA at Yale (1942). His paintings in this period are mostly moody, dense urban landscapes and abstractions. Upon his return, Robert received an important commission from the prizefighter Joe Louis to produce a mural for Joe Louis‚Äô nightclub and restaurant in Harlem: a fifty by eight foot mural (400 sq. ft.) depicting black contributions to American culture. Among the historic figures he portrayed were Booker T. Washington, Dr. George Washington Carver, Paul Robeson, Bill ‚ÄúBojangles‚Äù Robinson and Marian Anderson. Robert's objective was to ‚Äúrepresent most of the distinguished black personalities in American history‚Äù. Joe Louis was also a war veteran and like Robert, an outsider in America. They were to remain lifelong friends. A wonderful Times Magazine photo shows Robert visiting Joe in the hospital, shortly before his announced retirement from his boxing career. = 1940-1960‚ÄîWaterscapes = The waterscapes form a large collection ranging from the abstract to impressionistic. Promontories and the meeting of the land and sea are prevalent themes, and perspective takes on a full range of expression. = 1940-1960‚ÄîLandscapes = An extensive collection, the landscapes include alpine scenes, cliffs, ravines and the Palisades. There are numerous panoramic paintings, including ‚ÄòFrom St. Michaels‚Äô, ‚ÄòAndalusia‚Äô and ‚Äò038‚Äô. These works were produced completely from sketches and recalled visits. = 1970's = For the first half of his life, Robert craved being American with a capital A: acceptance, admiration, acquiring things, and ambition. This was reflected in his position as a young tenured professor, the large number of solo gallery exhibitions, executing mural commissions, and advertising graphics work. His ability to routinely sell his work, coupled with his salary as an art professor and other art-related income was a source of pride that he made his living and supported his family solely as an artist. Robert was also instrumental in obtaining jobs for his peers including Phillip Pearlstein among others. Robert served on the board of directors of the National Society of Painters of Casein and was affiliated with the National Arts Club  Mid to later works = 1970-1980‚ÄîCreation Series = The Creation Series marked departures in previous painting styles. During this period, he was sculpting simultaneously while painting. Similar to the Babcock disapproving of his evolving away from genres they preferred, years earlier John Canaday the art critic voiced similar frustration is several of his reviews of Robert's works. The issue of being pigeon-holed irked Robert and the dictum that one could only be defined as a painter for one style was not acceptable to him. Continuing to venture into new genres, he created during the early seventies ‚Äúslide triptychs‚Äù where each panel of a painting would represent a greater magnification of his subject. In the egg and slide triptychs, the preliminary studies or smaller works would contain more depth of detail then the larger final works. The smaller water colors completed his output during this period. These significant changes in the direction of his work in terms of his paintings and his new direction into sculpting caused Robert's falling out with the Babcock Galleries‚Äîthey would not show his sculpture because he was associated with their gallery as a painter and they wouldn't show the new creation paintings because these were too different from the mystical, moody abstractions and landscapes he was known for. Although he missed exhibiting, separating from the Babcock Galleries freed him from producing with exhibitions and sales in mind and coincided with a new direction in his work, one that proved ultimately more introspection and brought him great personal satisfaction. A counterbalance to reduced exhibiting was the ability to work as he wished. = 1975-1985‚ÄîSculpture = During this period, Robert began sculpting (stone carving, mostly marble) and also painting what he later termed Egg Paintings, which became part of his Creation Series of paintings. = 1990-2000‚ÄîWaterscapes = These waterscapes show a marked departure in style and content from the waterscapes during the 1940-1960 period. Gardens and natural parks like the Everglades were subject matters and numerous photographs from 1990-2010 Photographic Studies for Paintings were used to plan these works. = 1980-1990‚ÄîWilderness Series = The charcoal drawings, flower paintings and close-ups of bodies of water and plants are his latest works and have never been exhibited. At least twenty of these paintings were sold from his studio to private collectors. Robert concentrated the latter part of his life on producing works rather than exhibiting. His painting subjects came from the national parks and gardens he visited, and he approached these works as portraits rather than landscapes. The water paintings and paintings of grasses were his personal favorites‚Äîhe liked best what seemed chaotic or unorganized and then finding reason, patterns and rhythms, from a scene viewed at a park or garden. The charcoal drawings would become the ‚ÄúWilderness Series‚Äù and the themes and forms of these drawings found their way into the paintings. Robert would use turpentine to wet the paper and with a palette knife would then work with this wet medium, creating the image from the black liquid mass. (This technique was borne from an accident when he had spilled turpentine on a charcoal drawing he had been working on.) Once it dried, he would create the drawing by erasing light out of the charcoal mass. Attention to the negative spaces in a composition was a favorite theme in all of his works across media. <gallery widths=\\"200px\\" heights=\\"200px\\" class=\\"center‚Äù> File:Wild1.jpg|Wildernes No. 5 File:Wild2.jpg|Wildernes No. 11 File:Wild3.jpg|Wildernes No. 3 = 2000-2010‚ÄîFlower Portraits = He read Blake's Auguries of Innocence and felt this poem best expressed his world view, to see heaven in a wildflower. The flowers and waterscapes from the second half of his career become more representational and are from the most prosaic locations (local gardens, first in New York then Florida). Robert took great delight when viewers of his work were surprised that the subject matter was a subway ride away or around the corner. The ability to go back and see a subject he was painting at different times in different lights and also, to see the flowers and plants go through death and come alive again in the next year enchanted him. For his entire life, Robert had been an inveterate traveler. As the physical aspects of travel became too laborious, his pragmatism refocused him in his immediate surroundings for subject matter. <gallery widths=\\"200px\\" heights=\\"200px\\" class=\\"center‚Äù> File:Bougainvillea1.jpg|Bougainvillea = 1990-2010‚ÄîPhotographs = These photographic studies were used to plan the later waterscapes <gallery widths=\\"200px\\" heights=\\"200px\\" class=\\"center‚Äù> File:Coast12.jpg|coast12 File:Water lilies.jpg|water lilies  Influences  In sculpture, Robert greatly admired and was influenced by the styles of Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth, and the Cycladic period of art in Greece, as well as Constantin Brancusi and Giacometti, as he was to favor pure, essential forms. He often said that he would trade all of his possessions for the Benin court ivory mask at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Robert often referred to anatomical drawings by Vesalius when composing his works, and the themes of bones and muscles were characteristic of his sculpture. His sculpture is mindful of negative space or a minimalist perspective and this theme is pervasive in compositions in his landscapes and later flower paintings. C√©zanne‚Äôs use of perspective in composition to draw the viewer through the journey of the painting was a great influence on Robert's landscape painting technique. In painting, he admired and studied a wide range of artists. The murals of the Renaissance were constant lessons in composition that he revisited because of their skill in combining large scale work that kept the viewer engaged and the eye moving. Of this period, he greatly admired Tintoretto, Michelangelo and Raphael. Of Michelangelo, he thought of his unfinished Pieta as the most perfect expression of love and empathy, and as a technical achievement in the ability to see the evidence of the artist's journey in his chisel marks. He took many trips to Italy and Venice to see the Scuola Grande di San Rocco murals by Tintoretto. It was frequently closed for various reasons, and it took five years of visits before he could view the entire works. This was the most intimate, mysterious way to experience murals; unlike other great mural works, the scuola San Rocco is hard to find, is always dim light at best, but the viewer is rewarded with a spectacular narrative of Christ's life. For Robert, this was Christ painted to be accessible by Everyman. This is how he interpreted the somewhat less finished aspect of these murals. Tintoretto, like Robert and like Modigliani were outsiders. His all around favorite painter in terms of skill, vision and humanism was Turner who was for landscapes as Rembrandt was for portraits. Rembrandt self portrait represented for Robert what his goals were as an artist: first an unflinching representation of what was beautiful in painting, and as with Michelangelo the hand of the artist is evident in the brush strokes as well as the thought process. Robert made museum guards very nervous in always going as close to a work as he could to see details of the work. Van der Weyden's Portrait of a Lady was the first work he would look for at the National Gallery, and thought the work transcended portraiture. Hiroshige and his multiple views and perspectives influenced Robert in his preliminary studies for painting. Chinese landscape drawings were a constant source of inspiration. He was most drawn by the synthesis of the artist's internal monologue and the depiction of the subject, and these were great examples of spiritual and intellectual unity. A very happy day for him came when the Met opened the Brook Astor Chinese court. Robert Mapplethorpe and Andy Warhol were, for Robert, highly original and always compelling. In particular, Mapplethorpe's images of decaying flowers were of great interest, the idea that decaying dying things could be so beautiful, so spiritual. Regarding Warhol, early on Robert thought Warhol was important and original and made a point of keeping up with his work. Robert had an enormous range as an artist and mastered the technical aspects of many media. He loved the challenge of mastering a particular style and the intellectual skills brought to bear. His classical training and art history studies gave him an extensive artistic vocabulary that allowed him to articulate his visions.  Technical Virtuosity  Relative to his peers, Robert seldom employed studio assistants and when he did, for limited purposes. He was well versed on technical aspects of creating art and he stretched and primed his own canvases and mixed his paints from dry pigment. He worked primarily in oil for painting and charcoal for drawings. In addition to his oil and acrylic paintings, Robert's works in pastel, water color, tempera and wood canvas are still in excellent un-restored condition. The same holds true for his approach to sculpture; works are mostly in marble and granite and small figures in jade and serpentine. He would begin a painting with gesture drawings, blocking out the large movements and composition. Paintings started as cartoons, followed by the primer color which was often cerulean‚Äîthe base color beneath the snapdragons, or alizarin crimson for the gladioli.

History The Windhover's maiden voyage was from Glasgow, Scotland to Liverpool, Britain in 1868. In 1870, the Windhover carried 1,064,645 lbs of tea from Foo Chow, China to London in 99 days, the best achieved that year before the monsoon changed direction (but bettered only by Lahloo and Leander with 98 days). The races of tea clippers from China had changed since The Great Tea Race of 1866 - a monetary prize (\\"the premium\\") was no longer included in the bill of lading of a tea clipper and the winner was judged to be the ship with the fastest passage, rather than the first to dock in London. After the opening of the Suez Canal in 1870, clipper ships were replaced with faster steamships in the transport of tea and other cargo. Most were used in the Australian wool trade. The Windhover traveled regularly to China, sailing to Shanghai, Foo-Chow, Yokohama and Hong Kong. She was bought by Kerr & Co in 1881 and altered to a barque rig while working the Australian trade routes, hauling coal from western Australia to the eastern cities.

Wheaton (1812-1903) was an American farmer, teacher, legislator, businessman, philanthropist, and benefactor and namesake of Wheaton College and Wheaton, Illinois. Early life Warren Lyon Wheaton was born in Pomfret, Connecticut on March 6, 1812 to James and Nancy Lyon Wheaton, both natives of New England. Wheaton's family was descended from Reformed Baptist Puritans from the United Kingdom, who helped found the First Baptist Church in Massachusetts and who were sympathetic to Roger Williams. Wheaton's grandfather, James Wheaton, lived in Providence, Rhode Island and fought in the Revolutionary War. Warren Wheaton was the eldest of thirteen children. He attended the Woodstock Academy in Woodstock, Connecticut and became a school teacher after attending the academy for a-year-and-a-half. He also served in the local militia.Green's Connecticut Annual Register and United States Calendar (Samuel Green, 1832) pg. 93Newton Bateman, Paul Selby, Historical encyclopedia of Illinois, Volume 2, (Munsell Pub. Co., 1913) pg. 1074-1075Portrait and Biographical Record of Cook and Dupage Counties, Illinois ...(Lake City Publishing Company, 1894), pg. 120 Move to West After hearing about the fertile farmland in Illinois from Erastus Gary, Wheaton visited there in 1837 and returned permanently in 1838, followed by his brother, Jesse Childs Wheaton. While staying with Erastus Gary in Illinois, Wheaton experienced a conversion to Christianity, as did his brother, Jesse, and they both eventually became members of the Methodist church. Warren Wheaton then started farming in Du Page County, Illinois after receiving some government land there, laying claim to of land in the center of town. Jesse Childs Wheaton later made claim to of land just west of Warren's. Other settlers from New England soon joined the Wheaton settlement. In 1850, ten blocks of land were platted and anyone who was willing to build immediately was granted free land. In 1853, the lots were surveyed and a formal plat for the city was filed with the county. The city was then incorporated in 1859 with Warren serving as its first President. In 1848 Warren Wheaton married Harriet E. Rickard (1826-1863) of Pomfret, Connecticut and had six children before she died after giving birth to their last child in 1863. Warren Lyon Wheaton married a second time, to Christiana Shugg on 4 April 1877 in Manhattan, New York City. Christiana Shugg was born on 31 December 1816 and baptised on 19 January 1817, in Helston, Cornwall, England. Her parents were William Shugg (1791-1856), a miller, and Elizabeth Williams (c.1789-1862).Helston Parish Records The Shugg family emigrated from Cornwall to North America on the ship, 'Margaret Evans' docking on 21 November 1846, at New York City Port. Prior to her marriage, Christiana Shugg was a milliner and business-woman, advertising her shop on Fifth Avenue in the New York Times. After twenty years of marriage, Christiana Wheaton died in 1899. Buried in Wheaton Cemetery, DuPage, Illinois, her gravestone memorial reads: Christiana Shugg Wheaton 1818-1899. Warren L. Wheaton was later buried beside her. Christiana's obituary (pub. Friday 8 Sept 1899) noted 'Her parents were members of the Baptist church and reared their children in the habits of prayer and the study of God's word,' and 'when twenty-three or twenty-four years of age she came to New York where for many years she made her home.' ...

They teamed with Warren Wheaton and his wife Harriet to undertake secret network duties. To conceal runaways, the Wheatons equipped their house with a secret attic-within-an- attic. In addition to laying out the city of Wheaton, they supported an abolitionist Wesleyan church.

Philanthropy He donated land and funds to various churches and civic organizations, including land for a Methodist church, land for a new courthouse, a railroad right-of-way, and large donations of land and cash to Wheaton College, which was named in his honor. He also made large donations to the Aurora Institute, Clark Seminary, and Evanston College. Wheaton also helped form the Mutual Security Company of Wheaton and contributed to the Milwaukee, Galena and Chicago Telegraph Company.

Facts Edward Ward 7th Baron Dudley and 2nd Baron Ward leased for 99 years real property in trust for himself for his life, then in trust to pay out of the rents, issues, and profits as annuities for his grandchildren (Edward Ward (the plaintive's father), son and heir of William Ward, eldest son of the 7th Baron Dudley; and William Ward, son of Ferdinando Dudley Ward second son of the seventh Baron Dudley); and to the grandchildren to 7th Baron Dudley's brother, William Ward, (Frances Porter and Catherine Porter). The remainder of the lease was in trust to the 7th Baron Dudley and heirs of his body male. The annuities arose on the death of the 7th Baron Dudley. The seventh Baron Dudley died on 28 June 1701. Edward Ward a minor, (the plaintive's father) succeeded as the 8th Baron Dudley and 3rd Baron Ward, since his father predeceased the 7th Baron Dudley and received his annuity and the remainder of the lease in trust. The 8th Baron Dudley married Diana Howard, the defendant. The 8th Baron Dudley died on 20 March 1704 while his wife, Lady Diana was pregnant. On 16 June 1704 Lady Diana gave birth to Edward Ward, 9th Baron Dudley and fourth Baron Ward, the plaintive. Lady Diana brought a Writ of Dower at law that was granted but stayed enforcement because of the lease. This bill was filed by the Honorable Thomas Newport on behalf of the 9th Baron Dudley for administration the will of his father and great- grandfather. Lady Diana filed a cross bill demanding one third of the surplus of the lease after the payment of the annuities as her dower.  Holding  \\"[T]he right of a dowress to her dower is not only a legal right, so adjudged at law, but is also a moral right, to be provided for, and to have a maintenance and sustenance out of her husband's estate to live upon; she is therefore in the care of the law, and a favourite of the law; and upon this moral law is the law of England founded, as to the right of dower.\\" \\"[A] marriage is as much a contract (and I am sure more sacred) and ought to be as much regarded and relieved, as a defective jointure.\\" The lady dowager has as her dower the benefit of this trust term, and that the trustees do account to her for the third part of the clear profits above the charge of any yearly annuities, from the death of her husband and from time to time for the future during the term, and the term to stand charged therewith during her life. \\"[F]or what are the profits, but the lands, or what is the land, but the profits?\\" Nature of Equity \\"Equity is no part of the law, but a moral virtue, which qualifies, moderates, and reforms the rigour, hardness and edge of the law, and is a universal truth. It does also assist the law, where it is defective and weak in the constitution (which is the life of the law), and defends the law from crafty evasions, delusions and mere subtleties, invented and contrived to evade and elude the common law, whereby such as have undoubted right are made remediless. And thus is the office of equity to protect and support the common law from shifts and contrivances against the justice of the law. Equity, therefore, does not destroy the law, nor create it, but assists it. \\" ReferencesExternal links Court of Chancery cases English property case law English trusts case law 1705 in law 1705 in England Equity (law) ","title":"Dudley v Dudley"},{"id":"38545901","text":"Richard Genzer (born 20 December 1966) is a Czech actor, dancer, singer, TV host and comedian.

Most of the victims were members of the predominantly Shia Twelver ethnic Hazara community, and authorities expected the death toll to rise due to the large number of serious injuries. The Lashkar-e-Jhangvi group claimed responsibility for the blast, the second major attack against the Shia Hazaras in a month. As of 19 February, one of the masterminds of the attack has been arrested and taken into custody along with 170 suspects, and four high-profile militants accused of killing Shia civilians were killed during an operation by security forces. Weapons, ammunition and bomb-making material were seized by security officials during the operation. As the Hazara people's Genocide is going on since more than One decade none of the sunni extremists has been brought to Justice. Background Acts of violence involving Sunni Muslims and their Shia counterparts in Pakistan have been evident since the 1980s. They are generally considered to have arisen from attempts by the then national leader, Zia ul-Haq, to legitimise his military dictatorship and from the influx of weapons into the country following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Although the perpetrators often do not claim responsibility for the attacks, expert analysis suggests that in recent times it is the Sunnis who are dominating the aggression and that they are motivated by the ideology of Al Qaeda. The number of violent incidents has been increasing in recent years, although not all of them are classified by the police as being sectarian attacks. Quetta, which is the capital of the Pakistani province of Balochistan, has seen numerous of these violent incidents. This is in part because of a separatist movement involving militants from the Balochistan Liberation Army who desire greater autonomy and also because the Pakistani military is engaged in counter-insurgency operations near to the province's border with Afghanistan, where there is tribal strife that involves the Taliban and allied groups. Similarly, the January 2013 Pakistan bombings in Quetta led to nearly 120 deaths and caused widespread anger leading to the dismissal of the provincial government. Bombing The bomb went off in a market area with many grocery stores, several language schools and a large computer centre. It took place towards the end of the market day, as many people shopped for food and children left school. According to Quetta's police chief Mir Zubai Mehmood, around 70‚Äì80 kg of explosives had been planted inside a water tank that had been installed on a tractor trailer. Initial reports suggested the bomb had been attached to a parked motorbike. The blast dealt severe damage to buildings in the area, destroying at least one two-story house and trapping many under rubble. Sporadic gunfire was reported after the attack, and locals were reportedly hesitant to approach the site in the immediate aftermath for fear of more bombs. Angry members of the Hazara minority set up roadblocks with burning tires and fired into the air in order to keep people away from the blast site in case of a second attack. Photos from the scene showed groups of desperate people rushing the injured into ambulances and private vehicles, as emergency services quickly became overloaded. Nevertheless, police forces worked throughout the evening and into the night, with the death toll being updated several times due to more bodies being pulled out from beneath rubble. Perpetrator It is expected that the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Sunni Muslim extremist militant group, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ), is behind the attacks on the Hazara minority in the region. There are differences of opinion regarding whether LeJ is a breakaway group of a banned former political party, Sipah-e-Sahaba, or is its armed wing. The LeJ openly issues death threats to Hazaras through newspaper ads and describes them as wajib-ul-qatl (deserving of death). Reactions=Domestic reactions= Immediately after the attack, Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf both released statements strongly condemning the bombing, while vowing to go after the perpetrators. Hazara leaders refused to bury their dead, giving a 48-hour ultimatum to the government to launch an operation and also demanded handing over the city to the Army. Protests were held countrywide in the aftermath of the blast, with about 1500 marchers reported on the streets of Lahore and protests in Muzaffarabad and Multan. Zulfikar Ali Magsi, the Governor of Balochistan Province, criticized Pakistan's security forces regarding the violence, stating. \\"Our security institutions, police, FC and others are either scared or cannot take action against them\\". During a Senate session in Islamabad, numerous lawmakers staged a walkout to protest the government's failure in addressing the \\"root causes\\" of terror. The Shia Ulema Council of Pakistan observed a strike in Karachi through a peaceful sit-in. Political parties, including the Pakistan Muslim League (N), Muttahida Qaumi Movement and Majlis-e-Wahdat-e-Muslimeen among others raised the incompetency of the government and called for swift action to be taken. On his official Twitter account, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf chairman Imran Khan expressed being \\"disturbed and saddened\\" by the killings and strongly condemned the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, demanding the LeJ culprits who were behind the attack be punished, while adding that members of his party would hold protests to express solidarity with the Hazara people. The Supreme Court of Pakistan took suo moto notice of the incident on 18 February and scheduled an open hearing the following day, in which the Balochistan Advocate General and Attorney General of Pakistan would be summoned. At the hearing, Chief Justice of Pakistan Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry remarked that an operation should have been conducted against the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi a long time ago. While pointing to the failure of intelligence agencies, Chaudhry also questioned how the attacks had taken place despite the heavy presence of Frontier Corps in Quetta. =International reactions= The Foreign Minister of Iran, Ali Akbar Salehi, also denounced the attack, and called it a \\"criminal act which only serves the interest of the enemies of the Pakistani nation.\\" United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon strongly condemned the blast and called for \\"swift and determined action against those claiming responsibility and perpetrating such actions\\" while reiterating \\"strong support\\" from the United Nations for \\"efforts by the Government and people of Pakistan to protect religious and ethnic minorities and to combat the scourge of terrorism.\\" =Crackdown against Lashkar-e-Jhangvi= Prime Minister Raja Pervaiz Ashraf announced a \\"targeted operation\\" in Quetta aimed against the culprits. Ashraf also removed the Inspector general of Balochistan Umer Khitab from his post. A six-man parliamentary group arrived in Quetta to inspect the post-attack situation and hold talks with the affected Hazara community. On 19 February, security forces killed four high-profile targets accused of killing Shia civilians and arrested 170 suspects during an operation. Among the arrested men was one of the masterminds of the Hazara Town attack.

He participated in all Greek wars of the early 20th century, served as effective Chief of the Hellenic Army General Staff in 1928‚Äì1929, General Secretary of the newly established Aviation Ministry in 1930‚Äì1934, and briefly as General-Governor of Northern Greece and Minister of Military Affairs in 1945.  Biography  Alexandros Merentitis was born in Thebes in 1880. He enrolled in the Hellenic Army Academy and graduated on 6 July 1902 as an Artillery 2nd Lieutenant. In 1908, he participated in the last stages of the Macedonian Struggle, under the nom de guerre of \\"Doukas\\". While serving as a secretary in the Greek consulate at Manastir, he was arrested by the Ottoman authorities and spent a time in prison. In the same year, he was promoted to lieutenant, and participated in both Balkan Wars of 1912‚Äì1913 as a battery commander, fighting in both Epirus and Macedonia. After the Balkan Wars, he was promoted to captain (1913) and assigned to teach geography at the Army Academy. Merentitis was promoted to major in 1915, and after Greece's entry in World War I in 1917, to lieutenant colonel. During the war he served as artillery commander of the 4th Infantry Division on the Macedonian front. He continued in the same post in the 2nd Infantry Division during the Greek participation in the Allied intervention in the Ukraine against the Bolsheviks. He was promoted to full colonel in the same year (1919). After the end of the Allied campaign, he was transferred to Anatolia, where Greece was engaged in a war with the Turkish Nationalist forces of Mustafa Kemal. He served throughout the Greco-Turkish War of 1919‚Äì1922, first as artillery commander of II Army Corps and then as artillery commander of I Army Corps. On 24 June 1922, shortly before the decisive Turkish offensive in August, he was also placed as chief of staff of I Corps. After the collapse of the Greek front and evacuation from Anatolia, Merentitis was suspended from active service. In 1925 he returned to service, was promoted to major general and appointed as Artillery Inspector of the Army, and studied in the French Army Artillery School at Metz. On his return, he was appointed deputy chief of the Hellenic Army General Staff (29 October 1928 ‚Äì 17 October 1929); however, as the post of the chief was vacant during this period, he was the effective head of the Army. In 1930 he was appointed General Secretary of the newly established Aviation Ministry, from which post he retired in 1934. In 1945, he served as Minister General-Governor of Northern Greece in the first cabinet of Admiral Petros Voulgaris (16 April ‚Äì 11 August), and as Minister for Military Affairs in Voulgaris' second cabinet (22 August ‚Äì 17 October), and in the cabinet of Archbishop Damaskinos of Athens (17 October ‚Äì 1 November). In the latter he also served as Minister for Naval Affairs from 19 October. He was unmarried, and died in 1964.

A banda sul palco (band on the stage) was prominently used in Rossini's Neapolitan operas.Gossett, Philip (2008). Divas and Scholars: Performing Italian Opera, p. 607. University of Chicago Press Verdi used the term banda to refer to a banda sul palco, as in the score for Rigoletto. He used the term banda interna (internal band), to refer to a band which is still separate from the orchestra but heard from the off-stage wings. The early scores of La traviata use a banda interna.Jackson, Roland John (2005). Performance Practice: A Dictionary- Guide for Musicians, p. 434. Routledge Origins Diegetic depictions of music making are present in the earliest operatic depictions of Orpheus accompanying himself but larger onstage ensembles seem to have first appeared in Don Giovanni, most spectacularly in the polymetric Act I ball where the wind Harmonie is joined by two violin-and-bass bands to simultaneously accompany minuet, contradance and waltz. Giovanni Paisiello's opera Pirro, which opened weeks later in December 1787, marks the first use of the term banda in the sense of a wind band. While Almaviva's serenade is accompanied from the pit in both Paisiello's (1782) and Rossini's (1816) Il barbiere di Siviglia, by 1818 Rossini's opera Ricciardo e Zoraide the banda was established as an independent institution in Italian opera houses.Julian Budden: Stage band, in Organisation of the banda Composers such as Rossini and Verdi made use of the banda. Composers wrote music on two staves, and the bandmaster added clarinets in the upper register and brass in the middle and lower. At the Paris Opera in the mid-nineteenth century, Adolphe Sax used only brass instruments, many of them saxhorns. The banda was much like a military band. It comprised about twenty players, but was generally not part of the opera company - usually, the local impresario selected the players. In Palermo, Bourbon troops were recruited for operas, and, in Venice, Kinsky's Austrian army regiment, in a similar capacity, was highly regarded.Banda, in Verdi and the banda According to Warrack and West, the banda \\"makes its most marked appearance in Verdi's operas, where its stirring, frankly vulgar sound accorded well with the general Risorgimento feeling of such early works as Nabucco and I Lombardi. In his later operas he used the banda convention in a more flexible fashion, ranging from the subtlety of the ballroom scenes in Rigoletto and Un ballo in maschera to the stridency of the auto-da-f√© scene of Don Carlos.\\" Julian Budden, dismissing Rossini's use of the banda as \\"always naturalistic and perfunctory\\", continues by dismissing Donizetti's and Bellini's banda music, and finally writes \\"It was left to Verdi to plumb the depths of vulgarity with his banda marches, even at a time when his style as a whole had reformed. .... The so-called Kinsky band at Venice had a very high reputation, and Verdi, who had refused to write for it in Attila, took good care to include it in all his subsequent Venetian operas\\".

His debut as independent director commenced with the film, Aah, in 1953, produced by Raj Kapoor, which, at the time, did not quite make its mark at the box-office. However, the songs and music of the film are considered classics of Indian cinema. Subsequently, the film was dubbed in Tamil and Telugu. Raja Nawathe's next directorial venture in 1956, Basant Bahar, was a musical success. This film received the \\"Certificate of Merit for Best Feature Film in Hindi\\", a National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi.

Meanwhile, Sultan Husayn Mirza Bayqarah had mustered a force of 1,000 men and had taken Jurjan on October 19, 1458, from Kara Koyunlu. Sultan Husayn Mirza was just 20 years old. Abu Sa'id Mirza invaded Jurjan which Sultan Husayn Mirza hastily abandoned and fled towards Khwarazm again. Abu Sa'id Mirza appointed his son Sultan Mahmud Mirza as Jurjan's governor. Around 1459‚Äì60, Juki Mirza received aid from Abul-Khayr Khan and his wife (a daughter of Ulugh Beg), an Uzbek army under Burke Sultan was sent in his support. Some of the late Ulugh Beg's troops also joined Juki Mirza. Before Abu Sa'id Mirza could join his army it was defeated and Juki Mirza advanced as far as Kufin. From there he invaded the Transoxiana up to Amu Darya. Abu Sa'id Mirza received intelligence of this and marched with his army out of Herat to face this threat. When Sultan Husayn Mirza Bayqarah learned that Abu Sa'id Mirza had left Herat to crush the rebellion of his relative Juki Mirza, he attacked Jurjan again and at the Battle of Jauzi Wali in May, 1461 he defeated Sultan Mahmud Mirza and appointed Abdal-Rahman Arghun the territory's governor.

William was the fifth child born to George Colfax (born: December 25, 1727) and Lucy Avery (married April 13, 1749), who had a total of ten children. Colfax was about 5'-10\\" tall and weighed about 190-200 lbs. He had blue eyes, dark hair, and was clean shaven. His hair was powdered and worn in a queue, tied with a black ribbon, till his later years. He was married to Hester Schuyler, cousin of Philip Schuyler, of Pompton on August 27, 1783, together they had six children. Together they lived in Hester's inherited Schuyler-Colfax House in Wayne, New Jersey, which today is a museum. Their grandson was Schuyler Colfax, the 17th Vice President of the United States. Military career When Colfax was 17 years old, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Continental Army leading him to be present at the Battle of Bunker Hill in 1775. Colfax was wounded three times in battle during the war, one of those times was at the Battle of White Plains in October 1776. Another was on July 3, 1781, four miles from Valentine's Hill north of New York City near Kingsbridge. Upon one occasion, when he was in the act of giving the word of command to his men, a bullet struck his uplifted sword, shattering the blade, and glancing, skinned one of his fingers. On another occasion, also while riding on horseback in an exposed position a bullet was sent through his body, just above the hip and below the bowels, entering in front and coming out behind. The long buff waistcoat he wore at the time is preserved by his grandchildren, and the hole is apparent, made by the almost fatal shot. In the excitement of the battle the Colfax did not notice the wound, but still galloped from point to point over the field delivering orders. Some Hessian soldiers, who had been taken prisoners, saw the blood streaming from his side and into his boot, and gleefully exclaimed, \\"Mein Gott! de Captain is wounded again.\\" As he kept on in the fight some of his own men saw the blood flow and cried to him, \\"Captain! the blood is running out of your boot!\\" Looking down, he noticed his condition for the first time and recognized that it must be serious, and rode over toward the field hospital. Dr. Ledyard looked at the wound and bade him go at once into the hospital, and stay in, the latter order being needed to keep Colfax indoors. The excitement over, the wounded Colfax succumbed to the loss of blood and grew faint and weak as a child. After hurriedly examining and dressing the injury, Dr. Ledyard subsequently asked, \\"Do you want to be cured quickly, or to let this thing linger along?\\" To which the Captain replied, \\"As quickly as possible.\\" The surgeon promptly applied the bistouri, tore tho wound open and dressed it, whereupon it soon healed. However, recovery was attended by an eruption of boils, covering Colfax from head to heels. Washington, seeing the state of his captain, told him, \\"You are in a deplorable condition; I will give you a furlough that you may go home till you recover.\\" Colfax persisted in staying with the army till they went into winter quarters at Morristown, in the winter of 1779‚Äì1780. During that season he went home to Connecticut on horseback through snow in March so deep that he rode over the fence-tops. He returned greatly improved in health, and was with the army till the close of the war. American Revolution While the American army was encamped at Valley Forge, Washington issued an order, dated March 17, 1778, directing that \\"one hundred chosen men are to be annexed to the Guard of the Commander in-Chief, for the purpose of forming a corps, to be instructed in the manoeuvres necessary to be introduced into the Army, and to serve as a model for the execution of them.\\" Colfax succeeded Caleb Gibbs on January 1, 1781, as captain (by Washington's appointment) of his Life Guard until September 5, 1783, having gone on furlough in July. During his service in the Life Guard, Colfax was promoted from second lieutenant to first lieutenant, and then finally to captain in April 1783. Colfax was present at the Surrender of Lord Cornwallis, at Yorktown and permitted by Washington to occupy a prominent position, on horseback, near Washington. According to Connecticut records, he served in the Continental Army until January 1, 1780. Colfax retired from the army on November 3, 1783. He was appointed by the legislature to be a Justice of the Peace for the Court of Common Pleas of Bergen County for many years. He served in the New Jersey legislature from 1806‚Äì13, in the General Assembly (1806, 07, 09, 10, and 11) and the Legislative Council (1808, 12, and 13). In 1811 he was Brigadier-General of the Second Division of Infantry, Bergen Brigade where in the War of 1812 he had a command at Sandy Hook. Death William Colfax died after couple days of illness on September 9, 1838. The services were held in the Reformed Dutch Church at Pompton and were led by Reverend Isaac S. Demarest. He received full military honors, the Militia of Paterson and the whole town showed up. General Abraham Godwin and Colonel Cornelius G. Garrison commanded the martial music.

The root cause of the ZLB is the issuance of paper currency by governments, effectively guaranteeing a zero nominal interest rate and acting as an interest rate floor. Governments cannot encourage spending by lowering interest rates, because people would simply hold cash instead. Miles Kimball suggested that a modern economy either fully relying on electronic money or defining electronic money as the unit of account could eliminate the ZLB.18 Misconceptions about Eliminating the Zero Lower Bound Even without such measures, however, several central banks are able to reduce interest rates below zero; for example, the Czech National Bank estimates that the lower limit on its interest rate is below -1%. The problem of the ZLB returned to prominence with Japan's experience during the 90's, and more recently with the subprime crisis. The belief that monetary policy under the ZLB was effective in promoting economy growth has been critiqued by Paul Krugman, Gauti Eggertsson, and Michael Woodford among others. Milton Friedman, on the other hand, argued that a zero nominal interest rate presents no problem for monetary policy. According to Friedman, a central bank can increase the monetary base even if the interest rate vanishes; it only needs to continue buying bonds.Milton Friedman's Keynote address at the Bank of Canada Friedman also coined the term \\"helicopter drops\\" to illustrate how central banks could always generate spending and inflation. Friedman used the example of a helicopter flying over a town dropping dollar bills from the sky, which households then gathered in perfectly equal shares. Economists have argued that real-world versions of this idea would work at the zero lower bound. Typically, helicopter drops have been interpreted as involving the central bank directly financing the budget deficit. The economist Willem Buiter has argued that helicopter drops can always raise demand and inflation.Buiter, W. The Simple Analytics of Helicopter Money Following the repeated struggles of the European Central Bank to revive the Eurozone economy and meet its inflation objective, a number of economists have taken a more literal interpretation of Friedman's parable and suggested that the European Central Bank should transfer cash directly to households.Print Less, but Transfer More, Foreign Affairs, Blyth, M., Lonergan, E See also * Negative interest on excess reserves * Negative interest rate * Zero interest-rate policy ReferencesExternal links *Keister, Todd (November 16, 2011).

The tersorium was shared by people using public latrines. To clean the sponge, they simply washed it in a bucket with water and salt or vinegar. This became a breeding ground for bacteria, causing the spread of disease in the latrine. In classical antiquity a xylospongium might be used as a toilet brush.Wiplinger 2012, S. 300-301.

He created a notable collection of antiquities including the Barberini Venus. Origins He was born on 13 May 1736 as \\"William Elcock\\", the son and heir of Richard Elcock (d.1762) (who later adopted the surname of Weddell in lieu of his patronymic), later of Newby Hall, which he purchased in 1748. His great-uncle was Thomas Weddell of Earswick, Paymaster to the Navy, who made a large fortune during the South Sea Bubble. Career He was educated at Dr. Newcome's Academy in Hackney, and later at St. John‚Äôs College, Cambridge (1753), at the expense of his great-uncle Thomas Weddell, who bequeathed his fortune to Richard Elcock on condition that he and William should change their surnames to Weddell. He trained as a lawyer at Gray's Inn in 1753. In 1762 whilst on the Grand Tour, William Weddell became heir to his father, his elder brother having died. William was thus in a position to start what became a renowned collection of classical antiquities, including the Barberini Venus, which sold in 2002 for ¬£8 million. He upgraded and extended Newby Hall to house his collection. He was elected a Member of Parliament for Kingston upon Hull in 1766, sitting until 1774. He was elected for Malton in 1775, serving until 1784, and again in 1784, serving until 1792.

The southern part area of Gibraltar was already protected, however the north lacked a strong artillery that could protect its position, which is why the military advised that half a league from the battery, a detachment with 4 to 24 cannons should be added. The building had two rectangular bastions for protection and were parallel to the ground near the beach, which was protected by a shoulder. The battery could house an infantry garrison of fifteen men and one officer, six gunners and a corporal, as well as four men and a corporal of the cavalry.

Abdul Bokar Kan was the head of the Booseya clan of Futa Toro. He formed an alliance with Muhammad wul Hayba, the head of the AwlƒÅd A'li of the Gorgol region. The almami of Futa Toro at that time was Abdul Boubakar, but his power was nominal. In June 1864 the Moors and Booseya Fula collaborated in plundering trade barges that had become stranded near Sald√©, drawing savage French reprisals against both groups. After Amadu Toro died, the lower part of Futa Toro was safe for French river traffic. Abdul Bokar Kan was the de facto ruler of the upper Futa. He had eliminated Tierno Brahin, one of his rivals, in 1869. The Wan family, led by Ibra Almami, rivalled his power in the lower part of Futa Toro, but in the upper part he had gained full power. The French generally encouraged Abdul Bokar Kan and other Futa Toro strongmen when they attacked caravans in the region, since they hoped that would discourage migration away from the region to Kaarta. Under growing pressure from the French colonial power in Senegambia, Abdul Bokar Kan did what he could to protect his land, income and power in Futa Toro through diplomatic means. In 1890 the French military embarked on a campaign to eliminate the last remaining autonomous states. Abdul Bokar fled, but was assassinated by the Moors.

They were the sons of Josse Beyens.  The origins  The family Beyens had many connexions with the parish church of St Bartholomew in Merksem. In its archives are to be found some members of the family Beyens. In the 17th century appears Lucia Beyens, married to Thomas Bogaerts. They wrote their wills on 5 May 1653. There was also Joannes Beyens, who was sacristan and schoolmaster between 1673 and 1695. Also Joos Beyens, who between 1681 and 1703 exercised the craft of cartwright. Josef Beyens was baptized on the 17th of April 1639 in the parish church of Merksem. He was the son of Juan Beyens and Petronela van Beren. The 19th of July 1662 he married Anna Torrekens in Wijnegem and they had three children: Anna, Jos√© en Cornelio Beyens. Josef Beyens died on the 8th of februari 1698 in Merksem.  Great merchants in Cadiz  Cornelio Beyens was born in Merksem in 1672 and died in C√°diz in 1736 or 1737. In 1693 he left Flanders and lived for two years in Madrid. He had previously been in contact with the merchant family Huwijn in Bruges, of whom one was established in Cadiz. In 1695 he moved to C√°diz. On the 3rd of May 1699 he married Mar√≠a Bruggemans in C√°diz. Cornelio Beyens and also his elder brother Josse, were established as merchants in Cadiz and became rapidly amongst the most prosperous families of this town. Cornelio was Consul of the Flemish Nation in Cadiz.  Entry into nobility  His sons Lorenzo, Rafael and Alejandro Beyens saw their nobility \\"recognized\\" by the Royal Chancellery of Grenade on August 8, 1766, based on the presentation of a false genealogy approved by the heraldry services in Brussels, making them the descendants of the noble family Beyens de Grambais.Wout Van Putten, De familie Beyens, een Vlaams-Gaditaanse handelaarsfamilie in de 18de eeuw, p. 67 : \\"The king of Spain, Fernando VI approved that the family Beyens-Bruggemans was of noble extraction, within and outside Spain. This was based upon an affidavit given in Brabant on the 21st of december 1754, by the Cuatro Reyes de Armas, a public body dealing with the recognition of coats of arms. This was approved, seven days later, by the 'Conseil d'Etat' in Brussels. Several members of the Beyens de Grambais family had exercised noble professions and this was usurped by the descendants of the modest Beyens of Merxem. The kings of arms in Brussels were notoriously open to receiving bribes for confirmation of falsified genealogies. The genealogist and hoaxer Charles Poplimont also made from them the descendants of the noble family Beyens de Grambais. But sons of a noble family of militaries and high civil servants could not become simple merchants. The archives of Merxem give the more humble origins of this family. On 3 December 1773, Charles III of Spain granted Lorenzo the hereditary titles of Count of Villamar and Viscount of San Lorenzo. Five years later, Lorenzo Beyens reached an important political situation by becoming Sindico Personero, that is to say ‚Äúrepresentative of the people‚Äù of the town of Cadiz and on July 14, 1779, he was admitted in the Order of Charles III. Being given the social status which they had reached, the Beyens had to give up their lucrative commercial activities. Lorenzo Josef and Josef Maria, sons of Lorenzo Beyens, thus became officers in the Walloon Guards, a popular regiment among Flemish √©migr√©s established in Spain. This branch of the Beyens family remained in Cadiz and gave soldiers and engineers until the 20th century.

Work on the monument began in 1901 and it was dedicated in 1903.  History and description The monument was erected to honor Admiral George Dewey, a hero of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, for his victory in the Battle of Manila Bay. On May 23, 1901, President William McKinley visited San Francisco to break ground for the monument. Six months later McKinley was assassinated and was succeeded by his vice president, Theodore Roosevelt. On May 14, 1903, Roosevelt officially dedicated the monument, which \\"commemorates the victory of Admiral George Dewey and the American fleet over Spanish forces at Manila Bay, the Philippines, on May 1, 1898, during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War\\" and also is a tribute to the sailors of the United States Navy. Robert Ingersoll Aitken was hired to sculpt a statue representing Nike, the ancient Greek Goddess of Victory in honor of McKinley and Dewey. The statue holds a trident that represents Dewey and a wreath that represents McKinley. Legend holds that Aitken hired Alma de Bretteville Spreckels to model for the statue, but a 1902 article detailing the monument's construction stated that Aitken's model was Clara Petzold, who later became a noted photographer.Staff (January 24, 1902) \\"Graceful Figure Modeled in Clay\\" San Francisco Chronicle, p. 12.

Both Mart√≠n and Meditations on the South Valley are written predominantly in first person past tense. = Mart√≠n = Mart√≠n is a narrative poem, following the retrospective first-person reflections of narrator Mart√≠n as he searches for his identity within the context of his ethnic and parental background. Mart√≠n was abandoned by his parents as a boy, lived with his grandmother, and was sent to an orphanage from which he ran away at age 10.Denise Levertov, Introduction, Mart√≠n & Meditations on the South Valley, New York, New Directions Publishing Corporation, p. xiii,xiv He lives as a drifter and explores the stories of his parents in VI & VII addressing both his mother and father directly through the use of the second person.Denise Levertov, Introduction, Mart√≠n & Meditations on the South Valley, New York, New Directions Publishing Corporation, p. xiv Mart√≠n initially regains sight of his dream \\"to buy a house, / a small piece of land, / and marry a woman\\" but drifts from city to city, until finally remembering his dream again, returning then to his hometown of Burque where he falls in love with a woman, Gabriela, and builds a home for them in the South Barrio.Jimmy Santiago Baca, Mart√≠n & Meditations on the South Valley, New York, New Directions Publishing Corporation, pp. 36,41 In the final poem of Mart√≠n, Gabriela gives birth to a son, Pablo, whom Mart√≠n promises never to abandon as was done to him.Jimmy Santiago Baca, Mart√≠n & Meditations on the South Valley, New York, New Directions Publishing Corporation, p.49 = Meditations on the South Valley = Meditations on the South Valley begins where Mart√≠n left off, though it may also be considered an autonomous work.Denise Levertov, Introduction, Mart√≠n & Meditations on the South Valley, New York, New Directions Publishing Corporation, p. xv In the first poem, Mart√≠n's home and 10 years worth of his poetry are destroyed by fire and his family is forced to relocate to an apartment in the \\"Heights\\", a more affluent area than the South Barrio.Jimmy Santiago Baca, Mart√≠n & Meditations on the South Valley, New York, New Directions Publishing Corporation, p.55 While in the Heights, Mart√≠n expresses his frustration with living in an area which values \\"newness\\" over \\"age and durability\\" saying he \\"could not bear a life / with everything perfect\\".Jimmy Santiago Baca, Mart√≠n & Meditations on the South Valley, New York, New Directions Publishing Corporation, p.59-60 The difference between Mart√≠n and Meditations on the South Valley becomes more apparent when in IX of Meditations, the narrator shifts focus and begins to tell the stories of fellow Chicanos of the South Barrio. Though a few poems in Meditations on the South Valley seem to stray from Mart√≠n's main narrative, shown in Mart√≠n, the focus of these seemingly extra-narrative stories is always on life in the barrio. What this means, Levoto explains, is that while poems are autonomous from the narrative of the work as a whole, they \\"are never detached from that wholeness of view which results from an artist's dedicated engagement with experience\\".Denise Levertov, Introduction, Mart√≠n & Meditations on the South Valley, New York, New Directions Publishing Corporation, p. xvi The collection closes by returning attention to the narrative of Mart√≠n as he rebuilds his house in the same place it had burned down. Baca uses the metaphor of the reconstructed house to illustrate Mart√≠n's persistence in rebuilding his life, in defining his identity, and in realizing his lifelong dream of familial love.Jimmy Santiago Baca, Mart√≠n & Meditations on the South Valley, New York, New Directions Publishing Corporation, p.100 Levertov calls the reconstruction \\"a miniature epic\\" and \\"Homeric\\".Denise Levertov, Introduction, Mart√≠n & Meditations on the South Valley, New York, New Directions Publishing Corporation, p. xviii Reception In 1989, Mart√≠n & Meditations on the South Valley was awarded the 1988 Before Columbus Foundation's American Book Award.

Life Alfred Rives was the son of William Cabell and Judith (Walker) Rives. His father, who was among the most distinguished citizens of Virginia, was the United States minister to France, and he also filled the same position in 1848. Rives was taught by private tutors until fourteen years of age, then became a student of Concord Academy. At the age of sixteen he entered the Virginia Military Institute, and graduated in two years, ranking sixth in a class of twenty-four. Being proficient in engineering, he determined to adopt that as a profession, and in 1848 entered the University of Virginia, where he remained one session, then accompanied his father to France. After a year devoted to the study of mathematics and French, he successfully passed an examination for entrance in the Government Engineering School of France, \\"Ecole des ponts et Chaussees.\\" After graduation in 1854, he was offered a position upon the great French railroad, \\"Du Nord,\\" but instead returned to the United States, where he served in the engineering corps of the Virginia Midland railway. Later Rives accepted a position in Washington under Captain Montgomery C. Meigs of the United States Engineering Corps. He served for a year as assistant engineer of the United States Capitol and Post Office buildings. He was appointed Secretary of the Interior under President Pierce, to report upon the best location for a bridge across the Potomac. He presented details and estimates for the project in the 1857 \\"Congressional records\\". The report was favorably received, and Rives was selected to make calculations and estimates for this Cabin John bridge, which was built under his supervision. He returned to Virginia, his native state, upon its secession from the Union. Three days later he received the commission of captain of engineers from the state of Virginia, and was directed to report to Colonel Andrew Talcott, at that time chief engineer of the state. Rives was assigned to duty on the lower Virginia peninsula, and upon the resignation of Colonel Talcott was soon made acting chief engineer of the state of Virginia. Later, Rives was appointed acting chief of the Engineer Bureau of the Confederate States, a position he held until the close of the Civil War. He was promoted successively to be major, lieutenant-colonel and colonel of engineers. After the war he was offered a professorship in several institutions of learning, and also a good architectural position under the United States government, all of which he declined, preferring to try to recover his fortunes in Richmond as an engineer and architect. In 1868 was division engineer of the Chesapeake & Ohio railroad. In 1870 he was appointed chief engineer of the Mobile & Birmingham railroad. He was engineer in charge of the South & North Alabama railroad and part of the Louisville & Nashville system, which he completed in 1873. He was offered by Gen. William T. Sherman, for the Khedive of Egypt, the position of chief engineer of the civil works of Egypt, which position he declined to accept and of chief engineer and general superintendent of the Mobile & Ohio railroad. In 1883, Rives became vice-president and general manager of the Richmond and Danville Railroad, now a part of the Southern Railway System. In 1886, was appointed a member of the United States commissioned to inspect and receive on the part of the government forty miles of the Northern Pacific Railroad in the state of Washington, and the following year became general superintendent of the Panama Railroad, and while with that railroad went to Paris, and concluded a traffic agreement with the Canal Company. He presented to the canal commission a plan for the completion of the Panama Canal, in which he had always taken a great interest. In 1894, he communicated to the director of the canal a plan for the construction of a part at La Boca in the vicinity of Panama, which if constructed would tend greatly to facilitate and increase the traffic across the isthmus. After resigning his position with the Panama railroad, he was made chief engineer of the Cape Cod Canal. He was also elected vice president, and was specially charged with the construction of the Vera Cruz & Pacific railroad in Mexico. He died at Castle Hill, February 27, 1903.

He won the silver medal in the superpipe in 2013 Winter X Games XVII at the age of 14, becoming the youngest medalist in X Games history, and won silver medals in the halfpipe at both the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi and the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. Early life Ayumu Hirano was born and raised in a small coastal city called Murakami in Niigata Prefecture situated in a rather snowy area in Japan. His mother named him Ayumu (Ê≠©Â§¢), which literally means \\"walk the dream\\" (Ê≠©Ôºùwalk, Â§¢Ôºùdream), wishing him to become a person who would know the joy of pursuing a dream and the perseverance to make it come true. His father, Hidenori, was a surfer who eventually opened a surf shop, and later made a skate park (Nihonkai Skate Park) from scratch in his hometown of Murakami. The father originally hoped his son, Ayumu, to become a surfer, but the son did not like it much. Instead, he got absorbed in skateboarding, following the footstep of his 3-year-older brother, Eiju. He started skateboarding at the age of 4, and the snowboarding half a year later. He said he did not even remember how he started as he was too young and as it was just so natural for him. He belonged to the skateboarding team \\"e-Yume Kids\\" (meaning team \\"great dream kids\\") at Nihonkai Skate Park and joined skateboarding competitions. As there was not a halfpipe near their hometown, his father often had to drive Hirano all the way to Yokone ski resort in Yamagata Prefecture, where there was the first official permanent halfpipe in Japan, which, however, is 4 meters narrower than the world standard halfpipe. Burton, one of the leading snowboarding brands, has been sponsoring Hirano since he was a fourth-grader. Career Hirano's first big international snowboarding success was in March 2011, when he won the Burton US Junior Open. At the age of 12, the sixth-grader was not officially allowed to enter the open division of the event, where his mentor Kazuhiro Kokubo would win gold and his brother Eiju would take the 7th place. However, between rounds he dropped into the pipe as a \\"poacher\\" and amazed the audience with his ride with grand amplitude. In 2012, he was invited to the Burton High Fives, an open event held in New Zealand to win the gold at the age of 13. In 2013, he was invited to compete in the Winter X Games in Aspen, Colorado, snowboarding's biggest non-Olympic stage, where he won silver in the halfpipe behind Shaun White, who explained: \\"The Japanese rider who got second is 14 years old. It's amazing!\\" He continued on with a first place at the Burton European Open, a second place at the Burton US Open (also behind Shaun White), and a third place at the Oakley Arctic Challenge, becoming the 2012/2013 Halfpipe World Tour Champion. With this, he became the youngest rider to achieve this title. In the 2014 Winter Olympics at Sochi, he won the silver, behind Switzerland's Iouri Podladtchikov. Hirano again took the silver in the half pipe at the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang; with Shaun White of the U.S. taking the gold and Scotty James of Australia garnering the bronze.https://mobile.twitter.com/abcgrandstand Style Hirano takes a goofy stance with his right foot forward, and his precise technique, timing and fearlessness allow him a greater verticality in taking off from the lips of the pipe, granting him an extraordinary amplitude in his air while making his tricks look effortless and time-stopping. Influences Hirano's mentor other than his parents is Kazuhiro Kokubo, a Japanese two-time US open winner in the halfpipe. Hirano said in an interview in 2013 by a Japanese magazine, Transworld Snowboarding Japan, \\"The environment has dramatically changed after I first went to the US. I met Kazu (Kokubo) and Carl (Harris), and it made it possible for me to join Mt. Hood summer camp, and to compete in New Zealand. It gave me the experience in different pipes and I got to see the leading riders ride. I came to understand what world class means and knew what I needed to improve.\\" Kokubo has been mentoring Hirano since 2011, and was assigned as the official technical coach for the Japanese national snowboarder team in 2013 by the Ski Association of Japan to support them in 2012‚Äì2013 season. Among Hirano's other coaches are Ben Boyd and Elijah Teter at Ski & Snowboard Club Vail. Hirano's father has had the motto of \\"Personality comes first. The most essential is the most important\\" throughout his parenting and running his kids' skateboarding team.

Slater contributed significantly to the field of technical analysis as a way to uncover price movements and trends. Slater is also referred to frequently by the nickname \\"TC\\" by close family friends and his grandchildren. Career=Early Employment= After graduating from Cornell University in 1956, and completing his ROTC commitment, Slater settled in Atlanta, Georgia he was hired by a division of Textron to sell polyethylene products in five southeastern states. Slater moved to New Orleans in late 1957 and joined Uarco, Inc., a company that manufactured carbon-free business forms for invoices, shipping documentation, and other record keeping forms where duplication was necessary. His sales region included the Southern states. Slater in 1959 and started Gulf Poly Plastics, which fabricated all types of customized fabrication of industrial Plexiglas, Teflon, polyester and fiberglass to the Louisiana \\"oil patch\\" and shipping industries. The distribution company was located in a warehouse on Tchoupitoulas Street. Given Slater‚Äôs experience and knowledge with plastics, he started a new company called \\"Sea Foam\\" in 1962. Sea Foam was sprayed as a precise mixture of synthetic resin and hardener which expanded into foam in the hollow structure of oil drilling rigs to keep the structure afloat should the sub-surface rig become punctured or cracked. Because of the inherent operating risks of working in ship yards and off-shore, Slater discontinued his work with sea foam in 1969 and became a business broker specializing in helping companies find buyers and sellers for many small and medium-sized family businesses that provided goods and services in the growing petroleum industry. Slater is a lifelong student of the financial markets and became fascinated with the commodity markets and the use of graphical technical analysis tools to analyze them. He drew a large number of financial charts by hand and subscribed to a number of charting services for those markets he could not follow on a day-to- day basis. Updating the charts was a laborious task and trying to calculate technical studies and apply these to the charts was even more difficult. Therefore, Slater used acetate slides to overlay studies onto the charts to identify trend movements. In 1979, with the acquisition of a Texas Instruments TI-59 programmable calculator which was capable of holding 5000 program steps and a magnetic card reader for data storage, Slater was able to program the device to calculate basic technical analysis computations.Gopalakrishnan, J, \\"Then and Now With Tim Slater\\", Traders, 24 January 2011 The problem of drawing the charts by hand which was time consuming and prone to error, remained. =Kaf Trac Newsletter= Slater knew the limitation of the small calculator would not keep up with the growing number of technical analysis studies that were being shared and developed, such as the Relative Strength Index, Stochastic oscillator, Exponential Moving Average, and other momentum- based technical analysis indicators. In 1972, Slater began to use the shared computer facilities at Tulane University, and working with a number of computer science graduate students, began to produce tables of daily, weekly and monthly, closing market prices along with their corresponding technical analysis study. Subsequently, Slater began publishing a weekly newsletter on Fridays called, ‚ÄúKaf-Trac‚Äù which focused on gold mining stock and the spot and futures market. The weekly letter consisted mainly of closing prices and technical analysis data presented in a tabular format. The circulation never exceeded 200. =CompuTrac= The CompuTrac program began its early development in 1977 when Slater realized that the Apple II computer, could read large amounts of data, calculate the technical indicators and display graphics on its 10-inch monochrome green screen. However, with no programming experience, Slater was led to the computer science department at Loyola University of New Orleans and met Professor James Schmit. With Tim‚Äôs understanding of the commodity markets and Jim‚Äôs knowledge of the BASIC programming language for the personal Computer, they planned, programmed, and completed the first commercial CompuTrac version 1.0 in July 1977.Hutson, Jack K, \\"February 2006 Letters To The Editor\\", Traders Magazine, February 2006 The first office was set up in Slater‚Äôs home in the Garden District, New Orleans. Schmit transitioned from university teaching and began to manage a small part- time team of programmers drawn mostly from among his students. Slater handled marketing, sales, and contributed to product strategy by consulting with a growing pool of other traders and technical analysts who took a keen interest in the CompuTrac software by contributing to its library of technical analysis studies and tools. To help finance the very early development of Compu Trac, Slater approached three fellow market technicians who were following his early progress in commercializing the first version. Walter Bressert, Jim Sibbett, Richard L. Redmont along with Tim Slater, its founder, were the original \\"members\\" of the TAG group. The company was incorporated as the \\"Technical Analysis Group\\" or TAG for short. Shares were issued to Slater, Schmit and the group's early investors. Many of the technical indicators and studies used today were first implemented and popularized in CompuTrac. The Stochastic oscillator study, for example was programmed from the work of George Lane and Ralph Dystant. The indicator's lines were named \\"%K\\" and %D\\" but Slater needed a single name which was more accessible and the word \\"stochastic\\" was written on the paper, so he gave the study that name, and it has persisted.Burke, Gibbons, \\"Taking a new look at the Stochastic family\\", Futures Magazine, March 1992 Another example is the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) study by Gerald Appel.Aspray, Tom, \\"Demystifying the MACD\\", Forbes Magazine, October 2011 =TAG Seminars= Slater realized that the collective knowledge of technicians across the United States was important for the future development of CompuTrac and it proved to be a successful marketing tool to establish the company as innovators in the industry by educating traders on the technical analysis tools that exist to understand market trends. The seminars also had a ‚Äúcult‚Äù following because it gathered together the pioneers of the industry and allowed technical analysts to network and share trading ideas. CompuTrac conducted 22 seminars in the United States. The events were called TAG for ‚ÄúTechnical Analysis Group‚Äù (TAG) Seminars. The first TAG conference was held in New Orleans in 1979 and the final TAG XXII was held in Las Vegas in 1999. At each event CompuTrac recorded, on cassette tape, all the speaker presentations. Over the years CompuTrac built an archive of over 400 recordings from all twenty two events. Subsequently, CompuTrac members could acquire the tapes and documentation and allow self-study. The TAG events were instrumental in helping to educate individual and institutional traders to the advances of technical analysis and continue to increase sales of the CompuTrac software.Hewison, Adam, \\"INO TV\\", ino.com, February 2013 Technical Analysis Group Seminar (TAG) I ‚Äì New Orleans, Louisiana 1980 Technical Analysis Group Seminar (TAG)I I ‚Äì New Orleans, Louisiana 1981 Technical Analysis Group Seminar (TAG)III ‚Äì Toronto, Canada 1982 Technical Analysis Group Seminar (TAG) IV ‚Äì San Francisco, California 1983 Technical Analysis Group Seminar (TAG) V ‚Äì New Orleans, Louisiana 1984 Technical Analysis Group Seminar (TAG) VI ‚Äì New Orleans, Louisiana 1985 Technical Analysis Group Seminar (TAG) VII ‚ÄìBoston, Massachusetts 1985 Technical Analysis Group Seminar (TAG) VIII ‚Äì New Orleans, Louisiana 1986 Technical Analysis Group Seminar (TAG) IX ‚Äì San Francisco, California 1987 Technical Analysis Group Seminar (TAG) X ‚Äì Washington D.C. 1988 Technical Analysis Group Seminar (TAG) XI ‚Äì New Orleans, Louisiana 1989 Technical Analysis Group Seminar (TAG) XII ‚Äì Los Angeles, California 1990 Technical Analysis Group Seminar (TAG) XIII ‚Äì Washington D.C. 1991 Technical Analysis Group Seminar (TAG) XIV ‚Äì New Orleans, Louisiana 1992 Technical Analysis Group Seminar (TAG) XV ‚Äì Las Vegas, Nevada 1993 Technical Analysis Group Seminar (TAG) XVI ‚Äì Las Vegas, Nevada 1994 Technical Analysis Group Seminar (TAG) XVII ‚Äì Las Vegas, Nevada 1995 Technical Analysis Group Seminar (TAG) XVIII ‚Äì New Orleans, Louisiana 1996 Technical Analysis Group Seminar (TAG) XIX ‚Äì Las Vegas, Nevada 1997 Technical Analysis Group Seminar (TAG) XX ‚Äì Las Vegas, Nevada 1998 =Telerate acquires CompuTrac= In June 1986 CompuTrac launched the \\"Teletrac\\" charting and analysis system which operated using real-time data and used a proprietary hardware platform designed by Schmit and his engineering group. Leverage Telerate's large domestic and international institutional subscriber base, the product covered, charting for commodities, indices, the spot foreign exchange and fixed income markets. Teletrac offered 32 technical analysis indicators, intra-day charting time frames of 5 minute, hourly, daily, weekly and monthly and the ability to perform algorithmic system testing.Jobman, Darrell, \\"Technical analysis software: What's new for traders\\", Futures, December 1986 In order to grow the company further and maximize the success of Teletrac, Slater knew that real- time data would be required to market the software to financial institutions. After declining to sell CompuTrac to Reuters, Slater approached Telerate, a real-time financial information company that was affiliated with Cantor- Fitzgerald, a primary U.S. Treasuries brokerage firm. CompuTrac was acquired by Telerate in October 1985 and re-branded as \\"TeleTrac\\". In 1987, Kyodo News Service, which was the Japanese distributor for Telerate's market data services, formed the \\"Value-Added Sales Team\\", headed by Peter Jaeger, and began marketing TeleTrac in Tokyo. =Dow Jones Seminars= Dow Jones & Company purchased the remaining shares of Telerate on September 22, 1989From Reuters, \\"Dow Jones Makes an Offer for Remainder of Telerate\\", Los Angeles Times, September 1989 and CompuTrac was transferred to its new owners. The business continued to grow very well for the Teletrac product, however, sales of CompuTrac began to slow. Dow Jones decided to end the support and development of Compu Trac on April 25, 1994.Dow Jones Telerate Memo, \\"Memo Henry Becker Executive Vice President Dow Jones Telerate\\", External Communication, April 25, 1994 Slater was asked to remain with Dow Jones Telerate and continue his leadership with the TAG events which was growing into larger, multi-stream conferences in the United States, Europe and Asia. With the cooperation of Dow Jones, Slater set up a separate division called, Dow Jones Seminars and assumed the role of President of the division. In 1999 Slater organized his last seminar for Dow Jones and retired. Personal life Tim Slater was born to Louis Charles Slater (December 26, 1898 ‚Äì November 10, 1958) and D. Slater (November 26, 1910 ‚Äì November 10, 1958). In 1937, Louis Slater accepted a job as Sales Manager for the Southern Region with the Fulton Bag and Cotton Mills and moved the family to New Orleans, Louisiana from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The family first moved to a house at 2607 Coliseum Street in the Garden District. In 1942 Louis and Dorothy moved to 1745 Arabella Street and then built a new home in the Garden District in 1957 where Slater currently resides with his wife. Slater attended Choate Rosemary Hall preparatory school in from 1946 to 1950, however, he graduated from Isidore Newman School, in New Orleans in 1952. He attended Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. As a freshman, he planned to earn a degree in mechanical engineering, however he switched to Economics in his second year. He was a member of the Seal and Serpent fraternity and enlisted in the universities ROTC program. After graduation in 1956, he completed his ROTC commitments with the United States Army reserve in Fort Lee, New Jersey and was discharged in 1963 from the U.S. Army Reserves with the rank of Second Lieutenant.

She has played for SKV Ravensburg and Sabres Ulm in the German wheelchair basketball league. In December 2012 she was contracted to play for first division club RSV Lahn-Dill as well as Sabres Ulm. She has also played the national team, with which she won two European titles, was runner-up at 2010 World Championships, and won a gold medal at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London. After the London Games, President Joachim Gauck awarded the team Germany's highest sporting honour, the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt (Silver Laurel Leaf). Biography Annabel Breuer was born on 23 October 1992. She lives with her three siblings, her parents and her dog in Birkenhardt, a small town in Swabia roughly halfway between Lake Constance and Ulm. She became a paraplegic as a result of an automotive accident when she was a child. Breuer started playing wheelchair fencing recreationally. She won silver at the 2006 Wheelchair Fencing World Cup in Turin at the age of 13. but was unable to participate in the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing due to surgery on her spinal cord. At the 2009 European Championships in Warsaw she won gold with the German epee team, and silver and bronze in the singles. As a result, the German Sports Foundation named 16-year-old Breuer as its Junior Sportsman of the Year for 2009 in Disability Sport. She competed in the 2010 World Championships in Paris, but was placed fifth and did not medal. She was awarded the Hilde Frey Prize in 2011, and said that her goal was to be at the 2012 Summer Paralympic Games in London. Breuer attended the Paralympics in London, but as a wheelchair basketball player rather than as a fencer. She was introduced to the sport by a friend, and spotted by a national trainer. Breuer played for Sabines Ulm, where she was the only woman on a mixed gender side. She is classified as a 1.5 point player, but women get a 1.5 point bonus when playing on a mixed team, making her in effect a zero-point player. Her classification, along with her high technical acumen, means that she is a valuable asset on any team. Breuer was part of the German national team which won gold at the 2011 European Championships in Nazareth, Israel, defeating the Netherlands in the final, 48‚Äì42. In June 2012 she was named as one of the team that competed at the 2012 Summer Paralympic Games in London. In the Gold Medal match, the team faced the Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team, a team that had defeated them 48‚Äì46 in Sydney just a few months before. They defeated the Australians 44‚Äì58 in front of a crowd of over 12,000 at the North Greenwich Arena to win the gold medal, They were awarded another Silver Laurel Leaf by President Joachim Gauck in November 2012, and were again named Team of the Year for 2012. In a ceremony in Ulm, Breuer was congratulated by the Lord Mayor, Ivo G√∂nner, and her name was entered in the Golden Book of the city. In December 2012, it was announced that in addition to playing for second division Sabres Ulm, she would also play for five-time Champions League winning first division club RSV Lahn-Dill in 2013. , due to the constant interruptions to her education due to training and competitions, Breuer, who speaks English, French, German and Spanish, had yet to complete her final high school examinations at Matthias Erzberger school in Biberach. The German team claimed silver at the 2014 Women's World Wheelchair Basketball Championship in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and beat the Netherlands in the 2015 European Championships, to claim its tenth European title. At the 2016 Paralympic Games, it won silver after losing the final to the United States.

Officially known as ‚ÄúS‚Äù Camp, it was predominantly for Italians and was in existence from July 1940 until November 1944.  Location  Douglas on the Isle of Man, the site of Metropole Camp Metropole camp was located towards the northern end of the Douglas promenade, just before Strathallan Crescent and Summer Hill.c.1910 Street Map from Black's Guide The back of the camp was only a few yards from the rockface below Little Switzerland.  Capacity  The camp opened in the first week of July 1940 with 743 internees. This number rose over the subsequent months but then dropped to 650 by January 1941. By October 1944 it had only 482 internees, and it was closed in the first week of November 1944.Island of Barbed Wire, Connery Chappell, Corgi Books, 1984  Structure  The camp comprised four former hotels and boarding houses: the Alexander (later renamed the Continental) and Metropole Hotels, the Waverley and Dodsworth‚Äôs. The Metropole Hotel had on its ground floor a canteen, a general store, a billiard room, a hall, a library, and a dining room, (which also acted as a recreation room outside of mealtimes). In the basement was a bakery, the parcel post office and the kitchen. On the ground floor of the Alexander Hotel was the camp office, the assembly room, and a large dining room. In the basement were kitchens (where internees were permitted to do private cooking), a music room with a piano, correction room (for use by the internees‚Äô ‚ÄúHouse Council‚Äù when they did not wish to report lighter misdeeds to the military authorities), and a room used as the church (where Mass was offered and confessions heard by internee priests). In the Waverley on the ground floor was a large recreation room and dining room. In the basement of was the barber‚Äôs shop, carpenter‚Äôs shop, welfare office and a room used as a school. The first, second and third floors of all the houses were devoted to bedrooms, bathrooms and toilets. The Alexandra had four bathrooms on each floor, the Metropole three and the Waverley two on each floor. Most rooms were occupied by three men, although some were occupied by only one man, and some were set up as family rooms where up to eight men and boys could stay together. Dodsworths was the infirmary. Outside of the fence were the military headquarters, and a prison for internees undergoing special punishment. The latter of these was previously a stable used for the horses used for horse-drawn trams. > ‚ÄúIt was an interesting prison, three feet wide and six long, with a manger > at one end on which you could neither sit nor lie, a small ventilator window > and a cobbled floor which was always damp.

Meals were generally taken communally, an unusual occurrence in the Manx internment camps possible only because of the large dining rooms stretching the length of the ground floor of the hotels.Island of Barbed Wire, Connery Chappell, Corgi Books, 1984, p.83 The men were free to entertain themselves between meals, which they did through various recreational, sporting and educational activities. A school existed in the Metropole Hotel where French, English, Latin, German and Russian classes were taught. Cabaret performances were produced by internees in the dining room of Metropole Hotel, which was also used for indoor sports outside of mealtimes. In the basement of the Waverley was an Italian elementary school which was for the benefit of a number of sailors who could not read or write. Excursions under guard were also permitted, most notably walks along and beyond the promenade, and also swimming in the sea. After an initial period at the beginning of the war, internees were permitted to apply to work outside of the camp on local farms. They also took up business of their own within the camp, for which they started their own internal currency created from stamped pieces of cardboard.Manx Money Goes Under the Hammer , The Manx Independent, Saturday 16 February 2013 Visits from relatives were permitted with prior arrangement and official permits from the Home Office. These would be for a limited period of time within a designated area of the camp. At 5pm roll call was again taken and the names announced of those being released in the morning were announced, a practice that began in October 1941 with the beginning of the release of ‚Äúgrade C‚Äù and soon ‚Äúgrade B‚Äù internees considered to be a little or no harm to the Allies. Troop discipline was considered to be slack in comparison to the other camps on the island. Thefts from military stores and the occasional guard asleep on duty were reported, as were poor or forgotten searches of internees returning to the camp. During the infrequent air raids on the island, the camp was evacuated to a quarry a hundred yards behind the camp.Paper Hero, L.N. Giovannelli, Island Development Co 1971, quoted on Metropole Mansions, Manxnotebook  Escape attempts  There were three attempted escapes from Metropole camp. One concerned a man whose English wife was on the island to visit him. She was staying in a private hotel yards from the camp and so the internee escaped to visit her in her bedroom. However, he ‚Äúonly got as far as his shirt‚Äù,‚ÄúAn Italian who Stayed‚Äù on the BBC WWII People‚Äôs War website as the police arrived within minutes, having been informed by other guests at the hotel. On 21 September 1942, two men broke through the wire to escape, but when they heard a guard approaching they hid in the Crescent Hotel next door to the camp. Within three hours they had been caught and returned to the camp, having spent most of that time hiding in a bedroom of the hotel. A Marine engineer who spoke no English had suffered from psychiatric problems in the camp and so had briefly been a resident at the psychiatric hospital before being returned to the camp. However, he escaped from the camp, in order to walk back to the hospital to readmit himself.Island of Barbed Wire, Connery Chappell, Corgi Books, 1984, p.207  References  See also  * : People interned in the Isle of Man during World War II Internment camps in the Isle of Man Buildings and structures in the Isle of Man Unfree labor during World War II ","title":"Metropole Internment Camp"},{"id":"38548509","text":"Loriann Hoff Oberlin (born June 2, 1961) is an American writer and author as well as a licensed clinical professional counselor. She has co-written Overcoming Passive-Aggression: How To Stop Hidden Anger From Spoiling Your Relationships, Career and Happiness as well as The Angry Child: Regaining Control When Your Child Is Out of Control. She is also the author of Surviving Separation and Divorce, in addition to several other non-fiction books. In addition, she writes fiction using the pen name Lauren Monroe. Her first novel, published in 2014, was titled Letting Go: Book One of The Maryland Shores. She wrote a second novel in the series titled \\"Second Chances: Book Two of The Maryland Shores\\" that was released in 2015.  Early writing career  Oberlin was born in a suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and identified her passion for books and writing during her high school years.[1] She is a graduate of Montour High School and went on to earn a B.A. from Westminster College, in New Wilmington, Pennsylvania in 1983. During her collegiate years, she worked on the college newspaper, at the campus radio and television station as a broadcast major, and interned at KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh. Oberlin's early career focused upon public relations, freelance writing and teaching writing in various lifelong learning programs at community colleges in Western Pennsylvania. She contributed regularly to regional parenting publications across the country and to national magazines including Elegant Bride, Bridal Guide, The Saturday Evening Post, First for Women, Parenting, Parents, Woman's World, US Air Magazine, and Hemispheres. She wrote a column for the Pittsburgh Business Times on work/life balance and contributed to the Pittsburgh Post- Gazette. Oberlin also taught non-fiction book and magazine article writing classes at college continuing education programs and through Writer's Digest Online Workshops.[2] Her first book Writing For Money was published by Writer's Digest Books (F&W; Media) in 1995, followed by Working At Home While The Kids Are There, Too (Career Press) in 1997. She was an initial contributor to the Insider's Guide to Pittsburgh (2000, first edition) the same year that Surviving Separation and Divorce: A Woman's Guide to Making It Through the First Year was published. During her writing career, she also contributed to the Everything series published by Adams Media and later revised the second edition of the Compass American Guide to Pennsylvania.[3]  Collaborative Work  While working as contributors to a regional parenting publication Tim Murphy, Ph.D., a practicing psychologist in Pittsburgh, sought help for his first book. The two collaborated producing The Angry Child: Regaining Control When Your Child Is Out of Control (Random House), published in 2001. The Angry Child won the National Parenting Publications Award. Murphy went on to serve in the Pennsylvania State Senate and was elected in 2002 to the U.S. House of Representatives where he represented the 18th Congressional District from 2003 until 2017.[4] Following a move to Maryland in 2001, Oberlin continued her writing and teaching at Montgomery College and at the University of Pittsburgh's Informal Program.[5] She also taught online through Writer's Digest Workshops and Barnes & Noble. In 2004, she published Writing For Quick Cash: Turn Your Way With Words Into Real Money. In 2005, she revised Surviving Separation and Divorce (F&W;/Adams Media), a book that was seen in the motion picture and DVD The Other Woman, starring Natalie Portman. This book was also published in Spanish. Also in 2005, Oberlin and Murphy published their second collaboration choosing to write about passive-aggression, which is little understood. In what Publisher's Weekly called a work that provides ample opportunity and exercises for personal growth, Overcoming Passive-Aggression: How To Stop Hidden Anger From Spoiling Your Relationships, Career and Happiness became the only consumer book discussing passive aggression as a type of concealed, indirect anger in both genders and of all ages. The book was initially acquired and published by Marlowe, which became subsumed by Perseus/DaCapo and Perseus Academic Publishing.[6] In 2016, Ms. Oberlin drafted the book's revision, adding new chapters, updating anecdotes, creating educational graphics, and citing new interviews, research, and sources. Dr. Murphy contributed some material, as his time permitted. This 2016 edition contains information to assist professionals and healthcare providers when they must deal with non-compliant clients or patients. It also encourages self-care among those in helping professions. The revised edition launched in time for the 2016 holiday season where it helped readers deal with difficult people during the holiday season. Hachette, now the parent company for DaCapo Lifelong Books, issued the audio book as well.  Counseling and mental health career  During the writing of Overcoming Passive Aggression (2005), Oberlin was enrolled in a graduate program at Johns Hopkins University, and in 2006, earned her MS in Counseling, followed by a post-master's certificate in clinical counseling later that same year. After meeting the clinical requirements for state licensure, she began work as an LGPC and later as a fully licensed LCPC. In 2008, she began Loriann Oberlin Counseling & Mediation, LLC in North Potomac, Maryland and added another office in Easton, Maryland, in 2012.[7] Oberlin's counseling career focuses upon helping individuals (elementary age children through seniors), couples, and families. She has also offered group counseling and mediation services after obtaining the 40-hour state divorce mediation training and 20-hour child access training. Her Easton, Maryland office is now her primary practice location though she sees clients in North Potomac weekly as well. Oberlin helps children and teens, men and women through life's stressful moments such as school, bullying, attentional and learning challenges, relationship and health problems, parenting, job stress, death or other anxiety-ridden times. The Star Democrat reported in January 2013 that Oberlin will add a women's support group to her Easton office because \\"women tend to put their selfcare last,\\" she said. In 2014 through 2016, Loriann Oberlin completed two levels of Gottman Method Couples Counseling training to enhance her work with troubled relationships and families. Oberlin had contributed to Blogs on Divorce through Divorce Magazine for several years.[8] She is an occasional contributor to parenting and other publications on a freelance basis as her time permits. Loriann Oberlin resides on Maryland's eastern shore with her husband Robert and her two sons, enjoying Chesapeake living, boating, reading, and travel while also writing and working in the mental health field. She speaks in community settings such as at the Talbot County Public Library and other venues.[9] Fiction writing & Volunteer Work In 2014, Oberlin added novelist to her writing credentials, writing under the pen name Lauren Monroe with the women's fiction/contemporary romance Letting Go: The Maryland Shores, Book One in the series she started.[10] She chose the pen name Lauren Monroe for symbolic reasons, as she always liked the first name and used to live and work outside of Pittsburgh in a town called Monroeville. In 2015, \\"Second Chances: The Maryland Shores,\\" Book Two was released. The series weaves in facets of her former hometown, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania while the rest of the setting takes place in the DC/MD region during a particularly tense time in that region's history. The novels are available as Ebooks and are published in paperback, available online and at several stores on the Maryland Eastern Shore. In 2016, the novels were released in large print editions to help those older readers and the visually impaired. The website for her fiction work is www.laurenmonroenovels.com. Lauren Monroe maintains a social media presence on Facebook, Pinterest, and Goodreads with an author page. A Facebook group for The Maryland Shores women's fiction fans exists as well. Oberlin is a member of the Eastern Shore Writers Association. She has served on the planning committee for the Bay to Ocean Writer's Conference held at Chesapeake College, and presented at the Bay to Ocean Writers Conference in 2015 and 2017. She will also speak at the 2018 conference for this group and has also participated in individual and group book signings. These include the Baltimore Book Festival in 2014, Kent Island Library Holiday Book Signing in December 2014, and the Gaithersburg Book Festival in 2015 and 2017.

History Its roots lay in the preaching of an itinerant canon regular, Bartolomeo of Rome, who was a proponent of the new spirituality of the Devotio Moderna which had developed in the Low Countries and was starting to spread in northern Italy. While ministering in Venice in 1396 he met two young noblemen, Gabriele Condulmer (the future Pope Eugene IV) and his cousin, Antonio Correr, the nephew of Cardinal Angelo Correr, soon elected as Pope Gregory XII. Under his inspiration, the cousins decided to give up their wealth and to lead lives of prayer and service. In 1400 they began to live together as a small religious community, modeled on the Brothers of the Common Life, following the Rule of St. Augustine. They lived in a house lent to them by a relative. One of the first men to join them there was Lawrence Giustiniani, who was a deacon at the time, the first cleric of the small community. In 1404 they were given the use of a monastery of Augustinian friars on the isolated island of St. George in Alga, which was almost empty, by its commendatory prior, a young nobleman, Ludovico Barbo, who soon himself joined the community. The new monastery quickly grew to have 17 members, all members of the clergy by then, and received the approval of Pope Boniface IX on 30 November of that year. Though essentially contemplative in their way of life, some of the canons did undertake a limited active Christian ministry. The provost of the community was elected annually up to that point. Nevertheless, they successfully combined aspects of prayer, a simple lifestyle and solitude with the solemn celebration of the liturgy. They enjoyed a reputation for both simplicity and dedication and appear to have achieved the canonical idea of fidelity to the life of an enclosed religious order without religious vows, which were not introduced until 1568. Before this time, they were therefore a congregation of secular canons. The canons wore a white habit with a blue cloak. The success of the community led to the adoption of their way of life by a large number of communities of canons in the region, leading to the formation of a new congregation of canons. Giustiniani spent many years at the Priory of St. Augustine in Vicenza, and assisted in numerous other foundations until he was named a bishop. In 1408 Pope Gregory appointed Barbo to be the abbot of the Benedictine Abbey of Santa Giustina in Padua, which he reformed with help of two monks, two Camaldolese novices and three canons of San Giorgio in Alga. At that point Barbo became a Benedictine monk. Through his leadership, the life of the abbey was dramatically revived and eventually became the center of the Congregation of Santa Giustina, which became an important center of reform of Benedictine monasteries in Italy. In 1424 the canons elected their first Superior General to oversee the houses of their burgeoning congregation. Pope Gregory XII called his nephew Antonio Correr and Gabriele Condulmer to Rome to serve as cardinals. Condulmer later became Pope Eugene IV and Giustiniani became the first Patriarch of Venice, promoting the reform of the city and the spread of the Gospel throughout his episcopate. Like the Theatines in the 16th century, this congregation enjoyed much more influence and importance than its size would suggest. For these canons, the 15th century was their high point, however. By the 17th century, the congregation had entered a period of decay. Vocations and the level of dedication to the life declined. Finally, in 1688, the monastery of San Giorgio was suppressed and its property was confiscated and sold off to raise money for the defense of the Republic of Venice against the Ottoman Empire.

Sea slugs in this genus are highly simplified and uniform. Distribution The genus Pontohedyle shows a circumtropical distribution with a single derived species (Mediterranean/ Black Sea Pontohedyle milaschewitchii) inhabiting temperate waters. In the absence of a fossil record for meiofaunal slugs, the only available estimate for divergence times derives from a molecular clock approach, calibrated with shelled heterobranch fossils. J√∂rger et al. (2010)J√∂rger K. M., St√∂ger I., Kano Y., Fukuda H., Knebelsberger T. & Schr√∂dl M. (2010). \\"On the origin of Acochlidia and other enigmatic euthyneuran gastropods, with implications for the systematics of Heterobranchia\\". BMC Evolutionary Biology 10: 323. . estimated the origin of the genus Pontohedyle to the late Cretaceous, 84 mya (95% confidence interval ranging from 160‚Äì60 mya), providing a rough estimation of how much time was available for diversification and circum- global dispersal of Pontohedyle slugs. Pontohedyle has never been found in colder waters despite a well-studied meiofauna and hydrographic conditions similar to the Mediterranean. The distribution of Pontohedyle might be constrained by ancestry from warm-water adapted animals. Considering the estimated mid to late Mesozoic origin and the recent primarily tropical distribution pattern in Pontohedyle, it is most likely that this meiofaunal slug clade originated in Tethyan waters. Map of Pontohedyle distribution.  Description  With its vermiform body, a putatively multi-functional radula, ‚Äòsimplified‚Äô organ systems and a special fast and imprecise mode of sperm transfer, Pontohedyle reflects a meiofaunal slug lineage highly adapted to its interstitial habitat. Pontohedyle is morphologically well-defined genus of meiofaunal slugs. Specimens of Pontohedyle are externally uniform and easily distinguishable from other acochlids by the lack of rhinophores and the bow- shaped oral tentacles. Pontohedyle typically bear monaxone, rodlet-like spicules distributed randomly and frequently accumulated between the oral tentacles. No diagnostic differences in external morphology or spicules could be detected between the collected populations apart from eyes externally visible or not. Comparative SEM-examination of the available radulae revealed two types of the typically hook-shaped radula: a lateral tooth without a denticle (Pontohedyle verrucosa) or with a denticle (Pontohedyle milaschewitchii). Pontohedyle slugs have a well-adapted body plan that can be conserved for millions of years in a worldwide evolutionary success story. Pontohedyle presents a stunning example of extreme morphological stasis and uniformity over long evolutionary timeframes, probably constrained by their simplified bodyplan and by the requirements of the meiofaunal habitat. Species The first discovered Pontohedyle species is well described and abundant Pontohedyle milaschewitchii from the Black Sea and Mediterranean. The second discovered species is poorly known Western Pacific Pontohedyle verrucosa from the Solomon Islands. In absence of distinguishing morphological characters J√∂rger et al. (2007)J√∂rger K.

Civita (9 August 1936 ‚Äì 26 May 2013) was a Brazilian businessman and publisher. Born in Italy, he emigrated at the age of two with his family to New York in 1938 to escape effects of the Race Laws. They moved again to Brazil in 1949, where his father Victor Civita founded Editora Abril, a publishing house. After college and graduate school in the United States, the younger Civita entered the family business in the 1960s. He helped its expansion and development as Grupo Abril, becoming one of the largest publishing companies in Brazil. Beginning in 1982 he became president, and took over all operations in 1990. He became chairman of the Board of Directors and Editorial Head of Grupo Abril. He has also headed related education foundations and participated in leadership of the Lauder Institute and the Wharton Advisory Board. He was part of the Board of Overseers of the International Center for Economic Growth (founded in 1985 with headquarters in Panama).  Early life and education  Roberto Civita was born on 9 August 1936 in Milan, Italy to Sylvana and Victor Civita, who worked in publishing. He had a younger brother Richard. His family moved to New York City in 1938 after passage of the Race Laws in Italy. In 1949, the family moved to S√£o Paulo, Brazil, where his father, Victor Civita, had founded the Editora Abril, first publishing comic books under license from the Walt Disney Company. (Donald Duck was the first title, released in 1950). Civita did his college studies in the United States, beginning with nuclear physics at Rice University, Texas, but gave up the subject when he realized that it was not his calling. He graduated in journalism from the University of Pennsylvania and got a graduate degree in economics from its Wharton School of Economics. He also has a degree in sociology from Columbia University, New York City. During this time, he also worked as a trainee at Time Inc..  Marriage and family  He married Leila Francini of Sao Paulo. The couple had two sons (Giancarlo and Victor Civita Neto) and a daughter together. In more recent years, he married Maria Ant√¥nia Neto  Career  Civita returned to Brazil in the mid-1960s, to assume various positions at Editora Abril and organize a radical change in Brazilian journalism. He worked to establish a strong reputation for fact checking and an independent press. In addition, with his participation, Abril launched several major magazine titles for specific markets, such as Quatro Rodas (automotive), Claudia and Manequim (for women), Exame (business), Realidade, and Superinteressante (Science & Culture). From the founding in 1968 of the weekly Veja, the flagship of the company, Civita served as its Editor-in-Chief. Realidade was described as a model for editorial independence. The Company began to sell magazines through subscription sales rather than depend on newsstands. Like other publishers, Civita struggled to maintain press freedom under the long years of the repressive military government that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985. Some compromises were forced, as the government censored press it did not like. Mino Carta, co-founder and former managing editor of Veja (between 1968 and 1976), said that the military government's censorship imposed on the magazine was \\"very harsh.\\" It started in 1969 and did not end until 1976, when he resigned (or was fired, according to other sources). According to Carta, for being deemed an \\"enemy of the government\\", the military asked Roberto Civita to fire him. In exchange, the state bank Caixa Econ√¥mica Federal granted the company a loan of US$ 50 million. In 1982 Civita became president of the Grupo Abril, which had become one of the largest publishers in Brazil. He took command of all operations in 1990, after the death of his father Victor. By his own death, Civita had become a billionaire several times over.  Controversies  Decades later, Civita and Carta appeared to defend their actions related to Veja in the 1970s. In 2007 Civita said that Veja had no need to \\"please everyone\\", even if criticized for purportedly editorializing in its articles about politics. He also said that he had not made decisions to satisfy advertisers or the government. In 2007 he said, \\"We're doing the magazines for readers, not to please advertisers, nor government, nor friends.\\" During that 2007 interview, Civita also said he did not oppose his reporters using material discovered in wiretaps, even if they were not legally authorized. He said his newsroom's legal department advised on what could be published from such sources. He was willing to have internal debate about the use of such recordings, but never really did it. Five years later, an investigation made by the Brazilian Federal Police that used legally authorized wiretaps found that Policarpo Jr., the bureau chief of Veja in Brasilia, who talked very often with the mafiosi Carlinhos Cachoeira, had ordered illegal wiretapping of politicians linked to the government party to gain material for his reporters. Following this revelation, a May 2012 article in Mino Carta's CartaCapital compared Civita to the controversial British publisher, Rupert Murdoch, because of his effective control of so much of the Brazilian media and the use of methods that were less than ethical. This was published during the proceedings of the CPMI do Cachoeira, a widely reported parliamentary investigation of the Goiano Capo Carlinhos Cachoeira. It found that Cachoeira had unorthodox connections with politicians who were (as the ex-senator Dem√≥stenes Torres) and are (as the Rio's councilman Stepan Nercessian) opposed to the Workers Party. In response, the Rio de Janeiro newspaper O Globo, (owned by the Marinho family's media conglomerate, the largest in Brazil) editorialized: \\"Roberto Civita is not Rupert Murdoch.\\" The editorial said that \\"blogs and pro-government media outlets that act as the auxiliary line of radical sectors of the PT\\" had unleashed \\"an organized campaign against the Veja magazine.\\" = Naspers = Searching for capitalization, in May 2006 Civita sold 30% of the Editora Abril to the South Africa's media conglomerate Naspers. This group was noted for its historical ties with the apartheid regime. In response to criticism, Civita said he chose this alternative rather than to capitalize the publishing arm from Grupo Abril. He did not want to submit his long-term vision to satisfy quarterly results for shareholders. Civic life Civita has been active in foundations and non-profits related to education: he was chairman of the board of Abril Educa√ß√£o, and chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Victor Civita Foundation. Maintaining ties to the University of Pennsylvania, he has participated in leadership of the Lauder Institute and the Wharton Advisory Board. In addition to serving as a member of the Board of Governance of the Instituto Millenium, Civita was on the Board of Overseers of the International Center for Economic Growth (founded in 1985 with headquarters in Panama).

The term Bath Blitz refers to the air raids by the German Luftwaffe on the British city of Bath, Somerset, during World War II. The city was bombed in April 1942 as part of the so-called \\"Baedeker raids\\", in which targets were chosen for their cultural and historical, rather than their strategic or military, value. Background Bath was largely untouched during the Blitz, the German night bombing offensive against Britain's cities, though nearby Bristol was bombed severely throughout that period. Bath was subject to numerous air raid warnings as raiders flew overhead on their way to Bristol, but no bombs were dropped on Bath at this point. This changed in April 1942 with the start of the Baedeker Blitz, mounted in response to a step-change in the effectiveness of the RAF's bombing offensive in March 1942, that resulted in the destruction of the city of L√ºbeck. The Blitz Over the weekend of 25‚Äì27 April 1942, Bath suffered three raids, from 80 Luftwaffe aircraft which took off from Nazi occupied northern France. As the city sirens wailed, few citizens took cover, even when the first pathfinder flares fell. The people of Bath still believed the attack was destined for nearby Bristol. During the previous four months, Bristol had been hit almost every night, so the people of Bath did not expect the bombs to fall on them. The first raid struck just before 11 pm on the Saturday night and lasted until 1 am. The German aircraft then returned to France, refuelled, rearmed and returned at 4.35 am. Bath was still on fire from the first raid, making it easier for the German bombers to pick out their targets. The third raid, which only lasted two hours but caused extensive damage, commenced in the early hours of Monday morning. The bombers flew low to drop their high explosives and incendiaries, and then returned to rake the streets with machine-gun fire. Effects 417 people were killed, another 1,000 injured. Over 19,000 buildings were affected, of which 1,100 were seriously damaged or destroyed, including 218 of architectural or historic interest. Houses in the Royal Crescent, Circus and Paragon were destroyed and the Assembly Rooms were burnt out. A high explosive bomb landed on the south side of Queen Square, resulting in houses on the south side being damaged. The Francis Hotel lost of its hotel frontage, and most of the buildings on Queen Square suffered some level of shrapnel damage. Casualties on the Square were low, considering the devastation, with the majority of hotel guests and staff having taken shelter in the hotel's basement. The majority of Bath's churches were greatly damaged, including St James Church on Stall Street and St Andrew's Church, both of which had to be demolished; the St James site is now a retail building and the St Andrew's site is now a park. Many buildings have subsequently been restored, or otherwise have been replaced by different buildings or a new land use (such as a park), although there are still some signs of the bombing. Legacy Willi Schludecker at the 25 April 2008 memorial service in Bath, with his remembrance wreath. After the raid, an air- raid shelter was provided for Queen Square occupants in the then private central garden. In 1948, the residents gave the garden to the people of Bath with the intention it would become a memorial to the victims of the enemy attacks. Today the square plays host to a variety of community activities, including the Jane Austen Festival and the annual Bath Boules Tournament. Willi Schludecker, 87, who flew more than 120 sorties for the Luftwaffe, including the Bath Blitz, travelled to the UK as part of Bath's annual remembrance service on Friday 25 April 2008.\\"Luftwaffe pilot sorry for bombing\\". BBC News. 23 April 2008. Retrieved 7 September 2010. Willi Schludecker died in a hospital in Cologne on 17 June 2010, at the age of 90. Among the firefighters assigned to the scene in Bath was Harry Patch, who in the 2000s became the last surviving British Army veteran from the First World War. In 2016, a live bomb was discovered by workmen under the playground of the former Royal High School, Bath site. The bomb, which had remained undiscovered for over 70 years, was made safe by a bomb disposal team before being removed to the Torr Works quarry and blown up. References * Grayling, A. C.

He was born at Darling Point to solicitor William Hall Mant and Frances Gordon, n√©e McCrae, a granddaughter of Georgiana McCrae. His godfather was A. B. Paterson. Mant attended Sydney Grammar School and from 1914 worked in Queensland as a station hand. He enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 11 April 1916 and sailed for England in May, attached to the Cyclist Training Battalion. He served in France with the 3rd Divisional Cyclist Company from December 1916 and then with the 1st Infantry Battalion from January 1917. Promoted lieutenant in February 1918 and mentioned in despatches in 1919, he remained in Britain after the war to study law at the University of Edinburgh before returning to Sydney, receiving his Bachelor of Law from the University of Sydney in 1924. His appointment with the AIF was formally terminated on 23 July 1920. On 30 October 1924, Mant was admitted as a solicitor by the New South Wales Supreme Court and began working for Ellison, Rich & Son. In 1927 he became a partner with Frank A. Davenport & Mant, which established an expertise in insurance and liquor licensing. He married widowed clerk associate Helen Musgrave Dalziel on 29 October 1931 at Darling Point. He returned to active service for World War II on 17 March 1941, first with the Citizen Military Forces and then, from 28 July 1942, as a captain in the AIF. In September 1942 he was promoted major and in October 1943 lieutenant colonel, becoming chief legal officer of the First Australian Army from 1942 to 1943 and of the Second from 1944 to 1945. On 14 February 1946 he was moved to the Reserve of Officers. Mant was also active politically as a founding member of the Liberal Party of Australia. He was the Liberal candidate for the safe Labor seats of West Sydney in 1946 and East Sydney in 1949, and served as chair of the Vaucluse branch of the party from 1950 to 1976.

He was born at St Pancras in London to chemist Alfred George Mason and Winnie, n√©e Wheeldon. He attended Eriva Deene School, St Clement's Mixed School and Bournemouth School before attending the University of London (Bachelor of Science 1943, Master of Science 1946), winning first-class honours in mathematics and physics. From 1943 to 1946 he was employed at the Ministry of Supply studying the military applications of quartz crystals, and in 1945 he became an associate member of the Institute of Physics. He married Sheila Mabelle Clegg at Bournemouth on 7 June 1945; Mason was a committed pacifist, which went well with his wife's Quaker faith, although he did not become a Quaker himself. Mason and his wife were early supporters of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. From 1946 to 1953 Mason worked with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and from 1953 to 1961 with the British Rubber Producers' Research Association. He received his PhD in 1960 with a thesis on the visco-elasticity of strained rubber, and in 1962 moved to Australia to study keratin on a post-doctoral fellowship with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Sydney, becoming principal research officer. Mason was appointed foundation professor of physics at Macquarie University in 1966 and gave the university's first undergraduate lecture in 1967. In the late 1970s he designed and taught a postgraduate course in biophysics, one of his research areas. He served two terms on the university council (1974-77, 1980-86). He was also involved in politics, opposing the Vietnam War and standing as a Senate candidate for the Australian Reform Movement in 1967. In 1986 Mason was elected a fellow of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science, and from 1966 to 1986 he was on the council of the Australian Institute of Nuclear Science and Engineering. He served on the founding council of Griffith University from 1971 to 1977 and as a councillor of the Public Library of New South Wales from 1971 to 1975. From 1983 to 1986 he convened the advisory council of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), and he remained active in pacifist causes, notably Scientists Against Nuclear Arms. He had become a science broadcaster on the ABC in the 1970s, presenting a series of \\"Science Show\\" programs from 1978 to 1985 including \\"Blood and Iron\\", which won him (together with Robyn Williams and Halina Szewczyk) a United Nations media peace prize gold citation. He published a book on probability, Half Your Luck, in 1986 and published seventy scientific papers during his career. Mason was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 1985 and retired an emeritus professor from Macquarie University in 1986. He died at Wahroonga on 20 March 1987 and was survived by his wife and three children. Macquarie University still runs the general science courses he designed and awards the Peter Mason prize for outstanding achievement in them annually.

Methodology In writing the exegesis, Al-Modarresi seeks to rely on the purpose of each verse in its contemporary use in the society. Al-Modarresi tries not to engage in technical discussion and rather emphasize on the educational aspects of each verse. Exegesis of each verse ends with a survey of narrations (hadiths) on that verse. Al-Modarresi presents his comments by first mentioning a group of verses. He then describes the meanings of words that were borrowed from Majma' al-Bayan. He will then go over the morals of the verse and concludes it with new social issues that might relate to the verse.

He was born at Dongara in Western Australia to tailor Archibald Hector Cranston McEachern and Lillian Emma, n√©e Dumbrell. He attended Brisbane Grammar School and was admitted as a solicitor on 2 May 1928, establishing his own firm. He joined the Australian Field Artillery militia in 1924 and by 1936 was a major commanding the 11th Field Brigade. He married Clarice Jean Lynagh Smith on 24 April 1936 at Brisbane, but they separated in January 1940 and were subsequently divorced. McEachern remarried clerk Hazel Lawson Lyon on 17 October 1940 in Brisbane. He was promoted lieutenant colonel in February 1937. After the outbreak of World War II McEachern gave up his law firm and joined the Australian Imperial Force on 1 May 1940 as a major. In October 1940 he was again promoted lieutenant colonel and was given command of the 2/4th Anti-Tank Regiment, which was sent to Malaya with the 8th Division. Fighting against the Japanese from 27 December 1941, the unit was still in place at the surrender on 15 February 1942; McEachern's superior officer reported that he was \\"an inspiration to his Regiment owing to his outstanding ability, command and control which were exercised without regard for personal safety\\"; he would receive the Distinguished Service Order for his actions in 1947. As a prisoner of war, McEachern commanded \\"D\\" force, which was sent to work on the Burma-Thailand Railway in March 1943. Promoted colonel and temporary brigadier from April 1942, he commanded 5000 Australian and British troops on the railway. He was the senior Allied officer in Thailand at the Japanese surrender in August 1945 and oversaw the repatriation of 30,000 troops. He overstepped his authority to countermand Allied officers to concentrate prisoners in the Bangkok area as he knew many prisoners would not survive the long march. Mentioned in despatches, he was formally transferred to the Reserve of Officers on 19 February 1946 as an honorary brigadier. Cranston McEachern & Co. became a major law firm when McEachern returned from the war. He stood as a Senate candidate for the Services Party of Australia at the 1946 federal election, and was president of the Queensland branch of the United Service Institute from 1946 to 1961. From 1964 to 1969 he was president of the Young Men's Christian Association of Brisbane and from 1966 to 1970 was honorary colonel of the Australian Cadet Corps, Northern Command.

It has historically been employed in cases of suspected infanticide to help determine whether or not an infant was stillborn. In the test, lungs that float in water are thought to have been aerated, while those that sink are presumed to indicate an absence of air. The test is not infallible and many factors can cause the test to give false positive or negative results. Decomposition may result in postmortem gas formation, allowing a non-aerated lung to float. During labor, air can be introduced to a deceased infant's lungs while moving through the birth canal. Lungs exposed to air do not always float. Gro√üe Ostendorf et al. showed the procedure gave a false result in 2% of cases. In a 1997 paper, J.J. Moar emphasises the risk of misdiagnosing live birth, writing that the \\"majority of new born infants seen at autopsy show signs of varying degrees of decomposition, as they are often found in garbage, wrapped in newspaper or plastic bags, or lying in an open field. Even microscopic putrefaction can cause unexpanded lungs to float, when gas formation may not be macroscopically apparent. Naturally, any attempts at resuscitation may partially expand the lungs of a new born infant, leading to further difficulty in establishing live birth.\\" The difference between the lungs of a foetus and those of an infant was noted by the Ancient Greek physician Galen. The lung float test was described in the 1670s by Hungarian botanist K√°roly Rayger and first performed in 1681. German physician Johannes Schreyer performed a lung float test in 1690. The application of the lung float test to determine breathing and live birth has many medico-legal considerations. In South Africa a foetus must have breathed to be considered a person under the law. Lung float tests are also used by forensic pathologists to determine if a subject drowned.

He was born at Camperdown in Sydney to hairdresser Patrick James McGahen and Monica Marie Anderson, n√©e Pettit. After attending De La Salle College Ashfield, he received a Bachelor of Social Studies from the University of Sydney in 1974. As a student he opposed the Vietnam War, refusing to register for conscription; his advocacy of draft resistance led to his conviction for sedition. During this time he became a member of the Communist Party of Australia. From 1974 to 1975 he was a social worker and drug counsellor, and he became a founding member of the Australian Social Welfare Union in 1976. Working first on the methadone program with the Health Commission of New South Wales, he also worked for the State Department of Youth and Community Services and in the 1980s reviewed the New South Wales Family Support Services Scheme. In the mid-1970s, McGahen became involved in the campaign for gay rights as a member of Sydney Gay Liberation and the Socialist Lesbians & Male Homosexuals. He was an organiser for the National Homosexual Conference in 1978 and served as chairman of the Sydney Mardi Gras Association from 1981 to 1984. He stood as the Communist candidate for Lord Mayor of Sydney in 1980 without success. In 1984, together with fellow Communist Jack Mundey he was elected as an independent to Sydney City Council, serving until the council's dismissal on 26 March 1987. He was the first openly gay member of the council. McGahen became director of a home care service in 1986, and he supported extended care to AIDS sufferers, spousal immigration rights, and a permanent LGBT community centre. He joined the Pride steering committee in 1989 and became treasurer. In 1987 he had been diagnosed with HIV, and chose voluntary euthanasia. He died at Elizabeth Bay on 3 April 1990, and was cremated. In 1992 he was posthumously inducted into the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Association Hall of Fame.

It was introduced in 1938 by Dmitri Ivanenko and re-introduced and investigated in 1970 by Mario Soler as a toy model of self-interacting electron. This model is described by the Lagrangian density :\\\\mathcal{L}=\\\\overline{\\\\psi} \\\\left(i\\\\partial\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!/-m \\\\right) \\\\psi + \\\\frac{g}{2}\\\\left(\\\\overline{\\\\psi} \\\\psi\\\\right)^2 where g is the coupling constant, \\\\partial\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!/=\\\\sum_{\\\\mu=0}^3\\\\gamma^\\\\mu\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x^\\\\mu} in the Feynman slash notations, \\\\overline{\\\\psi}=\\\\psi^*\\\\gamma^0.

Features=Internal symmetry= Besides the unitary symmetry U(1), in dimensions 1, 2, and 3 the equation has SU(1,1) global internal symmetry. =Renormalizability= The Soler model is renormalizable by the power counting for k=1 and in one dimension only, and non-renormalizable for higher values of k and in higher dimensions. =Solitary wave solutions= The Soler model admits solitary wave solutions of the form \\\\phi(x)e^{-i\\\\omega t}, where \\\\phi is localized (becomes small when x is large) and \\\\omega is a real number. =Reduction to the massive Thirring model= In spatial dimension 2, the Soler model coincides with the massive Thirring model, due to the relation (\\\\bar\\\\psi\\\\psi)^2=J_\\\\mu J^\\\\mu, with \\\\bar\\\\psi\\\\psi=\\\\psi^*\\\\sigma_3\\\\psi the relativistic scalar and J^\\\\mu=(\\\\psi^*\\\\psi,\\\\psi^*\\\\sigma_1\\\\psi,\\\\psi^*\\\\sigma_2\\\\psi) the charge-current density.

It has been the seat of the Bishop of Eisenstadt since the creation of the diocese in 1960.  History  The first reference to a chapel dedicated to Saint Martin of Tours occurs in 1264, when Eisenstadt received its original name, in , in and in (\\"Little Martin's village\\"). From this chapel there are still remains of a Romanesque foundation in the area of the present choir. In the 13th century the chapel was extended by the addition of an early Gothic choir. In the 14th century a chapel for lay people was added. In 1460 the church was rebuilt under the town captain Johann Siebenhirter as a fortified or defensive church, as an attack by the Turks was expected after the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. The Gothic building was finished in 1522. After the great fire of 1589 almost 30 years passed before construction of the severely damaged church took place, between 1610 and 1629. In 1777 a large altarpiece by Stefan Dorffmeister was added, depicting \\"The Transfiguration of St. Martin\\". In the following year the Viennese organ builder Malleck installed an organ to instructions from Joseph Haydn. After the creation of the Diocese of Eisenstadt, St. Martin's Church was elevated to the rank of cathedral in 1960. Saint Martin became the patron saint of the diocese and the Land. Under Bishop Stephan L√°szl√≥ in 1960 the interior and windows were renewed. In 2003 under Bishop Paul Iby the cathedral was remodelled to designs by the architects Lichtblau-Wagner. The service of consecration on 12 April 2003 and the dedication of the altar marked the end of the renovation after a year's construction work.  Works of art  The architecture of the interior was altered in 1960 to plans by Jakob Adelhart. The windows of the presbytery reflect the theme of Christ the King and are by Franz De√©d. The windows of the nave depict motifs from the Revelation of St John the Divine and are by Margret Bilger. In 1980 Thomas Resetarits created a figure of the Virgin of Mercy, which was set on the main portal. Gilbert Bretterbauer made the carpet in 2003, which matches the colours of the windows. The altar space was re-designed by Brigitte Kowanz in 2003, and is marked by its use of glass.  Church music  The cathedral is famous for its church music. Concerts of the annual Haydn Festival also take place here. The organ was built in 1778 by Johann Gottfried Malleck from Vienna thanks to an endowment by the widow Theresia Frigl. A new build was necessary as the old organ had been badly damaged during earlier repairs. Significant alterations to the organ were carried out in 1944 by the organ builders Karl Schuke of Berlin: the range of the pedals and of the first manual were extended, and a register was added. The last restoration, also by Schuke, took place in 1973, during which all the additions from 1944 were removed and re-constructed, together with the pedal windchest, the pedal woodwind register and the fa√ßade. A particular feature of the instrument is that while it still retains Baroque elements, there is much that anticipates the sound aesthetic which finally prevailed in the early 19th century.see Orgel  Notes and references  External links  * Eisenstadt Cathedral Roman Catholic cathedrals in Austria Cathedral Catholic Diocese of Eisenstadt ","title":"Eisenstadt Cathedral"},{"id":"38549308","text":"Cortinarius smithii is an agaric fungus of the genus Cortinarius.

She was educated at Pakenham State School before winning a scholarship to Melbourne Continuation School, returning to Pakenham as an assistant teacher in 1910. She soon enrolled in the University of Melbourne as an arts student, and by September 1914 was teaching at Faraday Street State School in Carlton. In 1916 she moved to secondary teaching and worked at Echuca High School; she would spend the next thirty-four years as a teacher in a number of schools. She was also a political activist, joining the Australian Student Christian Movement and the Student Peace Group in 1914, and the Free Religious Fellowship in the 1920s. In 1935 she joined the Movement Against War and Fascism and was a founding member of the Teachers' Peace Movement. McRae was also active in teachers' unions, serving on the Victorian Teachers' Union council from 1934 (vice- president 1941-47). She was deeply involved in the establishment of an independent tribunal for teachers in 1946 and supported the VTU affiliating with the Trades Hall Council and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. She became headmistress of Flemington Girls High School in 1942, and served on the Victorian committee of the Women's Charter Conference and the Council for Women in War Work during the Second World War. From 1929 to 1930 she had gone on exchange to Scotland, and she travelled to Vancouver, England and the Soviet Union in 1937 as part of the Pan Pacific Women's Conference. She joined the Communist Party of Australia and the Australian-Soviet Friendship League on her return to Australia. McRae's communist affiliations led her activities to be watched closely by the Commonwealth Investigation Service, and she was the subject of heated debate in the Victorian Parliament in 1946. Defeated for VTU office in 1948, a relentless anti-communist campaign saw her retire from teaching in poor health in 1950. She stood as a Communist candidate for the federal seat of Henty in 1951, but subsequently focused more on women's issues as a foundation member of the Union of Australian Women (1950).

On 28 December 2015 he was elected the new Speaker of the Croatian Parliament for its 8th Assembly with 88 votes in favor, 62 abstentions and 1 vote against.

During the same session of Parliament, however, Reiner was once again elected as one of the Deputy Speakers from the ranks of the governing parliamentary majority. =Second deputy speakership and temporary assumption of presidential powers and duties= In his capacity as a Deputy Speaker of Parliament, Reiner temporarily assumed the powers and duties of the President of Croatia on 11 July 2018 when, due to the rare simultaneous absence of both President Kolinda Grabar-Kitaroviƒá, who was attending the 2018 NATO summit in Brussels, and Speaker of Parliament Gordan Jandrokoviƒá, who (along with Prime Minister Andrej Plenkoviƒá) was attending the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup in Moscow, he was left as the highest-ranking official eligible to take up the responsibility. Namely, the Constitution of Croatia allows the President of the Republic to temporarily delegate his or her powers and duties to the Speaker of Parliament during periods of absence, illness or incapacity, while the Speaker himself is likewise authorized by Article 34 of the rule book of Parliament to further delegate his or her own powers and duties to the Deputy Speakers from the parliamentary majority. As the other two eligible Deputy Speakers, Milijan Brkiƒá (HDZ) and Furio Radin (Italian national minority), were both also absent from the country, Reiner was left as the only possible choice to carry out the functions of head of state. Upon Jandrokoviƒá's return to Croatia the following day, Reiner ceased to carry out the powers and duties of the presidency, which reverted to the Speaker.  Croatian War of Independence  Reiner was a volunteer in the Croatian War of Independence from the early days of its on-set.

Goehr's work focuses on the history of aesthetic theory, attempting to understand the relational nature of norms and power dynamics with the structure that confines them and regulates their practice. Most of her work has focused on the musical arts, and some of it has explored the complicated and often hostile relationship between the various arts, and between the arts and philosophy and religion. She has also engaged with ideas about violence in the arts from a critical theory standpoint, as well as dealt with the philosophy of history and the history of philosophy. Awards Goehr has received several awards for her research as well as for her teaching of undergraduate students and mentoring of graduate students. She has been a recipient of the Getty and Guggenheim Fellowships. In 2012, Goehr was awarded the H. Colin Slim Award by the American Musicological Society.

It depicts Christ and seven disciples entering Jerusalem to the acclaim of its inhabitants. Description This fresco is in the Romanesque style popular in northern Spain during the twelfth century. The life-size figures, extending the entire height of the fresco, are marked by curvilinear patterning, schematic drapery folds, and repeated figures creating abstract designs. Jesus, riding an ass and her foal, raises his hands to bless the multitudes come to greet his arrival. These multitudes have been condensed to two kneeling figures spreading branches before him. Historical information San Baudelio was constructed in the eleventh century, but the frescoes were not added for another century. There are two distinct cycles: the upper walls were covered in colorful scenes from Christ's life, while the lower walls depicted hunt scenes and exotic animals indicative of the Islamic influence in the region. While the two sets of images have very different subjects, there are many indications that they were created simultaneously, by artists from the same atelier if not the very same artist. The frescoes have a similar quality of line, and the draftsmanship of various human and animal figures seems related. They were also created using the same techniques: initial sketches in buon fresco and fresco-secco, details added in tempera, polished with limewater. Although seemingly at odds, the two sets of frescoes, religious and secular, worked together quite well considering the time and place of their creation. The unstable border between Christian and Muslim regions saw much interpenetration of ideas and people. The Mozarabic people in the region, who practiced Christianity with the trappings of Arab culture, would have been ideally served by San Baudelio's mixture of cultures and iconographies. =Location history= The remoteness of Berlanga de Duero and inaccessibility of its church helped the frescoes survive for centuries, protecting them from everything but the weather. In 1927, the villagers of Berlanga sold the frescoes that had not been destroyed to an art dealer named Leon Levi. They were then dispersed to museums around the world, including the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Cincinnati Art Museum, and the Prado Museum. =Acquisition= The IMA acquired Entry of Christ into Jerusalem in 1957 as a gift of G. H. A. Clowes and Elijah B. Martindale. It was given the accession number 57.151 and hangs in the Irving M. Fauvre Gallery by its sister fresco, Marriage at Cana.

It is primarily a platform for familial militarism, love of personality cults, leadership, classism and honor, pride in work ethic, seasonal harvests or festivals[relevant?], kinship bonds between religious groups or orders and patrilineal lineage, and pride for national symbolism, origin and founding myth, heroism and saints. It is similar to the disdain in expansionist nationalism towards all foreign nations and outsiders. A noteworthy exception is many nationalists believe in peace through marriage between social groups. It is the nationalism \\"which does not allow the rational nature of the human mind to assert itself\\". It was used to explain the totalitarian and authoritarian regimes in the Interwar period, which eventually led to World War II. The term is sometimes associated with American expansionism.

She was probably born at Liverpool in England, the daughter of storeman David Smith and Wilhelmina Fletcher, n√©e McLean. The family moved to South Australia in 1911, settling in the suburbs of Birkenhead and Largs Bay North. She was educated at state schools and graduated from Adelaide High School in 1927 before studying at the University of Adelaide (Bachelor of Arts, 1930; Master of Arts, 1932), becoming a schoolteacher. As a teacher she became interested in \\"problem children\\", working as an honorary probation officer with the Children's Court. In 1938 she was given a free passage to England to begin doctoral research in psychology at the Victoria University of Manchester on \\"the mental readjustment of the problem child\\". World War II disrupted Smith's career and she returned to Adelaide in 1940. On her return Smith became assistant psychologist with the Department of Education, becoming departmental psychologist in 1942. She resigned in 1944 after campaigning vigorously and controversially for better salaries for female teachers, and established a private practice, becoming well known for her column in the Sunday Mail (1944-1969). She returned to the Victoria University of Manchester after winning the Catherine Helen Spence scholarship in 1945, studying \\"modern trends in child psychology and work with adolescents\\". She was the first South Australian woman to stand for the Senate, as an ungrouped independent at the 1949 federal election, she was unsuccessful. Full-time child psychologist at the Adelaide Children's Hospital from 1953, Smith made progress with direct play therapy and was involved in the special education branch of the Department of Education. Considered a pioneering South Australian psychologist, she took a mentalistic approach which became outdated as behaviouralism came into vogue. She was also active in the community as president of the Young Women's Christian Association of Adelaide from 1950 to 1951. She died at North Adelaide in 1989.

The Pathare Prabhus had settled in Mumbai, and the region thereabout in the 13th century, and gained prosperity during the development of Bombay by the British in the 18th century. The Pathare Prabhu Kancholes are a few hundred in number, and this section came into existence, within the major caste, in the year 1777, over a quarrel on the occasion of a marriage ceremony in the caste. This smaller section of the main caste is known as Kanchole Pathare Prabhus, as the dispute leading to the schism in the original caste had centred about a kanchole, i.e. a small vessel used for holding sandalwood paste for the purpose of anointing, in honour, the foreheads of guests. Division The incident causing the split in the greater Pathare Prabhu caste occurred in the year 1777, when, during the marriage ceremony in the caste, a small boy assigned the job of anointing the guests' foreheads with sandalwood paste failed to do so in case of a one elderly guest. The guest took that delinquency on the part of the boy as a deliberate attempt of insult, and cursed outrageously at the boy, on which the boy, out of boyish rage, threw away the kanchole in hand, which, by accident, struck another guest. In the ensuing mayhem different members of the community took either the side of the boy, or the side against him. The side against the boy being larger in number decided, on the spot, in the heat of the moment, to sever the relations with the boy-supporting smaller group.Pratap Velkar. Pathare Prabhuncha Itihas. Shree Vidhya Prakashan, Pune 1997 The estrangement between the two groups only grew as the time passed, and due to their separation from the bigger community the smaller faction was unable to arrange suitable marriages for its members for the next 60 years, because of which its number shrank to the 300 from the original 400. Thereafter this \\"Kanchole\\" faction imperatively had to scatter in the nearby regions, marrying with the women from the other Suryavanshi and Somvanshi castes of Mumbai, and nearby areas. The smaller group had no qualm in retaining their original culture, customs, festivals and food habits, family goddess, and gotra, which they have been retaining till date. Both the Kancholes and the non-Kancholes consider themselves to be the true Pathare Prabhus, as each of the groups is a faction of the original community, which divided on the pretext of a quarrel in the marriage ceremony, wherein all the members of the caste were invited as per the custom of that time. In 1929 Sri Shankaracharya (Dr. Kurtkoti,who was the Shankaracharya that time), in the role of the arbitrator that had assigned him by both the groups, had produced a written religious instruction in favour of the unification of both the groups. However, his instruction was turned down by the larger group out of impudence derived from the majority status held by them,. Although the larger group had previously used the Shankaracharya's rulings to counter their being labeled as Shudra by the Peshwas. The Kanchole faction's requests and appeals from 1824-1929, for bringing the relations within the community back to normal, were rejected by the larger group from time to time. Current situation Currently the Pathare Prabhus Kancholes are numbering 800 to 1000, and this number consists of with the property owners, high ranked politician, businessmen and skilled professionals. The Kanchole faction does not claim, what they consider to be their justifiable right, to a 30% share in the community's property, which is being withheld by the larger Pathare Prabhu group from the time of the division, considering the Kancholes were 15% of the total number at the time of the division, and more than 50% of the withheld property has been disposed of by the larger group in the recent past. Due to small number the Kancholes continue to marry into the other Maharashtrian communities of the claimed Kshatriya lineage, including the larger group; so do the larger Pathare Prabhu group due to their depleting number.

In quantum field theory, the nonlinear Dirac equation is a model of self-interacting Dirac fermions. This model is widely considered in quantum physics as a toy model of self-interacting electrons. The nonlinear Dirac equation appears in the Einstein-Cartan-Sciama-Kibble theory of gravity, which extends general relativity to matter with intrinsic angular momentum (spin).Dennis W. Sciama, \\"The physical structure of general relativity\\". Rev. Mod. Phys. 36, 463-469 (1964).Tom W. B. Kibble, \\"Lorentz invariance and the gravitational field\\". J. Math. Phys. 2, 212-221 (1961). This theory removes a constraint of the symmetry of the affine connection and treats its antisymmetric part, the torsion tensor, as a variable in varying the action. In the resulting field equations, the torsion tensor is a homogeneous, linear function of the spin tensor. The minimal coupling between torsion and Dirac spinors thus generates an axial-axial, spin‚Äìspin interaction in fermionic matter, which becomes significant only at extremely high densities. Consequently, the Dirac equation becomes nonlinear (cubic) in the spinor field, which causes fermions to be spatially extended and may remove the ultraviolet divergence in quantum field theory. Models Two common examples are the massive Thirring model and the Soler model. =Thirring model= The Thirring model was originally formulated as a model in (1 + 1) space-time dimensions and is characterized by the Lagrangian density : \\\\mathcal{L}= \\\\overline{\\\\psi}(i\\\\partial\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!/-m)\\\\psi -\\\\frac{g}{2}\\\\left(\\\\overline{\\\\psi}\\\\gamma^\\\\mu\\\\psi\\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\overline{\\\\psi}\\\\gamma_\\\\mu \\\\psi\\\\right), where is the spinor field, is the Dirac adjoint spinor, :\\\\partial\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!/=\\\\sum_{\\\\mu=0,1}\\\\gamma^\\\\mu\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x^\\\\mu}\\\\,, (Feynman slash notation is used), is the coupling constant, is the mass, and are the two-dimensional gamma matrices, finally is an index. =Soler model= The Soler model was originally formulated in (3 + 1) space-time dimensions. It is characterized by the Lagrangian density :\\\\mathcal{L}=\\\\overline{\\\\psi} \\\\left(i\\\\partial\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!/-m \\\\right) \\\\psi + \\\\frac{g}{2}\\\\left(\\\\overline{\\\\psi} \\\\psi\\\\right)^2, using the same notations above, except :\\\\partial\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!/=\\\\sum_{\\\\mu=0}^3\\\\gamma^\\\\mu\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x^\\\\mu}\\\\,, is now the four-gradient operator contracted with the four-dimensional Dirac gamma matrices , so therein . Einstein-Cartan theory In Einstein-Cartan theory the Lagrangian density for a Dirac spinor field is given by (c=\\\\hbar=1) :\\\\mathcal{L}=\\\\sqrt{-g}\\\\bigl(\\\\overline{\\\\psi} \\\\left(i\\\\gamma^\\\\mu D_\\\\mu-m \\\\right) \\\\psi\\\\bigr), where :D_\\\\mu=\\\\partial_\\\\mu + \\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\omega_{ u\\\\rho\\\\mu}\\\\gamma^ u \\\\gamma^\\\\rho is the Fock-Ivanenko covariant derivative of a spinor with respect to the affine connection, \\\\omega_{\\\\mu u\\\\rho} is the spin connection, g is the determinant of the metric tensor g_{\\\\mu u}, and the Dirac matrices satisfy :\\\\gamma^\\\\mu \\\\gamma^ u + \\\\gamma^ u \\\\gamma^\\\\mu = 2g^{\\\\mu u}I. The Einstein-Cartan field equations for the spin connection yield an algebraic constraint between the spin connection and the spinor field rather than a partial differential equation, which allows the spin connection to be explicitly eliminated from the theory. The final result is a nonlinear Dirac equation containing an effective \\"spin-spin\\" self- interaction, :i\\\\gamma^\\\\mu D_\\\\mu \\\\psi - m\\\\psi = i\\\\gamma^\\\\mu abla_\\\\mu \\\\psi + \\\\frac{3\\\\kappa}{8}(\\\\overline{\\\\psi}\\\\gamma_\\\\mu\\\\gamma^5\\\\psi)\\\\gamma^\\\\mu\\\\gamma^5\\\\psi - m\\\\psi = 0, where abla_\\\\mu is the general-relativistic covariant derivative of a spinor. The cubic term in this equation becomes significant at densities on the order of \\\\frac{m^2}{\\\\kappa}.

She was appointed to the San Francisco Civil Service Commission in the early 1960s, where she contributed to ending discrimination in city hiring and promotion of women and gays. Von Beroldingen served on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors from 1966 to 1977. Originally appointed by Mayor John Shelley, she was subsequently elected three times; she was the third woman ever to serve as a member of the board and the first woman to chair its Finance and Budget Committee. Von Beroldingen was the first woman appointed to the Board of the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District and was instrumental to the San Francisco Commission on the Status of Woman, an anti-workplace gender discrimination agency.

Taylor served as the President of Industrial Commission of New South Wales between 1942 and 1966. Background and early career He was born at Rylstone to farmer John Orchard Taylor and Helen Russell, n√©e Clarke. He attended Burwood Superior Public School before becoming a junior clerk with the State Department of the Attorney-General and of Justice in November 1912. He joined the Australian Labor Party at the age of seventeen and was active in the anti-conscription campaigns of 1916-17\\\\. He ran unsuccessfully for Ryde at the 1925 state election, but was expelled from 1927 to 1930. On his readmittance he was part of the Lang Labor faction, running for North Sydney as a Lang Labor candidate at the 1934 federal election. He was called to the Bar on 25 May 1934. He ran for the reunited Labor Party as the candidate for Martin in 1937. Career Taylor married shorthand writer Gwendoline Heather Cansdell on 16 June 1934 at Windsor. He continued to rise in Labor politics, partly through his connection to William McKell. He was appointed deputy director of the wartime Commonwealth security service in 1942 by the Curtin Labor government, for which he was barely qualified; McKell, as Premier, appointed him president of the Industrial Commission of New South Wales later the same year, again over the heads of more qualified candidates. He worked primarily through networking and bargaining, and his greatest success was the mutually satisfactory industrial relations for the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme. His pragmatism saw him well respected by the time he retired in 1966, enough to be employed as an independent arbitrator. As a judge Taylor was known for informality and boisterousness; he was said to have trained with boxer Les Darcy and often engaged in wrestling contests during luncheon. His Industrial Commission colleagues became increasingly distant from him and in 1955 his relationship with shady Bankstown contractor and journalist Ray Fitzpatrick tainted his name. Taylor was accused of turning a blind eye and, indeed, shielding Fitzpatrick from the law, and he probably leaked a document linking Labor MP Charles Morgan to immigration rackets in the 1930s, which was connected to Morgan's infamous case against Frank Browne. As an advocate for police awards, in 1946 he handed down the first award for the NSW Police Service; which subsequently enabled the expansion of police awards nationally. Taylor was awarded life membership of the Police Association of NSW. On 28 January 1955 Taylor appeared before the royal commission on espionage, where it was alleged that he had compromised the identity of a secret agent by passing information to the Communist Party of Australia. Although he was not indicted by the commission, he was reported on favourably to the Comintern and further inquiries suggested that the Fitzpatrick affair may not have been an isolated occurrence. He was increasingly ostracised but turned this towards settling disputes in remote areas of New South Wales, winning admiration for effective conciliation tactics. Personal life and latter years Following his retirement, he remained involved in industrial affairs. His wife died in 1970 and Taylor began work as a yardman, living at the Bundarra pub. He returned to Sydney with failing health and died at Mosman in 1982; he was survived by his two daughters.

Furman, Morton Memorial New Jersey: Stevens Institute of Technology, 1905, p. xi He attended his father's school in Boston after coming to the United States in 1859. At the age of fourteen he received an appointment and passed preliminary entrance exams for the United States Naval Academy before the academy discovered he was too young to complete entrance. He instead began working for insurance companies and was made Secretary-Treasurer of the New York Guaranty and Indemnity Company by 1872,Geoffrey Clark, History of Stevens Institute of Technology New Jersey: Jensen/Daniels, 2000, p. 60 he became superintendent shortly thereafter. He later became superintendent of the Bayonne and Greenville Gas Light Company and attended Stevens Institute of Technology earning his degree in Mechanical Engineering; he graduated in 1881. Humphreys had enough determination to finish the prescribed coursework in four years while attending class only two days a week, acting as superintendent of the Trinity Episcopal Church's Sunday school, Treasurer and Vestry of the congregation, trustee of the Bayonne Board of Education and foreman of the Bayonne Fire Department. In 1892 he founded Humphreys & Glasgow, Engineering, London and New York with Arthur G. Glasgow, also a Stevens alum. Humphreys continued his career with the Pintsch Lighting Company of New York, the United Gas Improvement Company, and the Weisbach Incandescent Gas Company. =Family= In April 1872 he married Miss Eva Guillandeu of Bergen Point, NJ. They had three children in total: Harold, Crombie and Dorothy Caroline Humphreys-Turnbull. In memory of his son Harold, who was also the first son of a Stevens alumnus to graduate from the college, he endowed the Harold Humphreys Scholarship in 1902. In memory of Crombie, who drowned with Harold in the Nile in 1901, the Crombie Humphreys Scholarship in 1904. In 1927, Alexander Crombie Humphreys lost a battle with cancer. His death came two years after serving as President of his Alma mater for a quarter of a century, and Chairman of the Board of Trustees for two years. The only immediate family member to outlive him was his daughter. Stevens Institute of Technology Following the death of Henry Morton in 1902, the Board of Trustees of Stevens Institute of Technology unanimously called upon Humphreys to serve his Alma mater as President. Prior to his presidency, Humphreys was elected a Trustee of the Institute on 23 December 1891 and served as chair of the Stevens Alumni Association from 1883 ‚Äì 1886. Humphreys developed the Institute as one of the first technical schools in the United States. At his inauguration in 1902 he outlined his plans for the university emphasizing that students must be \\"thoroughly and completely trained in the fundamentals required in the practice of their profession.\\" As an alum, Humphreys was known to stand by and defend the history of the school engaging in public retort with those who failed to recognize the Institute or family's contributions. =Expansion of Campus= During a dinner following his inauguration, Colonel Edwin A. Stevens, Jr., son of the school's founder Edwin A. Stevens, presented the Institute with a plot of land on which to construct a dormitory. Upon assuming the office of President, Humphreys requested of Andrew Carnegie the financial support to construct a new building.Geoffrey Clark, History of Stevens Institute of Technology New Jersey: Jensen/Daniels, 2000, p. 127 He followed this with an address to the Board of Trustees urging construction of the Morton Laboratory of Chemistry, a dormitory, a gymnasium and library ‚Äì a \\"crying need of the Institute\\". As a homage to his predecessor, Humphreys campaigned for the creation of the Morton Memorial Chemistry Laboratory and commissioned a book on Stevens' founding and its early years to be named in his honor. These initiatives were but foreshadowing of the growth Humphreys would bring to Stevens. By 1924 the campus grew from just over a city block to 23-acres, enrollment quadrupled and endowment grew to $2,864,000 (from $384,800 when Humprheys took office). That year also marked the successful end of the \\"Million Dollar Campaign,\\" which had attracted donations from alumni as well as George Eastman and Edward Harkness. In 1909, Stevens seized the opportunity to acquire Castle Point from Richard Stevens inclusive of the prominent Stevens Family Castle constructed in 1853; the purchase was primarily funded by the Carnegie Foundation and John D. Rockefeller Educational Fund. This came within months of acquiring the land adjacent to present-day 8th street upon which fraternity houses were constructed that stand to this day. In 1960 the Institute expanded again and constructed two residence halls, one of which bared his name. =Engineering Economics= During the growth of the Institute, Alexander C.

By 1908 the students created a self run Honor Board who was charged with investigating cases, bringing up charges, judging cases by a vote and recommend punishments to the faculty. Upon Humphreys' recommendation, faculty were also required to abide by such a pledge in administering exams within Honor Board guidelines on the grounds that it is a \\"...proviso apply[ing] to the examiner as well as to the student\\".

After his resignation he served in the Citizen Military Forces, becoming a major by 1929. He also studied law at the University of Sydney, receiving his Bachelor of Law in 1927. He married Marjorie Mary Mullins on 19 May 1927 at Vaucluse, converting to Anglicanism from congregationalism. Isaacs was called to the bar on 10 May 1928 and changed his name by deed poll in 1933 in order to counter anti-Semitism, although he was never Jewish. He was appointed King's Counsel in 1940, and wrote on Australian company law with Percy Spender and later with John Young. World War II saw him resumed service with the Citizen Military Forces and from 1942 with the Australian Imperial Force. He commanded an anti-aircraft battery in Sydney from 1940 to 1942 and was briefly posted to New Guinea and the Northern Territory. He was transferred to the reserve of officers as an honorary colonel in October 1944. In 1940 he had run as one of three United Australia Party candidates for the federal seat of Parramatta. Wallace appeared frequently before the High Court and often represented the New South Wales commissioner of stamp duties before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. From 1952 to 1953 he was a member of the Commonwealth committee on taxation and he appeared before the royal commission on liquor laws (1951-54) on behalf of Tooth & Co. From 1956 to 1958 he was president of the New South Wales Bar Association and in 1957 suggested the idea for the Australian Bar Association, founded in 1962. He was vice- president of the Law Council of Australia in 1957. Wallace was appointed a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in March 1960, and supported the creation of a Court of Appeal, becoming inaugural president in January 1966. He was knighted in 1968 and acting chief justice from 1 October 1968 to 3 February 1969; his swift rise in seniority earned him the ire of some colleagues. From 1960 to 1965 he was president of the International Law Association's Australian branch. He was also active in the community as president of the Australasian Pioneers' Club (1962-64), the University Club (1969-71) and the Elanora Country Club. In January 1970, having reached the statuary retirement age, he was instead called upon to preside over the 1970-74 royal commission into oil drilling on the Great Barrier Reef.

Hebrew Bible The term \\"throne\\" is used both literally and metonymically in the Hebrew Bible. As a symbol for kingship, the throne is seen as belonging to David, or to God Himself. In 1 Kings 1:37 Benaiah's blessing to Solomon was \\"may the LORD... make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David\\"; while in 1 Chronicles 29:23 we are told \\"Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king\\". Literally, the throne as Solomon's seat of state is described in 1 Kings 10: According to I Kings 7:7, Solomon's throne was placed in the Porch of Judgment, being actually an audience chamber where the king sat in judgment. Its floors were paved with cedar wood. In the Aramaic translation it is described as being an anteroom or vestibule, called \\"porch of the pillars.\\" =Judaism= A Jewish tradition holds that the throne was removed to Babylon, then Ahasuerus sat on the throne of Solomon.Alexei M. Sivertsev Judaism and Imperial Ideology in Late Antiquity 2011- Page 22 \\"The tradition that Ahasuerus sat on the throne of Solomon was already known by the mid-third century. ...

Tomson The Literature of the Sages -2006 Volume 2 - Page 182 \\"The teachings of the Babylonian rabbis... the allegorical significance of the six steps to the throne of Solomon; the throne in captivity (1:12);\\" According to the Targum Sheni of Megillat Esther, Solomon's throne was one of the earliest mechanical devices invented, with movable parts. When it was transferred to Persia some centuries later and used in the palace of Ahasuerus, it ceased to work. It has been described as a throne overlaid with gold, and studded with jewels; emeralds, cat's eye, the Baghdadi onyx, pearls and marble. It was ascended by many steps, the sides of which were aligned with twelve sculptured lions of gold, before whom were golden sculptures of eagles, the right paw of each lion set opposite the left wing of each eagle. As one approached the top of the staircase, there were another six steps directly in front of the semi-circular throne, each step with a pair of sculpted animals, each in gold; the first step having a couching bull opposite a lion; the second a wolf on its haunches opposite a sheep; the third a panther opposite a camel; the fourth an eagle opposite a peacock; the fifth a wildcat opposite a cock; the sixth a hawk opposite a pigeon. Above the throne was a seven-branched candlestick which afforded light, each branch bearing a sculpted image of the seven patriarchs: Adam (the first man), Noah, Shem, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Job among them. Above the throne was also a sculpted design showing seventy golden seats upon which sat the seventy members of the Sanhedrin, adjudicating in the presence of King Solomon. At the two sides of King Solomon's ears were fixed two fish of the sea. At the very top of Solomon's throne were fixed twenty-four golden wings that provided a protective shade and covering for the king, and whenever the king wished to ascend his throne, the bull on the first step would, by a movable, mechanical contraption, outstretch its forearm and place the king upon the second step, and so-forth, until he ascended the sixth step, upon which ascension mechanical eagles then descended and lifted-up the king, placing him upon his throne.  Christendom  Royal Throne at Aachen Cathedral, coronation seat of the Holy Roman Emperors The New Testament speaks only of the \\"throne of David,\\" as in the angel Gabriel's message in Luke 1:32 in relation to the Davidic line, and notably the Gospel of Luke gives the descent of Jesus via Nathan (son of David), not Solomon. In religious tradition the Seat of Wisdom in Roman Catholic tradition is associated with Solomon, and in art, such as the Lucca Madonna (van Eyck), which portrays the Virgin sitting on the throne of Solomon. A \\"Throne of Solomon\\" was also among the Solomonic objects of the Byzantine Court at Constantinople. The Throne of Charlemagne, or Royal Throne at Aachen (Aachener K√∂nigsthron) is a throne erected in the 790s by Charlemagne, as one of the fittings of his palatine chapel in Aachen. Until 1531, it served as the throne of the coronation of the Holy Roman Emperors and the King of the Romans, being used at a total of thirty-one coronations. As a result, especially in the eleventh century, it was referred to as the totius regni archisolum (\\"Archstool of the Whole Realm\\").Roth 2011, p. 38. Charlemagne himself was not crowned on this throne, but instead in the Old St. Peter's Basilica in Rome by Pope Leo III. The throne was modeled after the throne of Solomon. The Throne Chair of Denmark was also inspired by the throne of Solomon. Various depictions in sacred art such as stained glass windows, frescoes, and paintings depict the throne and the king. Islam The throne of Solomon featured both in Islamic commentary, and art, including mosque decoration.Finbarr Barry Flood The Great Mosque of Damascus: Studies on the Makings of an Umayad ...2001 - Page 85 \\"... manifestation of the golden vine-tree in such a context is, however, in connection with the fabled throne of Solomon.\\" The concept has given rise to various geographical names: * Ghasre Abu-Nasr (Abu-Nasr Palace) or Takht e Sulayman (Throne of Solomon), archeological remains in Shiraz, Iran * Takht-e Soleyman District (ÿ®ÿÆÿ¥ ÿ™ÿÆÿ™ ÿ≥ŸÑ€åŸÖÿßŸÜ, meaning the \\"Throne of Solomon\\"), district in West Azerbaijan, Iran * Takht-e SoleymƒÅn (ÿ™ÿÆÿ™ ÿ≥ŸÑ€åŸÖÿßŸÜ, Takht-e SoleymƒÅn, \\"Throne of Solomon\\") archaeological site in West Azarbaijan, Iran * Takht-e- Sulaiman Solomon's Throne (Urdu, Pashto : ÿ™ÿÆÿ™ ÿ≥ŸÑŸäŸÖÿßŸÜ, from Persian : \\"Solomon 's throne\\") peak in Balochistan * Takht-e-Sulaiman, Sulayman Mountain, peak in Osh, Kyrgyzstan * Throne of Solomon (Srinagar, Kashmir), Takht-i-Sulaiman, temple ruin on top of Koh-i-Sulaiman near Dal Lake The Peacock Throne of Shah Jahan was commissioned to underscore his position as the just king.

It is located within the plaza of Haram al-Sharif, which supports its eastern wall. Kursi, which means chair, is an odd name for a building, and possibly relates to the spur of the Rock against which it is erected. The building itself is undated, but is clearly a mid-16th century foundation, as the shape of the two shallow domes covering the building are associated with the Ottoman period.[Al-Natsheh, Yusuf, \\"Kursi Sulaiman (after 1017/1608),\\" in Auld S. & R.

The building has three facades visible from the Temple Mount and the eastern facade is integrated in the eastern wall of Haram al-Sharif compound.

He was born at Gosford to timber contractor Robert John White and Bertha, n√©e Davis. After attending Gosford Public School, he left at twelve and served in the junior cadets and worked for his father. He studied by correspondence with Sydney Technical College, qualifying through the Royal Sanitary Institute as a sanitary engineer. He worked as an inspector for Gosford and Moree shire councils before passing the local government and shire clerk's certificate. On 8 June 1915 he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force. He married schoolteacher Pauline Marjory Mason, daughter of the mayor of Gosford, on 15 November 1915, and embarked as a second lieutenant in January 1916 as part of reinforcements for the 4th Battalion. He was wounded at Pozi√®res in July and, after returning, rose to become the adjutant in July 1917. At Strazeele in April 1918 he reconnoitred the front line under heavy fire, winning the Military Cross and a mention in despatches. Promoted captain in September, his appointment was terminated on 5 April 1919. After the war, White returned to work with his father's timber business, moving the headquarters to Sydney. Based in Strathfield, he also bought a timber property near Gloucester and developed land at Terrigal, Wamberal and Forresters Beach. He owned several successful racehorses, which helped finance an opulent house built in 1936. He helped establish the British American Co-operation Movement for World Peace (which became the Australian-American Association) in July 1936, and served as federal and state president; he was significantly involved in the creation of the Australian-American Memorial in Canberra. White was also politically active, mainly in anti-Labor circles. He tried to persuade Roden Cutler to head a National and Services Movement, but instead launched the Liberal Democratic Party on 16 April 1943 with Stanley S. Crick. The LDP had fraught relations with the United Australia Party and its New South Wales successor the Democratic Party, but it never won seats at federal or state level. In December 1944 White was a founder of the Liberal Party of Australia and the LDP was dissolved in January 1945. Initially sitting on the provisional executive, he soon resigned in April 1945, standing as an independent for the federal seat of Warringah in 1954; this led to his expulsion from the Liberal Party. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1954, Commander in 1967 and knighted in 1969. He died in 1983 at North Sydney and was survived by his wife and two daughters, his son having been killed during World War II.

He was born at Bridgend in Kinross, Scotland, to coalminer John Easton Wright and Kathleen Florence, n√©e Jessop. The family moved to Sydney in 1911, living in Redfern and Hurstville. Tom left school at the age of thirteen and became a sheet-metal worker at Wunderlich Ltd, coming under the influence of socialist Paddy Drew, later a founder of the Communist Party of Australia. He joined the Sheet Metal Working Industrial Union of Australia in 1921 and in 1924 became a member of the state management committee, treasurer of the New South Wales branch, and a delegate to the Labor Council of New South Wales (1924-73). He joined the Australian Labor Party and became secretary of the Hurstville branch, but after joining the Communist Party of Australia in 1923 he was expelled from the ALP in 1925. The Bruce-Page government barred him from attending the 1927 Pan-Pacific Trade Union Congress in China, but he went instead to Moscow to a meeting with the Comintern. Within the CPA he supported Jack Kavanagh's faction, becoming general secretary of the CPA in 1925. Kavanagh's fall in 1929 saw him lose this position, although he escaped expulsion. He recanted his previous loyalties and was restored to the central committee in 1931, remaining a member until 1970. He met Mary Margaret Lamm, n√©e McAdam, at the Unemployed Workers' Movement in Glebe; she was widowed in 1931 and she lived with Wright for a decade before they were married on 23 January 1941 at Five Dock. He increasingly worked as a communist organiser with the unemployed and stood several times as a Communist candidate for state and federal parliament. In 1936 Wright was elected state secretary of the sheet-metal workers' union, and in 1937 became vice-president of the Labor Council of New South Wales. In 1940 he became federal president of the sheet-metal workers' union, and played a leading role in the amalgamation with the Sheet Metal Working Agricultural Implement and Stove Making Industrial Union, serving as federal president of that body. From 1973 it became known as the Amalgamated Metal Workers' Union; Wright was again state president from 1972 to 1973 and commonwealth vice- president from 1972 to 1974. He was a long-term delegate to the Australian Council of Trade Unions, having been involved in its foundation, and sat on the executive from 1939 to 1941 and from 1961 to 1965. Wright was key in persuading the Communist Party to support Aboriginal land rights, and he published a book, New Deal for the Aborigines, in 1939. He was involved in the campaigns for civil liberties in the 1930s and peace in the 1940s and 1950s, and supported equal pay for women. After criticising the conciliation commissioners during the 1949 coal strike he faced, but escaped, prosecution, and in 1953 he was elected to Sydney City Council as one of the first two communists (with Ron Maxwell) to sit on that body. He was defeated in 1959 after the elimination of proportional representation. He visited China in 1952 and Cuba in 1963. Both Wright and his wife left the Communist Party in 1970 after it distanced itself from the Soviet Union. Mary joined the Socialist Party of Australia, while Tom remained aloof from politics thereafter. Among his publications were We Defend Peace (1937), A Real Social Insurance Plan (1937), Lenin and the Trade Unions (1940), The Basic Wage (1943), World Trade Union Federation (1945), United Action Wins (1947), and Australians Visit People's China (1952). He died at Kogarah in 1981 and was survived by his wife and their son.

It is noted for its unique traditions which center on the reenactment of stories related to the municipality's history as well as the use of tons of gunpowder used in handcarved muskets in mock battles and other events. The carnival involves the participation of 12,000 residents in costume, most of which are dressed in outfits related to elements of the armies that fought in the Battle of Puebla. Mock battles related to this event are reenacted as well as a Romeo and Juliet story and the first Catholic wedding and baptism in Mexico. The event Parade passing by the municipal palace (hall) The Carnival of Huejotzingo is the only carnival of its kind and one of the most important in Mexico. Festivities start in the morning of the Saturday before Ash Wednesday and end in the evening of Shrove Tuesday, with the most important days being Monday and Tuesday. About 12,000 people of the municipality participate in costume, most which carry hand carved muskets, with which gunpowder is set off. The activities of this carnival focus on a number of reenactments, although other elements such as ‚Äúhuehue‚Äù (meaning old person) dancers also exists. Festivities are daytime, beginning in the morning, with a break for a main meal in the mid afternoon and then continuing until nightfall. There are pre Hispanic elements to this carnival, including the mock battles which have been compared to the ‚Äúflower wars‚Äù of the Aztecs. Carnival coincides with the time that the pre Hispanic inhabitants of Huejotzingo petitioned the gods for fertility of the lands and for abundant rainfall. The carnival is led by a ‚ÄúGeneral en Jefe de las Fuerzas o Ejercicios Carnavalesco‚Äù who is in charge of leading all four days of festivities. S/he is selected at a meeting which occurs just after the end of the current year's carnival. Participants can prepare for up to six months in advance. The garments are still locally made, if not by the participants, then by local craftspeople. Children are also part of the festivities, with their own costumes and small muskets. The carnival attracts between 32,000 and 35,000 spectators from both Mexico and abroad, bringing about ten million pesos to the municipality. The carnival is also the beginning of the Tianguis Tur√≠stico (Tourism Market) . The reenactments Firing muskets The Corregidor's Daughter on horseback This carnival is unique in Mexico as it revolves around three major historical/legendary events for the region, the Battle of Puebla, the abduction of the Daughter of the Corregidor and the first Catholic wedding in Mexico. The reenactments are repeated all three days and end at nightfall on the third day. The most important involve mock battles among different ‚Äúbattalions‚Äù of ‚Äúsoldiers‚Äù which is loosely based on the historic Battle of Puebla which occurred on May 5, 1862. These occur at various times of the day and continue until those that represent the French Imperial Army loses. The battles can result in enough gun smoke from the powder used in participants‚Äô muskets to cover the town. When not fighting the soldiers either parade, often to the music of live bands. Parades of the battalions start by circling the main square twice, with each battalion followed by a live band. Traditional tunes include La marcha de Zacatecas, Juana Gallo and ¬°Que chula es Puebla! played as the soldiers dance and constantly set off their muskets. The second reenactment is a legend similar to a Romeo and Juliet story which comes from the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century. The main protagonists are a bandit by the name of Agust√≠n Lorenzo and the Corregidor's Daughter. Lorenzo was a bandit who operated in what are now the states of Michoac√°n, State of Mexico, Guerrero, Morelos and Puebla. He fell madly in love with the corregidor's (a public official) daughter but was forbidden to marry her because of social class. However, the daughter was attracted to him and agreed to run away with him. For this event, about 2,000 people participate, many of them soldiers from the Battle of Puebla reenactment. The young people who play the couple are chosen each year. This action takes place in front of the municipal palace, which stands in as the corregidor's home. One of the generals plays the role of the corregidor. The daughter receives three messages from the bandit. The bandit enters the scene to music, fireworks and musket fire. The daughter is waits for him on the balcony, already dressed in white. The bandit then climbs up to the balcony, subdues the soldiers guarding her and takes her down to his horse. Just before doing so, however, he tosses large amounts of play money to the crowds yelling ‚ÄúViva la plata‚Äù (Long live money (lit. silver)). The couple escapes on his horse as one group of soldiers pursue and the rest of the soldiers fire at the pursuers. At three pm, a priest marries Lorenzo and the daughter. However, the story does not have a happy ending. At four pm is the ‚Äúquema del jacal‚Äù (burning of the shack). This is the burning of a small shack made of palm fronds at one end of the plaza. It represents the house of the bandit with the couple inside. The legend has been interpreted as the hopes for equality among Mexico's social classes after its Independence as the daughter is of the elite and the bandit is poor. The shack is also interpreted as the various wars of Mexico from the ‚Äúflower wars‚Äù of the Mesoamerican era up through much of the 19th century. Simultaneous to the enactment of the Corregidor's Daughter story on the other side of the plaza is another reenactment. Huejotzingo was named one of the four regions to receive evangelizing first, with legend stating that the first weddings and baptisms in the Catholic rite in Mexico occurred here. Both the first wedding and the first baptism of the indigenous are reenacted. The battalions Indio Serrano Zacapoaxtlas Turko Zuavo Each year there are about 12,000 costumed participants. Most of these belong to one of the seventeen battalions which represent of all of the municipality's major communities as well as the original four neighborhoods of the town of Huejotzingo. These battalions have between 100 and 800 people, who carry hand carved muskets and leather masks. Each battalion has its own live band and several general. In 2013, the first women generals were elevated with Rosa Mar√≠a Castillo for the Zacapoaxtlas, Adriana Arroyo for the Zapadores, Mar√≠a de los Angeles Mendez and Maria Lomeli for the Indios and Fatima Bernaba for the Turcos. The muskets are for mock battles and other celebrating. They are used to set off real gunpowder but no bullets. Black gunpowder is used which is the most powerful and easy to ignite. The masks are handmade and include a beard. It is said that the hair for the beards used to be real human hair, often donated by female family members. All soldier participants spend the four days in mock battles representing the Mexican side or the invading French army. When not fighting, they visit graves of former battalion members in the morning, hold a mass parade at midday and petition homes and businesses for their main meal in the mid afternoon. This last tradition harkens back to the payment of tribute in the pre Hispanic era. Costumes of the soldiers vary, valuing anywhere from 7,000 to over 30,000 pesos depending on the materials and complexity. The seventeen battalions are further divided into five types of soldier- participants, based on costume style. These are called Zacapoaxtlas, Indios, Zapadores, Zuavos and Turks. The French imperial army consists of the Zuavos, Turcos and Zapadores. The Mexican army is mostly represented by the Indios Serranos and the Zacapoaxtlas. The Zacapoaxtlas stand out because they have the most elaborate and costly costumes. They dress as charros, which suits heavily decorated in sequins, a wig with the colors of the Mexican flag and a black cape. Representing the troops of General Zaragoza in the Battle of Puebla, they wear green, white and red paper streamers that hang off the back of their hats. Their suits are elaborated embroidered and sequined which has been hand done. These outfits have been valued at about 30,000 and sometimes as high as 50,000 pesos. The other main group is called ‚ÄúIndios Serranos‚Äù (Mountain Indians) or ‚ÄúInditos‚Äù (Little Indians). They represent Huejotzingo's indigenous past but their costumes are a fusion of both indigenous and European influences. Their hats are traditionally made from palm fronds (although many now are made with a kind of plastic strip) which have the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, the patroness of Mexico. They also carry an animal skin, preferably that of a cacomixtle in honor of the indigenous goddess Camaxtli, who was the patron of the region. Unlike the other groups, their masks are colored with an ochre tint. The ‚ÄúFranceses‚Äù (French) or ‚ÄúZuavos‚Äù represent a group of elite French troops at the Battle of Puebla, noted for their cruelty. They wear a blue cap decorated with stones, gold ribbons, sequined belts, leather masks, dark glasses and royal blue capes. They carry wooden boxes on their backs underneath which are the flags of France and Mexico. In the box there are soldiers‚Äô provisions such as French bread, although many today put commercial sandwich bread in its place. The ‚ÄúZapadores‚Äù are those who represent those of the elite classes in Mexican society. They are dressed as the imperial guard of Maximilian I and some as the personal guard of Mexico's first emperor Agust√≠n de Iturbide. Their outfits mix the national colors of both Mexico and France. They wear Spanish colonial style helmets made of black leather with the crest of Agust√≠n de Iturbide, in remembrance of Mexico's independence. For similar reasons, they also wear ribbons of green, white and red of Mexico's current flag. These are the soldiers who protect the corregidor's daughter during the reenactment of her abduction. The ‚ÄúTurcos‚Äù (Turks) are in reference to the Muslims against which the evangelists preached heavily in the early colonial period, although the Muslims in Spain were Moors rather than Turks. They are still considered an ‚Äúenemy‚Äù to Mexico in popular imagination and are in this carnival. They are also considered to represent mercenaries from Egypt brought by Napoleon III . They are dressed with turbans or tall hats, silk clothing, and scimitars and with crescent moons and peacock feathers used as decorative elements. They also have silk capes embroidered with images of Mexican heroes. The Turkish battalions mostly consist of people who live in the four original neighborhoods of Huejotzingo. Other participants Members of an Apache group In addition to the major soldier types there are other kinds of participants in carnival festivities. Negritos (Little Blacks) have only a red bandana and their faces painted black to distinguish them. They represent Mexicans of African descent which were brought to Mexico. Those who participate in the mock battles participate on the French side. The ‚ÄúApaches‚Äù wear costumes reminiscent of those of Aztec warriors and represent the origins of carnival in Huejotzingo. They fight on the Mexican side. Another small group is the ‚ÄúDiablos‚Äù (Devils). They represent a community which is since disappeared, where it is said that the residents practiced witchcraft. History The carnival began in 1868 only a few years after the Battle of Puebla in 1862. It is the oldest running carnival in the country. The festival was made famous by painters Diego Rivera, Desiderio Hern√°ndez Xochitiotzin and Fernando Ram√≠rez Osorio who painted scenes from it. The carnival's heavy use of volatile gunpowder has led to injuries and even deaths among participants and spectators, with the 2013 version using over five ton of gunpowder. In 2013, over one hundred were injured, about sixty five seriously, mostly burns from gunpowder. Despite the record number of injuries, organizers say it is not possible to ban alcohol or gunpowder as they are considered to be essential to the event.

Vesuvius in Giovanni Pacini's opera L'ultimo giorno di Pompei, 1827 La Scala production Sanquirico's design for the crowning of Ferdinand I of Austria at the Duomo, Milan Alessandro Sanquirico (27 July 1777, in Milan ‚Äì 12 March 1849, in Milan) was an Italian scenic designer, architect, and painter. He began his career in conjunction with leading artists of the time such as Paolo Landriani, Giovanni Pedroni, Giovanni Perego, and Georgio Fuentes.Sheren in Grove 1998, pp. 168‚Äì169. Additionally, he studied architecture and perspective with Giuseppe Piermarini, the architect of the La Scala opera house. Altogether, he designed over 300 productions for that house, including many premi√®res. Specifically, they included four operas by Vincenzo Bellini. Works Alessando Sanquirico (Litho Roberto Focosi, 1822) For fifteen years, from 1818 to 1832, Sanquirico dominated the visual style of La Scala, not only on stage, but also in the auditorium. He designed the ballets of Salvatore Vigan√≤ at the beginning of the 19th century, and the world premi√®res of Rossini‚Äôs La gazza ladra, Bellini‚Äôs Il pirata, La straniera, La sonnambula as well as Norma in 1831. His set designs were prepared for Donizetti‚Äôs works at La Scala, and these included Anna Bolena when it appeared there, Ugo, conte di Parigi and L'elisir d'amore, both in 1832, and the premiere of Lucrezia Borgia in 1833. He provided the decorations for the celebration of the crowning of Ferdinand I of Austria, as king of Lombardy and the Veneto. Additionally he worked in the Teatro Alberti in Desenzano, the Teatro Sociale in Canzo, the Teatro Sociale in Como, and the Teatro Municipale in Piacenza. He worked with Andrea Appiani and Bargigli in the design of the Arena Civica of Milan and provided the scenography for ballets by Salvatore Vigan√≤. He helped decorate ceilings in the Cathedral of Milan. Assessment In describing the scale of Sanquirico's work, Daniel Snowman discusses some its features in relation to the growing Romantic style of Italian opera from the 1820s forward: :Stage designs took on new life as imaginative artists such as Sanquirico in Milan and Pierre-Luc- Charles Ciceri in Paris strove to re-create visually the spirit and scale of the Romantic dramas their designs would showcase. Sets would typically reveal a rich embellished foreground featuring evocative architecture of an earlier age, opening out onto a distant landscape bordered by a moving diorama instead of a static backcloth.Snowman 2009, pp. 111‚Äì112. Paul Sheren further adds that the formula noted by Snowman \\"satisfied the aesthetic needs of romantic audiences for spectacle\\". Sheren concludes by noting that \\"one reason for Saquirico's international influence was the portfolios of hand-coloured engravings based on his theatrical and architectural drawings were published and extensively circulated and copied.\\" An example of one of the Raccolta di varie decorazioni volumes is included in the \\"Sources\\" below. They were published by Ricordi in Milan from 1818 onward. Another noted aspect of his work was that stage lighting, initially oil and Argand lamps, worked well with \\"his balance of contrasts and colours\\", but they helped create the \\"moods suggested in the librettos of many operas [including] overwhelming panic at the impending destruction of Pompei in Pacini's L'ultimo giorno di Pompei for Naples in 1825\\" and for La Scala in 1826.Baker 2013, p. 171‚Äì172. Additionally, in regard to lighting, by the end of his career (he retired in 1832), Sanquirico adapted to the introduction of gas lighting with the result that \\"his painted scenery showed a sensitivity to the nuances of light\\". On a broader scale on the advancement of operatic styles, Baker suggests that the spectacular set for L'ultimo giorno \\"played a significant role in the establishment of grand opera in Paris.\\" References Notes Cited sources *Baker, Evan (2013), \\"Alessandro Sanquirico\\" in From the Score to the Stage: An Illustrated History of Continental opera Production and Staging.

Honneur et Fid√©lit√©' regimental colors in 1918 Honneur et Fid√©lit√© (\\"Honour and Fidelity\\") is the motto of the French Foreign Legion. It has been inscribed on Legion flags instead of the Honneur et Patrie (Honour and Fatherland) inscribed on flags of the regular French Army of the French Republic. Nevertheless, both mottos share a similar past.  History  This motto of Honneur et Fid√©lit√© was the one written on the banners of Swiss Military units, notably the Swiss Line Infantry Regiments of the Kingdom of France during the Ancien Regime. Originally formed as the R√©giment de Salis () (Swiss regiment at the service of France; 12 companies of 170 men) in 1690, R√©giment de Diesbach (), becoming then the 85th Line Infantry Regiment () of the French Army in 1791. The 3rd Foreign Regiment ( before the creation of the Foreign Legion), throughout all the campaign battles of the Empire, would remain loyal to the motto of Swiss troops Honneur et Fid√©lit√© which would become that adopted by the French Foreign Legion. Regimental colors of the R√©giment de Salis (1782) Fidelidati & Honore inscribed on the regimental color of the R√©giment de Diesbach.  French Foreign Legion (1831‚Äìpresent)= Honneur et Fid√©lit√© & Legio Patria Nostra = Generally, mottos and creeds are chosen by a social organisation, a country, a dynasty to dictate a line of action or ideal.Legio Patria Nostra. Official Website of General Command of Foreign Legion, (C.O.M.L.E), Editorial of C.O.M.L.E in K√©pi Blanc. Retrieved October 6, 2015. The French military mottos are old: the Musketeers had their own \\"one for all, all for one\\" (), most of the foreign regiments in service of France during the Ancien R√©gime had chosen Nec pluribus impar, today the motto of the 1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment. These mottos were suppressed during the Revolution, when foreign regiments were dissolved and transformed to demi- brigades. First Consul Bonaparte chose for the Grande Arm√©e the motto Valeur et Discipline (\\"Valour and Discipline\\"), which remained almost until August 1914, when General Joseph Gallieni had the inscription Honneur et Patrie (\\"Honour and Fatherland\\") written on all emblems; the motto was already featured on the verso of the regimental colours of the first flag of the Foreign Legion from 1831 to 1835, and from 1840 to 1844 following the cession of the Foreign Legion in Spain. In 1920, Honneur et Fid√©lit√© was inscribed on Legion regiments: this motto of the Swiss Regiment of Diesbach under the Ancien R√©gime was chosen to emphasise on one hand on the perennity of foreign soldiers at the service of France, and on the other the integrity of their service to their institution while serving a country that is not theirs. As a result, and mainly for those two reasons, Lieutenant-Colonel Paul-Fr√©d√©ric Rollet, following World War I, vested his power to inscribe Honneur et Fid√©lit√© on the 3 Foreign Legion regimental flags. His vocation was received and approved by the minister, and the decree of 1920 precised that \\"Regimental Colours of the Foreign Legion, in existence or created in the future, will carry the motto Honneur et Fid√©lit√©\\". = Alsace-Lorraine = The mottos Honneur et Fid√©lit√© (\\"Honour and Fidelity\\") and Legio Patria Nostra (The Legion is our Fatherland) are the crucible identity of the Foreign Legion. It is not known exactly when and how was born and adopted the motto Legio Patria Nostra. It is possible that it could be approached to the concept of the Legion as a \\"go to place\\" which surfaced following 1871, when the Legion welcomed a great deal of those from Alsace and Lorraine, whom became stateless due to the annexation of their regions by Germany. On this subject, Ren√© Doumic, perpetual secretary of the French academy, cited in 1926 by General Rollet in the preface of the book of Jean Martin L√©gionnaire, stated: It is thus strongly probable that the question of the Alsace-Lorraine was the origin of this motto, as well as the mass income of foreign volunteers during the World War I.In fact, on 29 July 1914, intellectual foreigners launched a support calling to their adopting fatherland : Blaise Cendrars was one of these intellectuals who went to serve in the Foreign Legion. This calling grabbed success: \\"it is reported that 5 days following this calling, in one day only on August 3, 8000 foreigners volunteered at the recruiting doors!\\". = Adjudant-Chef Mader = Verso Colours of the 1st Foreign Regiment, 1e R.E with \\"Honneur et Fid√©lit√©\\". Sometimes, it is also tendered that the motto of Legio Patria Nostra (The Legion is our Fatherland) was originally warranted to Sous-Lieutenant Max-Emmanuel Mader, known as Adjudant-chef Mader. Originally German, disappointed by his army, he volunteered in the Foreign Legion in 1908 and fought in Morocco; he was awarded the rank of commander of the Legion of Honour, the M√©daille militaire, and was Mentioned in dispatches 9 times during World War I, including 3 times at the level of the entire military forces, before he lost his left arm in July 1918 and was discharged. Returning to Strasbourg as guardian of the Rhin Palace, he witnessed the period of the reoccupation of Alsace-Lorraine while pretending to be a deaf-mute. Mader was the symbol of legionnaires whose fidelity would carry his attachment to his fatherland. The belonging to the fatherland \\"Legio\\", does not oblige in any case the repudiation of the original country which the legion respects: the legionnaire is perfectly free of will to keep his nationality, and the legion requests the consent of every legionnaire before sending them to fight in their country of origin. Today, the legionnaire remains a \\"volunteer serving France with Honneur et Fid√©lit√©\\" and the Legion is their fatherland. General Aimable P√©lissier, superior commandant of the Province of Oran reminds in June 1854 at the 1st Foreign Regiment which was making way to the Crimean War after having constructed Sidi Bel Abb√®s: \\"Remember, while following the road of honour, that there is no more beautiful title in the world than that of French soldier, and that these noble fanions floating at the tip of your bayonettes are unfortunately your fatherland.\\"  See also  *Foreign Legion Pioneers (Pionniers) *History of the French Navy *French Navy *Troupes de la marine *Foreign Legion Recruiting Group *Swiss Guard *Malgr√©-nous *Honneur, patrie, valeur, discipline *Meine Ehre hei√üt Treue *Semper Fidelis References Military mottos French Foreign Legion French words and phrases ","title":"Honneur et Fid√©lit√©"},{"id":"38551007","text":"The Bangalore Astronomical Society (BAS) is a society of amateur astronomers and other interested individuals, headquartered in Bangalore.

He was a member of the prominent political family, Al-Azm. Early career Abdullah Pasha served under his father Muhammad Pasha al-Azm, who was governor of Damascus Eyalet (1771, 1773‚Äì1783), as the governor of Tripoli Eyalet and as amir al-hajj, the commander of the army tasked with supplying food to the pilgrim caravan returning to Syria from the Hajj (annual pilgrimage to Mecca). Abdullah Pasha was appointed to the governorship of Aleppo Eyalet in 1794.Douwes, 2000, p. 94. Governor of Damascus After serving one year as Aleppo's wali (provincial governor), Abdullah Pasha was transferred to Damascus Eyalet in 1795.Douwes, 2000, p. 93. He replaced his longtime rival, Jazzar Pasha who ruled Damascus from his stronghold in Acre, then capital of Sidon Eyalet.Phillip, p. 66. Abdullah Pasha's appointment was well received by the population of Damascus, who had prospered under the relatively long and peaceful rule of his father, as well as the other previous members of his al- Azm family, like As'ad Pasha and Sulayman Pasha, who also served terms as governors. Abdullah Pasha immediately had As'ad Effendi al-Mahasini, the Mufti of Damascus and ally of Jazzar, replaced with Abd al-Rahman Effendi al-Muradi. Abdullah Pasha's first term ended in 1798 after a revolt by Ibrahim Pasha al- Halabi of Aleppo. Jazzar soon became the unofficial power in the city when his troops entered the city later that year.Douwes, 2000, p. 95.Phillip, 2001, p. 71. When he was reappointed governor by Grand Vizier Yusuf Ziya Pasha in 1799, seven months after his dismissal, Abdullah Pasha had several of his opponents executed by hanging at the start of his second term.Phillip, p. 57. One of those executed was Abu Hamza, a close ally of Abdullah Pasha's rival, Jazzar Pasha, who ran affairs in Damascus proper along with Muhammad Aqil on behalf of Jazzar, who continued to reside in Acre.Phillip, 2001, p. 73. Following the occupation of Mecca by the Wahhabi-Saudi alliance in 1803, Jazzar once again replaced Abdullah Pasha as governor. Abdullah Pasha had led the annual Hajj caravan to the Islamic holy city, but received what was considered a humiliating reception by the Wahhabi occupiers. He was dismissed while besieging Tripoli to arrest an ally of Jazzar, Mustafa Agha Barbar. Meanwhile, another ally of Jazzar and the mutasallim (tax collector/enforcer) of Homs, Abdullah Agha al-Mahmud, laid siege to the Azm stronghold of Hama. Abdullah Pasha resisted his dismissal, abruptly withdrawing from the siege to relieve Hama. On the way to the city, his troops plundered some of the hinterland villages of the Talkalakh and Akkar areas. During the battle for Hama, Abdullah Pasha's forces decisively defeated Jazzar's allies, killing Abdullah Agha. Many of the latter's fleeing troops were attacked by Bedouin tribes. Although Hama suffered heavy civilian casualties, Jazzar's allies suffered a severe blow.Douwes, pp. 98-99. In Damascus, the mufti al-Muradi, previously appointed by Abdullah Pasha, was imprisoned by Muhammad Aqil and died in his cell. Aqil was later brought to Acre and executed on Jazzar's orders to placate the outrage of the Ottoman imperial government. From Hama, Abdullah Pasha led his troops towards Damascus and upon his army's arrival, the residents of the outskirts withdrew into the inner city out of fear. He was unable to capture the city, however, as a result of a mutiny. Abdullah Pasha apparently failed to pay his troops, who were in any case hesitant to confront the imperial garrison of Damascus.Douwes, pp. 95-96. After Jazzar's death in 1804, Abdullah Pasha was reassigned as governor for a third term. Jazzar's death was celebrated by the inhabitants of Damascus, who resented his brutal reign.Douwes, 2000, pp. 99-100. Abdullah Pasha was removed from office for the final time in 1807, the de facto Wahhabi rulers of Mecca refused to allow the caravan to perform the pilgrimage upon their arrival to the city, despite the fulfillment of the customary payment to Mecca's inhabitants, both the wealthy and impoverished.Douwes, 2000, p. 105. Abdullah Pasha had refused to adhere to the Wahhabis' demand that the security of the caravan enter the Islamic edifices unarmed and without the mahmal, a ceremonial decorated camel-borne litter. It was the first time the Hajj caravan of Syria was unable to proceed with their pilgrimage since 1757. Abdullah Pasha was replaced by his senior aide Kunj Yusuf Pasha.Douwes, 2000, p. 100. According to Dick Douwes, an expert in Ottoman history, Abdullah Pasha's rule as governor \\"failed to fulfill [the] high expectations\\" of the Damascene population who had fared well under Abdullah Pasha's father Muhammad Pasha, and Abdullah Pasha was not remembered \\"as a just ruler, but as a rapacious one.\\" However, most of the violent actions of his rule were attributed to high-ranking officials of his government, especially Darwish Agha. Abdullah Pasha was the last member of the al-Azm family to govern Damascus.Douwes, 2000, p. 57. Later assignments and death Following his return to Syria and dismissal from office in Damascus, Abdullah Pasha was assigned to brief terms as wali of Adana Eyalet and then to Urfa Eyalet until the early 1810s. According to Douwes, he retired to his residence in Hama after serving in Urfa,Douwes, 2000, p. 119. but Linda Schatkowski Schilcher writes that he died in Hama in 1809.Schilcher, 1985, p. 32. Abdullah Pasha left five sons and four daughters.Schilcher, 1985, p. 142. One of his sons, Hafiz Bey, served as a mutasallim of Damascus when the Egyptian forces of Muhammad Ali conquered the Levant. Hafiz was accommodating to the new Egyptian rulers.Misaqa, 1988, p. 214. Abdullah Pasha's eldest son Muhammad Yadu strengthened the al-Azm family's wide array of assets when he married his paternal cousin Asiya al-Azm. Another of his sons was Ahmad Bey, who owned property at Khitab.Douwes 2000, p. 73. Fatima al-Azm was Abdullah Pasha's only daughter to get married, wedding a distant relative, Akif, the son of the Egypt-based Khadija al-Azm.

Personal life and education Alexander was born in Trinidad and moved to the United States when he was eight. He grew up in the Bronx, New York City and attended De Witt Clinton high school. Alexander completed his bachelors of science from Haverford College in 1993, Sc. M physics in 1995, Sc. M electrical engineering in 1996 and a doctorate in 2000 from Brown University. Alexander is a scientist and a jazz saxophonist who deeply ponders on links, including sound, between small and big things in the universe that go beyond Einstein's curved space-time and big bang theory. Einstein's field equation being his favorite equation, his latest publication, \\"The Jazz of Physics\\", is an autobiographical reflection of his research and theories. Involved with cosmology as a professional physicist, he is also a jazz saxophone performer and a student of the works of John Coltrane, among other musicians interested in cosmology. At DeWitt Clinton High School in 10th grade, Alexander's real- life hero was his physics teacher Daniel Kaplan, who was the reason behind diverting Alexander's mind towards physics when discussing velocity and friction. In 2006, Dr. Alexander was named as one of the eight National Geographic inquisitive experimenters and explorers.  Career  After receiving his doctoral degree, Alexander was a research physicist at Imperial College, London, as well as at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, Stanford University. Alexander has held faculty positions at Penn State, Haverford College, and Dartmouth College before joining the faculty at Brown University. Alexander co-authored a paper in 2012 that reinterpreted Horava- Lifshitz theory. The paper, \\"Ho≈ôava-Lifshitz theory as a fermionic aether in Ashtekar gravity\\", studied how the HL theory could be naturally occurring. It also theorized that HL gravity could be interpreted as a time-like current that fills space-time.Stephon Alexander; Joao Magueijo; Antonino Marciano (June 2012). \\"Ho≈ôava-Lifshitz theory as a Fermionic Aether in Ashtekar gravity\\". INSPIRE-HEP =Academic life= Alexander started his academic career as a postdoctoral researcher at Imperial College, London, (2000-2002) and later on went to be a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University's SLAC and Institute for Theoretical Physics (2002-2005). In 2005, he became an assistant professor of physics at Penn State University. In 2008, he served at Haverford College as an associate professor of physics leading to his present positions of Ernest Everett 1907 Associate Professor of Natural Sciences and associate professor of physics and astronomy at Dartmouth College. Alexander also works as a professor at Brown University and has spent much of his career as a first generation advocate. He also advocates for historically under- represented groups in the sciences. He is a member of the editorial board of Universe. = Research = In December 2012, Alexander was the co-author of the paper, \\"Gravitational origin of the weak interaction's chirality\\". Focusing on the Lorentz group, the research studied the unification of the electroweak and gravitational interactions and the space-time connection. The paper theorized, in ways similar to Plebanski and Ashtekar, how those weak interactions on the right-handed chiral half in space-time connection could explain the weak interaction. The theory devised by Alexander and his co- authors was broken down into two phases. The first is a parity symmetric phase, similar to the studies and workings of Speziale. The next phase depends on whether the parity is broken or not. Under the breaking, it shows a Dirac fermion expressing itself as a chiral neutrino.Stephon Alexander; Antonino Marciano; Lee Smolin (December 2012). \\"Gravitational origin of the weak interaction's chirality\\". INSPIRE-HEP. Around the same time, Alexander co- authored another paper that focused on the study of electric time in quantum cosmology. The paper formulated and studied new possibilities of the quantum behavior of space-time.Stephon Alexander; Martin Bojowald; Antonino Marciano; David Simpson (December 2012). \\"Electric Time in Quantum Cosmology\\". INSPIRE- HEP. Alexander has mainly worked to extend Einstein's theory of curved space- time, taking it to extremes in the connection between the smallest and largest entities in the universe. Being a string cosmology expert, he co-invented the model of inflation called D-Branes. This was based on higher dimensional hypersurfaces in string theory. Alexander has worked as the director of Dartmouth College's EE Just STEM Scholars Program, volunteered for public speaking in inner city schools, taught mathematics in prisons and monitors activities relevant to his scholarship. = Media = In February 2013, Alexander wrote in the NY Times, speaking about the need for black academics to set a positive trend for the next generation. In the article, he called upon a number of personal experiences from his own education and life.\\"Black Academics Have a Responsibility to the Next Generation\\". NY Times. February 4, 2013. Alexander has been interviewed or quoted in media sources like the Tavis Smiley Show, Forbes Magazine, NPR, Brian Lehrer Show, Science Salon/Skeptic Society, Downbeat Magazine, and Mercury News. = Music = As a jazz saxophonist, Alexander has been trained by Ornette Coleman and Will Calhoun. His album with Rioux, Here Comes Now, was critically acclaimed. Alexander and bassist Melvin Gibbs formed a group that they named God Particle. Alexander is also the author of The Jazz of Physics, a book that discusses the link between music and the structure of the universe. On a Nova documentary, Alexander was featured discussing his life as a jazz saxophonist, while also working as a physicist during the day.Marykwas, Donna (November 19, 2010). \\"PBS NOVA's secret life of scientist Stephon Alexander: sax-playing physicist\\".

The N-terminal half of the protein catalyzes the conversion of farnesyl diphosphate to germacradienol and germacrene D, followed by the C-terminal- mediated conversion of germacradienol to geosmin. The conversion of FPP to geosmin was previously thought to involve multiple enzymes in a biosynthetic pathway.  Species distribution  Geosmin is found in a wide variety of microbes such as cyanobacteria and actinobacteria. Geosmin has also been found in myxobacteria, fungi, arthropods, and plants such as beets. Based on studies performed on a geosmin synthase (encoded by SCO6073) in Streptomyces coelicor and the high sequence similarity between this and other known or putative geosmin synthases (45-78% identity), it has been hypothesized that all geosmin synthases function in the same manner. Screening of available bacterial genomic data has resulted in the prediction of at least 55 putative geosmin synthases in this domain of prokaryotic organisms.  Function and mechanism  Prediction of C-terminal domain of Geosmin synthase using I-TASSER Prediction of N-terminal domain of Geosmin synthase using I-TASSER = Two distinct active sites = Geosmin synthase is approximately 726 amino acids in length and has two distinctive active sites on the N-terminal and C-terminal halves, respectively (in S. coelicor the N-terminal domain consists of amino acids 1-319 while the C-terminal domain exists from 374-726), both of which resembling the sesquiterpene synthase pentalenene synthase. Both the N- and C-terminal halves of the synthase contain aspartate-rich domains (DDHFLE and DDYYP, respectively) and the NSE amino acid motif (NDLFSYQRE and NDVFSYQKE, respectively), which bind trinuclear magnesium. Magnesium is a necessary cofactor, without which the synthase displays a complete lack of catalytic activity. In experiments where FPP was incubated with recombinant geosmin synthase, increasing the concentration of the synthase or increasing the incubation time resulted in an absolute and relative increase of geosmin compared to the intermediate germacradienol; this shows that geosmin synthase does not act exclusively on a series of enzyme-bound intermediates. Instead, germacradienol is released from the N-terminal domain and then rebinds to the C-terminal domain for final conversion to geosmin. Targeted mutagenesis of the N-terminal magnesium binding sites resulted in an enzyme incapable of converting FPP to germacradienol and germacrene D. Targeted mutagenesis of the C-terminal magnesium-binding sites resulted in an enzyme incapable of catalyzing the second half of the reaction from germacradienol to geosmin, but still capable of converting FPP to germacradienol and germacrene D. Truncated mutants of only the N-terminal or C-terminal halves of the geosmin synthase are also capable of catalyzing their respective reactions, providing further evidence that the N- and C-terminal halves of geosmin synthase are in essence two distinct and independent enzymes. = N terminal repeat = The N-terminal half of geosmin synthase contains a second NSE magnesium-binding motif, approximately 38 residues downstream of the first. Targeted mutagenesis of this repeated NSE motif does not significantly alter the catalytic activity of the synthase, suggesting that it does not serve any functional role. This repeated downstream motif is well-conserved in other known or putative geosmin synthases, suggesting that it either has a role that has not yet been discovered or may be a remnant of evolutionary development. = Proposed mechanism = The first step in the mechanism is for FPP's carbon-carbon double bond farthest from the diphosphate group to attack the carbon adjacent to the diphosphate, forming a cyclic carbocation with the loss of the diphosphate group. A 1,3 hydride shift moves the carbocation closer to the nearest carbon-carbon double bond; the loss of a proton forms a new carbon- carbon double bond and allows the carbon-carbon double bond adjacent to the carbocation to quench this charged group, forming the byproduct germacrene D. Alternatively, the carbocation produced in the first step can immediately lose a proton to form the intermediate isolepidozene, which is subsequently attacked by water to form germacradienol. Further processing of germacradienol involves a proton-initiated cyclization and a novel retro-Prins-type fragmentation producing the intermediate octalin and byproduct acetone. Finally, protonation, a 1,2 hydride shift, and quenching by water convert octalin to geosmin.  Industrial importance  Geosmin has a very low detection threshold in humans of ~10-100 parts per trillion. Geosmin produced by various microbes can contaminate water supplies, degrading consumer confidence and decreasing water utility performance. One action taken to treat geosmin contaminated water supplies is the addition of copper sulfate, which is controversial due to possible environmental effects. Studies attempting to link the expression of geosmin synthase to various environmental conditions (e.g., light and temperature) have shown synthase production to be correlated with cell growth but not significantly affected by diurnal cycles. Geosmin production is also correlated to the availability of substrate, as demonstrated by the deletion of pathways competing for precursors to FPP, which led to an increase in geosmin production. The growing body of knowledge on geosmin synthase and its conserved and functionally important components have led to the development of a DNA PCR screen that may allow for better detection of geosmin synthase containing microorganisms, potentially allowing for better control of geosmin production and contamination in water supplies.

Murder On March 27, 2004, Thomas stabbed to death his 20-year-old estranged wife, their four-year-old son, and her 13-month-old daughter in his wife's home.

He stabbed himself in the chest but did not die, so he placed the organs in his pockets and walked to his house, later moving the hearts and piece of lung to a paper bag and throwing them in the garbage. He called his wife's parents and left a voicemail: > Um, Sherry, this is Andre. I need y'alls help, something bad is happening to > me and it keeps happening and I don't know what's going on.

Self-injurious behavior Five days after the murders, he removed one of his eyes with his bare hands. He was evaluated by three specialists, all of whom concurred that he suffered from some form of schizophrenia.

He is credited with creating the first electric bread toaster, which then went on to be developed by Crompton, Stephen J. Cook & Company as the Eclipse. Although not ultimately a commercial success, MacMasters's invention would pave the way for Charles Strite to invent the automatic pop-up toaster in 1919, which is the device we know as the toaster today. MacMasters died of heart failure on 25 December 1927 at the age of 62. In November 2018, the Bank of England shortlisted Alan MacMasters out of 227,299 nominations to appear on the new ¬£50 note, in recognition of his contribution to engineering and science in the United Kingdom. Inventing the Toaster (1883‚Äì1893) In the Autumn of 1883, Alan MacMasters began his study at the University of Edinburgh within the Department of Natural Philosophy (today the faculties of Physics, Science and Engineering). He spent much of his time studying under Professor Fleeming Jenkin, through whom he connected with the ongoing Glasgow Underground project. MacMasters would go on to research and develop an innovative new lighting system to brighten the dimly lit carriages. While MacMasters's high luminosity underground lighting would form the backbone of his initial success as an industrialist, it also inadvertently led to his better known discovery, the toaster. Although intended for Glasgow, MacMasters's lighting system would first be implemented on the City & South London Railway. It was while working in London that MacMasters met electrical engineer Evelyn Crompton. One night after working together to deliver an electrical and lighting system for what would later become the London Underground Northern line, Crompton invited MacMasters for a drink. Legend has it that after a half-bottle of whisky, MacMasters admitted to Crompton his sly attempt at cost cutting by sourcing a cheaper metal for his filaments. The attempt was a complete failure, as the supplier had put a large amount of nickel in the wire. The resultant lamp ran so hot that his nearby bread began to brown. MacMasters joked that he ought to put one in his kitchen. An amused Crompton invited MacMasters to join him at his laboratory at No. 48 Kensington Court. It was there that MacMasters spent the next several months perfecting the world's first electric bread toaster before selling the design on to Crompton. MacMasters's toaster was brought to mass market as the 'Eclipse'. It had four electric elements built on a ceramic base. Electricity could be sourced via an adapter that plugged in between a lamp and socket. Unfortunately, by 1894, the MacMasters Eclipse toaster had become the cause of one of Britain's first deadly appliance fire. A woman in Guildford was overcome in her kitchen after the early elements melted and ignited the table. MacMasters and Crompton denied wrongdoing and instead blamed the deceased for 'not holding appropriate respect for the power of the electric toaster' in reference to the fact it had been left unattended. The invention of the electric kettle is also attributed to MacMasters, who sold the design to Crompton alongside the toaster in the early 1890s. While it used largely the same technology, the element was held in a separate chamber.

Views Kettani has been described as an ideological leader of the Salafia Jihadia movement, though he and other detainees rejected this and saw themselves as normal Sunni Muslims with a Salafist orientation.Alison Pargeter, The Islamist Movement in Morocco. The Jamestown Foundation, May 23, 2005. Since his pardon he has openly criticized what he defines as Wahhabism, comments which have caused rifts among Moroccan Salafists. He has often spoken against what he sees as depraved Western influence in Moroccan society, and his views prior to his incarceration had been regarded as extreme by many in the security establishment. Since his release, Kettani and several other former detainees have been noted as denouncing extremism and violence. Kettani, along with other Moroccan conservatives, distanced themselves from the Moroccan branch of Ansar al- Sharia, refusing to lend support to the budding group.Mawassi Lahcen, Ansar al-Sharia emerges in Morocco by Magharebia. October 19, 2012. Kettani's family being rooted in Morocco's traditional religious scholarship, he is an expert in both the Zahirite and Malikite schools of Islamic law, though his conservative views have been described as being at odds with the latter.

Weber was a whistleblower who reported allegations about foreign espionage against the stock exchanges, and misconduct in the Bernard L. Madoff and R. Allen Stanford Ponzi scheme investigations. He was terminated months later for supposedly unrelated reasons. He sued the SEC, claiming wrongful termination and retaliation against him for coming forward as a whistleblower. In June 2013, the SEC settled with Weber his whistleblower protection and U.S. District Court lawsuits by reinstating him and paying him $580,000, one of the largest federal whistleblower settlements in US history. In 2014, author and blogger Larry Doyle named Weber as one of his \\"top 5 whistleblowers\\". On July 30, 2015, Weber was recognized by six United States Senators and one member of the House of Representatives at the First Congressional Celebration of National Whistleblower Appreciation Day. Weber is now in private practice of law and an assistant professor at a Maryland state university. Education Weber graduated from Utica College of Syracuse University (Criminal Justice; cum laude, 1995), and Syracuse University College of Law (J.D., magna cum laude, 1998). He was admitted to the New York State bar in 1999, the District of Columbia Bar in 2000, the Maryland Bar in 2013, and the Virginia Bar in 2017. He is a licensed private investigator, with firearms authority, in the Commonwealth of Virginia, certified by the Virgnia Department of Criminal Justice Services. Career=Early career= After graduation from law school, Weber became a law clerk to New York United States District Judge Neal P. McCurn working on criminal and civil cases. When his judge sat by designation on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Weber assisted with criminal and civil appeals in 1998 and 1999. Subsequently, Weber was Special Counsel for Enforcement for more than ten years at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, at the United States Department of the Treasury. He followed that up by practicing as Supervisory Counsel and Chief of Enforcement Unit I for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), responsible for overseeing all banking enforcement activities and investigations involving state chartered banks and bank failures for the western half of the United States. Weber served as the FDIC's signatory on the $1 billion settlement eliminating the refund anticipation loans product from the nation's banking system. =Securities and Exchange Commission= In January 2012, Weber was promoted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Assistant Inspector General for Investigations at the Office of Inspector General, directing all criminal, civil and administrative investigations into fraud, waste and abuse in SEC programs and operations, and supervising the Office's investigative staff. In this role, he served as the SEC's chief investigator for internal affairs. At the end of that same month, H. David Kotz, SEC Inspector General during the previous four years, resigned and returned to the private sector as managing director of Gryphon Strategies. His resignation came in the midst of questions as to his conduct, as then- current and former SEC employees had complained that Kotz initiated investigations without credible evidence and unnecessarily tainted people's reputations. Madoff accusations, cyber compromise, and retaliatory paid leave In March 2012, Weber alleged improper conduct by Kotz, asserting that Kotz may have had personal relationships that tainted SEC investigations of the Bernard Madoff and R. Allen Stanford Ponzi schemes. Kotz said Weber's accusations were \\"completely and utterly ludicrous and untrue.\\" Despite Kotz's protestations, further investigation proved the allegations were indeed true. Weber also reported potential \\"national security\\" concerns and \\"possible espionage\\" by \\"foreign nationals\\" related to a case Weber was investigating that \\"involved unencrypted computer hard drives that contained sensitive stock exchange information.\\" Nevertheless, in May 2012, Weber was placed on administrative paid leave after fellow staff complained that he purportedly spoke openly about wanting to carry a concealed gun at work, and brought a bullet-proof vest to work. He was also banned from entering SEC headquarters. Weber denied those allegations. U.S. Senator Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) sent a letter to SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro, asking for a copy of the \\"security threat evaluation\\" on the basis of which Weber was banned from the SEC's offices. The SEC refused to provide the supposed threat evaluation against Weber to Congress. Later, it was revealed that the supposed threat evaluation found that Weber was not a threat, and could return to work. The SEC, however, did not return him to work. Williams report Weber's allegations against Kotz led the SEC to bring in Inspector General David Williams of the U.S. Postal Service to conduct an independent, outside review. The 2012 Williams report concluded that Kotz had in fact violated ethics rules by overseeing investigations that involved people with whom Kotz had ‚Äúpersonal relationships.‚Äù In addition, the Williams report looked at separate allegations that Weber had created a hostile work environment at the SEC. It did not find any evidence that Weber's conduct was improper or triggered security concerns. The report made clear that the allegations of the bullet proof vest were false; the vest belonged to the SEC and was donned as ‚Äúa joke after Weber‚Äôs colleagues placed smiley-face stickers on it.‚Äù. SEC OIG staff also previously carried firearms; the USPS OIG report found that without law enforcement and weapons authority, the SEC OIG was unable to protect the rights of witnesses or complainants. The sole discussion of weapons at the SEC was in the context of re-certifying special agents to carry weapons after SEC OIG's certification had lapsed, prior to Weber being hired. The Williams report also documented that the SEC's own supposed threat evaluation of Weber was false, and cleared him to return to work (though it failed to do so). Finally, the Williams report found that Weber‚Äôs reports concerning deficient SEC computer security had merit. Whistleblower allegations Weber claimed the retaliation was intended to reprise against him for revealing misconduct within the SEC in the Madoff and Stanford investigations, perjury by Chairman Mary Schapiro in testimony before the United States Senate and House of Representatives, and to delay the filing of reports to Congress on the gross misconduct of William S. Fagan (Chief of Security Services for the SEC), Jeff Heslop (Chief Operating Officer of the SEC), and Weber's investigation into the SEC for exposing potential vulnerabilities of the NYSE and NASDAQ Stock Exchange. According to Weber, Heslop was the target of at least two OIG investigations, including whether Heslop had improperly steered work to Booz Allen Hamilton. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is probing the allegations. Chairman Darrell Issa noted that Thomson Reuters' report and investigation about the suspicious and wasteful hiring of the Booz Allen consultants were \\"broadly compatible\\" with the Weber lawsuit allegations. According to Weber, Fagan was engaged in pay to play schemes in hiring private security contractors, as well as substantial nepotism in the hiring of security staff. Weber also alleged that Fagan engaged in a cover up of multiple sexual assaults of guard staff and a female visitor to the SEC who was assaulted on a late night due to insufficient security at the SEC's Union Station headquarters. Fagan then used the same private security contractor hired under the pay to play scheme to supposedly investigate Weber, a direct conflict of interest. The US Postal Service OIG, in their 2012 report, found that Fagan's misconduct violated a number of laws and regulations, including the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Executive Department employees. A subsequent SEC OIG report also found that Fagan engaged in a coverup of sexual assaults and failures to properly screen employees and contractors of the SEC for criminal convictions. The investigation into the SEC computer security lapses was detailed in an August 30 report by Interim Inspector General Jon Rymer. His report stated that while there were 28 laptops in question, the outside firm conducted forensic testing only on \\"several select laptops\\" to determine if a breach occurred. In response, NYSE Euronext hired former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff to make sure sensitive exchange data were not breached after U.S. securities regulators left their computers unencrypted. ‚ÄúEverything was on those laptops,‚Äù said one exchange official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ‚ÄúYou could find the system architecture and technology maps of both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, information about their key data centers, their emergency plans. It‚Äôs virtually everything you need to know if you were a terrorist looking to sabotage the U.S. capital markets. An SEC spokesman confirmed that the security lapses did occur. Dismissal and lawsuit Weber worked at the SEC until October 31, 2012, when, months after becoming a whistleblower accusing the SEC of significant misconduct in the Madoff and Stanford investigations, cyber compromise of NASDAQ, as well as SEC's most senior management misconduct, he was fired for supposedly unrelated reasons. He sued the SEC in federal court in Washington, D.C., in November 2012, saying he was wrongfully terminated and retaliated against for trying to investigate misconduct at the SEC and for coming forward as a whistleblower. Less than two weeks after Weber's suits were filed, the Chairman of the SEC resigned, followed in short order by the resignations or firing of each senior management official of the SEC, including Heslop, Fagan, and the SEC's General Counsel, Mark Cahn. Kotz responded to the civil lawsuit saying that: \\"for some inexplicable reason, my name has been dragged through the mud in the most ludicrous and unbelievable allegations.\\" The SEC said it would \\"vigorously contest\\" the lawsuit. Yet, the allegations against Kotz were proven to be true, and the SEC did not contest the lawsuit, or even file an answer. Instead of vigorously contesting the lawsuit as promised, in June 2013, the SEC settled the lawsuits with Weber by paying him $580,000, reinstating him from the date of his dismissal, and clearing his personnel and security records. Weber purportedly received the third largest federal whistleblower payment in US history. Despite being reinstated, Weber decided not to return to his former position, instead to stay in private practice by \\"helping others through my growing law and forensic investigations practice.\\" In 2014, blogger Larry Doyle named Weber as one of his \\"top 5 whistleblowers\\". On July 30, 2015, Weber was recognized by six United States Senators and one member of the House of Representatives at the First Congressional Celebration of National Whistleblower Appreciation Day. =Post-SEC, Military Service, Law Practice, and University Teaching= As of July 2014, Weber and his wife Julie Goodwin Weber were principals in Goodwin Weber PLLC. In addition to practicing law, Weber is a certified fraud examiner, private investigator. He was a lecturer and the academic director of fraud management programs at Robert H. Smith School of Business, University of Maryland, College Park. At the university, Weber directed the American Bankers Association - Smith School Fraud and Anti- Money Laundering Management Program and taught in the school's executive MBA and online MBA programs. He also taught in the master's accounting program, the graduate certificate in risk, compliance and law, and undergraduate classes. In 2017, Weber taught a course on organized crime involvement in white collar crimes and collaborated with Bernard Madoff on Maryland fraud curriculum. In addition to teaching, Weber is a Woodrow Wilson Visiting Fellow of the Council of Independent Colleges. Until 2016, Weber was a Lieutenant Colonel and the appeals officer for the 70th Regiment of the Maryland Army National Guard,http://www.aba.com/Training/Schools/Pages/FMP-faculty.aspx and member of the Judge Advocate Corps of the Maryland State Guard. As a financial expert, Weber analyzed a number of loan agreements included among the Panama Papers. In Fall 2020, Weber assisted the Associated Press in their investigation into how the Venezuelan government avoided US and global sanctions through Asia. In May 2016, Weber was awarded the Distinguished Teaching Award by the Smith School, at the University of Maryland, for undergraduate teaching, and the teaching recognition award by University of Maryland Global Campus. In October 2015, the Syracuse University College of Law named Weber as one of five recipients of the first \\"Syracuse Law Alumni Honoree\\" award for \\"distinguished achievements.\\"https://news.syr.edu/2015/10/college-of-law-to-honor-five- distinguished-alumni-faculty-13295/ Weber is now an assistant professor of accounting at Perdue School of Business, Salisbury University.

It was produced in 1439 at the Council of Basle, published by an anonymous author, and referred to the injustice of the German rulers. The Reformatio was published in German and probably as a result became the most widely circulated reform paper of its time. The text was first printed in 1476 and there were seven new editions by 1522. In part it was even treated in the 15th century as an imperial law. The Reformatio stands at the beginning of a trend to no longer publish constitutional and political principles solely in Latin, but also in German. In terms of content the Reformatio differed little from other political reform texts of Sigismund's reign. It presented proposals for the reform of church and empire, some of which were practical, others were unrealistic. The text contained a teaching of the sacraments and argued in favour of the marriage of priests and the secularization of church property. In addition it included a vision of Emperor Sigismund's about the appearance of a priest-king Frederick and plans for a wide reform of the monarchy (and emperorship) and the (German) empire.
