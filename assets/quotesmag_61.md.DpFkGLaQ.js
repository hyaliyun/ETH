The CALERIE study is being carried out at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center (Baton Rouge, Louisiana), the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University (Boston, Massachusetts) and the Washington University School of Medicine (St. Louis, Missouri).About CALERIE , retrieved 12 October 2009. It is hoped that caloric restriction reduces the incidence of cardiovascular disease and cancer and leads to a longer life, as has been demonstrated previously in numerous animal studies. CALERIE is the first study to investigate prolonged calorie restriction in healthy humans. Study subjects are selected from people who are not obese (because calorie restriction on obese people is already known to lengthen life, but possibly for different reasons). A smaller predecessor study ended in 2006. Forty-eight subjects were randomly assigned to a control group and a treatment group; those in the treatment group were put on a 25% calorie reduction over a 6-month period. It was found that the treatment group had lower insulin resistance, lower levels of LDL cholesterol, lower body temperature and blood-insulin levels as well as less oxidative damage to their DNA.Eat less, live more, The Economist, April 22, 2006 The second, larger, phase of CALERIE began in 2007. The participants are subjected to a 25% calorie restriction over a 2-year period, and several physiological variables are regularly monitored. Participants are paid US$5,000 at Tufts and Pennington and $2,400 at Washington University. As of October 2009 the study had 132 participants and was still accepting new ones. Study subjects have to be highly motivated and organized enough to keep a detailed journal of all foods they eat. Their daily baseline calorie requirements are precisely determined before the trial: in a two-week laboratory test the rate of carbon dioxide production is measured, allowing to compute the number of burned calories. The subjects are then taught a diet of low-energy density foods, such as vegetables, fruits (especially apples), insoluble fiber and soups. Most subjects reported that they felt hungry for the first few weeks, after which they adjusted to the new diet. Complaints focused on the rigid bookkeeping scheme imposed on them. Results were posted to the Clinical Trial website in 2018 with a (paywalled) Lancet article published in 2019. MSN published article based on an interview with Dr Kraus. Background That calorie restriction (CR) might lengthen human lifespan was suggested by various studies on laboratory animals. However, when the studies were extended to long-lived primates (rhesus monkeys), while it was indeed found in a 2012 study by the US National Institute on Aging (NIA) that CR had benefits to immune function, motor coordination, and resistance to sarcopenia, a CR regimen implemented in rhesus monkeys of various ages did not improve survival outcomes. The authors considered that the study suggested \\"a separation between health effects, morbidity and mortality\\", and that \\"study design, husbandry and diet composition may strongly affect the life-prolonging effect of CR in a long-lived non-human primate\\".

Historical Atlas of Oklahoma (Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1986), plate 38. During the early 1980s, Jack‚Äôs Fork Creek was impounded by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, who built Sardis Lake. The lake, a flood control project, also held tourism potential and Oklahoma State Highway 43 was straightened and paved with blacktop from the interchange at Daisy on the Indian Nation Turnpike to the lake, where it crosses the dam and connects to Oklahoma State Highway 2. This allowed for easier road connections to other parts of the state highway network. At this writing tourism has not been promoted heavily or its economic benefits realized at the lake. In order to make way for the lake the community of Sardis was emptied. Its cemetery, now located on an island in the lake connected to the shore by a short causeway, is at the approximate location as it was originally, but the tombstones now sit on landfill and are many feet higher than originally. The graves they denote are below the bottom of the lake. The earliest gravestones are dated 1875, a testament to the community‚Äôs early establishment.Pushmataha County Cemeteries, pp. 156-159.

Founded in 1944 as a private high school by a group of Mennonite churches, governance, at a board level, is provided by representatives of 14 Society churches. History of MEI Beginnings In May 1944, representatives of fourteen Mennonite churches in British Columbia were invited to a meeting to discuss starting a Mennonite high school. Support for this concept grew very slowly. Only seven churches were represented at the first meeting, and one of these was strongly opposed to the idea. However, at a second meeting on June 5, 1944, representatives from nine churches voiced their support; this group of supporters became the MEI Society churches. At this meeting, Mr. C. Toews, Mr. G. Sukkau and Mr. A. Bauman were elected to go to Victoria to present the plan to the provincial government. The committee met with Dr. Samuel John Willis, British Columbia's long-serving Deputy Minister of Education, who pointed out the advantages of integration into the public Canadian school system for students of Mennonite origin. Eventually, however, he stated that the government had no objection to the establishment of an independent school, if three conditions were met: there would be no financial support from the government, qualified teachers must be hired, and the English language must be used. In addition, Grade 12 students would be required to write departmental examinations. However, further obstacles surfaced. Due to wartime restrictions, no building permits could be obtained to erect a new building. On July 3, 1944, representatives from ten churches met to discuss this. It was decided to enlarge South Abbotsford Bible School, allowing Grades 9 and 10 to be offered in the fall. Mr. Isaak J. Dyck of Winkler, Manitoba was hired to teach at a salary of $1,500 per year. Mr. F.C. Thiessen taught as well, and served as principal for the first year. A 26'x46' addition was hurriedly built onto the Bible School at a cost of $1,500. Churches which had pledged support were levied a $1 per member fee, thereby raising $2,300 to cover the costs of building and outfitting the school with desks, blackboards, and basic library and lab equipment. Student tuitions were set at $80. Interest in MEI that first year exceeded expectations, with sixty students wishing to enroll. Since some Grade 11 students also wished to attend, a third teacher, Mr. H. Nikkel, was hired. However, the war intruded again, and several of the young men who had begun attending received their conscription notices and were forced to leave. In order to help the fledgling school get on its feet, all three teachers accepted salaries at 50-70% of those paid in the local school district. The 44 remaining students generated only $3,520 of the $4,200 required for their salaries that year. Despite such a meager beginning, the project continued to move forward. It was assumed right from the beginning that the Bible school annex was a temporary solution, and discussions about whether the school should be located in Abbotsford or Yarrow continued. Eventually, were purchased at the corner of Clearbrook and Old Yale Roads, and blueprints were drawn for a six-room school. New MEI Campus It was decided that for 1946-47, South Abbotsford Bible School would move to property which had been purchased north of Clearbrook, on the present Columbia Bible College site, allowing the high school to expand into the entire Bible School building until the new facility was ready for occupancy. The building period appears to have been very difficult. Some materials, such as kiln-dried lumber, could not be obtained due to war shortages, volunteer labour (which was needed to keep the costs down) was not always readily available, and money from churches to support the project was slow coming in. Several large bank loans were necessary and anxiety about the school's future ran high. However, despite setbacks and difficulties, the building was occupied in December 1946, and grew steadily over most of the next 34 years, both in physical size and in student enrollment. Setbacks During the late 1960s, student enrollment dropped, largely because of reorganization in the public system which moved Grade 7 to the elementary level and Grade 13 to the college level. The Mennonite community also shifted towards greater support of public education. MEI's building was old and in need of repair, and the facilities it offered did not meet rising standards. Career-oriented course offerings in the surrounding public school district had expanded, but financial restrictions kept MEI's course offerings narrowly academic. Turmoil in the youth culture prevailed across the continent. All these reasons sparked serious debate about whether MEI should continue or whether the public system would better meet the needs of modern students. Move to current site In April 1973 several concerned businessmen in the community formed a new society called \\"Friend of the MEI\\", with the goal of providing financial assistance to the school in order to expand its program offerings and to renovate or relocate the school building. For the first several years of operation, the \\"Friend\\" contributed exclusively to the school's operational budget. But discussions about moving the school to a new campus burgeoned, and in 1976, the Society resolved to begin actively searching for a possible new site. It was the vision and drive of the Friend of the MEI that provided the impetus for relocation to the present site at the corner of Clearbrook and Downes Road; the school moved in 1980. In keeping with the \\"tradition\\" of continual expansion, the new school building has already seen two additions: one at the east end in 1988, and another at the west end in 1992. These additions give the secondary school a total floor area of over . Elementary school MEI expanded its program offerings beyond the secondary grades for the first time in 1993, with the introduction of Kindergarten and Grade 1. A complete elementary school opened its doors in 1997 on the Abbotsford campus, the site of a former soccer field for the secondary school, and offered Kindergarten to Grade 7. By 2003, this school had 608 students enrolled. Chilliwack MEI Chilliwack, established in July, 2001, helped the Society address one of their goals for the next ten years ‚Äî to build a satellite campus in that area. The Chilliwack campus was founded in 1990 and operated under the authority of Valley Christian School. In 2001, the Parent Society of financially troubled VCS released the school so that it could become part of the MEI Society. MEI Chilliwack offered Kindergarten to Grade 9; students of high school age who wished to continue their education at MEI were compelled to travel to the main campus in Abbotsford. On July 1, 2010, the Chilliwack school became independent once again, under the name of Cascade Christian School. Middle school In 2003, construction began on a middle school on Downes Road, next to the secondary school building. In the fall of 2004, the doors to this latest addition were opened, reducing the number of students in the elementary school to 450 by limiting it to Grades K - 5. The new middle school had 370 students enrolled, with space available for approximately another 100 students. This addition also meant that the portable classrooms could finally be removed. With the Grade 8 classes moved into the middle school, the secondary school's enrollment has been lowered to a more manageable 635 students. Independent school status and governance MEI is classified as a Group 1 school under British Columbia's Independent School Act, and as such receives only 50% of the Abbotsford School District‚Äôs per student operating grant from the Ministry of Education. The school receives no government funding for capital costs. Governance is provided by a board of directors, consisting of 6 executive and 15 non-executive members elected by members of MEI's 12 supporting churches. Academics MEI has maintained a tradition of academic excellence throughout its 60-year history, consistently ranking 78 of 529 secondary schools in BC for student performance on provincial exams. Students in Grades 4, 7 and 10 met public and private school average results in standardized Math & Academics Reading test and in 2012, MEI graduating students were recognized as a finalist in the Fraser Institute's recognition of Academic Excellence in the province. The school's stated commitment is \\"the assurance that all MEI graduates are qualified for admission into universities, colleges, technical, and Bible schools.\\" Over 50% of MEI's students complete their year on the school's Honour Roll, which requires an average of 80% and higher, and more than 2/3 of graduates move on to post-secondary institutions. The Fraser Institute's 2014 report card on school performance gave the secondary school 8.1 out of 10 and ranked it 30th out of 289 schools. When its elementary school is compared to other local public elementary schools it ranks 3 out of 8 when students with learning disabilities are factored out. Athletics After adding basketball to its academic offerings in 1946, the school has attained excellence in a number of sports, hanging BC Provincial Championship Banners on the gym wall in basketball in 1963 and volleyball in 2013. Individual MEI athletes have, in the past, also won gold at the high school swimming, golf and track and field championships.

He is buried in Highland Cemetery in Wichita, Kansas. The Dawes Commission was appointed by the U.S. Government to prepare the Choctaw Nation and its sister Five Civilized Tribes for statehood.George H. Shirk, Oklahoma Place Names, p. 197; National Governors Association, http://www.nga.org/portal/site/nga/menuitem.29fab9fb4add37305ddcbeeb501010a0/?vgnextoid=c74d224971c81010VgnVCM1000001a01010aRCRD. During the 1880s the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway, more popularly known as the ‚ÄúFrisco‚Äù, built a line from north to south through the Choctaw Nation, connecting Fort Smith, Arkansas with Paris, Texas. The railroad paralleled the Kiamichi River throughout much of its route in present-day Pushmataha County, Oklahoma. Train stations were established every few miles to aid in opening up the land and, more particularly, to serve as the locations of section houses. Supervisors for their respective miles of track lived in the section houses to administer the track and its right-of-way. These stations also served as points at which the trains could draw water. The site of Stanley was selected because of its proximity to the Kiamichi River, with its abundant water supply. Adjacent station stops were established to the north and south. The sparsely populated area, at that time known as Jack‚Äôs Fork County, a part of the Pushmataha District of the Choctaw Nation, in the Indian Territory,Morris, John W. Historical Atlas of Oklahoma (Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1986), plate 38. was home to Choctaw Indians who farmed or subsisted on the land. Few roads or trails existed. Transportation was provided by the Frisco Railroad, which offered six trains per day‚Äîthree in each direction‚Äîuntil it closed to passenger traffic during the late 1950s. It continued freight operations until 1981, when it closed altogether and its rails were removed. The loss of passenger rail coincided with the construction of Oklahoma State Highway 2. Stanley is located in one of the most scenic places in Oklahoma. It is surrounded by the Kiamichi Mountains to its east and west, with summits to Stanley‚Äôs immediate west reaching 1,600 feet in elevation. The summits to Stanley‚Äôs east are lower. The relatively flat valley floor stretches to Stanley‚Äôs northeast and southwest.Google Maps.

Nice, 241 U.S. 591 (1916), is a United States Supreme Court decision which declared that Congress still retains plenary power to protect Native American interests when Native Americans are granted citizenship. United States v. Nice overruled the Heff decision which declared that Native Americans granted citizenship by the Dawes Act were also then citizens of the state in which they resided, meaning the sale of alcohol to such Native Americans was not subject to Congress‚Äôs authority.Smith, Michael. ‚ÄúThe History of Indian Citizenship.‚Äù Great Plains Journal. 10.1 (Fall 1970): 33‚Äì35. Print. Facts The first page of the Dawes Act In 1897, an amendment to the Indian Appropriations Act banned the sale of alcohol to Indians. Citizenship of the parties involved was never clarified. In the Supreme Court case Matter of Heff, the decision clarified that a Native American granted citizenship through the Dawes Act is immediately a citizen of the U.S. and his state. The 1897 amendment banning alcohol was considered a police statute, where power lies with the state and not Congress, and therefore would not apply to such a citizen. Representative of South Dakota, Charles H. Burke, saw the need to correct the situation in order to protect Native Americans from the sale of liquor. He amended the Dawes Act so that citizenship was only granted to a Native with an allotment after the trust period ran out (usually 25 years Canby Jr., William. American Indian Law In a Nut Shell, 4th edition. West Group, 2004. (21) Print.). This amendment was meant to allow Congress to continue to safeguard Indians‚Äô personal welfare. However, those who received allotments before the amendment was signed into law on May 8, 1906 were still considered state citizens and not subject to federal authority except when concerning their land. The amendment only put the alcohol ban into effect for Natives receiving allotments after May 8, 1906. When Fred Nice was indicted for selling alcohol to a Native American who received an allotment before 1906, he was acquitted in a lower court using the Heff decision as his defense, but the U.S. appealed, represented by Assistant Attorney General Warren. Warren argued that the Pelican Case, proved federal authority and overruled the Heff decision. Holding The court held that congress would retain plenary power to protect Native Americans. Such plenary power is based on \\"the clause in the Constitution expressly investing Congress with authority 'to regulate commerce . . . with the Indian tribes,'\\" and the perceived dependence of tribes on the United States. This decision meant the federal government could regulate Indian alcohol policy through the commerce clause and state powers could regulate Indian alcohol policy through the power of the police to regulate the conduct of citizens. The major ruling is summed up by the following quote: ‚ÄúCitizenship is not incompatible with tribal existence or continued guardianship, and so may be conferred without completely emancipating the Indians, or placing them beyond the reach of congressional regulations adopted for their protection.‚Äù. The decision was based on a complete review of the Dawes Act which found that congress must have wanted to continue the ward- guardian relationship because it retained control over Indian money to look over ‚Äúeducation and civilization.‚Äù The ruling in United States v. Nice overruled the Heff decision, claiming it was \\"Not well grounded.\\" The decision also references United States v. Holliday to show Congress's ability to regulate commerce. Another reference is made to United States v. Kagama to show the dependence of tribes on the United States. A similar situation in the case United States v. Sandoval is referenced to show that citizenship of the Indian party is not relevant to the issue of Congress's authority. Implications Woodrow Wilson addressed Native Americans on their progress towards civilization in 1913. The legal position of Native Americans during the time of the case could be compared to that of a Minor. Minors are citizens with guardians and have special laws applying only to them. Native Americans were set to have congress as a guardian. This status stemmed from the view of Native Americans as an inferior race which was put into legal terms in the case Johnson v. M'Intosh.Duthu, Bruce. American Indians and the Law. New York: Penguin Books, 2008. (73) Print. Native Americans were viewed as unable to resist or handle alcohol.Miller, Robert J. \\"The 'Drunken Indian': Myth Distilled into Reality Through Federal Indian Alcohol Policy.\\" Arizona State Law Journal. 28.223 (Spring 1996) Congress viewed United States citizenship as a method of civilizing Native Americans.Wilkins, David E.

Nice implies the inferiority of Indians and allows for individual liberties of Native Americans to be restricted based on such an implication.Wilkins, David E. American Indian Sovereignty and the U.S. Supreme Court: The Masking of Justice. University of Texas Press, 1997. (136) Print. Effects United States v. Nice was referenced in the case United States v. Mazurie to support the court's decision to uphold a conviction of selling alcohol in Indian Country against non-Indians on the Wind River Reservation who had been denied a tribal liquor license.. United States v. Nice upheld Congressional power to regulate any commercial transaction involving individual Indians or a tribe,Ott, Brian R. \\"Indian Fishing Rights in the Pacific Northwest: The Need for Federal Intervention.\\" Boston College Environmental Affairs Law Review. 14.313 (Winter 1987) wherever situated, and to regulate the introduction of alcoholic beverages into Indian country. In his book American Indian Sovereignty and the U.S. Supreme Court: The Masking of Justice, David E. Wilkins claims that the decision in United States v. Nice \\"Muffled rights of individual Indians as federal citizens.\\" The court's decision continued the contradictory treatment of Native Americans with the incongruous ideas of Indians as dependent people in need of protection and Indians as United States Citizens.Wilkins, David E. American Indian Sovereignty and the U.S. Supreme Court: The Masking of Justice. University of Texas Press, 1997. (118) Print. United States v. Nice upheld the plenary power of Congress. The nearly unlimited power of Congress to adjust Indian rights still exists today. However, in the late 1960s and 1970s, congressional leadership began to see Indian policy in a new light. The past half century has seen a surge of laws favorable to Indians which allow tribes much more influence over their own futures.Wilkinson, Charles. Blood Struggle: The Rise of Modern Indian Nations. New York: Norton & Company, 2005. (242) Print.

The high school itself was founded in 1924 when the government school was split into a high school and a junior school. Estcourt High School, being a country school, pioneered agriculture as a school subject and also gave instruction in both English and Afrikaans. History Estcourt High School was founded in 1924 from the upper forms of the Estcourt Government School when it was split into two.Pearse, RO - Sable and Murray - The story of Estcourt High School, The Natal Witness, Pietermaritzburg, 1946  Estcourt Government School  After a number of attempts to establish private schools had failed due to lack of support, the town's first government school, the Estcourt Government School was established in 1886 with an initial role of 45 children. In accordance with the prevailing colonial policy, the school only admitted pupils of European descent. At the start of the twentieth of the century, the Estcourt Government School had about 100 children and only offered formal education at primary level, even though the occasional bright student was coached at secondary level to enable them to enter university. In 1915 lessons in Dutch was offered for the first time and 75 children out of 115 took up the subject. Although there were a few children who spoke Dutch or Afrikaans as their mother tongue, instruction in that language has to wait until 1945. By 1924 the school had expanded to 226 children when the new headmaster, Major AC Martin MC arrived. Martin had been awarded the Military Cross during the First World War. That year four children sat the matriculation exam. This sparked a growth in demand for secondary education and in 1927 the school was split into two - Estcourt Junior School retaining the old school building and the high school moving to a new 10 ha site. AC Martin's headmastership Martin planned the new school as a co-educational school catering for both boarding and day pupils and by the end of his headmastership for both English and Afrikaans speaking pupils. During the first year of the school's existence on Hospital Hill, a hostel with 50 places was completed with a second hostel following in 1936. He was instrumental in the school having a coat of arms designed by the College of Heralds. The school site was split into two by the Loskop road. Martin laid out the school's academic and hostel accommodation to the north of the road and the sports fields, consisting of two full sized cricket pitches, two rugby pitches and three hockey pitches to the south of the road. He persuaded the Estcourt Town Council to donate a further 8 ha of land to the school enabling it to offer the study of agriculture to its pupils. A swimming pool was opened in 1931 - the first for any state school in the province. In 1934 Martin initiated the building of a separate science block, but it was not completed until 1941, by which time Martin had left the school. The block was named Martin Block in his honour. R O Pearse's headmastership The Second World War broke out in 1939 and in 1940 Martin, was recalled to his regiment, the Durban Light Infantry. Martin, along with many school old boys and parents of pupils was later to be taken as a PoW at Tobruk. Three months after Martin left the school, Reg Pearse took up the headmastership of the school. Once the war had finished, Pearse set about expanding the school. Almost immediately he set about overcome administrative obstacles and developing strong ties with both the farming and town communities to negotiating funds for the Memorial Hall which was eventually opened in 1957. The increasing role of the school and the demand for places in the hostel lead to the building of a third hostel which was opened in 1955. By the time Pearse retired in 1965, 250 pupils out of a total of nearly 600 were boarders. Sporting facilities were enlarged with the swimming pool being enlarged a few years later bringing it to its current \\"L\\" shape. The school's sports teams played against other schools across the entire province. Due to government-imposed restrictions under the Apartheid regime, the school was only permitted to field teams against other schools reserved for whites. As a result, the teams often had to travel 100 km for away matches. At Natal Schools sport tournaments, the school usually competed under the colours of North Natal Schools which fielded teams made up of players from all the North Natal secondary schools. In cultural events however such as debating and chess, the school's opponents were usually the private schools in the Natal Midlands or the state schools in Pietermaritzburg. Subsequent headmasterships Pearse retired at the end of 1965 and Mitchell Lindsay, the former deputy head who had joined the school in 1937 was appointed headmaster. Lindsay's wife, whom he married in 1943 was the former Jean Leiper, also a maths teacher who served the school from 1937 until 1970. In his first annual report given in November 1966, Lindsay announced that work done by himself and by Pearse had resulted in a grant of R235,000 (¬£117,500) being made available for a major expansion program which included science laboratories, art rooms, domestic science rooms, an enlarged staff room, changing rooms for day boys and girls and a separate library. The additions were completed in early 1969 and eased the pressures on the school as the school's role rose from 480 in 1966 to 570 in 1968. Until the end of the 1960s the school had been an academic high school; technical and commercial subjects being offered at other schools in the province, but none of which were in Estcourt itself. In December 1969 Linday announced the conversion of the school from an academic school to a comprehensive school with academic, technical and commercial subjects being offered alongside each other in Std VII from 1971 progressing to the matric exams of December 1974. The change in the school's emphasis would result in a much larger school as local pupils who were previously educated outside the town could be educated in the town. The school coat of arms In 1927 Col Martin decided that the school should have a coat of arms that was designed by the College of Heralds. This was unprecedented in South Africa and necessitated correspondence with, amongst others, the provincial administrator, the interior minister, and the prime minister. The arms were eventually granted just before the school's golden jubilee in 1936. The symbolism on the shield is: * The open book of learning ‚Äì the heraldic symbol of an academic institute * The green vertical triangles (or piles) that allude to the highest peaks of the Drakensberg - Champagne Castle, Giant's Castle and Mont-Aux-Sources, all of which are visible from the school. * Two wavy white lines that allude to the Tugela and Orange rivers, both of which rise in Mont- aux-Source * Blue dots that allude to the tears of Weenen - the scene of a Voortrekker massacre in 1838. The crest depicts the hill on which the school was built and has decorations alluding to aloe and acacia, plants that are typical of the area. On the hill the English lion holding a flag showing a sheaf of wheat - the symbol of agriculture, a subject pioneered by the school. The school motto Celer et Audax was also the motto of Martin's old regiment. The Memorial Hall At the end of the Second World War, the South African Government made funds available for the building of school halls on the basis that it would match whatever funds the school was able to raise. In August 1945, at a meeting attended by parent and the local public, it was decided that the proposed school assembly hall would be a living memorial to the old boys who died on active service during the two world wars. and approached the Estcourt Town Council for donations. The town council obliged, but in 1948 the National Party came to power and refused to fulfill the promises made by the previous administration and the hall was not completed until 1957. In the event, when the railway line that ran alongside the school was doubled, the main road from Estcourt to Loskop was realigned to other side of the railway line and the school was able to acquire the land that was formerly occupied by the old Loskop Road. The Memorial Hall was built on the site this road.

It is a combination of autobiography, medical history, and social activism that discusses the author's experience with diagnosed anxiety, treatment thereof, the history of mental health treatment in general, and a veteran patient's possible objections to the nature of mental health treatment today. Background In 2001, while working as a columnist for Canada's The National Post newspaper, Pearson was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and prescribed the anxiolytic Effexor. Pearson claims that she became addicted to this substance until missing even one dose caused her to feel \\"like [she] was trapped in a disco club on acid with the strobe light at maximum pulse\\".Pearson, Patricia, A Brief History of Anxiety (Yours & Mine), Random House (2008), p.141 In a National Post column written around that time, Pearson described running out of medication at night when the pharmacy was closed and lifting up the refrigerator to see if she had dropped a tablet under there. Her psychiatrist was reportedly unsympathetic, and Pearson began to question the conventional wisdom about mental health treatment that is common among non-patients. Further setbacks in her personal life and career led her to do extensive research on mental health treatment not only today but over the past few centuries. The result was her book, published by Random House in 2008. Synopsis The book consists of nine chapters and a section of endnotes. All of the chapters combine narrative, personal reflection, historiography, and social commentary. Pearson's style is evident in the beginning to the eighth chapter, \\"2001: A Drugs Odyssey\\": In this book, Pearson frequently challenges generally accepted layman views about mental health and mental health treatment. \\"The idea that people need antidepressants because they have a 'chemical imbalance' in their brains,\\" she says at one point, \\"has evolved into a sort of urban legend\\".Pearson, p.149 She states that \\"[t]he trouble with this soothing explanation...is that serotonin deficiency is an unsupportable claim\\".Pearson, p.150 Pearson also challenges conventional medical wisdom: at one point, she states that, although some psychoactive medications target dopamine in the brain, over 85 percent of the body's dopamine is found outside the brain, and the medications' effect on those other tissues is almost completely unresearched.Pearson, p.85 The Notes section contains 172 references ranging from scholarly articles to the poetry of William James and the philosophical writings of S√∏ren Kierkegaard. Reviews The Toronto Star review writes that Pearson's psychiatrist \\"chose the pills carefully; she was prescribed the ones he happened to have samples of in his office\\". It rates the book as \\"excellent\\". A review on the webzine More.ca, describes the book as \\"Part memoir, part cautionary tale, and part an investigation into the history and geography of anxiety\\" and states that it is \\"soothing\\". A review in Metapsychology Online Reviews writes that the book is \\"a vibrant and interesting introduction to the problem of anxiety\\" and states that \\"[Pearson's] struggle with pharmacological treatments makes for sober reading\\".

The field was also the home field of the short-lived New York Brickley Giants, of the early National Football League, who played two games there during their 1921 season. In 1926, the Brooklyn Horsemen of the first American Football League used the stadium as their home field. The lot was acquired by the New York Parks Department in 1940, and the field survives today as a multi-sport facility called Hamilton-Metz Field named after US Representative Herman A. Metz and US Founding Father Alexander Hamilton. In 1929, a visiting Bermudan cricket team played several matches at Commercial Field, defeating the All-New York and All-Brooklyn teams. The Bermudans returned for more tours during the 1930s. In 2006, a $1.57 million restoration was completed, with the field relaid in artificial turf.

The Curved saber of San Mart√≠n is an historic weapon used by Jos√© de San Mart√≠n. History The Curved saber of San Mart√≠n was acquired during his stay in London, shortly after he left Spain and before embarking for South America. Later, San Martin would arm his granaderos cavalry with similar weapons, which he deemed ideal for cavalry charges. Following the withdrawal of San Mart√≠n to Europe, after the Guayaquil conference, the weapon remained in the city of Mendoza in the hands of a family friend. In a subsequent letter his son-in-law, Mariano Balcarce, was asked to send him the sword in Europe, and it remained in his possession until his death on August 17, 1850. Before dying, San Mart√≠n bequeathed his sword to Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas. Mariano Balcarce wrote the following to give the news. Rosas in turn bequeathed the sword to his friend Juan Nepomuceno Terrero, and after his death to his wife and then their sons and daughter in order of age. The sword thus passed into the possession of Maximo Terrero and Manuela Rosas after the death of Rosas, with Juan Terrero having died earlier. In 1896 Adolfo Carranza, director of the National Historical Museum, requested of them the donation of the saber of San Mart√≠n, to which they acquiesced. It was sent back from London to Buenos Aires, arriving on 4 March 1897 to be kept in the National History Museum. Theft The sword remained there until 2 August 1963, when it was stolen by members of the Peronist Youth. It was recovered a few days later, and temporarily placed in the custody of the Mounted Grenadiers Regiment, until its return to the museum. The sword was stolen again on 19 August 1965 and again recovered a few days later. However, at that time the Regiment was granted definitive custody, being placed inside a screened gazebo which was built for the purpose and was a donation of the City of Buenos Aires. The curved saber has remained there since.

He is co-founder and current CEO of social networking website Tagged and was CEO of JumpStart Technologies, LLC.  Early and personal life  Tseng attended Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology and won numerous awards in mathematics and science. He placed 9th in the 1993 national MathCounts competition, tied for 1st place (with a perfect score) in the 1994 American High School Mathematics Exam, and qualified for the United States of America Mathematical Olympiad every year from 1994 to 1997. He was a Finalist in the 1997 Westinghouse Science Talent Search for a project titled \\"Development of a Fiber Optic Evanescent Wave Ion Sensor With Interchangeable Probes Adaptable for Field Application\\" and received official commendation from the Fairfax County School Board. For this project, Tseng was also featured in The American Physical Society's A Century of Physics Timeline and inducted into The National Gallery for America's Young Inventors which produced a comic strip biography of him. Tseng is an avid runner and has completed several road marathons and trail ultramarathons.  Scientist  From 1997 to 2004, Tseng was an active researcher in nanotechnology at The MITRE Corporation, Harvard University, and Stanford University. At MITRE, he co-authored a Science journal article entitled \\"Toward Nanocomputers\\". At Harvard, he earned an A.B. in Chemistry & Physics & Mathematics in 2001 and co-authored a Science perspective entitled \\"Carbon Nanotube-Based Nonvolatile Random Access Memory for Molecular Computing\\" which is the technology behind the company Nantero. At Stanford, he conducted research in the Goldhaber- Gordon group. He was pursuing a Ph.D. in Physics under a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship.  Entrepreneur  At Harvard, Tseng was Director of the Harvard Entrepreneurs Club (HEC) from 1998 to 2000, and co-wrote The Harvard Entrepreneurs Club Guide to Starting Your Own Business (Wiley, 1999). In the fall semester of 1999, Tseng and two classmates launched flyingchickens.com, a price comparison shopping engine for Harvard textbooks. In the spring semester of 2000, flyingchickens.com was merged with Limespot.com and the textbook shopping service was revamped and expanded to over 80 college campuses. In late 2000, Tseng and three other college entrepreneurs were interviewed and featured in The New York Times and Fast Company. While at Harvard, Tseng also co-founded Jumpstart Technologies with longtime friend and business partner Johann Schleier-Smith. Jumpstart was an incubator of Internet businesses including online matchmaker CrushLink and social networking site hi5. In October 2004, Tseng and Johann Schleier-Smith co-founded Tagged, and were both named by BusinessWeek as one of Tech's Best Young Entrepreneurs. They jointly received a U.S. Patent for their invention \\"User created tags for online social networking\\" which has led to over 200,000 user-created Tags on Tagged. , Tseng is CEO of Tagged and advises several other Silicon Valley startup companies. At first Tagged was a site meant for just teenagers but Tseng realized that he wanted to expand and help the business grow. He expanded his demographic to those who were 13 years old up in all countries. In 2007, he decided to change Tagged's business model and evolve into a social network site that allows you to meet new people and he called it 'social discovery'  Controversies  Two of Tseng's companies, Jumpstart and Tagged, have been criticized for their alleged misuse of commercial email and have been the subject of legal action. In 2006, Jumpstart Technologies settled with the Federal Trade Commission on alleged violations of the CAN-SPAM Act which included a $900,000 fine but no admission of guilt. The FTC alleged that \\"in its FreeFlixTix promotion, Jumpstart violated the law by disguising its commercial e-mails as personal messages, and by misleading consumers as to the terms and conditions of the promotion\\" and stated \\"Deceptive subject lines and headers not only violate the CAN-SPAM Act, but also consumer trust.\\" Between April and June 2009, Tagged sent tens of millions of spam emails that falsely stated that a contact sent photographs to the recipient. State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo announced his intention to sue Tagged for \\"deceptive email marketing and invasion of privacy\\". Tagged paid or agreed to pay separate settlements of $250,000, $500,000, and $650,000 relating to these practises. Additionally, in 2002, Salon.com published a negative review of Jumpstart's CrushLink website. CrushLink was alleged to harvest e-mail addresses for later use in spam e-mail in exchange for deceptively offering the name of a \\"crush\\" that in the vast majority of cases did not exist.

It is now a ghost town. A United States Post Office opened at Zoraya, Indian Territory on April 22, 1905, and closed on October 31, 1919. The post office was established by J.A. Kirksey, a white school teacher. He was succeeded as postmaster by only two others: Culberson J. Hudson, a Choctaw Indian minister, and rancher, Benjamin W. Shearon, who managed Warren‚Äôs Store, the general store at Miller serving the Impson Valley, as the area was then known.George H. Shirk, Oklahoma Place Names, p. 228. Originally a Choctaw Indian settlement, Zoraya was host to Pleasant Cove Cumberland Presbyterian Church, which had a Choctaw congregation. At Zoraya‚Äôs height approximately 19 families lived there, and their members are buried in the former church yard. The families lived along a lane, with houses lining either side. By the late 1930s the church was inactive but the settlement was still inhabited. By the 1950s the settlement was mostly empty. At this writing Zoraya is no longer a settlement, and no remains of its former habitations exists.Interview with Fred E. Reed, who lived in Zoraya for a time during the 1940s and 1950s. Zoraya, at the foot of Long Mountain, was considered a good place to live because of the excellent hunting nearby, plus its proximity to three well-watered local streams which offered excellent fishing: Little Davenport, Pine and Ten Mile Creeks. Blue Hole, a deep and never-dry pool of water on Little Davenport Creek, is located nearby and furnished an excellent source of water. It is long by wide and its water is a deep blue, giving the pool its name.‚ÄúBlue Hole‚Äù, Indian-Pioneer Papers, Western History Collections, University of Oklahoma Libraries; Google Maps. During the days of the Indian Territory the United States Government set aside of land for use by the church and a community school, which taught both white and Choctaw students. Accounts also suggest the Government recruited and furnished the teachers and their salaries. Circa 1900, Pleasant Cove merged with another Cumberland Presbyterian Church congregation about eight miles (13 km) away, at Yellow Spring, or ‚ÄúKulli Lakna‚Äù in the Choctaw language. The new congregation was based at Pleasant Cove, and reenergized and enlarged the church. According to historical accounts Pleasant Cove, or Zoraya, was an important regional political center in the Choctaw Nation. Political party conventions were held here, as were political campaigns. It also served as an Impson Valley polling station for the Choctaw Nation beginning with the Choctaw national election of August 1896. During territorial days Zoraya was located in Jack‚Äôs Fork County of the Choctaw Nation.‚ÄúPleasant Cove Indian Church‚Äù, Indian-Pioneer Papers, Western History Collections, University of Oklahoma Libraries; Act of the Choctaw Council dated Oct. 16, 1895, Choctaw Nation Papers, Box 27, Folder 6, Western History Collections, University of Oklahoma Libraries.

The game was released on May 1, 2009 for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. It became available on Steam on December 4, 2009.http://store.steampowered.com/app/41300/ It has become a free game in 2014, from the previous 9.99 price. Gameplay Players control one of five customizable aircraft and battle in teams across 2D landscapes. As a player gains experience in battle they unlock new planes and customizations called perks. The game has been described by the press as a cross between Teeworlds, Team Fortress 2 and a role-playing video game. Altitude is primarily an online game with some offline skirmish options and bot support. There are several modes, and plane customizations. Game modes Free For All (ffa)  The players compete in a timed deathmatch, competing for the highest number of kills. Team Deathmatch (tdm)  The players are divided into two teams, competing for the highest kill total in a specified amount of time. Team Base Destruction (tbd)  In Team Base Destruction or TBD, players try to use a special bomb to destroy the enemy's base while protecting their own bases from the bomb. Planes must pick up the bomb and \\"bomb run\\" it into enemy territory with or without escorts to score a hit on the enemy's base. The bomb runners are always at a disadvantage due to the fact that a plane carrying a bomb is slowed down which makes it more vulnerable to enemies. bombs spawn at either base and can only be used by that team and will be simply disarmed instead of picked up or spawn in the middle of the map where any team can use it. if the bomb hits something else other than a base it will most likely instakill it due to the fact that the bomb does extremely large amounts of damage. Ball Ball mode utilizes a single persistent ball and a goal for each team. Every time a goal is scored all planes are reset and the ball is given to the team that just conceded the goal. At the beginning of the match the ball is placed in the middle of the map. The winning team is the team that reaches 6 goals first, or once a timer expires. A plane that carries the ball is slowed down, much like in Team base destruction. One life deathmatch (1dm) This game mode is similar to normal deathmatch, with the exception that players will not respawn until the round is completed. Its objective is to be the last plane left alive. There is also a round time limit. One life demolition (1de)  The one life demolition game type sets up the teams in an attack/defense scenario, where one team has to plant a bomb on the defender team's base, and the defenders have to stop them. The teams switch places after a number of rounds, swapping the attackers and defenders. One life team base destruction (1bd)  The one life tbd mode is similar to the normal tbd type, but with one life per round. The one life game types are all round based.

Thirteen passengers were killed after derailed carriages collided with station buildings. Circumstances In Victorian times annual holidays to Scotland were popular amongst the affluent, inspired by Queen Victoria's visits to Balmoral Castle. The 'Tourist Special' which left London Euston at 20:00 on 2 August 1873 drawn by two locomotives consisted of 25 vehicles by the time it left Crewe including many private family coaches. Many of the passengers were aristocrats travelling north for the opening of the grouse season. As the long train ran through Wigan North Western station the driver glanced back and saw sparks flying to the rear of the train. After drawing to a stand he walked back to find an appalling sight at the south end of the down platform. The first 15 carriages of the fast- moving train had passed safely through the station, but two wheels of the 16th coach had derailed at a set of facing points. Next came a luggage van which had derailed completely, demolished a lineside shunter's cabin and lost its side in the process. The couplings held on both these two vehicles and they travelled the length of the platform and were rerailed by a crossing at the north end. However the following carriages had all derailed on the points and broken away from the train. They lay shattered at the start of the platform and on the passing loop behind it, leaving 13 dead and 30 injured. Only the last coach and rear brake-van were undamaged. The front portion of the train continued to Scotland 90 minutes later. Investigation The lengthy enquiry failed to find any fault with the offending points which indeed had suffered virtually no damage. However almost all the passengers stated that they had been alarmed by the speed of the train and the rocking of the carriages on the journey up from Euston. The conclusion of the enquiry was that the speed of the train had been excessive, especially considering its motley collection of carriages. However, an extra tie-bar was added to points so as to increase their strength and stability, a design modification which remains in current points on the national network.

He was born in 1944 in the small town of Tamluk (now in Purba Medinipur District), which was the ancient Indian port of Tamralipta in West Bengal. Chandan came to Kolkata after finishing his high-school studies at Tamluk Hamilton High School. After graduating from Asutosh College, he obtained his master of arts degree in political science from the University of Calcutta. He hoped to become an experimental scientist like Jagadish Chandra Bose, Newton or Edison. Although Chandan did not accomplish this, he expresses his love of experimentation in art and literature. In 1968 and for several years thereafter, he participated in poetry readings at the Saturday open-air MuktaMela fairs at the Kolkata Maidan grounds with other contemporary poets like Tushar Roy, Rabindra Bhattacharya, Bablu Roy Choudhury, Satya Ranjan Biswas, Pranab Basu Ray, Samar Bandyopadhyay and Abu Atahar; this taught him how to perform his poetry in later life. It was the launch-pad where he could mobilise his associates when, after editing a few hand-written magazines, he was trying to begin a new literary movement. At the MuktaMela he discovered Dilip Gupta, Ashis Deb and Shukla Mazumder, with whom he launched the Prakalpana Movement in Bengali literature with the countercultural magazine Swatotsar in 1969.  Prakalpana and Chetanavyas  Chandan coined the word prakalpana (meaning \\"proper imagination\\"), an amalgam of pra from prabandha (essay), ka from kabita (poetry), lpa from galpa (story) andna from natak (drama). Later, he expanded its origins more globally: P for prose, poetry and graphics; R for story; A for art, Chetanavyas and essay; K for kinema; L for novel, culture and play and N for song.Texture, Norman, Ok, USA. Although the word prakalpana is found in some Indian languages, Chandan used it as the name of a new form of composition and movement. That eventually led him to begin his ongoing magnum opus Atiprithibi 1. The first part of the Bengali version as well as the English version, Cosmosphere 1, have been published. Chandan authored the first prakalpana book, Porimandal, which was published on Prakalpana Day (6 September 1975). In the early 1970s he developed the philosophy underlying the Prakalpana Movement and its counterpart (the Sarbangin Poetry Movement), which he called Chetanavyas. According to Chandan, what is seen everywhere is change (in the outer world of matter and in the inner world of sense and consciousness). This is Chetanavyas, which is the conflux and interaction of chetana (sense) and abvyas (wont, or custom). \\"Sense\\" is assigned the widest conceivable meaning here, as the feature differentiating a living object with a lifeless one, and includes attributes of the conscious and subconscious mind. \\"Wont\\" (abvyas) is used here as the habit of living objects and the nature of non-living ones. As habit may be considered as \\"second nature\\", that second nature evolves over time; the smallest unit of a living organism works and perishes faster than that of a lifeless object like a granite stone. Thus the universe, which is perceivable only through the higher form of sense that is consciousness, is composed of sense-full and senseless matters acting, reacting and interacting internally and externally in accustomed ways during their respective spans of time. After this they degenerate, decompose and dwindle to dust or particles, to be regenerated and recomposed again in some form.Bangla Galpa-Kabita Andoloner Tin Dashak, Sandip Datta, Radical Impression, 1993. Apart from Chetanavyasism and Prakalpana, Chandan's other teachings (part of the Prakalpana Movement) include Sarbangin poetry, flow verse, visual effects, \\"golden language\\", \\"proverse\\", mathematical dimensions and sonorous, musical and repetition effects. Appraisals of his prakalpana include: > \\" The bizarre but compelling language is given an enhanced weirdness by the > slightly awkward obviousness of its trans from Bengali sometimes resulting > in an enjoyable ...effect.\\" NewHope International Review , Vol 18, number 5. > \\" I enjoyed the most....the experimental fiction piece Aurora On The River > Gour, which bordered on inaccessible at times but was interesting > nonetheless...\\" Sean Stewart in The New Pages Zine Rack, number 31.  Sarbangin poetry  Some critics label Chandan's writings as concrete or visual poetry, because he uses his drawings and symbols in his writings. Concerning this belief, Steve LeBlank (who interviewed Chandan in the early 1990s) commented: > ‚ÄúThe visual element is important but not crucial. Chandan, for example, has > developed his own key of signs and symbols which he routinely uses in > writing. Symbols which, he says, help distinguish Prakalpana from other > forms of writing‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Chandan takes care to distinguish his symbols, and the way > they are used from other types of writing and poetry which also rely on > symbols, including visual and concrete poetry.\\"Songs of Kobisena, Steve > LeBlanK, Version 90, Alston, MS, USA. Dilip Gupta, critiquing Chandan's Posha Paahkhi Hobona: I Won‚Äôt Be a Pet Bird, observed: > ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶he is the inventor and propagator of a separate, distinctive genre of > literary forms.‚Ä¶.Chandan says that it‚Äôs quite needless to knock on the head > and pain it, it‚Äôs equally needless to read the stony book of prosody ‚Äî > prepare your ear‚Äôs ability and do not stop the flow of words coming ahead in > your mind, let those come spontaneously. Then the inner inspiration will > bestow a particular form, a particular meter, which suits you and the poem > most, in which the theme of the poem will come out in a very easy and > spontaneous style and meter‚Äî this is Flow Verse, verse that flows without > having any pressure made by the poet‚Äôs intellect.‚Ä¶.All these poems demands > listening, not only reading ‚Äî and these should be hearkened from Chandan‚Äôs > voice‚Äî it‚Äôs a fantastic experience! I can say it with affirmation, as I have > myself heard it. When Chandan from a stage recite these poems with music or > modulation of tones, we don‚Äôt know what a game he then plays, whole audience > becomes undulating‚Ä¶..he does it with the help of many objects and symbols‚Äî > symbols may be in rhymes, may be in pictures, may be in music, the word- > symbols or rhythmic orchestra, may also be mathematical‚Äî Chandan extends the > dimension of the poem, its inner substance with the help of those scattered > elements‚Äîscene-touch-taste-scent, every emotion coming out of those > sensuousness suggested in a poem‚Äî and the poem becomes a Sarbangin Poetry > (total poetry), which is the sole quest and attainment of Chandan‚Äù. He employs his unique \\"golden language\\" ‚Äì mixing refined language, archaic words, spoken language and the repetitive use of compound portmanteau words (like \\"wikipedia\\") coined by him, as noted by Paul McDonald: > \\"You get the impression that Chandan is just having fun with language ‚Äì > chasing it around in the hope that it will lead him somewhere significant. > As always, of course, significance resides in the chase itself.... His > writing brightened up my day considerably.\\" Paul McDonald, New Hope > International Review online, www.nhi.clara.net/bs0287.htm  Literary career  Chandan received an Alpha Beta Honorary Mention Award in 1971 for his first book of poetry, Byabiloner Shunya Baagaane. His literature and mail art have been published in magazines and online media in India, the US, Italy, Bangladesh and Brazil. Chandan has been indexed in Who‚Äôs Who of Indian Writers (published by Sahitya Akademi), Asian Writers Who's Who, The International Authors and Writers Who's Who, Reference Asia: Asia‚Äôs Who‚Äôs Who of Men & Women of Achievement, Asia/Pacific Who‚Äôs Who, Asia-Men & Women of Achievement (published in Malaysia), Asian/American Who‚Äôs Who, Who‚Äôs Who in Asia and Who‚Äôs Who in the World (published by Marquis in the US). As an Indian delegate (with Sunil Gangopadhyay and others) writers to the Asian Literary Leaders Conference in Washington, DC in 1997, he met Nobel laureate Derek Walcott and other renowned poets and writers. Chandan was feted at the World Bengali Personality Conference Bangladesh at Dhaka in 2000 and 2004, and by Madhusudan Academy and the Bangladesh Poets Foundation in 2004 in Sagardanri. He has visited Europe, Africa and elsewhere in Asia, frequently performing a collection of his poetry entitled Chandan Gaan (Chandan Songs). Chandan's album of musical poetry, Jug Jug Jio (Music Millennia, Kolkata) was released in 1999. His poetry has been included in The Sound of Poetry, a CD published by the International Library of Poetry in the US in 2002.Under a Quicksilver Moon, The International Library of Poetry, USA. He has also introduced the concepts of Prakalpana art and Western mail art in India through the Prakalpana Movement. Chandan's bilingual (Bengali-English) magazines Kobisena and Prakalpana Sahitya: Prakalpana Literature have attracted readers, writers, mail artists and critics worldwide, including avant-garde writers and mail artists Richard Kostelanetz, Sheila Murphy, John Light, John M. Bennett, Don Webb, Brett K. Fletcher, Carla Bertola, Norman J. Olson and Jose Roberto Sechi.

It is located in the south end of the Bardeen Quadrangle on Green Street in Urbana, Illinois, facing the Illini Union. Engineering Hall serves all disciplines within the UIUC College of Engineering and is well known for representing the school's colors with its orange bricks and blue roof. In addition to many offices and conference rooms, Engineering Hall also includes two computer labs and four lecture halls. Engineering Hall also houses many engineering-based student organizations in its offices. History In early 1893, at the request of Professor Nathan Ricker, the UIUC Board of Trustees asked the State of Illinois for $160,000 to construct a building for its College of Engineering. After the state approved of the grant, the board asked for designs for the new building. However, they accepted designs only from the university's graduate architecture students at the request of its alumni.Dedication of Engineering Hall and the Inauguration of President Draper, http://uihistories.ncsa.uiuc.edu, accessed on October 19, 2009. Fifteen designs were received, and after much deliberation, George Bullard's design was accepted. Bullard was from Tacoma, Washington and was a student of UIUC architect and professor Nathan Ricker, the designer of Altgeld Hall. Bullard graduated from the University of Illinois in 1882. He was later made architect of the building. A general contractor was needed to oversee the construction. Bids were advertised starting on September 11, 1893. The project was awarded to Yeager & Schultz of Danville, IL. Engineering Hall was completed on November 15, 1894. It was the first University building constructed solely for the use of a single college.Engineering Hall, http://uihistories.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi-bin/cview?SITEID=1&ID;=79, accessed on October 15, 2009. The building consisted of orange bricks and its roof was dark blue. In fact, it was the completion of Engineering Hall that led to the adoption of orange and navy blue as the school colors. Floorplan 1st floor The first floor on Engineering Hall has many small offices for some of the student engineering organizations such as Engineering Council, Engineers Without Borders(EWB), Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, Tau Beta Pi, the Society of Women Engineers, and the Society of Black Engineers. There are four small lecture classrooms on the first floor, each seating about 40 people. Lecture rooms may be rented out to student organizations. As of 2008, the Kappa chapter of Theta Tau and the Theta chapter of Alpha Omega Epsilon use these rooms for their general meetings. There are two side entrances on either wing and a rear entrance that opens to the veranda overlooking the Boneyard Creek behind the building. The three sets of doors are locked at night, but UIUC students may enter the building to use the computer lab by swiping their ID on the scanner, which would unlock the doors. The first floor also includes a room with a photocopier and a break room with several vending machines. Just outside its west entrance are bicycle racks, a Tau Beta Pi statue of its insignia, and an open area known as Area 51, which is used to hold many social engineering events. 2nd floor The main entrance is located on the second floor. The second floor houses the offices of the deans of the College of Engineering. The deans and academic advisors are located here to answer questions and provide any other information about Engineering at Illinois. The College of Engineering Store, which sells apparel, gifts, and other merchandise, is located just outside in the hallway. The office of International Programs of Engineering (IPENG) is located on the east wing. There are several conference rooms on this floor as well. The second floor is only open to students during regular hours on the weekdays, unless for some special occasions. 3rd floor This floor has many conference rooms as well as administrative offices. Some social events such as receptions for UIUC Engineering Alumni, are held here. Like the second floor, this area is off-limits to students during the night. 4th floor The fourth floor houses two computer labs, known as Engineering Work Stations (EWS) as well as more administrative offices and conference rooms. These labs are maintained by the custodial staff as well as student lab assistants. The labs are accessible to students all day, however, only students in engineering may log on to the computers. Students must use their student IDs to get into the building at night. Computing and technologies As of 2009, each computer lab has 40 Windows computers. Four printers and two scanners are shared among these 80 computers. Only engineering students can use these computers. Students are given a printing quota of 300 units per semester. One black-and-white page costs one unit and one colored page costs four. Print jobs can be sent to EWS labs in other buildings. The labs are maintained by student lab consultants. Instructors may reserve the labs for their classes. The two labs are open for student use 24 hours per day, 7 days per week each semester. The EWS computers have the most current software used by engineering students. In addition to Microsoft Office, it also includes AutoCAD, Autodesk Inventor, Eclipse, MATLAB, and Iode, an educational software package developed by UIUC professor in mathematics Peter Brinkmann. The computers are updated with the latest software. For example, as of Fall 2009, Autodesk Inventor 2010 has replaced the 2009 version. Construction and maintenance Engineering Hall was designed by UIUC graduate student George Bullard. The contractor responsible for the construction was Yeager & Schultz. The building cost $162,278.40 to construct and featured an interior richly appointed with oak and a ceiling paneled in Washington fir. The graduating class of 1894 inscribed their class numerals in a stone tablet by the Green Street entrance as a class memorial. The 4-story building was long and deep, with twin wings. Engineering Hall an example of Renaissance Revival architecture.Campus Landmarks , , accessed on October 21, 2009. Engineering hall has undergone several renovations during the twentieth century. Some of these improvements include, wireless internet capabilities, air conditioning, sensor-activated hand dryers, improved heating systems, and overhead projectors. In Fall 1998, renovations were made to restore the building to its original stature.University of Illinois: Campus Tours, http://uitours.ncsa.uiuc.edu/engineering/enghall/, accessed on October 14, 2009. On June 12, 1998, the relocation of staff and furnishings from the building were complete. On August 1, 1998, work formally began and the renovation was completed in 2000.

Strawn Silas H. Strawn (1866-1946) and Charles MacVeagh (1860-1931) in 1925 Silas Hardy Strawn (December 15, 1866 - 1946) was a prominent Chicago lawyer and one of the name partners at the law firm of Winston & Strawn. He was also the president of the United States Chamber of Commerce during the early years of the Great Depression, in which capacity he supported the policies of Herbert Hoover and was a noted opponent of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. Biography Strawn was born on December 15, 1866, on the family farm near Ottawa, Illinois. He graduated from Ottawa High School in 1885 and spent the next two years as a teacher. In 1887, he studied law in the Ottawa law firm Bull & Strawn. He was admitted to the bar of Illinois in May 1889. He established his own law practice in LaSalle County, Illinois. Strawn relocated to Chicago, Illinois in September 1891, taking a position with Weigley, Buckley & Gray. In 1892, he joined Winston & Meagher and became a partner at the firm on September 1, 1894. On June 22, 1897, he married Margaret Stewart of Binghamton, New York; their marriage would produce two daughters, Margaret and Katherine Stewart. In 1902, Meagher retired and the firm was renamed Winston, Strawn & Shaw. (It would later be known as Winston, Payne & Strawn; then as Winston, Payne, Strawn & Shaw; until finally becoming simply Winston & Strawn.) Strawn would ultimately practice law with the firm for 52 years, serving as managing partner for 40 years. As president of the United States Golf Association, Strawn presents the 1911 United States Amateur Championship to Harold Hilton at Apawamis Golf Club. A member of both the prestigious Glen View Club and Chicago Golf Clubs, Strawn served as president of the United States Golf Association from 1911-1912. In 1913, Strawn was elected president of the Chicago Bar Association, and upon the outbreak of World War I, arranged for members of the association to take over without charge cases left unfinished by lawyers who volunteered to serve in the army. Strawn served as president of the Illinois State Bar Association, 1921-22. U.S. President Calvin Coolidge named Strawn as one of two American delegates to the Special Conference on American Relations with China, held in Beijing on October 26, 1925. Strawn was also chairman of the Chinese Extraterritoriality Commission. In 1927, Strawn was elected president of the American Bar Association. During his time as president, he pushed for higher standards in legal education, including college study before admission to law school and a full three years of legal training before being eligible for admission to the bar. As president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, in 1931, Strawn spoke out in favor of President Herbert Hoover's response to the Great Depression, arguing that it was up to business, not government, to solve the world's economic problems. He also strenuously opposed the extension of unemployment benefits to the unemployed. \\"If this country ever votes the dole,\\" Strawn said, \\"we‚Äôve hit the toboggan as a nation.\\" Strawn spoke out loudly against the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, stating in Congressional testimony: \\"I believe there is an abundant market for securities, if the Securities Act did not prevent their issue and distribution.\\" He also opposed the introduction of social security, arguing that it was one of many \\"attempts to Sovietize America.\\" In 1934, as former president of the chamber, and a leader of its conservative wing, Strawn called on Roosevelt to \\"stop experimenting\\", stop encouraging Congress to pass \\"hysterical legislation\\", and return to a policy of balanced budgets. Soon, however, Roosevelt had convinced the Chamber of Commerce to participate in his recovery effort and Strawn was appointed head of the Chambermen's efforts. Strawn was chairman of the Board of Directors of Montgomery Ward for a number of years. He also served as a trustee of Northwestern University from 1930 to his death in 1946.

A duke thus outranks all other holders of titles of nobility (marquess, earl, viscount and baron). The wife of a duke is known as a duchess, which is also the title of a woman who holds a dukedom in her own right, referred to as a duchess suo jure; her husband, however, does not receive any title. In the order of precedence in the United Kingdom, non- royal dukes without state offices or positions generally take precedence before all other nobility, in order of date of creation, but after royalty and certain officers of state. Royal dukedoms A royal duke is a duke who is a member of the British royal family, entitled to the style of \\"His Royal Highness\\". The current royal dukedoms are, in order of precedence of their holders (that is, not in order of precedence of the dukedoms themselves): *Duke of Lancaster, held by Elizabeth II *Duke of Edinburgh, held by Prince Philip *Duke of Cornwall (England) and Duke of Rothesay (Scotland), held by Prince Charles, Prince of Wales *Duke of Cambridge held by Prince William *Duke of Sussex held by Prince Harry *Duke of York, held by Prince Andrew *Duke of Gloucester, held by Prince Richard *Duke of Kent, held by Prince Edward (who should not be confused with the Earl of Wessex) With the exceptions of the dukedoms of Cornwall and Rothesay (which can only be held by the eldest son of the Sovereign), royal dukedoms are hereditary, according to the terms of the letters patent that created them, which usually contain the standard remainder to the \\"heirs male of his body\\". The British monarch also holds and is entitled to the revenues of the Duchy of Lancaster, and within the borders of the County Palatine of Lancashire is by tradition saluted as \\"The Duke of Lancaster\\". Even when the monarch is a Queen regnant, she does not use the title of Duchess. Non-royal dukedoms These are extant non- royal dukes in the United Kingdom. *Duke of Abercorn (Ireland) *Duke of Argyll (Scotland), (United Kingdom) *Duke of Atholl (Scotland) *Duke of Beaufort (England) *Duke of Bedford (England) *Duke of Buccleuch (Scotland), Duke of Queensberry (Scotland) (currently all one person) *Duke of Devonshire (England) *Duke of Fife (United Kingdom) *Duke of Grafton (England) *Duke of Hamilton (Scotland), Duke of Brandon (Great Britain) (currently all one person) *Duke of Leinster (Ireland) *Duke of Manchester (Great Britain) *Duke of Marlborough (England) *Duke of Montrose (Scotland) *Duke of Norfolk (England) *Duke of Northumberland (Great Britain) *Duke of Richmond (England), Duke of Gordon (United Kingdom), Duke of Lennox (Scotland) (currently all one person) *Duke of Roxburghe (Scotland) *Duke of Rutland (England) *Duke of Somerset (England) *Duke of St Albans (England) *Duke of Sutherland (United Kingdom) *Duke of Wellington (United Kingdom) *Duke of Westminster (United Kingdom) Forms of address coronet *Begin: My Lord Duke *Address: His Grace the Duke of _____ *Speak to as: Your Grace (formal and employees), Duke (social) *Ceremonial, formal, or legal title: The Most High, Noble and Potent Prince His Grace [forename], Duke of _____. Coronet A British or Irish duke is entitled to a coronet (a silver-gilt circlet, chased as jewelled but not actually gemmed) bearing eight conventional strawberry leaves on the rim of the circlet.

R. I. Gelvig was the first rector of the University and the dean of medical faculty at the same time. The first graduation of doctors had taken place in 1922; totally 523 doctors have been graduated during the faculty's existence. In 1925 the University was reorganized as a Pedagogian Institute and the Medical faculty was liquidated. Due to development of Crimea as a health resort, it was decided in 1930 to organize higher medical school here. The solemn opening of the Crimean Medical Institute (which consisted of one Treatment-and- prophylactic faculty only) has taken place on 1 April 1931. The first graduation (97 students) occurred on 17 February 1936. The second faculty, that is Pediatric, was organized in 1938. In 1939 the Treatment-and- prophylactic faculty was renamed into the Medical one. In the time of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the University continued working in evacuation (at first in Armavir, then in Jambul, Orjonikidze, Baku, Krasnovodsk, Kyzylorda). In sum, since June 1941 till July 1944 the Institute prepared 850 doctors. In the spring of 1944 the institute returned to Simferopol. In 1951 S. I. Georgievsky was appointed a director (subsequently a rector) of the institute (the university carries his name now). In the fifties the material base of the Institute was considerably expanded. Since 1961 the Institute begins preparation of medical shots for the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America. In 1970 new rector, professor V. I. Zyablov was appointed. In 1978 a new faculty (Stomatologic) was opened. In 1979 the faculty of Postgraduating Studies was launched. In 1981 the Institute was decorated with Order of the Red Banner of Labour. In the late eighties the Crimean medical institute was included into 3 top medical high schools of the ussr.The article in the newspaper \\"Crimean News\\", dedicated to the 75th anniversary of the CSMU (in Russian) In 1989 professor I.

The church is located at 633 West 115th Street. Beginning Korea was annexed by Japan in 1910 and there was a massive independence movement on March 1, 1919, known as the 3.1 movement. Koreans in New York City area gathered to remember and celebrated the 3.1 movement on in 1921 and decided to establish a church. That decision led to the first service at Madison Avenue Methodist Church (1723 Madison Avenue New York, NY). Documents relating to the beginning of the church are scarce, but the church celebrates April 28, 1921 as the church establishment day. History On April 22, 1923 the church moved to its own building on 459 West 21st Street with funds raised by church members and help from the Methodist Church. Then the church moved to the current location in 1927. Both building are four stories high and small (about 25 by 100 feet). It is believed that Morningside Heights was chosen as the permanent church location for the proximity to Columbia University, which had many foreign, especially Korean students. In addition to Columbia, Union Theological Seminary was also a center of theological studies. This location established the church as the intellectual church. At that time, there were not many Koreans in New York area. In fact, Koreans started coming to the US in 1902 () as farm workers. Later, after the annexation by Japanese, students and independence workers came to the US, especially east coast. Church members had their own business or students, with independence workers stopping by. From the beginning, independence of Korea was an important agenda. The Second World War ended in 1945, and Korean government was established in 1948. Many church members returned to Korea to be part of the new independent republic. The church fell into hard times with reduced membership but increased student population and some of the students remaining in the US after their study helped maintaining the membership. Republic of Korea goes through the Korean War and dictatorship, and the church is united again for democratization of their homeland. During that time, US immigration policy changes and membership increases from few tens to few hundreds. Luckily, there was a school (St. Hilda's & St. Hugh's School) just across the street. Arrangements were made to hold the Sunday worship service at the school chapel to accommodate the increasing membership. Relationship with the school was not always smooth, and the church holds Sunday worship service at a Broadway Temple (178th Street), and Union Theological Seminary for a while, but returns to the school. Korean Methodist Church & Institute has been the only Korean Church in the New York City area for a long time, but as there were more Koreans with changing of US immigration policy in 1970's, more Korean Churches were established. Many church members who had to travel far moved to new churches, Korean Methodist Church & Institute is sometimes known as the ‚Äúmother church.‚Äù New Building Construction of a new building started in July 2015.

Her best-known book, ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Key to Weaving\\", was published in 1945 and has since run to 3 editions and numerous printings. Its clarity is without parallel, and, more than half a century later, it remains a handweaver's prime source of information.  Early life  Mary Ellouise Black was born on 18 September 1895 at Nantucket Island, Massachusetts. The eldest daughter of William M. and Ellouise (Eldridge) Black, she received her early education in the schools of Wolfville, N.S., and graduated from Acadia Ladies Seminary in 1913. From 1914 to 1919 she was employed first by the Town of Wolfville and later by the Royal Bank of Canada. It could be said that Mary Black's career as a weaver started when she was aged eight in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, after she saw a picture of a Native loom. \\"Left on her own one day, she built a small loom. By evening, she had woven a grass doormat and the family wiped muddy boots on it for years.\\"Atlantic Spinners and Handweavers,\\"Mary E. Black: Key to Weaving Collection\\", brochure,  Occupational Therapy  In June 1919, at age 23, she was trained as a ward occupation aide at McGill University in Montreal under a special program established by the federal government for disabled soldiers. Her first assignment upon her return was to the Nova Scotia Tuberculosis Sanatorium in Kentville. From there she was transferred to the Nova Scotia Hospital in Dartmouth in 1920, where she taught crafts to men returned from the trench warfare of World War I under the \\"Soldier's Civil Re- establishment\\" department, and subsequently organized an occupational therapy program there for civilians. She once wrote that there was much more to be achieved through occupational therapy than had been realized, and perceiving no future for her own professional advancement in the province, she moved to the United States in 1922. In Boston she lectured on psychiatry and crafts at Massachusetts State Hospital for a year. Then in 1923 she moved to the Traverse City State Hospital in Michigan, where she organized and directed occupational therapy programs for the mentally ill and instructed student nurses in OT procedures. In 1932 she was transferred to Ypsilanti, Michigan, where a new hospital opened that was the first on the continent to use occupational (and recreational) therapy as a standard treatment for the mentally ill. Here she organized and directed OT and Industrial Therapy programs and instructed student nurses in OT from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. From 1939 to 1943 she re-organized OT and set up new programs for patients in specialized environments at Milwaukee Sanitarium in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. It was during this time that she began to gather material on weaving in order to assist a colleague who wanted to help a patient learn to weave. She also found time to join a number of occupational therapy groups and to produce several professional articles on Occupational Therapy and handcrafts.  Nova Scotia Arts and Crafts  \\"By 1940 Black wanted to come home to Nova Scotia. Word of the movement to revive Nova Scotia's rural arts and crafts had reached her in Milwaukee, and she started to write letters to anyone in the province who might advance her interests.\\" MacKay, Ian, Quest of the Folk, McGill-Queens University Press, 1994. p. 165\\\\. In 1942, she was asked by the Province of Nova Scotia to return to the province to organize a provincial handcrafts program. \\"On August 18, 1942, Harold Connolly, the Minister of Industry and Publicity and a tourism zealot, wrote to Mary Black, an expatriate Nova Scotian and authority on handicrafts: \\"It is important that we get our arts and crafts set-up into operation immediately and for that reason it is imperative that we secure the services of a director at once.\\" p. 164\\\\. In 1943 she became Supervisor of Handcrafts for the Department of Industry and Publicity (later Trade and Industry), a position she held until her retirement in 1954. Under her guidance, crafts people in rural communities were encouraged to develop and market their work, and classes in crafts were held all over the province to assist fledgling artists. She organized centres to teach and promote weaving, ceramics and needlework. As a result, a more tourism-oriented crafts industry emerged in the province. \\"Mary Black did not try to direct the efforts of craftspeople. Instead she acted as an enabler, helping producers to improve their work and to find markets for it\\".Lotz, Jim, ‚Äò‚ÄôHead, Heart & Hands: Craftspeople in Nova Scotia\\", Halifax: Braemar Publishing, 1986. During her tenure in the Handcrafts Division, Black provided valuable sponsorship for the development of the Nova Scotia tartan by Bessie Murray in 1953. She retired in 1954, but her 12 years' work in Nova Scotia had a lasting impact. Craftspeople found pride and profit in their work; cottage industries arose which continue to thrive and still provide finely crafted goods.  Author  Realizing a need for instructional texts, Mary Black extended her teaching of weaving through writing. Her best known work ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Key to Weaving\\" began as a series of notes used for occupational therapy purposes. In 1941, she made contact with the Bruce Publishing Company, of Milwaukee, in an attempt to help her sister publish a book on doll‚Äôs clothes. The publisher indicated that he really needed a weaving textbook. As a result, in 1943, she submitted the manuscript for ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Key to Weaving\\", but it was not published until 1945 due to lack of paper during World War Two. ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Key to Weaving\\" has been reprinted 19 times. Mary did revisions to her masterpiece and in 1957 brought it out as ‚Äò‚ÄôThe New Key to Weaving\\". This work became the bible of weavers internationally. During her lifetime it sold over 100,000 copies worldwide. A well-known weaver and author, Harriet Tidball, dedicated a copy of her own work ‚Äò‚ÄôFoundations for Handweavers\\" to \\"Mary Black, a \\"Guiding Light\\" to all of us weavers\\". When she was 85 years old, a still vital Mary Black said in an interview that, when she wrote her book, she had to pretend to herself that she knew absolutely nothing about weaving, \\"yet I had to explain it so that anyone who was a beginner would understand what it was all about.\\" MacNutt, Dawn, Life and Times of Mary Black, ‚Äò‚ÄôFibreArts: the magazine of textiles\\", v. 8, #4, July/August 1981, p. 63-65. She is the author of a number of other publications and from 1944 to 1955 she was writer and editor of ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Handcrafts Bulletin\\" for the Nova Scotia government. From 1957 to 1960, she was co-owner and publisher of the bi-monthly ‚Äò‚ÄôShuttlecraft Bulletins\\" with Joyce Chown.  Later life  During her lifetime, Mary belonged to a number of diverse organizations, including the Zonta Club of Halifax, the Nova Scotia branch of the Canadian Authors' Association, and the Canadian Crafts Council. She took a number of weaving courses, including one in Sweden and one at Penland, North Carolina, both of which were world-famous. She was also an accredited master weaver of the Boston Society of Fine Arts and of the Guild of Canadian Weavers. Mary Black also helped to establish professional organizations: Guild of Canadian Weavers in 1947, the Nova Scotia Craftsmen's Guild, and the Halifax Weavers' Guild. In 1971, the Atlantic Spinners and Handweavers (A.S.H.) appointed Mary their Honorary President for Life. Her later life did not see a curtailment of her activities; in 1975 she was instrumental in establishing the Tideways Co-Operative Housing Complex for senior citizens in Wolfville, N.S. and sat on its board of directors for several years. Mary E. Black died in Wolfville, Nova Scotia on February 11, 1988, at age 92.  Her Bequest  Her estate bequeathed to the Atlantic Spinners and Handweavers (A. S. H), a hand-made chest containing, in orderly sequence, the collection of superbly woven textile samples along with research notes and correspondence relating to her published works, most notably ‚Äò‚ÄôThe New Key to Weaving\\". To keep this unique collection secure and available for study, a permanent home was needed, so the Public Archives of Nova Scotia was approached. The Archives already had a significant collection of primary documents from Mary E. Black and her family as well as the manuscripts of her books. When the importance of the textiles to the entire Mary E. Black collection was perceived, the Archives made an exception to their normal acquisition policy and agreed to receive them as archival material in 1992.  Conservation Project  The collection of 1,350 textile items required careful conservation, which A.S.H. agreed to provide. Costume and textile specialists Clary and Sharon Croft of Halifax prepared a report listing all the items and their condition, and recommending a basic conservation plan and estimated budget. The estimated conservation cost of around $5,700 was well beyond the resources of a small volunteer society. A.S.H. gave $500 to defray the preliminary expenses, raised $1700 through a raffle, and applied for and received $2000 from the Jean A. Chalmers Fund of the Canada Council. Additional funds were solicited from the international weaving community. Ads in national and international weaving and textile publications and direct appeals to North American weaving societies brought immediate and gratifying results. Many weavers‚Äô and spinners‚Äô guilds from across the continent sent contributions both large and small; and many individuals who had been influenced by Mary Black‚Äôs work sent personal donations. Conservation work began in December 1993 with training sessions. Then over the next year, under the careful supervision of the Crofts, A.S.H. volunteers and friends removed the destructive adhesives, staples and acid papers, and cleaned and labelled the textiles using current basic archival standards. The volunteer hours for conservation work alone amounted to a total of 658 hours. As part of the initial agreement, the Archives provided working space and additional support services, such as photocopying. The project was completed in February 1995.  Virtual Collection  For the 20th anniversary of her death in 2008, the Atlantic Spinners and Handweavers planned a celebration of her life and work. An exhibit of selected pieces from the collection was arranged in the Archives and ran from October 2007 to February 2008. There was, however, a belief that more could be done to share this collection with the wider weaving community. The Archives had been creating some wonderful virtual exhibits of some of their collection and it was perceived that this would be an excellent way to share the Mary Black Collection. As a result of collaboration between the Archives and the Atlantic Spinners and Handweavers, weavers everywhere now have access to over 150 full color, high definition images of samples used in the ‚Äò‚ÄôNew Key to Weaving\\" . In addition, there are over 30 images from various periods of her life. It will continue to grow as we explore the extensive artifacts and documents that make up the Mary Black Virtual Collection.

It is part of the \\"Secret Series\\", a pentalogy of books written by Bosch, and is the sequel to The Name of This Book is Secret and If You're Reading This, It's Too Late.The Secret Series In the story, a famous chef named Se√±or Hugo captures Cass's mother in order to get Cass to bring him the legendary Tuning Fork for the Midnight Sun (the society whose goal is to find the Secret and be able to live forever), in hope that it will help the members achieve immortality. Plot The novel starts out with an African girl named Simone, who tastes a piece of chocolate for the Midnight Sun (as the book centers around the sense of taste, like the first novel, which centers around scent, and the second, which centers around the sense of sound). It is noted that she is a Supertaster, and is able to distinguish between almost any food, no matter how similar they are. Immediately after tasting the chocolate, she blacks out. Meanwhile, Max-Ernest,Yo-Yoji and Cass, three members of the Terces Society and the three protagonists of the series, are searching for the box in which the letter was found when she was a baby, as she earlier found out she was adopted and wants to find out more about who she is. While they search, they find a box filled with magazines that was dropped off at the front door of Cass's grandfathers' old, abandoned fire station, where the grandfathers live. Max-Ernest points out a magazine with a picture of the Skelton Sisters on the cover, the teen pop stars who were known by the two collaborators as being members of the Midnight Sun. Knowing this, the kids become suspicious of what they are doing, and discover that they are with Ms. Mauvais, the French woman who is one of the most evil leaders of the Midnight Sun, and that they have established headquarters in the country C√¥te d'Ivoire in Africa, where they take care of orphans and work on a chocolate plantation. Cass and Max-Ernest head to the old circus, where the Terces Society (which consists of Pietro Bergamo, the retired magician whose brother, Luciano, otherwise known as Dr. L, was captured by Ms. Mauvais and is now one of the leaders of the Midnight Sun; Mr. Wallace, an accountant who works as the society's archivist; Lily Wei, a Chinese violinist who escaped the Midnight Sun and is now the head of physical defense and martial arts, and Owen, an actor who appears as many different people in the series and acts as somewhat like a spy for the society) to tell Pietro and the others where the Midnight Sun is hiding. Mr. Wallace tells them that he thinks the legendary Tuning Fork is involved in the spa's plan with chocolate. Later, Cass and her mother, Melanie, or \\"Mel\\" for short, sign up for a cooking class run by the famous blind chef, Se√±or Hugo. After bringing up the subject of the Tuning Fork, Cass is invited to Hugo's famous restaurant with her mother, Max-Ernest, and other friend, Yoji, or \\"Yo-Yoji.\\" At the restaurant, the kids and Mel discover that it is extremely dark to the point where no one can see anything, since Hugo wants the diners' other senses, especially taste, to be heightened during their meal. After trying many different foods, Cass sees that her mother is gone. Outside, she reads the note given to her by the waiter from Se√±or Hugo, which demands the Tuning Fork in return for her mother. Later at the fire station, Cass and her friends search for the Tuning Fork, as they were told earlier by Mr. Wallace that by now the Fork, which was originally possessed by the Aztec boy \\"Caca Boy\\", would probably have ended up in a junk shop, and assumed that the junk shop he was talking about could only be Cass's grandfather's home. While searching, Cass finds the box in which she was dropped off by Mr. Wallace, and then sees on a television that the kids' principal, Mrs. Johnson, is in possession of the Tuning Fork. The trio heads to her house to her house to find out that she is completely opposite of what she says in school, and is gambling, smoking and not recycling. They blackmail her into giving them the Fork. Cass then gives Se√±or Hugo the Fork at her house, finding out that he is in fact part of the Midnight Sun, and will not give her back her mother as she told her friends what he had done, when she had been told not to. Meanwhile, the girl, Simone, awakes from her faint and finds a woman named Melanie in her cell. Mel gives her comfort and tells her that she has a daughter like her, and gives Simone comfort, telling her that her parents must have loved her and thought it best to send her to the plantation. Mel is then called to the Tasting Room, and Simone warns her not to eat any chocolate. At Yo-Yoji's house, Cass, Max-Ernest, and Yo-Yoji investigate the pictures of the Midnight Sun at the plantation in the magazine, looking for clues. They discover that they are at a zoo, since there was a \\"don't feed\\" sign and an American bird and are in fact not in Africa, but are located inside an artificial rainforest park somewhere in the United States (as the series is meant to be secret, the author states that he cannot identify the exact place in the country in which the park is located). After taking a train to the park, the kids camp out there (with the trio nearly eaten by a lion) and later journey through the rainforest, locating the plantation with the help of a Capuchin monkey. Hiding in the cacao trees on the plantation, the kids witness Ms. Mauvais herself talking to an elderly man, Itamar, who made a brief appearance in the first book, and dies a few days later. They also discover that Ms. Mauvais' first name is \\"Antoinette.\\" The trio then find a building called the \\"Pavilion,\\" where the Tasting Room is located (the very place in which Simone tasted chocolate for the Midnight Sun). The kids find three pieces of chocolate on a table, which is in fact a trap placed by the Midnight Sun. Cass and Yo-Yoji eat a piece each, though Max-Ernest refrains from eating due to his assumption of being allergic to chocolate. As Max-Ernest watches them fall into trances, Cass \\"dreams\\" about her and the Jester‚Äîa man from whom Cass is descended, and is the founder of the Terces Society‚Äîand their conversation about the Secret. When Cass wakes up, the three Midnight Sun members, Ms. Mauvais, Dr. L, and Se√±or Hugo demand her to tell them the Secret, as they believe the chocolate took her back in time to the Jester and was told the Secret. Cass truthfully admits that she does not remember the Secret, and they take her away to Simone's cell, which is right next to her mother's. Yo-Yoji, meanwhile, has disappeared, and Max- Ernest is the only one who can rescue the two kids. Max-Ernest eventually catches up with Yo-Yoji. Since Yo-Yoji fell into a trance that has him believing he is an ancient Samurai warrior, Max-Ernest was able to control him and command him to rescue Cass, her mother, and Simone. The kids go to get back the Tuning Fork from Hugo, rescue the orphans (who were really made slaves by the Midnight Sun), and finally escape the Midnight Sun. Later at Cass's house, Cass and Max-Ernest use the Tuning Fork to revive Yo-Yoji back to his normal self. The story ends with Cass being told by Pietro that she is the new Secret-Keeper, Max-Ernest tells Cass his parents are back together again and begins to like chocolate. Then eating the piece of chocolate Hugo had made for her, Cass falling into yet another trance. The story continues in the sequel, This Isn't What It Looks Like, with Cass in a coma as the piece of chocolate was exceptionally strong, and Max-Ernest trying to rescue her. Characters *Cass--Cassandra, or \\"Cass\\" for short, is the main protagonist of all the books. A smart, sarcastic, 12-year-old adopted girl (as discovered in the second book, If You're Reading This, It's Too Late), Cass embarks on adventures with Max-Ernest and Yo-Yoji to stop the Midnight Sun and its sinister plans to achieve immortality. She is descended from the Jester, who was one of the first to obtain the knowledge of the Secret, and was the founder of the Terces Society (the secret society that protects the Secret from being discovered by anyone, especially the Midnight Sun). She is a survivalist, and is always prepared for natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and tornadoes. *Max Ernest--Max-Ernest is a boy with several disorders, especially with the problem of talking too much. He wants to be a stand-up comedian and magician when he grows up. Max-Ernest is a very logical person, and is a bit obsessive compulsive. His parents are divorced due to not agreeing on a name; they ended up giving him both the names they each wanted when he was born. He is friends with Cass and Yo-Yoji, and is part of the Terces Society. *Yo-Yoji--Yoji, or \\"Yo-Yoji,\\" is a boy who had lived in Japan for about a year. It is noted that his ancestors may have been Japanese, as the chocolate he ate showed him acting as one of his ancestors, a Samurai. His teacher is Lily Wei, who helps him practice the violin, though he is more interested in his rock band that he was in back in Japan. He is also part of the Terces Society. *Melanie-- Melanie, or \\"Mel,\\" for short, is Cass's adoptive mother. She was once a lonely, single woman, wanting a baby, resulting in her adopting Cass when the later appeared at Larry and Wayne's doorstep. She was kidnapped by Se√±or Hugo in the book so that Cass would give him the Tuning Fork in return for her mother. *Larry and Wayne-- These two men are Cass's adoptive grandparents. They are obsessed with collecting old, broken objects, and store everything in their home, which is an abandoned fire station. Larry was once Mel's old high school teacher. Mr. Wallace was once their accountant. *Mr. Wallace--William Wilton Wallace III is the Terces Society's archivist. An elderly, irritable man, Mr. Wallace was the person who left Cass with her grandparents. *Pietro Bergamo--Pietro Bergamo is the current leader of the Terces Society. His background is revealed in the first book, The Name of this Book is Secret, when he was a major character, being supposedly murdered by the Midnight Sun in an attempt to obtain his journal, which may contain the Secret. He and Luciano, or \\"Dr. L,\\" are Italian twin brothers who were separated from their parents years ago and joined a circus. There they became amazing magicians, with the help of the fact that they both had synesthesia, or a confusion of the senses, which was also a major theme of the first book. Dr. L was kidnapped by Ms. Mauvais when the two were young, and is now her partner in leading the Midnight Sun. Pietro and Luciano's hatred for each other is now as strong as their love for each other once was. Now retired, Pietro gives Cass, Max-Ernest, and Yo-Yoji advice on their missions. *Lily Wei--Lily Wei, or Master Wei, is a Chinese woman in the Terces Society who was once kidnapped by Ms. Mauvais, like Dr. L. It is noted in the first book, when she was first mentioned, that she had synthesia, the main reason people were being kidnapped by Ms. Mauvais and the Midnight Sun. She teaches Yo-Yoji the violin, as she used to play in front of audiences when she was young, and is also the head of physical defense in the Terces Society‚Äî-in fact, she even keeps a sword inside her violin bow. *Se√±or Hugo--Hugo is a famous chef who is secretly part of the Midnight Sun. He kidnapped Melanie, Cass's adoptive mother, for ransom in order for Cass to give him the Tuning Fork. He makes the chocolate that brings Cass and Yo-Yoji back in time. *Ms. Mauvais and Dr. L-- The two leaders of the Midnight Sun, Ms. Antoinette Mauvais and Luciano Bergamo, or \\"Dr. L,\\" are alchemists who are searching for the Secret to immortality. Dr. L is Pietro's twin brother, and Ms. Mauvais is a French woman who is secretly over 200 years old, and wears gloves and a wig to cover up her true appearance. The couple play a superior role in the series, though have a bigger role in the first book. *Simone--Fourteen-year- old Simone is the African chocolate taster of the Midnight Sun. Being a super taster, one who has twice as many tastebuds as a normal human and therefore can detect flavors easily, she is used to test the magical chocolate that Se√±or Hugo makes. She was taken from her parents when she was eleven, and was kept prisoner at the plantation until the trio rescued her and Mel. *Romi and Montana Skelton--The twin Skelton Sisters are teen pop sensations who are secretly part of the Midnight Sun, and are presumably very old, as they must wear gloves like the other Midnight Sun members. *Amber and her friend Veronica, two popular girls at the trio's school, idolize them. The Skelton Sisters stayed on the plantation with the Midnight Sun throughout the story.

He is regarded an ethnic Macedonian in the Republic of Macedonia. Slaveyko Arsov was born in 1878 in the village of Novo Selo (now part of ≈†tip Municipality in the Republic of North Macedonia), then part of the Kosovo Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. He finished his elementary education in his village. He studied in Skopje, and later, during 1897-1898, in Sofia. His brother Mihail became a member of the revolutionary organization IMARO at the time when Dame Gruev and Gotse Delchev worked as teachers in ≈†tip. Slaveyko Arsov joined the IMARO in 1896. At the end of 1899, Slaveyko Arsov settled in Kiƒçevo, where he developed revolutionary activity. He spent one year in prison, and in the autumn of 1901 he became a freedom fighter in Marko Lerinski‚Äôs revolutionary band. With Marko Lerinski and Gotse Delchev, he toured the regions of Kastoria, Edessa, Florina and Bitola. Together with Captain Toma Davidov, he participated in the activities of the inspection band. In February 1902, Slaveyko Arsov became a member of an independent revolutionary band in the region of Bitola, and in the summer of the same year, in the region of Resen. In Resen, he and Nikola Kokarev,(bg) created the first committees of the organization. At the Congress of Smilevo, he was a delegate of the Resen revolutionary region, together with Aleksandar Panayotov, Velyan Iliev and Nikola Kokarev. Before the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising, Toma Nikolov and Donka Ushlinova joined the band of Slaveyko Arsov. He participated in the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising, after which he moved in Bulgaria. In 1904, he came back to Macedonia, together with the revolutionary bands led by Atanas Babata and Stoyan Donski. On June 9, 1904, they were betrayed by local Serbomans near the village of Gorno Gyugyantsi, Kratovo region, and were surrounded by Turkish military. After 6 hours of battle, the freedom fighters began to withdraw. The leader Stoyan Donski and 20 freedom fighters were killed. Slaveyko Arsov, who was injured, took his own life.

This organic reaction is of some importance in the synthesis of new organic compounds.Catalytic Carbene Insertion into C‚àíH Bonds Michael P. Doyle, Richard Duffy, Maxim Ratnikov and Lei Zhou Chem. Rev. 2009 Article ASAP Simple carbenes such as the methylene radical and dichlorocarbene are not regioselective towards insertion. When the carbene is stabilized by a metal the selectivity increases. The compound dirhodium tetraacetate is found to be especially effective. In a typical reaction ethyl diazoacetate (a well-known carbene precursor) and dirhodium tetraacetate react with hexane; the insertion into a C‚àíH bond occurs 1% on one of the methyl groups, 63% on the alpha-methylene unit and 33% on the beta- methylene unit.

The reaction is distinct from a metal catalyzed C‚àíH activation reaction where the metal actually inserts itself between carbon and hydrogen. Carbene carbon hydrogen insertion The metal employed as a catalyst in this reaction historically was copper until superseded by rhodium. Other metals stabilize the carbene too much (e.g. molybdenum as in Fischer carbenes) or result in carbenes too reactive (e.g. gold, silver). Many dirhodium carboxylates and carboxamidates exist, including chiral ones. An effective chiral dirhodium catalyst is Rh2(MPPIM)4 with MPPIM (Methyl PhenylPropyl IMidazolidinecarboxylato) asymmetric ligand.

Plot The book interweaves two separate stories, one set in the 14th century in Italy and Sicily and featuring Dante Alighieri, and another set in the autumn of 2001 and featuring a fictionalized version of Nick Tosches as the protagonist. The historical and modern stories alternate as Dante tries to finish writing his magnum opus and goes on a journey for mystical knowledge in Sicily. Meanwhile, Tosches, as something of a Dante expert, is called in by black market traders to attest to the authenticity of a manuscript of The Divine Comedy supposedly written by Dante himself. Included in the modern sections of the book are musings by Tosches on the state of modern publishing, the futility of excessively flowery poetry and prose, references to his own previous books (including a lengthy passage directly out of the introduction to The Nick Tosches Reader), the September 11th attacks, and the Rolling Stones. Louie Brunellesches, a small-time New York gangster who also appears in Tosches' novel Cut Numbers, returns in a smaller role, making this something of a sequel.

Biography Dimitar Andonov was born in 1871 in Stara Zagora, then part of the Ottoman Empire. He finished a military school for sergeants and served in the 12-th Infantry Balkan Battalion of the Bulgarian Army. On March 5, 1903, Dimitar Andonov, together with Nikola Valchev and Nestor Baykov, left the army. In Sofia, they connected with the foreign representation body of the revolutionary organization IMARO and in Kyustendil they joined the Prilep revolutionary band of Konstantin Kondov. Their fellow-townsman Georgi Staynov was already a member of this revolutionary band. Part of Kostantin Kondov‚Äôs revolutionary band entered into an ambush near the village of Toplica, as a result of which seven freedom fighters and the leader Nikola Bozhkov were killed. Dimitar Andonov and Nestor Baykov reorganized the band and managed to escape the ambush. Later, this section joined the revolutionary band of Petar Atsev. During the preparations of the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising, Dimitar Andonov was appointed head of the Prekoridski revolutionary region. He was responsible for the military training of the freedom fighters in this region. During the uprising, Dimitar Andonov and Nestor Baykov fought two battles with the Turkish military near Dunje and Staravina and they organized the logistics for the transport of gunpowder and weaponry from Bitola to Prilep. They participated in the action led by Petar Atsev, in the village of ≈Ωivovo, that was an unsuccessful attempt to take over the Turkish garrison. They had other battles at the Nid≈æe Mountain and the Farish Inns, in which they succeeded in disrupting the communication on the road between Prilep, Kavadarci and Krivolak. Gjorche Petrov refused their suggestion to attack the Turkish garrisons in the town of Prilep. At the end of the uprising, Dimitar Andonov returned in Bulgaria and again joined the military and served in his battalion. He participated in the Balkan Wars.

Structurally, the meetinghouse is significant because of its wood frame construction sheathed in clapboard and lined with non-load bearing wall of adobe. This construction technique was very unusual for a Mormon meetinghouse built at the turn of the 20th century. The first settlers built a post office and at the time a log one-room school house (16‚Äô x 18‚Äô) was constructed. The structure, with its dirt floor and backless plank benches, also served as a meetinghouse and amusement hall. In 1898, work began on the construct of the Emery meetinghouse. The frame meetinghouse was built of local lumber with the dimensions being 36.5‚Äô and 84‚Äô6\\". The meetinghouse was reported to have a capacity of 500 people. The frame construction was typical of many of the buildings in Emery County. However, it was seldom used in LDS meetinghouses. Ironically, a more expensive brick meetinghouse constructed in 1896 at nearby Huntington, Utah was torn down in the 1960s. Some people argued that the alkali soil of Emery County could not support the heavier brick structure and, therefore, the lighter frame meetinghouse in Emery did not suffer from a weakened foundation as did the Huntington meetinghouse. The meetinghouse in Emery, Utah was constructed under the direction of Bishop Alonzo Brinkerhoff. The construction was completed in 1900. Upon completion in 1900, services were however held in the chapel. However, because an apparent problem in paying the $7,000 construction cost, the meetinghouse was not dedicated until July 27, 1902. At the dedication services, Bishop Brinkerhoff reported that ‚Äúit had cost $7,000 to build the house, and that it was paid for.‚Äù Elder Rudger Clawson, an Apostle in the LDS Church, offered the dedicatory prayer and later in the meeting went on to praise all those, ‚Äú‚Ä¶who had assisted in building such a splendid meeting house, and the blessing of God would rest upon the people and crown their labors.‚ÄùEmery County Progress, August 2nd, 1902. The handsome frame church served the members of Emery well until the post World War II years, when the LDS Church shifted to exclusively build and use multipurpose meetinghouses. Accordingly, a new, modern meetinghouse was dedicated June 25, 1956. The old building was purchased by the city in 1967 for use as a town meeting and recreation hall.

Life He was educated at Lincoln College, taking the degrees of B.A. in 1505, M.A. in 1510, and D.D. in 1525 (3 July). He served as proctor for 1515, and, on the resignation of Thomas Drax, was elected rector of his college (2 March 1518). This position he held for nearly twenty years. He was also commissary or Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University. He received this appointment from Archbishop William Warham, the chancellor, on the death of Thomas Musgrave in the autumn of 1527, and took the oaths on 7 December. On Warham's death in August 1532 he resigned, and was succeeded by William Tresham, the nominee of John Longland, bishop of Lincoln, the newly elected Chancellor. As commissary, Cottisford was engaged in the attempt to stop the introduction of heretical Protestant books into Oxford, and in the arrest of Thomas Garret, parson of Honey Lane, London, who was active in the distribution of such literature, and was subsequently burnt at Smithfield in company with Robert Barnes and William Jerome. An account of the whole affair, and the dismay of Cottisford on hearing of Garret's escape from prison, is in John Foxe's Acts and Monuments. In 1532, Henry VIII nominated him as one of the canons of the new college, to become Christ Church, Oxford, which he erected on the foundation laid by Cardinal Wolsey, but he continued to hold his rectorship of Lincoln College, in which capacity he signed an acknowledgment of the royal supremacy on 30 July 1534. His connection with Lincoln College was terminated by his resignation on 7 January 1538, and shortly after he was collated to the prebend of All Saints in Hungate, Lincoln.

Early life  Born September 10, 1828, to Ezra and Mary Gilbert Simmons in Euphrates, Montgomery County, New York, Soon after Zalmon was born, the family moved to Oneida County, New York, and established a farm. After 1839, the family moved to Benton Township, Lake County, Illinois, where Zalmon attended common schools during the winter months. On June 12, 1843, the family moved to Southport (now Kenosha), Wisconsin. Simmons came to Kenosha with US$3 () when he was 15 or 21 years of age. His brother was Rouse Simmons who also served in the Wisconsin State Assembly for Kenosha. Rouse was a member of the Republican party and served in 1875. Simmons completed his schooling in Kenosha and then worked as a teacher between 18 and 21 years of age.  Business career  Among his pursuits, Simmons was the president of the First National Bank of Kenosha, Northwest Telegraphy Company, and the Rock Island Railway Company. In 1859, he was the president of the Kenosha and Rockford Railway Company, while also working at the Wisconsin State Telegraph Company.  Merchant  Beginning at the age of 21, Simmons worked as a general store clerk for pioneer Seth Doan for $200 () per year. Due to Mr. Doan's ill health, Simmons ran the store after six months employment. He bought the store after working there 16 or 18 months. He ran the store successfully for 12 years, until he sought other interests.  Telegraph  Simmons acquired half interest in the Wisconsin State Telegraph Company in 1856, became a director, and in December 1858 became its secretary and treasurer. In 1864, he was made president. The company became the North-West Telegraphy company when it merged with the Minnesota State Telegraph Company in 1865. Simmons was elected president of the new company. He remained president until 1881, when the company leased its lines to the Western Union Telegraph Company. At the time that Simmons invested in the company, it was almost worthless and had service only between Milwaukee and Madison. Simmons extended service into remote areas, with lines established through nearly impenetrable swamps and forests. Simmons was on the board of directors of the Western Union Telegraph Company. Simmons designed a wooden telegraph insulator and on April 16, 1871, purchased a cheesebox factory that became the Simmons Manufacturing Company to manufacture the insulators.  Simmons Bedding Company  One of his general store customers paid for merchandise with a patent for a woven wire bedspring. At that time, mattresses were made of cotton or horsehair. Simmons took the ideas from the patent and found a way to make the cost of manufacturing affordable. In 1870, Simmons founded what would become the Simmons Bedding Company, but the market had not yet developed for spring beds. Instead, Simmons manufactured brass beds that were sold domestically and internationally. The Northwestern Wire Mattress Company was incorporated in 1884 and in 1889 the name was changed to Simmons Manufacturing Company. In 1925, Simmons produced the Beautyrest mattress, for which the company is best known. It was sold at three to four times the cost of wire mattresses at the time for $39.50 () and four years later had sold more than $9 million () of the mattresses. The company introduced the pull-out bed, Hide-a-Bed, in 1940. By 1941, the company made springs, mattresses, steel beds and furniture and employed about 2,500 men. During World War II, it produced 2,700 different products needed to support the war effort.  Manitou and Pike's Peak Railway  Simmons surveyed the Englemann Canyon for telegraph lines to Pikes Peak in Colorado. He was instrumental in stringing telegraph lines alongside railroads and had earlier purchased a fifty percent interest in a telegraph company. After a miserable two-day trip to the top of the mountain on a mule, he thought that there should be a more comfortable and \\"civilized\\" way to make the trip. He got the idea of a train from the owner of a hotel where he was staying. Simmons then financed the building of the Manitou and Pike's Peak Railway in 1889. The railway itself was built by Italian laborers and was operational by 1891. It can still be ridden to the top.  Political career  In 1865, Simmons was served the Wisconsin State Assembly for Kenosha. He was a member of the Union party. He was mayor of Kenosha, Wisconsin from 1884 to 1886, during which time he refunded its debt of $1.75 million ().  Personal life  Simmons married Emma E. Robeson from Lake County, Illinois on April 20, 1850, in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Emma was the daughter of Captain Morris Robeson. Their children were Minnie, Emma, Gilbert, Zalmon and two sons who died during their childhood, Nelson who died at three years of age and Ezra who died when he was 13. Emma and Zalmon were Unitarians. He built the Gilbert M. Simmons Memorial Library and donated it to the city of Kenosha in memory of his son who had died in 1890. The building, dedicated on May 30, 1900, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Emma died on October 11, 1899. Simmons died on February 11, 1910, in Kenosha, and his son, Zalmon Simmons, Jr. took over the Simmons Manufacturing Company.

Some defects can be tolerated while others can be repaired, otherwise they must be eliminated. They are broken down into five main categories: gas porosity, shrinkage defects, mould material defects, pouring metal defects, and metallurgical defects. Terminology The terms \\"defect\\" and \\"\\" refer to two specific and separate things in castings. Defects are defined as conditions in a casting that must be corrected or removed, or the casting must be rejected. Discontinuities, also known as \\"imperfections\\", are defined as \\"interruptions in the physical continuity of the casting\\". Therefore, if the casting is less than perfect, but still useful and in tolerance, the imperfections should be deemed \\"discontinuities\\". Types There are many types of defects which result from many different causes. Some of the solutions to certain defects can be the cause for another type of defect. The following defects can occur in sand castings. Most of these also occur in other casting processes. Shrinkage defects Shrinkage defects can occur when standard feed metal is not available to compensate for shrinkage as the thick metal solidifies. Shrinkage defects will have jagged or linear appearance. Shrinkage defects usually occur in either the cope or drag portion of the casting. Shrinkage defects can be split into two different types: open shrinkage defects and closed shrinkage defects. Open shrinkage defects are open to the atmosphere, therefore as the shrinkage cavity forms, air compensates. There are two types of open air defects: pipes and caved surfaces. Pipes form at the surface of the casting and burrow into the casting, while caved surfaces are shallow cavities that form across the surface of the casting. Closed shrinkage defects, also known as shrinkage porosity, are defects that form within the casting. Isolated pools of liquid form inside solidified metal, which are called hot spots. The shrinkage defect usually forms at the top of the hot spots. They require a nucleation point, so impurities and dissolved gas can induce closed shrinkage defects. The defects are broken up into macroporosity and microporosity (or micro shrinkage), where macroporosity can be seen by the naked eye and microporosity cannot. Gas porosity Gas porosity is the formation of bubbles within the casting after it has cooled. This occurs because most liquid materials can hold a large amount of dissolved gas, but the solid form of the same material cannot, so the gas forms bubbles within the material as it cools. Gas porosity may present itself on the surface of the casting as porosity or the pore may be trapped inside the metal, which reduces strength in that vicinity. Nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen are the most encountered gases in cases of gas porosity. In aluminium castings, hydrogen is the only gas that dissolves in significant quantity, which can result in hydrogen gas porosity.Gas Porosity in Aluminum Casting, Compiled AFS Literature, March 2002 For casting that are a few kilograms in weight the pores are usually in size. In larger casting, they can be up to a millimetre (0.040 in) in diameter. To prevent gas porosity the material may be melted in a vacuum, in an environment of low-solubility gases, such as argon or carbon dioxide, or under a flux that prevents contact with the air. To minimize gas solubility the superheat temperatures can be kept low. Turbulence from pouring the liquid metal into the mould can introduce gases, so the moulds are often streamlined to minimize such turbulence. Other methods include vacuum degassing, gas flushing, or precipitation. Precipitation involves reacting the gas with another element to form a compound that will form a dross that floats to the top. For instance, oxygen can be removed from copper by adding phosphorus; aluminium or silicon can be added to steel to remove oxygen. A third source consists of reactions of the molten metal with grease or other residues in the mould. Hydrogen is produced by the reaction of the metal with humidity or residual moisture in the mould. Drying the mould can eliminate this source of hydrogen formation. Gas porosity can sometimes be difficult to distinguish from micro shrinkage because microshrinkage cavities can contain gases as well. In general, microporosities will form if the casting is not properly risered or if a material with a wide solidification range is cast. If neither of these are the case then most likely the porosity is due to gas formation. Blowhole defect in a cast iron part. Tiny gas bubbles are called porosities, but larger gas bubbles are called blowholes or blisters. Such defects can be caused by air entrained in the melt, steam or smoke from the casting sand, or other gasses from the melt or mould. (Vacuum holes caused by metal shrinkage (see above) may also be loosely referred to as 'blowholes'). Proper foundry practices, including melt preparation and mould design, can reduce the occurrence of these defects. Because they are often surrounded by a skin of sound metal, blowholes may be difficult to detect, requiring harmonic, ultrasonic, magnetic, or X-ray (i.e., industrial CT scanning) analysis. Pouring metal defects Pouring metal defects include misruns, cold shuts, and inclusions. A misrun occurs when the liquid metal does not completely fill the mould cavity, leaving an unfilled portion. Cold shuts occur when two fronts of liquid metal do not fuse properly in the mould cavity, leaving a weak spot. Both are caused by either a lack of fluidity in the molten metal or cross-sections that are too narrow. The fluidity can be increased by changing the chemical composition of the metal or by increasing the pouring temperature. Another possible cause is back pressure from improperly vented mould cavities. Misruns and cold shuts are closely related and both involve the material freezing before it completely fills the mould cavity. These types of defects are serious because the area surrounding the defect is significantly weaker than intended. The castability and viscosity of the material can be important factors with these problems. Fluidity affects the minimum section thickness that can be cast, the maximum length of thin sections, fineness of feasibly cast details, and the accuracy of filling mould extremities. There are various ways of measuring the fluidity of a material, although it usually involves using a standard mould shape and measuring the distance the material flows. Fluidity is affected by the composition of the material, freezing temperature or range, surface tension of oxide films, and, most importantly, the pouring temperature. The higher the pouring temperature, the greater the fluidity; however, excessive temperatures can be detrimental, leading to a reaction between the material and the mould; in casting processes that use a porous mould material the material may even penetrate the mould material. The point at which the material cannot flow is called the coherency point. The point is difficult to predict in mould design because it is dependent on the solid fraction, the structure of the solidified particles, and the local shear strain rate of the fluid. Usually this value ranges from 0.4 to 0.8. An inclusion is a metal contamination of dross, if solid, or slag, if liquid. These usually are impurities in the pour metal (generally oxides, less frequently nitrides, carbides, or sulfides), material that is eroded from furnace or ladle linings, or contaminates from the mould. In the specific case of aluminium alloys, it is important to control the concentration of inclusions by measuring them in the liquid aluminium and taking actions to keep them to the required level. There are a number of ways to reduce the concentration of inclusions. In order to reduce oxide formation the metal can be melted with a flux, in a vacuum, or in an inert atmosphere. Other ingredients can be added to the mixture to cause the dross to float to the top where it can be skimmed off before the metal is poured into the mould. If this is not practical, then a special ladle that pours the metal from the bottom can be used. Another option is to install ceramic filters into the gating system. Otherwise swirl gates can be formed which swirl the liquid metal as it is poured in, forcing the lighter inclusions to the center and keeping them out of the casting. If some of the dross or slag is folded into the molten metal then it becomes an entrainment defect. Metallurgical defects There are two defects in this category: hot tears and hot spots. Hot tears, also known as ,http://www.keytometals.com/page.aspx?ID=CheckArticle&site;=ktn&NM;=204 are failures in the casting that occur as the casting cools. This happens because the metal is weak when it is hot and the residual stresses in the material can cause the casting to fail as it cools. Proper mould design prevents this type of defect. Hot spots are sections of casting which have cooled down more slowly than the surrounding material due to higher volume than its surrounding. This causes abnormal shrinkage in this region, which can lead to porosity and cracks. This type of defect can be avoided by proper cooling practices or by changing the chemical composition of the metal. Process specific defects Die casting In die casting the most common defects are misruns and cold shuts. These defects can be caused by cold dies, low metal temperature, dirty metal, lack of venting, or too much lubricant. Other possible defects are gas porosity, shrinkage porosity, hot tears, and flow marks. Flow marks are marks left on the surface of the casting due to poor gating, sharp corners, or excessive lubricant. Continuous casting A longitudinal facial crack is a specialized type of defect that only occurs in continuous casting processes. This defect is caused by uneven cooling, both primary cooling and secondary cooling, and includes molten steel qualities, such as the chemical composition being out of specification, cleanliness of the material, and homogeneity. Sand casting Sand casting has many defects that can occur due to the mould failing. The mould usually fails because of one of two reasons: the wrong material is used or it is improperly rammed. The first type is mould erosion, which is the wearing away of the mould as the liquid metal fills the mould. This type of defect usually only occurs in sand castings because most other casting processes have more robust moulds. The castings produced have rough spots and excess material. The moulding sand becomes incorporated into the casting metal and decreases the ductility, fatigue strength, and fracture toughness of the casting. This can be caused by a sand with too little strength or a pouring velocity that is too fast. The pouring velocity can be reduced by redesigning the gating system to use larger runners or multiple gates. A related source of defects are drops, in which part of the moulding sand from the cope drops into the casting while it is still a liquid. This also occurs when the mould is not properly rammed. The second type of defect is metal penetration, which occurs when the liquid metal penetrates into the moulding sand. This causes a rough surface finish. This is caused by sand particles which are too coarse, lack of mould wash, or pouring temperatures that are too high. An alternative form of metal penetration into the mould known as veining is caused by cracking of the sand. If the pouring temperature is too high or a sand of low melting point is used then the sand can fuse to the casting. When this happens the surface of the casting produced has a brittle, glassy appearance. A run out occurs when the liquid metal leaks out of the mould because of a faulty mould or flask. s are a thin layer of metal that sits proud of the casting. They are easy to remove and always reveal a ' underneath, which is an indentation in the casting surface. s are similar to buckles, except they are thin line indentations and not associated with scabs. Another similar defect is s, which are buckles that occur in the cope of sand castings. All of these defects are visual in nature and are no reason to scrap the workpiece. These defects are caused by overly high pouring temperatures or deficiencies of carbonaceous material. A swell occurs when the mould wall gives way across a whole face, and is caused by an improperly rammed mould. ' occurs when metallic oxides interact with impurities in silica sands. The result is sand particles embedded in the surface of the finished casting. This defect can be avoided by reducing the temperature of the liquid metal, by using a mould wash, and by using various additives in the sand mixture.

The poem is mainly about the importance of nature. It says that books are just barren leaves that provide empty knowledge, and that nature is the best teacher which can teach more about human, evil and good. Wordsworth describes the beautiful songs of birds like the woodland linnet and the throstle.  Synopsis  The poem consists of eight ballad stanzas with 32 lines total. Each stanza follows equally except for the last that, in comparison, has a more irregular rhythm. The poem puts forward the message that nature is the ultimate good influence. It compares the city life (the notion of corruption) with a rural/natural life (the notion of purity) and moreover, the effect these lifestyles have on the soul. The poem's main message is that one can learn more from nature than from a book. The poem does not deny the importance of books but it only indicates that excess of anything, in this case excessive reading, can be harmful. one who is erudite but has no experience of practical life is as good as an imbecile. Nature through its laws teaches us the way things work out. Major themes in the poem are: appreciation of nature and importance of practical learning.

He was martyred at Clerkenwell in London, and is recognised by the Catholic Church as having the status of Blessed. Early life Thomas Holford, the son of a minister, was born in 1541 near Nantwich, Cheshire, at Aston'The Seminary Priests', Godfrey Anstruther, published by St Edmund's College, Ware and Ushaw College, Durham, 1968, entry for Thomas Holford in the parish of Acton.Nine Martyrs of the Shrewsbury Diocese by Kevin Byrne, accessed 7 November 2012 He was raised as a Protestant and became a schoolteacher. He moved to Herefordshire to become resident tutor to the children of Sir James Scudamore of Holme Lacy. There, through the ministry of a Catholic priest, Richard Davis, around 1579 he became a Catholic himself. On 18 August 1582, Holford entered the seminary at Rheims, where he trained to become a Catholic priest. He was ordained at Laon 9 April 1583 and was sent to England on 4 May the same year. Priesthood Holford, and his mentor Richard Davis, narrowly avoided capture when staying with the Bellamys of Uxenden Hall near Harrow-on-the-Hill, Middlesex. The Bellamy house was raided on 2 November 1584. Holford returned to his native Cheshire, but was arrested at Nantwich in May 1585. A letter survives, sent by Holford from prison to his brother, in which he asks for some of his clothing to be sent so he can have it sold for funds. In it, he signs his name as Tho: Holforde. In captivity, Holford was interrogated by the Anglican Bishop of Chester. The bishop left a description of Thomas as a tall, black (haired), fat, strong man, the crown of his head bald, his beard marquessated (shaven except for a moustache). Holford refused to accept exile, stating instead his expectation that he would be executed at Tyburn or Boughton. He was sent back to London for trial, but escaped by feigning insanity when his guards were suffering from a hangover. In 1586, Holford again narrowly escaped capture at the Bellamy house when Sir Francis Walsingham raided London Catholic houses following an unsuccessful Catholic plot to replace Elizabeth I with Mary, Queen of Scots. Holford, using the alias Acton, then stayed away from London for some time but returned in 1588 to buy clothes. He was spotted after celebrating a clandestine Mass in Holborn, at the home of Swithin Wells. He was followed to the tailors, and arrested. Martyrdom and liturgical cult Thomas Holford was held in custody at Newgate, where he was condemned on 26 August 1588. He was hanged (though not drawn and quartered) on 28 August 1588, at Clerkenwell. The executions which took place on this day and shortly thereafter were not all at the usual sites for executions in London, but were spread across the city to make an example of those condemned for their treasonous acts. This has been interpreted as a gesture of reprisal following the defeat of the Spanish Armada.'The Seminary Priests', Godfrey Anstruther, published by St Edmund's College, Ware and Ushaw College, Durham, 1968, entry for James Claxton In the 2004 edition of the Roman Martyrology, Holford is listed as one of a group of eight martyrs who died in London on 28 August 1588. Following the Roman custom of naming a principal martyr 'and companions', the principal martyr is one William Dean, a priest. Three other priests are named besides Holford: William Gunter, Robert Morton and James Claxton.

However, once units move next to another and attack, the game starts to differentiate itself. On the grid, only the \\"leaders\\" are moved and shown. Once combat starts, the battle moves to another screen in which your hero and his soldiers square off against the enemy leader and his squad. A leader starts with 8 soldiers fighting alongside them, have similar characteristics to the leader. For example, an archer's soldiers will all attack with a bow and arrow just as the leader does. However, the soldiers don't take typical damage amounts, as much as every time they are hit, the damage is represented in exclamation points. \\"!\\" represents small damage, \\"!!\\" represents medium damage, and \\"!!!\\" represents heavy damage. Take too much damage and they die off. However, they can be brought back via staying in strongholds or by the ability \\"recruit\\". Both sides receive three turns to battle back-and-forth, and during each time you have options. The standard attack option offers balanced offense and defense. The charge option is a less accurate attack that will have your units deal more damage than the standard attack, but then leaves them with less defensive and evasive power for the following attack. Selecting the phalanx option is the opposite; it will increase your team's evasion and accuracy, but lessens attack strength. If you use phalanx when your enemy charges, their attack will be more likely to miss completely. The last option is simply defending without attacking. After choosing the type of attack, the player must decide to either attack the soldiers in front first or go directly for the leader. The combat is won instantly as soon as the leader is finished, even if there are soldiers left. However, eliminating soldiers will lessen the enemies future attacks, and focus more of the attacks on the leader, so it is also useful to eliminate soldiers as well. Units are divided up into classes depending on what weapon they are equipped with. For example, the main character Ernesto starts off using a sword which makes him of the fighter class. Once obtaining another weapon, such as an axe, he would change to a barbarian. Weapons have different ranks, so the higher the rank, the better the stats. While there are characters who can only hold certain weapons, there are ultimately seven different weapon types with each type, each of which have two to three different job classes and skills depending on the specific weapon used, making the customization extensive. Localization The game is noteworthy for its rather rare localization characteristics.

Like in almost all Asteraceae, the individual flowers are 5-merous, small and clustered in typical heads, and are surrounded by an involucre, consisting of in this case two whorls of bracts, which are almost free from each other. The 3‚Äì5 outer bracts are protruding and triangular in shape, the inner about twice as many are lance-shaped and ascending. In Didelta, the centre of the head is taken by 3‚Äì5 clusters of bisexual yolk yellow disc florets, sometimes divided from each other by male disc florets, and is surrounded by one complete whorl of infertile yolk yellow ray florets. The common base of the flowerhead swells around the developing fruitlets, become woody and breaks into segments when ripe. The fruitlets germinate within this woody encasing. The species of the genus Didelta can be found in Namibia and South Africa. The genus is called salad thistle in English and slaaibos in Afrikaans.  Description  Fruiting head of kusslaaibos, Didelta carnosaThe species assigned to the genus Didelta are more or less succulent shrubs or perennial plants, with or without milk sap, that can have both alternate and opposite leaves, that may be felty hairy or hairless, may have a spiny tip, are seated and have an entire, sometimes spiny margin. The flowerheads sit individually in the leaf axils or on a peduncle. These heads are subtended by 2 rows of free involucral bracts, the outer 3‚Äì5 are protruding, triangular in shape, broadest and leaflike, the inner lance-shaped, ascending and may be spiny. Each head consists of a whorl of yellow, infertile ray florets with 4 teeth at their tips, surrounding yellow disc florets that each have five long, free lobes. Adjacent each of the outer involucral bracts, several florets are fertile, and the surrounding parts of the common base of all florets in the head (or receptacle) swell and eventually become woody. The receptacle breaks up at maturity, each section corresponding with one of the persistent outer bracts. These segments break free from the parent plant and act as the dispersal units. The ribbed, flask- shaped, more or less curved fruitlets germinate inside the protective encasement of the woody segments. These are topped by a pappus of winged scales that have merged at their base.  Differences between the species  D. spinosa lacks milk sap, has hairless, more or less oval leaves with spines that often enclose the stem at base, and the swollen, eventually woody segments of the receptacle containing the fruitlets lack spines. D. carnosa has milk sap, elliptic to linear, variably tomentose leaves, and the swollen and eventually woody segments of the receptacle containing the fruitlets are spiny. Two varieties are distinguished. D. carnosa var. carnosa is hairless or becomes hairless with age, while D. carnosa var. tomentosa remains densely felty hairy at least on the undersides of the leaves.  Differences with related genera  Cuspidia cernua has bristle-like pappus on top of the fruitlets and the fruiting head remains intact, while both Didelta-species have chaffy pappus and the fruiting head breaks into several triangular segments when ripe.  Taxonomy  Type specimen of Didelta tetragoniaefolia, colored etching by Pierre-Joseph Redout√© published in 1784The first to describe species that are nowadays included in the genus Didelta was Carl Linnaeus the Younger in 1781 and he named them Polymnia carnosa and Polymnia spinosa. The type species of that genus is Polymnia canadensis, named by his father Carl Linnaeus in 1758. Polymnia is however a rather unrelated plant from North America in the Heliantheae-tribe, with which it shares broad outer involucral bracts. The French naturalist Pierre-Joseph Buc'hoz described in 1785 Breteuillia trianensis, based on a plant that was growing in the botanical garden at the Palace of Versailles. In 1786, Charles L'H√©ritier described Didelta tetragoniifolia, based on the same plant from Versailles. In his Hortus Kewensis published in 1789, the Scottish botanist William Aiton reassigned P. carnosa and P. spinosa to Carl Peter Thunberg's genus Choristea. Joseph Gaertner created in 1791 the new genus Favonia for P. spinosa. Friedrich Wilhelm Klatt redescribed Polymnia carnosa in 1886 and named it Distegia acida. These generic names have been regarded as synonyms by most later botanists. Although Breteuillia is an earlier and validly described name, it was ignored by later botanist, and therefore it was suppressed in favour of Didelta. ; SpeciesFlann, C (ed) 2009+ Global Compositae Checklist The Plant List, search for Didelta * Didelta carnosa (L.f.) Aiton \\\\- Cape Province, Namibia * Didelta spinosa (L.f.) Aiton \\\\- Cape Province, Namibia  Phylogeny  Based on DNA-analysis, Didelta belongs to the subtribe Gorteriinae. This analysis suggests that Didelta is most related to Berkheya spinosissima, with which it shares the dimorph involucral bracts. According to this study, the relationships within the Gorteriinae are as expressed in the following tree.  Reassigned species  The species that were originally described as, or moved to Didelta, which since have been reassigned include the following: * Didelta cernua = Cuspidia cernua * Didelta annua = Cuspidia cernua  Distribution  The species of the genus Didelta occur in southern Namibia and the western parts of the Northern and Western Cape provinces of South Africa.

He is best known for his work on Australopithecine locomotion and the origins of bipedalism. \\"The origin of man\\", which he published in Science in January 1981, is cited as among his best-known articles. The 'C' of his name stands for Claude, but he never uses the name and is known only as Owen. Early life and education Owen Lovejoy was born in Paducah, Kentucky. Lovejoy obtained his B.A. in psychology from Western Reserve University (1965), his M.A. in biological anthropology from Case Institute of Technology (1967), and his Ph.D. from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in biological anthropology (1970). His father owned a small chain of hotels and the family spent their summers on lakes in Michigan, combining recreation with Christian charitable building work. Career Since 1968, Lovejoy has been teaching at Kent State University in Ohio. During this time Lovejoy has published more than 100 articles related to his research, including for general interest magazines as well as professional journals, such as Science, Nature, Bioessays and Scientific American. Lovejoy is most well known for his work on reconstructing Lucy (Australopithecus)‚Äîa near- complete fossil of a human ancestor that walked upright more than three million years ago. His research has covered a broad spectrum of human biological areas from eukaryotic mutations to ectocranial suture closures. Much of Lovejoy's research focuses on bipedal locomotion and its evolution. Many of his publications involve the thorough study of specific features of the hominid skeletal system or that of its ancestors. Perhaps best described as an anatomist, he is an adjunct professor of anatomy at NEOUCOM. In 2007 he was appointed the director of Kent State's new anthropology institute, the \\"Matthew Ferrini Institute For Human Evolutionary Research\\". In addition, he is part of a team that has conducted 17 years of biological analysis of Ardi (Ardipithecus ramidus)--a near-complete 4.4-million-year-old hominid fossil found in present-day Ethiopia. Publication of a special issue of Science in October 2009 about this research demonstrated that hominid history was nearly one million years older than believed, and provided new information on the evolution of human limbs and locomotion, the habitats occupied by early hominids, and the nature of our last common ancestor with chimps. Lovejoy has been active in paleodemography and human origins modeling. He has theorized that upright walking was closely tied to monogamous mating in early hominids (Provisioning Model).Mai, L.L., Owl, M.Y., & Kersting, M.P. (2005), p. 441 Interested in general education, Lovejoy has used a variety of venues to teach about science. Through consulting on television productions, he has reached large audiences. For instance, he worked with PBS on their 1997 NOVA special on human evolution. Based on the groundbreaking \\"Ardi\\" research, Lovejoy worked with the Discovery Channel on two specials related to his team's nearly two decades of research: Discovering Ardi (2009), aired after the special issue of Science was published, and Understanding Ardi (2009). In additional academic appointments, Lovejoy serves as clinical professor of anatomy at Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine, and a member of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Case Western Reserve University. He is a research associate for the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. Acting as a technical adviser for the Cuyahoga County Coroner's Office in Cleveland, Ohio, he has aided in crime scene analysis and testified as an expert witness in trials. In off hours, Lovejoy has played in a bluegrass band named \\"The Purple Mountain Majesty Boys\\". Legacy and honors *Lovejoy serves on the editorial board for Anthropological Science. *He has been ranked one of the Institute for Scientific Information's \\"Most Highly Cited\\" authors in social sciences. *In 2007, Lovejoy was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences. Publications Among the publications by Lovejoy are the following:  Notes a. Lovejoy is best known by the name C. Owen Lovejoy, which he uses for publications. His entry in The Cambridge Dictionary of Human Biology and Evolution lists him by this name.

Over the course of his career, Thomas made a total of 338 appearances in the Football League for five clubs over a period of fourteen years, scoring 211 goals. Early life Barrie Thomas was born on 19 May 1937 in Measham, Leicestershire. Career Thomas began his career as a youth player with Leicester City. His senior career began with Leicester City as a seventeen-year-old in 1954, but over the next three seasons, Thomas only managed to play in seven league games, scoring three league goals in the process. Thomas moved to Mansfield Town in 1957, and spent two seasons with the club, scoring 48 league goals in 72 league games. Thomas' next club was Scunthorpe United, moving there in 1959. Thomas' form in the 1961‚Äì62 season saw him score 30 league goals in 22 league games by Christmas 1961, and a total of 31 goals in 24 games in all competitions. Thomas' goalscoring record attracted attention from First Division clubs including Manchester United, Bolton Wanderers and Fulham. Leeds United had a bid of ¬£30,000 rejected by the Scunthorpe United board of directors. However, Thomas was eventually sold to Newcastle United in January 1962 in a part-exchange deal, which saw John McGuigan moving in the opposite direction. Newcastle also paid Scunthorpe either ¬£35,000, or ¬£45,000. In his three seasons at Scunthorpe, Thomas scored 67 league goals in 91 league games. Thomas' exit had a detrimental effect on Scunthorpe United's season; attendances at their home matches fell by 20% after Thomas left, and the club dropped from 1st to 4th in the League. Thomas spent two years at Newcastle United, scoring 48 goals in 73 games, before returning to Scunthorpe in 1964. Thomas spent a further two years at Scunthorpe, scoring 26 goals in 52 games in his second spell with the club. Thomas' final club was Barnsley, where he scored 19 goals in 43 games over two years, before retiring in 1968 because of injury.

The film relates the struggles of Principal Ron Stone and the rest of the school's administration, plus students and alumni to return the school, working with African American and Jewish alumni, to its previous glory in the years before the 1967 Newark riots. The film The film documents Weequahic High School which graduated some of the top students in the country after opening in 1932 and was \\"known as one of the top schools in America before 1960\\", with graduates such as novelist Philip Roth. By 2000, the school had disintegrated into a breeding ground for gang violence. The New York Times described the film as having the potential to be an ordinary story of a hard-nosed principal facing down gang members, but the film actually tells the inspiring portrait of a bold principal who works with gang leaders and Jewish and African American alumni to give his students a hopeful future.Genzlinger, Neil. \\"A Principal‚Äôs Principles\\", The New York Times, July 17, 2009.

It is not a universal system, but is used in some countries, including Argentina, Chile and Uruguay. It was formerly commonplace in Italy, though the practice has now been abolished there. This type of deal differs from third- party ownership, in that in the latter, the player's contract is owned by a non-footballing entity, such as a management company.  Italy  Co-ownership deals were common in Italian football, before being banned at the end of the 2014‚Äì15 season. The practice was sanctioned in Article 102 bis of the FIGC Internal Organizational Regulations (Norme Organizzative Interne della FIGC) and were officially known as \\"participation rights\\" (diritti di partecipazione). For a co-ownership to be set, a player needed to be signed to a team and have at least two years left in their contract. It worked as a regular transfer, except that the selling club would keep the aforementioned participation rights, i.e. the rights to 50% of the player's value. Unless the deal was terminated early by mutual agreement between all the parties involved, the two clubs had to agree on whether to renew or terminate the deal at the end of each season. In case they failed to reach an agreement by the league-wide deadline, the issue would be resolved via a blind auction. If the bids happened to be equal, or if none of the clubs submitted one, the full rights to the footballer would go to the club with which the footballer was registered (i.e. the club that acquired the footballer in co-ownership and not the one that kept the participation rights). When a player was under the co- ownership of two teams, he could still be sent on loan to a third side, provided that all the parties involved agreed on the move. The club owning the \\"rights of participation\\" was allowed to transfer them to another club, still provided that the all the other parties involved agreed. A practical example of this type of deal was when Brazilian striker Adriano was co-owned by Internzionale and Parma. Parma acquired Adriano for ¬£4 million in May 2002, with Inter keeping the participation rights. Adriano enjoyed a successful spell at Parma, which resulted in Inter paying ¬£13.5 million to buy out Parma's half share in January 2004.

As the Claymore II she provided the essential transport links to the remote Pacific territory of Pitcairn Island from New Zealand and French Polynesia, part-funded by the British Government until 2018 when she was replaced by the Silver Supporter. Buoy tender Konrad Meisel was built in 19681966 in some sources is erroneous by Jadewerft Wilhelmshaven GmbH, Wilhelmshaven for the Wasser- und Schifffahrtsamt Cuxhaven (Waterways and Shipping Office Cuxhaven) of the Federal Republic of Germany. When built, she measured 514 gross register tons with dimensions of 48.82m LOA, 44.30m LBP, 9.56m beam and 4.65m depth, and a draught of 3.25m. She was powered by two Deutz 8-cylinder diesel engines, totalling 1103kW (1500bhp), geared to a single propeller. Over the single hold an eleven-ton crane was installed. During Konrad Meisel's 30-year service with WSA Cuxhaven, she was responsible for the maintenance of marine navigation buoys in the lower River Elbe and the adjacent sea areas. In 1998 the ship was retired by the WSA Cuxhaven and sold to the South African Government. The tender was allocated to the South African Maritime Safety Authority and renamed Isibane, Zulu for 'light', by which time she had been remeasured as 486 gross tons. In 2004 she was sold to South African company Zonnekus Mansion Pty Ltd and transferred to the Panamanian flag. Passenger-cargo vessel In August 2009 Isibane was purchased by Nigel Jolly, of Stoney Creek Shipping Co Ltd, Palmerston North, New Zealand, modified to carry cargo and 12 passengers, and renamed Claymore II. Stoney Creek Shipping had been providing a passenger and cargo link to Pitcairn at the request of the British Government since 2002 with Braveheart, a former Japanese fishery research ship. Claymore II was contracted by the Pitcairn Island Council, and subsidised by the British Government, to make four annual round trips to deliver cargo and supplies to Pitcairn Island from New Zealand, loading at Tauranga. She also made eight subsidised round trips each year, from Pitcairn to Mangareva, French Polynesia, the nearest airport, for passengers to connect to the air service to Tahiti. Outside these scheduled services, the vessel was available for charter. As Pitcairn has no port facilities, all cargo and passengers where landed on the island from Claymore II by longboat. , there were concerns regarding the continued availability of the loading berth at Tauranga. However, the vessel was still servicing Pitcairn from the Port of Tauranga Pitcairn Islands Tourism (2016). The ship is the subject of a 2011 $1.80 Pitcairn Islands stamp.  Medical Aid Ship  In July 2019 the ship was renamed the YWAM Koha in a ceremony in Tauranga and after dry-dock maintenance she will be relaunched as a volunteer-based medical aid ship providing Primary Health Care, Dentistry, Ophthalmic Surgery and Optometry services operated by YWAM Ships Aotearoa. She will then be taken on a multi-port promotional tour around New Zealand to raise awareness, supplies and funds for her future deployments to the Pacific.

Glacial moraines are glacial debris of soil and rock that collect in front of, and along the sides of, the glacier as it flows across the land. The dark parallel lines inside the white central mass of the Viedma Glacier show where the debris-filled moraines have become entwined within the center of the new glacial ice mass as it forms. At right angles to the glacial moraines in the middle, crevasses, large, canyon-sized cracks, are apparent in the grey-brown ice that can be seen along the sides of the glacier.

In the left-hand board position (after 52. f4) Lengyel played 52... Qg4+! 53. Kh6 (53. Kxg4 is stalemate and 53. Kf6 is met by 53... Qe6+ with stalemate if the queen is taken, otherwise the game will end in perpetual check) Qg5+!! after which any of the three captures of the queen leads to stalemate. Darga - Lengyel, Amsterdam 1964, where Darga resigned in a clearly winning position. In the right-hand board position (after 41... R6xe2+) Darga played 42. Resigns??, instead of 42. Rxe2 Bxh4+ 43. Ke3 where White should win with his additional material. It appears that both players missed that 43. Ke3 would be possible.

The university and all of its intercollegiate sports teams compete in the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference (PSAC) within the NCAA Division II. The university sponsors 19 different teams, including eight teams for men and eleven teams for women: baseball, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's cross country, women's field hockey, football, men's golf, women's lacrosse, women's soccer, softball, men's and women's swimming, women's tennis, men's and women's indoor and outdoor track and field, and women's volleyball. Mascot IUP bear logo IUP originally dubbed its sports teams the \\"Indians\\", in reference to the town and school's name, and used a costumed student as a mascot. Following movements to eliminate Native American-related mascots, the university eliminated the Indian mascot in 1991, replacing it with an American black bear named Cherokee - deriving from the name of the university's fight song, though it retained the Indian nickname. In the early 2000s, the university actively moved to change the nickname as well. A campus poll in 2002 indicated the students favored the \\"Fighting Squirrels\\" as a nickname.Cregan, Amanda. \\"SC petitions to change mascot from Native American reference\\" The Penn, 25 November 2002. In May 2006, the NCAA ruled that IUP would be prohibited from hosting postseason championship games and using the Indian nickname in postseason events, a year after the university was placed on a list of 18 schools whose mascots were non-compliant with NCAA policies. Suggestions following the NCAA ruling included hellbenders, \\"Ridge runners\\", and mining- related nicknames, all relevant to the university's location in Western Pennsylvania. In December 2006, the Council of Trustees adopted the \\"Crimson Hawk\\"Fryling, Michelle. \\"Council of Trustees Approves Graphic Image of Mascot,\\" IUP Office of Media Relations, 9 March 2007. The mascot was introduced during the 2007 season-opening football game against Cheyney. In 2008, the hawk was named \\"Norm\\", in reference to the university's former name as the Indiana Normal School.\\"The Hawk Gets a Name!\\" Indiana University of Pennsylvania Press Release, 3 March 2008. With the change of the mascot, it was for the best that IUP would change its fight song, \\"Cherokee\\", as well since it makes references to a Native American tribe. In 2007, Dr. David Martynuik, director of the marching band, composed \\"Crimson Xpress\\", the new fight song that would replace \\"Cherokee\\" and would bring in a whole new era to IUP athletics. When a local sportswriter researched what a \\"Crimson Hawk\\" was, it was discovered that the domain name crimsonhawk.com was the site of an adult cartoon character named \\"Crimson Hawk\\". Some criticized the university's lack of research prior to making the decision. The site owner moved his content to a different domain name without the university asking or the issue being brought to court. Today, IUP remains the IUP Crimson Hawks in all of their sports and club competitions. Facilities University athletic facilities are roughly divided into two sections. On campus near the Eberly College of Business is Frank Cignetti Field at George P. Miller Stadium, a 6,500-seat artificial turf stadium that serves as the venue for football, field hockey, and track & field. Adjacent to Miller Stadium is the Memorial Field House, which used to be the host to men's and women's basketball, and women's volleyball, and additionally houses athletic department offices. Also inside the Field House is the Pidgeon Natatorium, which is used by the men's and women's swimming team. The South Campus Athletic Complex holds other sports venues: Owen Dougherty Field, home of the baseball team, Podbielski Field for the softball team, a soccer field and a rugby pitch. Beginning in 1999, a construction project for a university convocation center was authorized by Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge. Construction began near Miller Stadium in late 2008 for the complex that will hold a 6,000 seat arena. The Kovalchick Convention and Athletic Complex, which opened in the fall of 2011, is the current home of the men's and women's basketball teams and women's volleyball, replacing the Memorial Field House as these teams primary venues. Men's sports Football The university's football program dates back to the 1890s when the team competed against regional athletic clubs and other universities. In the early years, the team featured John Brallier, who would become the first paid football player. Official records by the university begin with the tenure of George Miller in 1927. The Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference was formed in 1951 by the members of the Pennsylvania state university system, and the university has been a member since then, winning 17 West Division titles through 2010. In 1968 the team competed and lost to heavily favored Delaware in the Boardwalk Bowl. Under Frank Cignetti Sr., the Crimson Hawks regularly appeared in NCAA post-season competition, including two appearances in the NCAA Division II National Football Championship in 1990 and 1993. In 2012, under Curt Cignetti, the Crimson Hawks earned the PSAC title and another appearance in the NCAA Division II National Football Championship. They ultimately lost to the top seed in Super Region One, Winston-Salem State University. In 2017, under first-year head coach Paul Tortorella, the Crimson Hawks finished regular season with a perfect 11‚Äì0 record winning the PSAC Championship and earning an appearance in the NCAA Division II National Football Championship.

He is the former manager of the Antrim senior hurling team. Cahill enjoyed a successful playing career at club level with Kilruane MacDonagh's while his career at inter- county level with Tipperary came during an uncharacteristic famine. He was a midfielder on the former team during a hugely successful period for the club in the 1970s and 1980s, the highlight of which was the winning of an All- Ireland club medal in 1986. Immediately after retiring from inter-county activity Cahill became involved in team management. He has taken charge of club and inter-county teams all over the country, including Portumna in Galway, Doon in Limerick, Graigue-Ballycallan in Kilkenny, as well as the Laois senior inter-county team. Cahill was appointed manager of the Antrim senior hurling team for a second term in November 2009. Playing career Club Cahill played his club hurling with the Kilruane MacDonagh's club and enjoyed much success. After enjoying some success in the minor and under-21 grades he subsequently became a key member of the club's successful senior team throughout the 1980s. In 1977 Kilruane MacDonagh's qualified for the final of the county senior championship with Borris-Ileigh providing the opposition. That game ended in a draw and it looked as if Cahill's side had lost their chance of victory. The subsequent replay was a low-scoring and dour affair, but Kilruane took the title by a goal and Cahill secured his first county title. 1978 saw Kilruane MacDonagh's qualify for a second successive county championship decider. Roscrea provided the opposition on that occasion and a close game developed over the hour. At the long whistle Kilruane MacDonagh's were the champions by 2‚Äì14 to 2‚Äì13 and Cahill picked up a second consecutive county title. Kilruane MacDonagh's had the chance to make it three-in-a-row in 1979. Club kingpins Thurles Sarsfield's were the opponents, but Cahill's side powered to a 2‚Äì18 to 3‚Äì9 victory. It was his third county championship title. With the treble taken care of thoughts turned to securing a remarkable fourth successive county title. Kilruane MacDonagh's qualified for the final with Roscrea providing the opposition. A close game developed, and at the full-time whistle Cahill's side were defeated by a single point. After a number of seasons out of the limelight Kilruane MacDonagh's bounced back in 1985. It turned out to be a dream season for Cahill and his club. After defeating old rivals Roscrea to take a fourth county championship title, Kilruane MacDonagh's represented Tipperary in the provincial series of games. Cahill's side made it all the way to the provincial final where they faced the mighty Blackrock club from Cork. In a one-sided game Cahill won a Munster club winners' medal following a 0‚Äì12 to 0‚Äì6 victory. Kilruane MacDonagh's subsequently qualified for the All-Ireland final where Buffer's Alley of Wexford provided the opposition. The game was regarded as one of the most exciting finals in the fifteen-year history of the inter-county club championship. Cahill's side fell behind early on in the game and trailed at the interval. The sides were level six times in the second-half, however, at the long whistle Kilruane MacDonagh's were the champions by 1‚Äì15 to 2‚Äì10. It was an All-Ireland club winners' medal for Cahill. Kilruane MacDonagh's reached the county final again in 1986, but on that occasion they were heavily beaten by Borris-Ileigh. It was the end of the glory days for Cahill's club. Inter-county Cahill's appearances at club level brought him to the attentions of the Tipperary senior hurling team selectors. He made his senior championship debut in a Munster semi-final against Cork in 1980. Tipp were defeated on that occasion as the county was in the midst of a hurling drought. Tipperary run of bad luck in the championship continued for the next few years, however, in 1984 the team qualified for the Munster final. Cahill was on the panel and was introduced as a substitute. It looked as if Tipp were heading for victory as the team had a decisive lead as full-time approached. Two quick goals by Cork put an end to this and Cahill's side were defeated by 4‚Äì15 to 3‚Äì14 in a memorable provincial final. Cahill's involvement with the Tipperary senior team ended shortly after this defeat. Team management Early experience In retirement from club and inter-county hurling, Cahill became involved in team management at all levels. In 1996 he cut his teeth at inter-county level as manager of the Tipperary minor hurling team. It was a successful year for 'the Premier county' as Cahill guided the minors to a Munster final victory over Waterford. Tipp later qualified for the All- Ireland final against Galway. A high-scoring and exciting game developed, however, at full-time both sides were level. The subsequent replay was another exciting affair with Tipp triumphing by 2‚Äì14 to 2‚Äì12. It was a major success for Cahill. Club Cahill has served as manager, coach and selector with a host of clubs all over the country. In 2004 he agreed to assist Limerick club Doon in their attempt to win the county senior championship for the first time. That campaign ultimately ended in defeat before the championship decider. In early 2007 Cahill moved west of the Shannon and took over as coach of the Portumna senior hurling team. It was a successful move as Portumna reclaimed the county senior championship title following a 6‚Äì12 to 0‚Äì11 trouncing of Kinvara. Cahill's Portumna subsequently captured the Connacht club title before lining out in the All-Ireland final. Birr, the most successful team in the history of the championship, provided the opposition. That game turned into a rout as Cahill's side powered to a 3‚Äì19 to 3‚Äì9 victory and the All-Ireland title. Cahill left the Portumna set-up shortly after this, however, his break from management didn't last long. In November 2008 he took over as manager of the Graigue-Ballycallan club in Kilkenny. His tenure there was largely unsuccessful. Inter-county Cahill as also gained a wealth of experience as an inter-county manager at senior level. In 2001 Cahill was appointed manager of the Antrim senior hurling team. Shortly after resigning from the Antrim position Cahill returned to management when he took charge of the Laois senior hurling team in November 2005. In November 2009 Cahill returned for a second tenure as manager of the Antrim senior hurling team. After a lacklustre National Hurling League campaign, which saw Antrim record only two victories in the group stages, Cahill's charges were drawn to play Offaly in the Leinster quarter-final. While many expected Antrim to be well beaten, Offaly were made to work for a win after extra-time. Cahill's side subsequently defeated Carlow and Dublin to qualify for the All-Ireland quarter-final for the first time in six years. Cork were the opponents and recorded a 1‚Äì25 to 0‚Äì19 victory in a game which lacked intensity. In 2011 Antrim once again played in the Leinster Senior Hurling Championship they played Laois in the Preliminary round and recorded a 1‚Äì21 to 3‚Äì12 win their first win since entering the Leinster Championship in 2009. They faced Wexford in the quarter-final but lost out on a score of 3‚Äì16 to 1‚Äì11. They entered the Qualifiers where they drew Westmeath in the Preliminary round and recorded a 2‚Äì25 to 1‚Äì19 win. In Phase 1 they faced another Leinster team in Carlow and picked up another win this time on a 0‚Äì23 to 1‚Äì12 scoreline. They then moved on to Phase 3 where they faced Limerick now ever their season came to an end after a 3‚Äì22 to 0‚Äì12 drubbing to the Munster side. Soon after the loss Cahill stepped down as manager. Not long after leaving the Antrim post Cahill joined up with the Armagh senior hurling team. He joined as part of manager Michael Johnston managerial backroom team.

The project was cancelled in 1840 as too expensive and beyond the survey's original scope. Material gathered before the cancellation mostly covers Ulster. Much was eventually published in the later twentieth century. The memoirs are a useful primary source for local history and genealogy of the period shortly before the Great Famine. Materials gathered for the projected memoir included: * 1824‚Äì1830 journals of the officers of the Royal Engineers in conformance to the \\"blue book\\" of instructions from Thomas Colby as head of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland. None of these survive. * 1830‚Äì1837 \\"statistical remarks\\" of parishes sent by the same officers to Thomas Larcom from his arrival in Dublin. These vary greatly in substance and reliability depending on the interests and abilities of the officer in charge of the particular parish. They are very extensive for counties Londonderry and Antrim, the first and slowest to be surveyed. As the survey matured and progressed east and south through other counties, it picked up speed in completing its primary mapping work, leaving officers less spare time in which to gather material for the memoir . * 1834‚Äì1840 memoir material gathered by the civilian \\"hill sketchers\\" sent to revise the original survey in the wake of the Royal Engineers. By 1837 the Engineers ceased collecting material, on the assumption that it would be collected when the area would be revisited by the hill sketchers. * Geological information gathered by Joseph Ellison Portlock; that relating to County Londonderry (and small adjacent areas) was published in 1843, after which the Geological Survey of Ireland was separated from the Ordnance Survey * Related to, but separate from, the memoir material are the \\"Ordnance Survey Letters\\" and Name Books compiled by John O'Donovan and Eugene O'Curry, of current and historical place names in English and especially Irish, and associated folklore and annalistic references. Only one parish was published by the Ordnance Survey, namely Templemore, County Londonderry (comprising Derry city and the adjacent North West Liberties of Londonderry) in 1837. This 350-page volume was a poorly edited agglomeration of material whose production cost of ¬£1,700 was three times the original estimate for publishing the whole county. A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland, comprising two volumes plus atlas published in 1837 by Samuel Lewis, was a similar work on a smaller scale, which undermined the case for a publicly funded memoir. The decennial census of 1841 also rendered redundant much of the basic statistical information in the memoirs. Work ceased in 1840. In 1842, Robert Peel, the Prime Minister, was approached by Irish politicians about reviving the memoir, and agreed to have the question considered by a commission, whose report published in 1843 advocated revival. However, only the geological survey was continued. The original memoir material and name books were donated by the Ordnance Survey to the Royal Irish Academy. The Public Record Office of Northern Ireland holds microfilm copies. The memoir text was published from 1990, in 40 volumes plus index, edited by Ang√©lique Day and Patrick McWilliams of the Institute of Irish Studies at Queen's University Belfast. A separate volume of some of the pen-and-ink sketches in the memoirs was published in 2014. The number of volumes per county is: fourteen each for Londonderry and Antrim; four for Down; two each for Donegal, Fermanagh and Tyrone; one for Armagh; and one comprising parts of Cavan, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo. There are brief unpublished statistical remarks for parts of Cork, Galway, Laois, Longford, Mayo, Meath, Roscommon, and Tipperary. In 1911 The O'Rahilly formed the Irish Topographical Society to transcribe and publish the name books and letters. Some Gaelic League members, including Arthur Griffith, worked on this for several years. The project was revived by Father Michael O'Flanagan in 1927 and a typescript was completed in 1930. Local selections were subsequently published, and scans of the originals were published online in 2012.

The major tributaries of the Wakefield River are the Eyre, Skillogalee, Pine, Rices, Hermitage and Woolshed Flat Creeks. Skillogalee Creek, which rises in the Skilly Hills near Penwortham, is a significant tributary of the Wakefield River. The high rainfall in the Skilly Hills contributes to the Skillogalee Creek being one of the few permanently flowing watercourses in the region.Water Allocation Plan for the Clare Valley Prescribed Water Resources Area, (Government of South Australia, 2009) . Dennis Creek is another tributary of the Wakefield River. It is a very short ephemeral stream which is located in the Clare Valley town of Auburn and only flows during periods of rain. Its headwaters are located in the hills on the western side of the town and it runs along a small gully, passing under Main North Road, and into the Wakefield River. The creek was named after the father of C.J. Dennis, who ran a hotel in the town for a time. History The first recorded sighting of the river was from John Hill (incorrectly named William Hill by some sources) in early April 1839, who named it after Edward Gibbon Wakefield, the promoter of the scheme of systematic colonization that led to the founding of the Colony of South Australia.http://trove.nla.gov.au/version/216940689 Hill was embarked upon the expedition which led to his discovery of the Clare Valley.

The Memorial Coliseum and Lloyd Center are located on or near Broadway. Many old movie theaters are on Broadway in the Hollywood District. The street also runs through historic Irvington and Sullivan's Gulch. Portland State University is also located on Broadway. The section west of the Willamette was the most vibrant street in downtown Portland even before it was renamed, in 1913, from 7th Avenue to Broadway, and this continued for decades. During the day, it was a bustling shopping street, and remains a busy shopping street today. The street hosted several movie theaters and vaudeville playhouses, and at night their many neon signs and lighted marquees gave the area a look that was similar to Manhattan's more-famous Broadway. Almost all of the movie theaters have since closed, most in the 1960s and 1970s, but the street remains the center of downtown's nightlife. Theaters still located on Broadway in downtown include the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall (in a former Paramount Theatre) and the Antoinette Hatfield Hall. Over a dozen buildings on Broadway are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, but the street is meant to be a busy and commercial, and to provide a route through which Portlanders could commute.

Family and education L√∂wenstein's father, Bernhard L√∂wenstein, had a clothing shop, which brought the family a modest income. His mother Jeanette, born Blumenthal, died of cancer in 1892. In 1895 Kurt L√∂wenstein went to Jewish private school in Hanover. In 1899 he went to high school where he earned tuition by delivering newspapers and holding after-classes where he helped school classmates with homework. Between 1904 and 1907 L√∂wenstein studied Theology and Philosophy in Halberstadt and he was accepted into the orthodox Rabbi school in Berlin. At the same time he also attended Philosophical and Pedagogical courses at the Friedrich-Wilhelm University. In 1908 he was offered the position of the Rabbi in Hanover but refused it because of religious doubts. On 29 April 1911 he married Mara Kerwel (1891-1969), a chemist. When they got married, they signed a following marriage contractsource: FES Archiv which is a proof of their progressive thinking and acting concerning gender equality: ¬ß1 On 1 April 1911 both of the contracties, out of free choice and based on love, agree to found the marriage upon equal rights and responsibilities. ¬ß2 As long as the marriage will last, both contracties and their offspring will use the common name Kerl√∂w which derives from the marriage. ¬ß3 To legalise the use of this name, state permission should be pursued. If this permission is not given, the contracties promise to use the name in all non administrative areas of life. ¬ß4 To be lawfully wedded both of the contracties will also subject to the state marital contract. However, by a word of honour they declare that the responsibilities and rights, described in the state marital contract will not apply as they find them redundant. In 1910 he finished his Ph.D thesis on Jean-Marie Guyau's pedagogic concepts. Politics A pacifist, L√∂wenstein applied to join the Red Cross in 1914 in Grodno (Belarus) where he took care of injured soldiers until 1918. In the meantime he joined Soldatenraete, German Socialist soldier councils, and identified himself as a Socialist. He joined the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (Unabh√§ngigen Sozialdemokratischen Partei Deutschlands - USPD) and became active especially in forming the positions on education and educational politics of the party. In June 1920 he was elected as a member of the National Parliament until 1923 as a member of the USPD and from 1923 to 1933 as a Member of the SPD. In September 1920 he was elected an Educational Counselor of Berlin by Election Committee of the City Council. The Brunderburger president denied him of this position in 1920. From 1921 L√∂wenstein was responsible for education in the City Council of Berlin ‚Äì Neuk√∂lln. In this time he organised progressive school tuition fees, providing more school meals for children. He organised special preparation classes for graduation for working class children. Together with Fritz Karsen they founded the Karl-Marx School, the first non-religious school in Berlin. From 1922 to 1934 L√∂wenstein was Vice-president and one of the co-founders of the Socialist Educational International (now the IFM-SEI). From 1922 to 1934 he was the president of the International Falcon Movement-Socialist Educational International.

Bred in Kentucky by Highclere, Inc. & Louis Roussel III and raced under the William Condren banner as his owner. He was sired by top stallion Risen Star, who in turn was a son of Secretariat. His dam was Hoist Emy's Flag daughter of graded stakes winner Hoist The Flag. He finished racing with a record of 7-4-3 in 25 starts with career earnings of $1,121,512. Star Standard was best known for his win in the grade one Pimlico Special and his runner-up finish in the grade one Belmont Stakes.Pedigree Online, Thoroughbred Database;.  Two-year-old season  Star Standard got a late start to his racing career and only raced twice as a two- year-old and only won a maiden special weight race on his second attempt.  Three-year-old season  As a three-year-old, Star Standard began improving in the spring of 1995. After a ninth-place finish to Thunder Gulch, Suave Prospect and Mecke in the Florida Derby he shipped to Kentucky. With only two weeks until the Kentucky Derby, Zito decided to pass the Derby and run in the second jewel of the Triple Crown, the Preakness Stakes. In the $500,000 Preakness, Star Standard was bumped coming out of the gate. He was pushed back into the rear tier but jockey Chris McCarron charged him up to the leader Mystery Storm. At the 5/16th pole he put a head in front while splitting rivals. He held on well until the final sixteenth and weekend to finish fourth still earning a check. Nick Zito had a legitimate excuse in the Preakness and decided to send him on to the Belmont. In the Belmont Stakes, Star Standard ran the race of his life and finished second to Dual Classic winner Thunder Gulch. In the late summer and early fall of the year, Zito decided to run Star Standard against the best older horses in training in two races. In the first of those races he finished a strong second in September to the incomparable Cigar in the grade one Woodward Stakes at Saratoga Race Course. In the second, Cigar again dominated the field in the grade one Jockey Club Gold Cup in October as Star Standard ran third to him and Unaccounted For.  Four-year- old season  At the beginning of his four-year-old season in 1996, Star Standard ran a courageous race in the grade one Gulfstream Park Handicap leading almost the entire race. Near the wire the gray Wekiva Springs wore down Star Standard and beat him by a half length. Later that year, Star Standard began to train like gangbusters and Zito needed to find a race to test his sharpened skills. He entered him in the $600,000 grade one Pimlico Special Handicap at \\"Old Hilltop\\" in Baltimore, Maryland. Star Standard broke from gate four and rushed straight to the lead under jockey Pat Day. He was the longest shot in the short field at Pimlico Race Course at 6-1 but he didn't act that way. Going into the far turn, Star Standard had led every step of the way in the first three quarters of a mile. At the top of the stretch, Key of Luck, Geri and Wekiva Springs all made a strong bid at the leader but failed to ever gain even terms. Star Standard won by an even length in front of Key of Luck. Geri finished almost seven lengths back in third and the 4-5 favorite Wekiva Springs could do no better than fourth, nine lengths back. Star Standard avenged his Gulfstream loss. On October 22, 1997, Star Standard had to be pulled off of the race track during an allowance race at Keeneland. Injuries that had kept him out of racing for a year had taken a more life- threatening surge to a condition known as laminitis, which his grandfather Secretariat was euthanized for. Initially, treatments appeared to be healing; but by early December, he had stopped responding to treatments and could not stand. The decision was made to euthanize him on the morning on December 9, leaving him with the same fate as his grandfather, but at a much younger age.

Philosophically, it is based on the organization‚Äôs desire to promote the purpose, aim, and goals of the organization, as outlined in its mission statement, and to communicate the benefits of achieving those goals to its stakeholders.

Key concepts Organizational philosophy A mission-driven, or mission-based organization can be non-profit or for-profit, public or private, governmental or non-governmental, philanthropic or religious. Typically, mission-driven organizations, are formed and/or managed to accomplish goals that extend beyond profits for stakeholders, shareholders, and owners to include a societal benefit. This could include an array of focus areas such as, education, youth development, protecting the environment, caring for the sick, fighting poverty, and promoting spirituality. Companies who adopt fair trade or environmental sustainability business practices could also be considered as an organization with a mission-driven focus.Bob Wall, Mark Sobol, Robert Solum , The Mission-Driven Organization: From Mission Statement to a Thriving Enterprise, Here's Your Blueprint for Building an Inspired, Cohesive, Customer-Oriented Team, Prima Lifestyles, February 24, 1999 Adherence to core values Values based organizations are mission- driven. Therefore, central to mission-driven marketing philosophy is adherence to the organization's core values, and using its mission statement as the basis for planning and implementation of marketing strategy. Market factors are taken into account, but the mission is the final determining factor. It has also been defined as being \\"mission-based and market driven\\".Peter C Brinckerhoff, Mission-Based Marketing: Positioning Your Not-for-Profit in an Increasingly Competitive World. New York: John Wiley & Sons (1997). 2nd Edition, 2003, Such businesses are increasingly being referred to as a \\"conscious business\\", or engaging in \\"conscious capitalism\\".

Keble College, one of the colleges of the University of Oxford, was established by public subscription in 1868 as a memorial to the clergyman John Keble. He was one of the leaders of the Oxford Movement, whose members were often called \\"Tractarians\\"; they aimed to reform the Church of England by reasserting its links with the early Catholic church. The college was incorporated by royal charter dated 6 June 1870. Under its terms, the governance of the college was in the hands of the Warden (the head of the college) and a council of nine to twelve members; the Warden could veto almost any decision of the council and so was in a strong position.Drennan, p. 17. Other Oxford colleges, in contrast, were run by the head of the college and the Fellows. By keeping matters relating to religion and the college's internal affairs in the hands of the council, rather than college academics (termed Tutors at Keble during this period), the founders hoped to maintain Keble's religious position as \\"a bastion of 'orthodox' Anglican teaching\\" against the opponents of Tractarianism.Cameron and Archer, pp. 15‚Äì16. The council even had power to move the college away from Oxford (subject to the consent of the Visitor, the Archbishop of Canterbury) if it transpired that Oxford was not a suitable home.Hibbert, p. 207. In total, 54 men served on the council, 11 of whom were college alumni; in 1903, Arthur Winnington-Ingram (Bishop of London) became the first former Keble student to join the council. Appointment was for life or until resignation rather than for a fixed term; the council had power to fill vacancies. The first members were drawn from the committee of the Keble Memorial Fund whose work had raised the money to build the college. The council met three times per year, including a meeting on St Mark's Day (25 April) ‚Äì this was not only John Keble's birthday but the date on which the foundation stone was laid in 1868, and so was adopted by the college for commemorations and celebrations.Cameron and Archer, pp. 14, 19. Most of the members of the council came from outside the college, and many did not have other continuing links with the university. It has been described as \\"an external Council of ecclesiastical worthies\\". There were often arguments during meetings about the future direction of the college when Edward Stuart Talbot was Warden (from the college's foundation until 1888). Over time, the Tutors came to have a greater influence on the direction of the college, a change recognised in 1930 when the council ceded control of internal administration and academic matters to the Warden and Fellows (as the Tutors were then retitled). It retained management of finances and ecclesiastical patronage, until Harry Carpenter (Warden from 1939 to 1955) persuaded the council to transfer its remaining powers to the Warden and Fellows.Hibbert, p. 208. This placed the college \\"on a constitutional par with the older colleges of the University.\\"Cameron and Archer, p. 59. The council ceased to exist after 9 April 1952, the date on which new statutes of the college that placed full management in the hands of the Warden and Fellows were approved by the Queen in Council.

TV Guide gave it 1 out of 5 stars, criticizing the film's incoherent plot. Dennis Schwartz of Ozus' World Movie Reviews gave the film a grade C+, stating, \\"At best, it's a so-so horror pic\\". Brett Gallman from Oh, the Horror! gave the film a positive review, writing, \\"A charming little homespun monster movie, it's a far cry from many of its gooey, splattery contemporaries, and it's armed with a solid cast that makes the it personable in the absence of an abundance of on-screen carnage. All told, a pretty good flick was mined from the old monster movie standard\\". The A.V. Club critic Keith Phipps described the film as \\"charmingly clunky\\", and said that it \\"plays like a cross between the then-omnipresent slasher films and a '50s monster movie\\". Diabolique critic Samm Deighan called it \\"a charming, if sedate mishmash of horror genres and tropes\\", but praised the acting, saying that \\"The Boogens' small, intimate cast is surprisingly solid, and its characters are likable\\", and that \\"despite the low budget, the sets and effects are solid\\".

Literally, the title is an idiom used to express that fear strikes quickly, not calmly as if on top of a donkey. The film is one of the most successful comedies of the India Mar√≠a franchise, having remained in the Cine Metropolitan for an astounding nineteen weeks. Plot Mar√≠a Nicolasa Cruz is do√±a Clarita's loyal indigenous maid. However, meanwhile do√±a Clarita is dying, she is leaving behind a large monetary estate, a mansion, properties, and Mim√≠: her affectionate Shih Tzu dog. Mar√≠a is with do√±a Clarita during her last moments, albeit her sister Paz, brother Marciano, nephew Braulio, and grandsons Raul and Laura are waiting anxiously downstairs for her death, believing they will inherit all her riches. Do√±a Clarita finally dies at the hand of a corrupt doctor employed by do√±a Clarita's relatives, and Mar√≠a inconsolably goes downstairs to the living room to deliver the news. As expected, Mar√≠a finds none of do√±a Clarita's relatives mourning her death. Believing she is of no use anymore, do√±a Clarita's relatives (or \\"The Vultures\\" as Mar√≠a calls them) fire Mar√≠a, therefore she decides to return to her native hometown. Marciano, Paz, Braulio, Raul, and Laura meet with the notary to hear Do√±a Clarita's will. To everyone's surprise, the will only mentions Mim√≠ (the dog), and Mar√≠a as her guardian. The family members go back to stop Mar√≠a from leaving the mansion. The \\"zopilotes\\" (vultures, Mar√≠a's nickname for Do√±a Clarita's family) convince Mar√≠a to stay in the mansion to take care of Mim√≠ as her new guardian. The \\"zopilotes\\" try several times to kill Mar√≠a along with Mim√≠ but their attempts go awry. Until Marciano feeds Mim√≠ a piece of meat with an explosive inside. Before Mim√≠ eats it, Mar√≠a takes it from her and cooks it for the afternoon meal. Braulio, unfortunately, receives the piece of meat and after cutting it, the explosive goes off. Mim√≠ ears were gravely affected. The doctor advises Mar√≠a to go on a vacation with Mim√≠ - to Do√±a Clarita's old vacation house in Guanajuato. Upon arrival, Mar√≠a and Mim√≠ are scared by the butler Franki who guides them through the haunted house. Both Mar√≠a and Mim√≠ survive two scary hands, a cyclop, a giant talking frog, a fern monster, a werewolf, and many more horrific things. To Mar√≠a's surprise, she discovers that those scary characters are the \\"zopilotes\\". They catch them and put them in a squishing torture machine. Mar√≠a and Mim√≠, on the verge of death, are saved by Franki who was a detective investigating Do√±a Clarita's murder - committed by her family members. Mar√≠a with all these surprises asks Franki, whose real name is Maldonado, permission to faint on the floor. As she does, Marciano, Paz, Braulio, Raul, and Laura end up arrested for homicide.

Their effort focuses principally on providing religious education. Since 1998 U.S. bishops have conducted an annual appeal in parishes across the country, with the proceeds going to dioceses in the United States and its territories.  History  In 1919 missionary directors from throughout the United States met at the University of Notre Dame to organize a national missionary society, the American Board of Catholic Missions, to serve the missions at home and abroad. Their focus was soon changed when the Society for the Propagation of the Faith was founded in Rome, with offices in countries around the world, for the support of missions worldwide. In 1924 the national mission society was refounded as a society in support of those missions in the United States and its territories that did not receive funds from the Propagation of the Faith. In 1972 ABCM became the Bishops' Committee on the Home Missions, a standing committee of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB).  Work  In 2016 parish collections across the United States provided $9 million for programs in 84 dioceses, ranging from evangelization, to Hispanic ministry, to education for seminarians and lay ministers. An annual report is produced by the USCCB Subcommittee on Catholic Home Missions. The Subcommittee also produces a quarterly newsletter Neighbors which acquaints Catholics with the various missionary works being subsidized.

It is important to note that for Sc>1, which is common in many liquid flows, the Batchelor scale is small when compared to the Kolmogorov microscales. This means that scalar transport occurs at scales smaller than the smallest eddy size.

The album was their debut LP and was influential on the genre.  Recording process  After rehearsing together for several years, Post Mortem entered Baker Street Studios in Watertown, Massachusetts to record their debut LP. The songs they recorded for the album were so old that the band did not even play many of them live anymore. While recording the songs, studio owner Roger Baker was convinced the band was creating a new sound in the genre. Most of the songs on the album were recorded relatively quickly and the cost for the entire album was only $900. The album was released in 1986 and became relatively popular to the underground scene.

It is estimated that nearly 20,000 copies of the album were distributed. Now the album is considered a sort of cult classic that influenced a lot of later artists in similar genres. One author summarizes the album's influence by saying that it, \\"is now as remembered for its unusual styling and flirtation with jazz and punk as it is as an overlooked death metal cornerstone.\\" Overall, the album garnered generally positive reviews, but failed to make the radar of any large publishers.  Criticism  While touring, the band received significant criticism over the role of experimental and classical music in their songs. Fans reacted poorly to the live performances of some tracks and the experimental direction the band was heading.  Re-release  In 2011 it was reported that the album will be re-released under the New Renaissance Records label as a CD. The album has been digitally remastered and will include The Missing Link EP, as well as new artwork and liner notes. The release date has not yet been confirmed.

As of the 2010 census, the city population was 5,437. History In 1856, James B. Hovey named the community after a town near Mobile, Alabama.\\"Miami County 2008 Visitors Guide\\", pages 17-18 \\"Being somewhat enthusiastic in my estimation of its future, it having all advantages of timber and water, and on a line that must be traveled between Olathe and Paola, I concluded to myself, as there was no one else to conclude with, that this was a good place for a town.\\" ‚Äì J.B. Hovey, 1857 Hovey served as the communities first postmaster. Also that year, Hovey built the first building in town, the Spring Hill Hotel. The two-story structure, also known as the \\"Old Traveler's Rest\\" was located on the highest elevation in town. In January 1859 Celia Ann Dayton, a doctor in Vermont, became the first woman doctor in the state of Kansas by moving to Spring Hill. She arrived with her adopted son Hiram Eugene, also a doctor, and her husband Amos arrived a few months later. Hiram was killed in January 1862 during the American Civil War after being discovered as a spy for the Union. Also in 1862, Celia divorced her husband, which was very uncommon for the time period. Celia frequently aided black refugees, and is reported to have been part of the underground railroad. In the fall of 1862, Spring Hill avoided Quantrill's Raiders entering the town when a farmer talked to them on their way. He calmly convinced them there were soldiers in town, when there were not. This deterred them from continuing. However, a year later in 1863, the Quantrill Raiders did march on Spring Hill, looting businesses in town and stealing from local farmers. At least one citizen was killed. By the 1870s, Spring Hill was growing in population and commerce. However, a railroad to come right through the town wanted to bypass Spring Hill unless it paid $15,000 to grade the land there. The residents didn't want to share the costs, and the tracks were moved to approximately a half-mile east of the original town square. The town's businesses then quickly moved to be closer to the train depot and tracks. In 1874, the country's economic depression hit Spring Hill. Also that year, swarms of grasshoppers devoured plant life, then moved on to items such as clothes, blankets and shoes. Even leather harnesses, pitch fork handles, and fence posts were not immune to them. As a result, water sources were polluted, and gardens and crops were devastated. Livestock were nearly inedible. Spring Hill's Civic Center (2008) In the 1920s the Spring Hill Rural High School District was established, and in 1926, the original city jail was constructed by A. H. Starbuck. By the 1950s most of the rural area surrounding Spring Hill also had electricity. In the 1960s Spring Hill's elementary and high school merged due to a state law requiring public schooling for kindergarten through the 12th grade. Spring Hill's growth had nearly stopped by the 1980s until community leaders decided to focus on attracting industry to develop there. This strategy drew new residents, followed by increased retail and service businesses. On May 20, 1957 around 7:00 p.m., an F5 tornado, known as the Ruskin Heights tornado, struck Spring Hill and surrounding towns. Elston Steel Factory along with 21 homes and 18 barns were destroyed in the storm, with most damage occurring between Allen and King Street, north of Jackson Street. The cemetery also received a lot of damage to the trees and gravestones.Davis Family Does Not Survive Tornado Retrieved June 10, 2016. The only fatalities in Spring Hill was the Davis Family, including Isam Davis, his wife Barbara, and their daughters Tamara and Pamela (ages five and six). A neighbor reported they were killed trying to leave their home and make it to their station wagon to escape the storm. Their home was completely destroyed by the tornado and their bodies were found close to 207th Street and US 169 Highway (present day Webster Street). Davis Street in Spring Hill is named after the family.1957 Tornado Destroys Homes, Lives In Spring Hill Retrieved June 10, 2016.

Raleigh only managed to play six times during his three seasons at Collingwood and after the war crossed to Carlton. In contrast to his stint with Collingwood, Raleigh barely missed a game for Carlton and played in five finals. The last of those was the narrow loss to Richmond in the 1921 VFL Grand Final, which he played from a half back flank. After leaving Carlton, Raleigh went to Brunswick in the VFA. He became captain-coach of the team, and led it to the 1925 VFA premiership. In a 1926 match against Northcote, Raleigh and teammate Hassett reported to the club secretary that a boundary umpire had used abusive language towards them during the match. The Association found the boundary umpire not guilty; and, it found Raleigh and Hassett guilty of having made a false charge against the boundary umpire, and deregistered both players until 31 May 1927. The club was so incensed by the outcome that it decided to withdraw from the Association immediately. The club was ultimately readmitted to the VFA prior to the following season under a new committee, but Raleigh retired before his suspension was finished.

It was absorbed into the Tallaght Hospital in June 1998. History The hospital, which was originally intended only for Protestant patients, was founded by Dr. Albert Jasper Walsh (1815‚Äì1880) when he was just 26 years old, in 1839. It was named after Adelaide, wife of William IV. The well-known physicians John T. Kirby and Maurice Colles were honorary surgeons. Its first premises was at 43 Bride Street and it continued there until 1846. It was then closed for a time and, after new funding was secured, re-opened in Peter Street in 1858, close to two existing schools of medicine. One of these, the Ledwich School, was incorporated into the hospital in 1894.Mitchell, 1990 The founder of the Sunbeam House, Lucinda Sullivan, served as the first lady superintendent of the hospital from 1872 to 1875. The Adelaide hospital was a general teaching hospital for many years and in the forefront of medical advances. Its charter, which was one of the last royal charters granted in Ireland, dates from 1920.Fleetwood, 1983 When the Irish Hospitals' Sweepstake was set up in 1930 to finance hospitals, the Adelaide was the only hospital at the time not to accept money from the Hospitals Trust, as the governors disapproved of sweepstakes. It was absorbed into the Tallaght Hospital in June 1998. The former hospital building in Peter Street has been converted into apartments and office suites known as Adelaide Chambers.

The company was founded on November 16, 1896. Already in the next year, a 750 mm narrow-gauge line running along the Garte stream was laid in the direction of Rittmarshausen. Originally going from G√∂ttingen to Rittmarshausen, it was extended in 1907 to reach Duderstadt. The section to Duderstadt was not very popular and was temporarily discontinued in 1922. It was soon reinstated but permanently discontinued in 1931. With the rise of private vehicles and an adequate bus service, the remaining service was discontinued in the 1950s: in 1957 regular passenger service on the line ceased, and in 1959 the line closed with the last of its freight service. The tracks were dismantled.

He was one of the commanders of the Bund during the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Interwar Poland Orzech joined the Bund in 1907 and was in charge of the party's newspaper, Forverts.

In April 1942 the Germans began mass executions in the ghetto, supposedly as a way of combating underground literature. Orzech was summoned by Judenrat president Adam Czerniak√≥w and asked that the Bund cease circulating its illegal newspapers. However, Orzech correctly surmised that the newspapers were just an excuse and that the mass executions were simply the first step in total extermination of Warsaw's Jews. The Bund refused Czerniak√≥w's request.Bernard Goldstein, \\"Five years in the Warsaw Ghetto: (The stars bear witness)\\", AK Press, 2005, pg. 89,96, 153 Orzech also wrote bulletins and proclamations to the residents of the ghetto not to trust the Germans and not to volunteer for supposed \\"labor in Germany\\" from the Umschlagplatz (which was in fact a collection point for deportation to the Treblinka extermination camp) Most likely he was one of the organizers of the Antifascist Block (a group representing leftist Zionist and secular Jewish groups) and served as the Bund's representative at its conferences. Generally, Orzech saw the struggle of Poles and Jews against the German occupants as one and the same and favored the merger of Jewish resistance into Polish resistance.≈öƒÅrƒÅ Bender, \\"The Jews of Bialystok During World War II and the Holocaust\\", UPNE, 2008, pg. 179, He, along with Leon Feiner, wrote the telegram which informed the Bundist member of the Polish government in Exile, Szmul Zygielbojm, about the outbreak of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.

The name refers to the founders' message of there being another economic canon, alternative to the ruling neoclassical economics. Their suggestions, they claim, are valid for and can be applicated in the first, second and third world.http://www.othercanon.org/papers/organisation.html  History  The Other Canon was founded in 2000 by Erik Reinert and 10 co-founders with different backgrounds in economics and social sciences. The founders also have distinct backgrounds coming from North America, Latin America, Asia, Eastern and Western Europe. Notable names among them are Wolfgang Drechsler, Carlota Perez and Geoffrey Hodgson. In addition to the executive chairman Erik Reinert and the earlier mentioned Drechsler, the current executive board also employs Rainer Kattel.http://www.othercanon.org/board/index.html  Theories and influences  The ideological foundation of The Other Canon is not defined in a left-right perspective, claiming both sides have fallen into the same traps failing to explain and develop valid theories for today's economics.Canon 11 99.doc The Other Canon - Reconstructing the Theory of Uneven Economic Development Central to the group is the Theory of Uneven Development, which aims to explain how and why the international economic landscape (of rich and poor nations) is as it is today. History of Economic Policy is used as an important tool in this process.http://www.othercanon.org/documenting/index.html The Other Canon is highly eclectic and gathers ideas from many authors of various epochs. Joseph Schumpeter, John Maynard Keynes, Karl Marx, Gunnar Myrdal, Gustav von Schmoller, Werner Sombart, Nicholas Kaldor, Max Weber and Adam Smith (for considerations of the primary sector) are among the theorists to have influenced The Other Canon. In accordance with Schumpeter, The Other Canon emphasizes the role of \\"man the producer\\" over \\"man the consumer\\" and intends to seek the reasons for growth and innovation rather than seeing it as something innate to capital and a simple result of adding it to human labour. They argue that the state is needed to stimulate entrepreneurship to maximise growth.Erik Reinert. The Role of the State in Economic Growth The importance of role of the state is also underlined in development economics. In his book How Rich Countries Got Rich ... and Why Poor Countries Stay Poor (2007), Reinert criticises liberal economists for ignoring empirical evidence when they promote free-trade as the solution to third world countries. He claims poor countries should, and should be allowed to, use protectionism to build up their own industries until they can compete internationally and that the state should be involved in this process.Erik Reinert. How Rich Countries Got Rich ... and Why Poor Countries Stay Poor (2007), London: Constable.  Differences to and criticism of the mainstream economics  Much of The Others Canon's criticism of the mainstream economics regards the focus on equilibrium and the static, as well as what the neoclassical models takes as given (perfect information, perfect foresight, constant returns to scale and no diversity/likeness of economic activity). Conforming with Schumpeterian theory The Other Canon emphasises the constant change in the economy and that entrepreneurs and capitalists all the time create temporary monopolies based on advantages of knowledge and/or uncertain assumptions about the future. The fact that mainstream economics sees innovation and novelty, and hence growth (of which capitalism is absolutely dependent), as exogenous phenomena does not fall lightly with The Other Canon who sees these factors as pivotal to the economy and something that is maximised through stimulation in the form of state policy. The Other Canon claims reintroducing increasing and diminishing (decreasing) returns to scale can help us understand the economic development and why neo-classical economy has failed to explain the uneven development of nations. Reinerts claims poor country's concentrating their production on industries with diminishing returns to scale will lead them to become more inefficient the more they invest while the opposite thing will happen to the rich countries with their primarily increasing returns to scale industries. This, he argues, is why following Ricardian Economics, mainly his theory of comparative advantage, will, instead of leading to the factor price equalisation neo-liberals profess, in fact usher poor countries into \\"specialising in being poor and inefficient\\".Reinert, Erik S. 'Diminishing Returns and Economic Sustainability; The Dilemma of Resource-based Economies under a Free Trade Regime. Paul Krugman, however, takes use of increasing returns to scale in his New Trade Theory to explain the success of the industrialised countries, but leaves out diminishing returns to scale explaining the misery of the Third World. The view of the economy as largely independent from society and the financial sector not being distinct from the real economy are also disputed by The Other Canon claiming that the economy is indeed embedded into society and that conflicts between the financial sector are normal and hence must be regulated.

Incidents and use The naval facility was used during the 1990 Gulf war by the US Armed Forces. A Royal Saudi Air Force C-130 Hercules crashed during approach to the airport during the same war. The plane crashed in the dark and fog at 4:45 a.m. on 21 March 1991. U.S. Marines on guard duty from Battalion Landing Team, 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines noticed a C-130 do a loop then an S-turn looking like it was coming in for a landing. Suddenly, it exploded. The Marine sentries immediately rushed to awaken other Marines and Navy medical personnel in the compound. The C-130 was a Saudi Air Force transport plane flying back to Mishab after taking Senegalese soldiers on a visit to Mecca. The official assessment of the probable cause of the crash was the thick black smoke from hundreds of burning oil wells nearby in Kuwait, which combined with the dark and fog obscured the flight crew's visibility. 92 Senegalese and 6 Saudis died in the crash. Three survivors were pulled from the wreckage by Navy Corpsmen, one of which later succumbed to his injuries. The remaining two were stabilized and transported to hospital. Also the Saudi pilots were not rated for instrument landings, and the control tower personnel had neglected to turn on the inclement weather beacons lining the runway.

Early life and education Brown was born in Fernandina Beach, Florida and moved as a child to Jersey City, New Jersey. He attended the historically black college Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University and earned his law degree at Fordham University School of Law, while working as a longshoreman to cover the costs of tuition. He went into solo practice during a time when few large firms would hire African American attorneys.

H. \\"Butenko and Ivanov Given Long Terms; BUTENKO, IVANOV GET LONG TERMS Russian and American Sentenced\\", The New York Times, December 19, 1964. Accessed October 13, 2009. He defended students who had been arrested for taking part in building takeovers during the Columbia University protests of 1968, including his own son. He was able to get an acquittal for LeRoi Jones (now known as Amiri Baraka), who had been arrested for carrying a concealed weapon during the 1967 Newark riots.Caldwell, Earl. \\"Powell Supporters Begin New Drive; Joins Callender\\", The New York Times, November 6, 1967.

Hughes as vice chair of a commission that investigated the causes, response and possible solutions to the rioting. He represented three members of the Black Panther Party who had been charged with a 1968 machine gunning of a police station in Jersey City, New Jersey. In the case, Brown would subpoena reporters from The New York Times who would testify about their reporting on the case.Staff. \\"2 ON TIMES CALLED IN PANTHERS' CASE; Reporters Subpoenaed in Jersey Machine- Gunning\\", The New York Times, June 20, 1970. Accessed October 13, 2009. Brown would also represent H. Rap Brown, a leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and Black Panther Party.

Brown represented boxer Rubin \\"Hurricane\\" Carter on charges that he and John Artis killed three people in 1966 in Paterson, New Jersey. Carter was convicted in his first trial, but the conviction was overturned in 1975. Brown participated as a witness in Carter's second trial, which again resulted in conviction that was also overturned, with Carter freed by a federal court in 1985 after spending almost two decades in prison. In the late-1970s \\"Dr. X\\" case, Brown successfully defended Dr. Mario Jascalevich, who had been charged with the curare-related deaths of five patients at Riverdell Hospital in Oradell, New Jersey. Brown blamed other doctors at the hospital of framing Jascalevich to cover up their own ineptitude and charged that reporter M. A. Farber of The New York Times had conspired with prosecutors to advance their respective careers by pointing the finger of blame at Jascalevich. After Brown subpoenaed thousands of pages of the reporter's notes from The Times, Farber was held in jail for 40 days on contempt charges by Judge Theodore Trautwein and The Times was fined almost $300,000 for its efforts to protect its sources. In November 1978, the Supreme Court of the United States refused to take the case, citing the fact that neither the United States Constitution or existing state shield laws provide an absolute privilege to refuse to provide information demanded in a criminal case by a defendant.Greenhouse, Linda. \\"HIGH COURT REFUSES FARBER CASE REVIEW; Action Lets Jersey's Ruling Stand on First Amendment Privilege Supreme Court Refuses to Review Press Freedom Case A Delicate Balance Lack of a Hearing Deplored\\", The New York Times, November 28, 1978.

The Flood Control Act of 1944 approved and the Flood Control Act of 1946 authorized development of a reservoir on the creek as part of the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program. Construction of Norton Dam began in December 1961, and the initial storage of water in Norton Reservoir started in October 1964. In March 1958, the nearby community of Norton, Kansas secured a contract with the U.S. government to receive 1,600 acre-feet of water annually. In 1963, the Kansas state government granted the community a water right to that amount of storage in the reservoir. Norton began to use the reservoir as a municipal water supply in September 1965. In 1981, the U.S. Congress renamed the reservoir Keith Sebelius Lake after retiring U.S. Representative and Norton native Keith Sebelius. Geography Keith Sebelius Lake is located at (39.8041721, -99.9320688) at an elevation of . It lies in northwest Kansas in the High Plains region of the Great Plains. The reservoir is located entirely within Norton County. The reservoir is impounded at its northeastern end by Norton Dam. Prairie Dog Creek is both the reservoir's primary inflow from the southwest and its outflow to the northeast. U.S. Route 36 and Kansas Highway 383 run concurrently east-west north of the reservoir. Kansas Highway 261 runs north-south between U.S. 36 and Prairie Dog State Park on the reservoir's north shore. The city of Norton lies northeast of the reservoir. Hydrography The surface area, surface elevation, and water volume of the reservoir fluctuate based on inflow and local climatic conditions. In terms of capacity, the Bureau of Reclamation vertically divides the reservoir into a set of pools based on volume and water level, and it considers the reservoir full when filled to the capacity of its active conservation pool. When full, Keith Sebelius Lake has a surface area of , a surface elevation of , and a volume of . When filled to maximum capacity, it has a surface area of , a surface elevation of , and a volume of . The streambed underlying the reservoir has an elevation of . Since the reservoir's initial flooding, sedimentation has gradually accumulated on the reservoir bottom thus raising its elevation. Infrastructure Norton Dam is a zoned earth-fill embankment dam with rock riprap on its upstream face. It has a structural height of and a length of . At its crest, the dam has an elevation of . A spillway structure controlled by three radial gates is located at the southeast end of the dam. Outlet works at the northwest end of the dam manage outflow into Prairie Dog Creek and the city of Norton's municipal water supply. Management The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation maintains and operates the reservoir and Norton Dam. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers provides water regulation procedures for flood control. Downstream canals and structures which use portions of the reservoir's water for irrigation are managed by Almena Irrigation District No. 5. The Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism (KDWP) manages the surface of the reservoir and of land around it as the Norton Wildlife Area. Parks and recreation The KDWP operates the Prairie Dog State Park on the reservoir's north shore. It includes boat ramps, camping facilities, a hiking trail, and a swimming beach. Keith Sebelius Lake is open for sport fishing year-round. Hunting is permitted on the public land around the reservoir although it is restricted in certain areas. Points of interest The KDWP preserves two vintage 19th-century buildings in Prairie Dog State Park: a one- room schoolhouse and the last standing original adobe house in Kansas. The park also hosts a growing prairie dog town. Wildlife Fish species resident in the reservoir include bluegill, channel catfish, crappie, flathead catfish, largemouth bass, saugeye, spotted bass, walleye, and wiper. Game animals living around the reservoir include mule deer, ducks, quail, cottontail rabbits, turkeys, and white-tailed deer. The reservoir is surrounded almost entirely by shortgrass prairie.

In magnetized objects  In electromagnetism, all magnetizations can be seen as microscopic persistent currents. By definition a magnetization \\\\mathbf{M} can be replaced by its corresponding microscopic form, which is an electric current density: : \\\\mathbf{J_m} = abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{M} This current is a bound current, not having any charge accumulation associated with it since it is divergenceless. What this means is that any permanently magnetized object, for example a piece of lodestone, can be considered to have persistent electric currents running throughout it (the persistent currents are generally concentrated near the surface). The converse is also true: any persistent electric current is divergence-free, and can therefore be represented instead by a magnetization. Therefore, in the macroscopic Maxwell's equations, it is purely a choice of mathematical convenience, whether to represent persistent currents as magnetization or vice versa. In the microscopic formulation of Maxwell's equations, however, \\\\mathbf{M} does not appear and so any magnetizations must be instead represented by bound currents.  In superconductors  In superconductors, charge can flow without any resistance. It is possible to make pieces of superconductor with a large built-in persistent current, either by creating the superconducting state (cooling the material) while charge is flowing through it, or by changing the magnetic field around the superconductor after creating the superconducting state. This principle is used in superconducting electromagnets to generate sustained high magnetic fields that only require a small amount of power to maintain. The persistent current was first identified by H. Kamerlingh Onnes, and attempts to set a lower bound on their duration have reached values of over 100,000 years.File J, Mills, R Physical Review Letters 1963  In resistive conductors  Persistent current schematic. The green arrow indicates the direction of static applied magnetic field B which allows a net current I (blue arrow) to flow and create a magnetization M (black arrow) by breaking the symmetry between clockwise and counterclockwise currents. The yellow dot represents an electron traversing the disordered material of the ring (green stars) without dissipation. A typical ring current is 1 nanoampere for a ring diameter of 0.6 micrometer at a temperature below 0.5 kelvin. Surprisingly, it is also possible to have tiny persistent currents inside resistive metals that are placed in a magnetic field, even in metals that are nominally \\"non-magnetic\\". The current is the result of a quantum mechanical effect that influences how electrons travel through metals, and arises from the same kind of motion that allows the electrons inside an atom to orbit the nucleus forever. This type of persistent current is a mesoscopic low temperature effect: the magnitude of the current becomes appreciable when the size of the metallic system is reduced to the scale of the electron quantum phase coherence length and the thermal length. Persistent currents decrease with increasing temperature and will vanish exponentially above a temperature known as the Thouless temperature. This temperature scales as the inverse of the circuit diameter squared. Consequently, it has been suggested that persistent currents could flow up to room temperature and above in nanometric metal structures such as metal (Au, Ag,...) nanoparticles. This hypothesis has been offered for explaining the singular magnetic properties of nanoparticles made of gold and other metals. Unlike with superconductors, these persistent currents do not appear at zero magnetic field, as the current fluctuates symmetrically between positive and negative values; the magnetic field breaks that symmetry and allows a nonzero average current. Although the persistent current in an individual ring is largely unpredictable due to uncontrolled factors like the disorder configuration, it has a slight bias so that an average persistent current appears even for an ensemble of conductors with different disorder configurations. This kind of persistent current was first predicted to be experimentally observable in micrometer-scale rings in 1983 by Markus B√ºttiker, Yoseph Imry, and Rolf Landauer. Because the effect requires the phase coherence of electrons around the entire ring, the current can not be observed when the ring is interrupted by an ammeter and thus the current must by measured indirectly through its magnetization. In fact, all metals exhibit some magnetization in magnetic fields due a combination of de Haas‚Äìvan Alphen effect, core diamagnetism, Landau diamagnetism, Pauli paramagnetism, which all appear regardless of the shape of the metal. The additional magnetization from persistent current becomes strong with a connected ring shape, and for example would disappear if the ring were cut. Experimental evidence of the observation of persistent currents were first reported in 1990 by a research group at Bell Laboratories using a superconducting resonator to study an array of copper rings. Subsequent measurements using superconducting resonators and extremely sensitive magnetometers known as superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) produced inconsistent results. In 2009, physicists at Stanford University using a scanning SQUID and at Yale University using microelectromechanical cantilevers reported measurements of persistent currents in nanoscale gold and aluminum rings respectively that both showed a strong agreement with the simple theory for non-interacting electrons. The 2009 measurements both reported greater sensitivity to persistent currents than previous measurements and made several other improvements to persistent current detection. The scanning SQUID's ability to change the position of the SQUID detector relative to the ring sample allowed for a number of rings to be measured on one sample chip and better extraction of the current signal from background noise. The cantilever detector's mechanical detection technique made it possible to measure the rings in a clean electromagnetic environment over a large range of magnetic field and also to measure a number of rings on one sample chip.

It is named after British astronomer Alexander Stewart Herschel. Properties The Herschel graph is a planar graph: it can be drawn in the plane with none of its edges crossing. It is also 3-vertex-connected: the removal of any two of its vertices leaves a connected subgraph. It is a bipartite graph: its vertices can be separated into two subsets of five and six vertices respectively, such that every edge has an endpoint in each subset (the red and blue subsets in the picture). As with any bipartite graph, the Herschel graph is a perfect graph : the chromatic number of every induced subgraph equals the size of the largest clique of that subgraph. It has also chromatic index 4, girth 4, radius 3 and diameter 4. Polyhedron Click here for an animated version. The Herschel graph is planar and 3-vertex- connected, so it follows by Steinitz's theorem that it is a polyhedral graph: there exists a convex polyhedron (an enneahedron) having the Herschel graph as its skeleton.. This polyhedron has nine quadrilaterals for faces, which can be chosen to form three rhombi and six kites. Its dual polyhedron is a rectified triangular prism, formed as the convex hull of the midpoints of the edges of a triangular prism. This polyhedron has the property that its faces cannot be numbered in such a way that consecutive numbers appear on adjacent faces, and such that the first and last number are also on adjacent faces. Because polyhedral face numberings of this type are used as \\"spindown life counters\\" in the game Magic: The Gathering, name the canonical polyhedron realization of this dual polyhedron as \\"the Lich's nemesis\\". Hamiltonicity A Hamiltonian path (but not cycle) in the Herschel graph As a bipartite graph that has an odd number of vertices, the Herschel graph does not contain a Hamiltonian cycle (a cycle of edges that passes through each vertex exactly once). For, in any bipartite graph, any cycle must alternate between the vertices on either side of the bipartition, and therefore must contain equal numbers of both types of vertex and must have an even length. Thus, a cycle passing once through each of the eleven vertices cannot exist in the Herschel graph. It is the smallest non-Hamiltonian polyhedral graph, whether the size of the graph is measured in terms of its number of vertices, edges, or faces.. There exist other polyhedral graphs with 11 vertices and no Hamiltonian cycles (notably the Goldner‚ÄìHarary graph.) but none with fewer edges. All but three of the vertices of the Herschel graph have degree three. Tait's conjecture. Reprinted in Scientific Papers, Vol. II, pp. 85‚Äì98. states that a polyhedral graph in which every vertex has degree three must be Hamiltonian, but this was disproved when W. T. Tutte provided a counterexample, the much larger Tutte graph.. A refinement of Tait's conjecture, Barnette's conjecture that every bipartite 3-regular polyhedral graph is Hamiltonian, remains open. Every maximal planar graph that does not have a Hamiltonian cycle has a Herschel graph as a minor. The Herschel graph is conjectured to be one of three minor- minimal non-Hamiltonian 3-vertex-connected graphs. The other two are the complete bipartite graph K_{3,4} and a graph formed by splitting both the Herschel graph and K_{3,4} into two symmetric halves by three-vertex separators and then combining one half from each graph. The medial graph of the Herschel graph is a 4-regular planar graph with no Hamiltonian decomposition. The shaded regions correspond to the vertices of the underlying Herschel graph. The Herschel graph also provides an example of a polyhedral graph for which the medial graph cannot be decomposed into two edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles. The medial graph of the Herschel graph is a 4-regular graph with 18 vertices, one for each edge of the Herschel graph; two vertices are adjacent in the medial graph whenever the corresponding edges of the Herschel graph are consecutive on one of its faces.. It is 4-vertex-connected and essentially 6-edge-connected, meaning that for every partition of the vertices into two subsets of at least two vertices, there are at least six edges crossing the partition. History The Herschel graph is named after British astronomer Alexander Stewart Herschel, who wrote an early paper concerning William Rowan Hamilton's icosian game: the Herschel graph describes the smallest convex polyhedron for which this game has no solution. However, Herschel's paper described solutions for the Icosian game only on the graphs of the regular tetrahedron and regular icosahedron; it did not describe the Herschel graph.. The name \\"the Herschel graph\\" makes an early appearance in a graph theory textbook by John Adrian Bondy and U. S. R. Murty, published in 1976. However, the graph itself was described earlier, for instance by H. S. M. Coxeter.

International Stakes, the grade one Manhattan Handicap, the grade two Turf Classic Stakes, the grade two Dixie Handicap, the grade two Canadian Turf Handicap, the grade three Appleton Handicap and the listed Fort Lauderdale Handicap. He also placed second in the grade two Bernard Baruch Handicap and the group one Japan Cup. In the 1994 $2,000,000 grade one Breeders' Cup Turf, Paradise Creek entered the race as the prohibitive odds-on favorite. Jockey Pat Day had him press the pace from the onset, sitting in a very close stalking position at fourth behind leader Dahlia's Dreamer. At the halfway point in the race, Paradise Creek cleared the field by a head just before the mile mark. Speeding by natural sprinters Raintap and Vaudeville, he continued to lead after a mile and quarter but tired late, holding on to third. Tikkanen moved ahead to win the race by 1 1/2 lengths at odds of almost 17-1.  Retirement  Paradise Creek was sold to a Japanese breeding syndicate in 1995 and stood in Japan that first year. He stood at Arrow Stud in Japan and his 2009 stud fee was ¬•200,000. He died on April 4, 2011 at Arrow Stud. His most notable offspring is the two-year-old filly, TM Precure.

His Chinese name is rendered as Bao Ruowang,Chicago Tribune, 'Jean Pasqualini: Wrote About China Labor Camps', 13 October 1997 with \\"Bao\\" representing the first syllable in Pasqualini and \\"Ruowang\\" being a phonetic rendering of Jean. Biography As a child, Jean Pasqualini attended Academie Lafayette Tianjin and Shanghai. During the Second World War and after, he worked as a translator for the U.S. military and the British Embassy in Beijing prior to the Communist Party takeover in 1949. During the political campaigns of 1957, Pasqualini was sentenced to 12 years in detention and was accused of \\"counter- revolutionary activity\\" on the basis of his work with foreigners. He was released in 1964 after France established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. Following his release, he was expelled and moved to Paris. In 1973, along with co-author Rudolph Chelminski, Pasqualini published his autobiography Prisoner of Mao. The book recounted his experiences as a prisoner from 1957‚Äì1964, including 15 months of interrogation that led to a 700-page confession. Pasqualini recalled the experience of the Great Chinese Famine and of being privately warned by a labor camp doctor not to eat the adulterated food that had been mixed with sawdust. He also detailed at length the daily criticism and self-criticism sessions. Over the course of his imprisonment, Jean Pasqualini wrote that he lost the capacity for independent thought, his defiance and skepticism gradually giving way to acceptance of his own guilt. Pasqualini spent his later years in France working as a translator and researcher for Newsweek and Life magazine. In 1992, he co-founded the Laogai Research Foundation with Harry Wu.Benjamin Ivry, 'Pasqualini, Out of Print', Commentary Magazine, 29 August 2007. He died in a Paris hospital in 1997. Influence Jean Pasqualini's account of life in the labor camp system was a major source for The Black Book of Communism.Coutois, Stephane, S.C. (1999). The Black Book of Communism: Crimes Terror Repression. Cambridge, MA: President and Fellows of Harvard College. His book has been translated into several languages, and was made into a French-language movie in 1977. It has been described as the first autobiographical account of life in China's labor camp system. When Pasqualini's book was initially published, he was criticized and denounced by French supporters of the Communist Revolution who, according to Seth Faison, \\"refused to believe that the seemingly utopian nation of happy peasants and workers ... could have such a dark side.\\" In 1978, Belgian sinologist Pierre Ryckmans described Prisoner of Mao as the \\"most fundamental document on the Maoist ‚ÄòGulag‚Äô and, as such, the most studiously ignored by the lobby that maintains that there is no human-rights problem in the People‚Äôs Republic.\\" Criticism subsided years later as more information emerged to corroborate Pasqualini's account, and Chinese authorities admitted to the excesses of the period.

Scientific career  He graduated from Faculty of Interior Design In Academy of Fine Art in Cracow. His doctoral thesis from 1985 showed groundbreaking approach to methodology of designing process treated as a creative act or even a peak experience rather than simple realization of an idea. Emotional aspect of creating and self-awareness of designer are equally important in this theory based on transpersonal psychology and existentialism. Though the theory was innovative it occurred to be too controversial for its times in Poland. It became a valuable source for curriculum, implemented and developed in The Third Studio of Interior Design since 1994. He was Dean of Faculty of Interior Design from 1990 to 1993. As the first dean after 1989 he began process of reformation in Academy. He focuses on teaching and designing tangible and virtual realities, real spaces and cyberspaces.

Popular Polish and foreign artists: actors, writers, journalists were its frequent guests. Projects from the 1990s represent optimistic design, full of stylistic courage and fun crafts with form. Objects are unconventional and quite unrealistic but they do not lose their functionality. Furniture, lamps and glass projects are the most characteristic. Their finessed shapes and both funny and philosophic names had many admirers in Europe.  Inspirations  Theoretical physics is his great passion and influences his artistic activities.

Taxonomy The family Diplosentidae was established by Tubangui and Masilu√±gan 1937 based on Diplosentis amphacanthi. The family now contains six genera divided into two subfamilies. The family is characterised by the absence of trunk spines, presence of just two cement glands, heavily coiled lemnisci said to be enclosed in a membranous sac and similar hooks on the proboscis.Pichelin, S. & Cribb, T. (2001). The status of the Diplosentidae (Acanthocephala: Palaeacanthocephala) and a new family of acanthocephalans from Australian wrasses (Pisces: Labridae). Folia Parasitologica, 48(4), 289‚Äì303. Golvan, in 1969, placed Pararhadinorhynchus in the Diplosentinae because they had two cement glands and no trunk spines. Golvan also created in 1969 the Allorhadinorhynchinae based on Allorhadinorhynchus for diplosentids with two cement glands and trunk spines. Subsequently Noronha et al. in 1978, added Golvanorhynchus, Amin and Sey in 1996 added Slendrorhynchus and Salgado- Maldonado and Santos added Amapacanthus in 2000 all within the Allorhadinorhynchinae subfamily. However, two these genera (Golvanorhynchus and Slendrorhynchus) has modified the concept of the family to include genera with more than two cement glands. The type species of Allorhadinorhynchus, A. segmentatum was described by Yamaguti in 1959 as having only two cement glands but Araki and Machida in 1987 showed that this species has four cement glands. They proposed the new combination of Micracanthorhynchina segmentata which implies membership of the Rhadinorhynchidae. As a result they synonymised Allorhadinorhynchus with Micracanthorhynchina. This action also had significance for the subfamily Allorhadinorhynchinae which should have fallen into synonymy, however this has not been commented on by any authors. Despite this well argued action, Amin and Sey in 1996 did not recognise the new combination proposed by Araki and Machida in 1987, stating without argumentation that it was ‚Äúinvalid‚Äù. Thus the family has little morphological integrity. Species Arhythmacanthidae has 2 subfamilies (Allorhadinorhynchinae and Diplosentinae) and the following species:https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search;_value=64265#null Allorhadinorhynchinae Golvan, 1969 Allorhadinorhynchus Yamaguti, 1959 * Allorhadinorhynchus segmentatum Yamaguti, 1959 A. segmentatum is the only species and thus the type species of the genus Allorhadinorhynchus.

Migration history As Angola and Namibia are neighbours, there has historically been a great deal of cross-border movements between the two countries. There were formerly large numbers of immigrants from southeast Angola at Mangarangandja and Sarasungu, east of Rundu along the Okavango River; however, they were relocated to Kaisosi and Kehemu in the 1970s. These early migrants tend to identify themselves as \\"Nyemba\\". Many early migrants were of Ovambo ethnicity, an ethnic group found on both sides of the border. In 1989, as Namibia prepared to form a new independent government and Namibians in self-imposed exile in Angola returned to their homeland, hundreds of Angolans, including Angolans of Portuguese descent, came along with them, fleeing renewed fighting in the Angolan Civil War. The number of Angolan refugees had grown to 2,069 by 1996 and to 7,612 by 1999. Roughly 2,300 of those lived at Kahenge in the border area, with another 5,000 at Osire near Otjiwarongo in central Namibia. Efforts that year by the Namibian government to move newly-arriving refugees away from the border area to Osire camps were not well received; new arrivals preferred to remain in areas where they had familial and ethnic ties, despite the danger of attack from Angola and the poor facilities in the camp at Kahenge. At the peak in 2001, statistics of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) showed 30,881 Angolan refugees in the country. Between January and July 2004, 7,035 Angolans who had taken refuge in Namibia during the Angolan Civil War had returned to Angola; the UNHCR aimed to repatriate a total of 14,000 that year. By 2005, the number of Angolan refugees remaining in the country had dropped sharply to 4,666 people. Though even during the period of conflict, the border remained fairly permeable, the return of peace saw an increase in border crossings. Between 1999 and 2003, the number of foreign citizens arriving from Angola at the Oshikango border post nearly doubled from 143,992 to 267,504. The flow of Angolans into Namibia is much larger than the reverse flow of Namibians into Angola. Most cross the border on business or for visiting family members for short-term trips; only about 9% of these border-crossers stay in Namibia longer than six months. Some young labour migrants also cross the border from Angola into Namibia for temporary or seasonal work, especially on Namibian farms.

Single diocese The French possessions of North America were under the authority of a single diocese, whose seat was in Quebec. The archbishop, named and remunerated by the king, was spiritual head of all New France. With loose religious supervision, the fervor of the population was very weak; Louisianans tended to practice their faith much less than their counterparts in France and Canada. The tithe, a tax by the clergy on the faithful, produced less revenue than in France. The Church nevertheless played an important part in the exploration of French Louisiana; it sent missions, primarily carried out by Jesuits, to convert Native Americans. It also founded schools and hospitals: by 1720, the Ursulines were operating a hospital in New Orleans. Contact with American tribes The Church and its missionaries established contact with the Amerindian tribes. Certain missionaries, such as Father Jacques Marquette in the 17th century, took part in exploratory missions. The Jesuits translated collections of prayers into numerous Amerindian languages for the purpose of converting the Native Americans. Sometimes living with the tribes, they could not prevent some syncretism of their practices and beliefs. Sincere and permanent conversions were limited in number; many who received missionary instruction tended to assimilate the Holy Trinity into their belief of \\"spirits\\", or rejected it outright. Religious aims of French expeditions In the late 17th century, French expeditions, which included sovereign, religious and commercial aims, established a foothold on the Mississippi River and Gulf Coast. With its first settlements, France lay claim to a vast region of North America and set out to establish a commercial empire and French nation stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada. Extent of Louisiana territory The French colony of Louisiana originally claimed all the land on both sides of the Mississippi River and north to French territory in Canada. The following present day states were part of the then vast tract of Louisiana: Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Catholic settlement along the Mississippi river Louisiana's French settlements contributed to further exploration and outposts. They were concentrated along the banks of the Mississippi and its major tributaries, from Louisiana to as far north as the region called the Illinois Country, near Peoria, Illinois and present-day St. Louis, Missouri.

The Foundation was established to provide support and encouragement to young adults with an interest in aviation and to help them pursue professional flight instruction leading to certification as a private pilot. Aviation scholarships are awarded on a yearly basis to young adults through an application process. Applications are reviewed by a scholarship committee of Foundation board members and professional pilots. Once an individual is selected as a scholarship recipient, flight training is completed at a Cessna Pilot Center. In 2009, the Foundation awarded 11 scholarships to students from all over the United States. The foundation is also introduces aviation careers to children, with an emphasis on reaching disadvantaged youth, as both women and minorities are underrepresented in the field of aviation. The foundation‚Äôs aviation awareness programs are presented to area elementary schools and youth groups, utilizing tools such as Catavia Kids Black Box Program.  Goals  Since September 11th, there has been a steady decline in the number of pilots in the industry.

First introduced in the 9th century, Faroese sheep have long been an integral part of the island traditions. The name Faeroe itself is thought to mean \\"sheep islands\\", and the animal is depicted on the Faroe Islands' historic coat of arms. One of the Northern European short-tailed sheep, it is a small, very hardy breed. Faroes ewes weigh around at maturity, and rams are . Rams are horned and ewes are usually polled, and the breed occurs naturally in many different colours, with at least 300 different combinations with each their own unique name. Faroese sheep tend to have very little flocking instinct due to no natural predators, and will range freely year round in small groups in pastureland, which ranges from meadows, to rugged rocky mountaintops and lush bird-cliffs. They are most closely related to the Norwegian Sp√¶lsau and Icelandic sheep. Ears are usually cut with various simple designs, to denote ownership and what pastures the sheep belong on. There are 54 different official cuts, which can be paired in a vast variety of ways; it is not permitted to use the same combination twice on the same island. The first known law regarding earmarks is in the Sheep letter from 1298, where it is stated among other things in the fifth section: The agricultural policies of the Faroe Islands, have over the centuries divided the pasture into 463 different land lots, with a value measured in mark, and between 40 and 48 ewes going on each mark has resulted in the total prescribed number of ewes that the land can support, being 70.384. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Scottish sheep were imported, mostly in order to produce better wool. This has resulted in some Faroese sheep being of a mixed breed; the majority are still pure. Stamp FR 36 of the Faroe Islands issued on 19 March 1979 Sumba in the background  Economic value and traditional usage  Traditionally, wool and wool products have been the leading economic factor for the Faroese households. A considerable number of knitted sweaters were exported with standing orders to the Danish army, specially during the Napoleonic wars, when several thousand sweaters were exported yearly. Wool socks, and measures of wadmal were used during the 1600s as some of various products taxes were permitted to be payable with. The Royal Danish monopoly received 100,000 home made sweaters and 14,000 pairs of socks in 1849, at a time when only 8,000 people lived on the archipelago. Stortinget (The Norwegian parliament) in Norway made a decree in 1898 that all Norwegian infantry should wear Faroese sweaters under their uniforms in winter time. The meat would be consumed locally over the winter. \\"Ull er F√∏roya gull\\", meaning \\"wool is Faroese gold\\", is a saying which hails from this time and is sometimes heard in modern times when it is lamented how little value the wool has today. The wool is still used but at a much reduced rate compared to its historic use, with much of the wool being burnt, or in some cases sheep are left unsheared to molt naturally on their own; this is however frowned upon by many. There are a few spinning companies around the islands producing yarn, mostly for domestic use and for the tourist industry. Sweaters, socks and shawls are the most popular items. There have been some attempts to kick start a fashion industry based on Faroese wool, with Gu√∞run & Gu√∞run being the most successful. The time of year the sheep will start shedding their wool, is heavily determined by the weather. A good warm spring, with good growth may trigger the shedding as early as late May, whereas a long cold and wet spring and summer, might not trigger the shedding until late July or in a few instances early August. If the sheep are gathered for shearing at a prime moment, then the fleece will easily part from the body by only sliding a hand betwixt the old and new fleece layers. The shorn fleece consists of two layers, the inner layer being fine, lanolin rich wool, perfect for underwear and other fine garments. The outer layer made up of coarse long hairs, traditionally used for heavy duty clothing, such as thick sweaters for fishermen, or even some early arctic explorers. Today, the breed is mainly kept for its meat, with a wide variety of local dishes being favoured heavily over foreign inspired culinary art. Skerpikj√∏t, air dried meat; and r√¶st kj√∏t, meat which has dried and has become fermented, are the most popular, with fresh meat valued somewhat less. B√∫na√∞arstovan (Office for Agriculture) has calculated that locally produced mutton and lamb has an estimated value of 35 million Dkk yearly. Offal is still consumed by many, but it has been considerably losing support among the younger generations in recent years. Every autumn, B√∫na√∞arstovan(Office for Agriculture) has showings where rams and young potential breeding males are on show. These take place out in the various districts and villages.

This Ozark Mountain refuge, which includes a limestone-solution cave, is located west of Fayetteville, Arkansas and approximately north of U.S. Highway #412. The Logan Cave area has a very diverse habitat which includes representatives of several Ozark Mountain types: oak-hickory forest, grassland, shrubland, floodplain, marshland, bottomland hardwood, upland deciduous, and a small prairie. The ecology of the cave has been described as the highest quality cave habitat in the entire Ozark region. A spring-fed stream, with an average water flow of 5 million gallons/day, extends the entire length of the cave. This stream, fed by small springs that emanate from the cave, once supplied water to the Logan community, a fish hatchery and 49 fish ponds. Today, the spring forms a small stream which flows into the Osage Creek, a major tributary of the Illinois River. Geological features of the cave distinctly exhibit how Ozark limestone-solution caves are formed. Many fossil marine species are present in the cave, evidence that the region was once covered by an ocean. Extensive deposits of fine alluvial clays of homogenous texture border the stream in some areas. The primary objectives of Logan Cave NWR are to properly administer, preserve, and develop the tract for protection of a unique cave ecosystem that provides essential habitat for the endangered gray bat, endangered Benton cave crayfish, the threatened Ozark cavefish, and other significant cave dwelling wildlife species. Gray bats use the cave in the spring and summer as a maternity site and the Ozark cave crayfish is known only to exist in Logan Cave and one other site.

It is primarily an upland forest dominated by loblolly pine on the ridges with hardwoods found along the creek bottoms and in scattered upland coves. Clear streams and beaver ponds provide ideal wetland habitat for wood ducks and other wetland dependent species. In the early 19th century the European settlers arrived in abundance and began to clear the land to plant a variety of crops. The settlers removed more than 90% of the forest. The continuous planting of cotton caused serious erosion and soil infertility. By the late 1870s they had abandoned more than a third of the land because the land could not sustain crops. With the combination of soil infertility, the boll weevil outbreak on remaining cotton and the Great Depression, there was wholesale abandonment of the barren eroded land in the 1930s. By then all the top soil had washed away, leaving the red clay subsoil exposed. The refuge was established from this worn out abandoned farm land where few wildlife species remained. With good soil and forest conservation practices, the wildlife habitat began to improve. Today, through the efforts of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, the refuge is once again a forest. The red-cockaded woodpecker, a native bird of the southern US, is an endangered species because the older age pine forests it requires for nesting and roosting have been cleared throughout most of its range. The refuge currently has 50 active family groups. Prescribed burning and thinning are two forest management practices used to provide habitat for the red-cockaded woodpecker. Many migratory bird species, white-tailed deer, wild turkey, and other native wildlife benefit from these management practices. The diversity of habitats provides a haven for over 200 species of birds, including many species of neotropical songbirds, and 50 species of mammals.

King, Publisher, Univ. of Tennessee Press, 2012, The situation of the Catholic Church in the Thirteen Colonies was characterized by an extensive religious persecution originating from Protestant sects, which would barely allow religious toleration to Catholics living on American territory. Origins of anti-Catholicism American Anti-Catholicism has its origins in the Reformation. British colonists, who were predominantly Protestant, opposed not only the Catholic Church but also the Church of England, which they believed perpetuated some Catholic doctrine and practices, and for that reason deemed it to be insufficiently Reformed. Protestants discontented with the Church of England formed the earliest religious settlements in North America. Monsignor John Tracy Ellis wrote that a \\"universal anti-Catholic bias was brought to Jamestown in 1607 and vigorously cultivated in all the thirteen colonies from Massachusetts to Georgia.\\" Some colonies supported an established church, which received tax support from the colonial legislature. Colonies Virginia Eighty-one years before the coming of the English to Jamestown in 1607, a settlement was made in Virginia by Spaniards from San Domingo, under the leadership of Lucas V√°zquez de Ayll√≥n. Accompanied by the Dominican Fathers Antonio de Montesinos and Antonio de Cervantes with Brother Peter de Estrada, the expedition set sail in three vessels from Puerto de la Plata, in June 1526. The severity of the winter, the rebellion of the settlers, and the hostility of the natives caused the abandonment of the settlement in the spring of 1527. In 1624 Virginia was made a crown colony. Because of the establishment of the English Church, hostility was shown to adherents of other beliefs and to Catholics in particular. Lord Baltimore attempted in vain to plant a Catholic colony in Virginia (1629‚Äì30). Stringent legislation was enacted against Catholics. In 1641 a decree declared that adherents of the pope were to be fined 1000 pounds of tobacco if they attempted to hold office. The following year all priests were given five days within which to leave the colony. In 1661 all persons were obliged to attend the Established services or pay a fine of ¬£20. The governor issued orders to magistrates, sheriffs, constables, and people to be diligent in the apprehension and bringing to justice of all Catholic priests. The records of Norfolk County (1687) show Fathers Edmonds and Raymond arrested. In 1699 Catholics were deprived of their right of voting, and later a fine of 500 pounds of tobacco was imposed upon violators of the law. They were declared incompetent as witnesses in 1705, and in 1753 such incompetency was made to cover all cases. Massachusetts Massachusetts was first settled by English religious dissenters. Quakers, Jews, and Catholics were not permitted in the colony. Catholics avoided Massachusetts during the colonial period after laws passed in 1647 and 1700 forbade Catholic priests to reside in the colony under pain of imprisonment and execution. Because many of the British colonists, such as the Puritans and Congregationalists, were fleeing religious persecution by the Church of England, much of early American religious culture exhibited the anti-Catholic bias of these Protestant denominations. Near the close of the reign of Charles I (d. 1649), the forced emigration of the Irish brought many to Massachusetts. However, their number is hard to estimate because the law obliged all Irishmen in certain towns of Ireland to take English surnames‚Äîthe names of some small town, of a color, of a particular trade or office, or of a certain art or craft. New Hampshire Abenaki natives, converted by Jesuit missionaries from Quebec, were the first Catholics of New Hampshire.Broderick,F.L., Paradis, W.H., Staub, C.S., \\"New Hampshire, Catholic Church in\\", New Catholic Encyclopedia, 2003 Originally settled by Anglicans, in 1641 New Hampshire came under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts. Few Catholics appear among the early settlers, as they were banned by the charter of the Plymouth Council, which excluded from New England all who had not taken the Oath of Supremacy. Catholics were denied the right of freemen under the Royal Commission of 1679, which required the Oath of Supremacy, and this was endorsed by the General Assembly held at Portsmouth the following year; and in 1696 a test oath was imposed on the people under pain of fine or imprisonment. The proscription of Catholics continued under the state constitution even after the adoption of the federal constitution. Maryland Catholicism was introduced to the English colonies in 1634 with the founding of the Province of Maryland by Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, based on a charter granted to his father George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore. The first settlers were accompanied by two Jesuit missionaries travelling as gentlemen adventurers. However, the 1646 defeat of the Royalists in the English Civil War led to stringent laws against Catholic education and the extradition of known Jesuits from the colony, including Andrew White, and the destruction of their school at Calverton Manor. During the greater part of the Maryland colonial period, Jesuits continued to conduct Catholic schools clandestinely from their manor house in Newtowne. After Virginia established Anglicanism as mandatory in the colony, many Puritans migrated from Virginia to Maryland. The government gave them land for a settlement called Providence (now called Annapolis). In 1650, the Puritans revolted against the proprietary government and set up a new government that outlawed both Catholicism and Anglicanism. In March 1655, the 2nd Lord Baltimore sent an army under Governor William Stone to put down this revolt. Near Annapolis, his Catholic army was decisively defeated by a Puritan army in what was to be known as the \\"Battle of the Severn\\". The Puritan revolt lasted until 1658, when the Calvert family regained control and re-enacted the Toleration Act. Connecticut The first English settlement was established on the Connecticut River at Windsor by traders from the Plymouth Colony in 1633. In the same year the Dutch from New Amsterdam had sailed up the river and erected a trading house and fort where the city of Hartford now stands, a few miles below Windsor. The Dutch soon after withdrew, leaving the English to establish the first permanent settlements within the boundaries of Connecticut. In 1664 the New Haven Colony, then comprising the various settlements along the coast, was forced to unite with those in the Connecticut valley, thus forming one commonwealth thereafter known as Connecticut. The vast majority of the population remained distinctively English of Puritan origin. Congregationalism was the established religion supported by public taxation. Rhode Island The earliest settlers in Rhode Island were led by Roger Williams and other refugees from Massachusetts. Rhode Island was the first colony to declare freedom of religion for all faiths, including all denominations of Christianity, in 1636. In 1739 there were thirty-three churches in the colony; twelve Baptist, ten Quaker, six Congregational or Presbyterian, and five Episcopalian. It is said that in 1680 there was not one Catholic in the colony, and for a long period their number must have been small. Delaware The area of Delaware was first settled by Swedish colonists under the leadership of Peter Minuit, former governor of New Amsterdam. In 1655 the Swedish settlements surrendered to the Dutch, who in 1664 surrendered to the English. From its earliest settlement, at no time did religious intolerance ever appear in the government of the Swedish colony which grew into the State of Delaware. Prior to 1772 no definite records are obtainable regarding any regularly established Catholic church in the present State of Delaware. The Catholics in the State prior to the latter part of the eighteenth century were very few in number. In 1730 Cornelius Hallahan, an Irish Catholic settled in Mill Creek Hundred in New Castle Country on an estate called by him Cuba Rock, near the present location of Mount Cuba, Delaware. The first Catholic services in the State were probably held at his house. The Apoquiniminck Mission, in the lower part of New Castle Country, was established before 1750 by Jesuits from St. Xavier's Mission in Cecil County, Maryland. In a 1748 report from the Episcopal Mission at Dover (Kent Country) to the clergymen of the Pennsylvania province, it is stated that the \\"Quakers and Roman Catholics were long accustomed to bury their dead at their own plantations.\\" Again in 1751 a like report from the Dover Mission states: \\"There are about five or six families of Papists, who are attended once a month from Maryland with a priest.\\" In January 1772, Father Matthew Sittensperger, a Jesuit known under the name of Manners, purchased a farm in Mill Creek Hundred which was known as Coffee Run, and here a log chapel called St. Mary's and a residence were erected. Father Sittensperger was succeeded by the Rev. Stephen Faure who, with other Frenchmen, was driven from St. Domingo by slave uprisings and settled at Wilmington. In 1785 Delaware was one of the four states (the others being Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia) where Catholics were not virtually under civil disabilities. North Carolina In 1663 Charles II, of Catholic sympathies, granted to Sir George Carteret and seven others a stretch of land on the Atlantic coast, lying between Virginia and Florida. The grantees were created \\"absolute lords proprietors\\" of the province of Carolina, with full powers to make and execute such laws as they deemed proper. In 1674 the population was about four thousand. After 1729 Carolina became a royal province, the king having purchased from the proprietors seven-eighths of their domain. Under the lords proprietors, there was much religious discrimination and even persecution; but there was little under the Crown except as to holding office. The disqualification for office involved in denying the truth of the Protestant religion remained in the Constitution until the Convention of 1835. New York The Dutch Colony of the seventeenth century was officially intolerantly Protestant but was in practice tolerant and fair to people of other faiths who dwelt within New Netherland. When the English took the province from the Dutch in 1664, they granted full religious toleration to the other forms of Protestantism, and preserved the property rights of the Dutch Reformed Church, while recognizing its discipline. The General Assembly of the province held in 1682 under the famous Governor Thomas Dongan, an Irish Catholic nobleman, adopted the Charter of Liberties, which proclaimed religious liberty to all Christians, although this charter did not receive formal royal sanction. In 1688 the Stuart Revolution in England reversed this policy of liberality, and the Province of New York immediately followed the example of the mother-country in intolerance and legal persecution of the Catholic Church and its adherents. In 1697, although the Anglican Church was never formally established in the Province of New York, Trinity Church was founded in the City of New York by royal charter and received many civil privileges and munificent grants of land. The Dutch Reformed Churches continued, however, to enjoy their property and the protection of their rights undisturbed by the new Anglican foundation, the inhabitants of Dutch blood being then largely in the ascendant. This condition continued many years, for when the Revolution occurred in 1776 the majority of the inhabitants of the Province of New York were not of English descent. The political conditions at home, and also the long contest between England and France for the control of North America, resulted in the enactment by the provincial legislature from time to time of proscriptive laws against the Catholics. Catholic priests and teachers were ordered to keep away from the province or, if they by any chance came there, to depart at once. Severe penalties were provided for disobedience to these laws extending to long imprisonment. In the disturbances and panic of the Slave Insurrection of 1741 schoolmaster John Ury was tried and executed for his alleged role in the uprising. New Jersey New Jersey was founded as a proprietary colony by grant to Lord John Berkeley and Sir George Carteret, who attracted settlers not only from England but from Scotland, New England, and particularly from Long Island and Connecticut. These planters were largely Calvinists from Presbyterian and Congregational communities, and occupied mainly land in Newark, Elizabeth, and upon the north shore of Monmouth County. The Calvinists brought with them into East Jersey their distinctive views upon religious and civil matters. East Jersey resembled New England in civil government; West Jersey resembled Virginia. The comparative liberality of the proprietary rule of Berkeley and Carteret, especially in religious matters, attracted some Catholic settlers to New Jersey. As early as 1672 Fathers Harvey and Gage visited both Woodbridge and Elizabethtown (then the capital of New Jersey) for the purpose of ministering to the Catholics in those places. Robert Vanquellen, a native of Caen, France, and a Catholic, lived at Woodbridge, and was surveyor general of that section of New Jersey in 1669 and 1670. Catholics were, however, regarded with some suspicion, and considerable bigotry at times manifested itself. A Catholic by the name of William Douglass, when elected a representative from Bergen County, was excluded from the General Assembly of 1668 because of his religious convictions. In 1691 the New York Assembly passed the first anti-Catholic enactment, which was followed by laws strongly opposed to Catholics and their beliefs both in New York and New Jersey. Lord Cornbury, when appointed governor in 1701, was instructed by Queen Anne to permit liberty of conscience to all persons except \\"papists\\". South Carolina In 1670 the foundation of South Carolina was laid in a settlement on the Ashley River and a governor was appointed. In 1673 Charleston was fixed as the permanent site for the settlement, a number of Dutch immigrants from New York having arrived the year before. The colony was further augmented by Presbyterian Scotch-Irish in 1683, but the most important addition was the coming of the French Huguenots upon the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, who settled on the Cooper River, and were later admitted to the political rights of the colony. In 1697 religious liberty was accorded to all \\"except Papists\\". An attempt was made in 1704 to exclude Dissenters from the Assembly, but the law was annulled by Queen Anne. The Crown assumed control in 1721. Pennsylvania Pennsylvania was established in 1681 by a grant of 40,000 square miles to William Penn for services rendered to the crown by his father, Admiral Penn. Penn, a devout member of the Society of Friends, was impelled by desire to provide a safe home for persecuted Quakers. Penn was far in advance of his time in his views of the capacity of mankind for democratic government, and equally so in his broad-minded toleration of differences of religious belief. Penn's Quaker beliefs helped an attitude of toleration toward all Christian denominations spread among the population of Pennsylvania and into the colony's laws. The first Constitution of Pennsylvania adopted by the freeholders established religious liberty, but was not accepted by the Privy Council. The Frame of Government of 1701 guaranteed liberty of conscience to all who confessed and acknowledged \\"one Almighty God\\", and made eligible for office all who believed in \\"Jesus Christ the Savior of the World.\\" Georgia James Oglethorpe, who had followed up a brilliant military career as aide-de-camp to Prince Eugene by a still more brilliant parliamentary career, had conceived the plan of settling a colony in the New World with worthy, though unfortunate and economically unproductive, inmates of the wretched English prisons. According to the colony's by-laws, freedom of worship was to be granted to all prospective colonists \\"except papists\\". In royal colonies such as Georgia, citizens were expected to belong to the Anglican Church. Examples of religious toleration Rhode Island, under the leadership of Roger Williams allowed freedom of religion for all faiths upon its founding. Maryland was an example of religious toleration in a fairly intolerant age. The Act of Toleration, issued in 1649, was one of the first laws that explicitly defined tolerance of varieties of religion. It has been considered a precursor to the First Amendment. Few Catholics In 1700 Maryland recorded fewer than 3,000 Catholics out of a population of 34,000 (around 9% of the population). In 1757, Pennsylvania recorded fewer than 1,400 Catholics out of a population of about 200,000. In 1790, when the newly founded United States (formerly the Thirteen Colonies) counted almost four million people in the first national census, there were fewer than 65,000 Catholics (about 1.6% of the population). John Carroll, first Catholic bishop assigned to the United States, in 1785 estimated the number of Catholics at 25,000; 15,800 in Maryland, 7,000 in Pennsylvania and 1,500 in New York. There were only 25 priests. Vicar Apostolic of the London District Until the end of the Continental Congress or Congress of the Confederation in 1789, Catholics were under a titular bishop of the Catholic Church in England and Wales or Vicar Apostolic of the London District whose jurisdiction included the Catholics of British (English speaking) possessions in America. The last British Catholic bishops to oversee the Catholics of the newly formed United States were Richard Challoner, 1758‚Äì81, and James Robert Talbot, 1781-90. Talbot was succeeded by the American, John Carroll, who became the first American-born bishop.

Surrounded by mountains, it lies in Bear Lake Valley at an elevation ranging from on the marsh to on the rocky slopes of Merkley Mountain. The refuge office is located in Montpelier. The refuge is mainly made up of a bulrush marsh, open water, and flooded meadows of sedges, rushes, and grasses. Portions of the refuge include scattered grasslands and brush-covered slopes. Bear Lake Refuge encompasses what is locally referred to as Dingle Swamp or Dingle Marsh. Along with Bear Lake proper, the marsh was once part of a larger prehistoric lake that filled the valley. As it drained and receded, Dingle Marsh was reduced from to less than 17,000 before it became part of the refuge. Fauna White-faced ibis, sandhill cranes, swans, ducks, geese, and shorebirds reside in this wildlife refuge during its summer seasons. Moose can sometimes be found on this refuge, along with wintering mule deer. Smaller mammals often seen are muskrats, skunks, and cottontail rabbits.

Experimental methods. In: Paul LE, Atiemo-Obeng AV, Kresta MS, editors. Handbook of Industrial Mixing. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (Chapter 4) The conductivity method requires a conductivity probe to present in the target system, which make it an intrusive method because the existence of the probe might change the mixing efficiency of the mixing device. Discoloration method does not require any probe which makes it a non-intrusive method. However, the color detection device (sometimes the human eye) needs to be calibrated against the conductivity method. Both methods are usually applied to monitor the concentration of the tracer in the most difficult to mix locations such as the area adjacent to the impeller shaft. The benefit of numerical modeling is that once the modeling is completed, the blend time of any predetermined level of homogeneity of any location within the mixing system can be predicted, which is impossible to accomplish by experimental methods. However, numerical modeling needs to be validated by experimental methods.

Versant features vocalist Carah Faye Charnow, of the band Shiny Toy Guns, guitarist/keyboardist Daniel Johansson, drummer Richard Ankers, formerly of the band Melody Club, Johan Grettve, and bassist Nicholas Oja. Recently, Versant has announced their relocation from Sweden to California to work on an album. History After she was released from Shiny Toy Guns in the summer of 2008, Carah Faye Charnow and Daniel Johansson, who produced the title track of The Sounds' album Crossing the Rubicon, formed Versant. Together they searched out bandmates Richard Ankers (no longer a member), Johan Grettve (no longer a member), and Nicholas Oja to complete the line-up. In 2009, Versant released two demos on their MySpace page; \\"Push Away\\" and \\"Out of Touch\\". On February 14, 2009, Versant released a special Valentine's Day video for their fans on Vimeo. The instrumental track in the background appears to be the \\"roots\\" of the demo \\"Quick Escapes\\", which leaked online in November 2009 but has since been removed. \\"Quick Escapes\\" was eventually released as the band's debut single. In the Fall of 2009, Versant posted a cover contest on their MySpace page. They accepted song submissions from their fans and held a vote for the song that they should perform. On October 9, 2009, Versant released a live video of them performing S.O.S. by the Swedish band ABBA on YouTube as their contest winner. Versant played their first two shows in Sweden in November 2009. Versant's debut EP Heartbeats was digitally self-released on September 21, 2010. The track listing is: 1) \\"Heartbeats\\" 2) \\"Push Away\\" 3) \\"Quick Escapes\\" 4) \\"Out of Touch\\". On October 21, 2010, Versant released \\"Quick Escapes\\" as their debut single. On September 24, 2010, the band began selling a limited edition autographed CD version of their EP from their website store. This version was limited to 250 copies, each of which were numbered and autographed by Carah and Daniel. These copies were quick to sell out. The regular (unsigned) CD version of the EP went on sale on November 23, 2010 from their website store. In early 2011 Carah Faye and Daniel Johansson joined Shiny Toy Guns in time for their third album, III, released in October 2012. Faye and Johansson were separated before the album III came out, and Daniel went back to Sweden to work on new music. Chatting with Carah Faye on March 6th, 2013 after the Shiny Toy Guns show in Omaha, Nebraska, U.S.A., she confirmed that she has no desire to work on new music for Versant because of her breakup with Johansson.

Only during the 20th century did this fully succeed, with the election of John F. Kennedy to the presidency in 1960. Immigration During the 19th century, a wave of immigrants from Ireland, Germany, Italy, Eastern Europe and elsewhere swelled the number of Roman Catholics. Substantial numbers of Catholics also came from French Canada during the mid-19th century and settled in New England. This influx would eventually bring increased political power for the Roman Catholic Church and a greater cultural presence, led at the same time to a growing fear of the Catholic \\"menace.\\" Between 1820 and 1860, the Irish constituted over one third of all immigrants to the United States. In the 1840s, they comprised nearly half of all immigrants to this nation. American Catholics were not exactly happy to see the new immigrants. Not only did the exponential growth set off nativist alarms among Protestants, they presented problems for the existing Catholic parishes. The wave of immigration from Ireland led to tension between the Irish and the French-dominated American Catholic Church. French Catholics were contemptuous of the Irish. Later this dynamic would be repeated in the post-Civil War period with the Irish in positions of power, and the new immigrants coming from places such as Naples and Sicily. These new immigrants shared little in common with their Irish Catholic co-religionists other than their faith. Many Catholics stopped practicing their religion or became Protestants. However there were about 700,000 converts to Catholicism from 1813 to 1893. Archdiocese of Baltimore Because of Maryland having been one of the few regions of the colonial United States that was predominantly Catholic, diocese of Baltimore achieved a pre-eminence over the other dioceses in the U.S. It was established as a diocese on November 6, 1789, and was established an Archdiocese on April 8, 1808. In 1858, the Sacred Congregation of the Propaganda, with the approval of Pius IX \\"Prerogative of Place\\" was conferred on the Archdiocese of Baltimore. This decree gave the Archbishop of Baltimore precedence over all the Archbishops of the United States (but not Cardinals) in councils, gatherings, and meetings of whatever kind of the Hierarchy (in conciliis, coetibus et comitiis quibuscumque) regardless of the seniority of other Archbishops in promotion or ordination. Dominance of Irish American Catholics James Gibbons (1834-1921), cardinal archbishop of Baltimore, was the widely respected leader of American Catholics Beginning in the 1840s, although outnumbered by the German American Catholics, Irish American Catholics comprised most of the bishops and controlled most of the Catholic colleges and seminaries in the United States. Parochial schools Catholic schools began in the United States as a reaction against a growing publicly funded school system that was essentially Protestant. In 1839 and 1840, the American Bible Society pledged that \\"the Bible would be read in every classroom in the nation\\". In what was then a predominantly Protestant country, this was generally understood to be the King James Version of the Scriptures. In 1875, President Grant called for a Constitutional amendment that would mandate free public schools and prohibit the use of public funds for \\"sectarian\\" schools. Grant‚Äôs motivation was rooted in his fear of a future with \\"patriotism and intelligence on one side and superstition, ambition and greed on the other\\" which he identified with the Catholic Church. Grant called for public schools that would be \\"unmixed with atheistic, pagan or sectarian teaching.\\" Senator James G. Blaine of Maine had proposed such an amendment to the Constitution in 1874. The amendment was defeated in 1875 but would be used as a model for so-called \\"Blaine Amendments\\" incorporated into 34 state constitutions over the next three decades. These amendments prohibited the use of public funds to fund parochial schools and are still in effect today although a 2002 Supreme Court ruling partially vitiated these amendments. As of March 2009, no state school system had changed its laws to allow state funds to be used for this purpose. Plenary Councils of Baltimore In the latter half of the 19th century, the first attempt at standardizing discipline in the American Church occurred with the convocation of the Plenary Councils of Baltimore. Slavery debate Two slaveholding states, Maryland and Louisiana, had large contingents of Catholic residents. Archbishop of Baltimore, John Carroll, had two black servants - one free and one a slave. The Society of Jesus owned a large number of slaves who worked on the community's farms. Realizing that their properties were more profitable if rented out to tenant farmers rather that worked by slaves, the Jesuits began selling off their slaves in 1837. In 1839, Pope Gregory XVI issued a Bull, entitled In Supremo. Its main focus was against slave trading, but it also clearly condemned racial slavery: :We, by apostolic authority, warn and strongly exhort in the Lord faithful Christians of every condition that no one in the future dare bother unjustly, despoil of their possessions, or reduce to slavery Indians, Blacks or other such peoples. However, the American church continued in deeds, if not in public discourse, to support slaveholding interests. Some American bishops misinterpreted In Supremo as condemning only the slave trade and not slavery itself. Bishop John England of Charleston actually wrote several letters to the Secretary of State under President Van Buren explaining that the Pope, in In Supremo, did not condemn slavery but only the slave trade. One outspoken critic of slavery was Archbishop John Baptist Purcell of Cincinnati, Ohio. In an 1863 Catholic Telegraph editorial Purcell wrote: :\\"When the slave power predominates, religion is nominal. There is no life in it. It is the hard-working laboring man who builds the church, the school house, the orphan asylum, not the slaveholder, as a general rule. Religion flourishes in a slave state only in proportion to its intimacy with a free state, or as it is adjacent to it.\\" During the war, American bishops continued to allow slave-owners to take communion. During the Civil War, Pope Pius IX made no secret of his affinity for the Confederacy, and the American hierarchy was so fearful of local schisms that the bishops were reluctant to speak out on behalf of abolition. African-American Catholics Because the ante-bellum South was predominantly Protestant, most African-Americans who adopted Christianity became Protestant. However, there have been African- American Catholics since colonial times. Irish, Italian and Eastern European Catholics and their clergy often excluded blacks from local parishes. Many blacks simply felt more at home in their birthright Protestant churches, where adaptable liturgies and ministerial opportunities meant that black Christians could worship their own way more readily than in Latin-rite Catholicism. Opposition to educating the slaves in the South was so intense that many religious orders shied away from the task for fear of alienating white patronage. Feuds between religious orders and non-Catholics often forced black Americans out of the schools. Southern bishops repeatedly tried to muster the funds and workforce and funds to render an effective ministry to African Americans, but their extreme poverty crippled most of the efforts they made. As a result of this discrimination, African-American Catholics operated largely as segregated enclaves. They also founded separate religious orders for black nuns and priests since diocesan seminaries would not accept them. For example, they formed two separate communities of black nuns: the Oblate Sisters of Providence in 1829 and the Holy Family Sisters in 1842. While there had been African-American Catholics since colonial times, historically only white priests tended to their spiritual and corporal needs. Although the Vatican promoted the importance of African-American priests, the American hierarchy, exhibiting commonly accepted racial attitudes, considered African- Americans poor prospects for the priesthood. These attitudes forced the first African-American priests to pursue their formational studies and ordination outside of the United States. James Augustine Healy, a light-skinned son of an African-American mother and Irish-immigrant father, was ordained in 1854 in Paris, France. Father Healy eventually became the second bishop of the Diocese of Portland, Maine in 1875. His brother, Patrick Francis Healy, joined the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) in Liege, France in 1864 and became the president of Georgetown University ten years later. In 1886, Augustus Tolton, a former slave, was ordained a priest in Rome and returned to the United States to minister to the needs of African-American Catholics in the Midwest. It was not until 1891 that Charles Uncles became the first African-American priest to be ordained in the United States. In 1866, Archbishop Martin J. Spalding of Baltimore convened the Second Plenary Council of Baltimore, partially in response to the growing need for religious care for former slaves. Attending bishops remain divided over the issue of separate parishes for African- American Catholics. In 1889, Daniel Rudd, a former slave and Ohio journalist, organized the National Black Catholic Congress, the first national organization for African-American Catholic lay men. The Congress met in Washington, D.C. and discussed issues such as education, job training, and \\"the need for family virtues.\\" Third Plenary Council of Baltimore One result of the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore was the development of the Baltimore Catechism which became the standard text for Catholic education in the United States and remained so until the 1960s when Catholic churches and schools began moving away from catechism-based education. Another result of this council was the establishment of The Catholic University of America, the national Catholic university in the United States. Labor union movement The Catholic Church exercised a prominent role in shaping America's labor movement. From the onset of significant immigration in the 1840s, the Church in the United States was predominantly urban, with both its leaders and congregants usually of the laboring classes. Over the course of the second half of the 19th century, nativism, anti-Catholicism, and anti-unionism coalesced in Republican politics, and Catholics gravitated toward unions and the Democratic Party. Americanism The Whitemarsh Constitutions in 1784 called for congregational election of pastors and lay control of parochial finances. Bishop John England in Charleston set up a Diocesan Constitution calling for popularly elected delegates in the dioceses. By the 1830s, however, the bishops had regained full control and ended advisory councils of laymen. Progressive Catholics in America advocated greater Catholic involvement in American culture, which some understood to mean that Roman Catholics should adapt its teachings to modern civilization. This was too close to the liberalism condemned by the pope. Rumors spread among Europeans that an \\"Americanist\\" movement was sweeping the Catholic churches in the United States and would allegedly soon lead to the American Church claiming independence for itself. Americanism was considered a serious heresy by the Vatican, meant Catholic endorsement of the policy of separation of church and state. Rome feared that such a heresy was held by Irish Catholic leaders in the United States, such as Isaac Hecker, and bishops John Keane, John Ireland, and John Lancaster Spalding, as well as the magazines Catholic World and Ave Marie. The true Catholic belief supposedly was close support of the Catholic Church by a government. Allegations were made by German American Catholic bishops in the Midwest, who are distrustful of the Irish to increasingly dominated the American Catholic Church.. The Vatican grew alarmed in the 1890s, and Pope Leo XIII issued an encyclical denouncing Americanism in theory. In Longinqua oceani (1895; ‚ÄúWide Expanse of the Ocean‚Äù), Leo warned the American church leaders hierarchy not to export their unique system of separation of church and state. In 1898 he lamented an America where church and state are \\"dissevered and divorced,\\" and wrote of his preference for a closer relationship between the Catholic Church and the State, along European lines. Finally, in his pastoral letter Testem benevolentiae (1899; ‚ÄúWitness to Our Benevolence‚Äù) to Cardinal Gibbons, Leo condemned other forms of Americanism. In response, Gibbons denied that American Catholics held any of the condemned views. Leo's pronouncements effectively ended the Americanist movement and curtailed the activities of American progressive Catholics. The controversy soon died out, but the Irish Catholics increasingly demonstrated their total loyalty to the Pope, and traces of liberal thought in the Catholic colleges were suppressed. At bottom it was a cultural conflict, as the conservative Europeans were facing heavy attacks on the Catholic church from the new German empire and the French Third Republic. Accordingly, European Church leaders did not appreciate arguments put forward by Archbishop Ireland that a self-confident, optimistic American republic-- with no established church-- was the best forum for the growth of Roman Catholicism.James Hennessy, S.J., American Catholics: A history of the Roman Catholic community in the United States (1981) pp 194-203Thomas T.

Famous 1876 editorial cartoon by Thomas Nast showing bishops as crocodiles attacking public schools, with the connivance of Irish Catholic politicians Anti-Catholic animus in the United States reached a peak in the 1850s when some Protestant leaders became alarmed by the influx of Catholic immigrants. Preachers echoed the Protestant Reformation of 400 years before by calling the Catholic Church the Whore of Babylon in the Book of Revelation. Irish Catholic politicians were blamed for engaging in political corruption and violence. Nativists alleged that the Irish voters were controlled by local priests who were in the control of Rome.Ray Allen Billington, The Protestant Crusade, 1800‚Äì1860: A Study of the Origins of American Nativism (1938) online The nativist movement found expression in a short-lived national political movement called the Know- Nothing Party of the 1850s, which (unsuccessfully) ran former president Millard Fillmore as its presidential candidate in 1856. Catholic patriotism manifested by service in the Civil War undermined the movement. After the war anti-Catholic agitation, as in the American Protective Association of the 1890s received almost no support from major politicians or cultural leaders, and was in large part the product of Lutheran or Irish Protestant immigrants, especially those who brought in Orange Lodges from Canada.David H. Bennett, The Party of Fear: From Nativist Movements to the New Right in American History (University of North Carolina Press, 1988). The Catholic Church, in part, established lay fraternities and colleges such as Boston College, the College of Holy Cross, and the University of Notre Dame to upgrade its cultural status.

Nowhere else in southeastern Idaho can such habitat be found in this quantity or quality. The refuge uplands are a mix of rock, sand, and shallow soil habitat that supports a diversity of small mammals, reptiles, and invertebrates. The basalt lava flows provide habitat for some of the more diverse reptile fauna in Idaho. The Idaho dunes tiger beetle (Cicindela arenicola), a species of special concern, is found on refuge sand dunes, while the Utah valvata, an endangered snail, inhabits the reservoir. Both sage and sharptailed grouse occupy refuge habitat that is becoming increasingly important in the face of petitions to list these species.

The temple's oldest hall, the Wanfo Hall, was built in 963 during the Northern Han dynasty, and is notable for featuring very large brackets that hold up the roof and flying eaves. The sculptures inside the hall are among the only examples of 10th century Buddhist sculpture in China. History The history of the temple begins in 963, when it was recorded that Ten-Thousand Buddha Hall (W√†nf√≥ di√†n ‰∏á‰ΩõÊÆø) was built. The date is written on a beam in the hall, and is also the date given by a local history of Pingyao county written in the 19th century. A stela written in 1819 also confirms this date.Steinhardt (1997), 77. Wanfo Hall is the oldest building at Zhenguo temple, and is the only surviving building that dates from the short-lived Northern Han dynasty.Steinhardt (2002), 117. Although little is known of the temple's history, stelae record that it was renovated in 1540 and in 1816.Zhao (2007), 94. In 1997, along with Pingyao city and Shuanglin Temple, the Zhenguo temple was inscribed on the World Heritage list as ‚ÄòAncient City of Pingyao‚Äô. Layout The temple contains two main halls and a gate, with two courtyards in between the three buildings. There is a wall surrounding the entire complex. The temple opens to the south, with the Tianwang Hall (Â§©ÁéãÊÆø) acting as the temple‚Äôs gate.Steinhardt (1997), 78. The next hall, to the north, is the Ten-Thousand Buddha Hall, and the final hall is called Sanfo Hall (‰∏â‰ΩõÊÆø), which dates from the Qing Dynasty. The northern courtyard also features two minor halls facing to the east and west called the Guanyin (ËßÇÈü≥ÊÆø) and Dizang Halls (Âú∞ËóèÊÆø), which both date from the Ming Dynasty.Miller (2000), 83. There are also two bell towers located on either side of the Tianwang Hall. Ten-Thousand Buddha Hall The most important hall in the temple is Ten-Thousand Buddha Hall (W√†nf√≥ di√†n ‰∏á‰ΩõÊÆø), one of China's oldest wooden buildings. It is a three-bay single-eaves hip and gabled hall that is nearly square in shape, measures 11.6 by 10.8 meters, and is 8.8 m high.Miller (2000), 83-84. Despite the building's small size, and features that would identify it as a regular hall (such as pillars that have been implanted directly into the floor instead of on a stone pedestal), the structure is quite complex. There are doors at the front and back of the hall. In addition, the front of the hall has two windows on either side of the door. There are twelve pillars supporting the structure. The corner and column-top brackets holding up the roof are of the 7th degree, one of the most complex and large types according to Yingzao Fashi. These bracket sets are nearly 2.5 meters high ‚Äì 70% the height of the columns. Inter-columnar brackets that occur between every two pillars are of the 5th degree. The hall has no ceiling, and the upper and lower set of rafters are exposed.Steinhardt (1997), 79. Nancy Steinhardt speculates that the complex brackets on what would have been a humble structure were an attempt by the Northern Han rulers to build a magnificent structure with limited resources.Steinhardt (1997), 80. The hall contains eleven sculptures from the Northern Han period. These are the only Chinese sculptures from the period that survive from outside the Mogao Grottoes. There is a main statue of Sakyamuni flanked by Bodhisattvas and the Heavenly Kings.Howard (2006), 375. Notes References * Howard, Angela Falco, et al. Chinese Sculpture.

It is a large brick building erected in five stages from the 1840s to the 1890s. Not all of the stages built are extant. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs Its imposing clock tower has made it a landmark in the village. The county government moved out in the early 1960s. After a period of several years during which the building remained vacant, local preservation groups were able to get it reopened to serve a number of other public purposes. In 1973 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Today it is home to the local historical society and a community arts group. Property The courthouse interior features the judge's bench and some displays The courthouse complex is located on a narrow parcel of less than that extends from the street to the shore of Lake George itself. All sections are linked. They are built of masonry load-bearing walls faced in brick, on a limestone foundation with polychromatic slate roof pierced by six chimneys. The three remaining sections are, from west to east, the judges' chambers, original courthouse, and jail wing. On the judges' chambers, the western (front) facade is five bays wide and two stories tall, with a two-stage clock tower rising from the center. Below it a recessed front door is framed by an arched entranceway. Between the two stories is a double belt course on which is inscribed \\"WARREN COUNTY\\" north of the entry and tower and \\"COURT HOUSE\\" south of it. A decorative brick cornice on the second story roofline is repeated on the tower's first stage. The clock tower is topped with a hipped roof and weathervane. To its east is the original courthouse building. It is one and a half stories tall and three bays wide on either side. Pilasters divide the narrow windows, and the roof is pierced by a gabled dormer window in the center of both sides. The jail wing to its east, closest to the lakeshore, is a two-story gabled block four bays long by three wide. It has a unique structural system. The first floor is an open room without partitions or columns; the second floor's weight is supported by three steel rods suspended from trusses below the roof. Inside, the buildings have undergone many changes since they were first built, and have lost most of their architectural distinctiveness. The courthouse retains its original windows and high ceilings, and there are some original cells left in the jail wing. History Lake George was designated the county seat when Warren County was created in 1813. At the time the settlement had been growing rapidly because of its location on what was expected to be a main trade route to Canada. It was then known as Caldwell, after James Caldwell of Albany, a major landowner and businessman in the region, who had seen the potential for this trade route. West Elevation, 2008 For the first four years of the county's existence, the court met in a local coffeehouse. In 1815, Caldwell donated land at the present site for a courthouse, and one was built, as well as a clerk's office and jail. Little is known about the architecture of those buildings. County records do indicate that the courthouse had a wooden cupola which frequently needed repairs. As a result, the county had difficulty getting it insured. In 1843 the courthouse and the county clerk's office burned down. A Glens Falls architect, Winfield Sherwood, designed a replacement building that was completed two years later. This is the present courtroom building in the middle of the complex. During the 1860 election, Stephen A. Douglas is said to have delivered a campaign speech here in opposition to Abraham Lincoln. Later in the century the complex grew. In 1878 the judges' quarters were added, giving the building its distinctive clock tower. Seven years later, in 1885, the small clerk's building was replaced by a larger one that was added to the front of the judge's quarters, to some criticism of its effect on the building as a whole. The county's Board of Supervisors met either here or in the armory in Glens Falls until 1905, when a meeting room was built over the county clerk's offices. Since 1860 there had been some efforts to move the county seat to Glens Falls, which had grown much larger than Lake George because of industrialization. The county located some offices there, and some to the north in Warrensburg, but Lake George remained the county seat. In 1959 county voters approved a bond issue for a new county government complex in Queensbury, along Route 9 several miles south of the village. It was built and opened in 1963, at which time the old courthouse was finally abandoned. It was vacant for several years, and considered for demolition until the newly formed Lake George Historical Association was able to persuade the Town of Lake George, which owned it by then, to reopen it for use as the association's offices and museum. Shortly afterwards, in 1969, the 1885 front addition was torn down to restore the original view of the front of the building. In 1977, the Lake George Arts Center joined the historical society, opening a gallery in the former courtroom in addition to using the building as its headquarters as well.

Fossils are found from Late Eocene strata in Egypt. The first discovery of Biretia was a single tooth dated to approximately 37 mya, which was found in 1988 at the Bir el Ater site in Algeria. This species was named Biretia piveteaui. In 2005, two new species were classified, B. fayumensis and B. megalopsis. Both were discovered at Birket Qarun Locality 2 (BQ-2), which is located about 60 mi south of Cairo in Egypt's Fayum depression. A very small anthropoid, it only weighed around 280 to possibly 380 grams. Fragments from the jaw suggest that it had had very large eyes in proportion to its body size, which would suggest that it was nocturnal. Biretia is unique among early anthropoids in exhibiting evidence for nocturnality, but derived dental features shared with younger parapithecids draw this genus, and possibly 45-million-year-old Algeripithecus (Strepsirrhini), into a morphologically and behaviorally diverse parapithecoid clade of great antiquity.\\"Tabuce Rodolphe, Marivaux Laurent (2004) ‚ÄúMammalian interchanges between Africa and Eurasia: an analysis of temporal constraints on plausible anthropoid dispersals during the Paleogene‚Äù ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE Vol. 113, 27‚Äì32, 2005 Retrieved October 2009 The smallest of the species, B. fayumensis, had an estimated weight of 273 g, while the largest, B. megalopsis, had a weight of about 376g. Adaptations of the skull of B. megalopsis are easily comparable to the modern tarsiers, a small, modern Asian primate with a nocturnal insectivorous lifestyle. We can infer the possibility of a nocturnal lifestyle for B. megalopsis' from the animal's molar roots, which are truncated to accommodate for large eye sockets typical of a nocturnal primate. The large eye structure and similarity to the modern tarsiers also suggests that it has lost its tapetum lucidum. Thus, B. megalopsis demonstrates itself as being the oldest known nocturnal primate. The genus is otherwise known only from a handful of fossil fragments, including a few maxilla fragments and some teeth and teeth fragments from the different species. The fossil fragments found for B. fayumensis, new species, include a composite of isolated P2 (DPC 21759C), P3 (DPC 21249E), P4 (DPC 21371A), M1 (DPC 21250D), and M2 (DPC 21539E).

Prior to the Hudson‚Äôs Bay acquisition, sales were exceeding growth projections but the firm had not been profitable yet. On June 4, 2018, Boston, Massachusetts-based Rue La La acquired Gilt from HBC. History Gilt Groupe is based in New York City with warehouses in Brooklyn, New York, Las Vegas, Nevada, and Louisville, Kentucky. The company was co-founded by Kevin P. Ryan, Alexis Maybank, and Alexandra Wilson; it was modeled Gilt after Vente-Privee, an online fashion retailer in France. The original business plan consisted of \\"flash sales,\\" selling a limited number of luxury designer items at steep discounts for brief periods. The company launched women's clothing and accessories in November 2007 and menswear in April 2008. It added Gilt Groupe Japan , Gilt Fuse, and travel site Jetsetter in 2009. It later added, Gilt City and Gilt Home in 2010 and Gilt Taste in 2011. In 2012, the company entered a partnership with Jason Binn's upmarket lifestyle magazine, DuJour.\\"Catching Up With Jason Binn\\" wwd.com In 2009, growth equity firm General Atlantic led a series C funding round, joined by previous investor Matrix Partners.. By February 2014, Gilt Groupe was preparing for an IPO. According to Business Insider, during its \\"hyper-growth years, the company overextended itself and lost focus\\", as the expanded business segments such as \\"Full-price retail, travel, and food were sucking resources from Gilt's core categories ‚Äî discounted women's fashion\\", and Gilt was forced to sell these non-core businesses at a loss. Flash sales companies were also seeing slower growth, thanks in part to e-mail fatigue (the key means for flash sales to be promoted) with e-mail providers increasingly classifying these messages as spam). The IPO kept getting delayed and ending up never happening, while the firm never reached profitability. By 2015, Gilt was raising money \\"at a lower valuation than the $1 billion at which it reportedly raised $138 million in 2011\\". Such a cash infusion is known as \\"down round\\" which hurts employee morale and devalues the founders' stakes. On January 7, 2016, Gilt Groupe announced its acquisition by Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company, owner of luxury department store chains Hudson‚Äôs Bay, Lord & Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue, for $250 million, less than the amount raised from investors in all of the company's prior funding rounds. In June 2018 it was announced the HBC would be selling Gilt to Rue La La. The sale was reported to be for less than half of what HBC paid for Gilt, two years prior, with a price of $100 million. On October 2, 2019 Gilt Groupe and Simon Property Group announced a joint venture for ShopPremiumOutlets.com, an online shopping platform focused on its outlet malls, to create a new e-commerce platform dedicated to value shopping.

The complex spans more than 250 miles of Maine coastline and includes five national wildlife refuges ‚Äî Petit Manan, Cross Island, Franklin Island, Seal Island, and Pond Island. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service manages the refuge complex as part of the National Wildlife Refuge System. The Service's primary focus at Maine Coastal Islands Refuge is restoring and managing colonies of nesting seabirds. Refuge islands provide habitat for common, Arctic, and endangered roseate terns; Atlantic puffins; razorbills; black guillemots; Leach's storm- petrels; herring, greater black-backed, and laughing gulls; double-crested and great cormorants; and common eiders. Over the last 25 years, the Service has worked to reverse the decline in these birds' populations. As a result, many species have returned to islands where they nested historically. In addition to seabirds, wading birds and bald eagles nest on refuge islands. The mainland divisions provide habitat for songbirds, shorebirds, and waterfowl, as well as opportunities for bird watching and hiking. Wildlife and Habitat Maine Coastal Islands National Wildlife Refuge consists of four mainland divisions (4,277 acres) and 50 islands (3,895 acres). The refuge islands span over 250 miles of the Maine coast and support a tremendous diversity of wildlife. The majority of the islands within the refuge are considered nationally significant nesting islands, and support endangered and threatened species, colonial nesting seabirds, wading birds, and waterfowl. Habitat characteristics vary considerably among the islands. While some islands provide dense stands of red spruce and balsam fir for nesting bald eagles and wading birds, other islands provide great expanses of mixed grasses and raspberries which support nesting terns, common eiders, and a number of neotropical migrants. The rocky ledges surrounding the islands provide nesting habitat for Atlantic puffins, razorbills, and black guillemots. The inter- tidal areas surrounding the islands and mainland properties provide an abundance of invertebrates for migratory and wintering waterfowl and shorebirds. The diversity of upland habitats and the extensive inter-tidal habitats combine to provide foraging, breeding, and migratory habitat for over 320 species of birds. Eight of the islands within Maine Coastal Islands National Wildlife Refuge currently support seabird restoration projects. The primary focus of these projects is to re-establish breeding populations of common, Arctic, and roseate terns, Atlantic puffins, and razorbills on historic nesting islands. The combined efforts of the Refuge and our conservation partners have proven highly successful, and all five species have experienced significant population growth as a result of our efforts. The four mainland units are located in the Towns of Corea, Gouldsboro, Steuben, and Milbridge, Maine, and also provide a diversity of habitat for a wide variety of species. The majority of habitat on all four parcels is dominated by mature forest, but the refuge also protects several salt marshes, a diverse mix of freshwater wetlands, and several grassland and blueberry fields. The freshwater wetlands on Petit Manan Point are used by thousands of migratory waterfowl during the fall months.

The refuge provides important feeding and nesting habitat for many bird species, including waterfowl, wading birds, shorebirds, upland game birds, songbirds, and birds of prey. The refuge consists of two divisions. The Baring Division covers and is located off U.S. Route 1, southwest of Calais, Maine. The Edmunds Division is between Dennysville and Whiting on U.S. Route 1 and borders the tidal waters of Cobscook Bay. Each division contains a National Wilderness Area, thousands of acres managed to preserve their wild character for future generation. The East Coast Greenway, connecting Calais, Maine to Key West, Florida, runs through part of the refuge. Wildlife and habitat The refuge's landscape is varied, with rolling hills, large ledge outcrops, streams, lakes, bogs, and marshes. A northern hardwood forest of aspen, maple, birch, spruce and fir dominates the upland. Scattered stands of majestic white pine are common. The Edmunds Division boasts several miles of rocky shoreline where tidal fluctuations of up to occur twice a day. This habitat diversity supports many wildlife species. The staff at Moosehorn National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) manages the land to protect the Service's \\"trust resources\\". which include migratory birds, endangered species,and wetlands. By improving habitat, the Service ensures that wildlife will thrive on the refuge. Woodcock, black bear, ruffed grouse, lynx, beaver, red fox, river otter, gray fox, moose, bobcat, coyote, raccoon, mink, deer, and a variety of songbirds prosper only in a young forest. In the past, wildfires revitalized the forest, while farming maintained open areas. However, wildfire is a rare event today, and farmland acreage has decreased dramatically. Habitat management programs, including timber harvesting and controlled burning, mimic the effects of wildfire and farming by providing clearings and early growth forests. Small clearcuts scattered throughout the forest provide openings and young, brushy growth that serve as food and cover for many wildlife species. Each year, the Service awards timber units to local harvesters according to the refuge forest management plan. The harvesters pay for the timber based on a fixed stumpage schedule. Much of this revenue is returned to the community in lieu of property taxes. This management has produced significant an increases in woodcock, grouse, bear, and moose populations. Approximately one third of the refuge is designated as federal wilderness. The two Wilderness Areas (one in each division) are part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. They are managed with a \\"hands-off\\" philosophy and granted special protection to maintain their primitive qualities. Internal combustion engines and mechanical means of transportation (i.e. bicycles) are not allowed. Habitat management is kept to a minimum to allow the areas to develop into old- growth climax forests. Bald eagles, frequent both divisions of the refuge, feeding on fish in the streams, ponds, and flowages. In recent years, as many as three pairs of eagles have nested at Moosehorn NWR. Eagles are frequently sighted around Magurrewock Marsh on the Baring Division and along the shore of Dennys Bay on the Edmunds Division. Osprey nest in several of the refuge marshes with as many as four pairs using platforms along the Charlotte Road. The woodlands of Moosehorn NWR are home to many songbirds, including neotropical migrants, species that breed in North America and winter in Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central and South America. In mid-May, a flush of migrating warblers fills the forest with song. Twenty-six species of these diminutive birds nest on the refuge. In addition, northern forest species, such as boreal chickadees and spruce grouse, are present.

It is celebrated in honour of the notional return of the daitya-king Bali to earth. Bali Padyami falls in the Gregorian calendar months October‚ÄìNovember. It is the first day of the Hindu month Kartika and is the start of the bright lunar fortnight. In many parts of India such as Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka, it is the traditional New Year Day in Vikram Samvat and sometimes called the Bestu Baras or Varsha Pratipada.Bestu Varas: For Gujratis celebrations continue the day after Diwali too, The Times of India (October 25 2011) The Balipratipada is an ancient festival. The earliest mention of Bali's story being acted out in dramas and poetry of ancient India is found in the c. 2nd-century BCE MahƒÅbhƒÅ·π£ya of Patanjali on Panini's Astadhyayi 3.1.26. The festival has links to the Vedic era sura-asura Samudra Manthan that revealed goddess Lakshmi and where Mahabali was the king of the asuras. The mythology and festivities find mention in the Mahabharata, the Ramayana, and several major Puranas, such as the Brahma purana, Kurma purana, Matsya purana and others. Balipratipada commemorates the annual return of Mahabali to earth and the victory of Vamana ‚Äì one of many creative incarnations of Vishnu and the fifth incarnation in the Dashavatara list. It marks the victory of Vishnu over Mahabali and all asuras, through his metamorphosis into Trivikrama. At the time of his defeat, Bali was already a Vishnu-devotee and a benevolent ruler over a peaceful, prosperous kingdom. Vishnu's treacherous victory over Mahabali using \\"three steps\\" ended the war. According to Hindu mythology, Mahabali asked for and was granted the boon by Vishnu, whereby he returns to earth once a year when he will be remembered and worshipped, and reincarnate in a future birth as Indra. Balipratipada or Padva is traditionally celebrated with decorating the floor with colorful images of Bali ‚Äì sometimes with his wife Vindyavati, of nature's abundance, a shared feast, community events and sports, drama or poetry sessions. In some regions, rice and food offerings are made to recently dead ancestors (shraddha), or the horns of cows and bulls are decorated, people gamble, or icons of Vishnu avataras are created and garlanded in addition. Nomenclature Balipratipada is also called Padva, and community cultural events are a part of its celebrations in western states of India; above a musical concert. Balipratipada (, or ‡§™‡§æ‡§°‡§µ‡§æ, or ) is a compound word consisting of \\"Bali\\" (a mythical daitya king, also known as Mahabali) and \\"pratipada\\" (also called padva, means occasion, commence, first day of a lunar fortnight). It is also called the Akashadipa (lights of the sky). Texts The Balipratipada and Bali-related mythology is ancient. The earliest mention of Bali's story is found in the c. 2nd-century BCE MahƒÅbhƒÅ·π£ya of Patanjali on Panini's Astadhyayi 3.1.26. It states that \\"Balim bandhayati\\" refers to a person reciting the Bali legend or acting it out on a stage. This, states P.V. Kane ‚Äì a Sanskrit literature scholar, attests that the \\"imprisonment of Bali\\" legend was well known by the 2nd-century BCE in forms of drama and poetry in ancient India. According to Tracy Pintchman ‚Äì an Indologist, the festival has links to the Samudra Manthan legend found in Vedic texts. These describe a cosmic struggle between suras and asuras, with Mahabali as the king of the asuras. It is this legendary churning of cosmic ocean that created Lakshmi ‚Äì the goddess worshipped on Diwali. The remembrance and festivities associated with Lakshmi and Mahabali during Diwali are linked. The mythology and festivities related to Bali and Balipratipada find mention in the Vanaparva 28.2 of the Mahabharata, the Ramayana, and several major Puranas, such as the Brahma purana (chapter 73), Kurma purana (chapter 1), Matsya purana (chapters 245 and 246), and others. The Hindu text Dharmasindhu in its discussions of Diwali states that day after the Diwali night, Balipratipada is one of three most auspicious dates in the year. It recommends an oil bath and a worship of Bali. His icon along with his wife's should be drawn on the floor with five colored powder and flowers. Fruits and food should be offered to Bali, according to Bhavisyottra, and drama or other community spectacles should be organized. The Hindu texts suggest that the devout should light lamps, wear new clothes, tie auspicious threads or wear garland, thank their tools of art, decorate and pray before the cows and bulls, organize delightful community sports (kaumudi-mahotsava) in temple or palace grounds such as pulling tug-of- war ropes. Legend Mahabali was Prahlada's grandson. He came to power by defeating the gods (Devas), and taking over the three worlds. Bali, an Asura king was well known for his bravery, uprightness and dedication to god Vishnu. Bali had amassed vast territories and was invincible. He was benevolent and popular, but his close associates weren't like him. They were constantly attacking the suras (Devas) and plundering the gods who stood for righteousness and justice. According to Vaishnavism mythology, Indra and the defeated suras approached Vishnu for help in their battle with Mahabali. Vishnu refused to join the gods in violence against Mahabali, because Mahabali was a good ruler and his own devotee. But, instead of promising to kill Bali, Vishnu promised to use a treacherous means to help the suras. Mahabali announced that he will perform Yajna (homa sacrifices) and grant anyone any gift they want during the Yajna. Vishnu took the avatar of a dwarf Brahmin called Vamana and approached Mahabali. The king offered anything to the boy ‚Äì gold, cows, elephants, villages, food, whatever he wished. The boy said that one must not seek more than one needs, and all he needs is the property right over a piece of land that measures \\"three paces\\". Mahabali agreed. The Vamana grew to enormous proportions, metamorphosing into the Trivikrama form, and covered everything Mahabali ruled over in just two paces. For the third pace, Mahabali offered his own head to Vishnu who pushed him as the king of patala (nether world). Pleased with the dedication and integrity of Bali, Vishnu granted him a boon that he could return to earth for one day in a year to be with his people, be worshipped and be a future Indra. It is this day that is celebrated as the Bali Padyami, the annual return of Bali from the netherworld to earth. Another version of the legend states that after Vamana pushed Bali below ground (patalaloka), at the request of Prahlada (described as a great devotee of Vishnu), the grandfather of Bali, Vishnu pardoned Bali and made him the king of the netherworld. Vishnu also granted the wish of Bali to return to earth for one day marked by festivities and his worship. Festivities Rangoli with lights in Hyderabad, Telangana The rituals observed on the Bali Padyami day have variations from state to state. In general, on this festival day, Hindus exchange gifts, as it is considered a way to please Bali and the gods. After the ceremonial Oil Bath, people wear new clothes. The main hall of the house or the space before the door or gate is decorated with a Rangoli or Kolam drawn with powder of rice in different colours, thereafter Bali and his wife Vindhyavali are worshipped. Some build Bali icons out of clay or cow dung. In the evening, as night falls, door sills of every house and temple are lighted with lamps arranged in rows. Community sports and feasts are a part of the celebrations. Some people gamble with a game called pachikalu (dice game), which is linked to a legend. It is believed that god Shiva and his consort Parvati played this game on this festival day when Parvati won. Following this, their son Kartikeya played with Parvati and defeated her. Thereafter, his brother, the elephant-headed god of wisdom Ganesha played with him and won the dice game. But now this gambling game is played only by family members, symbolically, with cards. The Bali-Vamana-Trivikrama legend relief in a Nepalese Hindu temple. The farming community celebrates this festival, particularly in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, by performing Kedaragauri vratam (worship of goddess KedaraGauri ‚Äì a form of Parvati), Gopuja (worship of cow), and Gouramma puja (worship of Gauri ‚Äì another form of Parvati). Before worship of cows, on this day, the goushala (cowshed) is also ceremoniously cleaned. On this day, a triangular shaped image of Bali, made out of cow-dung is placed over a wooden plank designed with colourful Kolam decorations and bedecked with marigold flowers and worshipped. Related festivals Onam is a major festival of Kerala based on the same mythology, but observed in August‚ÄìSeptember. In the contemporary era, it commemorates Mahabali. Celebrations include a vegetarian feast, gift giving, parades featuring Bali and Vishnu avataras, floor decorations and community sports. According to A.M. Kurup, the history of Onam festival as evidenced by literature and inscriptions found in Kerala suggest \\"Onam was a temple-based community festival celebrated over a period\\". The festivities of Onam are found in MaturaikkƒÅ√±ci ‚Äì a Sangam era Tamil poem, which mentions the festival being celebrated in Madurai temples with games and duels in temple premises, oblations being sent to the temples, people wore new clothes and feasted. The 9th-century Pathikas and Pallads by Periyazharwar, according to Kurup, describes Onam celebrations and offerings to Vishnu, mentions feasts and community events. Several inscriptions from 11th and 12th-century in Hindu temples such as the Thrikkakara Temple (Kochi, dedicated to Vamana) and the Sreevallabha Temple (Tiruvalla, dedicated to Vishnu) attest to offerings dedicated to Vamana on Onam. In contemporary Kerala, the festival is observed by both Hindus and non-Hindus, with the exception of Muslims among whom isolated celebration is observed., Quote: \\"Onam is of course not celebrated by Muslims; for it commemorates the victory of the Hindu demon king Mahabali who, in Hindu lore, founded Kerala. Contemporary Islamic reformist ulema even advise Muslims to refuse invitations from Hindu neighbours who may wish to call them to eat on Thiruvonam. From the outset, then, this Muslim family‚Äôs plan to make an Onam feast had the air of a daring and naughty secret.\\" See also *Mahabali *Onam References Further reading * Category:Hindu festivals Category:Diwali Category:October observances Category:November observances Category:Religious festivals in India ","title":"Balipratipada"},{"id":"24671523","text":"Turbulence is the second and last album by rock band Aviator.

The refuge was established in 1988 to ensure the ecological integrity of the Sunkhaze Meadows peat bog and the continued availability of its wetland, stream, forest and wildlife resources to the citizens of the United States. The purpose of acquisition, under the authority of the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 was \\"... for the development, advancement, management, conservation, and protection of fish and wildlife resources ...\\" and \\"... for the benefit of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, in performing its activities and services.

It contains several raised bogs or domes, separated from each other by extensive areas of streamside meadows. Sunkhaze Stream bisects the refuge along a northeast to southwest orientation and, with its six tributaries, creates a diversity of wetland communities. The bog and stream wetlands, along with the adjacent uplands and associated transition zones, provide important habitat for many wildlife species. The wetland complex consists primarily of wet meadows, shrub thickets, cedar swamps, extensive red and silver maple floodplain forests and open freshwater stream habitats, along with those plant communities associated with peatlands such as shrub heaths and cedar and spruce bogs. Sunkhaze Meadows National Wildlife Refuge provides habitat for three plants, seven birds, two mollusks and three invertebrates listed as Endangered or Threatened by the State of Maine. In the early 1990s, the Benton and Sandy Stream Divisions were added to the refuge under the auspices of the 1990 Farm Bill. These small areas are respectively located in the towns of Benton and Unity, Maine. Both are managed for grassland-nesting birds, some of which are rare in Maine. Four conservation easements are also managed by Sunkhaze Meadows Refuge. They are the Downing, Fortin, Miller, and Quayle Easements, totaling seven separate parcels of land. Downing Easement lands are located in the towns of Corinth and Exeter.

Through Mullen's support at various nightclubs in California, the scene gave birth to such bands as the Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Go-Go's, X, The Weirdos and the Germs. Early life Mullen was born in Paisley, Scotland, and moved to Stockport near Manchester, England when he was eight years old. He spent his early teen years writing for various British music magazines. He also worked as a local newspaper journalist at the Barnet Press in the London Borough of Barnet from 1972 to 1973. Move to the United States In 1973, Mullen moved to the United States, where he resided for the remainder of his life. His family, father, mother, sister and brother remained in the Stockport area. His brother, Len Mullen, was a well known local athlete running 1:53 for Stockport Harriers, and appeared as a named extra in the film Chariots of Fire appearing in the famous beach scene. Brendan maintained close links with his family periodically visiting his old home town of Stockport. On one occasion in the early 1990s a visit to The Boardwalk club in Manchester and meeting by chance the band's manager, resulted in British indie group The Railway Children playing a gig in Brendan's New York Club. The Masque In 1977, Mullen founded The Masque, a small punk rock club in central Hollywood, California, which existed intermittently from 1977 to 1979. Mullen originally only wanted a place to practice music; however the owner of the building offered him the basement for $850 a month allowing him to set up numerous rehearsal spaces for the burgeoning punk music community. City officials refused to approve permits required to run it as a legal nightclub and shut the club down in 1978. Fire marshals sued Mullen to end the lease and many bands came to his aid with two nights of benefit concerts to raise money to pay legal fees. Both shows culminated in rioting. Club Lingerie and others After the closure of The Masque, Mullen spent much of the next decade booking shows for another popular L.A. club called Club Lingerie. Club Lingerie was known more for its eclectic bookings that ran from punk and pop to jazz and blues, as well as the first West Coast appearances by several New York-based hip-hop acts. In 1983, Mullen had his first encounter with Anthony Kiedis and Flea, who came into the club with their newly recorded demo tape, demanding Mullen listen to it. The duo proceeded to play the demo on a boombox they carried around and danced around like maniacs to their music. The music impressed Mullen, as did the duo's energy. He offered their band, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, an opening slot on an upcoming Bad Brains show. Kiedis and Flea ended up becoming longtime friends with Mullen until his death. The band credits Mullen with being one of their first major supporters and giving them their start. Mullen also booked a wider range of performances at the Variety Arts Center downtown in the mid-to-late '80s. Mullen would later work for other clubs in the area such as The Viper Room and Luna Park. Death On October 12, 2009, the website Media Bistro reported that Mullen had been rushed to a Los Angeles hospital, having suffered a serious stroke. The Los Angeles Times confirmed his death at the Ventura County Medical Center shortly thereafter. At the time of his stroke, Mullen was celebrating his 60th birthday by traveling through Santa Barbara and Ventura with Kateri Butler, his companion of 16 years. Doctors were surprised by his stroke saying he had none of the indicators, his cholesterol was perfect. One of the neurologists who treated Mullen stated, 'Sometimes, your number is just up.' Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea wrote a two-page article for the Los Angeles Times on the passing of Mullen. Mullen had just started working toward U.S. citizenship at the time of his death. One of his last projects, which he was unable to complete before his death, was helping the Red Hot Chili Peppers co-author their autobiography, An Oral/Visual History by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The book was published on October 19, 2010, a little over a year after Mullen's death. In popular culture The Red Hot Chili Peppers' 2011 album, I'm With You features the song \\"Brendan's Death Song\\", a tribute to Mullen. According to Anthony Kiedis, he was told about Mullen's death on the first day of rehearsals for the album. He went to rehearsals and informed the band of Mullen's death and without talking, the band quickly started to play music and the song came to the band quickly out of a jam. Kiedis described the song as having the feel of a death march but \\"it's more of a celebration than a bummer.\\" On March 7, 2012, the Chili Peppers announced that \\"Brendan's Death Song\\" would be released as the fifth single from their album although the song was rarely performed on the band's I'm with You World Tour and would film the music video for the song in New Orleans. The concept of the video is a jazz funeral.

The legal system of Hong Kong is based on the common law system of England and Wales. It has a similar training and qualification process for solicitors and barristers.

Between these two points, the highway passes through the entire width of Oklahoma; a total of of US-64 lies in the state of Oklahoma. US-64 enters the state from New Mexico, crossing the line between the two states between Clayton, New Mexico, and Boise City in Cimarron County. The route runs the full length of the Oklahoma Panhandle, then serves the northernmost tier of counties in the main body of the state before dipping southeastward to Tulsa, the state's second-largest city. From Tulsa, the highway continues southeast, leaving Oklahoma just west of Fort Smith, Arkansas. In addition to Tulsa, US-64 serves fifteen Oklahoma counties and the cities of Guymon, Woodward, Enid, and Muskogee. US-64 has been a part of the United States Numbered Highways system from the program's inception in 1926. US-64's route has remained roughly the same since then, although it has undergone alterations several times, many changing its course through towns and moving the highway designation to higher-capacity expressways and freeways. Route description The Panhandle US-64 east of Boise City U.S. Route 64 crosses the New Mexico‚ÄìOklahoma state line northeast of Clayton, New Mexico, concurrent with US-56 and US-412. The three highways enter the state just north of the extreme southwest corner of Cimarron County, the westernmost tip of the Oklahoma Panhandle. The highways head northeast, passing through disconnected parcels of the Rita Blanca National Grassland. The first town US-56, US-64, and US-412 encounter in Oklahoma is unincorporated Felt, of which they skirt the northern edge. The highways then cross the Beaver River before intersecting US-385, which joins the other three highways in a concurrency as they approach Boise City, the county seat. In Boise City, the highways reach a traffic circle which surrounds the Cimarron County Courthouse. At this traffic circle, US-56, US-64, and US-412 all turn east, while US-385 splits away to the north. State Highway 3 (SH-3) enters the circle from the north and leaves from the east, following US-64, while SH-325 begins at the circle and heads west toward Kenton. East of town, US-56/US-64/US-412/SH-3 have an interchange with US-287, which bypasses Boise City to the east. northeast of here, US-56 splits away from the other highways; it continues northeast, while US-64/US-412/SH-3 turn onto a due east course. The routes intersect SH-171 east of the split. Approximately east of the SH-171 junction, US-64/US-412/SH-3 cross into Texas County. east of the county line, at unincorporated Four Corners, SH-95 joins the concurrency; it splits away after following the other three routes for . The next major highway junction lies to the east, where SH-136 joins with US-64/US-412/SH-3 as the highways turn south toward Guymon. The four highways cross the Beaver River once again before entering that city, Texas County's seat and the largest city in the Panhandle, on Main Street. In Guymon, US-64 splits away to the east along NE 12th Street, while US-412 and state highways 3 and 136 continue south. US-64 is accompanied on 12th Street by truck routes for the latter three highways. At the intersection with US-54, the truck routes turn southwest, while US-64 turns northeast, following US-54 out of town US-54/US-64 continue northeast through eastern Texas County, running parallel to a Union Pacific rail line. After crossing the Beaver River (the only crossing for US-54, but the third for US-64), the highways cut through the northwest corner of the town of Optima. Continuing northeast, US-54 and US-64 run just southeast of Panoma before coming to Hooker. There, US-54/US-64 serve as the northern terminus of SH-94. After the SH-94 junction, US-54 continues northeast toward Tyrone and Liberal, Kansas, while US-64 splits off onto a due east course. The road passes south of Baker before leaving Texas County. Next, US-64 passes through Beaver County, the easternmost of the three counties forming the Oklahoma Panhandle. About east of the county line, US-64 reaches the town of Turpin; here, the highway begins a concurrency with US-83. Approximately north of Turpin, the two highways come to a junction with US-270. US-83 and westbound US-270 continue north from this junction toward Liberal, while US-64 and US-270 eastbound form a concurrency heading due east. Passing north of Floris, the highways proceed east for about without any curves or junctions with other highways before reaching Forgan. East of Forgan lies a highway junction with SH-23‚Äîhere, US-270 splits away from US-64, turning south along SH-23 en route to the county seat, Beaver. SH-23 joins US-64 to form a concurrency before also splitting away toward its northern terminus at the Kansas line. US-64 does not intersect any other highways in the segment of highway in Beaver County east of the SH-23 junction. As it zig- zags southeastward, the highway passes through the towns of Knowles and Gate. east of Gate, the highway crosses the Beaver‚ÄìHarper county line, the eastern boundary of the Oklahoma Pandhandle, and enters the main body of the state. Northern Oklahoma Just east of its entry into Harper County, US-412 begins a concurrency with US-283. The two highways pass through Rosston, then US-283 splits away to the south toward Laverne. US-64 continues alone on a due east course for before reaching the northern terminus of SH-46. The highway continues east, then veers northeast, and turns back to the east before meeting up with US-183 on the south side of Buffalo, the county seat. US-64 turns north at this intersection, overlapping US-183 through town. The two routes part ways northeast of town, with US-183 continuing on a northerly course toward Kansas and US-64 turning east once again. On the east end of the county, US-64 begins another concurrency, this time with SH-34. About east of the junction, the two highways cross the Cimarron River, which forms the northeastern boundary of Harper County. US-64 in Woods County As US-64 and SH-34 cross the Cimarron River, the two highways enter Woods County. SH-34 splits off to the north shortly thereafter. US-64 continues on east, passing through unincorporated Plainview and turning southeast to intersect SH-50 at its northern terminus at Camp Houston, north of Freedom. The next highway junction is just over east of Camp Houston, and is the northern terminus of SH-14 as signed; however, ODOT documents show SH-14 continuing east along US-64 from this point for slightly less than . The two highways proceed into the Woods County seat, Alva, where they join US-281. This concurrency lasts about before US-281 splits off to the north on the east side of town; at this point, SH-14 ends. US-64 continues east by itself for before reaching the eastern limit of Woods County. The next county that US-64 serves on its path across Oklahoma is Alfalfa County. After passing through rural Alfalfa county, it approaches the unincorporated Ingersoll, whereupon it continues another until the route intersects state highways 8, 11, and 58. All three of these highways extend north from the intersection, while SH-11 continues east. US-64 turns south at this intersection, overlapping SH-8 and SH-58. They then pass through Cherokee, seat of Alfalfa County. About south of town, SH-8 splits away to the southwest, while US-64 and SH-58 turn due east. Approximately east of that intersection, SH-58 also splits away, headed south toward Helena. US-64 proceeds east to Jet, where it forms the southern terminus of SH-38. Four miles west of Jet, the highway exits Alfalfa County. Upon leaving Alfalfa County, US-64 passes into Grant County. The first town the highway passes through in Grant County is Nash, where it begins a concurrency with SH-132. This concurrency lasts for before SH-132 splits away. east of this junction, US-64 intersects US-60 and US-81 in a T junction. US-81 northbound and US-60 eastbound continue straight, while US-64 eastbound turns south along with southbound US-81 and westbound US-60 (creating a wrong-way concurrency with US-60). The three highways continue south into Garfield County. south of the T junction, US-60 / US-64 / US-81 serve as the eastern terminus of SH-45. This junction marks the highways' entry into the Enid area. The highways serve as the city limit boundary between Enid (to the west) and North Enid (to the east). About south of the SH-45 junction, US-64 splits away from the other two highways at an interchange where US-64 continues south and US-60 / US-81 take a southwesterly tack. US-64 heads south from the interchange on North 4th Street. At Willow Road, US-64 turns due east; it follows Willow Road for about before turning south on North 30th Street. This street has a parclo interchange with Owen K. Garriott Road, which carries US-412; here, US-64 joins US-412, and the two highways head due east out of Enid as a four-lane expressway. East of Enid, the two routes pass between Breckenridge and Fairmont. South of Garber lies an interchange between US-64 / US-412 and SH-74. SH-15 also begins here, extending north along SH-74. US-64 / US-412 continue east out of Garfield County. US-64 and US-412 next enter Noble County. The two highways' first junction with another highway in the county is a cloverleaf interchange at I-35 (exit 194 on the interstate). US-412 continues straight through the interchange, forming the Cimarron Turnpike, while US-64 follows I-35 southbound. US-64 splits away from the interstate in Perry at exit 186, heading due east, deeper into Perry. In downtown Perry, about east of I-35, US-64 has a brief concurrency with US-77. US-64 continues east out of Perry. West of Morrison, the highway crosses US-177. US-64 then passes through Morrison. East of town, US-64 has an interchange with the Cimarron Turnpike, still carrying US-412, at turnpike exit 22. US-64 continues northeast to Lela, where it serves as the northern terminus of SH-108, which runs along the Noble‚ÄìPawnee county line. US-64 continues east into Pawnee County. About into Pawnee County, US-64 enters the county seat, Pawnee. Here, the route begins a concurrency with SH-18. The two highways head southeast out of town together for just over before SH-18 splits off to the south toward Lone Chimney. US-64 continues alone to the east for about before beginning another concurrency, this time with SH-99, on the outskirts of Cleveland. The two highways leave Cleveland, proceeding east through unincorporated territory, before re-entering the city. Here, the two highways head in separate directions, with SH-99 heading north and US-64 heading southeast. This portion of the highway runs parallel to Keystone Lake, a reservoir formed by the impounded Arkansas River. US-64 intersects with SH-48 at the latter's northern terminus before merging with US-412 in a partial interchange (the missing movements are provided via SH-48). This interchange is also the Cimarron Turnpike's eastern endpoint. Tulsa area US-64 / US-412 continue east from the eastern terminus of the Cimarron Turnpike in southeastern Pawnee as a freeway known as the Keystone Expressway. This highway continues eastward along a peninsula into Lake Keystone. Here, the highway serves as the southern limit of Westport and Mule Barn, which remains an incorporated town despite having a population of zero. The freeway turns southeast, briefly entering Westport before crossing Lake Keystone into Osage County. US-64 and US-412 run through Osage County for just under , cutting across a corner of the county before entering Tulsa County. Upon entering Tulsa County, US-64 / US-412 serve as the northern terminus of SH-151. The freeway passes through an outlying parcel of Sand Springs, running parallel to the Arkansas River, before emerging into unincorporated territory. Proceeding east, the freeways re-enter Sand Springs, passing through an interchange with SH-97 just south of downtown. SH-51 joins the Keystone Expressway at this interchange. The freeway then enters Tulsa (estimated population 394,098 ), the second-largest city in Oklahoma. The Keystone Expressway continues to an interchange at the northwest corner of the Inner Dispersal Loop (IDL), a ring of freeways encircling downtown Tulsa. At this interchange, US-64 meets I-244 and the L.L. Tisdale Parkway. US-412 follows I-244 east, while US-64 and SH-51 turn south along I-244 westbound. The three highways then run along the western side of the IDL. At the southwest corner of the loop lies an interchange serving as the western terminus of unsigned I-444. US-64 and SH-51 split away from I-244 at this interchange to join I-444 and US-75. I-444, US-64, US-75, and SH-51 head east along the south leg of the IDL. At the southeast corner of the IDL, the highways part ways; I-444 and US-75 turn north along the east side of the IDL, while US-64 and SH-51 split off to the east. US-64 and SH-51 proceed southeast from downtown along another freeway, the Broken Arrow Expressway. Between Lewis Avenue and Sheridan Road, a rail line runs down the median of the highway. After the freeway splits away from the railroad alignment, it comes to an interchange with I-44 / SH-66. From here, the Broken Arrow Expressway heads southeast to an interchange with the Mingo Valley Expressway, which carries US-169. Here, US-64 splits away to follow the southbound Mingo Valley Expressway, while SH-51 continues southeast on the Broken Arrow Expressway. US-64 / US-169 follow a due south course to an interchange with the Creek Turnpike. The freeway merges with a free section of the turnpike, heading west. At an interchange with Memorial Drive, US-64 turns south, splitting away from the freeway. US-169 ends at this point, and tolls resume on the Creek Turnpike to the west of the interchange. From here, US-64 proceeds south on Memorial Drive into Bixby. In Bixby, the highway crosses the Arkansas River for the second time. Further south, it serves as the eastern terminus of SH-67. On the southern outskirts of Bixby, it turns east, passing through unincorporated Leonard before exiting Tulsa County. Eastern Oklahoma Southeast of Leonard, US-64 cuts across extreme southwestern Wagoner County, passing through Stone Bluff, before entering Muskogee County. Approximately south of the county line, the highway serves the town of Haskell, where it begins a concurrency with SH-72 and junctions with SH-104 at its western terminus. US-64 and SH-72 head south from Haskell, passing through unincorporated Jamesville and coming to a junction south of the settlement. Here, SH-72 splits away from US-64, continuing a southbound course straight through the junction to join westbound US-62. The western leg of this junction leads to westbound SH-16. US-64 turns to the east, joined by eastbound US-62 and SH-16. The three routes serve as the southern terminus of SH-162, a spur route to Taft. The road forms a gentle S-curve as it comes into the city of Muskogee, the county seat. Here, the routes split ways at an intersection with US-69; US-62 ad SH-16 turn north along US-69, while US-64 follows southbound US-69. US-62 BUS / US-64 BUS continue east from the intersection. US-64 / US-69 continue south to an intersection with Peak Boulevard, where US-64 heads east on its own. US-62 follows Peak Boulevard for about , exiting at an interchange with US-64 Business; mainline US-64 continues south past the terminus of US-64 Business, while SH-165 continues east on Peak Boulevard. US-64 proceeds south for just under to Warner, where it forms the eastern terminus of US-266 and the northern terminus of SH-2. US-64 turns back to the east here, running parallel to I-40 between Warner and Webbers Falls, where it has an interchange with the Muskogee Turnpike. East of the turnpike interchange, US-64 begins a concurrency with SH-100. The two highways pass northwest of downtown Webbers Falls before crossing the Arkansas River, which forms the boundary of Muskogee County, a third time. The final county US-64 passes through on its trek through Oklahoma is Sequoyah County, where much of its path loosely follows that of I-40. SH-100 splits away from US-64 at an intersection about east of the Muskogee‚ÄìSequoyah county line, in Gore. At this same intersection, US-64 is joined by SH-10, which follows it out of Gore before splitting off southeast of town. US-64 continues alone to the town of Vian, where it intersects SH-82. East of Vian, US-64 serves the county seat, Sallisaw, where it overlaps US-59. On the southeast side of the city, it comes to an interchange with I-40 (exit 311 from the Interstate). US-64 heast southeast from Sallisaw, turning back to the east at the eastern terminus of SH-141. It crosses under I-40 just east of here, although there are no ramps between the two roads. US-64 then enters Muldrow. Here, the highway intersects SH-64B. US-64 then continues into Roland, where another interchange with I-40 (exit 325) is located. The highway then turns southeast, passing north of Moffett, with two interchanges serving SH-64D, which heads north to Dora, Arkansas, and Grand Boulevard, which heads south into Moffett. US-64 then crosses the Arkansas River a fourth time, the final crossing in Oklahoma; the river's east bank is the Oklahoma‚ÄìArkansas state line. History US-64 was one of the original United States Numbered Highways designated at the highway system's creation on November 11, 1926. It stretched from the New Mexico state line in the Oklahoma panhandle east to the Arkansas state line near Fort Smith. The original route included two sharp, right-angle turns near the city of Freedom. On February 19, 1934, the Oklahoma Highway Commission approved the re-routing of US-64 onto a roadway a bit further west to eliminate these turns. On November 9, 1937, the highway was re-routed through the city of Tulsa, as well. Later, in 1943 just south of the city of Muskogee, US-64 and SH-2, which was then concurrent with US-64, were relocated slightly to the west to allow for the new Davis Field air base to be constructed at the place the highways had run before relocation. On July 7, 1947, another modification to the route was made, moving its western terminus from the northern portion of the panhandle to a new roadway in the southern section. The next significant change to the highway took place on April 4, 1960, when it was realigned to the north between the cities of Gore and Vian. Two years later, on April 4, 1962, US-64 was relocated to the north west of Tulsa, near Sand Springs. On November 4, 1963, a bypass was added through the city of Enid. It was designated as US-64 Bypass and ran on Willow Avenue and 30th Street. A couple of months later, on February 3, 1964, US-64 was moved onto a freeway through the southeastern portion of Tulsa. Later, on December 1 of the same year, similar reroutings through Tulsa and Broken Arrow were approved by the Oklahoma Department of Highways. The routing of US-64 was modified further on July 6, 1965, through the city of Enid. The routing of US-64 Bypass, which was designated two years earlier, was replaced by that of US-64 itself, and what used to be US-64 became part of a new business loop (US-64 Bus.) through the city. The Oklahoma Department of Highways approved a rerouting of the designation onto a freeway south of Muskogee on October 3, 1966, and a relocation slightly to the north between Jamesville and Muskogee on July 10, 1967. However, neither of these modifications was completed until around 1969. Then, on June 1, 1970, US-64 was relocated across the Arkansas River between Webber Falls and Gore. Between then and 1972, US-64 was realigned between Enid and Perry, with the old highway becoming SH-164. By 1974, the majority of the freeway that US-64 was to occupy in Tulsa was complete, and it was relocated onto the completed portion of the freeway. Only the portion in the downtown section of the city was yet to be completed. The remainder of the freeway, the concurrency with Interstate 444, was not completed until about 1983. The next and final major modification to the designation of US-64 took place when it was moved from its route through eastern Tulsa onto the newly constructed Creek Turnpike over the first half of 1992. The route has undergone only minor changes since then. The section of US-64 between Webbers Falls and Gore was pressed into service as a detour for I-40 traffic after the collapse of its bridge over the Arkansas River on May 26, 2002. The detour significantly impacted the town of Gore. Local firefighters directed traffic there 24 hours a day, with daytime temperatures approaching . Businesses in Gore reported loss of revenue due to the traffic; one gas station reported a 30% decline in revenue while traffic was detoured through town. Delays of thirty to fifty minutes on the detour were typical, although trains passing through Gore could lengthen wait times by 15 minutes. Spurs Near the east end of its route through Oklahoma, US-64 currently connects to two short highways, bearing the number \\"64\\" with a letter suffix, branching off from the interstate to connect the highway to other roads. Both of these highways lie entirely within Sequoyah County and connect US-64 to I-40. In the past, US-64 also connected to a short spur highway in Perry. SH-64A State Highway 64A began at I-35 exit 186 and extended east into Perry for approximately . SH-64A first appeared on the official state highway map in 1965, though it was not labeled as SH-64A until the 1966 edition. When US-64 was realigned around 1971, US-64 was realigned to follow SH-64A through Perry. The SH-64A designation was retired at this time. SH-64B State Highway 64B begins at I-40 exit 321 in Muldrow and heads north along Main Street, connecting with US-64 north of the interstate. From here, the highway continues north along Main Street through downtown Muldrow. After passing through downtown, SH-64B leaves the city limits and proceeds north to unincorporated Long. North of Long, it comes to its northern terminus at SH-101. SH-64B's total length is . SH-64B first appeared on the 1959 state highway map as a gravel highway. By 1962, the southern half of the highway had been paved. The remainder of the highway was paved by the following year. SH-64C State Highway 64C was a short state highway in Sequoyah County that existed briefly in the early 1970s. SH-64C began at SH-64B north of Muldrow. From here, it proceeded southeast in a stairstep fashion, using a mix of gravel and paved roads, to Roland. From Roland, it continued south, crossing I-40 and coming to its eastern terminus at US-64. Its length was . SH-64C first appeared on the 1974 state highway map. By the following year, the portion of highway between downtown Roland and US-64 had been removed from the state highway system, bringing its length down to . It had been removed from the state highway system in its entirety by 1976. SH-64D State Highway 64D is a highway beginning at US-64 in Moffett, running parallel to the Oklahoma‚ÄìArkansas state line to its northern terminus at I-40 exit 330 just west of Dora, Arkansas. SH-64D is long. SH-64D first appeared on the 1974 state map. At that time, the highway had a gravel road surface. By the next year, it had been paved in its entirety.

It is loosely based on the adventure gamebook of the same name (the first in the Fighting Fantasy series) written by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone, and published by Puffin Books in 1982. The game was sold both as a regular cassette-only release, and (at a higher price) as a \\"software pack\\" edition that included a copy of the original Fighting Fantasy title. Gameplay As a third-person arcade adventure game, the player takes the role of an adventurer on a quest to find the treasure of a powerful warlock, hidden deep within Firetop Mountain. The treasure is stored in a chest with fifteen locks, with the keys guarded by various monsters (e.g. orcs, slime moulds and spiders) in the dungeons of Firetop Mountain. The adventurer (equipped with a bow and a sword) must attempt to retrieve the keys, with an added feature (over the game's predecessor, Halls of the Things) being the ability to open and close doors to block the path of pursuing monsters. Gameplay varies with each new game as the maze is randomly generated. Development The Warlock of Firetop Mountain was announced in issue two of Micro Adventurer magazine, which published a feature on the expansion of Penguin Books children's imprint Puffin into the science fiction software market with the video game The Warlock of Firetop Mountain, hoping to emulate the success of the book title.Penguin Launches into SF Software, Micro Adventurer, issue 2, p.7, Sunshine Books, December 1983 The game was announced as the first in the \\"Puffin Personal Computer Collection\\"Puffin advertisement for the four launch titles of the new range.

Early 20th century In 1900 the Catholic population was 10 million, under the control of 14 Archbishops, 77 bishops, and 12,000 priests. The community had built 10,000 churches, of which two-thirds had resident pastors. Catholic schools educated nearly 1,000,000 children and youth. Catholics were heavily concentrated in the industrial and mining centers of the Northeast; few were farmers and only a small fraction lived in the South, chiefly in Louisiana. Catholics comprised less than one in 7 of the national population of 76 million.Thomas T. McAvoy, \\"The Catholic Minority after the Americanist Controversy, 1899-1917: A Survey,\\" Review of Politics (1959) 21#1 pp. 53-82, at p 59 in JSTOR National Catholic War Council It was John J. Burke, editor of the Catholic World, who first recognized the urgency of the moment. Burke had long argued for a national outlook and sense of unity among the country's Catholics. The war provided the impetus to initiate these efforts. The Catholic hierarchy was eager to show its enthusiastic support for the war effort. In order to better address challenges posed by World War I, the American Catholic hierarchy in 1917 chose to meet collectively for the first time since 1884. In August 1917, on the campus of The Catholic University of America in Washington, Burke, with the backing of Cardinal Gibbons and other bishops, convened a meeting to discuss organizing a national agency to coordinate the war effort of the American Catholic community. One hundred and fifteen delegates from sixty-eight dioceses, together with members from the Catholic press and representatives from twenty-seven national Catholic organizations attended this first meeting. It set up the National Catholic War Council, \\"to study, coordinate, unify and put in operation all Catholic activities incidental to the war.\\" An executive committee, chaired by Cardinal George Mundelein of Chicago, was formed in December 1917, to oversee the work of the Council. The mandate of the newly formed organization included the promotion of Catholic participation in the war, through chaplains, literature, and care for the morale of the troops, as well as (for the first time) lobbying for Catholic interests in the nation's capital.National Catholic War Council, Handbook of the National Catholic War council (1918) online As the war ended liberals hoped that a new commitment to social reform would characterize the ensuing peace. The Council saw an opportunity to use its national voice to shape reform and in April 1918 created a Committee for Reconstruction. John A. Ryan wrote the \\"Bishops' Program of Social Reconstruction.\\" It was issued to the public on February 12, 1919, through a carefully planned public relations campaign. The plan offered a guide for overhauling America's politics, society, and economy based on Pope Leo XIII's Rerum novarum and a variety of influences reflecting the Progressive Era in the U.S.. The Program received a mixed reception both within the Church and outside it. The National Catholic War Council was a voluntary organization with no canonical status. Its ability to speak authoritatively was thus questioned. Many bishops threw their support behind the Program, while Bishop William Turner of Buffalo and William Henry O'Connell of Boston, among others, opposed it. O'Connell believed some aspects of the plan smacked too much of socialism. Response outside the Church was also divided: labor organizations backing it, for example, and business groups criticizing it. Threats to parochial schools After World War I, some states concerned about the influence of immigrants and \\"foreign\\" values looked to public schools for help. The states drafted lawsdesigned to use schools to promote a common American culture. In 1921, the Ku Klux Klan attracted as many as 14,000 members in Oregon, establishing 58 klaverns by the end of 1922. Given the small population of non-white minorities outside Portland, the Oregon Klan directed its attention almost exclusively against Catholics, who numbered about 8% of the population. In 1922, the Masonic Grand Lodge of Oregon sponsored a bill to require all school-age children to attend public schools. With support of the Klan and Democratic Governor Walter M. Pierce, endorsed by the Klan, the Compulsory Education Act was passed by a vote of 115,506 to 103,685. Its primary purpose was to shut down Catholic schools in Oregon, but it also affected other private and military schools. The constitutionality of the law was challenged in court and ultimately struck down by the Supreme Court in Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925) before it went into effect.Howard, J. Paul. \\"Cross-Border Reflections, Parents‚Äô Right to Direct Their Childrens‚Äô Education Under the U.S. and Canadian Constitutions\\" , Education Canada, v41 n2 p36-37 Sum 2001. The law caused outraged Catholics to organize locally and nationally for the right to send their children to Catholic schools. In Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925), the United States Supreme Court declared the Oregon's Compulsory Education Act unconstitutional in a ruling that has been called \\"the Magna Carta of the parochial school system.\\" The Catholic leadership in 1924 mobilized to defeat a constitutional amendment that, they feared, would mean not just federal control of child labor, but also would be the opening wedge for federal invasion of individual and parental rights, that would threaten parochial schools. Many church leaders had also opposed woman suffrage. When it passed in 1920 they called upon Catholic women to start voting. Most of the Catholic women actually started to vote in 1928, when there was a Catholic on the presidential ticket.James Hennessy, American Catholics: A history of the Roman Catholic community in the United States (1981) pp 233-4 1928 Presidential election Al Smith In 1928, Al Smith became the first Roman Catholic to gain a major party's nomination for president, and his religion became an issue during the campaign. Many Protestants feared that Smith would take orders from church leaders in Rome in making decisions affecting the country. Smith was from New York City, with strong ties to the Democratic machine known as Tammany Hall. To top it off, he was a wet who strongly opposed national prohibition.Edmund Arthur Moore, A Catholic Runs for President (1956) National Catholic Welfare Conference The National Catholic Welfare Council (NCWC) began in 1919 as the annual meeting of the American Catholic hierarchy and its standing secretariat. It consists of a staff of clergy as well as committees of bishops who discussed and sometimes issued statements on matters of national policy such as education, welfare, and health care. It split into the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and the United States Catholic Conference. Today it is the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB). Parochial schools In 1900, the Church supported 3,500 parochial schools, usually under the control of the local parish. By 1920, the number of elementary schools had reached 6,551, enrolling 1,759, 673 pupils taught by 41, 581 teachers. Secondary education likewise boomed. In 1900, there were only about 100 Catholic high schools, but by 1920 more than 1,500 were in operation. For more than two generations, enrollment continued to climb. The Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities was founded in 1899, In 1904, Catholic educators formed an organization to coordinate their efforts on a national scale: the Catholic Educational Association which later changed its name to the National Catholic Educational Association. Polish Catholic parish schools Polish Americans boosted membership in the Catholic church and expanded parishes previously non-existent in the Midwestern United States. Student enrollment had increased significantly in the interwar period and many young Polish women were requested to teach in the schools. Polish-born nuns were strongly desired for educating the students. A study in 1932 found that close to 300,000 Polish Americans were enrolled in over 600 Polish grade schools in the United States. Very few of the Polish Americans who graduated from grade school at the time pursued high school or college at that time. High School was not required and enrollment across the United States was far lower at the time. Polish Americans took to the Catholic private schools in great numbers. In Chicago, 35,862 students (60 percent of the Polish population) attended Polish parochial schools in 1920. Nearly every Polish parish in the American Catholic Church had a school, whereas in Italian parishes, it was typically one in ten parishes. Even as late as 1960, estimates of Chicago's students attending Polish parochial schools was about 60% of the Polish American population. Supreme Court upholds parochial schools In 1922, the voters of Oregon passed an initiative amending Oregon Law Section 5259, the Compulsory Education Act. The law unofficially became known as the Oregon School Law. The citizens' initiative was primarily aimed at eliminating parochial schools, including Catholic schools. The law caused outraged Catholics to organize locally and nationally for the right to send their children to Catholic schools. In Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925), the United States Supreme Court declared the Oregon's Compulsory Education Act unconstitutional in a ruling that has been called \\"the Magna Carta of the parochial school system.\\" Peak By the mid-1960s, enrollment in Catholic parochial schools had reached an all-time high of 4.5 million elementary school pupils, with about 1 million students in Catholic high schools. The enrollments steadily declined as Catholics moved to the suburbs, where the children attended public schools.Andrew M. Greeley, et al. Catholic Schools and a Declining Church (1976) ch 2 Mid-20th century Catholic Worker Movement The Catholic Worker movement began as a means to combine Dorothy Day's history in American social activism, anarchism, and pacifism with the tenets of Catholicism (including a strong current of distributism), five years after her 1927 conversion.\\"\\"Dorothy Day, Prophet of Pacifism for the Catholic Church\\" \\" from \\"Houston Catholic Worker\\" newspaper, October 1997 The group started with the Catholic Worker magazine that staked out a neutral, pacifist position in the war-torn 1930s. This grew into a \\"house of hospitality\\" in the slums of New York City and then a series of farms for people to live together communally. The movement quickly spread to other cities in the United States, and to Canada and Britain. 1930s Historian John McGreevey notes: \\"Priests across the country in the 1930s encouraged their parishioners to join unions, and some like Pittsburgh's Charles Rice, Detroit's Frederick Siedenberg, and Buffalo's Monsignor John P.Boland, served on regional labor boards and played key roles in workplace negotiations.\\" The Catholic Worker Movement and Dorothy Day grew out of the same impetuses to put Catholic social teaching into action. Catholic Conference on Industrial Problems The Catholic Conference on Industrial Problems (1923‚Äì1937) was conceived by Fr. Raymond McGowan as a way of bringing together Catholic leaders in the fields of theology, labor, and business, with a view to promoting awareness and discussion of Catholic social teaching. Its first meeting was held in Milwaukee. While it was the venue for important discussions during its existence, its demise was due in part to lack of participation by business executives who perceived the dominant tone of the group as anti-business. 1960s John F. Kennedy, 35th President of the United States The 1960s marked a profound transformation of the Catholic Church in the United States.Mark S. Massa, The American Catholic Revolution: How the Sixties Changed the Church Forever (2010) online Religion became a divisive issue during the presidential campaign of 1960. Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts was vying to become the nation's first Catholic president, Using his base of support among urban Catholics. A key factor that was hurting Kennedy in his campaign was the widespread prejudice against his Roman Catholic religion; some Protestants believed that, if he were elected president, Kennedy would have to take orders from the pope in Rome. When offered the opportunity to speak before a convention of Baptist ministers, decided to try to put the issue to rest. To address fears that his Roman Catholicism would impact his decision-making, John F. Kennedy famously told the Greater Houston Ministerial Association on September 12, 1960, \\"I am not the Catholic candidate for President. I am the Democratic Party's candidate for President who also happens to be a Catholic. I do not speak for my Church on public matters ‚Äî and the Church does not speak for me.\\" He promised to respect the separation of church and state and not to allow Catholic officials to dictate public policy to him. Kennedy also raised the question of whether one-quarter of Americans were relegated to second-class citizenship just because they were Roman Catholic. Even so, it was widely believed after the election that Kennedy lost some heavily Protestant states because of his Catholicism. His address did not please everyone: many non-Catholics remained unconvinced that a Catholic could be president without divided loyalties; and many Catholics thought he conceded too much in his profession of belief in an \\"absolute\\" separation of church and state. The speech is widely considered to be an important marker in the history of Catholicism (and anti-Catholicism) in the United States. Kennedy went on to win the national popular vote over Richard Nixon by just one tenth of one percentage point (0.1%) - the closest popular-vote margin of the 20th century. In the electoral college, Kennedy's victory was larger, as he took 303 electoral votes to Nixon's 219 (269 were needed to win). The New York Times, summarizing the discussion late in November, spoke of a \\"narrow consensus\\" among the experts that Kennedy had won more than he lost as a result of his Catholicism,New York Times, November 20, 1960, Section 4, p. E5 as Northern Catholics flocked to Kennedy because of attacks on his religion. 1970s On January 22, 1973, the Supreme Court of the United States announced its decision in the Roe v. Wade case, finding that a constitutional right to privacy prohibited interference with a woman's 'right' to an abortion. The Catholic Church was one of the few institutional voices opposing the decision at the time, leading to the abortion issue being construed then and since largely as a religious one. Although a majority of Catholics have agreed with the hierarchy in their insistence on legal protection of the unborn, some‚Äîincluding prominent politicians‚Äîhave not, leading to perennial controversies concerning the responsibilities of Catholics in American public life. Late 20th century  1980s  Sanctuary of refugees from Central American civil wars was a movement in the 1980s. It was part of a broader anti-war movement positioned against U.S. foreign policy in Central America. By 1987, 440 sites in the United States had been declared \\"sanctuary congregations\\" or \\"sanctuary cities\\" open to migrants from the civil wars in El Salvador and Guatemala. These sites included university campuses. The movement originated along the U.S. border with Mexico in Arizona but was also strong in Chicago, Philadelphia, and California. In 1981, Rev. John Fife and Jim Corbett, among others, began bringing Central American refugees into the United States. It was their intent to offer sanctuary, or faith-based protection, from the political violence that was taking place in El Salvador and Guatemala.See James P. Carroll, 2006: \\"Sanctuary\\", in House of War, pp. 397-404. The Department of Justice indicted several activists in south Texas for assisting refugees. Later 16 activists in Arizona were indicted, including Fife and Corbett in 1985; 11 were brought to trial and 8 were convicted of alien smuggling and other charges. The defendants claimed their actions were justifiable to save lives of people who would be killed and had no other way to escape. This movement has been succeeded in the 2000s by the movement of churches and other houses of worship, to shelter immigrants in danger of deportation. The New Sanctuary Movement is a network of houses of worship that facilitates this effort. Abuse affairs in the later 20th century In the later 20th century \\"[...] the Catholic Church in the United States became the subject of controversy due to allegations of clerical child abuse of children and adolescents, of episcopal negligence in arresting these crimes, and of numerous civil suits that cost Catholic dioceses hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.\\"Patrick W. Carey, Catholics in America. A History, Westport, Connecticut and London: Praeger, 2004, p. 141 Although evidence of such abuse was uncovered in other countries, the vast majority of sex abuse cases occurred in the United States.1,200 Priests Reported Accused of Abuse Article from AP Online One estimate suggested that up to 3% of U.S. priests were involved.Grossman, Cathy Lynn. \\"Survey: More clergy abuse cases than previously thought.\\" USA Today (February 10, 2004). Retrieved July 21, 2007 The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops commissioned a comprehensive study that found that four percent of all priests who served in the US from 1950 to 2002 faced some sort of sexual accusation. Some priests resigned, others were defrocked and jailed, and there were financial settlements with many victims. The Church was widely criticized when it emerged that some bishops had known about abuse allegations, and reassigned accused priests after first sending them to psychiatric counseling.Steinfels, p. 40‚Äì46.Frawley-ODea, p. 4. Some bishops and psychiatrists contended that the prevailing psychology of the times suggested that people could be cured of such behavior through counseling. Pope John Paul II responded by declaring that \\"there is no place in the priesthood and religious life for those who would harm the young\\".Walsh, p. 62. Major lawsuits emerged in 2001 and subsequent years claiming some priests had sexually abused minors.Bruni, p. 336. These allegations of priests sexually abusing children were widely reported in the news media. Some commentators, such as journalist Jon Dougherty, have argued that media coverage of the issue has been excessive, given that the same problems plague other institutions, such as the US public school system, with much greater frequency.

OutStart‚Äôs social business software and learning systems automate the development, maintenance, and delivery of modular and personalized training. According to the company, its social software technologies enable the capture of a historical knowledge base of insights, experiences, ideas and content accessible by anyone, at any time. John Alonso, Michelle Bruce and Scott Edwards founded OutStart in 1999; the company was incorporated in July 1999. In 2012, Kenexa, a publicly listed business solutions provider, acquired OutStart for an undisclosed amount. History Alonso and Edwards met in the mid 1990s while working at Powersoft Corporation, which was acquired by Sybase in 1994. While at Powersoft, and later Sybase‚Äôs Education division, Alonso held a number of roles over several years, including as an instructor for the PowerBuilder product; building computer- and video-based training; and, eventually, creating content. Edwards served as both a programmer and consultant alongside Alonso. As a trainer at Sybase, Alonso says he noticed that most customers rarely availed themselves of all the instructor-led training made available by Sybase. Alonso proposed to his managers that they offer training curriculum online, which he called next-generation learning. Company executives liked the idea and gave Alonso the directive to proceed with his plan of developing an internally used Learning content management system (LCMS). According to Alonso, the software was among the first LCMS developed for either ‚Äúan internal or external audience of learners.‚Äù Other LCMS on the market and in use at the time elsewhere included software sold by Generation21 and Peer3, respectively. In 1998, Sybase hired Michelle Bruce as an instructor for the Southeast U.S. She had a background in education and soon became part of Alonso‚Äôs team. Eventually, Alonso left Sybase, followed by Edwards and Bruce. After leaving Sybase, Alonso, Bruce and Edwards teamed up to found OutStart. Initially, the company‚Äôs headquarters was near Orlando, Florida. According to its founders, OutStart‚Äôs name sprung from the desire ‚Äúto help companies outsource their training and in so doing jump-start their programs.‚Äù The company has been positioned by Gartner, Inc. in the ‚Äúvisionaries‚Äù quadrant of the 2008 and 2009 ‚ÄúCorporate Learning Systems Magic Quadrant‚Äú. In February 2012, OutStart was acquired by Kenexa, a human resources and talent management company. Kenexa bought the company for an undisclosed amount to integrate OutStart's SaaS-based social and mobile learning solutions with its talent management services. Later that year, in April 2012, IBM acquired Kenexa for $1.3 billion. Mergers and acquisitions In July 2002, OutStart acquired Concentric Visions Inc., a developer of enterprise-class content management software. In October 2002, OutStart acquired Trainersoft.com Corp, a maker of e-learning tools. In November 2004, OutStart acquired Chicago-based Participate Systems Inc., a maker of social business software. In July 2008, OutStart merged with Eedo Knowledgeware Corporation, a provider of learning and knowledge management software.

He was selected in the seventh round of the 2006 Major League Baseball draft by the Cincinnati Reds, and made his major league debut in 2009. He has previously played for the Baltimore Orioles and New York Mets. Turner also has experience playing second base, shortstop, and first base. Early life Justin Turner was born in Long Beach, California, to John and Betsy Turner. He has one younger sister. Turner attended Mayfair High School in Lakewood, California, earning three-time All-Suburban first team honors as a shortstop and second baseman. He hit .514 in league play as a senior, earning most valuable player honors en route to a league title. He attended California State University, Fullerton, where he majored in kinesiology and played college baseball for the Titans. He earned freshman All-American honors from Baseball America in 2003 after quickly taking over as the starting second baseman. He was named to the 2003 College World Series all-tournament team as a shortstop. Many CWS fans that year remember him as the player who was hit in the face by a fastball after going 3 for 3 including a HR. The next year, Cal State Fullerton won a two-game final over Texas in the 2004 College World Series. In 2005, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox. Turner was selected in the 29th round of the 2005 Major League Baseball draft by the New York Yankees, but he did not sign. He was selected in the seventh round (204th overall) of the 2006 Major League Baseball draft by the Cincinnati Reds, receiving a $50,000 bonus upon signing with the organization. Professional career Cincinnati Reds Turner reported to the Reds' Rookie League affiliate, the Billings Mustangs, where he saw time at all four infield positions and in the outfield, finishing the season with a team-leading .338 batting average and a .921 OPS. He was promoted to Double-A Chattanooga within two years, finishing the 2008 season, at age 23, with a .289 average and a .792 OPS at that level. Baltimore Orioles 2009-10 On December 9, 2008, during the Winter Meetings, Turner was traded along with utility player Ryan Freel and infielder Brandon Waring to the Baltimore Orioles, in return for catcher Ram√≥n Hern√°ndez. He was invited to spring training as a non-roster invitee; upon its conclusion, he was assigned to Triple-A Norfolk for the 2009 season. Playing mostly second and third base, he finished the year with a .300 average and a .749 OPS. The Orioles purchased Turner's contract on September 8, 2009. He made his major league debut that day at Fenway Park, pinch hitting for Melvin Mora and finishing the game at third base. Three days later, he got his first major league hit at Yankee Stadium, a single to center field off Michael Dunn. He finished the season 3-18, having appeared in 12 games, three of them starts (all at third base). Turner was invited to spring training as a member of the 40-man roster, but was demoted to Norfolk at the end of camp. However, on April 12, 2010, the Orioles placed starting second baseman Brian Roberts on the 15-day injured list and recalled Turner from Norfolk. On May 21, 2010, Turner was designated for assignment by the Baltimore Orioles. In 17 games with the Orioles, he hit .111 (3 hits in 27 at-bats). New York Mets 2010-2013 2011 New York Mets On May 25, 2010, Turner was claimed off waivers from the Orioles by the New York Mets and optioned to Triple-A Buffalo. On June 16, Turner was called up to the Mets, with Nick Evans being sent down to Buffalo. After designating Brad Emaus for assignment on April 19, 2011, the Mets called Turner back up. He hit his first major league home run against the Houston Astros on May 15, 2011, off Aneury Rodriguez. A three-run home run, it capped off a 5-RBI day for Turner. On May 21, in a Subway Series game at Yankee Stadium, Turner collected an RBI in his 7th consecutive game, setting a Mets rookie record for most consecutive games with an RBI. With this record and other impressive stats, Turner was named the NL Rookie of the Month for May 2011. He was the first Met to win the award since its creation in 2001. In 2012, the Mets converted him to an all-around utility infielder but on May 6, 2012, when shortstop Ruben Tejada went on the injured list Turner began platooning at shortstop with Jordany Valdespin until Tejada returned. After the 2013 season, Turner was non-tendered by the Mets, making him a free agent. In 301 games with the Mets over four seasons, he hit .265. Los Angeles Dodgers 2015 Los Angeles Dodgers Following his release from the Mets, Turner had not yet found a new employer when Los Angeles Dodgers bench coach Tim Wallach saw Turner hitting at a Cal State Fullerton Alumni game. Turner signed a minor league contract with the Dodgers on February 5, 2014, with an invitation to spring training. His contract was purchased by the Dodgers on March 16 and he was added to the Major League roster. 2014 Turner had a breakout season in 2014, playing 109 games due to his versatility and injuries to both Hanley Ram√≠rez and Juan Uribe. Turner led the team with a .340 batting average, hitting 7 home runs with 43 RBI in 288 at bats. 2015 On January 16, 2015, he signed a one-year, $2.5 million contract with the Dodgers, avoiding salary arbitration. He became the starting third baseman for much of the 2015 season and hit .294 with a career high 16 homers and 60 RBI. In the 2015 National League Division Series against his former team the Mets, Turner led the Dodgers with 10 hits in 19 ABs for a .526 average, with an LDS record 6 of those hits being doubles. After the Dodgers were eliminated from the post-season, he underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee. He signed a new one year, $5.1 million, contract with the Dodgers in order to avoid salary arbitration in January 2016. 2016 In 2016, Turner played in a career-high 151 games, and also had career highs in home runs (27) and RBI (90), while batting .275. He had six hits (including a home run) in 15 at-bats in the 2016 National League Division Series, but struggled in the 2016 National League Championship Series, hitting only .200. 2017 2017 Los Angeles Dodgers #10 Justin Turner World Series road jersey On December 23, 2016, the Dodgers signed Turner to a four-year contract valued at $64 million. Turner started the 2017 season batting .379 before going on the injured list with a strained right hamstring, which kept him out of action from May 18 through June 9. On July 6, he won the All-Star Final Vote, earning a spot in the 2017 Major League Baseball All-Star Game with 20.8 million votes, a Final Vote record. Turner finished the season with a .322 batting average, a .415 on-base percentage, 21 home runs, and 71 RBI, finishing third in the NL in batting average and second in on-base percentage. In the 2017 NLDS, he had six hits in 13 at-bats (.462 average), including a winning home run in the ninth inning of Game 2 against the Chicago Cubs. Turner and Chris Taylor were selected as the co-MVPs of the 2017 National League Championship Series, where he batted .333 with two home runs and seven RBI. However, in the 2017 World Series, he had only four hits in 25 at-bats, for a .160 average as the Dodgers lost to the Houston Astros in seven games. Turner broke Dusty Baker's franchise record for most RBI in a single post- season when he drove in his 14th run in Game One of the World Series. 2018 Turner was hit by a pitch on his left wrist during a spring training game on March 19, 2018. He suffered a non-displaced fracture, which did not require surgery but put him on the injured list to begin the season. He did not rejoin the Dodgers until May 15. Turner also missed time following the All-Star break, but rebounded in August and September. He was voted the National League Player of the Month for August after batting .402 (39-for-97) with 22 runs, 11 doubles, 1 triple, 6 home runs, 20 RBIs and a stolen base across 25 August games. On September 4, 2018 Turner was named the Los Angeles Dodgers' 2018 nominee for the Roberto Clemente Award, an annual award given to the player who \\"best exemplifies the game of baseball, sportsmanship, and community involvement.\\" In 202 at-bats after the All-Star break, Turner hit .356 with a 1.066 OPS, 24 doubles and 9 home runs. Turner would finish the season with a .312 batting average, 14 home runs and 52 RBIs. Turner's hot streak continued in the 2018 NLDS, where he reached base in 9 of 18 plate appearances.

According to the Hwarang Segi, she was concubine to several kings and, along with his mother Queen Sado, played an instrumental role in dethroning King Jinji. Biography According to the Hwarang Segi, Mishil was the daughter of Lord Mijinbu and Lady Myodo and sister of Queen Mother Sado, the consort of Jinheung of Silla. Her paternal grandmother was Princess Samyeop, daughter of King Beopheung. Due to her lineage, Mishil was a member of the jingol (ÏßÑÍ≥®, ÁúûÈ™®), or the noble true bone caste. Matrilineally, she belonged to the Matrilineal clan of Daewon Shintong (ÎåÄÏõêÏã†ÌÜµ, Â§ßÂÖÉÁ•ûÁµ±) or directly translated as the divine succession of the great prime. The divine succession of the great prime is believed to be descent from Bomi, however, the records in the reigns of Soji of Silla, that Bomi, the Lady Daewon (Â§ßÂÖÉÂ§´‰∫∫Ôºâ,passed away at age 82 and buried at the age of 82. Lady Daewon has given birth to 12 children from several different fathers. Because of her nobility, her descedents were known as Daewon or great prime tribe.

She was concubine to three successive Silla kings: King Jinheung, King Jinji, and King Jinpyeong. Legend states that she was in love with Crown Prince Dongnyeon. Her sons became the 11th and 16th pungwoljus, Bojong (through Seolwon) and Hajong (through Sejong), respectively. According to Hwarang Segi: Mishil became King Jinji's concubine after his father, King Jinheung died. However, he lost interest on her after falling in love with another woman. His mother, Queen Sado, was angered about his sudden change of heart and failing to keep his promise on making her sister, Mishil into his Queen. As a result, Queen Sado, with the help of Mishil's lovers; Lord Sejong and General Seolwon, managed to get the support of the court to dethrone King Jinji. They gained people's support after blaming him for the starvation and defeat that Silla has suffered by spreading the rumor that heavens has forsaken Silla for having an immoral king. Jinji's removal resulted in the installation of his nephew, King Jinpyeong, to the throne. Jinji's grandson, Kim Chunchu, would later succeed to the throne as King Muyeol. Historicity It has been questioned whether Misil was truly a historical figure, as she is only mentioned in the Hwarang Segi, and not in the historical texts Samguk sagi or Samguk yusa. Additionally, her role as mother to her various sons and daughters is not acknowledged by either of these historical texts, only the Hwarang Segi.

Early Light International (Holdings) Limited is the holding company of Early Light Industrial and was founded in 1994.Bloomberg Businessweek (29 May 2011). Early Light International (Holdings) Limited - Company overview The company is based in Sheung Shui, Hong Kong. Early Light is a private company that specialises as an original equipment manufacturer and original design manufacturer of toys and consumer products for nearly 40 years. Product lines manufactured include products marketed to adults and children and range from simple moulded figurines to highly sophisticated electronic robots. Headquartered in Hong Kong with manufacturing facilities situated in Shenzhen and Shaoguan, Early Light Industrial was one of the first to relocate manufacturing facilities across the border to China from Hong Kong in 1983, hiring 3000 workers. After hiring locally in an effort to employ relocated ethnic workers, Early Light Industrial employs more than 80,000 people working in Hong Kong and in its plants in neighbouring Guangdong.\\"Choi‚Äôs Toys\\". Forbes. Since its inception, Early Light Industrial has developed relationships with major toy sellers such as Mattel, Lionel, and Hasbro,Partners , Early Light Industrial Co., Ltd. and has grown to an organisation that employs over 70,000 employees during peak production periods in factories that total more than 20 million square feet. Stating a concern for the environment and sustainable manufacturing, Early Light Industrial contributes to local social causes, charitable organisations, and community organisations in addition to earning ISO certifications that highlight the company‚Äôs dedication to the future of manufacturing.  Manufacturing facilities   History  In 1972, the first factory was located in the Kwun Tong industrial area of Hong Kong. In 1984, the Xinn√°n factory was opened across the border in Shenzhen, with 500 employees. In 1991, Woha factory of and 10,000 employees is opened in Shenzhen, Guangdong. In 1994, Renwu factory in Shenzhen; plant of and 12,000 employees. In 1997,establishes the Shanha factory in Shenzhen with 10,000 employees. These plants were certified ISO9001:2000 in 1999. In 2006, opens factory located in Wujiang District of Shaoguan; plant employing 8,000 staff.  Today  Early Light Industrial Co., Limited operates two manufacturing facilities, one in Shenzhen and one in Shaoguan. Combined, these facilities cover an area of approximately 25 million square feet, and have the capacity to accommodate over 450 assembly lines and 70,000 skilled workers at their peak. Early Light Industrial‚Äôs Shaoguan factory, located in Wujiang District, employs some 20,000 workers. In 2010, its plants are awarded ISO9001:2008. In addition to in-house capacity, Early Light Industrial solicited contractors to produce more than 40% of its products, as at 2006. To better control manufacturing process and quality, Early Light Industrial has progressively reduced its dependence on sub-contractors to less than 25%. The company declared that it intends to eliminate the need for sub contractors altogether and handle all of its production in house, under one roof.  2007 Mattel recall  In 2007, toy cars supplied to Mattel by Early Light were subject to a HK$1 million product recall when they were found to contain lead. It was subsequently discovered that the source of lead was the unauthorised paint used by one of its subcontractors. An Early Light spokesman said at the time: \\"We discovered [the subcontractor] didn't turn up to fetch the paint in April and May, so we did a lab test on the toy cars. We reported to Mattel when we saw there were problems.\\" Mattel absolved Early Light from blame caused by the substitution of dangerous paint by the subcontractor, Hong Li Da.  Staff relations  According to the company, Early Light Industrial ensures the welfare of its employees by managing factories in compliance with the CARE process of the International Council of Toy Industries (ICTI); it contributes to local relief funds during times of crisis and research and social development foundations. Nevertheless, the company's Shaoguan factory became the focus of world attention when it was the centre of a factory brawl which, according to official sources, killed 2 and injured 118 people, most of which Uyghurs, and which has been widely cited as the incident which resulted in street protests, and subsequently riots, in the Xinjiang capital of √úr√ºmqi in July 2009. The factory, located in Wujiang District, employs some 16,000 workers. At the behest of the Guangdong authorities, it hired 800 workers from Kashgar, as part of an ethnic program which relocated 200,000 young Uyghurs since the start of 2008. In a report about the company's Shenzhen factory in 2008, China Labor Watch alleged that workers at the Shaoguan factory, where the Uyghurs were employed, earned 28 yuan per day compared with 41.3 yuan in its factory in Shenzhen. Li Qiang, the executive director of China Labor Watch said the low pay, long hours and poor working conditions combined with the inability of Uyghur workers to communicate with their Han colleagues exacerbated deeply held mistrust between the groups, and sparked the deadly brawl in June 2009.

The first models, the S-810/10 and S-810/20, were announced in August 1982, making the S-810 was the second of the first three Japanese supercomputers, following the Fujitsu VP-200, which was announced July 1982, but predating the NEC SX-2, which was announced in April 1983. The S-810 was Hitachi's first supercomputer, although the company had previously built a vector processor, the IAP. The first system shipped was a top-end S-810/20 model, which was delivered to the University of Tokyo's Large Computer Center in October 1983. The S-810 was succeeded as Hitachi's top-end supercomputer by the HITAC S-820 announced in July 1987. There were three models, the low-end S-810/5, the mid-range S-810/10, and the top-end S-810/20. They differ in the number of vector pipelines installed, the number of scalar registers, the number vector registers, and the amount of memory supported. Hitachi claimed that the S-810/5's peak performance was 160 MFLOPS, the S-810/10's was 315 MFLOPS, and the S-810/20's was 630 MFLOPS. The S-810 implements a Hitachi- designed extension of the IBM System/370 instruction set architecture with 83 vector instructions (80 in the S-810/5 and S-810/10). The vector instructions are register-to-register, meaning that they do not directly reference memory. The scalar processor is a Hitachi HITAC M-280H mainframe with a 28 nanosecond (ns) cycle time (clock rate of approximately 35.71 MHz). In the S-810/20, there are 32 scalar registers, whereas the other models have 16. In all models, the scalar processor has a large 256 kilobyte cache. The vector processor has a 14 ns cycle time (clock rate of approximately 71.43 MHz). The vector registers are 256 elements wide, and each element is 64 bits wide. The S-810/20 has 32 of these registers, whereas the other models have 16. These registers are implemented with 1 kilobit (Kbit) bipolar RAM integrated circuits (ICs) with a 4.5 ns access time. All models have eight 256-bit vector mask registers and 48 vector address registers. All models have three load pipelines and one load/store pipeline for accessing the main memory. The S-810/20 has two lanes, each with two add, one multiply followed by add, and one multiply or divide followed by add floating point pipelines, for a total of twelve. The S-810/10 has one lane with the same configuration as the S-810/20 and therefore a total of six pipelines. CPU logic is implemented with two emitter-coupled logic gate array IC types, a 550-gate part with a 250 picosecond (ps) gate delay and a 1,500-gate part with a 450 ps gate delay. The main memory is implemented with 16 Kbit complementary metal-oxide- semiconductor static random access memory ICs with an access time of 40 ns. The S-810/20 supports 64 to 256 megabyte (MB) of main memory, whereas the other models support 32 to 128 MB. References * http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/computer/super/0007.html  R.W. Hockney; C.R.

The company was most likely best known for its open source software suite ROS (Robot Operating System), which has been rapidly and widely becoming a common, standard tool among robotics researchers and industry, since its initial release in 2010. It was started in late 2006 by Scott Hassan, who had worked with Larry Page and Sergey Brin to develop the technology that became the Google Search engine. Steve Cousins was the president and CEO. Willow Garage was located in Menlo Park, California. Willow Garage shut down in early 2014. Most employees were retained by Suitable Technologies, Inc, while the support and services responsibilities were transferred to Clearpath Robotics.https://www.willowgarage.com/blog History Willow Garage hired its first employees in January 2007, Jonathan Stark, Melonee Wise, Curt Meyers, and John Hsu. All four were recruited by Scott Hassan to work on Willow Garage's first projects which included an SUV entrant into the DARPA Grand Challenge and an autonomous solar powered boat for deploying scientific payloads in open oceans. In the Fall of 2008, Eric Berger and Keenan Wyrobek pitched Willow Garage on creating a common hardware (PR1) and software (ROS) platforms and the idea of creating a Personal Robotics Program at Willow Garage. They had previously started the Stanford Personal Robotics Program to build the platform technologies that would enable the personal robotics industry. At Willow Garage they led the development of PR2, the common hardware platform for robotics R&D;, and ROS, the open source robotics middleware. The teams from the DARPA car program and the autonomous boat program were eventually rolled into the Personal Robotics Program, which by the end of 2008, became the focus of Willow Garage. In the Summer of 2009 Willow Garage achieved the second of their milestones, enabling PR2 to autonomously open doors, locate power outlets, and plug itself in (a video of this is available on YouTube). In January 2010 Willow Garage achieved the third major milestone in the Personal Robotics Program releasing ROS at 1.0 and having PR2 ready for beta production. At the end of 2010 with PR2 for sale and the ROS community on its way to 100 repositories worldwide Keenan Wyrobek and Eric Berger left Willow Garage to pursue their next venture. Willow Garage currently had seven spin-offs: *hiDOF, Inc., a software consulting company. Acquired by Google in 2013. *Industrial Perception Inc. - Acquired by Google in August 2013, IPI had as its broader mission \\"eyes and brains for industrial robots\\", focused on new robotic applications in logistics such as autonomous truck unloading. *Open Perception Foundation ‚Äì Their mission is to advance the development and adoption of open source software for 2D/3D processing of sensory data, for the benefit of the industrial and research communities. *Open Source Robotics Foundation - OSRF is an independent non-profit formed to support the development, distribution, and adoption of open source software for use in robotics research, education, and product development. *Redwood Robotics - A joint venture between Meka Robotics, Willow Garage, and SRI. Acquired by Google in 2013. *Suitable Technologies - Creating Texai, a remote presence robotic product. *Unbounded Robotics - Low-cost mobile manipulation platform. In 2012, the company entered into a joint venture with Meka Robotics and SRI International to found Redwood Robotics, a company specializing in robotic arms. In August 2013, Suitable Technologies Inc. retained a majority of employees from Willow Garage to increase and enhance the development of Suitable Technologies‚Äô Beam‚Ñ¢ remote presence system. Willow Garage will continue to support customers of its PR2 personal robotics platform and sell its remaining stock of PR2 systems. In addition to spinoffs, former employees have created several other companies: *Zipline co-founded by Keenan Wyrobek (former Co-director with Eric Berger of ROS & PR2 at Willow Garage) delivers blood and other medical supplies by drone. *Savioke led by Steve Cousins (former CEO of Willow Garage) produces a service robot for the hotel industry.Savioke: https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/savioke-2#/entity *Fetch Robotics led by Melonee Wise (former Robot Development Manager at Willow Garage) produces autonomous mobile robots for logistics and manufacturing.Fetch Robotics: https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/fetch- robotics#/entity *Fyusion led by Radu Rusu (former Perception Researcher at Willow Garage) produces a 2.5D image capture/viewer.Fyusion: https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/fyusion#/entity Open source software Willow Garage was maintaining ROS (Robot Operating System), the OpenCV computer vision library, and PCL (Point Cloud Library). These projects all use the BSD license, an open source software license. ROS development is now overseen by Open Robotics. Robots The PR2 robot Willow Garage's first major robot is called PR2. It is of a size similar to a human. PR2 is designed as a common hardware and software platform for robot researchers. PR2 is a spinoff of PR1, a robotics platform being developed at Stanford University. PR stands for \\"personal robot\\". The PR2 has two 7-DOF arms with a payload of . Sensors include a 5-megapixel camera, a tilting laser range finder, and an inertial measurement unit. The \\"texture projector\\" projects a pattern on the environment to create 3D information for capture by the cameras. Willow Garage calls this \\"textured light\\", but this approach is better known as structured light. The head-mounted laser scanner measures distance by time-of-flight. The two computers located in the base of the robot are 8-core servers, each of which has 24 Gigabytes of RAM, for a total of 48 GB. The battery system consists of 16 laptop batteries. On May 26, 2010, Willow Garage held a graduation party in which the 11 PR2s were introduced. Some PR2s \\"danced\\" with humans while being led by their grippers. At least one party-goer attended by telepresence using the Willow Garage Texai remote presence device. Jonathan Knowles of Autodesk attended an XPrize cocktail party using a Texai to hobnob with Robin Williams. Project Texai resulted in the Willow Garage spin-off Suitable Technologies. Project Texai become the prototype for the product announced by Suitable in September 2012, the Beam. In June 2010, Willow Garage made two-year loans of a PR2 to 11 research teams. Each PR2 was to include two arms, a \\"rich sensor suite\\", a mobile base, 16 CPU cores, and the company's free, open-source Robot Operating System (ROS) framework, which controls the PR2 and comes with software libraries for perception, navigation, and manipulation. The teams were to have a chance not only to program a general- purpose robot but also to contribute their work on Willow Garage's open-source robotics platform to a wide community of researchers. In August 2010, Willow Garage announced that the PR2 robot was available for purchase. The PR2 is being programmed to do increasingly technical and dexterous applications including opening doors and folding towels. 3D models of the PR2 are available for many robotics simulation software. This allows users to visualize its 3D model, play with its joints and check its list of sensors.

Previously, she was a long-standing reporter for CNN. Career Awards and acclaim In 1991, she received the Maria Moors Cabot prize from Columbia University for contributing to \\"the advancement of press freedom and inter-American understanding\\". In March 1997, Newman became the first United States journalist in 27 years to have permanent residence in Cuba. However, after Newman's first news broadcast, Ninoska P√©rez Castell√≥n criticised her for not interviewing people who were against the Cuban government. P√©rez wanted Newman to show Cuba as a \\"normal place\\", not a \\"rogue nation\\". The North-South Institute praised her reporting and wrote that because she knows several languages, \\"she can find out things others cannot\\". Newman is fluent in English, Spanish, Portuguese and French. Both parents spoke German, Russian, Spanish, English and French. In addition, her father spoke Japanese and Portuguese; her mother spoke Italian and Swedish. CNN Newman worked for CNN for 20 years and reported from countries throughout Latin America. In 1987, she was in Panama, and on 16 September, the Panamanian government expelled her from the country after a mob saw her grinning during an interview with Manuel Noriega. Noriega called her a \\"disinformer\\". She was a correspondent in Nicaragua during 1985 to 1989 and in Chile from 1989 to 1993. From 1993 to 1997, she was the head of bureau in Mexico. Al Jazeera English In 2006, she left CNN for Al Jazeera English, in the run-up to its launch. She has been with the channel ever since. She is now the Latin America editor, based in Buenos Aires in Argentina, but also continues to appear regularly on-air. In 2013 alone, she has conducted studio-interviews, for the series Talk to Al Jazeera, with the President of Uruguay and the former President of Chile and has presented, for the series Al Jazeera Correspondent, an extended piece of reportage on the curious institution that is the Colonia Dignidad, as well as conventional news-reporting, as a correspondent in several countries, plus live studio-links. Personal life Early life Newman was born on 18 February 1952 in London,C Newman of US and Chilean parentage. When they met,C. Newman all foreign journalists and diplomats were housed at the Metropol Hotel in Moscow, to make it simpler for the Russian government to keep tabs on everyone. Her mother, Lucia Meza, was a junior cultural attach√© and her father, Joseph Newman, was bureau chief for the New York Herald Tribune. They were introduced by Walter Cronkite, who served as match-maker, for they never would have married if Cronkite had not interceded on her father's behalf, as her mother said. Both were life-long writers on foreign affairs.C.Newman Both parents eventually had to leave Moscow: her father, for criticising the regime and her mother when Chile severed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. As Bureau Chief for the New York Herald Tribune, the pair moved to Berlin for three years, and then to London for three years, where Lucia and her two sisters were born. The family then moved to New York, after spending three years in Buenos Aires. Joseph Newman worked at the United Nations, writing his own by-line on the editorial page of the NY Herald Tribune. The family moved to Bronxville, NY, when the Tribune collapsed after an extended strike, bringing to an end the longest-running newspaper in US history. Lucia went to elementary school at PS #8 in Bronxville, NY, watching her father, in her current events class, weekly interview prominent national and foreign leaders- on the first talking news show in New York: Faces and Places in the News. After the 7th grade, Lucia and her family moved to Washington, DC., where her father started the Book Division of US News & World Report. After high school, Lucia moved to Santiago, Chile, to enroll at the University of Chile. Education Newman said in an interview, \\"I didn't consider myself of a particular nationality;\\" in the United States, she felt like a \\"foreigner.\\" During her holidays, she spent much of her vacation in Chile with her large extended family. Upon graduating high school, she studied journalism at the University of Chile in Santiago. After General Augusto Pinochet‚Äôs coup d'√©tat on 11 September 1973, Newman discovered that her professors and colleagues started to vanish. Calling this \\"scary, no, terrifying,\\" Newman moved to Australia, where she landed a job at the Chilean Embassy in Australia, serving as a Spanish‚ÄìEnglish translator. The University of New South Wales accepted her \\"tuition-free\\" as a student. In April 1979, she received a bachelor's degree in communication from the University of New South Wales. Family Newman was married to the Panamanian official and documentary-maker, Demetrio Olaciregui. They have two daughters, Pia and Laura (Laurita). Newman now lives in Santiago Chile, while the family is based in Argentina.

Cloud to describe \\"a set of political and cultural discourses that have adopted psychotherapy's lexicon‚Äîthe conservative language of healing, coping, adaptation, and restoration of previously existing order‚Äîbut in contexts of social and political conflict\\". Cloud argued that the rhetoric of therapy encourages people to focus on themselves and their private lives rather than attempt to reform flawed systems of social and political power. This form of persuasion is primarily used by politicians, managers, journalists and entertainers as a way to cope with the crisis of the American Dream. Cloud said \\"the discursive pattern of translating social and political problems into the language of individual responsibility and healing is a rhetoric because of its powerful persuasive force\\", and it is rhetoric of \\"therapy\\" because \\"of its focus on the personal life of the individual as locus of both problem and responsibility for change\\".  Functions  The rhetoric of therapy has two functions, according to Cloud: (1) to exhort conformity with the prevailing social order and (2) to encourage identification with therapeutic values: individualism, familism, self-help, and self-absorption. It is directed towards individuals who cope with unemployment, family stress, sexual and domestic violence, child abuse, and other traumas that result from systemic hegemony such as women's oppression, racism, and capitalism.  History  The origins of therapeutic discourse, along with advertising and other consumerist cultural forms, emerged during the industrialization of the West during the 18th century. The new emphasis on the acquisition of wealth during this period produced discourse about the \\"democratic self-determination of individuals conceived as autonomous, self-expressive, self-reliant subjects\\" or, in short, the \\"self-made man\\". Cloud argued that the rhetoric of the self-made man was introduced to veil the growing polarity between classes of owners and laborers and that it disguised the fact that success attained through self- determination was never a real possibility for blacks, immigrants, the working class, and women. Therefore, the language of personal responsibility, adaptation, and healing served not to liberate the working class, the poor, and the socially marginalized, but to persuade members of these classes that they are individually responsible for their plight. The rhetoric of therapy served as a diversion away from attention to social ills. One prominent movement that developed from the rhetoric of therapy was the self-help movement, which encouraged its audiences to take personal responsibility for solving their problems without attention to race, class, and gender issues. The twofold objective of this particular movement‚Äîmental health and positive thinking‚Äîis demonstrated in one of the quintessential books of this period, The Power of Positive Thinking by Norman Vincent Peale. Cloud analyzed different case studies to show how the established order is maintained by redirecting blame from the hegemonic system to the individual. Cloud said that the rhetoric of family values blames the absence of the \\"traditional\\" family as the cause of social ills. The rhetoric of therapy is used to divert attention from issues caused by hegemonic systems by promoting the idea that restoration of the traditional family structure will result in a harmonious society. A second example of the rhetoric of therapy is illustrated in Cloud's discussion of the extensive media coverage of groups that supported the Gulf War. Cloud says that the media intentionally devoted significant attention to groups that supported the war in an effort to instill blame, guilt, shame, and anxiety in individuals who openly opposed the war.

The pond is formed by an earthen dam which backs up Carlton Brook. The area was acquired by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in 1966 to protect the waterfowl and other wildlife associated with this area in Central Maine. The original dam at Carlton Pond was a rock structure built in 1850 to provide water power for a sawmill operation. In 1972, the Fish and Wildlife Service reconstructed the dam to maintain the integrity of the structure and to assure continued maintenance of the open water, marsh, and wetland areas created by the original dam. A natural overflow near the structure provides an additional escape route for high water thereby affording extra protection for the dam and control structures. A right-of-way provides access to the dam for maintenance and public use. Carlton Pond is one of the few areas in the state which provides nesting habitat for black terns, which are on the endangered species list maintained by the State of Maine. State and federal non-game biologists and researchers have been monitoring black tern use of Carlton Pond WPA and other areas for several years in an attempt to better determine the species' population status. Carlton Pond WPA has historically provided good nesting habitat for waterfowl and other birds. To date, 33 bird species have been observed using refuge lands and waters. Many bird species that use Carlton Pond have been listed by the Partners-in-Flight organization as species that are declining. The Slender Blue Flag, a species listed as Threatened by the State of Maine, has been sighted at Carlton Pond.

He originally matriculated at Notre Dame, but suffered from a change in the offensive game plan when Bob Davie replaced Lou Holtz, who had recruited him. Early in his second season in 1998 he left the program and joined Northwestern after its fifth game in 1999. Despite playing only two and a half seasons for Northwestern, he is the current Northwestern record holder for many quarterback rushing and passing statistics, including single season and career rushing touchdowns, career rushing yardage, career and single-season consecutive games with a touchdown pass and career consecutive pass attempts without an interception. He was a 2001 Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award finalist. Early life As a sophomore, Kustok led Lincoln-Way Central High School to a SICA West championship. By the time he was a sophomore during the 1994‚Äì95 school year, he was as well known as one of the best football prospects in the Chicago metropolitan area as he was as a scholar who ranked first in his class of 925 students. He also started at point guard on the basketball team. Kustok was unhappy at Lincoln-Way, so his family moved from Frankfort, Illinois to Orland Park, Illinois. Thus, as a junior, he transferred to Sandburg High School, and he led them to an 11‚Äì0 start to their season and a second round of the 1995 Class 6A playoffs win against Schaumburg High School before losing to Romeoville High School in the quarterfinals. Entering his senior season in 1996, he was the top-rated quarterback in the Chicago area and one of 9 local players ranked among the nation's top 100. Although he was a standout in football, he earned a Chicago Tribune prep athlete of the week award for his basketball performance both as a junior and as a senior. In the spring, before his senior season, he announced that he intended to attend Notre Dame. Kustok chose Notre Dame over Northwestern. Kustok earned the 1997 Tribune Scholar Athlete of the Year award from the Chicago Tribune. Entering his senior season, USA Today rated him as one of the top 25 prospects in Illinois. That season, he again led Sandburg to the Class 6A football playoffs, but the team only went 6‚Äì4 as he endured injuries and an inexperienced offensive line. That season, he was an All-Area special mention athlete in both football and basketball. Although head coach Lou Holtz left Notre Dame following the 1996 season, Kustok remained committed to his replacement Bob Davie even though Ron Powlus decided not to enter the 1997 NFL Draft. After his senior season, he was ranked as the second best quarterback (behind Antwaan Randle El) and seventh best football prospect in the Chicago area. In his 1997 senior spring, he won the regional competition for the Footaction High School Quarterback Challenge, which qualified him to compete at the Wide World of Sports Complex at Walt Disney World against 14 other high school quarterbacks. College career Kustok spent the 1997 season as a quarterback for the scout team at Notre Dame. During 1998 Spring football, freshman Kustok found himself in a battle with junior Jarious Jackson, sophomore Eric Chappell, and incoming freshman Arnaz Battle for the starting role in a newly revamped option offense for the 1998 NCAA Division I-A football season. Kustok, like Powlus before him, was more of a drop back passer and suddenly found himself fourth on the depth chart at the beginning of the 1998 Notre Dame season. In late September, he decided to leave the program. While at the University of Notre Dame he was a Dean's List scholar with a 3.519 grade point average on a 4.0 scale. He transferred to Moraine Valley Junior College near his family in Orland Park. In December 1998, he committed to Kansas. However, Kansas received a commitment from Dylen Smith, and Kustok received offers from outgoing Northwestern coach Gary Barnett, who was transitioning to a new job as Colorado Buffaloes football head coach as well as an offer from Northwestern. In February 1999, Kustok committed to Northwestern. The following summer, incumbent quarterback Gavin Hoffman announced he was transferring to Penn. Upon transferring the date of his athletic eligibility was contested because although by all accounts Kustok left Notre Dame on September 28, his transcripts were not registered an official date of October 21. This necessitated a request for court ordered emergency relief in the Cook County Circuit Court. He sought immediate eligibility which was denied. In mid-September the NCAA settled with Kustok and granted him eligibility for the October 2 game based on the September 28 date. Kustok made his debut after Northwestern fell behind Minnesota 14‚Äì0 in the game and head coach Randy Walker removed starter Nick Kreinbrink. The following week, he started against Indiana. He was a 2001 finalist for the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award along with Joey Harrington, David Carr, Eric Crouch and Kurt Kittner. During that season as team co-captain and team MVP, he compiled a school-record and Big Ten-leading 3,272 yards of total offense, which ranked tenth in the nation. He was co-MVP of the 2000 Alamo Bowl along with Dan Alexander and Kyle Vanden Bosch of Nebraska. Kustok graduated with the following Northwestern football records, many of which have been broken: *single-season: total offense (3,272 in 2001; since broken by Mike Kafka in 2009), touchdown passes (20 in 2001, since broken by Brett Basanez in 2005), rush-pass plays (579 in 2001; since broken by Kafka), rushing touchdowns by a quarterback (11) and touchdowns responsible for (31 in 2001), *career: consecutive games with a TD pass (24), consecutive passes without an interception (277), most 200-yard passing games (14, since broken by Brett Basanez in 2005), touchdowns responsible for (64), rushing yardage by a quarterback (1,294) and rushing touchdowns by a quarterback (22) Professional career Kustok was signed by the Miami Dolphins as an undrafted free agent on April 26, 2002 following the 2002 NFL Draft. He was waived on August 26 during initial roster cuts. After spending the 2002 season out of football, Kustok signed with the Green Bay Packers on February 7, 2003. He was allocated to NFL Europe on February 14 to play for the Berlin Thunder, and returned to the Packers on March 25. He was waived on June 17. Kustok was signed by the Chicago Bears to a two-year contract on March 26, 2004. He was released on May 2. Personal Kustok is the son of Allan and Anita Kustok. Allan was a member of Mendel Catholic High School's 1968 team, which won the 1968 Prep Bowl championship. He also played catcher on the baseball team. Allan played football for Illinois. Allan had a tryout with the Chicago Bears. Zak's younger sister Sarah became Chicago Sun-Times' 2000 Girls High School Basketball Player of the Year and captain of the DePaul Blue Demons women's basketball team before becoming a reporter for Comcast SportsNet. His wife Nicole (formerly Kuznia) was named Minnesota's 1999 Junior Miss and was also an All-American cross country runner at Northwestern. In 2014, Zak graduated the University of Notre Dame with an M.B.A. On September 29, 2010, Kustok's mother was shot and killed, with his father accused as the murderer. She worked at Central Elementary School in Riverside, Illinois. Allan was convicted and sentenced to 60 years in prison.

The courthouse is included in the Wilmington Commercial Historic District which was added to the National Register on 1982-10-14. History Clinton County was established in 1810 with the county seat at Wilmington. The courts met in various locations around town until the courthouse was finished in 1813. The courthouse was undertaken in two phases. The first phase was the masonry, with the contract awarded to Jacob Hale and the second was the wood work awarded to Mr. Sayres from Lebanon. The structure consisted of red brick supported by a stone foundation. A pitched roof rested on a red brick cornice with two chimneys to either side and a central cupola. By 1837 the county was faced with an expanding population and the need for a larger courthouse. Plans were sought by the county with the plans by John B. Posey, a County Commissioner, being selected. Bids began to be accepted for the construction with the masonry work awarded to John Bush, and the plastering contract going to Thomas & Alfred Shockley and William & Joshua Noble. The old courthouse was sold to aid in the construction costs The new courthouse was completed in 1838 and was built in the Greek Revival style. The rectangular structure had a central entrance framed by four Doric columns supporting an unadorned pediment. This building would last until 1915 when Clinton County passed a resolution declaring a new courthouse was needed. During a competition, the design was awarded to plans submitted by the architectural firm of Weber, Werner & Adkins with a budget of $300,000 allotted to the project. The courthouse was dedicated in 1919 to much ceremony. Exterior The courthouse somewhat resembles the old U.S. Capitol before the Civil War additions. The rusticated foundation is hidden behind a balustrade that wraps around the entire structure. The ground floor consists of smooth stone and arched windows, each with a decorative keystone. The entrances are accessed by a small recessed portico with three large arches. Above the entrances are four colossal Corinthian columns inside a recessed panel. Rectangular windows spread out on either side of this panel, lighting the various rooms within. An entablature supports the flat roof and a balustrade lines the roof. Instead of a typical dome, the building is crowned by a large dome containing a skylight illuminating the stained-glass window inside.

The project was sponsored by Openmoko and made by Pandigital, and its source code has been released. The project debuted an offline portable reader for Wikipedia in October 2009. Updates in multiple languages were available online and a twice-yearly offline update service delivered via Micro SD card was also available at a cost of $29 per year. Wikireader versions of the English Wikipedia, Wiktionary, Wikiquote and Project Gutenberg can be installed together on a user-supplied 16 GB Micro SDHC Memory Card. Unlike Wikipedia itself, the device features parental controls. The device can also run programs written in Forth; a simple calculator program is included. In late 2014, the WikiReader website and project itself were shut down and abandoned for unknown reasons. Existing WikiReaders no longer receive updates to their database. Devices and homegrown updates are only available from the secondary markets.  Specifications  WikiReader being used.

The device therefore does not store or display any Wikipedia images. * Tables: The WikiReader does not display article text which appears inside a table on the Wikipedia Website (see Wikipedia:Tables). * HTML \\"special characters\\": Certain Wikipedia article text encoded using HTML special characters is stripped from the WikiReader's output. * Mathematical formulas: Original versions of the WikiReader do not display Wikipedia article information encoded as a formula using LaTeX (see Math markup). This has been addressed with an optional firmware update, which is pre-loaded on newer WikiReaders. * Treatment of missing information: The WikiReader does not provide any indication of gaps where information has been deleted from a Wikipedia article. Images, tables, mathematical formulas and other information that was not encoded strictly as plain text in the original Wikipedia article is silently deleted from the WikiReader's output. * Search: The WikiReader's search capabilities are basic. There is no full text search capability. Only the titles of Wikipedia articles can be searched. The WikiReader does support incremental search of article titles, beginning with the first characters of each title. Search terms must be spelled correctly. Wildcard searching is not supported. Updated Wikireader Images The last official wikireader image was released by Pandigital in 2011. However, there an exists an active fork of the original software capable of producing new images.

His last home was an apartment in Greenwich Village, half a block north of the Jefferson Market Courthouse (now the Jefferson Market Library). The building was renumbered in 1929, when Manhattan's Sixth Avenue was extended south, and is now 453 6th Avenue. The NYC LGBT Historic Sites Project lists the building.

This is done primarily through designing and implementing programmes which improve the quality and reach of cultural education, and use culture and the arts to improve the quality and impact of general education, working with partners from around the world. CCE is a winner of a 2011 WISE Award from the World Innovation Summit for Education (WISE) foundation. The award recognised CCE's Creative Partnerships programme, which worked with over one million pupils across England, developing the skills of children and young people, raising their aspirations and opening up new opportunities. Before creating CCE, Chief Executive Paul Collard had had over 30 years' experience of working in the arts. He is an expert in delivering programmes that use creativity and culture as drivers of social and economic change and in using arts and culture in urban regeneration. In 2015, he was appointed Honorary Professor at the University of Nottingham, School of Education.

In 2016, CCE is supporting Creative Scotland‚Äôs review of the role of creative learning in its strategic plan and Education Scotland in ensuring that the Scottish Government‚Äôs Attainment Challenge goals in respect to creativity and creative learning are met. * Find Your Talent ‚Äì Find Your Talent was a 2008‚Äì2010 government-funded programme trialled in ten areas of England which gave children and young people the chance to try out different high-quality cultural and creative activities in and out of school. * International Creative Education Network (ICEnet) ‚Äì CCE is one of the core founding members of this European network of practitioners working in creative education. One example of the partnership‚Äôs projects was developing a Self- Assessment Competency Framework for Creative Practitioners working in educational settings to develop the creativity of children (2015), along with case studies and policy recommendations, informed by the expertise of the thirteen partners as well as artists and other creative professionals from around Europe. * Kulturschule, Germany ‚Äì CCE has collaborated on this cultural education programme with Gabriele Fink Stiftung since 2011. CCE‚Äôs involvement has included training for schools and artists, providing diagnostic tools for schools or supporting the research and evaluation programme. The programme has aimed to put culture at the heart of school development and education to help children and young people learn deeply. * Open for Business ‚Äì CCE designed and delivered the education programme for a 2013‚Äì2015 photography project Open for Business organised by Multistory in partnership with Magnum Photos, the Financial Times and other organisations and supported by Arts Council England and Sandwell Council. The work included training for teachers, educators and local photographers as well as developing a curriculum framework for schools to encourage better use of photography. * Perth, Western Australia ‚Äì In 2011, Paul Collard was appointed the Commissioner for Children and Young People's inaugural Thinker in Residence under the theme of Unlocking Creativity. As part of the role, he researched how well the arts, culture and education were developing children‚Äôs creativity, preparing them for work in international settings and showing the opportunities within creative industries, with the outcomes and recommendations presented in a report. The successful residency led to further work with the Western Australia Museum on how to embed creativity and creative learning in the new museum‚Äôs design and work and arrangements for a 2016 residency supported by the Department of Culture and Arts of Western Australia. * South Korean Teacher Exchange Programme ‚Äì CCE was the UK coordinator of the 2013 and 2014 Teaching Abroad for Global Competency Programme organised by the UNESCO Asia-Pacific Centre of Education for International Understanding (APCEIU) and sponsored by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea. Over the two years, CCE hosted 25 South Korean teachers and, on top of preparing a programme of activities, recruiting host schools in the North East England and supporting the teachers throughout their stay, it provided an intensive training and reflection programme to complement school placements.

The Beaufort Gyre is one of the two major ocean currents in the Arctic Ocean, it is roughly located north of the Alaskan and Canadian coast. In the past, Arctic sea-ice would circulate in the Beaufort gyre up to several years, leading to the formation of very thick multi-year sea-ice. Due to warming temperatures in the Arctic, the gyre has lost an extensive amount of ice, practically turning what used to be a nursery for sea-ice to mature and grow into the thickest and oldest ice of the Arctic Ocean into a \\"graveyard\\" for older ice. Dynamical mechanisms Conditions in the Arctic have favored sea ice loss in recent years during the Northern Hemisphere summers. At the end of the 20th century, analyses of increasing Pacific Surface Water temperatures led to the discovery of a connection between these rising temperatures and the onset of severe loss of Arctic sea ice in the Beaufort Sea. A reason for the existence of this link was proposed: \\"...delayed winter ice formation allows for more efficient coupling between the ocean and wind forcing.\\" These dynamical mechanisms are observed in the spin-up and circulation of the Beaufort Gyre. Arctic Sea Ice Age: 1984 - 2019 Housed in the western part of the Arctic Ocean is the Beaufort Gyre, whose growing reservoir of freshwater is shrouded in mystery. In recent years, this increasing freshwater content (FWC) has been the focal point of many studies, particularly those concerning coupled ocean-atmosphere dynamics. The majority of the Arctic‚Äôs freshwater content resides in the Beaufort Gyre. Although biased toward the Northern Hemisphere summer months, observations from submarines, ships, and stations on drifting ice suggest that the gyre has been expanding over the past two decades. Researchers have employed coupled sea-ice-ocean general circulation models in order to thoroughly analyze these observations. Model results show that Ekman transport plays an integral role in the variability of freshwater in the gyre, and thus in the Arctic Ocean. The prevailing rotational direction of the Beaufort Gyre is clockwise, following the prevailing wind circulation of the Polar High. Coriolis veers moving objects to the right in the northern hemisphere and \\"to the right\\" is inwards in a clockwise rotating system. This is why anything floating, including fresher water tends to move toward the centre of the system. Indeed, there is a slight bulge in the centre of the Beaufort gyre when it is rotating in its predominant clockwise direction. If, as is speculated, as the Arctic Ocean becomes a heat collector resulting in a low pressure, counter clockwise rotating system, the Beaufort Gyre can be expected to follow suit and send the fresher water outward to be captured by the transpolar current. This could well bring up the saltier, slightly warmer Atlantic water which lies under the floating, fresher Arctic water. Variations in the Ekman transport change the sea surface height and depth of the halocline, resulting in Ekman pumping. During anticyclonic regimes‚Äîwhere the wind stress curl is negative‚Äîfreshwater is pumped into the Beaufort Gyre; during cyclonic regimes‚Äîwhere wind stress curl is positive‚Äîfreshwater is released into the Arctic Ocean, where it can then flow into the North Atlantic. Giles et al. (2012) conclude that the variability in freshwater content varies with wind stress curl. The wind stress curl used by Giles et al. (2012) is from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data at the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration, Earth System Research Laboratory, Physical Sciences Division (NOAA/OAR/ESRL PSD) in Boulder, Colorado, USA. The seasonal cycle of freshwater content does not only concern mechanical (Ekman pumping) processes, but thermal (ice formation) processes as well. The Beaufort Gyre contains a mean volume of of frozen freshwater, or sea ice, based on a mean ice thickness of 2 meters. During the June‚ÄìJuly months, the mean seasonal cycle of freshwater content peaks; in this season, sea ice thickness reaches a minimum, implying that the amount of melted sea ice has reached a maximum. The maximum in freshwater content released into the ocean waters coincides with a maximum in wind stress curl (i.e., a minimum in Ekman pumping), allowing for a high volume of freshwater to seep into the Arctic Ocean circulation. This rapid influx of freshwater into the Arctic circulation forces a large volume of freshwater to outflow into the North Atlantic basin, affecting the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Studies The Beaufort Gyre has formed a dome of freshwater that has expanded vertically by about since 2002; by 2011 it had swelled to about in volume. The freshwater within this gyre represents about 10% of all the freshwater in the Arctic Ocean; the majority of the Arctic's freshwater supply originates from Russian rivers as runoff. The clockwise circulation of the Beaufort Gyre is induced by the wind patterns associated with the permanent anticyclonic high pressure system over the western part of the Arctic. In a clockwise-rotating gyre in the Northern Hemisphere, the Coriolis force causes the ocean water to flow inward toward the gyre's center where it accumulates, effectively forming a dome of water. If the wind patterns shift into a cyclonic circulation due to the residence of a low pressure system (rising air induced by warmer ocean temperatures a greater volume of open Arctic Ocean water), this will cause the circulation of the Beaufort Gyre to reverse and flow counter-clockwise. If this occurs, the Coriolis force would bend the flow out and away from the center of the gyre and, instead of the formation of a rising water dome, a depression would form and upwelling of the warmer water from the Atlantic ocean would occur. Oceanographer Andrey Proshutinsky has theorized that if the winds and the gyre's circulation were to weaken, high volumes of freshwater could leak out of the eastern part of the Arctic Ocean into the Northern Atlantic Ocean, impacting the Thermohaline Circulation and thus climate. Due to seasonal sea ice formation, the Beaufort Gyre is difficult to access and thus study in the Northern Hemisphere winter months; the lack of sunlight in these months forces the use of artificial light.. Expanded Academic ASAP. Web. 13 Oct. 2009. Studies by Arthur S. Dyke and others show that if the volume of outflow of rivers into the Beaufort Gyre increase, the gyre itself might spatially shift toward the right.. Expanded Academic ASAP. Web. 13 Oct. 2009.

He was the dean of College of Liberal Arts of Zhengzhou University. He was a delegate to the 12th National People's Congress and the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. He was a member of the China Writers Association. Biography Ling was born in Xiyang County, Shanxi. His father Ling Erwen () was the director of CPC Xiyang Committee. His mother Ma Cuilan () was the chairwoman of CPC Xiyang Women's Federation. He moved to Nanyang, Henan, and settled there with his parents. He graduated from Nanyang No. 3 High School. He served in the People's Liberation Army for ten years from 1968 to 1978. In 1978 he became an official in the Propaganda Department of the CPC Nanyang Municipal Committee. His inspiration for the emperor biographies came from his study of Dream of the Red Chamber, one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature. He is also a member of the standing committee of the Chinese Redology Association, with a group of people devoting time and effort on the study of the aforementioned novel. Ling began writing his first novel, The Great Kangxi Emperor, in 1984 and later published Yongzheng Emperor and Qianlong Emperor as part of the same historical fiction series. The hugely popular books follow three generations of leaders during the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) and feature tales of corruption, invasions and rivalries between royal siblings.

Android version of the game was developed by HeroCraft. The series utilizes a point-and-click arcade gameplay model that enables the player to manage the production processes on a farm using a mouse. Gameplay The goal in a Farm Frenzy game is to purchase animals, process the goods they produce and sell the products for cash. The player feeds animals by watering grass for them to eat, and collects products that they regularly drop and are stored in a warehouse with limited capacity. Predators such as bears sometimes appear on the farm that must be caged by repeatedly clicking on them; otherwise, the predators will toss the other animals off the farm and destroy any goods lying on the ground. Each level has a unique set of objectives, which might include owning so many of a particular animal, producing a certain number of goods or having a specific amount of cash on hand. The player must complete the goals for a level within a specific time limit and are rewarded with silver and gold medals for completing the objectives quickly. Depending on the medal earned for a level, the player earns stars which they use to purchase upgrades that allow them to progress through the game. There are currently 14 games in the series, each having similar gameplay, but in unique environments and new levels. Farm Frenzy 3 is notable for containing a number of additional features, including a central character named Scarlett, a storyline involving Scarlett's quest to help farmers around the world, reworked gameplay that gives the player more control over the operation of her farm, the inclusion of five farms around the world and additional farm animals unique to each region. The visual style of the Farm Frenzy games is lighthearted, with the artists employing bright colors and humorous animation to portray the action. Today, Alawar has translated the Farm Frenzy series into more than a dozen languages and ported it to multiple platforms, including the Mac, iPhone, the Android, Nintendo DS and Windows Phone. The PC version of Farm Frenzy received the Best Casual Game award at the 2008 Russian Game Developers Conference. History Farm Frenzy started to take shape when Alex Meleshkevich, CEO of Belarus-based casual game developer Melesta, met Kirill Plotnikov, vice president of publishing for Alawar Entertainment, at Casual Connect 2007 and they decided to create a game in the time management genre, with the business simulator Chicken Chase as their source of inspiration. * Alawar published Farm Frenzy in November 2007, topping the charts of RealNetworks, MSN Games, Big Fish Games, Pogo.com, iWin and other portals. * Alawar began working on a sequel to Farm Frenzy soon after the release of the original game, with a team of 16 developers spending six months on the title. This game was Farm Frenzy 2, which was published in July 2008. * Alawar published Farm Frenzy: Pizza Party! in January 2009, during the economic crisis. * Alawar published Farm Frenzy 3 in July 2009.

While Gone Fishing and Ancient Rome retained a style similar to Farm Frenzy 3 and featured Scarlett, Viking Heroes made many minor changes and created a new story and characters set in the viking age. * Alawar published Farm Frenzy 4 on April 29, 2014. Farm Frenzy 4 is the first in the series to feature HD graphics and 3D models for characters, objects and animations. While gameplay is similar to previous titles, the visuals are significantly different. * Alawar published Farm Frenzy: Hurricane Season on September 22, 2015 and Farm Frenzy: Heave Ho on May 23, 2016, both of which feature a new art style and the return of Scarlett.

Description Grevillea acerata is a spreading shrub which grows to a height of and has more or less linear leaves which are long and wide. The edges of the leaves are rolled under and partly or completely cover the lower surface which is covered with silky to woolly hairs. The flowers are arranged in more or less spherical groups in diameter on the ends of branches.

The substance is described as \\"jello-like sheets of disease-carrying mucus\\" that holds a strong presence in the Mediterranean Sea and has been spreading into farther-flung waters.  Causes  Sea snot forms when globs of marine snow coagulate into large globs that can span distances as large as 124 miles. The mucilage has many components, including a wide range of microorganisms including viruses and prokaryotes, and exopolymeric compounds with colloidal properties. Sea snot is also produced by phytoplankton when they are stressed.  Effects  An increase in the amount of sea snot in the Mediterranean and other seas observed at least as early as 2009 may have been the result of climate change. Warmer, slower moving waters increase the production of sea snot and allow it to accumulate in massive blobs. Sea snot was first reported in 1729 and has long been seen as a nuisance to the fishing industry and coastal populations. Recently, sea snot has emerged not only as a nuisance, but as a major hazard. Globs of sea snot can harbor bacteria such as E. coli that threaten maritime flora and fauna as well as humans exposed to contaminated water. It can also coat the gills of sea creatures subsumed in it, cutting off oxygen and killing them. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico created large amounts of sea snot. Scientists are not sure how exactly the spill caused so much sea snot to form, but one theory asserts that the sea snot could have been the result of a massive kill of microscopic marine life creating a \\"blizzard\\" of marine snow. Scientists worry that the mass of sea snot could pose a biohazard to surviving marine life in the area. It is widely believed that the Sea Snot left by the spill directly resulted in the loss of sealife in the Gulf of Mexico based upon a dead field of deepwater coral 11 kilometers away from the Deepwater Horizon station.http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110413/full/472152a.html  See also    References  Category:Aquatic ecology Category:Biological oceanography ","title":"Sea snot"},{"id":"24673370","text":"Embelia ribes, commonly known as false black pepper, white-flowered embelia, vidanga, vaividang, vai vidang, or vavding, is a species in the family Primulaceae.

Hui Aloha  ªƒÄina for Women. Opposition to the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom took several forms. Following the overthrow of the monarchy on January 17, 1893, Hawaii's provisional government‚Äîunder the leadership of Sanford B. Dole‚Äîattempted to annex the land to the United States under Republican Benjamin Harrison's administration. But the treaty of annexation came up for approval under the administration of Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, anti-expansionist, and friend of the deposed Queen Liliuokalani of Hawaii. Cleveland retracted the treaty on March 4, 1893, and launched an investigation headed by James Henderson Blount; its report is known as the Blount Report. Background The overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom was a result of progressive governmental control by foreigners and their descendants who were coming in increasing numbers to the islands of Hawaii. Many of these foreigners bought Hawaiian land and invested in the lucrative Hawaiian sugar industry. In 1887, these men forced the then reigning king, KalƒÅkaua, to sign the so-called Bayonet Constitution, which stripped him of much of his power, in turn creating a constitutional monarchy. In 1890, the United States enacted the McKinley Tariff; the new law sharply raised the country's import tariffs, ending the Hawaiian sugar industry's dominance in the North American market and depressing prices, pushing Hawaii into turmoil. Following the sugar crash, in 1893 the reigning Queen Lili'uokalani proposed a new constitution to replace the 1887 one. If adopted, the new constitution would revoke many of the foreigners' powers, and put the queen back in control of the Kingdom. The proposal was backed by the majority of the native population; however, it was naturally opposed by the Americans and other foreigners. Hoping for American intervention, they began planning a coup. Anti-monarchists coalesced, forming the Committee of Safety while royalist leaders formed the Committee of Law and Order in support of the queen and the government.; The situation soon escalated as both sides armed themselves. Fearing for American safety, the United States called on to land a small force of Marines to protect American interests. Although the Americans were sworn to neutrality and never fired a shot, they did intimidate the royalist defenders, and Queen Lili'uokalani, fearing bloodshed, conceded.: She...defended her act[ions] by showing that, out of a possible 9,500 native voters in 1892, 6,500 asked for a new Constitution. Blount Report In an attempt to undo the work of the Harrison administration, Cleveland removed John L. Stevens as Minister to Hawaii, as well as Gilbert C. Wiltse as captain of USS Boston. He then retracted the treaty of annexation from the U.S. Senate, citing the opposition of Hawaiian citizens to annexation. The provisional government then became the Republic of Hawaii. After withdrawing the annexation treaty, Cleveland sent an emissary (Blount) to investigate the circumstances surrounding the revolution and the situation in Hawaii. The report stated that the provisional government was not established with the consent or approval of the Hawaiian people. It also claimed that Liliuokalani only surrendered after being convinced that the provisional government was supported by the United States and fearing a bloody military conflict. According to Blount, she was told by the revolutionaries that the U.S. president would consider her case after surrendering. After reviewing the report, Cleveland decided not to send back the treaty he had withdrawn. Blount's findings were disputed by the provisional government. Black Week On December 14, 1893, Albert Willis arrived in Honolulu aboard USRC Corwin unannounced, bringing an anticipation of an American invasion to restore the monarchy, which became known as the Black Week. Willis was the successor to James Blount as United States Minister to Hawaii. With the hysteria of a military assault, he staged a mock invasion with and , directing their guns toward the capital. He also ordered Rear Admiral John Irwin to organize a landing operation using troops on the two American ships, which was joined by the Japanese and the British .Report Committee Foreign Relations, United States Senate, Accompanying Testimony, Executive Documents transmitted Congress January 1, 1893, March 10, 1891, p 2144History of later years of the Hawaiian Monarchy and the revolution of 1893 By William De Witt Alexander, p 103 After the arrival of Corwin, the provisional government and citizens of Hawaii were ready to rush to arms if necessary, but it was widely believed that Willis' threat of force was a bluff. On December 16, 1893, the British Minister to Hawaii was given permission to land marines from HMS Champion for the protection of British interests; the ship's captain predicted that Liliuokalani would be restored by the U.S. military. In a November 1893 meeting with Willis, Liliuokalani indicated that she wanted the revolutionaries punished and their property confiscated, despite Willis' desire for her to grant amnesty to her enemies. On December 19, 1893, while meeting with the leaders of the provisional government, Willis presented a letter written by Liliuokalani, in which she agreed to grant amnesty to the revolutionaries if she was restored as queen. During the conference, Willis told the provisional government to surrender to Liliuokalani and allow Hawaii to return to its previous condition, but Dole refused to comply with his demands, claiming that he was not subject to the authority of the United States. A few weeks later, on January 10, 1894, U.S. Secretary of State Walter Q. Gresham announced that the settlement of the situation in Hawaii would be left up to Congress, citing Willis' unsatisfactory progress. Cleveland said that Willis had carried out the letter of his directions, rather than their spirit. On January 11, 1894, Willis confirmed that the invasion had been a hoax. Domestic responses Domestic response to Willis' and Cleveland's efforts was largely negative. The independent New York Herald wrote: \\"If Minister Willis has not already been ordered to quit meddling in Hawaiian affairs and mind his own business, no time should be lost in giving him emphatic instructions to that effect.\\" The Democratic New York World wrote: \\"Is it not high time to stop the business of interference with the domestic affairs of foreign nations? Hawaii is 2000 miles from our nearest coast. Let it alone.\\" The Democratic New York Sun said: \\"Mr. Cleveland lacks ... the first essential qualification of a referee or arbitrator.\\" The Republican New York Tribune called Willis' trip a \\"forlorn and humiliating failure to carry out Mr. Cleveland's outrageous project\\". The Republican New York Recorder wrote: \\"The idea of sending out a minister accredited to the President of a new republic, having him present his credentials to that President and address him as 'Great and Good Friend', and then deliberately set to work to organize a conspiracy to overthrow his Government and re-establish the authority of the deposed Queen, is repugnant to every man who holds American honor and justice in any sort of respect.\\" The Democratic New York Times was one of the few New York City newspapers that defended Cleveland's decisions: \\"Mr. Willis discharged his duty as he understood it.\\" Response from the Queen Liliuokalani Liliuokalani's statement yielding authority, on January 17, 1893, protested the overthrow: > I Liliuokalani, by the Grace of God and under the Constitution of the > Hawaiian Kingdom, Queen, do hereby solemnly protest against any and all acts > done against myself and the Constitutional Government of the Hawaiian > Kingdom by certain persons claiming to have established a Provisional > Government of and for this Kingdom.

Dole received her letter, but neither read it nor challenged her claim of surrendering to the \\"superior force of the United States of America.\\" He then sent representatives to Washington, D.C. to negotiate a treaty of annexation.

They rallied behind two groups: Hui Aloha  ªƒÄina (Hawaiian Patriotic League) and Hui KƒÅlai ªƒÅina (Hawaiian Political Association). On January 5, 1895, native islanders staged an armed revolution, but the attempt was quelled by Republic of Hawaii supporters. Those leading the attempt were jailed, along with Liliuokalani, who was accused of not stopping the revolt. After William McKinley, who favored annexation, became President of the United States in 1897, a new treaty of annexation was signed and sent to United States Senate for approval. In response, the Hawaiian Patriotic League and its female counterpart petitioned Congress, opposing the annexation treaty. In September and October of that year, Hui Aloha  ªƒÄina collected 556 pages for a total of 21,269 signatures of native Hawaiians ‚Äî or over half of native residents ‚Äî opposing annexation. Hui KƒÅlai ªƒÅina collected around 17,000 signatures for restoring the monarchy, but their version has been lost to history. Four Hawaiian delegates: James Keauiluna Kaulia, David Kalauokalani, William Auld, and John Richardson traveled to Washington, DC to present the K≈´ ªƒì Petitions to Congress which convened in December. After presenting the petition to the U.S. Senate and then lobbying senators, they were able to force the treaty's failure in 1898. However, in 1898, the Senate passed the Newlands Resolution due to the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War; the resolution resulted in Hawaii's annexation for use as a Pacific military base.Schamel, Wynell and Charles E.

Jasik left company early on, to develop the MacNosy product for the Macintosh. Sorcim was best known for SuperCalc, a spreadsheet the company developed for the Osborne Computer Corporation portable computer. The company made many other products, including SuperWriter and SuperProject before its acquisition by Computer Associates in 1985. Although the company continued as a largely autonomous division of CA, it never again achieved prominence after the acquisition. The company was named \\"Sorcim\\" after Richard Frank saw a reflection of the word ‚Äúmicros‚Äù in an airplane window. Early history The company was founded to expand the microcomputer products from Digicom, a company formed by Richard in 1978. Paul joined in 1979. The Digicom software programs ran on the CP/M operating system using the Intel 8080, 8085 and later the 8086, Zilog Z80 and the Z8000. The company's early products included Pascal/M, and ACT - a set of cross assemblers including one for the Atari (8080) and the Commodore Pet (6502). In these early days of the company, and before the introduction of the IBM PC and MS-DOS, Sorcim used Godbout S100 bus CP/M machines for development; these machines were fast and the people at Godbout were competent hardware developers. Bill Godbout was one of the first commercial accounts for Sorcim, supporting the company's cross assemblers and Pascal/M. In fact at one time Godbout helped relieve a short-term cash flow problem by doing a one-time buy of development tool products. \\"Bill was one of those people who always provided you an honest opinion (sometimes to the dismay of Sorcim managers) and great Friday lunch meetings.\\" The birth of SuperCalc In 1980 at one of the local monthly computer industry poker parties, Bill Godbout introduced Richard Frank to Adam Osborne. Lee Felsenstein was developing the industry's first portable computer for Adam's new company, and he needed a CP/M BIOS.A computer in every hand, July 17, 1999, By David Pescovitz, Salon People Rewind Archived version This computer was released as the Osborne I. In late Fall of 1980, Adam was looking for a spreadsheet for the Osborne I. His efforts to acquire rights to VisiCalc were disappointing, so he asked Sorcim if they would be interested in developing a spreadsheet that would be competitive with VisiCalc, and develop it in time to showcase it at the West Coast Computer Faire in April 1981. The company accepted the challenge, working days on contract programming (a CHILL compiler for Siemens) and nights on the Osborne BIOS and SuperCalc. With Martin Herbach as the lead architect, the company hired Gary Balleisen, as the lead developer, to implement a demo version of the application. Someone selected the name SuperCalc. The product was introduced in April 1981 at the West Coast Computer Faire in the Osborne booth. The enthusiastic reception surprised the Sorcim folks. SuperCalc was written in assembly code using Sorcim's ACT assembler. Eventually SuperCalc was ported to over 150 different hardware platforms - from the Osborne I to the Zenith Z89. By the 18-month mark, the company had sold over 250,000 copies of the original SuperCalc. During this period, the company estimated that VisiCalc's market share was about 85% and SuperCalc was about 15%. There were some other early spreadsheet programs, but these two programs shared essentially the entire market. Growing pains Toward the end of 1982, the founders had become dissatisfied with company management. They removed the company president and each founder took on an acting VP role: Martin Herbach ran Sales, Anil Lakahara was responsible for software development, Paul McQuesten supervised Finance, and Richard - despite having a business card that read \\"Programmer\\" - was CEO, and Chairman. But the founders were unhappy in these roles (for most of them, not their core competencies), and they were actively looking for a new president to guide the company's growth. SuperCalc2, SuperWriter, and SuperChart, which were all announced in November 1982, had no concrete ship dates, and a census of projects in the company showed that the development staff of about 20 people was working on over 100 projects. This was whittled down to the main applications and development tools. At this time, the company made its first serious effort to establish control over the products, and Greg Resnick (who came aboard with the SpellGuard acquisition) became Product Manager of SuperWriter, while new hire Walter Feigenson came in to manage SuperCalc. The founders were still actively looking for a new leader during the early part of 1983, since they were out of their elements and getting more frustrated as time moved on. They had interviewed a number of candidates for CEO, but none was acceptable. Finally they coalesced around Jim Pelkey, who had started consulting for the founders in late 1982. Pelkey was introduced to the company by Jack Melchor of Melchor Venture Management to help management create a strategic plan. Melchor was an early investor in ROLM, Software Publishing, 3Com, The Learning Company, and he was the only outside investor in Sorcim (and a member of the Board). Jim was appointed President in May 1983, followed by George Wikle, CFO. Bill Ferguson, was hired from MicroPro (the makers of WordStar) as VP of Sales, and Steve Goldsworthy joined from HP as VP Engineering. Ron Grubman was recruited as VP Corporate Development in the Summer of 1983, and the team was rounded out by Hal King, who was hired as VP Marketing. The company makes plans to move beyond CP/M SuperCalc2 shipped April 15, 1983 for CP/M machines, and a month later for CP/M-86 machines. Sales continued at a healthy upward pace, despite strong competition from Lotus 1-2-3. VisiCalc sales essentially dried up, and Sorcim management believed that SuperCalc maintained its 15% market share in a rapidly growing market. With the new management team coming together, the team focused on aggressively growing the company to maintain market visibility and power, respond to the phenomenon of Lotus 1-2-3, create a \\"killer app\\" for the IBM PC, solve the constraints of a thin capitalization and remain profitable. The marketing challenge was to create a solid relationship with IBM while generating as much revenue as possible from existing products. Simultaneously, the staff was tasked with evolving beyond a CP/M company. Work began on a new \\"killer\\" product that was to become SuperCalc3. Although well known because SuperCalc was one of the three products packaged with the wildly successful Osborne I CP/M \\"luggable\\" computer. Sorcim had no new and innovative product offerings for the breakthrough PC success, the IBM PC. SuperCalc for MS-DOS was functionally the same product as the CP/M version, which was typical for all established products at this time. Lotus 1-2-3 was the most notable exception. Failure to change focus from CP/M, where the company had almost 100% market share, to DOS, where SuperCalc simply maintained its market share, was a big mistake. New management establishes future directions The engineering organization was divided into three major efforts: # Maintain the current products including ports to new OEM computers, # Create SuperCalc3, and # Invest in a skunkworks effort that would lead to products beyond SuperCalc3. The capital structure constraints required the company to become profitable, again attain market growth and to create an exciting business plan for the future; all aimed at raising a new capital round in the early part of 1984. It seemed important to demonstrate that the new team was in control, since so many startups falter when the founders don't hand over full control to their new management teams. So while the new team came together, Richard Frank and Paul McQuesten moved a few blocks away to an office called \\"The Farm.\\" Nobody knew the location or their phone number. There were two purposes: 1) to give the new team some breathing room, and 2) to start work on a new version of a multifunction product that was code-named Oyster. Richard, Paul, and Jeff McKenna bought a Symbolics LISP machine so they could start rapid prototyping of new products. This work had previously been done on paper and at white boards. In fact, there was another project going on to define this product‚Äîa kind of skunkworks team composed of Martin Herbach, Dave Montagna (also of CDC Fortran compiler fame), and Walter Feigenson. This team got pretty far into defining what would have been a windowing system based on technology they had acquired from Payment Pouladdej and Peter Fiore‚Äîa system that appeared very similar to GEM, which was being developed by Digital Research (much to the chagrin of Payment and Peter who had shown it to Digital Research before joining Sorcim). This project died when Computer Associates acquired Sorcim. By the time SuperCalc2 shipped in April 1983, Sorcim knew that its competitor was no longer VisiCalc, but Lotus 1-2-3, which became an instant best seller in February 1983. Besides being technically excellent, 1-2-3 also had a substantially larger marketing budget than Sorcim's. As a marketing reply to this juggernaut, Sorcim crafted plans to add the features of SuperChart to the DOS version of SuperCalc, and this became SuperCalc3, which shipped in September 1983. SC3 was introduced at the CP/M show in Boston in 1983. Although some thought this venue an odd choice, Sorcim still thought at that time that it could make a \\"universal\\" version of SuperCalc3 for any CP/M machine. This turned out to be impractical because CP/M-86 did not function to hide the hardware level from the application software. At the Boston show, many industry people paid attention to Sorcim's booth, including Mitch Kapor, the founder of Lotus Development, the 1-2-3 company. SuperCalc was effectively the only competition to 1-2-3 at that point, and SC3 was vastly superior to 1-2-3 in its graphics. When Product Manager Walter Feigenson showed Kapor the product for the first time, Mitch was astounded that SC3 could do everything it did from a single disk. He even remarked that he had to reprogram 1-2-3 in Assembler to get its speed - and he wanted to know how Martin Herbach had managed to get the C-coded graphics engine to work in the middle of a non-relocatable Assembler program.(That remains a bit of unknown magic to this day.) By all accounts, Martin had achieved the impossible. SuperCalc's graphics were on a par with dedicated graphics programs (it won 3rd place in the National Software Testing Labs graphics programs competition in 1984). But good graphics weren't enough to supplant 1-2-3, and in fact the company learned that 1-2-3 users weren't even printing their graphics, since the cable for the only low-cost pen plotter was wired incorrectly. It's interesting to note that Microsoft also had a spreadsheet (MultiPlan) at this time, but the main competitors for the King of Spreadsheets remained SuperCalc3 and later versions, and 1-2-3 in its upgraded versions. Microsoft eventually abandoned MultiPlan in favor of Excel. SuperCalc3 porting sales Sorcim was very successful at selling an OEM CP/M version of SuperCalc2, and sales for 1983 zoomed to $7M including the upfront OEM payments. These were not \\"porting contracts,\\" since CP/M machines all executed the same code and used one of the 100+ standard terminals Sorcim products supported. The only difference in versions was the disk size and recording format. After SC3 shipped, the company began a successful campaign to port this graphical version to IBM \\"compatibles\\" (which mostly weren't 100% compatible at that time). At the same time, the company created a corporate sales organization. By early 1984, DOS sales dominated, and CP/M sales had eroded, and our efforts to get IBM to minimally endorse us - as they had endorsed Microsoft and Lotus ‚Äì failed. Sales to businesses were not advancing fast enough to fund our efforts. Management concluded that the company needed additional financial resources. Retail sales remained relatively steady, and the company sold some ports to other platforms that generated significant OEM revenue (some ports ran as high as $500,000). But at retail, the company was never able to make a significant dent in the 1-2-3 juggernaut. Sorcim did find a \\"sweet spot\\" in the US Government and some large companies that refused to buy software with copy protection, which was included in every copy of 1-2-3. Eventually, Lotus lost big chunks of their government business to Sorcim, and Sorcim started selling unlimited site licenses for SuperCalc and SuperWriter to firms like Ernst & Young (one of the \\"Big 8\\" accounting firms). Additional financing Throughout this time, the company continued to increase headcount to get to the \\"critical mass\\" required to be a major player in the industry. Newly acquired products, as well as home-built efforts, failed to achieve much sales success. These included SuperProject, a project management program using \\"drop down menus,\\" which was licensed from its creator Alan Cooper; and Paul McQuesten's SuperCalc3 for the Apple IIc (in native 6502 code. Revenues from compilers and products like the company's Pascal/M interpreter were drying up fast. SuperWriter, when it shipped, never sold in substantial quantities, and was limited by its ability to edit only what it could hold in memory. The company probably diluted its efforts in agreeing to ports of SuperCalc3 to Unix machines (AT&T; machines - the Unix PC, and the 3B2, which Sorcim employees referred to as the world's most expensive paperweight). Non-standard defocused efforts in the predominant market, especially on contracts they had for computers for which the company could not complete an effective port. In those days, the \\"gold standard\\" for compatibility was Compaq; everything else had differences, sometimes trivial (AT&T; had additional graphics capabilities), or massive - but every company wanted to claim IBM compatibility, and that could only be proven through software. By this time, Osborne, which never established a foothold in the DOS market, was no longer a factor in portable computers. But there were others in the works, and Sorcim worked with many of these startups. The burden of revenue for the company was always SuperCalc, no matter how the company tried to branch out. Starting with SuperCalc2, the product life cycle was tightened to 9 months. The objective was to catch up to and pass 1-2-3. By the time SuperCalc4 shipped, in 1985, the software was so refined that it was runner-up for the product of the year at PC Magazine's annual Comdex bash. PC Magazine, in its ‚ÄúBest of 1986‚Äù review had this to say: ‚ÄúIf market dominance were based on rational criteria, Computer Associates' SuperCalc 4 would certainly replace 1-2-3 as the leading spreadsheet program. After all, it can do anything that 1-2-3 can do and adds some notable features of its own.\\" By early 1984 InfoWorld estimated that Sorcim was the world's 13th-largest microcomputer- software company, with $12 million in 1983 sales. In the fall of 1983 (first closing January 1984), Sorcim raised over $9 million in private financing through Alex. Brown & Sons, but soon after concluded that Microsoft and Lotus had such dominant market shares that even more resources were required to be competitive. The company also funded a million dollar print advertising campaign in the Wall Street Journal and other national papers that failed to increase sales. In the early part of 1984, it became clear that the revenue bubble that Sorcim and substantially all of the other companies in the PC marketplace had experienced was bursting. Consequently, management re-hired Alex. Brown and Sons to find a corporate partner. In the spring of 1984, Computer Associates purchased Sorcim.

The crime and trial were covered extensively in the news media, and contributed to the government abolishing the partial defence of provocation in cases of murder. Murder Elliott and Weatherston had a romantic relationship which lasted around six months and ended before her death. In court, witnesses described the relationship as troubled. Weatherston had been an economics lecturer at the University of Otago, and also taught Elliott, who completed an honours degree in economics. On the day she died, she was packing to relocate to Wellington the next day, and start a job at the New Zealand Treasury. At around 12:30 pm on 9 January 2008, Sophie Elliott and her mother Lesley were at the family home in the suburb of Ravensbourne northeast of the city centre when Weatherston arrived unannounced, saying he had a farewell present. A short time later Lesley heard her daughter screaming. A New Zealand Police officer, Constable John Cunningham, responding to a 111 call from Lesley found Weatherston locked in Sophie's bedroom. When asked what he had done, he told the officer \\"I killed her\\". He was then arrested and taken into custody. Forensic pathologist Martin Sage performed the autopsy the next day, and found Elliott died from blood loss. Two wounds pierced her heart and one lung, with other wounds to her neck and throat severing the main artery and the major vein. In total she received 216 separate injuries, mostly stab wounds from a knife blade, with some inflicted by scissors. Additionally there were seven blunt force injuries. The pathologist found some defensive wounds, and that the attack targeted aspects of beauty and was intended to disfigure. Trial At the end of a week-long depositions hearing during May 2008 in the Dunedin High Court, Weatherston pleaded not guilty and was committed for trial by two justices of the peace. The trial moved to the Christchurch High Court for suppressed reasons, and was scheduled to start on 22 June 2009. Weatherston was represented by Judith Ablett-Kerr QC, who argued a defence of provocation. The knife used in the attack came from Weatherston's kitchen; the defence stated he carried it concealed all the time for self-defence. Two psychiatrists also appeared for the defence, stating he had narcissistic personality disorder. After a five- week trial the jury returned a verdict of guilty on 22 July, and on 15 September Justice Judith Potter sentenced Weatherston to life imprisonment with a minimum non-parole period of 18 years, saying she believed the killing was deliberate and controlled. The news media in November 2009 revealed that the victim impact statement of Sophie Elliott's father had been censored at the request of the judge, preventing him from addressing some of the claims Weatherston made during the trial. Appeal On 13 October 2009, Weatherston's lawyers filed an appeal, claiming there was a \\"lynch mob\\" mentality over his actions. On 7 April 2011, Weatherston's lawyer Robert Lithgow QC appealed the 2009 verdict before the Court of Appeal on seven grounds, including that Weatherston did not receive a fair trial due to widespread media coverage, with the magazine Listener attacking the provocation defence. Lithgow also argued that comments made by Law Commission deputy president Warren Young unduly influenced the Christchurch jury, and challenged the use of photographs of the wounds Weatherston inflicted on Elliott as exhibits. Crown prosecutor Cameron Mander opposed these arguments, pointing out that the jury had been directed to ignore media coverage of the case and that Young's attack on provocation could not be linked specifically to the Elliott murder. Elliott's parents and Sensible Sentencing Trust spokesman Garth McVicar also criticised the appeal. Three Court of Appeal judges reviewed the 2009 trial and verdict, and on 17 June 2011 denied the appeal on all seven grounds. They said that Judge Potter had directed the jury sufficiently to ignore media coverage, and that the use of the photographs did not undermine the trial's fairness. Weatherston sought leave of the Supreme Court to appeal the Court of Appeal's denial, but it rejected this on 13 September 2011. Sophie Elliott Foundation On 6 October 2010, the Sophie Elliott Foundation was launched. The aim of the foundation is to warn and educate young women of the signs of an abusive relationship. One of the trustees is Kristin Dunne-Powell, who suffered abuse at the hands of high- profile sports presenter Tony Veitch. The foundation's main aim is to raise money to fund a nationwide primary prevention programme and to support local community initiatives which align with the foundation. On 10 June 2011, Elliott's parents launched the book Sophie Elliott‚ÄîA Mother's Story of Her Family's Loss and Their Quest For Change to present her side of the story while warning young women of the dangers of domestic violence. In 2013, the foundation partnered up with the New Zealand Police and Ministry of Social Development to develop a one-day workshop for Year 12 students named Loves Me Not, to educate students on healthy relationships and prevent abusive relationships. In 2019, Elliott's mother Lesley Elliott closed the foundation, stating that her Parkinson's disease prevented her from continuing to run the foundation, and that she did not want another person controlling her daughter's image.

Shunten is the earliest chief in Okinawa for whom a name is known. He is said to have taken power after defeating a usurper to the throne by the name of Riy≈´ who had overthrown the 25th chief of the Tenson lineage. Origin Urasoe y≈çdore, mausoleum of Shunten and other Ry≈´ky≈´an rulers The Ch≈´zan Seikan (1650), the first official history of the Ry≈´ky≈´an Kingdom, and Ch≈´zan Seifu (1701) state that Shunten was the son of samurai Minamoto no Tametomo (1139‚Äì1170). Tametomo was exiled to a penal colony on Izu ≈åshima following his defeat in the H≈çgen Rebellion of 1156. According to the story, Tametomo then became lost at sea some time later, arrived on Okinawa, and settled down with the sister/daughter of the anji, or local chieftain, of ≈åzato. ≈åzato is located at the south of Okinawa Island in the present-day city of Nanj≈ç. Shunten, according to the two histories, was the son of Tametomo and the sister/daughter of the ≈åzato anji. However, these works were based purely on previous myths and were made six centuries after the alleged events probably because of the political circumstances after the Satsuma Invasion ‚Äì although still independent until the 19th century, was subordinate to the Satsuma Domain and thus intermediary to the Tokugawa shogunate. The story is inspired by political interests to connect and legitimize the relation of Japan's imperial family with Ry≈´ky≈´. In the 12th century, somekind of migration or association from the mainland Japan with the Okinawan chieftains probably happened, but as the historical and archeological-traditional evidence indicate men from the defeated Taira clan who fled Minamoto's clan vengeance, at the time of mythological-historical writing in 17th century, was mentioned Tametomo who was from the same Minamoto clan as the Tokugawa's sh≈çguns. During the Meiji period, the myth was considered as an official and historical fact, especially in the constructed narrative Memorandum of Japan's sovereign rights to Ry≈´ky≈´, in response to the Chinese government's protest, as an evidence which concluded the Ryukyus relationship with Japan, and for the Japanese \\"legitimacy\\" and \\"sovereign right\\" of the annexation of the Ryukyu Kingdom in 1879. Early life and reign Shunten was known as Sonton (Â∞äÊï¶) prior to becoming king. He became anji of Urasoe in 1180 at the age of 15 after gathering a base of popular support in the area. In 1187, he overthrew Riy≈´ and established his royal seat of power at Urasoe Castle, marking the beginning of a new line of rulers. Shunten's reign was long and progressive; by legend he is said to have ruled for 51 years.

It was built in 1884 for Lt-Col William James Scarlett, and the extensive gardens were laid out by Sir James Horlick from 1944. The house is protected as a category B listed building, while the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland. History The island of Gigha was formerly the property of the Clan McNeill until John Carstairs MacNeill, who sold the island in 1856 to James Williams Scarlett, second son of William Anglin Scarlett, for ¬£49,000. James Scarlett's son, Lt-Col William James Scarlett, a veteran of the Crimean War like his cousin William Scarlett, 3rd Baron Abinger, built Achamore House in 1884. The house was designed by John Honeyman of Honeyman and Keppie Architects. After it was damaged by fire in 1896, John Honeyman was again employed to restore and remodel the house, which was completed in 1900. The island remained in the Scarlett family until 1919 when it was sold to a Major John Allen, and subsequently bought in 1937 by Richard and Elaine Hamer (n√©e de Chair), daughter of Admiral Sir Dudley de Chair. During the Second World War it passed to Elaine Hamer's brother, Somerset de Chair, who sold it on to Colonel Sir James Horlick in 1944, who bought the island in order to extend his plant collection, which he had been developing at Titness Park in Berkshire. He undertook plantings across some of gardens surrounding the house. The estate was again sold in 1973 after Horlick's death to James Landale, but the plant collection was given to the National Trust for Scotland. The next owner in 1989 was Malcolm Potier, followed by the Holt family until in 2002 the island was purchased by its residents, and ownership of the house and gardens passed to the Isle of Gigha Heritage Trust. In order to pay back loans used for the community buy-out, the house was sold in 2003 and now operates as bed and breakfast accommodation. The property was relisted for sale in 2012, and appears still to be for sale at present (March 2019), with an asking price requesting offers over ¬£795,000.http://search.savills.com/property- detail/gbglrsgls100160#/r/detail/GBGLRSGLS100160http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property- for-sale/property-36024598.html Rhododendrons in flower at Achamore Gardens The Achamore Gardens are owned by the Heritage Trust, and are open to the public.

Known for his efforts in fighting for the cause of India's traditional fishermen, he was called \\"a senior sage of India's environmental and social justice movements\\" by the New Internationalist. Kocherry served as chairperson of the National Fishworkers' Forum, the coordinator of the World Forum of Fish Harvesters and Fish Workers and National Alliance of People's Movements (NAMP). Kocherry was instrumental in mobilizing more than ten million fishermen in South India, and efforts to stop factory fishing and use of mechanized trawls for the purpose. Recognizing his efforts toward the same, Kocherry was given the Earth Trustee award in 1998. In 1999, he received the Sophie Prize, a Norwegian award for environment and sustainable development. He was also a vocal critic of globalization in India.  Early life  Kocherry was born on 11 May 1940 in Changanassery, a town in present-day Kottayam district of the Indian State of Kerala, to Aleyamma and Vavachan Kocherry. He had ten siblings. Kocherry graduated in Science and Law. He earned a bachelor's degree in science from St. Berchmans College, Changanassery, and in law from Government Law College, Thiruvananthapuram.  Career  Kocherry was ordained a priest in April 1971 before he joined the Redemptorist Congregation. He was inspired by its founder Alphonsus Liguori, who left his legal profession to work among poor shepherds in Italy. Kocherry began activism that year in Raiganj, a fishing village, on the Bangladesh‚ÄìIndia border. He moved to Poonthura in Thiruvananthapuram from there, to fight for the cause of Kerala's traditional fishermen. In the mid-1970s, during the period of emergency, he founded the Boat Workers' Union in Kerala's coastal town of Anchuthengu before getting involved with the Trivandrum Independent Fish Workers' Union, indicating his role as a trade union leader. He also helped found the Kerala Swatantra Matsyathozhilali Federation. In 1981, Kocherry undertook an eleven-day fast with his associate Joyachan Antony demanding a ban on mechanized trawling during the monsoon season. Consequently, the Kerala Marine Fishing Regulation Act was enacted with a directive to keep large vessels off the coastline. In 1982, the National Fishworkers' Forum (NFF) was formed to further these causes, including organizing protests and fighting legal battles against large fleets and polluting industries. He felt, \\"Trawling is destructive because it disrupts the sea-bed and purse seiners which net shoals of fish are responsible for over- fishing\\". He added, \\"Unless the government takes immediate action, we may not have any fish left either to eat or to export.\\" Under Kocherry's leadership, the NFF organized the 'Kanyakumari March' in 1989 against the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant; around 25,000 people participated. He served as its chairperson from its formation till 1996. Kocherry was instrumental in the formation of the National Fisheries Action Committee Against Joint Ventures, with the onset of economic liberalisation in 1991. He felt it led to an increase \\"fleets and polluting industries along the coasts of developing countries\\". That year, the Supreme Court ruled a case over the government's joint venture or deep sea fishing policy that envisaged to open India's waters to large commercial vessels, in the NFF's favour. Consequently, in 1996, all coastal infrastructure were asked to be demolished allowing traditional fishing practices to continue. However, the government found a way to circumvent the Court's ruling, and introduced a bill in the mid-1990s. In a statement to the United Nations and world leaders, Kocherry called for a global ban on factory trawlers. In November 1998, Kocherry became the first Indian to be awarded a Pew Fellowship in Conservation and the Environment, which carried a purse of 150,000, for his contribution for protecting marine life. However, he rejected the award and said that \\"a polluter giving an award for marine conservation is a contradiction\\", considering that Sunoco, which instituted the award, was hitherto an oil exploration company. A few days later, when the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests constituted the National Coastal Zone Management Authority, Kocherry was appointed one of its members for a two-year term.  Critic of globalization  A vocal critic of globalization, Kocherry called it \\"the free movement of capital to generate profits for a few at the expense of the vast majority of people\\". He added, \\"I took up empowering the victims of globalization as a cause\\". Kocherry argued that although globalization was accompanied by the rhetoric of decentralization, it centralized the flow of profits and power to the G7 countries. He also remarked that the governments were playing into the hands of pro-foreign domination and pro-investment agencies such as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund, through their policies for free movement of capital, that he felt was contradictory to the principles behind Mahatma Gandhi's Salt March of 1930. Kocherry advocated \\"political action to establish fisherpeoples' sovereignty over the sea and its wealth\\" and the \\"need to think globally and act globally to counter the onslaught from the MNCs and TNCs\\".

Uses The rhyme is a rule of thumb used for weather forecasting during the past two millennia. It is based on the reddish glow of the morning or evening sky, caused by trapped particles scattering the blue light from the sun in a stable air mass.\\"Met Office UK\\"https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/learn-about/weather/how-weather- works/red-sky-at-night 08/02/2020 If the morning skies are of an orange-red glow, it signifies a high-pressure air mass with stable air-trapping particles, like dust, which scatters the sun's blue light. This high pressure is moving towards the east, and a low-pressure system moves in from the west. Conversely, in order to see \\"red sky\\" in the evening, high-pressure air mass from the west scatters the blue light in the atmospheric particles, leaving the orange-red glow. High-pressure air mass signifies stable weather, while low pressure signifies unstable weather. There are occasions where a storm system might rain itself out before reaching the observer (who had seen the morning red sky). For ships at sea, however, the wind and rough seas from an approaching storm system could still be a problem, even without rainfall. Because of different prevailing wind patterns around the globe, the traditional rhyme is generally not correct at lower latitudes of both hemispheres, where prevailing winds are from east to west. The rhyme is generally correct at middle latitudes where, due to the rotation of the Earth, prevailing winds travel west to east. Other versions Red sky at morning, at sea There are variations of the phrase, some including the plural word \\"sailors\\": > Red sky at night, sailors' delight. Red sky at morning, sailors' warning. Another version uses the word \\"shepherds\\": > Red sky at night, shepherds' delight. Red sky in the morning, shepherds' > warning. Another version uses \\"pink\\" in place of \\"red\\": > Pink sky at night, sailors' delight. Pink sky in the morning, sailors take > warning. Another version uses \\"forlorn\\" in place of \\"warning\\": > Red sky at night, sailors' delight. Red sky in the morn', sailors' forlorn. In Matthew 16:2b‚Äì3, Jesus says: > When it is evening, you say, \\"It will be fair weather; for the sky is red.\\" > And in the morning, \\"It will be stormy today, for the sky is red and > threatening.\\" See also * Diffraction * Sunrise * Weather lore * \\"Red Skies\\" References External links *This old saying actually has a scientific explanation National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Earth System Research Laboratory * Everyday Mysteries, Library of Congress Category: Adages Category: Weather lore Category: Maritime folklore ","title":"Red sky at morning"},{"id":"24673646","text":"Shaku may refer to: * Shaku (unit) * Shaku (ritual baton) * Shaku, Iran, a village in Markazi Province, Iran ","title":"Shaku"},{"id":"24673656","text":"The 1952 Claxton Shield was the 13th annual Claxton Shield, it was held in Perth, Western Australia.

Origin The Hu was originally used at court for the taking of notes and was usually made of bamboo. Officials could record speaking notes on the tablet ahead of the audience, and record the emperor's instructions during the audience. Likewise the emperor could use it for notes during ceremonies. It eventually became a ritual implement. It also became customary for officials to shield their mouths with their hu when speaking to the emperor. The hu can be made of different material according to the holder's rank: sovereigns used jade (similar to, but not the same as, the ceremonial jade sceptre, gui (Âú≠)), nobles used ivory, and court officials used bamboo. Japanese shaku is usually made of woods like Japanese yew, holly, cherry, sakaki, or Japanese cedar. It also became a religious instrument in Taoism and Shintoism. The Buddhist god King Yama, judge of the underworld, is often depicted bearing the hu. The hu, or shaku, is often seen in portraits of Chinese Mandarins, Japanese sh≈çguns, emperors, and noblemen, but is now used mostly by Taoist priests and Shinto priests (the kannushi). Use in China The use of the hu as a ritual baton originated in ancient China, where the Classic of Rites required a hu to have a length of two chi six cun, (and its) mid part has a width of three cun (\\"Á¨èÈï∑‰∫åÂ∞∫ÂÖ≠ÂØ∏Ôºå‰∏≠ÂÆΩ‰∏âÂØ∏„ÄÇ\\"). In China it was customary to hold the hu with the broad end down and the narrow end up. This is the opposite of Japanese practice. From the Jin dynasty onwards, with the proliferation of paper, the hu became a ceremonial instrument. During the Tang dynasty, court etiquette required officials to wear the hu in their belts when riding horses.„ÄäËàäÂîêÊõ∏‚ÄßÂºµ‰πùÈΩ°ÂÇ≥„ÄãË®òËºâÔ∏∞\\"ÊïÖ‰∫ãÔ∏∞ÁöÜÊê¢Á¨èÊñºÂ∏∂ÔºåËÄåÂæå‰πòÈ¶¨Ôºå‰πùÈΩ°È´îÁæ∏ÔºåÂ∏∏‰Ωø‰∫∫ÊåÅ‰πãÔºåÂõ†Ë®≠Á¨èÂõä„ÄÇ\\" The chancellor was provided with a hu rack, which was carried into the palace. After an audience, the hu could be left on the rack. Lesser officials had hu bags, which were held by their attendants.„Ää‰∫ë‰ªôÊùÇËÆ∞¬∑Á¨èÂõäÁ¨èÊû∂„ÄãÔºö\\" ‰ºöÊòå‰ª•Êù•ÔºåÂÆ∞Áõ∏ÊúùÂàôÊúâÁ¨èÊû∂ÔºåÂÖ•Á¶Å‰∏≠ÔºåÈÄêÈó®‰º†ÈÄÅËá≥ÊÆøÂâçÔºåÊúùÁΩ¢ÂàôÁΩÆ‰∫éÊû∂‰∏ä„ÄÇÁôæÂØÆÂàôÂêÑÊúâÁ¨èÂõäÔºå‰∫≤ÂêèÊåÅ‰πã„ÄÇ During the early Tang dynasty, mandarins of the fifth rank or above used ivory hu, while those below used wooden ones. The rules were further elaborated later to require that mandarins of the third rank or above used hu which were curved at the front and straight at the back, while those of the fifth rank or above used hu which were curved at the front and angled at the back. The hu used by lower rank mandarins were made of bamboo and were angled at the top and square at the bottom. In the Ming dynasty, mandarins of the fourth rank or above used ivory hu, while those of the fifth rank or below used wooden ones.„ÄäÊ≠£Â≠óÈÄö„Äã‰∏äËºâÔ∏∞\\"ÊòéÂà∂ÔºåÁ¨èÔºåÂõõÂìÅ‰ª•‰∏äÁî®Ë±°ÁâôÔºå‰∫îÂìÅ‰ª•‰∏ãÁî®Êú®„ÄÇ\\" The hu fell out of use in the Qing dynasty. The greater ceremonial deference demanded by Qing emperors meant that officials had to greet the emperor by kowtowing, making it impractical to carry the hu to an audience. Use in Japan The standard reading in Japanese for the character used to write shaku is kotsu, but that is also one of the readings for the character and is thus avoided to prevent bad luck.Iwanami Japanese dictionary, 6th Edition (2008), DVD version The character's unusual pronunciation seems to derive from the fact the baton is approximately one shaku (an old unit of measurement equivalent to 30.3 cm) in length. A shaku or is a baton or scepter about 35 cm long held vertically in the right hand, and was traditionally part of a nobleman's formal attire (the sokutai, see photo). Today it is used however mostly by Shinto priests during functions, not only with a sokutai but with other types of formal clothing as the J≈çe, the and the . The emperor's shaku is more-or-less square at both ends, whereas a retainer's is rounded at the top and square at the bottom. Both become progressively narrow towards the bottom. Oak is considered the best, followed in order by holly, cherry, sakaki, and Japanese cedar. The shaku originally had a strip of paper attached to the back containing instructions and memoranda for the ceremony or event about to take place, but it later evolved into a purely ceremonial implement meant to add solemnity to rituals. According to the Taih≈ç Code, a set of administrative laws implemented in the year 701, nobles of the fifth rank and above had to use an ivory shaku, while those below that rank were to use oak, Japanese yew, holly, cherry, sakaki, Japanese cedar, or other woods. Ivory, however, was too hard to obtain, and the law was changed. The Engishiki, a Japanese book of laws and regulations written in 927, permits to all the use of shaku of unfinished wood, except when wearing special ceremonial clothes called .

Origins He was born at Bere Regis in Dorset, a younger son of John Turberville and his wife Isabella, daughter of John Cheverell. John was a great-grandson of Sir Robert Turberville (d. 6 Aug. 1424) of Bere and Anderston. The Turberville family also held the manor of South Molton in Devon in the mediaeval era. Sir Payn de Turberville, Lord of Coity Castle in Glamorganshire, was one of the legendary Twelve Knights of Glamorgan who conquered that county under Robert FitzHamon (d.1107), Lord of Glamorgan. Career James was educated at Winchester College, and in 1512 was elected fellow of New College, Oxford, where he graduated B.A. on 17 June 1516 and M.A. on 26 June 1520. He graduated D.D. abroad, but was incorporated on 1 June 1532. From 1521 to 1524 he filled the office of 'tabellio' or Registrar of the University of Oxford. In 1529 he resigned his fellowship, being then promoted to an ecclesiastical benefice, and in 1541 he became rector of Hartfield in Sussex. On 8 September 1555 he was consecrated bishop of Exeter as successor to John Voysey. According to John Hooker, Turberville was concerned in the execution for heresy of Agnes Pirest, burned at Southampton. In Elizabeth I's initial parliament he opposed the bill for restoring tenths and first-fruits to the crown, as well as other anti-papal measures. In 1559 he declined the oath of supremacy, and in consequence was deprived, a fresh cong√© d'√©lire being issued on 27 April 1560. On 4 December 1559 he joined the other deprived bishops in a letter of remonstrance, and on 18 June 1560 he was committed for a short time to the Tower of London. He was afterwards placed in the custody of Edmund Grindal, bishop of London, and liberated by order of the privy council on 30 January 1565 on sureties for good behaviour. The rest of his life was passed in retirement, and he died at liberty, it is said, in 1570.

Design The J/80 was designed by J/Boats' Rod Johnstone, and was designed to be a one-design sportsboat that was both easy to sail and safe, but capable of reaching 20 knots downwind. The J/80 is the only sportsboat to be certified for Design Category 'B' of the EU Recreational Craft Directive, which means it can withstand waves that are high and in winds up to 41 knots. This gives the J/80 a reputation of being a very well built boat for its size, capable of extreme weather conditions. Due to the J/80 having an asymmetrical spinnaker with a retractable bowsprit, there is little clutter on the deck and in the cockpit, giving the crew more space and fewer tripping hazards on board.

The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1763 Centuria Insectorum. It is found in large parts of the tropics, mainly in Asia, Africa and Australia but introduced into other areas such as Hawaii, New Zealand and the Society Islands. It is one of major fruit pests in the world. Description The wingspan is about 80‚Äì94 mm in male. Palpi with third joint long and spatulate at extremity. Forewings with non-crenulate cilia in male, crenulate in female. Head and thorax reddish brown with plum-color suffusion. Abdomen orange. Forewings reddish brown, usually with a greenish tinge and irrorated with dark specks. An oblique antemedial line present, which is generally dark and indistinct but sometimes pale and prominent. Reniform indistinct. A curve postmedial line found, which is almost always met by an oblique streak from apex. Hindwings orange, with a large black lunule beyond lower angle of cell. There is a marginal black band with cilia pale spots runs from costa to vein 2. Ventral side of forewings with orange postmedial band. The wingspan is about 90‚Äì110 mm in female. Female has much more variegated and dark reddish brown striated forewings. Reniform dark and sending a spur along median nervure to below the orbicular speck. There is a triangular white mark usually present on the postmedial line below vein 3. Larva has dilated 11th somite and surrounded by a tubercle. Body purplish brown, where dorsum brown from 6th to 11th somites. Legs red and spiracular scarlet patches largest posteriorly and with some irregular white markings round them, on somite 9 in the form of an oblique white bar. There is a yellow sub-basal mark found on 4th somite. Fifth and sixth somites have black ocelli with yellow iris and white pupils. Two yellow patches can be seen on 11th somite. The adult is considered an agricultural pest, causing damage to many fruit crops by piercing it with its strong proboscis in order to suck the juice. Attempts have been made to control them using baits for the adults, egg parasites and larval parasitoids. Ecology The larvae feed mainly on vines belonging to the Menispermaceae but have also adapted to species of Erythrina and are known to feed on Erythrina crista-galli, Erythrina fusca, Erythrina variegata, Carronia multisepala, Hypserpa decumbens, Legnephora moorei, Pleogyne australis, Sarcopetalum harveyanum, Stephania aculeata, Stephania forsteri, Stephania japonica and Tinospora smilacina. Infected plant parts are mostly the fruits. Fruits show sap ooze out and internal feeding of the caterpillar. Fruits may show premature drop. Adults penetrate the skin or rind with a strong, barbed proboscis. Damaged parts become spongy and with many lesions.

Scenery of the Aberdeen Floating Village. Aberdeen floating village is located at the Aberdeen Harbour in the Southern District of Hong Kong. The harbor is known to contain 600 junks and is home to 6,000 people.  Aberdeen  Since the 19th century, Aberdeen emerged as one of the most important fishing ports in Hong Kong. In the past two decades, the population of the Aberdeen Floating Village community has decreased due to rapid fisheries development in the nearby Guangdong Province and the increase in operating costs of the fishing industry in Hong Kong. Presently, the majority of the boat people use the boat to fish during the day instead of making it their permanent abode. Most of the descendants of the floating people have chosen to relocate to high-rise accommodations on dry land. Prior to the 1950s, salt fish was the major catch sold at Aberdeen.\\"Development of the Fishing Industry in Aberdeen\\" from sign at Aberdeen Floating Village, Published by: Southern District Council, Hong Kong. Date visited: October 12, 2009. Today, Aberdeen is the only fishing port in the Southern District in Hong Kong. It continues to play an important role in the fishing industry. The catch of fish in the Aberdeen port accounts for over one-third of the total catch of fish in Hong Kong. During the Fishing Moratorium Period (June and July), more than 1,000 fishing vessels are anchored at the Aberdeen Typhoon Shelter. Boat people in Hong Kong The people living on boats in Aberdeen are mainly Tanka, a group which arrived in Hong Kong around the 7th to 9th century. The word \\"Tanka\\" literally means egg people and was used to describe how this ethnic group paid taxes with eggs instead of money. While the term Tanka is used by the boat-dweller themselves, it is not accepted when used by someone from outside of the community for its derogatory connotation. Aside from the Tanka, there is another ethnic group in the floating village called Hoklo and these people originally came from Fujian province. The Tanka and Hoklo ethnic groups did not always get along. While sometimes referred to as \\"boat people\\", they are in fact boat dwellers and should not be confused with the unrelated Vietnamese refugees boat people, who came to Hong Kong by boat in the 1970s.Architectural Conservation Office, HKSAR Government. (2008).

Aberdeen's role as a port emerged between the 14th and 17th centuries when sandalwood (taang heung muk) arrived in junks from Lantau Island and Sha Tin. The waters of Aberdeen served as the intermediary, dispatching the sandalwood into larger boats up the East China coast to major cities in China. Aberdeen boat people are well known for their floating restaurants which serve fresh seafood caught directly from their own boats. Each floating restaurant serves different types of seafood, each with a unique Cantonese cuisine flavor. Some boat people sell fresh seafood, dried fish and salt fish on their respective boats along the coast.  Dragon Boat Race  Dragon boat racing in Hong Kong commenced in the 1900s. The Duanwu Festival that takes place in the fifth day of the fifth month in the Lunar calendar is an event of tremendous importance to Hong Kong fishermen. Fishermen think that rowing dragon boats during the Duanwu festival will bring them luck. Each boat carries with it 48 paddlers. Aberdeen is a pioneer in hosting dragon boat races. Aberdeen hosts the Dragon Boat race each year and receives a lot of community support.\\"Customs of Fishermen\\" from sign at Aberdeen Floating Village, Published by: Southern District Council, Hong Kong. Date visited: October 12, 2009.  Lifestyle  A family living on a boat. Although Aberdeen has now been transformed into a semi-commercial district, it has maintained the style of a fishing village. Some of the residents actively engage in boat activities and mainly rely on the boat for daily living. Some common boat people activities include fish salt-processing, washing fish and driving, and serving as tour guides on the sightseeing sampans on the waterfront.  Boat restaurants  Some boat people are employed at the boat restaurants which sell fresh seafood mainly for tourists. The chefs in the restaurants use traditional methods of cooking fresh seafood to provide tourists with a taste of Aberdeen.  Sightseeing sampans  Sightseeing Sampans map. Some boat people drive and serve as tour guides for sightseeing sampans on the waterfront. When people are walking along the shore, the boat people would invite them for boat travel to some small islands nearby or the surrounding area for 20 to 30 minutes.\\"Lifestyles of Fishermen\\" from sign at Aberdeen Floating Village, Published by: Southern District Council, Hong Kong. Date visited: October 12, 2009. The tour guide would introduce the scenic and special points of those areas to the tourists during the ride. The ride costs $50 to $80 Hong Kong dollars.  Fish catching  At least once a day, boat people drive their boats out to the surrounding areas to catch fish. The catch is handed over to the wholesalers in the Fish Marketing Organization (F.M.O) for further wholesaling, or simply sell them directly to wet markets or seafood restaurants.  Non-boat people  There are many other people in Aberdeen who neither live nor work on boats.‚ÄúA short guide to Aberdeen.‚Äù from sign at Aberdeen Floating Village, Published by: Southern District Council, Hong Kong. Date visited: October 12, 2009. Most of these people consume fresh seafood from small-scale fish boats, or go to seafood restaurants to dine. There are two famous floating restaurants in Aberdeen: the Jumbo Floating Restaurant and the Tai Pak Floating Restaurant. In addition to food, non-boat people also go to the marine parks at the waterfront for leisure activities, such as doing exercise, stretching or simply chatting with their neighbors.  Methods  Trawling is the most common method used by the fishermen in the South and East China seas. The type of trawling method used depends on which type of fish the fisherman intends to catch.\\"Fishing Methods\\" from sign at Aberdeen Floating Village, Published by: Southern District Council, Hong Kong. Date visited: October 12, 2009. For catching other marine animals, different methods are used. For the gill-netting operation, the fish boat would pull a long net at its back, where the fish will flow into. For the seine fishing operation, fishermen will place a rounded net into the sea when they see a school of fish swim by. The long-lining operation consists of the fish boat pulling a string, tagged with little fish, to attract and lure the fish into the string.  Shrimp catching  To catch shrimp, fishermen use the shrimp trawling operation, during which they would throw small bags into the sea to catch shrimp.  Fishing junks  Shrimp trawlers are used to catch shrimp using the shrimp-trawling method. However, shrimp trawlers only account for a very small portion of trawlers in Hong Kong. Currently, the most common trawlers in Hong Kong are the Hang Trawlers, Sten Trawlers, Purse Seniers and Gill-Netters. All of these local fishing boat junks were mechanized after the Pacific War.Drying salt fish caught in the waters of Aberdeen.  The Fish Marketing Organization  The fish market at the Aberdeen floating village organized by the F.M.O. The Fish Marketing Organization (F.M.O) is a self- financed, non-profit organization that provides marketing services to fishermen and fish retailers at the Aberdeen floating village.\\"Development of the Fish Marketing Organization\\" from sign at Aberdeen Floating Village, Published by: Southern District Council, Hong Kong. Date visited: October 12, 2009. F.M.O's income derives from the commission on sales and surplus earnings. F.M.O's earnings are used to improve the facilities of the Aberdeen Floating Village. Wholesale fish markets operated by the F.M.O are located along the Aberdeen Promenade.  Fish ball noodles  A bowl of \\"Fish Ball Noodles\\" with fish balls, meatballs and fish spring rolls. Every morning the Aberdeen boat people catch fresh fish to make fish balls. These fish balls are used to create the local Aberdeen specialty, the 'Fish Ball Noodles'. Boat people use traditional and other unique ways of cooking the fish ball noodles. Every evening at 6, people from all over Hong Kong come and visit the village to enjoy the delicacy.  Tourism  The fishing port of Aberdeen has been a major tourist attraction to the local population and tourists alike due its scenery and seafood. The Hong Kong Tourist Association and the government of Hong Kong have been active in promoting Aberdeen, which benefits the catering and travel industries in the area.\\"Development of tourism in Aberdeen.\\" from sign at Aberdeen Floating Village, Published by: Southern District Council, Hong Kong.

Aberdeen Country Park  The Aberdeen Country Park is built around the reservoirs on the southern side of Hong Kong. The Aberdeen Country Park flourishes in leisure trails and attractive promenades. The longest trail can actually be completed within an hour. The Aberdeen Country Park is more than just a park; in more practical terms, the Hong Kong Tourist Association has established an information centre in the park‚Äôs southern section for the documentation of informative pamphlets, further contributing to the educational sector of the park.  Aberdeen Tin Hau Temple  The Tin Hau Temple in Aberdeen was founded in 1851, and it serves the purpose of commemorating Tin Hau. Every April, the temple flourishes with ceremonies for the purpose of celebrating Tin Hau's birthday. During the ceremony, people decorate their boats on the Aberdeen shores and lion dances are performed outside the temple.

The Schreier graph encodes the abstract structure of a group modulo an equivalence relation formed by the coset. The graph is named after Otto Schreier, who used the term ‚ÄúNebengruppenbild‚Äù. An equivalent definition was made in an early paper of Todd and Coxeter. Description The vertices of the graph are the right cosets Hg = { hg : h in H } for g in G. The edges of the graph are of the form (Hg,Hgxi). The Cayley graph of the group G with {xi : i in I} is the Schreier coset graph for H = {1G} . A spanning tree of a Schreier coset graph corresponds to a Schreier transversal, as in Schreier's subgroup lemma . The book \\"Categories and Groupoids\\" listed below relates this to the theory of covering morphisms of groupoids. A subgroup H of a group G determines a covering morphism of groupoids p: K \\\\rightarrow G and if X is a generating set for G then its inverse image under p is the Schreier graph of (G,X). Applications The graph is useful to understand coset enumeration and the Todd‚ÄìCoxeter algorithm. Coset graphs can be used to form large permutation representations of groups and were used by Graham Higman to show that the alternating groups of large enough degree are Hurwitz groups, . Every vertex-transitive graph is a coset graph.  References    Schreier graphs of the Basilica group Authors: Daniele D'Angeli, Alfredo Donno, Michel Matter, Tatiana Nagnibeda * Philip J.

He was associated with the University of Chicago for over half a century, and co- founded the Committee there in 1941. Early life Nef was born in 1899. He was a native Chicagoan. He graduated from Harvard University in 1920.Samuels (2005), p. 59 He finished a PhD degree at the Robert Brookings Graduate School in Washington, D.C. (a precursor of the Brookings Institution) in 1927. He served at Swarthmore College's faculty for a year. He joined the University of Chicago's faculty in 1929 as an assistant professor of economics. Career in academia After joining the faculty at Chicago in 1929, he was associated with the university for over half a century. He became professor of economic history there in 1936. He also served as a visiting professor at French universities, Institut d'√©tudes politiques and the Coll√®ge de France, and also lectured at the universities of Belfast and Houston. Committee on Social Thought In 1941 Nef co-founded the Committee on Social Thought at Chicago along with Frank Knight, Robert Redfield, and Robert M. Hutchins (who was then president of the University of Chicago). It is an elite interdisciplinary graduate department at Chicago. He served as executive secretary and also as chairman (1945-1964) of the Committee. He brought a number of distinguished people he had encountered in his travels abroad such as Marc Chagall, T. S. Eliot, Igor Stravinsky, and Jacques Maritain to the Committee. Work as an economic historian Nef went on to become a foremost economic historian. His largest domain of interest was the Western Europe's economic, cultural, and military history since the end of the 15th century. He was involved in the study of the comparative economic histories of Britain and France; his most intense being the French economic history. His early work on the coal industry of Britain and the early Industrial Revolution in Britain during the 16th and 17th century is particularly important. His work indicated that the Industrial Revolution was a long-time evolutionary process. He was also one of the first economic historians who paid serious attention to technology.Samuels (2005), p. 60 Publication He was an author of a number of books which include Industry and Government In France and England 1540-1640 (1940), The United States and Civilization (1967), The Rise of the British Coal Industry (1966), The Conquest of the Material World (1964), and Search for Meaning: Autobiography of a Non-Conformist (1973). Later life Apart from being an economic historian, Nef was also an officer of the French Legion of Honor, a philanthropist, and patron of the arts. In 1979 the Society for the History of Technology awarded him the Leonardo da Vinci Medal, and in 1980 he received the University of Chicago Medal. He died at his home in Washington, D.C. at the age of 89, after a long illness, in 1988.

He was the commander of the UVF's Mid-Ulster Brigade from 1975 to the early 1990s, when Billy Wright took over as leader. From his home in the small village of Donaghcloney, County Down, five miles southeast of Lurgan, Jackson is alleged to have organised and committed a series of killings, mainly against Catholic civilians, although he was never convicted in connection with any killing and never served any lengthy prison terms. At least 50 killings in Northern Ireland have been attributed to him, according to Stephen Howe (New Statesman) and David McKittrick (Lost Lives). An article by Paul Foot in Private Eye suggested that Jackson led one of the teams that bombed Dublin on 17 May 1974, killing 26 people, including two infants. Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Patrol Group (SPG) officer John Weir (who was also involved in loyalist killings), also maintained this in an affidavit. The information from Weir's affidavit was published in 2003 in the Barron Report, the findings of an official investigation into the Dublin bombings commissioned by Irish Supreme Court Justice Henry Barron. Journalist Kevin Dowling in the Irish Independent alleged that Jackson had headed the gang that perpetrated the Miami Showband killings, which left three members of the cabaret band dead and two wounded. Journalist Joe Tiernan and the Pat Finucane Centre alleged this as well as Jackson's involvement in the Dublin bombings. When questioned about the latter, Jackson denied involvement. Findings noted in a report by the Historical Enquiries Team (HET) (released in December 2011) confirmed that Jackson was linked to the Miami Showband attack through his fingerprints, which had been found on the silencer specifically made for the Luger pistol used in the shootings. Jackson was a former member of the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR), but had been discharged from the regiment for undisclosed reasons. It was stated by Weir, as well as by others including former British Army psychological warfare operative Major Colin Wallace, that Jackson was an RUC Special Branch agent. Early life and UDR career Jackson was born into a Church of Ireland family in the small hamlet of the mainly Protestant Donaghmore, County Down, Northern Ireland on 27 September 1948, the son of John Jackson and Eileen Muriel. Some time later, he went to live in the Mourneview Estate in Lurgan, County Armagh before making his permanent home in the village of Donaghcloney, County Down, southeast of Lurgan. Jackson made a living by working in a shoe factory and delivering chickens for the Moy Park food processing company throughout most of the 1970s. The conflict known as \\"the Troubles\\" erupted in Northern Ireland in the late 1960s, and people from both sides of the religious/political divide were soon caught up in the maelstrom of violence that ensued. In 1972, Jackson joined the locally recruited Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR), an infantry regiment of the British Army, in Lurgan. He was attached to 11th Battalion UDR. On 23 October 1972, a large cache of guns and ammunition was stolen during an armed raid by the illegal Ulster loyalist paramilitary organisation, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), on King's Park camp, a UDR/Territorial Army depot. It is alleged by the Pat Finucane Centre, a Derry-based civil rights group, that Jackson took part in the raid while a serving member of the UDR.Collusion in the South Armagh/Mid Ulster Area in the mid-1970s Journalist Scott Jamison also echoed this allegation in an article in the North Belfast News,Scott Jamison. \\"UDR guns used in murder of Catholic workmen\\". North Belfast News, 27 September 2010. retrieved 30 April 2011 as did David McKittrick in his book Lost Lives. UVF history Around the same time Jackson was expelled from the regiment for undisclosed reasons, he joined the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade's Lurgan unit. The UVF drew its greatest strength as well as the organisation's most ruthless members from its Mid-Ulster Brigade, according to journalist Brendan O'Brien.O'Brien, Brendan (1999). The Long War: The IRA and Sein Fein, Second Edition. Syracuse, N.Y: Syracuse University Press. p. 92. Google Books; retrieved 6 March 2011 The Pat Finucane Centre's allegation that he had taken part in the UVF's 23 October 1972 raid on the UDR/TA depot indicates that he was most likely already an active UVF member prior to being dismissed from the UDR. Anne Cadwallader states in her 2013 book Lethal Allies that Jackson was expelled from the UDR on 4 March 1974;Gerry Moriarty. \\"Loyalism's most prolific sectarian killer may have enjoyed indefensible relationship with RUC officers\\", The Irish Times, 25 October 2013; retrieved 29 October 2013. by then he was discernibly involved in UVF activity. As the Provisional IRA continued to wage its militant campaign across Northern Ireland throughout 1972, many loyalists felt their community was under attack and their status was being threatened and sought to retaliate against Irish nationalists and republicans by joining one of the two main loyalist paramilitary organisations, the illegal UVF or the legal Ulster Defence Association (UDA). The proscription against the UVF was lifted by Merlyn Rees, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, on 4 April 1974. It remained a legal organisation until 3 October 1975, when it was once again banned by the British government. Many members of loyalist paramilitary groups such as the UVF and UDA managed to join the UDR despite the vetting process. Their purpose in doing so was to obtain weapons, training and intelligence. Vetting procedures were carried out jointly by the Intelligence Corps and the RUC Special Branch and if no intelligence was found to suggest unsuitability, individuals were passed for recruitment and would remain as soldiers until the commanding officer was provided with intelligence enabling him to remove soldiers with paramilitary links or sympathies.CAIN Archive:Public Records: Subversion in the UDR Operating mainly around the Lurgan and Portadown areas, the Mid-Ulster Brigade had been set up in 1972 in Lurgan by Billy Hanna, who appointed himself commander.

Hanna was a decorated war hero, having won the Military Medal for gallantry in the Korean War when he served with the Royal Ulster Rifles. He later joined the UDR, serving as a permanent staff instructor (PSI) and holding the rank of sergeant. According to David McKittrick, he was dismissed from the regiment two years later \\"for UVF activity\\"; The regimental history of the UDR confirms thisPotter, John Furniss (2001). A Testimony to Courage: The Regimental History of the Ulster Defence Regiment 1969‚Äì1992. Pen & Sword Books, Ltd. p. 90 although journalist/author Martin Dillon states in his book, The Dirty War, that at the time of his death Hanna was still a member of the UDR. Hanna's unit formed part of the \\"Glenanne gang\\", a loose alliance of loyalist extremists which allegedly functioned under the direction of the Intelligence Corps and/or RUC Special Branch.The Cassel Report (2006), pp. 8, 14, 21, 25, 51, 56, 58‚Äì65. It comprised rogue elements of the RUC and its Special Patrol Group (SPG), the UDR, the UDA, as well as the UVF. The Pat Finucane Centre, in collaboration with an international panel of inquiry (headed by Professor Douglass Cassel, formerly of Northwestern University School of Law) has implicated this gang in 87 killings which were carried out in the 1970s against Catholics and nationalists. The name, first used in 2003, is derived from a farm in Glenanne, County Armagh, which the UVF regularly used as an arms dump and bomb-making site. It was owned by James Mitchell, an RUC reservist. According to John Weir, the gang usually did not use the name UVF whenever it claimed its attacks; instead it employed the cover names of \\"Red Hand Commando\\", \\"Protestant Action Force\\", or \\"Red Hand Brigade\\". Weir named Jackson as a key player in the Glenanne gang.John Weir: \\"I'm lucky to be above the ground\\". Article in Politico.ie, by Frank Connolly, 16 November 2006; retrieved 14 February 2011 He had close ties to loyalist extremists from Dungannon such as brothers Wesley and John James Somerville, with whom he was often spotted drinking in the Morning Star pub in the town. Alleged shooting and bombing attacks Patrick Campbell shooting He was first arrested on 8 November 1973 for the killing on 28 October of Patrick Campbell, a Catholic trade unionist from Banbridge who was gunned down on his doorstep. Jackson's words after he was charged with the killing were: \\"Nothing. I just can't believe it\\". Campbell's wife, Margaret had opened the door to the gunman and his accomplice when they had come looking for her husband. She had got a good look at the two men, who drove off in a Ford Cortina after the shooting, and although she identified Jackson as the killer at an identity parade, murder charges against him were dropped on 4 January 1974 at Belfast Magistrates' Court. The charges were allegedly withdrawn because the RUC thought Mrs. Campbell knew him beforehand. Jackson confirmed this, saying that they had met previously on account that he worked in the same Banbridge shoe factory (Down Shoes Ltd.) as Patrick Campbell. It was suggested in David McKittrick's Lost Lives that some time before the shooting there may have been a \\"minor political disagreement\\" between Jackson and Campbell while the two men were on a night out. Raymond Murray, in his book The SAS in Ireland, suggested that his accomplice in the shooting was Wesley Somerville. Irish writer and journalist Hugh Jordan also maintains this allegation. When the RUC had searched Jackson's house after his arrest they discovered 49 additional bullets to those allotted a serving member of the UDR. A notebook was also found which contained personal details of over two dozen individuals including their car registration numbers.Cadwallader, Anne (2013). Lethal Allies: the charmed life of a sectarian killer retrieved 30 January 2016. Dublin car bombings RUC Special Patrol Group officer John Weir claimed to have first met Jackson in 1974 at Norman's Bar, in Moira, County Down. Weir stated in an affidavit that Jackson was one of those who had planned and carried out the Dublin car bombings. According to Weir, Jackson, along with the main organiser Billy Hanna and Davy Payne (UDA, Belfast), led one of the two UVF units that bombed Dublin on 17 May 1974 in three separate explosions, resulting in the deaths of 26 people, including two infant girls. Close to 300 others were injured in the blasts; many of them maimed and scarred for life.The three explosions which occurred in the city centre of Dublin on 17 May 1974 resulted in the deaths of 26 people; another seven people died in the Monaghan bomb, bringing the total of deaths to 33. Journalist Peter Taylor affirmed that the Dublin car bombings were carried out by two UVF units, one from Mid-Ulster, the other from Belfast. The bombings took place on the third day of the Ulster Workers Council Strike, which was a general strike in Northern Ireland called by hardline unionists in protest against the Sunningdale Agreement and the Northern Ireland Assembly which had proposed their sharing political power with nationalists in an Executive that also planned a greater role for the Republic of Ireland in the governance of Northern Ireland. In 2003, Weir's information was published in the Barron Report, which was the findings of an official investigation into the bombings by Irish Supreme Court Justice Henry Barron. Justice Barron concluded Weir's \\"evidence overall is credible\\". An article by Paul Foot in Private Eye also implicated Jackson in the bombings.\\"The Barron Report identified at least nine men who may have been involved in the bombing of Dublin and Monaghan in 1974. Three are known to be dead\\". Irish Times ‚Äì Newshound: daily Northern Ireland news catalog. 12 December 2003. Retrieved 6 April 2011. Paul Foot's 1993 article went on to add that Jackson \\"has continued murdering people ever since, to the profound indifference of the authorities\\". The producers of the 1993 Yorkshire Television documentary, The Hidden Hand: The Forgotten Massacre, referred to Jackson indirectly as one of the bombers. However, three of his alleged accomplices, Billy Hanna, Harris Boyle, and Robert McConnell were directly named.Houses of the Oireachtas, Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, Interim Report on the Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings (The Barron Report), December 2003, Appendices: The Hidden Hand: The Forgotten Massacre. p. 15 Retrieved 7 October 2011 Although the incriminating evidence against Jackson had comprised eight hours of recorded testimony which came from one of his purported chief accomplices in the bombings, the programme did not name him directly during the transmission as the station did not want to risk an accusation of libel. The programme's narrator instead referred to him as \\"the Jackal\\". Hanna, Boyle, and McConnell were deceased at the time of the programme's airing. According to submissions received by Mr. Justice Barron, on the morning of 17 May 1974, the day of the bombings, Jackson collected the three bombs and placed them onto his poultry lorry at James Mitchell's farm in Glenanne, County Armagh, which had been used for the construction and storage of the devices.\\"Sunningdale pushed hardliners into fatal outrages in 1974\\". Irish Independent. Joe Tiernan. 16 May 1999 \\"The bombs, which were earlier stored at the home of a Protestant farmer near Markethill in Co. Armagh, were transported across the border to Whitehall by Robin Jackson in a chicken lorry. Jackson drove a chicken lorry around Ireland for a living for a number of years in the 1970s\\". He then drove across the border to Dublin, crossing the Boyne River at Oldbridge. The route had been well-rehearsed over the previous months. Billy Hanna, then the Mid-Ulster UVF's commander and the principal organiser of the attacks, accompanied him. At the Coachman's Inn pub carpark on the Swords Road near Dublin Airport, the two men met up with the other members of the UVF bombing team. Jackson and Hanna subsequently transferred the bombs from his lorry into the boots of three allocated cars, which had been hijacked and stolen that morning in Belfast. The Hidden Hand producers named William \\"Frenchie\\" Marchant of the UVF's A Coy, 1st Battalion Belfast Brigade, as having been on a Garda list of suspects as the organiser of the hijackings in Belfast on the morning of the bombings. The cars, after being obtained by the gang of hijackers, known as \\"Freddie and the Dreamers\\", were driven from Belfast across the border to the carpark, retaining their original registration numbers. Journalist Joe Tiernan suggested that the bombs were activated by Billy Hanna. Sometime before 4.00 p.m., Jackson and Hanna headed back to Northern Ireland in the poultry lorry after the latter had given the final instructions to the drivers of the car bombs. Upon their return, Jackson and Hanna went back to the soup kitchen they were running at a Mourneville, Lurgan bingo hall. With the UWC strike in its third day, it was extremely difficult for people throughout Northern Ireland to obtain necessities such as food. Neither man's absence had been noticed by the other helpers. Following Hanna's orders, the three car bombs (two of them escorted by a \\"scout\\" [lead] car, to be used for the bombers' escape back across the Northern Ireland border) were driven into the city centre of Dublin where they detonated in Parnell Street, Talbot Street, and South Leinster Street, almost simultaneously at approximately 5.30 pm. No warnings were given. From the available forensic evidence derived from material traces at the scene, the bombs are believed to have contained, as their main tertiary explosive a gelignite containing ammonium nitrate, packed into the usual metallic beer barrel container used by loyalists in prior car bombings.Houses of the Oireachtas, Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, Interim Report on the Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings (The Barron Report), December 2003, Appendices: The Hidden Hand: The Forgotten Massacre, p.64-71 Retrieved 7 October 2011 Twenty-three people were killed outright in the blasts, including a pregnant woman and her unborn child; three more people would later die of their injuries.

Thirty minutes earlier in Monaghan, an additional seven people were killed instantly or fatally injured by a fourth car bomb which had been delivered by a team from the Mid-Ulster UVF's Portadown unit. According to Joe Tiernan, this attack was carried out to draw the Garda√≠ away from the border, enabling the Dublin bombers to cross back into Northern Ireland undetected. Jackson was questioned following the Yorkshire Television programme, and he denied any involvement in the Dublin attacks. His name had appeared on a Garda list of suspects for the bombings. Hanna's name was on both the Garda and the RUC's list of suspects; however, neither of the two men were ever arrested or interrogated in connection with the bombings. The submissions made to the Barron Inquiry also stated that one week before the Dublin attacks, Jackson and others had been stopped at a Garda checkpoint at Hackballs Cross. Nobody was ever convicted of the car bombings. Years later, British journalist Peter Taylor in an interview with Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) politician and former senior Belfast UVF member David Ervine questioned him about UVF motives for the 1974 Dublin attacks. Ervine replied they [UVF] were \\"returning the serve\\". Ervine, although he had not participated in the bombings, explained that the UVF had wanted the Catholics across the border in the Republic of Ireland to suffer as Protestants in Northern Ireland had suffered on account of the intensive bombing campaign waged by the Provisional IRA. On 28 May 1974, 11 days after the bombings, the UWC strike ended with the collapse of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the power-sharing Executive. John Francis Green killing Statements made by John Weir affirmed Jackson's active participation in the killing of senior IRA member John Francis Green in Mullyash, near Castleblayney, County Monaghan. On the evening of 10 January 1975, gunmen kicked down the front door of the \\"safe\\" house Green was staying in and, finding him alone in the living room, immediately opened fire, shooting him six times in the head at close range. The bullets all entered from the front, which indicated that Green had been facing his killers.Houses of the Oireachtas, Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women‚Äôs Rights, Interim Report on the Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings (The Barron Report), December 2003, Appendices (pp. 4-20): The murder of John Francis Green, cain.ulst.ac.uk; accessed 17 July 2014.

Hanna and his wife Ann had just returned from a function at the local British Legion Club. When he stepped out of the car, Jackson and another man approached him. After asking them \\"What are you playing at?\\" Jackson produced a pistol, walked over and shot him twice in the head; once in the temple and afterwards in the back of the head, execution style as he lay on the ground. His wife witnessed the killing. Joe Tiernan suggested that Jackson killed Hanna on account of the latter's refusal to participate in the Miami Showband killings. Hanna apparently suffered remorse following the 1974 Dublin bombings, as he is believed by Tiernan to have instructed one of the bombers, David Alexander Mulholland to drive the car which exploded in Parnell Street, where two infant girls were among those killed. According to Tiernan and the Barron Report, Mulholland was identified by three eyewitnesses. Tiernan also suggested that Hanna and Mulholland became informers for the Garda√≠ regarding the car bombings in exchange for immunity from prosecution. He added that although the British Army was aware of this, Jackson was never told, as it was feared he would decide to become an informer himself. Investigative journalist Paul Larkin, in his book A Very British Jihad: collusion, conspiracy, and cover-up in Northern Ireland maintained that Jackson, accompanied by Harris Boyle, had shot Hanna after learning that he had passed on information regarding the Dublin bombings.Larkin, p.182 Martin Dillon also claims this in The Trigger Men.Dillon, Martin (2003). \\"The Trigger Men\\". Edinburgh: Mainstream Publishing. p.25 Dillon also stated in The Dirty War that because a number of UDR/UVF men were to be used for the planned Miami Showband attack, the UVF considered Hanna to have been a \\"security risk\\", and therefore it had been necessary to kill him. David McKittrick in Lost Lives, however, suggested that Jackson had actually killed Hanna in order to obtain a cache of weapons the latter held. The UVF drew its greatest strength as well as the organisation's most ruthless members from its Mid-Ulster Brigade according to Irish journalist Brendan O'Brien. Miami Showband massacre Site of the Miami Showband killings which occurred on 31 July 1975. Jackson was implicated in this attack which left three band members and two UVF men dead Jackson was also alleged by Kevin Dowling, Joe Tiernan, and the Pat Finucane Centre to have led the UVF gang that carried out the Miami Showband ambush and massacre at Buskhill, outside Newry on 31 July 1975, which left band members Brian McCoy, Fran O'Toole and Tony Geraghty dead. Two others, Stephen Travers and Des McAlea, were wounded. Journalist Hugh Jordan also confirmed Jackson's presence at the Miami Showband ambush. Harris Boyle and Wesley Somerville, both suspects in the Dublin bombings, and members of both the UDR and Mid- Ulster UVF, were accidentally blown up as they placed a bomb under the driver's seat of the band's minibus which had been parked in a lay-by. The minibus, driven by trumpeter Brian McCoy (a Protestant from Caledon, County Tyrone), had been flagged-down by UVF men wearing British Army uniforms at a bogus roadside military checkpoint on the main A1 road as the band was returning home to Dublin after a performance in Banbridge. Following the premature detonation, which ripped the vehicle in half, the band members were then gunned down by the surviving UVF men. Loyalist paramilitarism researcher Jeanne Griffin suggested that Jackson had planned the ambush as a means to eliminate Brian McCoy who had strong family connections to the Orange Order and the security forces. According to Griffin's theory, Jackson had on an earlier date, approached McCoy with a proposal to secure his help in carrying out UVF attacks in the Irish Republic. When McCoy refused, Jackson saw this as a betrayal of the loyalist cause so devised the plan to ambush McCoy and his bandmates in retaliation. She also suggests that it was Jackson who shot McCoy dead in the first volley of gunfire and it was the gunman surviving bassist Stephen Travers heard kicking McCoy's dead body afterwards as well as firing another round into him. She based her theories on the nine bullets that had been fired from a Luger into McCoy and that Jackson's fingerprints were found on the silencer that was used for a Luger. Jackson had assumed command of the Mid-Ulster UVF just a few days before the attack, when he allegedly shot commander Billy Hanna to death on 27 July. As previously stated, Harris Boyle had reportedly accompanied Jackson to the shooting.Dillon, Martin (2003). The Trigger Men. UK: Mainstream. p.25 Jackson had afterwards attended Hanna's funeral, where he was photographed standing beside Wesley Somerville. On 5 August 1975, Jackson was taken in and questioned by the RUC as a suspect in the Miami Showband killings; he was subsequently released two days later without facing any charges. In October 1976, two serving members of the UDR (Thomas Crozier and James McDowell) received life sentences for the killings. A third man, former UDR soldier, John James Somerville was sentenced to life imprisonment in November 1981. After his arrest, Jackson accused two CID Detective Constables, Norman Carlisle and Raymond Buchanan, of having physically assaulted him on 7 August 1975 while he had been in police custody at Bessbrook RUC Station. Although medical evidence presented at the trial of the accused Detective Constables raised the possibility that Jackson's injuries were self-inflicted, on 23 December 1975 a magistrate upheld the charge against the two CID men and they were fined ¬£10 each. On 11 June 1975, more than a month prior to the Miami Showband killings, Jackson, his brother- in-law, Samuel Fulton Neill, and Thomas Crozier had been arrested for the possession of four shotguns. Neill's car was later used in the Showband ambush. Neill was fatally shot in Portadown on 25 January 1976 allegedly by Jackson for having passed on information to the RUC about the people involved in the Showband attack. The Douglass Cassel panel of inquiry stated that it was unclear why Jackson, Crozier, and Neill had not been in police custody at the time the Showband killings took place. The panel concluded that there was \\"credible evidence that the principal perpetrator [of the Miami Showband attack] was a man who was not prosecuted ‚Äì alleged RUC Special Branch agent Robin Jackson\\". Former British soldier and psychological warfare operative Major Colin Wallace stated that he was told in 1974 that Jackson was working as an agent for the RUC's Special Branch. He confirmed this allegation in a letter written to a colleague dated 14 August 1975 in which he named Jackson as an RUC Special Branch agent. The Historical Enquiries Team (HET), which was set up by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) to investigate some of the more controversial Troubles-related deaths, released their report on the Miami Showband killings to the victims' families in December 2011. The findings noted in this report confirmed that Jackson was linked to the killings. It also stated that during police interrogations, Jackson had claimed that after the shootings a senior RUC officer had advised him to \\"lie low\\". Although this information was passed on to RUC headquarters and its Complaints and Discipline Department, nothing was done about it. The HET Report identified Jackson as having been an RUC Special Branch agent.\\"Miami Showband massacre: HET raises collusion concerns\\". BBC News. 14 December 2011 Links to Captain Robert Nairac It was stated by The Hidden Hand programme that Jackson had links to British Military Intelligence and Liaison officer Captain Robert Nairac. The Hidden Hand alleged that Jackson and his UVF comrades were controlled by Nairac who was attached to 14th Intelligence Company (The Det). Former MI6 operative, Captain Fred Holroyd claimed that Nairac admitted to having been involved in John Francis Green's death and had shown Holroyd a colour polaroid photograph of Green's corpse to back up his claim. Holroyd believed that for some months leading up to his shooting, Green had been kept under surveillance by 4 Field Survey Troop, Royal Engineers, one of the three sub-units of 14th Intelligence. This unit was based in Castledillon, County Armagh, and according to Holroyd, was the cover name of an SAS troop commanded by Nairac and Captain Julian Antony \\"Tony\\" Ball. Nairac was himself abducted and killed by the IRA in 1977, and Ball was killed in an accident in Oman in 1981.\\"Nairac: An undercover hero or a maverick fool?\\", Belfast Telegraph. 13 May 2007; retrieved 13 December 2010. Justice Barron himself questioned Holroyd's evidence as a result of two later Garda investigations, where Detective Inspector Culhane discounted Holroyd's allegations regarding Nairac and the polaroid photograph. Culhane concluded that the latter had been one of a series of official photographs taken of Green's body the morning following his killing by Detective Sergeant William Stratford, who worked in the Garda Technical Bureau's Photography Section. Weir made the following statements in relation to Jackson and Nairac's alleged mutual involvement in the Green assassination: > The men who did that shooting were Robert McConnell, Robin Jackson, and I > would be almost certain, Harris Boyle who was killed in the Miami attack. > What I am absolutely certain of is that Robert McConnell, Robert McConnell > knew that area really, really well. Robin Jackson was with him. I was later > told that Nairac was with them. I was told by ... a UVF man, he was very > close to Jackson and operated with him. Jackson told [him] that Nairac was > with them. In his 1989 book War Without Honour, Holyroyd claimed that Nairac had organised the Miami Showband ambush in collaboration with Jackson, and had also been present at Buskhill when the attack was carried out. Bassist Stephen Travers and saxophonist Des McAlea, the two bandmembers who survived the shootings, both testified in court that a British Army officer \\"with a crisp, clipped English accent\\" had overseen the operation. However, when shown a photograph of Nairac, Travers could not positively identify him as the soldier who had been at the scene. Martin Dillon in The Dirty War adamantly stated that Nairac had not been involved in the Green killing nor in the Miami Showband massacre. The Barron Report noted that although Weir maintained that Jackson and Billy Hanna had links to Nairac and British Military Intelligence, his claim did not imply that the British Army or Military Intelligence had aided the two men in the planning and perpetration of the 1974 Dublin bombings. While in prison, Weir wrote a letter to a friend claiming that Nairac had ties to both Jackson and James Mitchell, owner of the Glenanne farm. The 2006 Interim Report of Mr. Justice Barron's inquiry into the Dundalk bombing of 1975 (see below) concluded that Jackson was one of the suspected bombers \\"reliably said to have had relationships with British Intelligence and or RUC Special Branch officers\\".\\"Barron Links Glenanne Gang to 1975 Dundalk Bombing\\". The Green Ribbon. Tom Griffin. 15 July 2006 Retrieved 3 February 2011 In 2015, a biography of Nairac entitled \\"Betrayal: the Murder of Robert Nairac\\" was published. Written by former diplomat Alistair Kerr, the book provides documentary evidence that shows Nairac as having been elsewhere at the time of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, John Francis Green killing and Miami Showband ambush took place. On 17 May 1974 he was on a months-long training course in England; 10 January 1975 there were three witnesses who placed him on temporary duty in Derry for a secret mission; and on 31 July 1975 at 4am he had started on a road journey from London to Scotland for a fishing holiday. Other killings 1975 The 2006 Interim Report named Jackson as having possibly been one of the two gunmen in the shooting death of the McKearney couple on 23 October 1975. Peter McKearney was shot between 14 and 18 times, and his wife, Jenny 11 times. The shooting took place at their home in Moy, County Tyrone; Jackson was linked to the Sterling submachine gun used in the killings. \\"Glenanne gang\\" member Garnet Busby pleaded guilty to the killings and was sentenced to life imprisonment. John Weir claimed that Jackson led the group who bombed Kay's Tavern pub in Dundalk on 19 December 1975, which killed two men. Barron implicated the \\"Glenanne gang\\" in the bombing, however, Jackson was not identified by any eyewitnesses at or in the vicinity of Kay's Tavern. Garda√≠ received information from a reliable source that Jackson and his car ‚Äì a Vauxhall Viva with the registration number CIA 2771 ‚Äì were involved in the bombing; yet there were no witnesses who reported having seen the car. The RUC stated that Jackson had been observed celebrating at a Banbridge bar at 9.00 pm on the evening of the attack in the company of other loyalist extremists. The implication was that they were celebrating the Kay's Tavern bombing. 1976 The following month, on 4 January 1976, Jackson supposedly organised the \\"Glenanne gang\\"'s two co-ordinated sectarian attacks against the O'Dowd and Reavey families in County Armagh, leaving a total of five men dead and one injured. Weir maintained that it was Jackson who shot 61-year-old Joseph O'Dowd and his two nephews, Barry and Declan, to death at a family celebration in Ballydougan, near Gilford; although Jackson had not been at the scene where the Reavey brothers had been killed twenty minutes earlier. The day after the double killing, ten Protestant workmen were gunned down by the South Armagh Republican Action Force, who ambushed their minibus near the village of Kingsmill. The shootings were in retaliation for the O'Dowd and Reavey killings. The Glenanne gang made plans to avenge the Kingsmill victims with an attack on St Lawrence O'Toole Primary School, Belleeks. This plan, which involved the killing of at least 30 schoolchildren and their teacher, was called off at the last minute by the UVF's Brigade Staff (Belfast leadership based on the Shankill Road), who considered it \\"morally unacceptable\\" and feared it would have led to a civil war.\\"UVF Planned to Kill 30 Children\\". The Irish News by Barry McCaffrey and Seamus McKinney. 9 July 2007 Retrieved 26 February 2011 Based on the description given by Barney O'Dowd, a survivor of the shooting attack at Ballydougan, one of the weapons used in the O'Dowd killings was a Luger with an attached silencer. The findings noted in the HET Report on the Miami Showband killings revealed that on 19 May 1976, two fingerprints belonging to Jackson were discovered on the metal barrel of a home-made silencer constructed for a Luger pistol. Both the silencer and Luger, as well as more firearms, ammunition, a magazine, explosives, and bomb-making material, were found by the security forces at the farm of a man by the name of Edward Sinclair, a former member of the \\"B Specials\\". The exhibit, however, was mistakenly labelled indicating that his prints had been found on the black insulating tape wrapped around the silencer rather than the silencer itself.\\"Miami Showband massacre: Involvement of UVF Man Robin Jackson\\". Pat Finucane Centre. 14 December 2011; retrieved 15 December 2011. After several unsuccessful attempts to apprehend Jackson between 20 and 30 May, Jackson was arrested at his home on 31 May under Section 10 of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973; he was taken to Armagh Police Station.\\"Issues relating to Robert 'Robin' Jackson\\". Pat Finucane Centre. p.73 Retrieved 17 December 2011 This was when the amended information regarding his fingerprints was delivered to Detective Superintendent Ernest Drew at Armagh. Drew and Detective Constable William Elder both questioned him; Jackson denied ever having been at Sinclair's farm whilst admitting knowing him through the Portadown Loyalist Club which they both frequented. When shown the Luger, silencer and magazine (but not the insulating tape), Jackson denied having handled them. When asked by Detective Superintendent Drew to provide an explanation should his fingerprints be discovered on either pistol or silencer, Jackson told him that one night at the Portadown Loyalist Club, Sinclair had asked him for some adhesive tape and Jackson claimed, \\"I gave him part of the roll I was using in the bar\\". Jackson had allegedly been using the tape whilst lapping hoses for beer kegs at the bar. In his statement to Detective Superintendent Drew, Jackson claimed that one week prior to his arrest, two high-ranking RUC officers had tipped him off about his fingerprints having been found on the insulating tape wrapped around the silencer used with the Luger. Jackson went on to say that he was forewarned, using the words: \\"I should clear as there was a wee job up the country that I would be done for and there was no way out of it for me\\". On 2 June, Jackson was charged with possession of a firearm, a magazine, four rounds of ammunition and a silencer with intent to endanger life. He was detained in custody and went to trial on 11 November 1976 at a Diplock Court held at Belfast City Commission, charged only with possession of the silencer. Although the judge initially rejected his defence that his fingerprints were on the insulating tape and had \\"been innocently transferred to the silencer\\", he managed to avoid conviction when he was acquitted of the charge. The trial judge, Mr Justice Murray, had said: \\"At the end of the day I find that the accused somehow touched the silencer, but the Crown evidence has left me completely in the dark as to whether he did that wittingly or unwittingly, willingly or unwillingly\\". As a result of the judicious examination of forensic ballistics procured from original RUC reports and presented to Justice Barron, the 9 mm Luger pistol, serial no. U 4 for which the silencer was specifically made, was established as having been the same one used in the Miami Showband and John Francis Green killings. According to journalist Tom McGurk, Miami Showband trumpeter Brian McCoy was shot nine times in the back with a Luger pistol.\\"The mystery of the Miami murders\\" by Tom McGurk . Sunday Business Post, thePost.ie. 31 July 2005; retrieved 15 December 2010. The Miami inquiry team was never informed of these developments and Jackson was never questioned about the Miami Showband killings following the discovery of his fingerprints on the silencer. The Luger pistol serial no. U 4 was later destroyed by the RUC on 28 August 1978. Barney O'Dowd claimed RUC detectives in the 1980s admitted to him that Jackson had been the man who shot the three O'Dowd men, but the evidence had not been sufficient to charge him with the killings. In 2006, Barney O'Dowd spoke at the public hearings of the Houses of the Oireachtas Sub-Committee on the Barron Report Debate. He maintained that in June 1976 an RUC detective came to see him at his home and told him the gunman could not be charged with the killings as he was the \\"head of the UVF\\" and a \\"hard man\\" who could not be broken during police interrogation. Additionally the UVF had threatened to start shooting policeman like the IRA were doing if the gunman was ever charged with murder.Sub-Committee on the Barron Report ‚Äì 26 September 2006 Public Hearings on the Barron Report, Houses of the Oireachtas, Tuesday, 26 September 2006, p. 3; retrieved 6 April 2012. Weir stated in his affidavit that on one occasion some months after he was transferred to Newry RUC station in October 1976, Jackson himself, and another RUC officer and \\"Glenanne gang\\" member, Gary Armstrong, went on a reconnaissance in south Armagh seeking out the homes of known IRA members, with the aim of assassinating them. Jackson, according to Weir, carried a knife and hammer, and boasted to Weir that if they happened to \\"find a suitable person to kill\\", he [Jackson] \\"knew how to do it with those weapons\\".\\"Seeing Red\\", John Weir , John Weir statement , 3 January 1999; retrieved 13 December 2010.This incident had to have taken place after 11 November 1976, as Jackson was in custody from 31 May to the time of his trial, which was held on 11 November. They approached the houses of two IRA men; however, the plan to attack them was aborted and they drove back to Lurgan. They were stopped at an RUC roadblock near the Republic of Ireland border, but the three men were waved through, after an exchange of courtesies, despite the presence of Jackson in the car with two RUC officers. 1977 and the William Strathearn killing The village of Ahoghill, County Antrim, where the William Strathearn killing took place He was implicated by Weir in the killing of Catholic chemist, William Strathearn, who was shot at his home in Ahoghill, County Antrim after two men knocked on his door at 2.00 am on 19 April 1977 claiming to need medicine for a sick child. Strathearn lived above his chemist's shop. Weir was one of the RUC men later convicted of the killing, along with his SPG colleague, Billy McCaughey, and he named Jackson as having been the gunman, alleging that Jackson had told him after the shooting that he had shot Strathearn twice when the latter opened the door. Weir and McCaughey had waited in Weir's car while the shooting was carried out. The gun that Jackson used had been given to him by McCaughey, with the instructions that he was only to fire through an upstairs window to frighten the occupants and make sure they \\"got the message\\", and not to kill anyone. As in the Dublin bombings, Jackson's poultry lorry was also employed on this occasion, specifically to transport himself and Robert John \\"R.J.\\" Kerr, another alleged accomplice, to and from the scene of the crime. After the killing, Jackson and Kerr went on to deliver a load of chickens. Kerr was allegedly Jackson's lorry helper, assisting in loading and unloading chickens which Jackson sold for a living. Jackson was never questioned about the killing. According to an RUC detective, he was not interrogated for \\"reasons of operational strategy\\". Weir suggested that \\"Jackson was untouchable because he was an RUC Special Branch agent.\\" The Barron Report stated that Weir had made an offer to testify against Jackson and Robert John \\"R.J\\". Kerr, but only on the condition that the murder charge against him was withdrawn. This offer was refused by the Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions who said > Kerr and Jackson have not been interviewed by the police because the police > state they are virtually immune to interrogation and the common police > consensus is that to arrest and interview either man is a waste of time. > Both men are known to police to be very active and notorious UVF murderers. > Nevertheless the police do not recommend consideration of withdrawal of > charges against Weir.

It is noted in the Barron Report that Northern Ireland's Lord Chief Justice Robert Lowry was aware of Jackson and Kerr's involvement in the Strathearn killing, and that they were not prosecuted for \\"operational reasons\\".Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence, and Women's Rights Sub-Committee on the Barron Report 18 February 2004, p. 2; retrieved 8 January 2011. Mr. Justice Barron was highly critical of the RUC's failure to properly investigate Jackson. Weir declared \\"I think it is important to make it clear that this collusion between loyalist paramilitaries such as Robin Jackson and my RUC colleagues and me was taking place with the full knowledge of my superiors\\". 1978‚Äì1991 The interior of Crumlin Road Prison in Belfast. Following his arrest in 1979 for possession of guns, ammunition, and hoods, Jackson was remanded in custody to the prison to await trial Journalist Liam Clarke alleged that in early 1978, Weir and Jackson traveled to Castleblaney with the intention of kidnapping an IRA volunteer named Dessie O'Hare from a pub called The Spinning Wheel. However, when Jackson and Weir arrived, they discovered the publican had been warned of the kidnap plot and they were ordered to leave the premises.\\"RUC men's secret war against the IRA\\" by Liam Clarke, Sunday Times, 7 March 1999. Jackson's sole conviction came after he was arrested on 16 October 1979 when a .22 pistol, a .38 revolver, a magazine, 13 rounds of ammunition, and hoods were found in his possession. He was remanded in custody to Crumlin Road Prison in Belfast to await trial. On 20 January 1981, Jackson was brought before the Belfast Crown Court on charges of possession of guns and ammunition, and was sentenced to seven years in prison. He was released on 12 May 1983. A man whose description matched Jackson's was seen behaving suspiciously in the vicinity of Lurgan RUC barracks close to where three prominent republicans were later ambushed and shot by masked UVF gunmen after they left the police station on 7 March 1990. The republicans had been signing in at the station as part of their bail conditions for charges of possession of ammunition. Sam Marshall was killed in the attack; Colin Duffy and Tony McCaughey were both wounded. Although the shooting was claimed by the UVF, the gunmen were never caught. Two UVF members were later convicted of having supplied the car used in the ambush.\\"Push for inquest over UVF murder of Sam Marshall after HET report\\", Belfast Telegraph. 6 March 2012; retrieved 4 May 2012. He reportedly perpetrated his last killings in March 1991, with the fatal shootings of three Catholics, Eileen Duffy, Catriona Rennie, and Brian Frizzell, at a mobile shop in Craigavon. Duffy and Rennie were teenage girls. Weir's affidavit contradicted this as it pointed out that although Jackson was aware that the killings were to take place, he had not been at the scene of the crime; a solicitor informed Weir he had been with Jackson at his home at the time the shootings occurred to provide him with an alibi. Investigative journalist Paul Larkin suggested that the shooting attack against the shop was organised by Jackson upon receiving complaints from UDR soldiers after they had been refused service and insulted by the mobile shop employees. Larkin identified one of the hitmen as Mark \\"Swinger\\" Fulton. Although the RUC initially arrested UVF members associated with Jackson, they then focused their attention on the men belonging to the Mid-Ulster Brigade's Portadown unit led by Billy Wright. Fulton was a prominent member of this unit and served as Wright's right-hand man.Larkin, Paul (2004). A Very British Jihad: collusion, conspiracy and cover-up in Northern Ireland.

Kevin Dowling in the Irish Independent, dubbed Jackson the \\"Lord High Executioner of the North's notorious murder triangle\\", adding that he was infamous from Belfast to the Irish border for \\"the intensity and fury of his instinct to kill\\".

Gerry Moriarty. 25 October 2013 retrieved 19 May 2016 Unnamed Intelligence officers personally acquainted with Jackson stated that he was a psychopath who would often dress up and attend the funerals of his victims because he felt a need \\"to make sure they were dead.\\" Described as a sardonic man who was extremely dedicated; physically he was dark-haired, blue-eyed, \\"small, but firmly-built\\". Suspicious by nature, he repeatedly advised his associates that they should never reveal secret information to anyone. His paranoia and fear of recognition by his potential victims was such that he attempted to destroy all photographs of himself including school and family pictures. Psychological warfare operative Major Colin Wallace corroborated the allegations, stating that > [E]verything people had whispered about Robin Jackson for years was > perfectly true. He was a hired gun. A professional assassin. He was > responsible for more deaths in the North [Northern Ireland] than any other > person I knew. The Jackal killed people for a living. The State not only > knew that he was doing it. Its servants encouraged him to kill its political > opponents and protected him. Wallace also named Jackson as having been \\"centrally-involved\\" in the Dublin bombings, but like Weir, suggested that the principal organiser had been Billy Hanna. Wallace's psychological operations unit typically targeted loyalist extremists; however, during the period of 1973 and 1974 he was refused clearance to target principal members of the Mid-Ulster UVF despite an increase in paramilitary activity from the organisation. In June 1974, a month after the bombings, Wallace was denied permission to target key loyalists including Jackson and Hanna, as their names were on a list which excluded them from being targeted for psychological operations. This appeared to indicate that in practice, those members of paramilitaries whose names were listed were also excluded from being targeted for prosecution. Liam Clarke of the Sunday Times made the following statements regarding Jackson and his reported special relationship with the security forces and military intelligence: > Jackson had many allies still serving in the UDR and close links to special > forces soldiers.

The Sunday Times by Liam Clarke. 7 March 1999. Originally nicknamed \\"Jacko\\", Jackson was given the more sinister sobriquet, \\"the Jackal\\" by Sunday World newspaper's Northern Ireland editor Jim Campbell when he investigated and exposed Jackson's alleged paramilitary activities ‚Äì including his involvement in the Miami Showband killings ‚Äì and links to British Military Intelligence. In retaliation, Jackson reportedly approached members of the violent loyalist Shankill Butchers gang in Belfast, who (at Jackson's request) shot and seriously wounded Campbell on 18 May 1984.\\"Fearless Sunday World reporter writes his last column\\".

According to journalist Joe Gorrod of The Mirror, it was reported in the Irish Times that the SAS took Jackson abroad where he received specialist training. In the late 1980s, he was also sent by MI5 to South Africa and Australia to buy weapons that were shipped back to loyalist paramilitaries and Ulster ResistanceUlster Resistance was a paramilitary movement founded on 10 November 1986 by unionists opposed to the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement. in Northern Ireland. Gorrod wrote that Jackson kept hidden files that incriminated the politicians and businessmen who were involved with Jackson in the loyalist arms shipments. In his book Loyalists, British journalist Peter Taylor devotes pages 187‚Äì195 to the loyalists' South African arms deals which had taken place in the late 1980s. Jackson's name does not appear in the account nor is Australia referred to. Joe Gorrod is the only journalist to make these allegations although Henry McDonald (of The Guardian) affirmed that Jackson lived for a period of time in South Africa during the 1980s.\\"Miami Showband killings: police tipoff helped suspect elude justice, says report\\", by Henry McDonald, The Guardian. 15 December 2011; retrieved 23 April 2013. The purported files, which were kept with a friend, would have ensured Jackson that he would never be sentenced to a lengthy imprisonment. Weapons used in the 1994 UVF shooting attack on patrons in the Heights Bar at Loughinisland were later found to have come from the South African arms shipment that had ended up in the hands of Robin Jackson.Jackson linked to massacre\\". Banberidge Leader. 10 June 2016 Retrieved 5 November 2016 Succeeded by Billy Wright In the early 1990s, he handed over command of the Mid-Ulster UVF to Portadown unit leader Billy Wright, also known as \\"King Rat\\". Wright formed the breakaway Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) in 1996. This was after he and his Portadown unit had been stood down by the UVF's Brigade Staff in Belfast on 2 August 1996, following the unauthorised killing of a Catholic taxi driver by members of Wright's group outside Lurgan during the Drumcree disturbances when the UVF were on ceasefire. Although Wright took the officially-disbanded Portadown unit with him to form the LVF, Jackson, despite being on friendly terms with Wright, remained loyal to the UVF leadership as did most of the other Mid-Ulster Brigade units. Wright was shot dead inside the Maze Prison on 27 December 1997 by Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) inmates while waiting in a prison van which was transporting him to a visit with his girlfriend. Wright had been sentenced to eight years imprisonment for having threatened a woman's life. Jackson was confronted in 1998 by the son of RUC Sergeant Joseph Campbell, a Catholic Sergeant gunned down outside the Cushendall, County Antrim RUC station in February 1977, as he was locking up. It was rumoured that Jackson had been the hitman sent to shoot Campbell on behalf of an RUC Special Branch officer. Weir, in his affidavit, claimed Jackson, prior to Campbell's shooting, had informed him of the RUC officer's request.\\"Search For the Truth in a Trail of Murder\\"; retrieved 14 February 2011. Jackson, by then dying of cancer, told Campbell's son that he had not been involved in the killing. The UVF, at a secret meeting with journalists, declared that Jackson had no part in Campbell's killing. The case was later placed under investigation by the Office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.\\"Widow's Appeal Over RUC Killing\\", BBC News; retrieved 14 February 2011. Death Jackson died of lung cancer at his Donaghcloney home on Saturday, 30 May 1998. and was buried the following Monday, 1 June in a private ceremony in the St. Bartholomew Church of Ireland churchyard in his native Donaghmore, County Down. His grave, close to that of his parents, is unmarked apart from a steel poppy cross. He was 49 years old. His father had died in 1985 and his mother outlived him for five years. After his death, a friend of Jackson told Gorrod that Jackson had no regrets about his UVF activities; however, due to his religious upbringing he was tormented by feelings of remorse on his deathbed believing that he had been \\"drawn into a world of evil that wasn't of his making\\". One of his last wishes was that the secret documents incriminating the politicians and businessmen with whom he associated be released to the public. Liam Clarke suggested the killing of Billy Hanna was the only killing Jackson ever regretted, admitting it had been \\"unfair\\" to kill him. Journalist Martin O'Hagan had been in the process of writing a book about Jackson but his assassination by the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) in 2001 prevented its completion. Along with Billy Hanna and other senior loyalists, Jackson was commemorated in the UVF song Battalion of the Dead. In May 2010, angry relatives of UVF victims unsuccessfully sought the removal of the song from YouTube.

Plot The book begins with a dive into the journey of an Aboriginal tribe which, in 70,000 BCE, crosses the straits of Sunda toward what will become Australia. It is a chaotic and cadaver-ridden course and a fight against climatic evolution. Through centuries, the odyssey reveals a challenging cohabitation with other species and soon a violent confrontation with white Caucasian newcomers. In an additional contemporary plot, Liz, a young Australian woman, moves to France in search of her lost origins. But behind its postcard appearance, the small Provence village where her mother had lived is not what it seems to be. Somebody tries to drown Liz into the pond near her new house, just before the young woman finds a dead body in this pond. Liz is still far from knowing what or who she will have to fight, what or who has followed her from Sydney, from a past that she did not even suspect.

The metre gauge line is long. The railway is renowned for its historical steam locomotives in Mallet articulated locomotive style, as well as a collection of historic rolling stock and diesel railcars. The line runs between Tournon, in the Rh√¥ne Valley, and Lamastre in the Doux valley. From Lamastre, the original line ran a further to Le Cheylard. Originally opened on 12 July 1891, the line closed on 31 October 1968, and reopened as a heritage line the following year. In 2008, heritage services were suspended due to lack of funds to repair steam locomotives, among other issues. In 2013, steam returned to the Vivarais and services were resumed. History A network of lines was constructed around Vivarais between 1898 and 1903. The network comprised: * Lavo√ªte-sur-Loire - Yssingeaux - Raucoules- Brossettes (length ) * La Voulte-sur-Rh√¥ne - Le Cheylard (length ) * Tournon - Lamastre - Le Cheylard (length ) * Duni√®res -- Raucoules-Brossettes - Saint- Agr√®ve - Le Cheylard (length ) When the Vivarais network closed in 1968, a group of enthusiasts decided to save part of the network and rolling stock. On 14 June 1969 a tourist operation started between Saint-Jean-de-Muzols and Lamastre. The Meyzieu Tourist Railway Company (CFTM) was created to operate the line, supported by the Association de soutien au Cheman de fer du Vivarais (SGVA), a group of volunteers who restore and maintain the rolling stock. It was not until February 1970 that access was restored to the railway station at Tournon, and the new Tournon - Lamastre line, long, was officially opened on 18 April 1970. In 1973 the company was forced to buy the rolling stock, track and stations, which made the CFTM one of the few French operators of tourist railways to own the infrastructure and rolling stock. After operating without assistance for 35 years, the CFV searched for a partner. The department of Ard√®che became majority shareholder of the CFV in 2004, when the realisation of the Joint Economic Society (SEM) to be substitutes resulted CFTM with the department's commitment to make a contribution of funds corresponding to the proportion of assets of CFTM. These flows of funds would be materialised in the form of investments on track and rolling stock. However, these investments remained largely made on the equity of the company, thus creating an operating deficit. Although 7 km of track had been rebuilt, the steam locomotives - very expensive to maintain - were all in a state of disrepair at the beginning of the 2008 season. On 10 April 2008, the General Council of the Ard√®che (the railway's majority shareholder) took the decision to suspend traffic for the remainder of the season. Separately from this, another part of the original network, the section of the Duni√®res to Le Cheylard line between Duni√®res and Saint-Agr√®ve, is currently operated by the Association des Voies Ferr√©es du Velay under the name :fr:Velay Express.http://velay-express.net/ Re-opening efforts 2011 saw the introduction of a V√©lorail service, using small cars on rails which are operated by the passenger like bicycles, but steam traction remained absent while the association continued to formulate an operating plan for the future of the railway. In May 2012, the railway received a number of grants allowing work to commence in preparation for a steam service to return in the near future. As the railway was no longer permitted to operate on the dual-gauge section into Tournon, a new terminus station was constructed at Saint-Jean-de-Muzols, roughly 1.5 miles north of the historical terminus at Tournon. For the first time in five years, a fire was lit in a steam locomotive in June 2013, when Mallet 030-030 no.403 (constructed in 1903, granted Monument Historique (MH) status in 1987) returned to steam after a brisk five-month overhaul at Lamastre. On 2 July 2013, the first passengers travelled behind no.403 as services resumed between Tournon Saint-Jean and Boucieu-le-Roi, a journey of around 16 km or 10 miles.http://rhone- alpes.france3.fr/2013/07/02/ardeche-le-mastrou-de-nouveau-sur-les- rails-281091.html This service operates daily throughout July and August (except Mondays), and weekends in September and October. Additionally, on Tuesdays during September and October, steam services will operate the full length of the line between Tournon Saint-Jean and the northern terminus of Lamastre, a journey of some 30 km. A second steam locomotive, Mallet 030-030 no.414 (constructed 1932), is currently being overhauled and is intended to join no.403 in service in the near future.  Shared formation with the SNCF  Until the suspension of services in 2008, trains departed from the SNCF railway station at Tournon. Between here and Saint-Jean-de-Muzols, Vivarais trains operated along a dual gauge section of track shared with SNCF services for a length of . This section includes two tunnels and a viaduct. This line was opened by the PLM in the summer of 1879. As of 2013, this section of line is bypassed by Vivarais trains, which now begin at the new Saint-Jean-de- Muzols terminus.

Location  The Heinrichsh√∂he lies in the Harz National Park about 3.2 kilometres north-northwest of the village of Schierke in the southwestern part of the borough of Wernigerode. The summit rises about 1.4 kilometres southeast of the top of the Brocken and at least 205 metres northeast of near the Brocken Road (Brockenstra√üe or Brockenchaussee, K 1356) between Eckernlochstieg and Urwaldstieg. Near the summit on its southern flank is the tor of Brockentor (\\"Brocken Gate\\", 1,039.5 m).Heinrichsh√∂he (Gipfel) at www.geofinder.ch. Accessed on 9 Dec 2010.  History  The mountain was named after Count Henry Ernest (Heinrich Ernst) of Stolberg-Wernigerode, who had a peatworks established on the Heinrichsh√∂he in 1747. The buildings of the peatworks, including visitors‚Äô accommodation, burnt down in 1799. The Heinrichsh√∂he Way () is the oldest documented track to the Brocken. It was first mentioned in the records in 1591 and ran roughly parallel to the present day Brocken Road. From the top of the Heinrichsh√∂he it runs straight to the summit of the Brocken. In the First World War a Ski monument (Skidenkmal) was built alongside the track, not far from the Brockenteich. It is number 19 in the Harzer Wandernadel hiking system. At the highest point of the mountain there is a roughly 5 m high granite tor. In 1936 an inscription was carved in the rock by the Brockenschutz (\\"Brocken Guard\\"). The name Brockentor stems from the 18th century when the first Brocken inn was built immediately next to the tor. The Heinrichsh√∂he was a popular destination in the Harz until the 1960s. After the wall was built it ended up in the out-of-bounds area. Following the reunification of Germany the Heinrichsh√∂he Way was closed.

Sweden (7805/77) was a case decided by European Commission of Human Rights in 1979. Facts In 1973, the Church of Scientology of Sweden placed an advertisement for an E-meter in its periodical. The Consumer Ombudsman, acting upon complaints, requested Market Court an injunction prohibiting the use of certain passages in the advertisement, namely that it was an invaluable aid to measuring man's mental state and changes in it. The court granted the injunction, and the Church's petition was rejected by the Supreme Court. Decision The commission declared the application inadmissible. Concerning Article 9 of the Convention (freedom of religion), it mentioned that the Market Court did not prevent the Church from selling the E-meter or even advertising it for sale as such and stated that the concept, contained in the first paragraph of Article 9, concerning the manifestation of a belief in practice does not confer protection on statement of purported religious belief which appear as selling 'arguments' in advertisements of a purely commercial nature by a religious group, therefore founding no interference with Church's rights. Concerning Article 10 (freedom of expression), the Commission found an interference with applicant's rights. However, it found the interference necessary in a democratic society, stating that the test of 'necessity' in the second paragraph of Article 10 should therefore be a less strict one when applied to restraints imposed on commercial 'ideas' (compared with 'political' ideas). The case was also significant, since the Commission recognised in its decision the right of a church to petition on behalf of its members, changing the previous practice.

It was raised in June 1940 and was assigned to the 25th Brigade, 7th Division. It initially served in the United Kingdom where it undertook defensive duties before being moved to the Middle East in 1941. After taking part in the fighting in Syria and Lebanon, the battalion undertook garrison duties around Tripoli before being transferred back to Australia in 1942. In late 1942 the battalion was sent to New Guinea to fight against the Japanese along the Kokoda Track. They subsequently fought a number of battles throughout 1942, 1943 and early 1944. Their last campaign came in mid-1945 when they landed on Borneo. After the war the battalion was disbanded in March 1946. History Formation The battalion was formed in the United Kingdom on 27 June 1940 from Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) personnel that had originally been designated for service in non-infantry roles who were grouped together to form an infantry battalion. Initially designated as the \\"70th Battalion\\",. due to manpower shortages at first it was composed of only three rifle companies instead of the normal establishment of four.. Many personnel were drawn from the 2/1st Anti-Tank Regiment at this time. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Horace Strutt the battalion was initially based at Tidworth. In August 1940, Strutt was replaced with Lieutenant Colonel Ragnar Garrett as commanding officer. In October 1940, the battalion's designation was changed to the \\"2/31st Battalion\\" in order to bring it in line with the designations of the rest of the 2nd AIF, and it moved to Colchester.. In November, the battalion was assigned to the 25th Brigade.. It was during this time the battalion suffered its first casualty, when one of its members was killed in a German air raid.. While in England the battalion undertook training and was employed on defensive duties, guarding against a possible invasion by German forces. The circumstances of the battalion's establishment overseas resulted in the situation of the battalion's personnel being issued two different Unit colour patches (UCP). Personnel who were in the United Kingdom at the end of 1940 were issued with a circular UCP consisting of black over red, with a border of grey. However, this UCP was issued without reference to Army Headquarters in Australia, who issued battalion reinforcements in Australia with a UCP consisting of an upright brown and yellow rectangle inside a grey circle: this was intended to link the battalion to the 31st Battalion, which had served during World War I. Upon arrival in the Middle East, though, these patches were replaced with the black and red patches. Middle East In January 1941, with the threat of invasion of England reduced, it was decided to send the 2nd AIF units there to the Middle East and the battalion arrived in Egypt in March 1941. Following this the battalion moved to Palestine where it undertook further training and received a draft of reinforcements which enabled it to raise a fourth company in order to bring it up to establishment. Having been transferred to the 7th Division,. the battalion took up defensive positions around Mersa Matruh before taking part in the Syria-Lebanon campaign, during which it took part in several battles. The first of these came in early June, when the battalion captured the town of Khirbe in Lebanon,. before advancing towards Jezzine. On 13 June, the 2/31st, supported by a troop from the 7th Division Cavalry Regiment, crossed the Litani River bridge and led the advance. Coming under fire from Vichy French troops on the hills overlooking the town, the battalion suffered a number of casualties, including its commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Selwyn Porter.. After clearing the French from the main position around Green Hill, Jezzine was finally secured. Between 15 and 29 June, the French brought up reinforcements and subsequently launched a series of counterattacks against the Australians.. On 17 June, a French attack at Jezzine was repulsed. The 2/31st then launched an unsuccessful attack on \\"Hill 1332\\", a key feature in the area, during which they lost seven killed and 22 wounded. The following day a further 17 men were killed when French aircraft attacked the battalion's positions around the Hotel Egypt.. Throughout the rest of the month, fighting continued around Jezzine until on 29 June the Vichy French began to withdraw.. In early July the 2/31st commenced operations to the north of Jezzine with the aim of securing the high ground around Amatour and Badarane. On the night of 9/10 July they advanced up steep terrain under the cover of a heavy artillery barrage. During the fighting that followed, one of the battalion's members, Private James Gordon, performed the deeds for which he subsequently received the Victoria Cross, crawling forward and single-handedly attacking a French post that was holding up his company's advance.. On 12 July an armistice was signed between the Allies and the Vichy French. Following this, the battalion established itself at Amchite where they undertook occupation duties until mid-September when the 25th Brigade received orders to move to Tripoli.. The 2/31st Battalion was assigned the task of fortifying Jebel Tourbel, about north of Tripoli. Upon completion of this task, the battalion undertook defensive duties there until February 1942.. New Guinea campaigns 1942‚Äì1944 Due to concerns about the entry of Japan into the war in the Pacific, the battalion was brought back to Australia in early 1942. Departing Port Tewfik on 9 February on the MV Vernon,. the battalion arrived at Port Adelaide, South Australia, on 9 March and moved to Camp Woodside. In early April they conducted a road and rail move to Casino, New South Wales, where a weeks' leave was granted before moving on to Caboolture, Queensland.. During this time the battalion undertook defensive duties securing the northern approach to Brisbane during the Battle of the Coral Sea.. From June they began jungle training in preparation for deployment to New Guinea in September where the units of the Militia had been fighting a delaying campaign against the Japanese along the Kokoda Track.. A patrol from the 2/31st Battalion passing along the Brown River in Papua during October 1942 On 31 August, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Colin Dunbar, the battalion was moved to Brisbane where they embarked upon the Cremer bound for Port Moresby. Arriving there on 9 September,. the battalion received orders to proceed towards the Owen Stanley Range.. They arrived at Ioribaiwa on 15 September, however, almost as soon as they arrived they were forced to pull back to Imita Ridge. The Japanese, however, had exhausted their supply lines and were unable to follow and thus the Australian force was able to begin its own advance. On 1 November, the 2/31st was in the vanguard as it entered the village of Kokoda. Following this, Dunbar handed over command of the battalion to Lieutenant Colonel James Miller,. and under his command the battalion took part in significant battles at Gorari and Gona. In December, however, Miller died from scrub typhus,. and has the casualties from combat and disease mounted the battalion was eventually withdrawn from the fighting to Port Moresby from where it embarked to return to Australia in January 1943. By the end of the battalion's involvement in the campaign, only 55 men were fit for duty..
