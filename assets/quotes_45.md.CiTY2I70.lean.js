They publish a Malaysian language newspaper called Solidariti Pekerja. They have branches in Kuala Lumpur and Nilai and members from all three ethnic groups - Malays, Indians (Tamils) and Chinese. It is affiliated internationally with the Committee for a Workers' International (CWI), an international socialist organization headquartered in London, United Kingdom. As an affiliate it is often referred to as CWI Malaysia. History It was founded by Ravichandren who had been a member of Socialist Party of Malaysia (PSM) but adopted the ideas of the CWI while living in the UK . On his return to Malaysia he was asked by the leadership of the PSM to choose between the two organisations and so set about forming a section of the CWI. Political views They believe an independent working class political entity is needed to represent the aspirations and needs of the working class. But to oppose the government is not enough; a programme of demands and a clear strategy to achieve them should also be established. The Socialist Alternative spokesman Yuva Balan explained a key text in Marxist thought by Friedrich Engels The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State in a radio discussion. Relations with the Socialist Party of Malaysia They appear to have a good relationship with the PSM who invited speakers from Committee for a Workers' International to speak at their conference in 2005. The complement was returned in 2006 when V.Selvam, a Central Committee member and founding member of PSM was invited to speak at the conference of Socialist Alternative's sister party in Australia. In 2011 Socialist Alternative took part in a campaign to defend PSM when 30 of its supporters were arrested for \\"reviving the ‚Äòcommunism‚Äô of the Malayan Communist Party\\". A review of Michael Jeyakumar Devaraj‚Äôs ‚ÄúMalaysia at the Crossroads, a Socialist Perspective‚Äù by Peter Taaffe explains some of the differences between the two groups. In an interview with The KL Review the subject of relationships again came up and their spokesperson Yuva Balan emphasised that debate was not intended to discredit any party but to focus on a strategy to defeat capitalism. They continued the debate in a radio broadcast discussing Karl Marx in a Malaysian context Activity They were invited to speak at the Youth Symposium of The Festival of Science on youth movements in the 21st century.http://www.roketkini.com/2014/08/12/utam-anjur- pesta-ilmu-hujung-minggu-ini/ References Category:2008 establishments in Malaysia Category:Political parties established in 2008 Malaysia Category:Socialist parties in Malaysia ","title":"Socialist Alternative (Malaysia)"},{"id":"44964084","text":"Robinsonia is the scientific name of two genera of organisms and may refer to: *Robinsonia (moth), a genus of moths in the family Erebidae *Robinsonia (plant), a genus of plants in the family Asteraceae ","title":"Robinsonia"},{"id":"44964091","text":"Murrurundi Railway Station Murrurundi railway station is a heritage-listed railway station located on the Main Northern line in Murrurundi in the Upper Hunter Shire local government area of New South Wales, Australia. It was built between 1872 and 1917. It is also known as Murrurundi Railway Station group. The station serves the town of Murrurundi and opened on 4 April 1872. The station served as the terminus of the line until it was extended to Quirindi on 13 August 1877. The station was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. Services Murrurundi is served by NSW TrainLink's daily Northern Tablelands Xplorer service operating between Armidale/Moree and Sydney. This station is a request stop, so the train only stops here if passengers have booked to board/alight here.  History  From 1891 until August 1965, Murrurundi had a four road locomotive depot to the north of the station, primarily as a base for bank engines used on the steeply graded banks over the Liverpool Range to Ardglen Tunnel north of the town. A yard existed opposite the station.Locomotive Depot No 18: Murrurundi Murrurundi Historical Society  Description  The station has one platform and a passing loop. The complex comprises a type 3, second class, brick station with hip-roof, erected in 1872; a type 18, brick gable building, non-standard, erected ; a type 18, infill between buildings, erected possibly in 1891; an open timber framed signal box with a non-standard roof, erected in 1917; and a timber store building with a skillion roof. Other structures include brick platform faces.  Heritage listing  Murrurundi was an important locomotive depot with a substantial straight shed and locomotive facility at the west end of the yard, all of which has been removed. The remaining structures comprising the station buildings, footbridge, residences and goods shed are a good representative group and are individually good examples of their kind. The station is particularly interesting because of the two buildings constructed within a year of each other in different styles. The main building being a fine second class building and the other a more modest gable roof building. The section linking them and adding the awning is also of significance. The residences are all excellent examples of residences for various positions at the complex from station master to loco foreman and the range from brick to timber is representative of many similar structures. The site is visually important in Murrurundi and with the nearby Temple Court station form an important and significant group of structures.

She grew up partly in the Hokianga, one of the first areas of European settlement in New Zealand and the birthplace of Roman Catholicism in the country. While no longer a practising Catholic, curator Philip Clarke noted in 2010 that 'Catholic knowledge and sensibilities remain deeply ingrained and these sensibilities continue to inform and be celebrated within her jewellery practice'. Education Art historians Damian Skinner and Kevin Murray give Daly as an example of one of the early jewellers to emerge from new tertiary courses in their 2014 history of contemporary jewellery in New Zealand and Australia.

Career She became a partner in Fingers Contemporary Jewellery in 1991, and taught at the Manukau Institute of Technology until 2004. According to Helen Schamroth, Daly \\"aims for integrity in her jewellery by seeking to make social commentary based on her own experience of a Catholic upbringing, and wants the ideas to ring true because they are more than superficial observations...Daly is interested in the function of jewellery as a signifier of the ways in which the body is understood and positioned in society.\\" Her early work included icons of the Madonna, presented in brooches and pendants, in materials from gold-leaf to paper collages. She creates beaded and embroidered surfaces recalling religious garments and church adornments, and has used angel, heart, skull and wing motifs. She has also used Catholic ex votos in brooches. Daly has participated widely in group exhibitions, and held various solo shows.

Synopsis Filmed in Supermarionation tells the story of the development of Supermarionation, a term coined to describe the unique form of puppetry employed by the teams at AP Films and Century 21 studios under the watchful eyes of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson. The documentary is hosted by Lady Penelope and Parker, the puppet stars of Thunderbirds, who seek to uncover the story behind their creation. Stand By For Action!, Network On Air. Production Filmed in Supermarionation is notable for the filmmakers' efforts to create new puppet and special effects sequences that match the look and feel of the programmes produced by AP films during the 1960s. Dialogue was recorded with members of the original Thunderbirds voice cast and puppets and sets were recreated to as close to the specification of the original Supermarionation series as possible. In addition to attempting to recreate 1960s film-making techniques, 21st century methods were also employed in the interest of matching the original productions. Although special effects sequences were shot on 35mm film stock, puppet sequences were captured digitally. This allowed for the image to be manipulated in post production to better match the unique qualities of 1960s film photography. The digital workflow also allowed for wire removal and digital set extensions to be utilised.Filming in Supermarionation, YouTube.

The attack killed Ramazova and injured two police officers, one of whom later succumbed to his wounds. Ramazova was the pregnant widow of a Norwegian-Chechen ISIS fighter in Syria who had been killed in December 2014. Attack Istanbul governor Vasip Sahin said the woman, who reportedly spoke English with \\"a thick accent\\" and was dressed in a niqab, entered the police station and told officers she had lost her wallet before detonating the bomb. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoƒülu told reporters that the bomber was carrying two other devices, which were safely defused by officers on the scene. Emergency services rushed to the blast site, while the tram line that runs through the district was temporarily suspended. Besides the perpetrator only one other person died in the attack; a young police officer from Trabzon who just become a father. Perpetrator Six people, including three foreigners, were detained over the attack. On January 7, the far-left armed group Revolutionary People's Liberation Party‚ÄìFront (DHKP/C) claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was meant \\"to punish (the) murderers of Berkin Elvan\\" and \\"to call to account the fascist state that protects AKP's corrupt, stealing ministers\\". Berkin Elvan was a 15-year-old boy who was killed by a tear-gas canister fired by a police officer during the 2013 Istanbul protests. The bombing came five days after another member of DHKP/C attacked police on guard outside the Ottoman-era Dolmabah√ße Palace, hurling two grenades that failed to explode. The building houses the Istanbul offices of the Turkish prime minister. The group also claimed that the suicide bomber was Elif Sultan Kalsen. After being called to a criminal medical center to identify the body, Kalsen's family denied the claims, stating that it was not their daughter. On January 8, 2015, the perpetrator was identified as Diana Ramazova, a Chechen-Russian citizen from Dagestan. She had married Abu Aluevitsj Edelbijev, a Norwegian citizen of Chechen origin in 2014.

In Florence, where his family moved in 1891 following his father, a state counsel who died there in 1895, Morselli attempted to study medicine and literature, but in both cases he did not succeed and had to interrupt his studies. In the following years he had a very turbulent life, with many journeys first in Africa and Latin America, then also in England and France. Morselli was a friend of Giovanni Papini and Giuseppe Prezzolini. After his return to Italy, Morselli started his literary career, which was initially quite difficult, such that his mother had to support him for long time. In 1910 his tragicomedy Orione obtained a great success, but Morselli did not reach economic stability until 1919, with the success of Glauco, a drama given in Rome. Morselli was also film director and screenplayer. He died of tuberculosis in a Roman hospital in 1921. The works of Morselli are based on the classical myths, revisited from a modern viewpoint. His most successful works are Orione, a tragicomedy where the main character is a demigod with very unspiritual desires, and Glauco, which describes the story of a fisher who becomes god of the sea but discovers that power does not necessarily bring joy. Morselli, portraying antiheroes, represented an alternative to the spirit of D'Annunzio. With his short story La donna ragno (The spider woman, 1915), Morselli was in addition one of the precursors of the science fiction in Italy. His play Belfagor was used by Claudio Guastalla as subject for the libretto of the opera with the same title (1926) of Ottorino Respighi.

Prior to collaborating, Gillie worked as a model, and Marc was an artist from Melbourne working in an advertising agency. The Schattners first exhibited as a pair in Singapore in 1990. Upon returning to Australia in 1999, they had a joint exhibition called Life Can‚Äôt Wait, painting portraits of twenty Australians who face death and were on the organ waiting list. The project was sponsored by the Australian Red Cross Blood Service and was used to create awareness and encourage the public to sign up to be organ donors. In 2006 they were Archibald Prize finalists for a portrait of former Olympic swimmer John Konrads representing his battle with bi-polar disorder. They made their first hybrid human-animal heads in 2005; they created the characters Dogman and Rabbitgirl, (who later became Rabbitwoman) in 2011. Their work has been stolen, and the nude figures have generated controversy.  Public Sculptures   The Paparazzi Dogs  Hunter Street, Newcastle, Australia In 2013 Gillie and Marc created a series of sculptures depicting a dog holding a camera, which were exhibited in Melbourne, Sydney, Singapore, Beijing, Shanghai and New York City. The Last Three In March 2017, Gillie and Marc announced plans to build what they claimed would be the \\"world's largest rhino sculpture\\" in Astor Place New York's East Village to raise awareness for rhino conservation. On March 14, 2018 the17-feet tall sculpture was unveiled representing Sudan, Najin and Fatu - the last three Northern White Rhinos. Coincidentally, 3 days after the installation of The Last Three, Sudan, the last male Northern White Rhino died. Flowers were brought to the sculpture's base. The art-critic Jerry Saltz called the work \\"a Kitschy Monstrosity,\\" saying it was \\"an ugly, bathos-filled folly that proves my adage that 95 percent of all public sculpture is crap\\" and \\"little more than a place to take selfies.\\"  Statues for Equality  On Women's Equality Day (August 26) 2019 a group of 10 commissioned bronze sculptures were unveiled at 1285 Avenue of the Americas in New York City. All the pieces were created by Gillie and Marc. The 10 sculptures depict Oprah Winfrey, P!nk, Nicole Kidman, Jane Goodall, Cate Blanchett, Tererai Trent, Janet Mock, Tracy Dyson, Cheryl Strayed and Gabby Douglas.  Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Gillie and Marc created a bronze likeness of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The work was created in 2019, with Ginsburg's cooperation, as part of their installation \\"Statues for Equality.\\" The sculpture will be installed on March 15, 2021 in a Downtown Brooklyn outdoor mall.  Other Works  Other Rhino sculptures have been installed in city of Dubbo, Australia, La Trobe University, and Sydney's Tamarama Beach where the sculpture won the Allen's People's Choice Award and Kids' Choice Award after it survived a king tide. They have also made sculptures of lions, tigers, and other animals.  New York City Chinatown Controversy  In 2018 they gained attention and controversy for two public sculptures in New York City. Gillie and Marc created a sculpture to celebrate the Chinese ‚ÄòYear of the Dog‚Äô titled \\"He knew this was going to be a year of good fortune.\\" The sculpture show their Dogman character holding a very large red apple. One copy was installed in a Melbourne shopping mall, while the other was intended to be unveiled the day before the Lunar New Year in New York City's Chinatown at Kimlau Square, which holds a memorial to Chinese-American World War II veterans. The Chinatown community prevented the work from being installed. Led by Amy Chin, Special Advisor for Cultural Initiatives of the Chinatown Partnership, the community circulated a petition that said it would have been demeaning to place the statue, ‚Äúunder the Arch named for Lt. Benjamin R. Kimlau,‚Äù who died in World War II fighting for the United States. ‚ÄúThis insulting image of a ‚ÄòDog-Man‚Äô has no place next to this sacred and solemn community site where we honor our community heroes.‚Äù The petition gained more than 300 signatories within the first 24 hours. Questions have also been raised about the process used to select the project for one of the neighborhood‚Äôs most visible public spaces. Karlin Chan, the lone Chinese member of the Parks, Recreation, Cultural Affairs, & Waterfront Committee of Community Board 3, said that the sculpture is reflective of ‚Äúa well- intentioned but wrong approach.‚Äù [31] However, Wellington Chen, the head of the LDC, said ‚ÄúChinatown is the biggest victim. The neighborhood is not as vibrant as it was before. The sculpture was to be placed here to bring tourists in. Now Chinatown is bleeding.‚Äù Personal life Gillie and Marc met in 1990 during a film shoot in Hong Kong, where Gillie was a model and Marc was the creative director. She is Catholic and he is Jewish. They married through a Hindu ceremony seven days later. They have lived in Singapore, New York, and now live in Sydney.

After, he was the seneschal of Normandy for 22 years under two dukes of Normandy, Henry II and Richard I, from 1178 to 1200. Life William FitzRalph owned land in Derbyshire and was the High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and the Royal Forests from 1169 until 1177. FitzRalph was appointed the seneschal of Normandy in 1177 and was in office from 1178. He took over the position permanently from Richard of Ilchester, who stepped down acting seneschal to return to the English exchequer. FitzRalph resided in and owned Caen, where in January 1183 he presided over Henry II of England's court there, Caen also being the home of the Exchequer of Normandy. He held court in Argentan, Bernai, Longueville, Neufch√¢tel, Saint-Wandrille, and Rouen. When Richard I of England became duke in 1189, FitzRalph's position was reconfirmed, making him the only seneschal of Richard's French possessions to keep his office; Stephen of Tours was replaced in Anjou by Payn de Rochefort, Peter Bertin was made seneschal of Poitou, and Helie de la Celle was made seneschal of Gascony. The prestige of the office of seneschal of Normandy increased during FitzRalph's tenure, and began to fulfill the same functions as the Justiciar of England. Charles Haskins believed that the seneschal had enhanced importance partly due to FitzRalph's personality, as he became second only to the sovereign in all administrative matters, however, Jacques Boussard's viewed the power and eminence of the position as resulting from Richard of Ilchester's work in reorganising the exchequer. FitzRalph continued as seneschal until his death in 1200. William Marshal stated that FitzRalph was \\"brave and wise but too old to fight\\" after a French courtier jokingly suggested that he should be one of King Henry's champions.\\"L'Histoire de Guillaume le Marechal\\", ed.

Meyer, 3 vols, Pris 1891-94, i, lines 7517-28, 7596-604 (iii, 88-90) At an unknown date, William FitzRalph had a son, Robert FitzRalph, who became Archdeacon of Nottingham around 1185 and later became Bishop of Worcester on 1 July 1190.\\"British History Online Bishops of Worcester\\" accessed 2 January 2015. William seems to have a considerable interest in pious works. Through Robert he granted to Darley Abbey st Michael's Church, Derby, and the chapel of Alvaston.

Though the novel was written sometime in the late 1960s and early 1970s, it was not published until 2014 when it became her first novel published in 48 years. It helped to spur a revival of interest in her body of work. Plot The novel is about the lives of two sets of siblings, the privileged Howard siblings Russell and Zoe, who are the children of elite Australian botanists, and the Quayle siblings Stephen and Anna who were orphaned at a young age and raised by an uncle consumed with caring for his mentally-ill wife. Russell and Stephen meet by accident on a train and later Russell invites Stephen and his sister to spend time with him and his family. Zoe is immediately struck by Stephen's condescending attitude and his refusal to kowtow to her demands. Believing him to be hyper-intelligent, she is shocked to discover he works as a salesman. Anna, who is shy, develops a crush on Russell. However, Russell is engaged, soon marries, and moves to Europe with his new bride shortly after meeting the Quayle siblings. Stephen leaves Sydney for Melbourne around the same time after receiving a promotion. Zoe graduates from high school and moves to Paris to work in photography and film. Anna meanwhile stays behind in Sydney and gains independence working in an office. She stays in contact with the Howard family and eventually marries an acquaintance of theirs who is much older than she, and with whom she is not in love, only to be widowed shortly after. When Zoe is 25 she returns to Sydney after the death of her mother, just missing seeing her alive by a day. She reconnects with Stephen and after a short and passionate courtship the two marry. Despite her life being in Paris she decides to stay in Sydney, ignoring the warnings of her friends and family that life there won't suit her. Stephen and Russell go into business together running a left-wing political paper. Because of the now deep ties between the Howard and Quayle families, Anna and Russell are able to spend more time together and fall in love though there is a tacit understanding between them that their relationship cannot be expressed. Fifteen years later when Zoe is 40 she reflects back on how her marriage has changed her to an insecure and unhappy woman. She no longer feels passionately in love with Stephen and feels that their relationship exists on the basis of him criticizing her. Meanwhile, Russell's wife Lily falls into a depression after her twin daughters win ballet scholarships to study in London. After talking to Zoe, Lily decides that they should sell their business and she should return to academia, the career she wanted to pursue before she had children. They decide to announce the news at Lily's birthday party, however on the day of the party Zoe receives a suicide note from Anna saying that she and Russell are in love and she can no longer bear to live without him. Russell goes to look for Anna and Zoe is left to comfort Lily, who realizes that her marriage is over. Unable to find Anna, the siblings contact the police only to be called by Stephen shortly after who informs them that Anna is with him. Anna later reveals that the suicide note was written years earlier and was accidentally sent instead of the Christmas cards she intended to post. After seeing how Russell and Anna intend to be together and how Lily is forging a new life going to London to be closer to her daughters, Stephen and Zoe sit down and discuss the state of their marriage and their unhappiness together. Stephen tells Zoe he wants to return to school and get an advanced degree in chemistry and urges Zoe to return to her work in film. No longer having career ambitions that way, Zoe nevertheless feels that a new chapter of her life is about to begin. Publication history Harrower wrote the novel after receiving a Commonwealth Literary Fund fellowship in 1968. However, she was not satisfied with the result and called the act of writing it \\"forced labour\\". In 1971, shortly before it was to be published, Harrower withdrew the book from publication. She deposited the completed novel with the National Library of Australia and stopped writing entirely. In 2012 Harrower was approached by Michael Heyward and Penny Hueston, editors of the independent press Text Publishing, who wanted to reprint her works. They attempted to persuade Harrower to publish In Certain Circles and she eventually acquiesced, allowing the novel to be published in 2014. Reception The novel received positive reviews upon publication. The Guardian called the work \\"subtle yet wounding, and very much alive\\", praising it as \\"a graceful reply to the questions of what really shapes us, and what might actually constitute a wasted life.\\" The Wall Street Journal called the novel \\"a treasure from an unearthed time capsule\\" and praised Harrower as \\"one of the great Australian writers of the postwar era.\\" In 2015 it won the Voss Literary Prize for best novel published in 2014.

It is named after the Limmat, and it follows the right-hand (eastern) bank of that river for about through the Altstadt, or historical core, of the city. The street was once important for both road and public transportation, but today sections of it form a pedestrian zone shared with Z√ºrich's trams, effectively forming a northern extension of the Seeuferanlage promenades that ring the shores of Lake Z√ºrich. The Limmatquai has its southern end adjacent to the Quaibr√ºcke bridge and Bellevueplatz square, where the Limmat flows out of Lake Z√ºrich. Its northern end is at the Bahnhofbr√ºcke bridge and Central plaza. Between the Quaibr√ºcke and the Bahnhofbr√ºcke, the river is crossed by four other bridges all of which connect to the Limmatquai; from south to north these are the M√ºnsterbr√ºcke, Rathausbr√ºcke, Rudolf-Brun-Br√ºcke and M√ºhlesteg. For most of its length, the street runs directly alongside the river, with buildings only on its eastern side, and with a clear view across the river to the west. The only buildings abutting the street from the west are the Wasserkirche, located on what was originally an island within the river, together with the Rathaus (town hall) and a police station, which both form part of the Rathausbr√ºcke bridge structure.  History  Map of the area from the Murerplan of 1576, showing absence of the Limmatquai In the 12th and 13th century, the houses alongside the east bank of the Limmat were built directly on the shore, and were accessed from Oberdorfstrasse and Niederdorfstrasse on their landward sides. Over the course of the following centuries, the Limmat was increasingly channeled, and it can be demonstrated that the right bank of the Limmat is now up to in front of the original bank. Although the Limmatquai as a through road along the river side dates from the 19th century, it was actually built in several sections at different times and under different names, and the name Limmatquai has only applied to the full length of the current street since 1933. Limmatquai as seen from Central around the 1880s The section downstream of the Marktgasse lane and the Rathaus was originally known as Marktststrasse or Altes Limmatquai, and was built in two stages, south of Rosengasse between 1823 and 1825, and to the north between 1855 and 1859. The section between the Rathaus and the steps up to Grossm√ºnsterplatz was originally known as Rathausquai and was built in 1835/36, along with the M√ºnsterbr√ºcke. The section upstream of the steps was originally known as Sonnenquai and was built between 1835 and 1839. In the years 1887 to 1891 the whole street was broadened, and the Limmatquai assumed its present appearance.  Points of interest  Rathaus, and the guild houses zur Saffran, zur Haue, zum R√ºden and zur Zimmerleuten, as seen from M√ºnsterbr√ºcke. The churches of Grossm√ºnster and Wasserkirche are both adjacent to the Limmatquai, although both predate its construction. The Grossm√ºnster lies to the east, at the top of a flight of stairs, whilst the Wasserkirche lies on a former river island joined to the street. Among the numerous secular buildings of interest on the street are the Haus zum R√ºden, the guild houses of Zimmerleuten, Haue and Saffran, and the Rathaus that was the seat of the assemblies of the city and of the cantonal parliaments. The area of the former Rathausquai Views across the river from the Limmatquai include the Fraum√ºnster church, the Hotel zum Storchen, the Schipfe and the Lindenhof. The Limmatquai is also one of the main attractions for tourists, and has many small shops, caf√©s and restaurants.  Transport  The street and tram tracks Z√ºrich tram lines 2, 4 and 15 traverse the Limmatquai between Bellevue and Central stops, calling at the intermediate stops at Helmhaus, Rathaus and Rudolf-Brun-Br√ºcke. The Limmat tour boats operated by the Z√ºrichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft call at a landing stage mid-way along the Limmatquai on their route between Z√ºrichhorn and the Landesmuseum. Most private vehicles are prohibited; the area is the largest pedestrian zone of Z√ºrich. Since 25 September 2004, the driving of motor vehicles, motorcycles and scooters is forbidden, except for goods transport, traffic towards Weinplatz, postal delivery services, and doctors and emergency services. Private road transport between Central and Brun bridge and Uraniastrasse (Urania Sternwarte) at the site of the former Oetenbach nunnery is still allowed, as well as between the former upper Limmatquai and Bellevueplatz at the upper end of the Limmat, as the road traffic via Utoquai and R√§mistrasse still uses the Bellevue house area as a turning point towards General-Guisan-Quai.  Future developments  According to the project Riviera, the waterfront promenade between Utoquai, Quaibr√ºcke and Limmatquai will be planted with two-row lines of Chestnut trees, and along the staircase to the Limmat will be added a third detached tree row of Styphnolobium japonicum. The garden restaurant Terrasse will be redesigned, while the snack stand is maintained. Bus and motorized road transport operate in the future on a common track, meaning the separate bus lane at Utoquai is repealed, but on the river shore a bidirectional cycle path added.  Culture  The Sechsel√§uten parade on Limmatquai The best-known event on the Limmatquai is the annual Sechsel√§uten parade which traverses the street on its way to Sechsel√§utenplatz. The fictitious 2007 Swiss mystery film Marmorea was filmed at the Burgh√∂lzli sanatory in the Weinegg district, on the Limmat near Technopark Z√ºrich, at the Limmatquai promenade, and on the M√ºnsterbr√ºcke river crossing towards M√ºnsterhof. Between April 2014 and January 2015, an art installation known as the Hafenkran or Z√ºrich maritim project was present on the Limmatquai. The installation comprised an old harbour crane from Dresden, together with a number of bollards and a port horn located on different high- rise buildings in Z√ºrich. The installation proved controversial, and polarized the public and the political establishment of Z√ºrich.  Bibliography  * Das Limmatquai vor und nach der Neugestaltung.

Anciently, it belonged to the Rhodians, according to Hecataeus, quoted by Stephanus.Steph. B. s. v. ŒöŒøœÅœçŒ¥Œ±ŒªŒªŒ±. But it was not in Rhodes, nor was it one of the Rhodian possessions in the Peraea, Caria.Plin. v. 25; Ptol. v. 3.

There are coins of Corydala of the imperial period, with the epigraph ŒöŒøœÅœÖŒ¥Œ±ŒªŒªŒµœâŒΩ. Bishopric At an early stage, Corydala became the seat of a Christian bishop, a suffragan of the metropolitan see of Myra, the capital of the Roman province of Lycia. In a letter to Amphilochius of Iconium, Saint Basil the Great mentions Bishop Alexander of Corydala as a champion of orthodoxy. Bishop Solon took part in the Council of Ephesus in 431. Palladius was a signatory of the letter that the bishops of Lycia sent in 458 to Byzantine Emperor Leo I the Thracian with regard to the murder of Proterius of Alexandria. Leo or Leontius was the name of a bishop of the see who was at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787.

Containing a planetarium, a giant screen theater, exhibits, a 15,000-object collection, educational classes, and public outreach, it opened in October 2012 as a successor to Peoria's Lakeview Museum of Arts & Sciences, established in 1965. Description The museum building is adjacent to the historic Rock Island Depot and Freight House. A specialty resource of the Peoria Riverfront Museum is the \\"Illinois River Encounter\\", a family-oriented gallery that attempts to be the definitive aquarium of the Illinois River, which flows adjacent to the museum. Adjacent displays describe the ecology, social history, and engineering of the working river. The museum's collections include fine art (paintings, sculptures, works on paper), decorative art (furniture, ceramics, metal, glass, textiles), folk art (paintings, sculptures, graphics, decorative arts, etc.), ethnographic art (Native American, African, Oceanic, Asian), natural science artifacts (rocks and minerals, insects, shells), and historic artifacts including a Duryea Motor Wagon Company car, theater and opera posters, and square dancing items. The museum also owns a significant collection of folk art wildfowl decoy carvings. Development The Peoria Riverfront Museum opened on October 20, 2012 as a successor to the Lakeview Museum of Arts and Sciences, which was founded by private citizens in 1965 as the Lakeview Center and whose building was then given to and maintained by the Peoria Park District while its operations remained entirely private. Lakeview Museum was located in the north central suburban Lakeview Park in Peoria. It was also home to more than 50 member clubs, hobby groups, and organizations who formed an independent arts and sciences council whose members had helped start the museum. Lakeview Museum officials led the campaign for the new museum, and its collections, trustees and staff formed the foundation of the Peoria Riverfront Museum operation when it opened. The Peoria Riverfront Museum was funded by private contributions with support from donated land by the city of Peoria and support for the building by a tax referendum approved by voters of Peoria County. The operations are supported by donations and earned revenue while the building and grounds are owned by Peoria County and leased to the museum by public-private partnership agreement. Key to the agreement was the enactment by local voters of a supplemental sales tax. An admission fee is charged to museum nonmembers. The museum has had more than 1.1 million visitors since its opening.

First unveiled by the company on January 5, 2015, it is a successor to the original LG G Flex released in 2013. The design of the G Flex 2 resembles the LG G3, and as with the original, is differentiated primarily by its curved body and flexible display. LG announced several changes from the original G Flex design, including a smaller, higher-resolution display; reduced body curvature; stronger, chemically-treated screen glass; and a new iteration of the original's \\"self-healing\\" back cover that can more quickly repair minor abrasions. It was unveiled on January 5, 2015 at Consumer Electronics Show, and was released in South Korea in late-January 2015.  History and development  The original LG G Flex, released in 2013 as LG's first smartphone with a flexible display and curved chassis, was met with mixed reception, with critics likening the device to a proof of concept rather than a mainstream product. Although the device was praised for its durability and overall performance, the G Flex's display was criticized for having bleeding edge quality, with a 720p panel at only 245 pixels per inch (as opposed to the 1080p screens used by other major high-end phones), a grainy appearance, and noticeable image retention. The G Flex was also panned for its large size, high price, and for lacking functionality specifically meant to take advantage of the device's curved screen. LG intended the G Flex 2 to address criticisms surrounding the original G Flex: the device was given a more compact design with a softer curve to improve its ergonomics and appearance, and a higher quality 1080p display. Work was done to make the G Flex 2 more shock resistant: its elasticity evenly distributes shocks from impacts across the chassis. LG designer Ramchan Woo demonstrated how the device could withstand certain types of abuse without any major damage, such as being dropped, stepped on, and sat on. To further improve the durability of the device's Gorilla Glass 3 display, the glass also goes through a chemical treatment process developed by LG known as \\"Dura-Guard\\". LG claimed that the treatment would improve the screen's durability by around 20%, especially near the edges of the display As with the original G Flex, it will be positioned as a niche product intended for a premium market.  Specifications  The G Flex 2's physical design resembles that of the LG G3, consisting of a curved polycarbonate shell, with volume and power buttons located on the rear of the device directly below the camera. The device is available on-launch in red and silver color schemes. The curvature of the G Flex 2's display remains 700 millimetres (28 in), but the curvature of the rest of the body was reduced to 650 millimetres (26 in) to create a more subtle \\"bend\\" in its shape than the original. The G Flex 2's rear cover features a \\"self-healing\\" coating which can repair minor scratches and abrasions made to it; the updated version is able to repair itself quicker than the original, taking only around 10 seconds rather than in minutes. As opposed to the 6-inch, 720p display of the original, its flexible OLED display was reduced to 5.5 inches in size, but upgraded to 1080p resolution. The G Flex 2 uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 system-on-chip with 2 or 3 GB of LPDDR4 RAM. The remainder of its specifications are similar to that of the G3, with either 16 or 32 GB of expandable storage, a 3,000 mAh battery (albeit non-removable), and a 13-megapixel camera with hybrid autofocus. The G Flex 2 runs Android 5.0 \\"Lolipop\\" with a custom skin and software similar to the G3. The new \\"Glance View\\" feature allows users to view notifications when the display is off by dragging down.

Melville based the fictional whale partially on a real albino whale of that period called Mocha Dick. Description Ishmael describes Moby Dick as having two prominent white areas around \\"a peculiar snow-white wrinkled forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump\\", the rest of his body being of stripes and patches between white and gray.Ch 41, ‚ÄúThe Whale,‚Äù Melville, Herman. (1851) Moby~Dick or, the Whale'.'

USA: University Press of Kansas. p. 432. and that Moby Dick is possibly the largest sperm whale that ever lived. Ahab tells the crew that the White Whale can be told because it has an unusual spout, a deformed jaw, three punctures in his right fluke and several harpoons embedded in his side from unsuccessful hunts.Chapter 36. \\"The Quarter-Deck\\", Melville, Herman. (1851) Moby~Dick or, the Whale. Yet Ishmael insists that what invested the whale with \\"natural terror\\" was that \\"unexampled, intelligent malignity\\" which he had shown in his assaults. When he fled before \\"exalting pursuers\\", giving every symptom of alarm, he would suddenly turn round and stave their boats to splinters or drive them back to their ship. What seemed the White Whale's \\"infernal aforethought of ferocity\\" that every dismembering or death that he caused was not wholly regarded as that of an \\"unintelligent agent\\". He bit off Ahab's leg, leaving Ahab to swear \\"wild vindictiveness\\" on him.Ch 41, ‚ÄúThe Whale,‚Äù Melville, Herman. (1851) Moby~Dick or, the Whale'.' Ishmael, however, is haunted by a \\"nameless horror\\" so \\"mystical and well nigh ineffable\\" that he could hardly express; it was \\"the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me\\".CHAPTER 42. The Whiteness of The Whale\\", Melville, Herman. (1851) Moby~Dick or, the Whale\\". At the end of the novel, Moby Dick destroys the Pequod. Ahab and the crew are drowned, with the exception of Ishmael. The novel does not say whether Moby Dick survives or not. Real-life models Although attacks by whales on whalers were not at all common, there were instances, of which Melville was aware. One was the sinking of the Nantucket whaler Essex in 1820, after a large sperm whale rammed her 2,000 miles (3,200 km) from the western coast of South America.Faiella, Graham, Moby Dick and the whaling industry of the 19th century, New York : The Rosen Publishing Group, 2004. Cf. Chapter 3, \\"Moby Dick: The Inspiration\\". First mate Owen Chase, one of eight survivors, recorded the events in his 1821 Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whale-Ship Essex. The other event was the alleged killing in the late 1830s of the albino sperm whale Mocha Dick, in the waters off the Chilean island of Mocha. Mocha Dick was rumored to have nineteen harpoons in his back from other whalers, and appeared to attack ships with premeditated ferocity. One of his battles with a whaler served as subject for an article by explorer Jeremiah N. Reynolds in the May 1839 issue of The Knickerbocker or New-York Monthly Magazine.Reynolds, J.N., \\"Mocha Dick: or the White Whale of the Pacific: A Leaf from a Manuscript Journal,\\" The Knickerbocker, or New-York Monthly Magazine. 13.5, May 1839, pp. 377‚Äì392. Melville was familiar with the article, which described: Mocha Dick had over 100 encounters with whalers in the decades between 1810 and the 1830s. He was described as being gigantic and covered in barnacles. Although he was the most famous, Mocha Dick was not the only white whale in the sea nor the only whale to attack hunters., 66‚Äì79 While an accidental collision with a sperm whale at night accounted for sinking of the Union in 1807,Report of the Commissioner By United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries, p115 it was not until August 1851 that the whaler Ann Alexander, while hunting in the Pacific off the Galapagos Islands, became the second vessel since Essex to be attacked, holed and sunk by a whale. Melville remarked: :Ye Gods! What a commentator is this Ann Alexander whale. What he has to say is short & pithy & very much to the point. I wonder if my evil art has raised this monster.Melville's Reflections, a page from The Life and Works of Herman Melville Symbolism Melville presents Moby Dick and his whiteness as a symbol of many things, among them God, nature, fate, evil, the ocean, and the very universe itself. Yet the symbolism of the White Whale is deliberately enigmatic, and its inscrutability is a deliberate challenge to the reader. Ishmael describes the whale‚Äôs forehead as having wrinkles and scars on it that look like hieroglyphics. He muses on the difficulty of understanding what he saw: :If then, Sir William Jones, who read in thirty languages, could not read the simplest peasant‚Äôs face in its profounder and more subtle meanings, how may unlettered Ishmael hope to read the awful Chaldee of the Sperm Whale‚Äôs brow? I but put that brow before you.

Generally, the design is close-fitting, in the manner of the cloche, and frames the head, usually stopping just above the ears. It may be similar to a halo hat in the way that it frames the face and can be worn straight or at an angle. The half-hat is said to have been created by the French-born and US-based milliner Lilly Dach√©, who won an award for the design in 1941. Elizabeth II wore a half hat during a 1954 visit to Queensland History and usage The half hat became popular in the post-war period, especially in the 1950s. This was a design considered suitable for day and evening wear, and some designs included details such as sequins and veils. Designs were often stiffened to create a halo shape ‚Äì a 1952 design from Ascot Millinery was made of decorated straw with an inner lining of velvet. Four Miss America contestants in 1959, with two sporting fashionable half-hat designs While many designs stopped a little way beyond the crown of the head, there was also a fashion for more bonnet-like shapes to half hats. Writing in The Guardian, also in 1952, fashion correspondent Phyllis Heathcote reported on the off-the-brow trend emerging from Paris, noting: \\"the majority of the hats are still very small, very soft, and very much alike, except ‚Äì and this is important ‚Äì that whereas last season and the one before the tendency was to an arched line over the front of the head, leaving the back uncovered, this season the movement tends to uncover the front and cover the back\\". Heathcote also noted the practicality of this shape, describing it as a design that could be folded up and stowed in a handbag or pocket. Such was its popularity in the United States ‚Äì particularly when embellished ‚Äì that a 1957 report in The Times on American hat fashions said: \\"The hat norm, godlike for Hera, is regal for American womanhood...the half-hat, usually jewelled, is plainly a diadem, sometimes secured by jewelled springs behind the head\\". A 1955 half- hat design incorporated into a wedding veil This was a hat design that became popular with brides. A 1955 wedding reported in The Times describes the bride wearing: \\"a beige lace dress of ballerina length with a high upturned collar and a half-hat to match trimmed with fine light-brown feathers\\". An example of the 'eggshell' half hat, also worn by Elizabeth II on her 1954 Australian tour, was trimmed with a pom-pom Variations The half hat could be shaped close to frame the skull in the manner of the Juliet cap (also known as a capulet) and some variations were known as the cape hat; typically in these designs draped fabric or felt was attached to a bicycle clip, creating a more scarf-like effect. Another variation is sometimes informally known as the 'cracked egg hat' or 'eggshell hat', due to its curved and irregular shape and is said to have been popularised by Givenchy and introduced by Dior. A design of this style worn by Queen Elizabeth during a 1954 tour of Australia had the addition of a pom-pom.

It is listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance. It is indirectly named after two M√ºnster (minsters), the Fraum√ºnster and Grossm√ºnster.  Geography  M√ºnsterbr√ºcke crosses the Limmat, connecting M√ºnsterhof and Limmatquai at the historical core of the medieval town of Z√ºrich. It is the second bridge over the Limmat, below the Quaibr√ºcke and above the Rathausbr√ºcke.  Transportation  The Z√ºrich tram lines 2, 4 and 15 run past it on the Limmatquai. The ZSG Z√ºrichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft and its Limmat tour boats pass under it. Individual transportation is limited to road transport use between upper Limmatquai (Bellevueplatz), upstream of the Limmat, and M√ºnsterhof, since the area is part of the pedestrian zone of Z√ºrich.  Architecture  In 1835, the chief engineer of the merchant society of the city of Z√ºrich, Alois Negrelli, initiated the construction of the bridge in collaboration with the master-builders Conrad Stadler and Johann Jakob Locher-Oeri, who engineered the sophisticated wooden scaffold. The foundations of the bridge were based on 472 oak piles with a length of up to , to bear its weight of about 6,100 tons. The foundation was filled with concrete, and the spaces between the piles were reinforced with rubblestones. Above that, cofferdams and caissons were erected and reinforced by sandstone plates that lay on cement mortar. The structure consists of four flat arches with a inside diameter and a height of above the Limmat level, and a fifth arch of above a former channel into the former Kornhaus building opposite the Fraum√ºnster church. The pillars between the arches have a diameter of and are protected by a layer of cement and paneled with black Jura marble. The pillars and cornices and the stones of the traffic lane are made of St. Gotthard granite. The cast-iron railings were produced in the Grand Duchy of Baden. The present bridge has two lanes and sidewalks on both sides, but it is commonly used as a pedestrian and bicycle bridge as road transport is limited between Limmatquai and M√ºnsterhof.

History  The earliest bridge at the location was built in the Roman era, and in medieval Z√ºrich a wooden bridge, called the Obere Br√ºcke (upper bridge), connected the two banks of the Limmat. Between 1836 and 1838, the former wooden bridge was replaced by a stone bridge. Alois Negrelli engineered and supervised the construction of the bridge as it is still present today; it was inaugurated in August 1838. The bridge congested the traffic on the Limmat, so a land connection in the then \\"modern\\" Z√ºrich was urgently needed by replacing the narrow medieval Reichsstrasse towards the present Rathausbr√ºcke crossing. Thus, sections of the present Limmatquai on the eastern shore of the Limmat were built simultaneously. Starting in 1861, the Fraum√ºnster granary temporarily housed in one of its numerous empty rooms the Betraum of the Jewish citizens of Z√ºrich until the Synagoge Z√ºrich L√∂wenstrasse was built in 1881. Until May 1901 and between 1910 and 1924 there was even a tramway crossing the bridge towards Paradeplatz. The original construction has been repaired several times, most recently in the late 1990s.

The Law also establishes the National Council for Science and Technology Development and the National Research Fund. The drafting and adoption of the Law on Education made it possible to launch ‚ÄòThe New Ukrainian School‚Äô, the reform of general secondary education. It was under the chairmanship of Liliia Hrynevych, that the draft Committee prepared the Draft Law on Education and sent it to the Parliament for re-reading in 2016. In 2017 the document was finalized and adopted in the second reading. Among other achievements - the adoption of amendments to the Budget Code, and changes related to the organization of inclusive education. During her tenure during the 7th convocation, Liliia Hrynevych introduced 110 Bills and resolutions, 14 of which have entered into force, and submitted 23 parliamentary inquiries. The total includes 261 amendments to Bills, of which 244 have been adopted. During her tenure during the 8th convocation Liliia Hrynevych has introduced 82 bills and resolutions, 37 of which have entered into force, and submitted 10 parliamentary inquiries. The total included 52 amendments to Bills of which 34 have been adopted.  Activity as Minister of Education and Science of Ukraine (April 2016 -August 2019)  Development of the education system was a priority of Volodymyr Groysman's government. Over the three years of Liliia Hrynevych's work in the Government, the consolidated budget for education increased from UAH 129.4 billion to UAH 246 billion. Particular attention was paid to rising the salaries in the education sector. From 2016 to 2019, teacher salaries increased by over 80%. In pre-school education, the priority was to eliminate the waiting lists for enrolment to kindergartens. Co-operation with local authorities made it possible to shorten the wating lists from 96,000 seats in 2016 to 33,600 in 2019. Liliia Hrynevych led \\"The New Ukrainian School\\" (NUS) - a large-scale reform in general secondary education. Liliia Hrynevych was a co-author of the New Ukrainian School Concept, which defined the principles and objectives of the reform. In December 2016, the Government approved the Policy Proposal to reform the general secondary education. The reform aimed at transition from a \\"knowledge only school\\" to a \\"school of competencies\\", that is the ability to use the obtained knowledge to solve practical problems and form value-based relationships. Minister Liliia Hrynevych suggested implementing the NUS reform in three directions: updating the education content; targeted teacher training; updating the educational environment (purchase of mobile desks, new equipment and training materials). The preparation and implementation of the reform began in 2017 with 100 schools in Ukraine starting to pilot the new programs. The State Standard for Primary Education was approved In February 2018, and in September that year, all first-graders in the country began the school year in the updated learning envirnment with the teachers using modern teaching methods according to the new State Standard. Within the framework of the reform, nearly 50,000 elementary school teachers, more than 11,000 Principals and Deputy Heads of educational institutions took the online and face-to-face in-service training course in blended mode. In 2018, a voluntary teacher certification was introduced aiming to identify teachers with a high professional level, innovative teaching methods and ability to share their experience. The certified teachers are payed a 20% bonus. The Government subsidized the refurbishment of schools and renovation of the educational environment. The state investments in school infrastructure in 2017 amounted to UAH 1 009.5 mln, in 2018 - UAH 2 509 mln, and in 2019 - UAH 3 886.3 mln. The funds were allocated to the priority areas such as elementary school classroom transformation, equipment for the science and mathematics classrooms, the Ukrainian language classrooms in minority language schools, school sports complexes, equipment for the computer classes and the Internet access. The learning conditions for the students in rural areas was a special concern for the Ministry. To improve these, a hub school network was created in May 2019. 785 hub schools and 1,272 hub school branches were established to build up the network in Ukraine. The hub schools and their brances were assigned a priority of establishing modern science, math and computer classes, and transportation of the children from remote villages by school buses. The Coordination Council was established to promote collaboration between the local executive and self-governing bodies and ensure a more effective co- operation between the regional state administrations, local communities and other agencies in the course of the NUS implementation. Liliia Hrynevychformed an ecosystem of organizations with shared concepts of the reform ideas on the partnership pedagogy, lifelong learning, competency-based and learner-centered approaches to learning and teaching, etc. A number of non-governmental organizations, including EdCampUkraine, EdEra, Ukrainian Step by Step Foundation (USSF), Osvitoria, Smart Osvita, BatkiSOS and others, joined this ecosystem . To implement the reform, Minister Liliia Hrynevych build up cooperative relationships with international partners. In particular, the large-scale Finnish-Ukrainian project ‚ÄúLearning together‚Äù attracted ‚Ç¨6 million to assist the implementation of the NUS reform priorities. The Memorandum signed between the Ministry of Education and Science and the LEGO Foundation, made it possible to provide every Ukrainian first-grader and every class with free LEGO kits to support introduction of the game - and activity-based learning into the educational process. An important area of the Ministry of Education and Science activity was development of inclusive education carried out in cooperation with Maryna Poroshenko, the Head of the Poroshenko Charitable Foundation. Between 2016 and 2018, the number of children with special educational needs who enrolled in secondary schools increased from 2 720 to 12 000. Inclusive Resource Centers were set up to assist parents and teachers in creating an individual development program for each child with special educational needs. As Minister, Liliia Hrynevych launched an active anti-bullying campaign. The campaign found its support in the Law passed by the Parliament. The Law provides for counteracting bullying and introduces administrative penalties for bullying during the educational process. Additionally, the new Law on Education introduces the Institute of Educational Ombudsmen to ensure the students‚Äô, educators‚Äô, and scholars‚Äô rights. The Law on Education adopted in September 2017 laid down the main provisions of the educational reform. The adoption of the Law was followed by an extensive discussions of Article 7, which specifies the state language in the education system. The state leaders of Romania and Hungary claimed the language article of the Law restricted the rights of the national minorities in Ukraine. Ukraine addressed the European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission) and asked for its Opinion. In December 2017, when the Venice Commission was considering the legitimacy of Article 7, Liliia Hrynevychprovided convincing arguments and successfully defended the article \\"Language of Education\\". In July 2019, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine recognized the constitutionality of the Law on Education. Pursuant to the Law on Education, the State Service for Education Quality (SSEQ)was established in 2017, which is responsible for upholding the state education standards and ensuring the proper education quality under the decentralized conditions. The basic principle of its activity is to assist educational institutions, management, teachers in improving the quality of their activities as well as the quality of the student learning outcomes. Modernization of vocational education became an important priority of the Ministry's activities under the guidance of Liliia Hrynevych. The implementation of the investment program in 2016-2018 made it possible to create 100 training and practical centers for the most acute professions, where students can learn to work with modern materials, equipment and technologies. The Agreement on financing the EU4Skills Project: Best Skills for Modern Ukraine was signed between Ukraine and the European Commission In 2018. The project attracted EUR 58 million in total and aims to create a network of Professional Excellence Centers, including purchase of new equipment, professional development of masters and teachers, development of new curricula and standards for students. During her time in office, Minister Liliia Hrynevychmodernised the system of admission to higher education institutions. The admission is based on external independent testing (ZNO) results and the entire procedure is carried out online on the principle ‚Äòan offer goes to the best candidate‚Äô. A mandatory standard entrance exam is introduced as secondary admission criteria for the Law and International Law courses. The National Agency for Higher Education Quality Assurance, Higher education competency based standards were developed for 266 specialisms. Minister Liliia Hrynevychpaid special attention to the research development at university. For the first time the government funded a program aimed to create centers for collective use of research equipment at higher education institutions. Establishment of eight centers at Ukrainian universities was funded by the state budget in 2018. In 2019, university research received its first basic funding. Liliia Hrynevychinitiated transformation of the scientific research management and financing system. In 2017‚Äì2018, the budgetary funding of science and research managed by the Ministry increased by 69%. The National Council for Science and TechnologyDevelopment began its work which made impact on the policy-making in the area. The Ukrainian National Research Foundation was launched to be at the forefront of the new funding system, in particular in provision of research grants. In 2017, the Ministry of Education and Science first financed the access of the Ukrainian universities and research institutions to Scopus and the Web of Science. In 2019 these scientometric bases were available for all state budgeted universities and scientific institutions at the state budget costs. Starting in 2018, the Antarctic research at ‚ÄúAkademik Vernadsky‚Äù, a Ukrainian polar station, intensified. The National Antarctic Scientific Center headed by Evgen Dykyi, a marine ecology researcher and Ukrainian activist, renewed its full membership in the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, modernized the station, provided high-quality Internet and communication; Ukrainian women joined the expedition for the first time in 20 years on the mainland. The National Qualification Agency, a collegial body for implementation of the state qualification policy, was established to ensure development of the National Qualification System and compliance of the learning outcomes with the relevant education levels, qualifications and the modern market requirements.  Personal life  As described by Liliia herself, she met her future husband Mykhaylo during their student years, when Liliia was involved in student activities. In particular, she sang in the ‚ÄòCheremosh‚Äô student group. She speaks English and Polish.

One of four brothers in the Camperdown team, White won the club's best and fairest award in 1946, as a full-back. Geelong White was used mostly as a half back by Geelong, which he joined in 1947. In his debut season he made 17 appearances and was described by Jim Blake of the Sporting Globe as one of the \\"best recruits\\" that season. At the end of the season he won Geelong's award for the \\"best first year player\\". It was noted in The Argus that there was confusion at the Brownlow Medal count that year when a vote was awarded to \\"White, Geelong\\", which could also have been for his teammate Lindsay White.

Small (1947‚Äì1987) was a prominent businessman in Kankakee, Illinois. In 1987, he was kidnapped and held for ransom by Danny Edwards and Nancy Rish. The conditions of his confinement caused him to die of asphyxiation. As a result, Edwards was given the death penalty (later commuted) and Rish was sentenced to life in prison without parole. Small biography Small was born in 1947 and raised in Kankakee, Illinois. His parents, Burrell and Reva Small, owned and operated a media conglomerate called Mid America Media; the Small family also owned the controlling interest in United Press International; and this is where Small himself worked. His great grandfather was Illinois governor Len Small. Stephen Small had received his education at Lake Forest Academy, the University of Denver and Mark Hopkins College.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-09-05/news/8703070428_1_kankakee- police-kidnaped-small/2 Kanakee heir kidnapped In 1969, he married Nancy Pedersen, with whom he had three sons. Kidnapping Around 12:30 a.m. on September 2, 1987, someone claiming to be a Kankakee police officer called the Small home and told Stephen Small that a burglary had occurred at the B. Harley Bradley House, a property that Small owned and was in the process of renovating. Small got dressed and left his home. Around 3:30 that morning someone called the Small residence and told Stephen's wife, Nancy, \\"We have your husband.\\" Nancy then heard her husband say that he had been handcuffed inside a box underground. Small told his wife to obtain $1 million in cash. The caller directed Mrs. Small not to report the matter to the police. The matter was reported to the authorities, however, and devices were connected to the Smalls' telephone line to record incoming calls and to determine their origins. At 5:03 that afternoon, the same person called again, asking Mrs. Small how much money had been collected. This call was placed from a telephone located at a Phillips 66 gas station in Aroma Park. Edwards was seen there at that time, in the company of a blonde-haired woman. At 5:40 p.m., Jean Alice Small, Stephen Small's aunt, telephoned the Small residence to tell them of a call she had just received. Jean said that the caller had told her that he knew that Nancy Small's telephone was tapped. After telling Jean that the victim was buried, the caller threatened to kill Jean's husband. Nancy Small received another telephone call from the kidnapper at 11:28 that night. This call originated from a telephone at a Sunoco station in Aroma Park, where an FBI agent saw a white male at a telephone, and a blonde-haired woman in a car that was later identified as belonging to Nancy Rish, Edwards' girlfriend; Rish had blonde hair. The caller played a tape recording of Stephen Small's voice. On the tape, Stephen provided instructions for delivering the ransom. After audio enhancement, a voice in the background could be heard threatening Small. Tracking and arrest of Edwards and Rish Nancy Small received one more telephone call from the kidnapper, at 11:46 that night. The call was placed from a Marathon service station in Kankakee. The caller accused Nancy of having notified the police and refused her offer of the ransom. Minutes later, at 11:50 p.m., an Illinois State Police officer saw Rish's car, with its trunk partly open, driving from Kankakee toward Aroma Park. Law enforcement officers then placed Edwards' home under surveillance. They saw a dark-colored Buick, with its trunk partly open, arrive at the house in Bourbonnais where Edwards and Rish lived. Edwards and a white woman with blonde hair left the car and went inside. Officers carried out a search of the residence later that morning, on September 3, Rish and Edwards were arrested at that time. Later that day, Edwards led law enforcement officers to the site where the victim was buried. There, officers dug up a wooden box and found the victim's body inside. The box measured about six feet long and three feet wide, and was constructed of plywood. It contained a light connected to an automotive battery, a one gallon jug of water, candy bars, gum, and a flashlight. A medical examiner later determined that the victim died of asphyxiation caused by suffocation. The medical examiner believed that the victim would not have survived more than three or four hours inside the enclosed box. The medical examiner noted that the pipe extending from the box into the open air was too long for its diameter to serve as an adequate air- exchange system. Edwards trial The State presented other evidence connecting Edwards to these offenses. On the night of the victim's disappearance, around midnight, a neighbor of Edwards heard Edwards say, \\"Let's go, let's hit it,\\" get into his car, and drive off. Also, two neighbors of the Small family saw Edwards' van, or one similar to it, parked in their neighborhood after midnight on September 2. One neighbor also noticed a mid- sized car at that time, heard two car doors slam, and saw the car and Edwards' van drive away with their lights off. Several witnesses saw Edwards constructing a wooden box in his garage during summer 1987, preceding the offenses here. Edwards gave various explanations for what he was gonna do, saying that it would be used for a lemonade stand, or by his brother for transporting things, or at his brother's pool in Florida. A neighbor of the Smalls had seen a white van similar to Edwards' van driving through an alley next to the Smalls' home about 10 times that summer. While Edwards and Rish were visiting a boat store that summer, Edwards saw Stephen Small leaving the store in a sports car; Edwards was heard to say, \\"Boy, it sure would be nice to afford stuff like that.\\" The search of Edwards's residence at the time of his arrest turned up a Kankakee telephone book with the name \\"Small\\" circled. Edwards' boots were found behind a washer and dryer at the residence, and soil on the boots matched a sample from the location where the box was buried. Soil in Edwards' van also matched the sample. White caulking material on gloves found in Edwards' trash had the same chemical composition as the caulking material used to fill in the seams of the wooden box in which the victim had been buried. Edwards' fingerprints were found on PVC pipe and duct tape recovered from the box. A person who owed Edwards money had had a pair of handcuffs stolen from him, and the same pair was later discovered on the victim. Another person who owed Edwards money had had a gun stolen, and it was found by investigators in the countryside near Aroma Park. Edwards purchased a battery that was found in the wooden box. Bolt cutters belonging to a company owned by Edwards' brother were found at a point between where the box was uncovered and where the victim's car was found, and they could have been the implement used to cut the chain connecting the handcuffs on the victim's wrists. Edwards sentence At the close of evidence, the jury found Edwards guilty of first degree murder and aggravated kidnapping. A capital sentencing hearing was then conducted. At the first stage of the hearing, the jury found Edwards eligible for the death penalty because of his commission of murder during the course of another felony, aggravated kidnapping.THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, Appellee, v. DANIEL J. EDWARDS, Appellant. Nancy Rish On September 2, 1987, during the kidnapping and murder of Kankakee business man Stephen B. Small, the investigation focused on Danny Edwards and Nancy Rish, who lived together in a townhouse in Bourbonnais. On September 4, a search warrant was executed for the townhouse. That evening, Edwards led the police to a rural area where Small's body was recovered. It appeared that Small had been placed in a wooden box which had been fitted with a PVC pipe designed to give him air for 24 to 48 hours. Small's wrists were handcuffed and the box was buried. The coroner later determined that his death was caused by \\"asphyxia due to suffocation.\\" That same night, the police arrested Rish and held her at the station for questioning. Rish requested a specific attorney, J. Scott Swaim, who had previously represented her, and she was given an opportunity to obtain his counsel. Rish did not know that Swaim was friends with the victim. For the next four days, between September 4 and September 8, the police questioned Rish with counsel present. Eight statements were elicited concerning her knowledge and actions in the early days of September. None of the statements was totally consistent with any other. Rish trial On October 1, Rish was charged by indictment with first-degree murder and aggravated kidnapping for her alleged role in Small's death. On November 2, 1988, Rish was tried by a jury. No direct evidence was presented linking her to the kidnapping or death of Small. However, the State was able to enter Rish's eight inconsistent statements into evidence. Witnesses were also presented who testified that they had seen her at various times with Edwards when he was purchasing some of items that were ultimately found with Small's body. Other witnesses reported that they had observed her at various related locations during the course of the kidnaping and ransom calls. Lastly, the State submitted evidence that Edwards had used their garage to build the box in which Small's body was found. The jury found Rish guilty on both counts, and the trial court sentenced her to a term of natural life imprisonment and a concurrent 30-year term.THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. NANCY RISH, Defendant-Appellant. Ryan commutation On January 11, 2003, Illinois Governor George Ryan, a native of Kankakee, commuted all death row sentences in Illinois to life imprisonment. This act commuted the sentence of Danny Edwards who had murdered Ryan's next- door-neighbor Stephen Small. This is what Ryan had to say about the Small case at the time of the commutation: \\"I grew up in Kankakee which even today is still a small midwestern town, a place where people tend to know each other. Steve Small was a neighbor. I watched him grow up. He would babysit my young children ‚Äì which was not for the faint of heart since Lura Lynn and I had six children, five of them under the age of 3. He was a bright young man who helped run the family business. He got married and he and his wife had three children of their own. Lura Lynn was especially close to him and his family. We took comfort in knowing he was there for us and we for him. One September midnight he received a call at his home. There had been a break-in at the nearby house he was renovating. But as he left his house, he was seized at gunpoint by kidnappers. His captors buried him alive in a shallow hole. He suffocated to death before police could find him. His killer led investigators to where Steve's body was buried. The killer, Danny Edwards, was also from my hometown. He now sits on death row. I also know his family. I share this story with you so that you know I do not come to this as a neophyte without having experienced a small bit of the bitter pill the survivors of murder must swallow. My responsibilities and obligations are more than my neighbors and my family. I represent all the people of Illinois ‚Äì like it or not. The decision I make about our criminal justice system is felt not only here, but the world over.\\" I will not stand for it.

It is colloquially named Gm√ºesbrugg (Swiss German for \\"vegetable bridge\\"), and is a popular public square connecting Limmatquai, and the Weinplatz plaza and the historical Schipfe quarter. Wooden medieval bridge between Schipfe and Weinplatz and the present Limmatquai, Altarbilder by Hans Leu d.√Ñ., 1498 Quaibr√ºcke, M√ºnsterbr√ºcke and Rathausbr√ºcke on an aerial photograph by Eduard Spelterini, c. 1895 Weinplatz and Rathausbr√ºcke as seen from Limmatquai Rathaus Bridge and Schipfe as seen from Limmatquai upstream the Limmat Kantonspolizei Z√ºrich (police station) and adjacent caf√©  Geography  Rathausbr√ºcke is situated in the historical center of Z√ºrich, previously known as Celtic-Roman Turicum, on the southeastern foothill of the Lindenhof, near the Lindenhof‚ÄìWeinplatz‚ÄìM√ºnsterhof area on the eastern bank of the Limmat. Today, the bridge is used as a public square and pedestrian bridge connecting the Lindenhof Schipfe quarter and the Rathaus quarter.  Transportation  Although Rathausbr√ºcke is a historically important bridge in Z√ºrich, it is not a nodal point of the present tram railways. Neither the road traffic between General-Guisan-Quai and Limmatquai, nor the traffic from R√§mistrasse and Utoquai, use the Rathausbr√ºcke as a primary thoroughfare. The Z√ºrich tram lines 2, 4, and 15, as well as the Z√ºrichsee- Schifffahrtsgesellschaft provide public transportation. Individual transportation usually is limited to commercial traffic. The area is a pedestrian zone, hence, vehicle traffic is limited between lower Limmatquai and the Bellevueplatz square upstream.  Architecture  The first extensions of the medieval wooden bridge were carried out in 1375 and 1420/21. The medieval bridge was wider than necessary, and housed the mills of the Oetenbach Nunnery, as shown by the altarpiece of the Grossm√ºnster Zw√∂lfbotenkapelle by Hans Leu. Only the breakwaters at the inflow side were built of stone, which can be seen on the Murerplan. All other sections of the bridge consisted mostly of wood. As Schipfe expanded, it became necessary to expand the bridge to accommodate the new traffic. From 1602 to 1605 the bridge was rebuilt with the present dimensions. the bridge was bound on the east by the former Hotel Zum Schwert (now a commercial building), and in the west with a wooden platform made of oak planks. The bridge section between the town hall and the Hauptwache was rebuilt from stone. From 1881 to 1893, the remaining wooden bridge was replaced by a cast-iron construction. The old stalls and shops were slowly replaced by modern commercial buildings, including a caf√© and sanitary installations. In 1972, it once again became necessary to rebuild the bridge. The new design, made of reinforced concrete, was designed by the architect Manuel Pauli and completed in 1973.  History  The bridge is commonly known as Gm√ºesbrugg, Swiss German for \\"vegetable bridge.\\" It received its name after the medieval market on the bridge. However, the first bridge at that location may have been built in the Roman era. In medieval times it was named Untere Br√ºcke, or \\"lower bridge,\\" as opposed to the M√ºnsterbr√ºcke Limmat crossing called the \\"upper bridge.\\" It was later it was renamed after the town hall, rathaus that was built between 1692 and 1698.  Points of interest  Today the plaza serves as a public square, and is a pedestrian zone. Rathausbr√ºcke also serves as the setting for numerous local festivals and public events. At the site of the former Rother Turm the Hotel zum Storchen was built. Opposite of the building, the former seat of the medieval M√ºlner family is located, the Haus zum Schwert, named after the sword holder on the banner of the Z√ºrich.  Weinplatz  The square in front of the lower bridge, thereafter the old Kornhausplatz was used as a grain and vegetable store in medieval times, and became in 1630 the public market for local wines, the present Weinplatz square. Despite the relocation of the market to the M√ºnsterhof plaza in 1647, the name is still the same. Some medieval sources mention the Rother Turm building, meaning the \\"red tower\\" which was used by the House of Rapperswil as its seat in Z√ºrich in the early 13th century; much later it became a 'literature caf√©' and was demolished.

Nelson and published by the University of Wisconsin Press in 2001. The title is not a complete biography but draws from five archives to show Meiklejohn through his own words. A popular figure in the early 20th century who has since faded, Meiklejohn was a philosopher and university president who championed unified knowledge, idealism, and Great Books curricula. The book is split into five sections based on the locations in which Meiklejohn lived: his undergrad, faculty, and administrative years at Brown University, his presidency of Amherst College, his time with the University of Wisconsin Experimental College, and his experience with adult education and free speech advocacy at Berkeley. Nelson portrays Meiklejohn as \\"contradictory, paradoxical, and quixotic\\" as he grapples with how to encourage students to pursue freedom and how a teacher can teach this while respecting student freedom. Reviewers noted the clarity of Nelson's intellectual contextualization of Meiklejohn's work, but wanted additional information about what Meiklejohn thought about comparable programs, educational precedents, and luminaries in the field. Other reviewers marked the book's balance, completeness, and importance in resurfacing Meiklejohn as a major figure in the history of American education.  Publication  Education and Democracy: The Meaning of Alexander Meiklejohn, 1872‚Äì1964 is a biography of Alexander Meiklejohn written by Adam R. Nelson and published by the University of Wisconsin Press in 2001. In lieu of writing a definitive account of Meiklejohn's life, Nelson portrayed Meiklejohn through the subject's own language to let him \\"speak for himself\\". Nelson draws on five archives detailed in copious quotations and a 65-page notes and annotated bibliography appendix. While Meiklejohn was popular in the early 20th century and best known for his stance on academic freedom, he had become a marginal figure by the time this book was published. The book was the first full biography written on Meiklejohn, preceded only by dissertations and a 1981 \\"short 'biographical study that introduced Meiklejohn's written work. Nelson's title is a response to John Dewey's Democracy and Education. It intends to show the contrast of Meiklejohn's idealism opposite Dewey's pragmatism.  Summary  The work is split into five parts based on the places in which Meiklejohn lived: his undergraduate education at Brown University, his later administrative work there, his presidency of Amherst College, his University of Wisconsin Experimental College, and his work with adult education and other actions in Berkeley. At the core of Meiklejohn's effort to create systems that promote democratic citizenship, Nelson argues, is \\"the paradox of Socratic teaching\\": how a teacher can make a student want freedom and how a teacher can teach this while respecting the student's freedom in practice. Meiklejohn in 1928 Meiklejohn was born in Great Britain and raised in Rhode Island. He attended Brown and Cornell University, and later returned to the former as a popular ethics professor and its consequent dean of admissions. In place of the popular elective system and science curriculum, he championed a Kantian style of education with unified knowledge, moral development, and pursuit of ideals, and a style of democratic governance where students would lead and reason through their own education. Meiklejohn saw democracy as something imparted and reconsidered by passing generations, and that it was borne in \\"strong discussions around agreed terms\\". His suggested curriculum for a unified knowledge included one or two years of ancient Greek classics and added years of enlightenment or modern American classics. Meiklejohn became Amherst College's president in 1912. Meiklejohn developed a legacy of autocratic treatment of faculty, drastic overspending, and that of a college hermetically detached from demands of the outside world. He was ousted after lying about faculty appointments, whereupon he opened the Experimental College at the University of Wisconsin, a two-year Great Books program with readings from ancient Greece and modern America. There, too, he treated the program as unaccountable to outside influence, and did not produce reports of their work or build rapport with the outside Wisconsin community. The program quickly closed for reasons attributed to Meiklejohn's obstinance and not programmatic design. Meiklejohn then opened a Great Books adult education program in San Francisco where students similarly self-governed and led their own education. As funding dissipated at the outset of World War II, the students chose to shutter the school before \\"compromising\\" their ideals. Meiklejohn became an advocate of free speech as an absolute right differentiated from physical action. His stances on this and democracy influenced the United States Supreme Court and the aims of UNESCO. Nelson portrays Meiklejohn as \\"contradictory, paradoxical, and quixotic\\". Despite believing in free thought and the primacy of student choice in determining their own education, he held incontrovertible stances. Nelson compares Meiklejohn to fellow educator Woodrow Wilson: \\"idealists who occasionally allowed the enthusiasm of their vision to impede the integrity of their leadership\\". Meiklejohn's students often defied his wishes, overturning a ban of professional baseball student players at Brown, enlisting in the army at Amherst, and choosing anarchy over student government at Wisconsin. Meiklejohn was an idealist who shunned the pragmatism of figures like John Dewey. Meiklejohn's idealism required charismatic and \\"demanding\\" tutors for any student who agreed to the minimum of open-minded participation in seminar.  Reception  The biography is considered the first on Meiklejohn. Reviewers noted the clarity of Nelson's intellectual contextualization of Meiklejohn's work, but wanted additional information about what Meiklejohn thought about comparable programs, educational precedents, and luminaries in the field. Other reviewers marked the book's balance, completeness, and importance in resurfacing Meiklejohn as a major figure in the history of American education. Dominique Marshall (Labour/Le Travail) compared Nelson's clear presentation of Meiklejohn's philosophy to Meiklejohn's own accessible practice of philosophy. Marshall described Nelson's intellectual and political contextualization surrounding the eras of Meiklejohn's life as having \\"surprising variety\\". Mary Ann Dzuback (The Journal of American History) thought that the book was not riveting, as par for the genre, but that the work was \\"thoughtful and compelling\\". She affirmed Meiklejohn's importance for his experiments and attempts to make educational programs capable of producing a democratic society. Dzuback praised Nelson's use of student quotes and his analysis of Meiklejohn's written work, but wanted for more context, such as how Meiklejohn compared with other educational figures in higher education, how other contemporary Great Books programs impacted his thought, and where he stood in the overall history of American education. Marshall too remained curious about Meiklejohn's views on the family's role in civic education. Jinting Wu (Education Review) complained of too much intellectual context in areas and of unresolved contradictions in Meiklejohn's metaphysical claims. Scot Guenter (American Studies) considered the biography \\"particularly timely\\" for the post-September 11 relevance of Meiklejohn's democratic experiments in the face of the privatization of higher education, and of Meiklejohn's courage towards free speech. He wrote that Meiklejohn's views on curriculum would arouse \\"needed\\" reflection in college instructors, and that the book's audience should include university administration and those interested in civil liberties as well as historians and philosophers of education. Guenter appreciated how Nelson presented the shortcomings of Meiklejohn's ego and spendthrift lifestyle. Robert Sherman, writing for the History of Education Quarterly and reflecting on the depth of the appendices, struggled to consider \\"how such a work could be more complete\\". He wrote through Louis Menand that Meiklejohn's \\"certitude [led] to violence\\" and that by letting him speak for himself, Nelson made the French philosopher Charles Renouvier's point that only individuals are certain and that there is no greater certainty. Guenter added that the biography read best in the parts where Nelson was clearly inspired by Meiklejohn's zeal and idealism, particularly the \\"What Does the First Amendment Mean?\\" chapter, which Guenter considered essential reading.

Alongside Robert Simonds, she was one of two original members of the global media company STX Entertainment, which owns and controls assets including a movie studio (STXfilms), television studio (STXtv), virtual reality studio (STXsurreal), and a digital content studio (STXdigital). The company is fully capitalized by private equity giant TPG Growth, Chinese private equity firm Hony Capital, Chinese streaming giant Tencent, Hong Kong-based information and communications technology company PCCW, the world's largest international cable company Liberty Global, and a number of high net-worth individuals including philanthropist and filmmaker Gigi Pritzker and businessman William Wrigley, Jr. II. Watts is notable for being the only female media executive in history to have built a Hollywood film studio from the ground up. Watts was President of STX Entertainment from inception (2011) until January 16, 2018, when she announced her resignation from the company, citing a desire to focus on aggressive new business and turnaround opportunities. During her 7-year tenure, STX Entertainment grew from inception into a media conglomerate which, based on preliminary paperwork for its planned initial public offering on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, valued the company at over US$2.5 billion. Watts remains a significant shareholder and strategic advisor to STX. Personal life Watts was born in London, England, the daughter of music video and music film producer Tessa Watts - one of the pioneers of the music video industry at Virgin Records - and rock journalist and newspaper editor Michael Watts. She has publicly protested the publication of her relationship to the prominent Whitney family, of which she is a direct heir, including to the New York Times, citing misrepresentation and security issues. She grew up in London and Bedfordshire and attended Gonville and Caius College at the University of Cambridge. She graduated with First-Class Honours (summa cum laude) in Economic History (Master's), and was awarded recognition as a Senior Scholar of her college, where she wrote a thesis on the economic rise and might of Asia, notably in China and India. She is in a relationship with American television producer and writer Allison Adler, who has two children with her former partner Sara Gilbert. Early career Early in her career, Watts worked in music film, videos and programming with artists including Sir Paul McCartney, Sir Elton John, U2, Beyonc√©, Madonna, and Mariah Carey. She moved to Los Angeles in 2007, where she was a producer and financier on film projects including the 2011 documentary Bully. The film was awarded the Producers Guild of America (PGA) Stanley Kramer award in 2013, honoring productions and individuals that ‚Äúilluminate and raise public awareness of important social issues.‚Äù By 2014, the film had been viewed by over 3.5 million secondary students across the United States. STX Entertainment Origins In 2011, Watts started working with Robert \\"Bob\\" Simonds as they began to build a next-generation film, television and multimedia company. The goal of the company was to ‚Äúmake, market and distribute star-driven, commercial\\" content. Incubated by the private equity firm TPG Growth, the company grew to secure investments from Chinese private equity firm Hony Capital, and others including philanthropist and filmmaker Gigi Pritzker and businessman William ‚ÄúBeau\\" Wrigley. In 2014, the company announced that it had secured over $1 billion in financing. Other core executives of the STX team included former Viacom Entertainment Chief Operating Officer Tom McGrath (media executive), who functions as the company's COO, and former Crest Animation CEO Noah Fogelson as General Counsel. STXfilms Rather than pursuing the traditional distribution process, STXfilms, the film studio division of STX Entertainment, secured direct distribution agreements with North American theater chains AMC, Regal, Cinemark, Goodrich, Marcus Theatres and Carmike Cinemas.\\"Robert Simonds, Gigi Pritzker Pact with TPG, China‚Äôs Hony Capital on Production Venture,\\" Variety, March 10, 2014. Later on in 2014, STXfilms hired a series of film and media executives, including former Universal Pictures Chairman Adam Fogelson and former Disney production and marketing chief Oren Aviv. In January 2015, STXfilms signed a multiyear television output agreement to release its films exclusively to Showtime Networks during the premium television window, beginning in 2015 and covering the studio‚Äôs theatrical releases through 2019.Dave McNary, \\"STX Entertainment, Showtime Announce TV Output Deal and First 4 Films,\\" Variety, January 20, 2015.

The studio subsequently closed a three-year film slate deal with Huayi Brothers, one of China's largest film companies, which will enable STX to co- produce and co-distribute 12 to 15 films annually. The studio announced that it would make at least 10 ‚Äúcommercial‚Äù movies a year and that it would function as a next-generation, fully integrated film studio. STXfilms projects include Bad Moms, Molly's Game, Jackie Chan-starrer The Foreigner, and The Gift. In 2016, STXfilms became the fastest studio that year to hit $100-million at the domestic box office with Bad Moms, earned a People's Choice award winner for best comedy for the film, garnered a Golden Globe nomination for Hailee Steinfeld in The Edge of Seventeen and procured DGA Best New Director nominations for The Gift and The Edge of Seventeen. In October 2017, STXfilms' The Foreigner, a co-production with Jackie Chan's Sparkle Roll Media, crossed $100 million in box office globally. The film was termed \\"a clear winner given that it cost just $35 million to produce\\" and \\"a fine example of how a Chinese co-production can work.\\"Nancy Tartaglione, \\"'The Foreigner's Wayne Marc Godfrey On Decade-Long Journey; STX/Sparkle Roll China Co-Pro Soon Passing $100M Offshore,\\" Deadline.com, October 27, 2017.Scott Mendelson, \\"Box Office: Jackie Chan's 'The Foreigner' Is Succeeding Where 'Warcraft' Failed,\\" Forbes, October 14, 2017.Patrick Brzeski, \\"China Box Office: 'Never Say Die' Becomes Biggest Single-Market Comedy Ever With $280M,\\" The Hollywood Reporter, October 15, 2017.

Four months later, STX Entertainment announced that it had closed its Series C of financing, led by investors including Hong Kong telecommunications company PCCW Ltd., which is controlled by Richard Li, and Tencent Holdings Ltd. As part of the funding, STX also received new investments from East West Bancorp‚Äôs Dominic Ng, as well as existing investors TPG, Hony Capital, business interests of Gigi Pritzker, Michael Pucker and their immediate family, and William Wrigley Jr. The deal valued STX at almost $1.5 billion. On announcement of the deal, the company announced that funds from this round of financing would be used to build its TV division, expand internationally and acquire digital media start-ups. In August 2016, Watts announced that she had acquired for STX the Virtual Reality creator and distributor Surreal, which was founded in 2015 and in its first year produced over 70 immersive VR experiences.Lucas Matney, \\"STX Entertainment acquires VR studio Surreal,\\" TechCrunch, August 23, 2016.

The show is set to air on NatGeo. IPO In September 2017, it was reported that STX may be close to an initial public offering on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (SEHK) starting in early 2018. While based in the US, the company has numerous corporate and business relationships with China, and it has been reported that a listing on the SEHK could make it easier for Chinese companies to invest in Hollywood films.

She was the abbess of Vadstena Abbey from 1403 until 1422. Life Gerdeka Hartlevsdotter was the daughter of Hartlev Bolk (d.1390) and Ingeborg (d. 1400) from Sk√§nninge. Her mother became a member of Vadstena Abbey as a widow. Gerdeka, when abbess, had her father reburied in the abbey graveyard when it became permitted for non-members of the order to be buried there. Gerdeka was elected abbess in 1403 after the deposition of her predecessor Ingegerd Knutsdotter. Her reign has been described as a golden age for the abbey. In 1406, she received a delegation from England headed by Henry FitzHugh, 3rd Baron FitzHugh, for the purpose of creating a daughter abbey of the Bridgettine order in England. In 1415, she completed the negotiations, and at the wish of the English King sent the nuns Anna Karlsdotter, Christina Finwitsdotter, Christina Esbj√∂rnsdotter and Anna Esbj√∂rnsdotter to England with great festivities, escorted by all the bishops of Sweden, the archbishop and a bishop from Norway, as well as several ambassadors, to found Syon Abbey in England. In 1419, Vadstena was subjected to an investigation after rumors that not only the abbess Gerdica but also the nuns had received male guests in private and accepted gifts from them.Frans Oscar V√•gman: Vreta Kloster.

Boccia's work consisted mostly of large scale paintings in Neo-Expressionist style, and reflect an interest in religion and its role in the modern world. His primary format was the multi-panel painting. Widely exhibited during his lifetime, and the focus of a number of retrospective and solo exhibits, the artist created over 1,500 paintings, and over fifty large scale multi-panel format oil paintings in a neo-expressionist style, such as Mystique Marriage (1979).Archives of The Edward E.

In 1951, he was appointed Assistant Dean of Fine Arts at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, where he taught painting for over 30 years, until his retirement in 1986.

They also captured the Mittledeutscher Pokal (Central German Cup) in 1931. These victories qualified the team for the national playoffs where their furthest advance was to the semi-finals in 1912 and again in 1924.Gr√ºne, Hardy (1996). Vom Kronprinzen bis zur Bundesliga. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag In 1933, German football was reorganized under the Third Reich into 16 top-flight regional circuits. SpVgg played a single season in the Gauliga Sachsen in 1937‚Äì38. In January 1944, they played alongside TuRa Leipzig to form the wartime side Kriegspielgemeinschaft Leipzig. The 1944‚Äì45 season ended prematurely as World War II overtook the country and the team was lost at war's end. Organizations throughout the country, including sports and football clubs, were disbanded after the conflict as part of the process of denazification. New clubs soon emerged from the remnants of the pre-war associations and former SpVgg members established SG Lindenau-Hafen. In early 1949, SG and a number of other clubs including SG Leutzsch (out of the former membership of TuRa), SG Lindenau-Aue, SG Leipzig-Mitte, and SG B√∂hlitz- Ehrenberg were merged to create Zentrale Sportgemeinschaft Industrie Leipzig. The club was active in lower tier competition in Soviet-occupied East Germany under several different names; ZSG Industrie Hafen-Leipzig (1949), SG Hafen Leipzig-Lindenau (1950), BSG Stahl Hafen Leipzig (1951), and later, as BSG Fortschritt West Leipzig, but was never able to win its way to higher level competition.

High school career Chapman attended Oak Grove High School in San Jose, California, where he played football and basketball. He earned All-BVAL first-team honors in 2007 and 2008, and was the 2008 Most Valuable DB. As a senior, he recorded 34 tackles, 3 interceptions, 4 passes defended and a forced fumble. He also rushed for 332 yards and 8 touchdowns. College career Community college Chapman was not offered any scholarships after graduating from high school, so he decided to stay close to home and play for the City College of San Francisco Rams. In his two years with the Rams, he compiled 39 tackles, 10 interceptions, 2 fumble recoveries, 2 touchdowns and a sack. With the help of future Wildcats teammate Nigel Malone, he led his team to a 12-1 record in 2010, as well as the school's 11th NorCal Championship. They eventually lost in the state championship to Mt. San Antonio College. Chapman was drawing interest from several NCAA Division I schools. He was now considered a three-star prospect by Rivals.comRivals profile and received interest from a dozen D-I schools. He accepted a scholarship from Kansas State over other offers from New Mexico, New Mexico State, and Tulsa in order to play for head coach Bill Snyder. Kansas State As a junior in 2011, he registered 50 tackles, 5 passes defended, a forced fumble and an interception. He returned that interception 60 yards for a touchdown on November 5 against #3 Oklahoma State, but they went on to lose 52-45. His playing time increased as a senior in 2012, and he recorded career highs in tackles (57), interceptions (5) and passes defended (10). On a November 3 game, also against Oklahoma State, he intercepted quarterback Clint Chelf three times, including one for a touchdown. He earned FBS Defensive Player of the Week and Big 12 Defensive Player of the Week honors for his performance. Professional career Indianapolis Colts After going undrafted in the 2013 NFL draft, the Indianapolis Colts signed him as an undrafted free agent to a rookie contract on May 12, 2013. Coincidentally, the Colts released Nigel Malone (who played with Chapman at CC of San Francisco and Kansas State) in order to make space for the rookie cornerback. However, the Colts released Chapman on August 25 as part of the final roster cuts to trim the roster down to 78 players. Arizona Rattlers On November 1, 2013, Chapman (and two other rookies) were assigned to the Arizona Rattlers of the Arena Football League. He played his first game on April 26, 2014 against the San Antonio Talons, where his 4 combined tackles contributed to a 69-59 victory. His first career interception came a few weeks later, when he intercepted a pass by Danny Southwick with 50 seconds left and returned it 21 yards for a touchdown, which clinched a 70-59 victory against the Portland Thunder on a June 6 showdown. New Orleans VooDoo On March 23, 2015, Chapman was traded to the New Orleans VooDoo, along with Rayshaun Kizer, in exchange for future considerations. Portland Thunder On March 30, 2015, Chapman was traded to the Portland Thunder for claim order positioning. On July 8, 2015, Chapman was placed on reassignment. Arizona Rattlers On November 9, 2015, Chapman was assigned to the Arizona Rattlers. On January 19, 2017, Chapman signed with the Rattlers. Chapman was named First Team All- Indoor Football League in 2017. On July 8, the Rattlers defeated the Sioux Falls Storm in the United Bowl by a score of 50‚Äì41. He re-signed with the Rattlers on September 12, 2017. Tampa Bay Storm On July 31, 2017, Chapman was assigned to the Tampa Bay Storm. The Storm folded in December 2017.

It had its world premiere on February 26, 2015 at The Playboy Mansion and received a limited theatrical release on March 13 of the same year, followed by a video on demand release on March 17. It stars Lachlan Buchanan, Playboy Playmate of the Year 2012 Jaclyn Swedberg, Stephanie Danielson, YouTube star Lauren Francesca, and Kane Hodder. Funding for Muck was partially raised through a successful Kickstarter campaign that raised $266,325. Muck is the first film in a trilogy and will be followed by Muck: Chapter 1, which will serve as a prequel to the events in the 2015 film. Plot After narrowly escaping from an ancient burial ground, long forgotten and buried underneath the marshes of Cape Cod, a group of friends emerge from the thick, marshy darkness, tattered and bloody, lucky to be alive. They have already lost two of their friends in the marsh, presumably dead. They stumble upon an empty Cape Cod vacation house alongside the foggy marsh and break in to take shelter. Whatever was in the marsh is still after them and, soon after one of them goes for help, the rest of the group learns that the evil in the marsh is not the only thing that wants them dead. Something worse, something more savage, is lying in wait just outside the marsh, in the house. The unlucky travelers spend their St. Patrick's Day trapped between two evils, forcing them to fight, die, or go back the way they came.

The original score was composed by Dan Marschak and Miles Senzaki. Reception The blatant sexuality of Muck polarized audiences and critics, but the film nevertheless received major distribution. As one reviewer put it, ‚Äúagainst all odds‚Äù Anchor Bay Entertainment distributed the film. The independent horror film was highly anticipated and widely reviewed, including by reviewers at the Los Angeles Times, The Village Voice, Bloody Disgusting, and The Fright File. While critics generally agreed that the overt sexuality of the film was an attempt for Muck to be \\"a throwback to old-school horror,\\" reviews were mixed, as some critics found Muck‚Äôs focus on sex distracting but praised the movie's look and camerawork. Others saw the film‚Äôs scantily-clad characters as an attraction. Ain't It Cool News wrote \\"About as subtle as a stripper in church, don‚Äôt expect your brain to be stimulated, but other areas (specifically your guts and below) are bound to be rumbled when you wade through MUCK.\\" On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 0% approval based on 7 reviews.

She is of NgƒÅpuhi, Te Hikitu, Irish, Scottish and English (Yorkshire) descent. Lander is a well-respected and significant MƒÅori artist who since 1986 has exhibited, photographed, written and taught MƒÅori art. She continues to produce and exhibit work as well as attend residencies and symposia both nationally and internationally. Education Lander began learning weaving with noted MƒÅori weaver Diggeress Te Kanawa in 1984 and spent many years researching fibre arts. In 2002 she was the first person of MƒÅori descent to gain a Doctorate in Fine Arts at a New Zealand university. *1963 Wellington Teachers College *1987 Bachelor of Fine Arts (Photography) Elam School of Fine Arts, University of Auckland. *1989 Bachelor of Arts in MƒÅori Studies, University of Auckland. *1993 Masters of Fine Arts (Sculpture), First Class Honours, Elam School of Fine Arts, University of Auckland. *2002 Doctor of Fine Arts, Elam School of Fine Arts, University of Auckland Career as an educator Lander worked as a teacher before attending Elam School of Fine Arts. From 1986 she worked as a photographer for the University of Auckland's Department of Anthropology. She taught MƒÅori fibre arts over many years, mainly in the MƒÅori Studies Department at the University of Auckland where she was a Senior Lecturer in MƒÅori Material Culture. In 2007 she retired from university lecturing. Work Lander was first introduced to muka (flax fibre) by noted weaver Diggeress Te Kanawa in 1984, when she went to stay several times with the senior artist at Ohaki Maori village, near Waitomo and learned the basics of preparing materials and techniques such as whatu (finger twining). Her end of year installation at Elam, titled Te Kohanga Harakeke ('The Flax Nest') included a structure covered in milled flax in the shape of a massive inverted nest, which sheltered a young harakeke (flax) plant. Lander's first public art exhibition was as part of the group exhibition Karanga Karanga at the Fisher Gallery (now Te Tuhi Centre for the Arts, Pakuranga, Auckland) in 1986. She describes her three decades working with muka as a 'journey of discovery'. In a recent artist statement Lander said: > I was seduced by the beauty and magic of muka. My first public installation > in 1986 ‚Äì E kore koe e ngaro he kakano i ruia mai i Rangiatea in the > Karanga, Karanga exhibition ‚Äì featured whenu (warp threads) and aho (weft > threads) that I had carefully prepared to make my first korowai. Instead, I > suspended them in an ethereal cloud-like formation over a swirl of flax > seed. In 1998 art historian Priscilla Pitts wrote that Lander's combination of 'conventional university art school' study and training with traditional MƒÅori weavers was reflected in her work: > Though much of her work is a response to weaving arts, Lander seldom > actually weaves - at least, in the works she exhibits in gallery spaces. > Rather, she uses, often to astonishing effect, the materials used in > traditional Maori weaving and dying. These include pingao and feathers, but > most of all harakeke (New Zealand flax) in all its forms - its leaves, its > handsome flower and seed heads, the seeds and muka (the fine silky fibre > obtained from the leaves). With these she combines materials from the > Western world. Pitts gives Lander's 1994 work This is not a kete, made for the exhibition Art Now at the former Museum of New Zealand (now the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa) as an example of the way her work combines traditional MƒÅori crafts and Western sculptural or installation practices. Lander's work plays on Rene Magritte's famous painting Ceci n'est pas une pipe with a woven kete (flax basket) placed on top of a plinth with the words 'This is not a kete' inscribed on it. More kete were arranged on the floor of the gallery and dramatically lit. Pitts writes > 'Here, in the context of the art exhibition, 'practical' objects - simple > woven flax bags - are elevated to the status of art objects. ... However, > this particular art exhibition was located in what was also an ethnography > and history museum, within which the collection, cataloguing, and display of > things like kete divorces them from their cultural, spiritual and/or > utilitarian contexts and transforms them into artefacts. In 2006 Lander was one of fifteen New Zealand artists, most of MƒÅori and Pacific Island descent, who were invited to take part in the Pasifika Styles exhibition by making site-specific works throughout the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge that responded to objects in the museum's collection. For the exhibition Lander reworked two previous commissions, This is not a kete and pieces from Mrs Cook's kete, a 2002 collaboration with Christine Hellyar at the Pitt Rivers Museum at Oxford University. Lander also made new pieces, including the site-specific installations Airy-Theory Artefacts (woven objects suspended in front of a screened window) and Tane Raises His Eyebrows (a crescent-shaped weaving placed over a decorative wooden door lintel). She also made a piece titled Crown Grab Bag for the exhibition, a large woven crown placed on a royal purple silk pillow with gold tassels. In the publication accompanying the exhibition, Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology curator Anita Herle wrote > The work references the New Zealand Foreshore and Seabed Act of 2004, which > empowered the New Zealand government, 'the Crown', to override tribal rights > to pursue customary claims to the foreshore and seabed through the courts. > Lander's crown is delicately woven from a variety of fibres, including plant > materials that grow along the foreshore - the creation of the crown itself > is thus a subtle but defiant act of re-appropriation. Shells and fishing > hooks from the museum's collection are placed on the base of the case. > Strands of pingao fibre, stitched into the fabric lining at the back of the > case, form inverted U-shapes representing the raised eyebrows of Tane (god > of the forest). According to MƒÅori legend, following a dispute between Tane > and Tangaroa (god of the sea) Tane's eyebrows were flung onto the sand > dunes, which mark the liminal space between the forest and the sea. Here > Lander connects contemporary political conflicts to legendary battles. Responding to objects and taonga held in cultural institutions' collections remains a strong feature of Lander's work. In a 2015 exhibition at the National Library of New Zealand (a collaboration with Christine Hellyar and Jo Torr) Lander made a number of works relating to works in the library's art and archival collections. Her piece Hariata‚Äôs War Garb is inspired by Joseph Merrett's 1846 watercolour The Warrior Chieftains of New Zealand. The portrait depicts Hone Heke, the chief Kawiti, and Heke's wife Hariata. Hariata is shown wearing a woven sash unlike anything Lander had seen before. Researching her own family history, Lander found descriptions of Hariata written by her great- great grandfather James Johnston Fergusson. One document describes Hariata leading 700 men; another as being ‚Äòyoung, tall, and rather goodlooking‚Äô, wearing ‚Äòa tartan dress with red sash slung around her shoulders like a shepherd‚Äôs plaid‚Äô. Lander recreated the sash for the exhibition, along with a number of other pieces. In a review of the exhibition art historian Jill Trevelyan noted that Lander drew on her own experience learning weaving under Diggeress Te Kanawa to produce the works Rongo's samplers, a reimagining of the first works produced by a new practitioner. Selected exhibitions Lander began exhibiting her artwork in 1986. Having exhibited both nationally and internationally, Lander currently enjoys exhibiting with other artists in the small communities around the Hokianga where her ancestors lived. *2018 Hariata‚Äôs War Garb (part of The NgƒÅpuhi Festival), Northcote College, Auckland *2017 Flat-Pack Whakapapa, The Dowse Art Museum and touring throughout 2018; The Delicate Balance of Wobbling Stars, Corban Estate Art Centre * 2015 Te WƒÅ T≈çiri: Fluid Horizons, Auckland Art Gallery: an exhibition from the collections of the gallery including Lander's major installation work Hou Angiangi (2003).

Work A Dutch Merchant Vessel in Choppy Waters near a Rocky Coast, Whales Nearby Castro was active in Antwerp as a marine painter. The few works by his hand that are currently known cover the range of subjects typical for marine painters in the 17th century such as sailing ships, port scenes and naval battles. These works show an influence by the Dutch development towards tonal painting while retaining typically Flemish stylistic elements. This is demonstrated in the Spanish Ships at Anchor (National Maritime Museum, Greenwich) which through the tonality of its colour scheme, low horizon and build-up of clouds in the background reveals a Dutch influence while its more theatrical lighting and schematic depiction of the ships show a typically 'Flemish' style.Sebastian Castro, \\"Spanish Ships at Anchor\\" at the National Maritime Museum His Harbour Scene, Spanish Ships Approaching a Jetty (National Maritime Museum, Greenwich) again show a tonality of colour and low perspective.

Copyright Office, p2473 Plot summary AXE sends Carter to investigate Rhodesian sanction- busting exports of gold to China and an organization of assassins possibly led by Carter‚Äôs arch-enemy, Judas (Martin Bormann). Carter goes undercover as tour guide Andrew Grant, taking a dozen female college students on a 30-day tour of Rhodesia. The tour is led by Gus Boyd. At the airport prior to departure Carter sees a man surreptitiously give tour group member, Booty Delong, a small package. Upon arrival in Rhodesia, Carter and Boyd approach shady businessman Alan Wilson to discuss setting up a gold smuggling operation between Rhodesia and India in the hope it will draw out Judas' smuggling contacts. Wilson has no need for new contacts and warns Carter to stay away from THB (Taylor Hill-Boreman), a Rhodesian gold mining company, which Carter suggested he might contact. Wilson secretly photographs Carter and sends the pictures to Mike Bor (Martin Bormann) chairman of THB who recognizes Carter as his old enemy. Carter follows Booty DeLong when she refuses to join the tour for the day. She heads to a farm in the Rhodesian countryside where she meets up again with the man at the airport. Carter observes her return the package to him. The package contains cash to support rebels fighting the Rhodesian army. The farm owner, Pieter van Prez, intends to detain Carter overnight. Carter releases a canister of knockout gas and escapes. Carter visits the Rhodesia Railways office in Salisbury posing as a railway journalist. He probes about freight movements to and from the THB mine. He is followed from the railway office by Stash Foster, an assassin sent by Judas. Carter kills Stash in a vicious knife fight. Carter flies to Wankie National Park and rejoins the tour group. On an afternoon safari his bus is attacked by Judas's men posing as park workers. After a prolonged chase across the park, Carter and the tour group meet Ross ‚Äì a rebel leader. Carter and Ross team up to devise a strategy to enter the vast THB mining enclosure and gather evidence. Carter sets out alone. When Ross returns to their base camp to escort the female tourists back to the main camp he finds they have been captured by THB scouts. Carter readily discovers the extent of the gold smuggling activities of THB. He manages to get a message to his contact at the railway company to inform the Rhodesian police. Carter targets Judas at a villa inside the THB compound. The captured female tourists are also held there. Carter crashes a truck into the heavily defended villa. In the confusion Judas escapes. Ross and the Rhodesian police arrive in support. Carter sticks to his cover story and allows the police to take credit for the exposure of THB‚Äôs illegal activities. Carter completes the rest of the tour in the company of the young women.

Built by Sir Jacob Elias Sassoon in memory of his wife Rachel, it was completed in 1920 and consecrated in 1921. Ohel Rachel is the largest synagogue in the Far East, and one of the only two still standing in Shanghai. Repurposed first under the Japanese occupation during World War II and again following the Communist conquest of Shanghai in 1949, the synagogue has been a protected architectural landmark of the city since 1994. It was reopened for some Jewish holidays from 1999 and briefly held more regular Shabbat services as part of the 2010 Shanghai Expo. History Construction The Ohel Rachel Synagogue was constructed by Sirs Jacob Elias and Edward Elias Sassoon of the wealthy Sassoon family of Baghdadi- Jewish origin, who built many of Shanghai's historic structures. It replaced its predecessor, the Beth El Synagogue, which was established in 1887, and was designed by the Shanghai firm of Robert Bradshaw Moorhead and Sidney Joseph Halse. \\"Moorhead & Halse\\", gives a brief pr√©cis of the firm's history to that date. It was built on Seymour Road (now North Shaanxi Road), in the western section of the Shanghai International Settlement. The building was opened in March 1920 and consecrated by the recently arrived Rabbi W. Hirsch, the first rabbi of the Shanghai Sephardim community, on 23 January 1921. The synagogue was named after Jacob Sassoon's late wife, Rachel, but, as he also died shortly before its dedication, it was dedicated to the couple together. It was also colloquially known as the Seymour Synagogue from its former address. Ohel Rachel was the first purpose-built synagogue in Shanghai. Built as a scaled-up neo-BaroqueThough termed Greek Revival in Bracken 2010:139‚Äì140 pavilion entered through an Ionic portico recessed between massive rusticated piers in antis, its interior arrangement and the use of round-headed windows on its sides were patterned after the Bevis Marks and Lauderdale Road Synagogues in London. Ohel Rachel's cavernous sanctuary, overlooked by a second floor with wide balconies, has a capacity of 700 people. Its walk-in ark, which held 30 Torah scrolls, was flanked by marble pillars. The facility also included a library, ritual bath (mikveh), and playground. Ohel Rachel is the largest synagogue in the Far East and is described as \\"second to none in the East\\". Republic of China The Jewish Club Ahduth opened in the Ohel Rachel compound in 1921. It held both Sephardi and Ashkenazi social events, though the former tended to dominate. After combat between Chinese and Japanese forces in the 1932 Shanghai Incident caused serious damage to the Hongkou District where Ashkenazi settlement was concentrated, the congregation of Ohel Moshe opened a new branch of their synagogue in a building next to Ohel Rachel. The Shanghai Jewish School also moved in 1932 from Dixwell Road in Hongkou to a building adjacent to Ohel Rachel. The school served both Ashkenazi and Sephardi students. During the Second World War, the foreign concessions‚Äîincluding the area around Ohel Rachel‚Äîcontinued under international control even after the Japanese victory in the 1937 Battle of Shanghai. Shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, however, Japan invaded and occupied the remaining settlements in Shanghai. The act cut off American funds to the city's Jewish community, swollen with thousands of recent refugees from Europe. The Japanese imposed restrictions on the Jews of Shanghai and, in 1943, required most of them to move to the Restricted Sector for Stateless Refugees, the Shanghai Ghetto. This was located in Hongkou, well away from Ohel Rachel, which was converted into a stable. People's Republic of China A wedding ceremony held at the Ohel Rachel in January 1951 The Communist Party of China took Shanghai near the close of the Chinese Civil War, a few months before the establishment of the People's Republic of China in October 1949. They permitted Shanghai's Jewish community to continue using Ohel Rachel until 1952, when the property was seized and stripped of its furnishings. It was then included in the compound for the Shanghai Education Commission. Almost all of the city's Jews had emigrated by 1956. During the Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s, the building was used as a warehouse and suffered some damage, with its windows and chandeliers smashed. As part of the thaw in Sino-American relations in the late 1990s, Chinese Communist Party general secreatry Jiang Zemin invited three American religious leaders selected by the American President Bill Clinton to visit China in February 1998. One of them, Rabbi Arthur Schneier, extracted a promise from Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi to protect Ohel Rachel, restore it, and open it to the public. The Municipality of Shanghai allocated to restore the synagogue under the direction of its former caretaker (and later Israeli resident) Aha Toeug. It was cleaned and repainted, although structural damage was not repaired. Hillary Clinton (in white) and Secretary of State (in black, at right) touring Ohel Rachel in July 1998 A few months later, during President Clinton's state visit to China, his wife Hillary and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited the synagogue. Rabbi Schneier resanctified Ohel Rachel for the occasion using a Torah brought from New York City, which he then donated to the local Jewish community. In September 1999, a Rosh Hashanah service was held at the synagogue for the first time since 1952. The same year, the synagogue was separately visited by Israeli President Ezer Weizmann and by German Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der. The areas of the building refurbished for these visits were then used as a lecture hall, although Jews were permitted to observe holidays such as Purim, Passover, Rosh Hashanah, and Hanukkah on site. Ohel Rachel Synagogue in 2013 As part of the 2010 Shanghai Expo, Ohel Rachel Synagogue was reopened for regular Shabbat services as well, despite Judaism continuing to be an unrecognized religion in China. The site--still part of the grounds of the Shanghai Ministry of Education--was open by reservation for services on Friday evenings and Saturday mornings, while weekday observances were held elsewhere. By 2013, however, Ohel Rachel was again only available for major holidays, prompting protest from the visiting House majority leader Eric Cantor (R-VA), at the time the highest-ranking elected Jewish official in American history. Conservation Ohel Rachel and Ohel Moshe are the only two synagogues of old Shanghai that still stand, out of the original six. On 18 March 1994, the Shanghai municipal government declared the Ohel Rachel Synagogue a protected architectural landmark of the city, but it continued to be used as an office and storage space until 1998. The synagogue was included on the 2002 World Monuments Watch List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites in order to provide assistance to the local Jewish community's efforts to address Ohel Rachel's structural problems, including invasive vegetation and a leaking roof, and to restore it to its 1920 appearance. The fund's Jewish Heritage Program provided a grant to assist with documenting the site and establishing a long-term management plan. It was included on the 2004 list as well, although mostly to \\"maintain awareness\\" of the project.

Work Francois-Charles Joullain was the author of three works which serve the historian of the art market as a guide to auction house practices in the 18th century: his R√©pertoire de tableaux, dessins et estampes, ouvrage utile aux amateurs, 1783, his Variation de prix concernant les tableaux, 1786, and above all his Reflexions sur la peinture et la gravure, accompagn√©es d'une courte dissertation sur le commerce de la curiosit√© et les ventes en g√©n√©ral, Metz, 1786.on-line text. Joullain was a pioneer of the way that paintings were valued with his R√©pertoire de tableaux: dessins et estampes, ouvrage utile aux amateurs (1783); a work in which he recorded the prices and provenances of major paintings sold in the previous decade. McAllister, W.J., \\"Paintings, Provenance and Price: Speculations on 18th-Century Connoissuership in France,\\" Gazette de Beaux- Artes, Vol. 107, 1987, pp 191-99 In this regard, Joullain built on the earlier work of Edm√©-Fran√ßois Gersaint (1694‚Äì1750) who was the first French art dealer to introduce detailed Catalogs with descriptions of the work and biographies of the artist. Etro, F.and Stepanova, E., \\"The Market for Paintings in Paris between Rococo and Tomanticism,\\" Kyklos, Vol. 68, no.1, 2015, pp. 28-50 Joullain's contribution was to compile the first index that documented provenance and the prices paintings had fetched at auctions. He followed up with a more detailed version in 1786. These two indexes had a major impact on the role of the dealer in the valuation process. Whereas art historians and curators were responsible for evaluating a painting's merit, the dealer was responsible for evaluating a work's provenance. Thus, the role of the dealer was elevated beyond a reseller, and transformed into that of an expert.

It was based on a decision taken by the Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation on 25 December 1944. Like the rest of the Eastern Europe, the purge against \\"Fascists\\" and \\"war criminals\\" became a central part of the construction of society based on the Soviet model. Background In November 1944, the socialist partisans (LAN√á) took power and began immediately with the arrest of all public figures who were perceived to have collaborated with the occupiers or not to have supported the LAN√á before. The Bashkimi newspaper of the Democratic Front of Albania had already been coming out in early January 1945 with agitative editorials pointing to \\"traitors\\" and \\"people's enemies\\". Sixty of these public figures were the object a treason trial in March 1945 at a socialist Special Court with Prosecutor Ko√ßi Xoxe. Xoxe, Minister of Interior, was considered from some as the most powerful person in Albania for the moment. Proceedings Various non-Socialist/non-Communists politicians were object of the court: Pro-Italians, Nazi collaborationists, Balli Kombetar members, previous Ministers, anti-Communist figures, military personnel, King Zog supporters, former publishers and journalists, and members of public administration during the Italian and German regime. \\"People's Tribunals\\" had been taking place since December 1944, but the most notorious was the Special Court of Tirana. The Special Court started in Tirana on 1 March 1945, and lasted until April 13 1945. The sessions took place in the premises of former \\"Savoja\\" cinema (renamed later to \\"Kosova\\" cinema, today's Albanian National Theater building). During this time it held 31 session and trialed 60 persons. General Lieutenant Ko√ßi Xoxe was the leading judge, while General Major Bedri Spahiu was the prosecutor. The jury had 9 members, others were Beqir Balluku, Medar Shtylla (Minister of Economy), Faik Shehu, Halim Budo, Gaqo Floqi, Hysni Kapo, Bilbil Klosi, Gjon Banushi.Skeda e Laz√´r Radit dhe Gjyqi Special (in Albanian) The defendants were: Most of them were found guilty: 17 were executed by firing squad, 8 received life imprisonment, and the rest various terms. Abdurrahman Telqiu and Luigj Filaj were released due to lack of evidence. Ded Jakova, Zef Shiroka, and Abedin Xhiku were sentenced to 1, 2, and 1 year but were released on probation. Aftermath With the demise of Ko√ßi Xoxe in 1949, few political figures, including the ones which would be arrested and sentenced later, would get partially rehabilitated. Other notorious trials would come out during the socialist period in Albania, i.e. the \\"Assembly Members' Group\\" (), the \\"Sabotators' Group\\" (), \\"Coup d'Etat Group\\" () and many more. Xoxe, Beqir Balluku, Bedri Spahiu would be later accused themselves of \\"treason\\" and \\"enemy of the people\\" and executed or imprisoned.Iv√°n T. Berend.

Their music features an eclectic range of electronic, woodwind, string and brass instruments, with a musical style described as indie rock meets hip hop production with a sprinkle of Disney. Kings Kaleidoscope has recorded 5 EP‚Äôs, and four LPs: Becoming Who We Are, Beyond Control, The Beauty Between, and Zeal.  Background  Based out of Seattle, WA, King's Kaleidoscope formed out of Gardner's eclectic group of musical friends, a random mix of musicians from genres that don't always belong together. King's Kaleidoscope started writing music that brought together seemingly opposite ideas, from gospel chops and dirty 808s to sweeping orchestral arrangements and sampling. King's aims to write music that is \\"as dope as it is genuine, a faithful, wholesome soundtrack born out of sincerity and hard work.\\" The group formed in 2010 at a Mars Hill Church plant on the campus of the University of Washington, where Gardner was a worship leader. Looking for a big, orchestral indie pop sound, he assembled a ten- person group. Drawing on a variety of influences from math rock and hip-hop to the dense sound of Canadian indie outfit Broken Social Scene, Kings Kaleidoscope recorded their first live EP, Sin, at a Good Friday service in 2011. A year later, they released the studio EP, Asaph's Arrows, shortly followed by a Christmas EP, Joy Has Dawned. In late 2013, Gardner and the band announced they were leaving Mars Hill, where they had served as worship leaders and artists on the church's label. Their fourth EP, 2014's Live in Color, was released by BadChristian Music, a label formed by Seattle post- hardcore band Emery. Working with BadChristian Music and well-established indie label Tooth & Nail Records, Kings Kaleidoscope released their debut LP, Becoming Who We Are, on October 27, 2014. The album includes the song \\"Zion\\", commemorating Gardner's son who died shortly before he started to write songs for the album. Their second album Beyond Control was released June 24, 2016, and was the band's most commercially successful release to date. Their third album, The Beauty Between, was released on August 17, 2017, and features several collaborations with hip-hop artists and producers, including Propaganda, Andy Mineo, Beautiful Eulogy, Derek Minor, Beleaf and DSTL. Their fourth album, Zeal, was released on April 5, 2019.

It is a development of the Sling 2 to accommodate four people, produced by Sling Aircraft of Johannesburg, South Africa. Design and development The Sling 4 is an all-metal, low-wing, fixed tricycle gear kit aircraft, developed in 2011. The canopy was modified to include gull-wing doors. The aircraft has flaps with 40 degrees of travel. It has been estimated that building a Sling 4 requires 900-1,200 man-hours of work. The aircraft can be supplied as a kit, or built by the factory. The US Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) tested the Sling 4 in 2016, citing a completed base price of US$123,417, rising to $192,000 with most options. Operational history In July 2013, a Sling 4 was flown by Mike Blyth and his son from South Africa to AirVenture in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, United States, carrying 20 hours endurance in fuel. The flight included a 14-hour leg over water. A Sling 4 kit was completed in four days by 40 workers from the factory, and flown at a 2014 South African Airshow. In a 2016 detailed review for Flying magazine, writer Marc C. Lee praised the design's controls, handling, aesthetics and load -carrying capabilities, while pointing out that it lacks cruise speed, an effective heater, has poor rubber molding and lacks a USB jack system. He also noted it cannot be taxied with the gull doors half open or cracked open. A group of about 20 South African teenagers built a Sling 4 in about three weeks in 2019, with the engine and avionics fitted by specialists. and planned to fly it to Cairo.

The building is an Historic National Monument of Mexico. Quinta Gameros currently houses the Centro Cultural Universitario Quinta Gameros, a regional museum of Mexico.  History  The mansion was built for Manuel Gameros Ronquillo, a member of the Porfirian elite. Construction started in October 1907 and finished in November 1910, just as the Mexican Revolution was commencing. Gameros and his family fled to the United States in 1913. Afterwards, Francisco Villa assumed the Governorship of Chihuahua and set out to redistribute the property of opposition families, including the Gameros'. Quinta Gameros was given to Venustiano Carranza as his personal residence and office in April 1914. Following a dispute with Villa, Carranza left the city and the Quinta Gameros would go on to be used for various purposes during the war, including as government offices and as a military hospital. Side view of the building. In 1921, the government of President √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n returned many of the confiscated properties to their former owners. The Gameros family returned and occupied the residence until 1926, when it was sold to the Government of the State of Chihuahua. The state government used the building as tribunal for the State Supreme Court and as offices for the Department of Education. As a result, the building was known as the Palacio de Justicia y Educaci√≥n P√∫blica. On 8 December 1954, Governor √ìscar Soto Maynez decreed the creation of the University of Chihuahua and earmarked the Quinta Gameros as the headquarters of the rectory and for the schools of Engineering, Law, and Music. A Museo Regional de Chihuahua was inaugurated on 22 November 1961 by President Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos. On 19 October 1968, the University became autonomous from the state, and Quinta Gameros passed on to form part of its patrimony. In 1971, an agreement was signed between UACH, INAH and Pedro Fossas Requena for the Requena Furniture Collection to become a permanent exhibition. In September 1991, the Museo Regional Quinta Gameros became the Centro Cultural Universitario Quinta Gameros.  Design  One of the statues at the main entrance. The main architectural style is Art Nouveau. A Belle √âpoque mansion, it also includes details of Rococo, Beaux-Arts architecture and Second Empire architecture.

At the main entrance there are four female statues stationed between the columns of the portico. The two sets of steps leading to the main entrance frame a small fountain depicting fishing boys. The fa√ßade is composed of floral, animal and human details primarily made from cantera. The house has a semibasement, ground level, first floor, and garret. The building has a 10,760 sq. ft. floor area. The ground floor has a double staircase and a Tiffany stained glass window. The main bedrooms, living room, dining hall and reception hall are on the first floor. The walls are decorated with oil paintings and the doorways with floral reliefs in wood made by European artists who were living in Mexico City. Both the ground and first floors have parquet floors.

In 2016, it was described as being in a state of disrepair and having had problems with vandalism. A community group, Business in Glen (BIG), was reported to be in negotiations to lease the building at this time; however, nothing further has been announced regarding this. Description The station complex consists of a first-class brick station building of a type 5 design with a brick-faced platform, dating from 1884. It also includes a timber signal box, metal water tank, water column, and timber overbridge with brick piers at the Sydney end of the station yard. The forecourt plantings are also included in the station's heritage listing.  Heritage listing  Glen Innes station is an excellent country Victorian railway station, well designed, detailed and proportioned. It is important in the development of the railways and marks the importance of Glen Innes in the railway system. The station building is a landmark building in the town terminating the vista of Wentworth Street. As a group it is significant and retains good elements from the early period of construction including the two residences. It is a fine example of a first class station building which is an enlargement of the standard roadside structure with the pavilions at each end and the central entry with colonnaded verandah. Glen Innes railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

It served the town of Tenterfield and opened on 1 September 1886 when the line was extended from Glen Innes. It was the terminus of the line until it was extended to Wallangarra on 16 January 1888. The railway station was designed by William Murray under the direction of John Whitton, the Chief Engineer of NSW Government Railways, and built during 1886. It is also known as Tenterfield Railway Station group. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The station has one platform with two loops. The last train to operate north of Tenterfield was an Australian Railway Historical Society charter on 15 January 1988 hauled by diesel locomotive 4487. The last train to operate north of Glen Innes was hauled by steam locomotive 3001 on 22 October 1989 after which the line was formally closed north of Dumaresq. The last train to regularly service Tenterfield was the overnight Northern Mail which ceased in November 1988. The Northern Tablelands Express provided a daylight service to Tenterfield until truncated in October 1985 to Armidale. After its closure, the station became home to the Tenterfield Railway Station Museum.  History  Tenterfield railway precinct is located on the Main North line, running from Sydney and extending north to the Queensland border, at the town of Wallangarra. The Main North Line (also known as the Great Northern Railway) runs through the Central Coast, Hunter and the New England regions. The line was the original main line between Sydney and Brisbane, however this required a change of gauge at Wallangarra. The line is now closed north of Armidale, and the main route between Brisbane and Sydney is now the North Coast line. In 1841 Sir Stuart Donaldson was running 18,000 sheep on a property that he named Tenterfield Station, after a family home in Scotland. Donaldson was the first Premier of New South Wales and made biannual trips to Tenterfield to inspect his holdings there, which covered of unfenced land. The township was gazetted in 1851 with allotments being sold in 1854. In 1858 gold was discovered at Drake (Fairfield) and shortly afterwards at Timbarra and Boonoo Boonoo. During 1859 an AJS Bank opened and an Anglican church was built the following year. In the 1860s The Tenterfield Chronicle was published; the district court was established; the building of a hospital commenced and a public school was opened. In 1870 the population was less than 900, but the town had five hotels, a school of arts and three churches. The existing Tenterfield Post Office was constructed in 1881. In February 1886 it was announced that the successful contractor for the erection of the station buildings at Tenterfield was William Murray. Murray also undertook to provide a goods shed, an engine shed, foundations for an engine tank, a pumping engine house, an engine store, a coal stage, a turntable pit, and various sheep and cattle races. On 1 September 1886 the line to Tenterfield was opened for business. By 1891 the engine driver's barracks had been completed, the last of the array of railway buildings and structures on the site.GBA; 2007 The site comprised a locomotive depot, demolished in 1968, consisting of an engine shed; barracks, sign-on office, coal stage, turntable, loading dock and goods shed, which are still extant on site; and water columns and tanks, sand sheds, ash pits and oil/equipment store which no longer exist. The original locomotive shed was constructed in 1886 and was replaced by a new one on the same site in 1908. The railway facilities at Tenterfield changed little over the next century. The only structural addition to the passenger station before World War I was an extension of the platform in 1907. In 1960 the station master's residence and the passenger station were connected to reticulated sewer system, but this was the only major work carried out in the station area. However, the buildings were modified to suit modern tastes. Old buildings were stripped of their decorative excesses to make them seem a little more modern. Thus, by 1965 Tenterfield Passenger Station had lost its wrought iron finials, timber pendants and fretted gable end decorations. By the 1960s, the Tenterfield locomotive depot was becoming redundant with steam being rapidly phased out and diesel technology not requiring an infrastructure of locomotive depots. There was certainly no need for extensive service facilities at Tenterfield and no need for such facilities as ash pits, coal stages, and water tanks. On 8 June 1968, with the end of steam operations on the Northern Line, the locomotive shed at Tenterfield was demolished. The development of the North Coast line resulted in a slow decline for Tenterfield, as passengers preferred the more direct route to Brisbane. The decline was most profound in the late 1950s and by November 1988 the last mail/passenger train left Tenterfield. On 17 July 1989, the State Rail Authority announced the pending closure of Tenterfield Railway Station, a decision that was effected on 30 November 1990. In 1991 the Tenterfield Railway Preservation Society was formed, and in 1992 a Heritage Museum was opened at the site. In 2007, the Office of Rail Heritage, Rail Corporation NSW, assumed management of seven key rail heritage precincts, which included Tenterfield. Tenterfield and Tenterfield railway station were associated with a number of historical events in Australia's history: * 1889Sir Henry Parkes delivered his famous Tenterfield speech calling for the Federation of Australia before departing on a special train to Sydney. The speech at the Tenterfield School of Arts is regarded as a significant event in the lead-up to Federation; * 1919a quarantine facility was set up in Tenterfield during the influenza pandemic; * 1942During World War II, Tenterfield was earmarked as a key battleground if the Japanese should invade Australia. During 1942 thousands of soldiers were set up in emergency camps, unbeknown to the locals, to cope with such an event. Minor changes were made to the railway barracks for defence requirements.  Description  New South Wales 620/720 class railcars at Tenterfield railway station, 2014 Major structures on the site include a type 5 first class station building, completed in 1886; a platform, completed ; a brick barrack, completed in 1890; a weatherboard barrack, completed ; a goods shed; a per way shed; and a sign- on shed. Other structural items include a turntable, with brickwork bedding, completed in 1899; a loading platform, made from pre-fabricated concrete; a T433 jib crane, completed in 1886; and forecourt plantings. Coal stage archaeological remnants were completed in . The Tenterfield station building was completed in 1886 and is a first class, long and narrow, single storey, brick structure with a painted, rendered exterior. It comprises a main central body flanked by small blocks, one on either side, separated from the main body of the building by a small courtyard. The architectural features and style bears references to Rustic Gothic in the use of steeply pitched prominent gables with decorative bargeboards, finials, pendants and label moulds, and Filigree in the use of cast iron filigree and ornamental columns to verandahs. The central body of the building has two projecting portions with sharply pitched gables rising above the roofline of the main body of the building. Three verandahs run in between the two projecting portions and to either side. The main roof is hipped and gabled with two small gablets (gable on hip) and is punctuated by numerous chimney shafts. The gables have prominent bargeboards, decorative timber fretwork, pendant and finial, and louvered timber ventilators. The front fa√ßade has decorative detailing in render in the form of raised mouldings/cornices and label courses. The rear fa√ßade is similar in features and detailing and has a series of doors and windows opening on to the platform. A deep verandah runs along the length of the central block on the platform side supported by cast iron columns. The layout comprises a waiting room in the centre with the main entrance, and a series of rooms on either side, all having access through the platform. The smaller side blocks have a gable front and a lean-to shed/verandah on the side opening onto the courtyard. The southern block is the men's toilet block and has a small gabled roof vent with louvers. The buildings retain their original configuration, having undergone very few modifications since their construction in 1886. The platform is brick faced and was extended in 1907. The platform includes two timber gates which are likely to be original, one at the southern end and the other at the northern; two \\"Tenterfield\\" metal signs, and an Avery weighing scale. The brick barrack building was completed in 1890 and is the former engine driver's residence and was constructed out of brick. It has a gable roof with smaller cross gables facing the front and rear. There are verandahs with simple timber posts along both elevations. Features and detailing including a chimney; scalloped timber valence to the sides of the verandahs; oval opening to the gables; plinth course and sill course in render; panelled doors with flymesh doors; and double hung windows with flymesh windows. The roof structure comprises timber king post trusses with raised tie and supporting timber boarding with corrugated, galvanised iron roofing. Some portions have ceilings which appear to be later additions. The chimney has two distinct vertical portions indicating that the eastern portion was added later, perhaps in 1942 when changes were made.Tenterfield Shire Local Heritage Register The original layout comprised four individual bedrooms in a back-to-back arrangement, each facing onto a verandah, with doors and windows opening onto it. A narrow combined toilet/ washroom/ bathroom extended across the width of the building with access from each of the verandahs. There was a larger meal room and a kitchen both with access from either verandahs. The building retains much of the original layout and features, displaying a high level of integrity. The weatherboard barracks were constructed in consist of three single storey weatherboard huts. Each hut comprises timber weatherboard walls and timber floor with a window in the centre of the east fa√ßade and a door in the centre of the west fa√ßade. The roof construction is unusual in having two corrugated, galvanised iron roof coverings with a gap between the two. The top one is a common roof and floats like a canopy with timber rafters supported by brackets under the projecting eaves mounted on walls through bolts. Each of the huts is supported by timber floor beams resting on masonry plinths. This might suggest that the huts were probably prefabricated and used as modular units. The huts are separated by gaps with windows on either side. Other features include double hung windows, battened doors, matchboard ceiling and weatherboard interior walls. The goods shed is in dimensions and was constructed in 1886 out of corrugated, galvanised iron cladding on timber framing with a gabled roof supported on timber brackets. The roof includes projecting eaves and exposed rafter ends. The barge boards have carved ends. There is a gable roofed, weatherboard office with a chimney, attached to the north side of the shed. The roof is supported by timber king post trusses. The windows are timber, double hung sash. A timber deck surrounds the building on all sides. For easy access to rail wagons, the building and deck are raised, the former on brick piers and the latter on timber stumps. There are protective rails all along the walls. The per way shed structure comprises a single-skin of corrugated, galvanised iron sheet cladding on steel frame and steel trusses supporting the gabled roof of corrugated, galvanised iron. The roof has overhanging eaves supported by steel brackets. The windows comprise unglazed openings. The shed is used to display trikes. The sign-on shed is understood to have been built in 1940s as a small timber-framed office building on the western side of the engine shed, between the barrack and the shed itself. The building originally had three distinct portions- chargeman/DLE's office, sign-on room, and WC/wash basin area. The lower portion of the exterior walls is weatherboard and the upper fibro cement board. Internally, the walls are asbestos cement sheeting. The building has a hipped roof clad in asbestos cement sheeting and an unusual corner brick fireplace/chimney. A full verandah runs along the front (eastern) fa√ßade and a pathway with steps led up through the terraced garden. The building retains good integrity. The building existed in a poor condition until 1999 when it was restored to its present state. It is currently used as the District Manager's office. The 1899 turntable is constructed out of cast iron and is in diameter. It is manually operated and sits on circular brickwork bedding. The loading platform is located towards the northern end of the railway precinct and comprises a raised area with ramps on both ends and a concrete retaining wall along the track. The concrete wall appears to be constructed of pre- fabricated panels. The T433 jib crane was constructed in 1886 and sits on a solid concrete pedestal/platform and is operational. The coal stage was constructed in 1949 out of timber bearers supported on steel beams on steel uprights made from rail tracks on the site of the original 1886 coal stage. Only scant remnants remain as relics of the original structure.  Condition  As at 8 May 2013, Railway station building: good Platform and its elements: moderate Trike display shed: good Timber barracks: moderate Residential Barracks: moderate Sign-on Office: good Coal stage: structurally sound Turntable: good Loading platform: good Goods shed: generally good but decking is in poor condition The precinct has a very good level of integrity with a near complete grouping of railway structures. The station buildings have a very good level of integrity and are in sound condition.  Modifications and dates  Since the 1886 construction of the railway station, coal stage, goods warehouse, Station Master's residence, water tank, turntable and locomotive shed, the railway station and precinct has been modified as follows: *1890Engine drivers barracks erected *1891Additional coal stage constructed. There is also reference to extension of a coal stage in 1908 and reconstruction of a coal stage (most likely the original) in 1949 to reduce length. *1899Original turntable replaced with turntable. Built by William Sellers of Philadelphia in 1886, it replaced an earlier diameter turntable, installed on a siding, which was a northern extension of the goods siding. *1908Coal stage extended original engine shed reconstructed and extended *1918Trackwork alterations and depressed sidings installed *1925An additional water tank installed *1928Hydraulic jacks installed for engine lifting *1929An additional water tank installed *1942Alterations for Defence requirements, to Barracks *1945Electric lighting to the engine shed & depot; telephone and call bells installed at the cocoa shed *1946Additional Locomotive accommodation installed *1947Coaling tractors improved *1948Additional locomotive accommodation installed *1949Coal stage reconstructed to reduced length *1950Hot water service installed at the Barracks *1951Improvements to the Loco. accommodation *1959Ash pit extended *sRailway institute demolished *1968Demolition of the engine shed *1989Trackwork removed ans the Tenterfield depot *2000Conservation works completed on station and yard  Heritage listing  Tenterfield is a major Victorian country first class station complex, one of the last designed by John Whitton, in its original setting with landscaped forecourt and good support buildings including the formerresidence, barracks and goods shed. The building retains much of its original fit out and is one of the best surviving station complexes in the State. The station building is one of the major structures in the northern part of the State and reflects the earliest period of railway construction in the north of the State. The buildings form an important townscape element in Tenterfield and contribute to the heritage value of the area. The Tenterfield railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Tenterfield railway precinct is state significant for its historical values as a tangible link to the development of the Great Northern Railway (GNR) line during the 19th century as well as the development of the NSW railways during the steam era. The GNR was an important achievement in transport and engineering within NSW. As the third main trunk rail route in NSW stretching from Sydney to the Queensland border, the line linked townships to one another as well as to Sydney leading to significant economic and social impacts for those individual townships as well as for NSW generally. The establishment of the station itself was one of the biggest events in the history of Tenterfield and its surrounding areas. Tenterfield railway precinct is a large and highly intact railway precinct demonstrating the typical elements of a large, 19th century railway station and yard with a large and grand, first class station building; a brick, engine drivers' barracks and 3 weatherboard huts; goods shed; a coal stage; a turntable pit; station master's residence; coal stage; footbridge, and associated facilities such as the jib crane. These items relate to the steam era of the railways and were once necessary and typical infrastructure found throughout NSW. The Tenterfield railway precinct is linked with a number of significant historical events such as the Federation movement; the flu epidemic following the first world war; visiting dignitaries; wars, and the gradual demise of the railway service. The station was the site of Sir Henry Parkes' departure for Sydney to advocate for Federation following his \\"Tenterfield speech\\" at the Tenterfield School of Arts; the departure and arrival of soldiers during the First World War; it became an emergency quarantine station when the influenza pandemic broke out in 1919; and the station yard provided accommodation for staff of the defence forces during WWII in the form of a special siding in 1942. Finally, the station's conversion to a museum is witness to the gradual decline in rail use leading to the closure of the Tenterfield line in late 1980s, following a similar pattern in other parts of the country. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Tenterfield railway station is associated with Sir Henry Parkes as an advocate of Federation. It was from Tenterfield railway station that he set out on a special train to Sydney after his historic speech at the Tenterfield School of Arts calling for a federation. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Tenterfield railway station has aesthetic significance as a first class station building (of which only 19 were built) demonstrating the architectural features and ornamentation of Rustic Gothic in the use of steeply pitched prominent gables with decorative bargeboards, finials, pendants and label moulds, and Filigree in the use of cast iron filigree and ornamental columns to verandahs. The front fa√ßade has decorative detailing in render in the form of raised mouldings/cornices and label courses. The rear fa√ßade is similar in features and detailing. It is a prominent building within the streetscape of Tenterfield. The street facade of the station building is highly intact and visible from a long distance. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Tenterfield railway precinct is of social significance to the local community having performed an important role in supporting the town as a regional centre for agricultural commerce and thereby being the site of significant activity and employment. The railway precinct is now a museum run by the Tenterfield Railway Preservation Society who actively conserve and promote rail heritage at the site. The site is significant for its ability to contribute to the local community's sense of place and provides a connection to the local community's past. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. As a large railway precinct consisting of a variety of buildings and structures with good integrity, Tenterfield railway precinct has the potential to provide research opportunities regarding the technical and operational aspects of a regional railway precinct during the steam era. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Tenterfield station is rare as a good example of a regional rail centre near a state border, which has retained examples of various periods of building and technology. The 1890 railway barracks are of particular significance as one of the oldest and most intact in NSW. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Tenterfield railway precinct is representative of a typical 19th century railway precinct, with a variety of buildings, structures and facilities associated with the steam era of railway technology as well as how this typical 19th century precinct developed both operationally and technologically over 100 years.
