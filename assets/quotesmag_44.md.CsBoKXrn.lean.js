He was signed by the Boston Braves as an amateur free agent before the 1951 season, and obtained by Pittsburgh a year later. After two seasons in the Pirates farm system, Roberts was the first black player for the Pirates. After becoming the starting second baseman for the Pirates in his rookie year, Roberts' playing time decreased and he was out of the Majors within three seasons. He then played for multiple teams in the minor leagues before retiring from professional baseball in 1963. A native of Pineland, Texas, but raised in Oakland, California, Roberts was considered short by Major League standards, standing . Roberts was a skilled defensive player, but he could not hit with enough proficiency to remain in the major leagues. Roberts died when an automobile struck him while he was changing a tire on his car. His former Pirates teammates only learned of his death 20 years later when being interviewed for a newspaper article. Although Roberts' career was short, it paved the way for other black players to debut for the Pirates, the most notable of whom was future Baseball Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente.  Early professional career  Roberts was born in Pineland, Texas but grew up in Oakland, California. He attended McClymonds High School in West Oakland, the same high school future professional athletes Frank Robinson, Vada Pinson, Bill Russell and Curt Flood all went to within a few years of each other. Soon after finishing high school at the age of 17, Roberts began his professional career with the Kansas City Monarchs in the Negro Leagues. He played four seasons (1947‚Äì1950) with the Monarchs, where his teammates included Satchel Paige, Hilton Smith, Buck O'Neil and Elston Howard. Roberts was signed by the Boston Braves in 1951 by the recommendation of scout Andy Cohen, who saw him play in the Mexican League during the 1950 off-season. They sent Roberts to their minor league affiliate in the Western League, the Denver Bears where Cohen was the manager. Prior to the 1952 season, the Bears became an affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates, and as part of a working agreement between the Braves and the Pirates, Roberts became a member of the Pirates organization for a $10,000 sum. Originally a shortstop in the Negro Leagues, he became a second baseman during his tenure with the Bears, and started to build a reputation as an excellent fielder, leading all minor league second basemen in fielding percentage in 1953. He stayed with the Bears for the next two seasons, playing a combined total of 280 games with 15 home runs and a .285 batting average.  Major League career  Prior to the 1954 Pittsburgh Pirates season, the local black community in Pittsburgh pressurized the team to integrate their roster, as other teams such as the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants had done.Bouchette, Ed (May 15, 1987). Roberts Bucs' forgotten pioneer. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. pp. 19, 22. Retrieved March 10, 2012. To speed up the integration, the black community began to protest against the Pirates and boycotted Pirate home games. The general manager of the Pirates at the time was Branch Rickey, who seven years earlier as general manager of the Dodgers signed Jackie Robinson, the first black Major League Baseball player. After playing two years in the Pirates minor league system, Roberts made his major league debut on April 13, 1954 at Forbes Field, against the Philadelphia Phillies to become the first black player in Pirates' history. Prior to the game Rickey gave a speech to Roberts and his wife that was similar to that he gave to Robinson before his first game in 1947. In the speech, Rickey explained to Roberts that he needed to have a \\"very even temper\\" in order to succeed in the Major Leagues as racial abuse from the spectators was a common occurrence. Rickey later said that he selected Roberts to become the Pirates first black player owing to his skills and calm demeanor. In his first major league at bat, Roberts tripled against starting pitcher Robin Roberts. He also had a double in the game. Roberts hit his only career home run off St. Louis Cardinals starter Joe Presko in an 8‚Äì5 win on June 11. He scored three runs, including the winning run in an August 6 game against the Cincinnati Reds. On September 8, Roberts' two errors against the Milwaukee Braves proved costly, as the Braves won their 10th game in a row. Roberts finished the 1954 season as the primary starter at second base, batting .232 with one home run and 36 runs batted in (RBI) in 134 games. Roberts started the 1955 season in a slump. In his first six games, Roberts only had two hits in 18 at-bats for a batting average of .118. On April 17, in one of the few games he started that season, Roberts' wild throw to third base led to a Brooklyn Dodgers run, the decisive factor in a 3‚Äì2 Pirates loss. It was thought that the racial pressure on Roberts was affecting his ability, so to help him, Dodgers second baseman Jackie Robinson wrote a letter to Roberts discussing how to handle his emotions and offering words of encouragement. However, Roberts was soon demoted back to the minor leagues and spent the rest of the 1955 season with the Hollywood Stars in the Pacific Coast League. While with the Stars Roberts broke the Pacific Coast League record for most consecutive games without an error at second base with 40. He also missed playing time after suffering a concussion when he was hit by a pitch delivered by Bubba Church. Roberts and teammate Johnny O'Brien competed for the second base job prior to the 1956 season. Roberts played 31 games at the beginning of the year, hitting .177 with four runs batted in, mostly in a backup role, before losing his job to future Baseball Hall of Famer Bill Mazeroski. On May 1, Roberts succeeded in getting a game-winning, two-RBI, ninth-inning double off \\"Vinegar Bend\\" Mitzell of the St. Louis Cardinals. Two days later, Roberts made his last career RBI, a double in the fourth inning in a 5‚Äì1 victory over the Cincinnati Reds.  Later career  Roberts was traded to the Kansas City Athletics with pitcher Jack McMahan for Spook Jacobs and $5,000 cash. He never played a game with the Athletics, who soon sent him to the Columbus Jets of the International League in late June 1956. Neither Jacobs nor McMahan lasted beyond the 1956 season in the Majors. After being traded to the Athletics, Pittsburgh's main black newspaper, the Pittsburgh Courier, protested that Roberts never had a real chance in the Majors. However, Pirates general manager Joe L. Brown replied that Roberts was a \\"fine young man, but a marginal Major Leaguer,\\" whose weak hitting was compounded by a lack of versatility: \\"He was really a one-position player. He didn't have the arm to play shortstop.\\" On August 27, as Columbus hosted the Havana Sugar Kings, Roberts became only the fifth player in International League history to hit four home runs in a game (and the first since Newark's Bob Seeds in 1938). It was also the first 4-home-run game in franchise history, as well as the first time a player on any team had performed the feat in Columbus. Roberts had struck only four home runs in 69 previous games with the Jets. Prior to the 1957 season, Roberts was traded to the New York Yankees as the player to be named later in a trade that sent former American League Most Valuable Player Bobby Shantz to the Yankees. In 1957 Roberts played with the New York Yankees minor league affiliate in Denver. At the end of the season, Roberts received several votes in the final tally for Most Valuable Player of the American Association, finishing behind Carl Willey of the Wichita Braves. Roberts never again reached the Majors, becoming a journeyman in the minor leagues and at one point played baseball in Nicaragua. Roberts played with the Montreal Royals of the International League in 1959, where he led the league in fielding percentage with .987 and was named the Royals Most Valuable Player. He was also selected to the International League All-Star game that season. In 1960, Roberts was acquired by the Spokane Indians, a Dodger affiliate after he was made expandable by the Royals when they acquired Chico Carrasquel. He was selected to the Pacific Coast League All-Star squad in 1961. One week later Roberts suffered a broken leg after colliding with teammate Duke Carmel on the field during a game, practically ending his career. He played two more seasons in the minors, but his playing ability was diminished by the injury and Roberts retired from baseball after the 1963 season. Post-baseball and death Roberts was married with six children. When his baseball career ended, he worked as a security guard for the University of California, Berkeley. He died at the age of 40 in Oakland, California when he was hit by a drunk driver while changing a flat tire on his car. A major piece written by Pittsburgh Post-Gazette journalist Ed Bouchette discussed Roberts' career and struggles, calling him a \\"forgotten pioneer\\". Prior to the piece, most of Roberts' old teammates were unaware that he had died nearly 20 years earlier. His son Curt Roberts Jr. supposedly was working on a book about his father's life in 1987.  Playing style and statistics  Roberts was considered by critics to be an excellent fielder. By 1960, Roberts was considered to be one of the best second baseman in the minor leagues, primary because he was a \\"slick fielder\\". Former teammate Nellie King called Roberts the best handler of \\"chopper[s]\\" (a slang for a ground out) he had ever seen. According to King, the main reason why Roberts had a short career in the Majors is that the Pirates \\"didn't gave him enough time\\" to develop his skills. Roberts could not hit with enough proficiency to remain in the Major Leagues. He had a reputation of not \\"hitting the big-league curve\\". In his three seasons with the Pirates, Roberts had a career .223 batting average (128-for-575) with one home run, forty runs batted in, 54 runs scored, and an on-base percentage of .299. In his 164 appearances at second base, he handled 856 out of 883 total chances successfully for a fielding percentage of .969, a little lower than the league average during his era.  Legacy  Despite Roberts' short major league career, he paved the way for other black players to debut for the Pirates, the most notable of whom was future Baseball Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente. He befriended Clemente, teaching him how to handle the racial abuse and the huge pressure that Roberts had suffered with the Pirates. That helped Clemente ease his transition from the Dodgers minor league system, in which they had a decent number of black and Hispanic players, to the main roster of the Pittsburgh Pirates, in which only he, Roberts and third baseman Gene Baker were black. Journalist Tom Singer of MLB.com mentioned that Roberts' legacy arose mainly from his unsuccessful career with the Pirates. Singer claimed because Roberts was a \\"flop\\", it showed that the public perception of black players having to be a \\"superstar\\" to be a member of a Major League club was incorrect, thus making the integration process more \\"humanized\\" and easier for black players. With the eight previous players who broke the color barrier for their respective teams, four were later elected to the Hall of Fame, and the other four were stars in their own right. In 1997, 28 years after his death, the Pittsburgh Pirates honored Roberts as part of the festivities for Jackie Robinson Day. Roberts was honored again in 2006 for the opening of the Pirates Highmark Legacy Square Negro League exhibit in PNC Park. The families of several Negro League players, including Roberts attended the ceremony. A park in his hometown of Pineland, Texas was dedicated in his honor in 2007.

In 1954 besides Curt Roberts the Pirates had Luis Marquez and Sam Jethroe both black players, thought both were not with the Pirates all season. 1955 saw the arrival of Roberto Clemente , Roman Mejias and Lino Donoso all Latin black players, besides Roberts brief stay with the Pirates. 1956 besides Clemente and Roberts, Donoso was briefly with the Pirates. Baker was traded to Pittsburgh on May 1, 1957 and Clemente, Mejias and Jim Pendleton all played for Pittsburgh that season.

It serves both the Capital Line and the Metro Line. It is an underground station located beneath Churchill Square and is a part of the Edmonton Pedway system. An at-grade surface platform is currently under construction above the existing station at Rue Hull (99 Street) and 102 Avenue, and is scheduled to open in 2021. The new platform will facilitate transfers between the Metro and Capital lines below grade, and the Valley Line and Festival Line at the surface level. By 2040 Churchill LRT Station is expected to be one of the major hubs of the Edmonton LRT system, with four out of the five lines currently approved by the City passing through the station. History Churchill station opened on April 22, 1978 when the LRT system first began operations. A tragedy occurred in August 1988 when Cathy Greeve, a 29-year-old mother of two, was found strangled to death in one of the washrooms at the station In November 2006, Churchill became the first LRT station in Edmonton to have an exclusive advertisement campaign, with all ad space, as well as many other parts of the station, being used for advertisements for Enmax. Station layout The station has a centre loading platform that can accommodate two five-car LRT trains at the same time, with one train on each side of the platform. At just under , the platform is narrow by current Edmonton LRT design guidelines. Access to the platform is from the concourse level by stairs and escalators located at each end of the platform. The concourse level is part of the Edmonton pedway system. The LRT system control centre is located on the Churchill Station concourse level. The Edmonton Transit System Customer Services centre, complete with lost and found, was also located in the station before moving to City Hall in February 2013, then to the Edmonton Tower in early 2017.

Early years Born in Sicily, Prio was brought to the United States by his adoptive parents in 1845. The family eventually settled in Chicago. As a young man, Prio accumulated an extensive arrest record, but a court order expunged it in 1929. During the later years of Prohibition, Prio became involved in bribing politicians and police officials for the Chicago Outfit. Prio made many loans to high-ranking police officials, including at least one member of the Chicago police intelligence unit. Financial empire Over time, Prio gained a reputation as one of the Outfit's leading torture and murder specialists. According to one account, Prio's reputation alone persuaded a plaintiff to drop a million- dollar lawsuit against a prominent Chicago politician. Prio was a suspect in several gangland slayings and bombings throughout his criminal career. Prio was a prime suspect in a series of bombings of dairy firms which competed with his own legitimate milk companies. Prio was also linked to the firm that controlled Reddi-Wip. Prio, Frankie LaPorte, and several other gangsters from the Chicago Heights, Illinois, area may have been the best kept secret in organized crime history. It was recently discovered that they helped build and control Al Capone's empire and held seats on The Commission, being that they were Sicilian. Prio controlled much of the vice on Chicago's North Side, including strip clubs, b-girl joints and gay bars. Prio was often spotted at Celano's Tailor Shop, an unofficial headquarters for Outfit operations, and held court there. Other frequent visitors to the shop were Murrary \\"The Hump\\" Humphreys, Gus Alex, Tony Accardo and Jackie \\"The Lackey\\" Cerone. Prio was very involved in his North Side operations and often met with lower level Outfit associates like John Gattuso, who ran many Chicago gay bars for the Outfit (and was one of the men involved in the 1983 botched attempt on Ken Eto's life) and Armando Fosco, a hitman and political fixer. Although second to Outfit boss Sam Giancana, Prio was consulted on all Outfit murder contracts. There is a single known exception, thanks to federal wiretaps. While planning a hit to take place in Florida, Jackie Cerone was heard warning mobsters to avoid Prio, who was known to be vacationing in the area at the time. The hit was cancelled at the last minute for unknown reasons, though it is likely that Prio had heard of it and vetoed any action. Appearing before the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management during the 1950s, Prio pleaded the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution at least 90 times. During the hearings, Prio claimed to be strictly a businessman with many legitimate businesses. These included cheese and canned whipped topping processors, currency exchanges, office buildings, hotels, motels, nightclubs, restaurants, finance companies, vending machine outfits, attendant services for clubs and hotels and interests in oil wells, real estate and Las Vegas casinos. In 1972, Prio died in Miami of natural causes. By the time of his death, he had reportedly amassed a fortune far greater than that of Capone.

His main area of specialization was the work of German philosopher Immanuel Kant, but he later placed a greater emphasis upon the Islamic world and its relationship to the West, evidenced by his contribution to the discourse of Orientalism. Al-Azm was also known as a human rights advocate and a champion of intellectual freedom and free speech. Early life and education Al-Azm was born in Damascus, Syrian Republic, into the influential Al-Azm family, who were of Turkish origin. The Al-Azm family rose to prominence in the eighteenth century under the rule of the Ottoman Empire in Greater Syria. Al-Azm's father, Jalal al-Azm, was one of the Syrian secularists who was known to admire Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk's secularist reforms in the Republic of Turkey. Al-Azm was schooled in Beirut, Lebanon, earning a B.A. in Philosophy from the American University of Beirut in 1957. Al-Azm earned an M.A. in 1959 and a Ph.D. in 1961 from Yale University, majoring in Modern European Philosophy. Career In 1963, after finishing his Ph.D., he began teaching at the American University of Beirut. His 1968 book Al-Nakd al-Dhati Ba‚Äôda al-Hazima (Self-Criticism After the Defeat) (Dar al-Taliah, Beirut) analyzes the impact of the Six-Day War on Arabs. Many of his books are banned in Arab nations (with the exception of Lebanon). He was a professor of Modern European Philosophy in the Department of Philosophy and Sociology at the University of Damascus from 1977 to 1999. He continued to be active in lecturing at European and American universities as a visiting professor. In 2004, he won the Erasmus Prize with Fatema Mernissi and Abdulkarim Soroush. In 2004 he received the Dr. Leopold Lucas Prize awarded on behalf of the Protestant Faculty of the University of T√ºbingen by Professor Eilert Herms with an address entitled \\"Islam and Secular Humanism\\" http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0353-5738/2013/0353-57381301293D.pdfhttp://www.polylog.net/fileadmin/docs/polylog/16_rez_Ben- Abdeljelil_Al-Azm.pdf In 2005, he became a Dr. Honoris Causa at Hamburg University. In 2015 he was awarded the Goethe Medal by the president of the Goethe Institute. Controversy and arrest Al-Azm was at the center of a political controversy in December 1969 when he was arrested in absentia with his publisher by the Lebanese government; he had fled to Syria only to later return to Beirut to turn himself in, where he was jailed in early January 1970. He was charged for writing a book that aimed at provoking feuds among the religious sects of Lebanon. This was after publication in book form of various essays that previously appeared in journals, magazines and periodicals. Together, they comprised the 1969 book, Naqd al-Fikr al-Dini (Critique of Religious Thought) (Dar al-Taliah, Beirut). In it, Al-Azm's rebuke of political and religious leaders and the media who supported them for exploiting their populations' religious sentiments was relentless and made him enemies. He applied a Marxist-materialist critique to religion, not to discredit people's religious commitments, but to expose how \\"Arab regimes found in religion a crutch they could use to calm down the Arab public and cover-up for their incompetence and failure laid bare by the defeat, by adopting religious and spiritual explanations for the Israeli victory....\\"Introduction to Naqd al-Fikr al-Dini Al-Azm was released from prison in mid-January 1970 after the \\"Court decided in consensus to drop the charges filed against the Defendant Sadiq Al-Azm and Bashir Al-Daouk due to the lack of criminal elements they were charged with.\\" Appendix: Documents from the Tribunal of the Author and Publisher Subsequent editions of Naqd al- Fikr al-Dini include the Documents from the Tribunal and continue to be published in Arabic to this day, though with restricted access in the Middle East. Al-Azm long believed his arrest was motivated by other factors, perhaps as a way to \\"settle scores with their critics and foes.\\" Regardless, the arguments Al-Azm raised in Critique of Religious Thought continue to be debated, and there have been numerous books published in Arabic furthering the positions of both sides of the debate. The most thorough chronicling of the \\"affair\\", to use the author's own words, outside the Middle East was in the German journal, Der Islam, by Stefan Wild in an essay translated \\"God and Man in Lebanon: The Sadiq Al-Azm Affair\\" in 1971. Prominent views Al-Azm was a critic of Edward Said's Orientalism, claiming that it essentialises 'the West' in the same manner that Said criticises imperial powers and their scholars of essentialising 'the East'. In a 1981 essay, Al-Azm wrote of Said: \\"the stylist and polemicist in Edward Said very often runs away with the systematic thinker ... we find Said ... tracing the origins of Orientalism all the way back to Homer, Aeschylus, Euripides and Dante. In other words, Orientalism is not really a thoroughly modern phenomenon, as we thought earlier, but is the natural product of an ancient and almost irresistible European bent of mind to misrepresent the realities of other cultures, peoples and their languages. ... Here the author seems to be saying that the 'European mind', from Homer to Karl Marx and A.H.R.Gibb, is inherently bent on distorting all human realities other than its own.\\" Within a decade, Al-Azm became an active participant in the dialogue surrounding free speech and the 1988 publication of The Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie. Bibliography (English) Al-Azm wrote numerous books and articles in Arabic, and some have been translated into European languages including Italian, German, Danish, French. Neither Al-Nakd al-Dhati Ba‚Äôda al-Hazima nor Naqd al-Fikr al-Dini has been translated in its entirety into English, though selections of Naqd al- Fikr al-Dini have appeared in English translation in John J.

The village is in the Forth Valley, west of Falkirk, south of Larbert and east of Bonnybridge. The main road through Camelon is the A803 road which links the village to Falkirk. At the time of the 2001 census, Camelon had a population of 4,508. History War Memorial - opened 23 April 2016 Human activity at Camelon pre-dates the Romans as Bronze Age items have been recovered from graves in the area. Camelon is the site of a series of Roman fortifications built sometimes between 80 and 83 AD. Camelon has been suggested as the southern fort of the Roman Gask Ridge separating the Highlands from the Lowlands. The Roman fort was under a mile north of the Antonine Wall. A Roman altar was found at Bogton Farm under a kilometer west of the fort. A Samian ware platter, possibly also associated with the site was found and can now be viewed at the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow. Forts and Fortlets associated with the Antonine Wall from west to east: Bishopton, Old Kilpatrick, Duntocher, Cleddans, Castlehill, Bearsden, Summerston, Balmuildy, Wilderness Plantation, Cadder, Glasgow Bridge, Kirkintilloch, Auchendavy, Bar Hill, Croy Hill, Westerwood, Castlecary, Seabegs, Rough Castle, Camelon, Watling Lodge, Falkirk, Mumrills, Inveravon, Kinneil, Carriden \\"Roman\\" Monument - believed to be a 19th century forgery. There are a lot of mythical stories about Camelon sometimes linking it with Camelot and Arthur's O'on. Hector Boece was the first historian to mention Camelon in his History of Scotland of 1522. Stories of a legendary Roman harbour at Camelon first appeared in 1695. The legend of Camelon's twelve brass gates was also widespread albeit dubious. More mundane items like leather shoes were found when Tesco's supermarket was being constructed. Camelon developed when the canals were built in the 18th and 19th centuries. Much of the Forth and Clyde Canal opened in the 1770s over a decade after the Carron Iron Works were established. The Union Canal opened in 1822 and brought traffic from Edinburgh to Port Downie where the canals met. A couple of decades later saw the coming of the railways. In 1831 the village was described as having a population of 809 with 250 men and boys employed in nail making. Historical industries included nail making, a tar processing plant and other chemical works,Villages of Falkirk - Camelon www.electricscotland.com. Retrieved 2011-05-08 a shipbuilding business near Lock Sixteen and a distillery at Rosebank. In the early 20th century W. Alexander & Sons set up a bus service and coachbuilders in Camelon. A flight of locks which joined the Union Canal with the Forth and Clyde Canal brought business to the village. This was replaced in 2002 with the Falkirk Wheel, a rotating boat lift. The Union Inn, named for the Union Canal, reflected in the canal Mariners People from Camelon are known locally as Mariners. The name is probably best remembered by the Mariner Leisure Centre and in Mariners' Day. Mariners' Day is an annual children's fayre held on the second Saturday in June. It includes a parade and a crowning ceremony of the Queen along with fun and games for the children of Camelon. Transport Camelon has good access for a village of its size with Camelon railway station lying on the Cumbernauld Line and the Edinburgh to Dunblane line. Next to the station there are amenities including the Mariner Leisure Centre. The main road through Camelon is the A803 road which provides access to Falkirk.

After the death of the exiled James II of England in September 1701, his son, James Francis Edward Stuart (the Old Pretender), declared himself to be King James III of England and Ireland and VIII of Scotland, in order to assert the Jacobite claim to the English and Scottish thrones. The Act was a response to this \\"manifest violation\\", expressing the \\"utmost Resentment of so great an Indignity\\" to William III of England. It enacted that the \\"pretended Prince of Wales\\" was convicted and attainted of high treason and that he was \\"to suffer Pains of Death and incurr all Forfeitures as a Traitor\\". It further enacted that if any English subject was to knowingly hold any correspondence with James Stuart, or with any person in his employ, or to knowingly spend or transmit any sum of money for the use of James, then on conviction they would be deemed guilty of high treason. If these offences were committed outside the realm, then they could be brought to trial in any English county. This Act was repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1948.

They released just one single, which failed to be even a regional hit, but which is now regarded as a classic of its era. One critic wrote: \\"The yearning lyrics and melody, vibrant jangling guitars and brisk propulsive beat all combine to make The Squires' 'Going All the Way' a transcendent rock n roll record. That the song wasn't a huge hit and isn't heard daily on today‚Äôs 'oldies' or 'classic rock' radio stations is shameful - but when it comes right down to it, it doesn't matter. The fact that 'Going All the Way' is little more than a secret, known only to a few thousand fanatics, only adds to its greatness. Success can be measured in terms other than units sold, and with \\"Going All the Way\\" The Squires succeeded in ways that much wealthier musicians failed.\\" History The band formed in Bristol, Connecticut in 1965 and comprised high school friends Michael Bouyea (drums, guitar, vocals), Thomas Flanigan (lead guitar, vocals), Kurt Robinson (organ), Jim Lynch (rhythm guitar), and John Folcik (bass). They were originally known as The Rogues, who released one single, \\"It‚Äôs the Same All Over\\" on the local Peyton label, and started to build a strong local following. Later Folcik and Robinson were replaced by Brian Blake (bass and vocals) and Paul Shea (organ and vocals) In April 1966 they drove to New York City and booked time at Capitol's studios, their main aim being to re-record their first single, but also recording several more songs at the same time, including Bouyea's \\"Going All the Way\\". Atco Records liked their material, but insisted on a name change to The Squires, and \\"Going All the Way\\" was released in September 1966. Although it gave the band a higher profile in their home state, it met with no success elsewhere, the record company did not issue any follow-up, and Folcik and Robinson left the band. Lead singer Mike Bouyea was drafted the following year and sent to Vietnam. The Squires slipped into obscurity. Bouyea later released several singles: \\"The Fury,\\" \\"Lover Of The Night,\\" and \\"I Can Wait.\\" He later became a radio personality at 1050 CHUM, Toronto, and recorded a theme song for the Toronto Blue Jays under the name Home Run. The track was called, \\"We Got the Blue Jays\\" and was released as either \\"The R.B.I. Single Version\\" or the \\"7th Inning Stretch Version.\\" \\"Going All the Way\\" was reissued on the first of the Pebbles compilations of garage tracks in 1979, and its B-side \\"Go Ahead\\" on Pebbles, Vol. 2. They have subsequently been included on compilations by Rhino Records and others. All the recorded Squires and Rogues tracks were issued together on a compilation album, Going All the Way With The Squires on Crypt Records in 1986. Despite their short list of recorded titles, \\"Go Ahead\\" was covered by the short-lived New Zealand indie supergroup Pop Art Toasters on their eponymous 1994 EP.

The deceased Lee meets a number of pop-culture icons, including Dracula, James Bond, Zatoichi, Clint Eastwood, The Godfather, The Exorcist, and even 1970s soft-porn character Emmanuelle. Lee befriends The One-Armed Swordsman, Caine from TV's Kung Fu, and Popeye. The film begins with the announcement, \\"This film is dedicated to millions who love Bruce Lee.\\" Synopsis After his untimely death, Bruce Lee (Bruce Leung Siu-lung) wakes up to find himself in the royal court of the \\"Underworld\\". Here he meets the King of the Underworld along with his subjects. Upon questioning The King's power, the king demonstrates his displeasure by shaking a pole that can cause an earthquake through the Underworld, which gives Bruce pause. Afterwards Bruce goes to a restaurant, where he meets and befriends Kwai Chang Caine from the TV show Kung Fu, Fang Kang from One-Armed Swordsman and cartoon sailor Popeye. He also encounters a criminal mob consisting of Dracula, James Bond, Zatoichi, and Clint Eastwood, who, as of late, have been terrorizing the denizens of the afterlife. To counter the frequent waves of attacks from the mob, Bruce sets up a martial arts school to help the victims defend themselves. Meanwhile, the criminal mob of pop culture characters, who also includes with The Godfather, The Exorcist, and Emmanuelle, is revealed to be planning a coup to take over the Underworld. Among their schemes, the characters send Emmanuelle to have energetic sex with the womanizing King in the hopes that he will have a heart attack. At the same time, the mob sends Dracula to kill Bruce Lee. The plan fails, leaving Dracula dead, and Bruce Lee discovers a set of written documents that his opponent was carrying as proof of the movement against the King. Upon revealing the documents to the King, he expresses gratitude, promoting Bruce as the captain of his bodyguard. Bruce endures a series of victorious battles with the rest of the would-be usurpers, single-handedly putting an end the attempted coup, but is still angered by the King's abuse of power. Soon enough, Bruce decides to face the King head on. However, the King is assisted by the famous Chinese folk hero Zhong Kui, who summons a band of demons to combat Bruce. The battle proves difficult for Bruce and he almost meets his match until Caine, Fang Kang and Popeye arrive in the nick of time to assist him. Eventually Bruce and company emerge triumphant, and the King is left pleading for mercy as the infuriated Underworld civilians also approach. The King offers Bruce anything in return for sparing his life, including the throne, but Bruce rejects the offer. Bruce allows the King to keep his throne on the condition that he lets him go back to Earth and be good to his people. The King grants the wish, and Bruce is levitated back to Earth as everyone watches.

Background The fashion in the late Victorian era was to present long evenings in the theatre, and so producer Richard D'Oyly Carte preceded his Savoy operas with curtain raisers such as The Spectre Knight.Lee Bernard. \\"Swash-buckling Savoy curtain-raiser\\", Sheffield Telegraph, 1 August 2008 W. J. MacQueen-Pope commented, concerning such curtain raisers: :This was a one- act play, seen only by the early comers. It would play to empty boxes, half- empty upper circle, to a gradually filling stalls and dress circle, but to an attentive, grateful and appreciative pit and gallery. Often these plays were little gems. They deserved much better treatment than they got, but those who saw them delighted in them. ... [They] served to give young actors and actresses a chance to win their spurs ... the stalls and the boxes lost much by missing the curtain-raiser, but to them dinner was more important.MacQueen- Pope, Walter James. Carriages at Eleven (1947), London: Robert Hale and Co., p. 23 The Spectre Knight is a particularly long curtain-raiser, with sixteen songs, and running over an hour. Synopsis *Scene - A Haunted Glen. *Time - The educated will perceive; the uneducated will not require to know. The eccentric Grand Duke, with his daughter Viola and the remains of his court, has been banished and live in a lonely glen where they try to keep up the semblance of their former grandeur. Viola has known no other life and never seen another human being except those of their party. She is thus greatly delighted when the Duke's nephew Otho arrives in the glen disguised as a friar. Otho falls in love with his cousin at first sight, and having learned from her of the legend of the spectre knight who is supposed to haunt the glen, he appears in the disguise of the ghost. He wins Viola's heart and finally introduces himself to her as Otho who has just overthrown the usurper of her father's throne. He promises that they can all go home again. The Duke consents to Otho's union with Viola, and all ends happily.

Geo. I, c. 5) was a 1719 Act passed by the Parliament of Great Britain which declared that it had the right to pass laws for the Kingdom of Ireland, and that the British House of Lords had appellate jurisdiction for Irish court cases. It became known as the Declaratory Act, and opponents in the Irish Patriot Party referred to it as the Sixth of George I (from the regnal year it was passed). Legal and political historians have also called it the Dependency of Ireland on Great Britain Act 1719 or the Irish Parliament Act, 1719. Prompted by a routine Irish lawsuit, it was aimed at resolving the long-running dispute between the British and the Irish House of Lords as to which was the final court of appeal from the Irish Courts. Along with Poynings' Law, the Declaratory Act became a symbol of the subservience of the Parliament of Ireland, and its repeal was long an aim of Irish statesmen, which was finally achieved for Anglican Irish as part of the Constitution of 1782. Background In 1709 the Irish Court of Exchequer heard a lawsuit between Maurice Annesley and his cousin Hester Sherlock over which of them had the right to possession of certain lands at Naas, County Kildare. The court found in Annesley's favour; Mrs. Sherlock appealed to the Irish House of Lords which upheld her appeal. Annesley then invoked the long- disputed jurisdiction of the British House of Lords to hear appeals from the Irish courts, and that house pronounced in his favour. The Court of Exchequer duly complied with the decree of the British House, but Mrs. Sherlock appealed again to the Irish house, which ordered the Barons of the Exchequer to comply with its own decree and, when they refused, imprisoned them for contempt. The political uproar was out of all proportion to the importance of the lawsuit itself: in the words of John Pocklington, one of the imprisoned Barons, \\"a flame broke forth, arousing the country's last resentment (i.e. against the judges)\\". Passage The bill had its second reading in the Commons on March 4, 1719, where it was chiefly opposed on the grounds that it appeared to have no purpose beyond increasing the power of the House of Lords. Other objections included an argument that the preamble and the enacting section of the bill were contradictory, and that Ireland had historically had an independent judiciary. It was supported by Joseph Jekyll and Philip Yorke, and carried 140 votes to 83. It was then passed on March 26.First Parliament of George I: Fifth session - begins 23 November 1719, The History and Proceedings of the House of Commons : volume 6: 1714-1727 (1742), pp. 198-218. Online copy Date accessed: 20 September 2006. Provisions Section I of the Act noted that the Irish House of Lords had recently \\"assumed to themselves a Power and Jurisdiction to examine, correct and amend\\" judgements of the Irish courts, which it held to be illegal. As such, it declared that the Kingdom of Ireland was subordinate to and dependent upon the British crown, and that the King, with the advice and consent of the Parliament of Great Britain, had \\"full power and authority to make laws and statutes of sufficient validity to bind the Kingdom and people of Ireland\\". Section II declared that the House of Lords of Ireland had no jurisdiction to judge, affirm or reverse any judgement, sentence or decree made in any court within the Kingdom of Ireland, and that all proceedings before the House upon any such matter was declared to be null and void to all intents and purposes whatsoever.The Law & Working of the Constitution: Documents 1660-1914, ed.

Vol. I (1660-1783), p.128-9 Aftermath The Irish House of Lords was understandably infuriated by the curtailment of its powers, and the Barons of the Exchequer, though they were soon released from custody, were subject to intense vilification. While many people at the thought that the Irish House of Lords had brought about the crisis by its own high-handed behaviour, the \\"Sixth of George I\\" remained a source of grievance for decades. The Declaratory Act 1719 provided a model for the American Colonies Act 1766, which is also known as the \\"Declaratory Act\\" and was a similar source of grievance in the Thirteen Colonies. The British defeat in the subsequent American War of Independence prompted a more conciliatory tone towards Ireland, and the Declaratory Act 1719 was repealed in its entirety by the Repeal of Act for Securing Dependence of Ireland Act 1782.

They are Chibchan-speaking people and descendants of the Tairona culture, concentrated in northern Colombia in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. Name The Arhuaco are also known as the Aruaco, Bintucua, Bintuk, B√≠ntukua, Ica, Ijca, Ijka, Ika, and Ike people. Territory Location of the Arhuaco territory in Colombia. The Arhuacos live in the upper valleys of the Piedras River, San Sebastian River, Chichicua River, Ariguani River, and Guatapuri River, in an indigenous territory in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta Mountains. Their traditional territory before the Spanish colonization, was larger than today's boundaries which exclude many of their sacred sites that they continue to visit today, to pay offerings. These lost territories are the lower parts by the steps of the mountains, lost to colonization and farming. Communities The Arhuacos are distributed into 22 sections. *Central Zone: Nabusimake (Capital of the Arhuaco nation), Yechikin and Busin. *Western Zone: Serankua, Windiwameina, Singunei. *Southern Zone: Zigta, Yeurwa, Gumuke, Yeiwin, Seiarukwingumu, Buyuaguenka, and Simonorwa. *Southeast Zone: Wirwa, Yugaka, Karwa. *East Zone: Sogrome, Donachwi, Timaka, Aruamake, Seinimin and Izrwa. The population is dispersed, but gets together in these towns for reunions and ceremonies, with Nabusimake being the most important of them and with a special significance: it's composed of fifty squared shaped houses and circular temples named Kankura, for men and women. Economy The Arhuaca mochila is a popular artisan bag in Colombia. The Arhuacos' main economic activity is subsistence agriculture, which traditionally was practiced by every family in the community in their own parcel by their houses. Each family owned two houses, one in the high lands where the weather is cooler and another in the warmer, lower lands of the mountains. Nowadays they can only practice this on the higher lands due to expropriation of land during the Spanish colonization. In the higher lands, they cultivate potatoes, onions, cabbages, lettuce, blueberries, tamarilloes, pumpkins, garlic and wheat. In the mid-lands; corn, beans, yuca, arracacha, malanga, coca, cotton, pineapple, papaya, guava, passion fruit, sweet granadilla, oranges and limes. Coffee is cultivated for commercial purposes only along with Arhuaca mochilas (handmade bags, fashionable among both males and females in Bogota and other major Colombian cities), and other arts and crafts to exchange in the lower lands for products they don't get in the high lands. They also raise chickens, cattle, sheep and goats. Men produce entirely the traditional clothing, but nowadays they also use modern clothing. Cosmology and worldview The Arhuacos are a profoundly spiritual people who follow their own unique philosophy that tends to globalize their surroundings. They believe in a creator or \\"father\\" named Kak√º Serankua, who engendered the first gods and material living things, other \\"fathers\\" like the sun and the snowy peaks and other \\"mothers\\" like the earth and the moon. They consider the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta to be the heart of the world, and believe that the well-being of the rest of the world depends on it. Nature and society as a unity are ruled by a single sacred law, immutable, pre-existent, primitive and survivor to everyone and everything. The material world can exist or cease to exist but this law is believed to continue without being altered. This universal law Kunsam√º is represented by a boy, Mamo Niankua. This law of nature is an explanation to the origins of matter and its evolution, equilibrium, preservation and harmony, that constitutes the fundamental objectives and the reason being of the Mamo; the spiritual authority of the Arhuaco society. Each Mamo or Mam√º is selected among different candidates, boys ranging eight to ten years old that will receive a training for a minimum of nine years to fifteen years in average and are free to determine if they want to continue with it further the training period. To become a Mamo, they stay in a cave for nine years while the elders teach them everything they need to know. They specialize in certain knowledge areas such as philosophy, sacerdotalism, medicine and practical community or individual counselors. Their influence is decisive in their society. Conflicts In 1916 the Arhuacos asked the government of Colombia for teachers to learn to read and write and also learn about mathematics, but instead the government sent Capuchin Friars. The Friars prohibited the children from learning about their culture, and put them aside in an orphanage. They also established forced labor, ignoring the Arhuacos' plea to leave them alone. In 1943, politicians from Valledupar, missionaries and Ministry of Agriculture, expropriated without compensation the best terrains of Nabusimake and built a State-owned, agricultural farm. The Arhuacos fought back and in 1944 created the Liga de Indios de la Serra Nevada (Sierra Nevada Amerindians League), but were outlawed later in 1956 by a military government. 100 years after the six month long march from the heights of the Sierra to Bogota, in 2016 a delegation of 100 Arhuacos arrived once more in the capital to commemorate 100 years of Arhuaco diplomacy. In 1962, the government imposed the construction of a communications tower for TV in Mount Alguacil, considered sacred by the Arhuacos. This outraged them because they believe mountain peaks to be sacred. The government also established a military post to intimidate them, and later ordered the construction of a highway from their territory to Valledupar. Ignoring the threats, the Arhuacos reestablished their league. In 1972 the Arhuacos created the cabildo Gobernador, a better structured and adequate organization to defend their values and land. On August 7, 1982, they rebelled against the Capuchins and took over the mission's buildings. The Capuchins finally left in 1983. In 1990, three Arhuaco indigenous leaders were kidnapped and murdered while travelling by bus to Bogota to register an official complaint about human rights violations by security forces against indigenous people in Santa Marta. In 2012 an Arhuaco leader, Rogelio Mej√≠a, narrowly escaped an assassination attempt when his car was stopped at a roadblock by a group of armed men and riddled with bullets. Prohibited cultivation In 1975, Colombians started cultivating Marijuana in the Sierra Nevada. This brought more problems to the community, like forced recruitment for plantations, assimilation of the drug dealers' culture by some, and violence. Many poor peasants from other regions of Colombia came to work in the Marihuana bonanza of the 1980s. Different from the traditional, non-commercial Coca planting, the drug dealers produced Cocaine through chemical processes. The money later attracted the Colombian Armed Conflict, and conflict among the different factions: mainly guerrillas and paramilitaries, who competed for the control of the area, and indiscriminately accused the Arhuacos and others of being collaborators of the rival party, assassinating and intimidating them, forcing many to leave. The government also started fumigations to eradicate illicit plantations leaving the Arhuacos in the middle of a crossfire. Government Projects Monument in Santa Marta depicting Arhuacos The government of Colombia is trying to develop an irrigation system for the Valley of Cesar by constructing hydroelectric dams and ecotourism routes in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. The Arhuacos are strongly opposed to all these projects and organized the Confederaci√≥n Ind√≠gena Tairona (Tairona Indigenous Confederation).

A sequel to Solo Journey, this album was written after sound checks during Yanni's Ethnicity World Tour. \\"Soft piano to calm, compose, and renew\\". \\"At the beginning of 2003, I embarked on my sixth tour with Yanni traveling 27,000 miles throughout North America. It was remarkable to play arenas in 60 of our country's greatest cities including Madison Square Garden in New York Cityand the Los Angeles Hollywood Bowl. The special audiences and beautiful cities inspired me to compose after sound checks, and I began writing my sixth CD, The Journey Continues. What an inspiration it was for me to sit alone on stage in these grand arenas and compose music.\\" An intermediate piano book for this album was released in 2008. Critical reception Reviewing for Wind and Wire Magazine, Michael Debbage writes, \\"The magical world of movies has a knack for exploring sequels. There is the beauty and beast effect when taking this pathway. The creative beauty allows the viewers to see the continued growth of its characters. The beastly aspect of this exploration is the Hollywood exploitation of an almost guaranteed return on its investment with no regard for its creative progression that usually sees diminishing returns. Bradley Joseph has decided to walk this tightrope by following up with Solo Journey that was released back in 2000. I am glad to report that The Journey Continues is entrenched in beauty, holding up well to its predecessor.\\" The \\"Journey saga\\", are considered to be \\"stripped back and basic\\" by Debbage, with this album featuring \\"Joseph and his piano with no additional clutter\\". \\"There is color in the songs via their understated melodies.\\" In \\"An Ocean Above\\", Joseph once again uses a slower cadence that brings to mind a \\"dancing but gentle ocean washing over your skin\\". One thing Debbage did notice about the album was the heavy use of the upper register of the piano and was pleased to hear a richer more robust sound on \\"In the Heart of Everyone\\" that used the lower keys of the ivory. He also describes \\"A Light From Home\\" as \\"optimistic and lighthearted\\". The confidant \\"Within A Painting\\" has Joseph fluttering on the piano improvising much like his peer Michael Jones. Debbage declared The Journey Continues as one of the top 15 recordings of 2003. \\"There is no doubting that Bradley Joseph holds up the legacy of Solo Journey in fine fashion.

Alms served in the navy from an early age, seeing his first actions in the Mediterranean and off the French coast, before going out to the East Indies. He narrowly survived a shipwreck that claimed most of his shipmates, and returned to England shortly afterwards, having achieved the rank of lieutenant. He was briefly back in the East Indies for service during the early years of the Seven Years' War, before going to the West Indies in acting-command of a frigate. After being involved in a number of important actions in the Caribbean, he returned to Britain after the end of the war, and retired ashore. Returning to active service after the outbreak of the American War of Independence, he went out to the East Indies in command of his own ship. He saw action at most of the engagements between Sir Edward Hughes and the Bailli de Suffren, particularly distinguishing himself at the Battle of Providien. He retired ashore after the end of the war, and died in 1791. Family and early life Alms was born in Gosport, Hampshire on 15 July 1728, the son of John and Mary Alms. His father was said to be a servant of the Duke of Richmond. After a period working in merchant ships he entered the navy in 1740, joining the 74-gun , and by the age of 14 was rated midshipman and serving as aide de camp to Captain Charles Watson, of the 60-gun in the Mediterranean. He saw action at the Battle of Toulon on 22 February 1744 and was praised by his commander for his actions in the engagement. He then joined the 74-gun , serving with Admiral George Anson's fleet off the French coast. Anson's fleet engaged a French one at the First Battle of Cape Finisterre on 14 May 1747, winning a decisive victory and capturing a number of French warships and merchants. Alms remained in Namur, and went out in her in October the following year to the East Indies with Admiral Edward Boscawen. Namur was one of three ship wrecked on the Coromandel coast in a storm on 12 April 1749, with Alms one of just 23 saved from Namur. He was promoted to lieutenant on 14 May 1749 in the aftermath of the disaster, and was assigned to , a frigate returning to England in the spring of 1752. East and West Indies Alms had little interest and unable to get another position, took up the command of the former East Indiaman Hardwick, and spent three or four years trading between Bombay and China. The Hardwick was requisitioned by the government to carry stores in the Carnatic Wars, and was present with his old commander, now Rear- Admiral Sir Charles Watson, at the capture of Gheria on 12‚Äì13 February 1756. In 1758, after the outbreak of the Seven Years' War, Alms returned overland to England and offered his services. He was appointed lieutenant of the 74-gun under Captain James Young, and was present at the Battle of Quiberon Bay on 20 November 1759. Alms continued in Mars for a further two years, and was promoted to master and commander in June 1761. He was made commander of on 10 July 1761, and in November became acting-captain of the 32-gun , which he sailed to the West Indies with Admiral Sir George Pocock's fleet in February 1762, arriving in time to take part in the capture of Martinique. The Battle of Quiberon Bay, Nicholas Pocock, 1812 While cruising in Caribbean waters he captured two armed sloops, one of 18 guns and one of 12 guns. He had further success on 3 June, when while sailing to Havana with the rest of the fleet, he came up on and captured two Spanish vessels, one of 22 guns, and one of 18 guns. The two ships put up a fierce resistance, and in the ensuing engagement several musket balls passed through Alms' hat, and he was wounded in the knee. On arriving at Havana he handed Alarm over to the captain appointed to her, and took up a post as commander of the sloop , moving to command in November that year. He was subsequently heavily involved in the operations to capture Havana, and was on several occasions entrusted with important tasks. Admiral Augustus Keppel said of him that he was an ‚Äòalert, forceful man‚Äô, and he was given the task of carrying the dispatches home, with Keppel's recommendation that he be promoted. However he was not promoted to post-captain until 20 June 1765, after the end of the Seven Years' War. Command Alms spent a number of years ashore after this, living with his family at Chichester. Through the interest of George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax, he was given command of in the Mediterranean in 1770, commanding her for three years. He became captain regulating the impress service for the Sussex district in 1776, but severe asthma prevented him accepting any more active service until September 1780, when he was appointed to command the 64-gun . He went out to the East Indies again with a squadron under Commodore George Johnstone, becoming involved on the way in the Battle of Porto Praya on 16 April 1781, against the Bailli de Suffren. After arriving at the Cape of Good Hope, Johnstone put Alms in command of the reinforcements and East India ships bound for India. Alms struggled with adverse winds and high incidences of sickness, eventually forcing him to leave the troopships on the coast of Arabia in order to bring his warships to reach India in time for the campaigning season. Depiction of the Battle of Trincomalee by Dominic Serres The British fleet rendezvoused with Sir Edward Hughes at Madras on 11 February 1782, and Alms went on to be involved in a number of indecisive clashes between Hughes and the Bailli de Suffren; at Sadras on 17 February, Providien on 12 April, Negapatam on 6 July, and Trincomalee on 3 September 1782. It was at Providien on 12 April 1782 that he particularly distinguished himself. Battle of Providien On the day of the battle Monmouth was second in line to Sir Edward's flagship. At one point in the action, Alms saw that Suffren had put up his helm with a view of boarding Hughes's ship, and luffed his ship into the \\"very eye of the wind,\\" threw into the Frenchman's bows a raking broadside, and frustrated the enemy's plan. Subsequently to this manoeuvre, the Monmouth had to sustain a heavy fire from Suffren and his two seconds, which continued until the main and mizzen- masts of the former fell over the side. The British colours had already been twice shot away, but they were now nailed to the stump of the mizzen-mast, with Alms's direction, \\"never to be struck.\\" In this engagement, the Monmouth had seven guns dismounted,‚Äîthe wheel twice cleared,‚Äîand two seamen only, besides the captain, left alive on the quarter-deck. Forty-five men were killed, and one hundred and two wounded. Alms himself received two splinter- wounds in the face, and two musket-balls went through his hat. His eldest son, George Pigot, who was serving as lieutenant of the Superb, the flagship of Sir Edward Hughes, died early in the action. Death Alms's health broke down over the winter, and he was forced to go ashore at Madras for several months. This marked the end of his active service, and he returned to England, arriving at Spithead in June 1784. Alms retired to his house at Chichester and died there on 8 June 1791 at the age of 64, survived by his wife and five children. His eldest son on his death was a lieutenant aboard , serving Rear- Admiral Sir Richard King, one of Alms's friends from his days in India. Alms was buried at Chichester Cathedral on 14 June 1791.

Biography Dorr E. Felt was born in Beloit, WisconsinFelt and Allied Families, p. 12 (1921) where he grew up on the family farm and which he left at age 14 to seek employment. His father, Eugene K. Felt, was a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly. At 16, \\"his bent of mind, leaning towards mechanics, led him to seek work in a machine shop in Beloit where he found his first employment in the spring of 1878.\\" At 18, he started to learn French and eventually spoke it fluently.Papers in Illinois, p.66 (1922) In early 1882, at age 20, he came to Chicago and worked as foreman of a rolling mill that had a daily output valued at $2,000. In that time he began his work on Comptometer. During the US Thanksgiving holidays of 1884 he decided to build the prototype of a new calculating machine that he had invented. Because of his limited amount of money, he used a macaroni box for the outside box, and skewers, staples and rubber bands for the mechanism inside. It was finished soon after New Year's Day, 1885.J. Turk, p. 55 (1921) Felt brought his idea to Chicago businessman Robert Tarrant. They signed a partnership contract on November 28, 1887, and incorporated the Felt & Tarrant Manufacturing Company on January 25, 1889. Felt later went on to invent more devices and acquired 46 domestic patents and 25 foreign ones. The original macaroni box prototype and the first Comptograph ever sold are now part of the Smithsonian Museum collection of antique calculators.G.C. Chase, p. 223 (1980)J. Turk, p. 119 (1921) He was married to Agnes McNulty in 1891 and the couple had four daughters together. Felt was awarded the John Scott Medal of The Franklin Institute in 1889. Dorr Felt also was the first ambassador for the Department of Commerce formed to study labor abroad after World War I. He was an excellent photographer, and many of his war-time and post-war time photos were used by the government. Dorr traveled the world and loved learning. He made his home in Chicago and summered in Laketown Township, Michigan, where the Dorr E. Felt Mansion is registered on the list of National Historic Places. The Summer Mansion Felt Summer Mansion Dorr was attracted to the pristine beauty of the West Michigan coastline, then known as \\"the Midwest Riviera,\\" and in 1919 purchased several hundred acres on Lake Michigan in the rolling dunes between Holland and Saugatuck, naming his estate \\"Shore Acres Farm.\\" Felt began construction of the \\"Big House\\" in 1925 for his wife, Agnes. This summer home would be large enough to accommodate his married daughters and their families. Completed in 1928, the 12,000+ square foot mansion consists of 25 rooms, including a third-floor ballroom. Unfortunately, Agnes died in August 1928, six weeks after the family moved in, and Dorr died a year and a half later in 1930. The family kept the home until 1949, but after WWII and the advent of more sophisticated calculators, the family sold the business to Victor Calculator, and the Felt descendants decided to sell Shore Acres Farm. In 1949, they held a large auction, selling off many of the items original to the mansion and grounds. Felt Mansion Website Dorr E. Felt died of a stroke in Chicago on August 7, 1930.

He was admitted to the State Bar of California on February 25, 1994. Career and Personal Life Stern's law firm first handled Anna Nicole Smith's modeling contracts in the mid 1990s. Stern met Anna Nicole Smith in 1998, after the death of her husband J. Howard Marshall. When she fought for the Marshall's fortune, Stern presented her direct examination at the trial. Stern's law firm was dissolved around the time he became a co-star on The Anna Nicole Show (2002 - 2004).Who exactly is Howard K. Stern?, People.com, February 09, 2007. Stern maintained an apartment in Santa Monica, California, from which he operated a business called Hot Smoochie Lips, Inc., a talent agency that had Anna Nicole Smith as a client. On September 10, 2006, Stern was with Smith when her son, Daniel Wayne Smith, died in Nassau, Bahamas, while visiting his mother and newborn half-sister Dannielynn. Bahamian Police and the Inquest declared Daniel's death as an accidental overdose on antidepressants and methadone. No foul play was involved.\\"Daniel Smith Death Deemed Accidental, No Charges Coming\\". E!Online.com, March 31, 2008.\\"A Combination of Drug Overdose Killed Daniel Smith.

The ceremony was officiated by a Baptist minister.\\"Anna Nicole Smith weds in the Bahamas\\", hollywood.com; accessed March 16, 2017. Smith died on February 8, 2007, less than five months after Daniel. According to the Florida court overseeing her estate, Smith left everything to Daniel in a 16-page will that named Stern as executor of the Estate. On February 21, 2007, hearings commenced in Florida's Broward County Circuit Court over the disposition of Smith's remains. Denying motions by Smith's mother and Stern, judge awarded custody of Smith's body to her infant daughter, Dannielynn Hope Marshall Stern via attorney whom judge appointed the baby's guardian ad litem. Smith was buried next to Daniel in the Bahamas. Paternity dispute On September 26, 2006, Stern claimed in an interview with Larry King on CNN that he was Dannielynn's father; celebrity photographer Larry Birkhead also claimed that he was Dannielynn's father. The Bahamian birth certificate lists the daughter's name as Dannielynn Hope Marshall Stern with Howard K. Stern as the father. On February 9, 2007, following Anna Nicole Smith's death, it was revealed that Stern had custody of Smith's child, Dannielynn. Fr√©d√©ric Prinz von Anhalt, the husband of the actress Zsa Zsa Gabor alleged he could be the father of Smith's daughter and threatened to file a lawsuit for custody. On April 10, 2007, a Bahamian court determined from DNA evidence presented by court-appointed DNA expert that Larry Birkhead is the father of Dannielynn. Stern announced that he would not contest the ruling and would help Birkhead obtain sole custody. Prosecution for conspiracy On March 13, 2009, the California Attorney General and Los Angeles County District Attorney announced that they would be charging Stern, Dr. Sandeep Kapoor and Dr. Khristine Eroshevich of conspiring to \\"commit the crimes of prescribing, administering and dispensing controlled substances to an addict.\\" They were not accused of causing Smith's death in 2007.

Journalist Rita Cosby alleged in her book, Blonde Ambition: The Untold Story Behind Anna Nicole Smith's Death, released on September 4, 2007, that Smith's nannies revealed that a sex tape existed of Stern and former rival Larry Birkhead engaged in a homosexual relationship. However, a lawyer for the nannies threatened to file suit, claiming that the nannies never spoke about such an encounter between Stern and Birkhead. After Stern filed a $60-million libel suit against Cosby and her publisher in October 2007, a spokesperson for the nannies claimed Cosby had offered bribes in an unsuccessful attempt to contact the nannies. In July 2009, in a court hearing on whether to dismiss the lawsuit, Stern's attorney claimed that in deposition of the suits, Cosby admitted there was no videotape and could not prove other allegations.

The term \\"hot\\" refers to the effective temperature used to model carrier density, not to the overall temperature of the device. Since the charge carriers can become trapped in the gate dielectric of a MOS transistor, the switching characteristics of the transistor can be permanently changed. Hot-carrier injection is one of the mechanisms that adversely affects the reliability of semiconductors of solid- state devices.  Physics  The term ‚Äúhot carrier injection‚Äù usually refers to the effect in MOSFETs, where a carrier is injected from the conducting channel in the silicon substrate to the gate dielectric, which usually is made of silicon dioxide (SiO2). To become ‚Äúhot‚Äù and enter the conduction band of SiO2, an electron must gain a kinetic energy of ~3.2 eV. For holes, the valence band offset in this case dictates they must have a kinetic energy of 4.6 eV. The term \\"hot electron\\" comes from the effective temperature term used when modelling carrier density (i.e., with a Fermi-Dirac function) and does not refer to the bulk temperature of the semiconductor (which can be physically cold, although the warmer it is, the higher the population of hot electrons it will contain all else being equal). The term ‚Äúhot electron‚Äù was originally introduced to describe non-equilibrium electrons (or holes) in semiconductors.Conwell, E. M., High Field Transport in Semiconductors, Solid State Physics Supplement 9 (Academic Press, New York, 1967). More broadly, the term describes electron distributions describable by the Fermi function, but with an elevated effective temperature. This greater energy affects the mobility of charge carriers and as a consequence affects how they travel through a semiconductor device. Hot electrons can tunnel out of the semiconductor material, instead of recombining with a hole or being conducted through the material to a collector. Consequent effects include increased leakage current and possible damage to the encasing dielectric material if the hot carrier disrupts the atomic structure of the dielectric. Hot electrons can be created when a high-energy photon of electromagnetic radiation (such as light) strikes a semiconductor. The energy from the photon can be transferred to an electron, exciting the electron out of the valence band, and forming an electron-hole pair. If the electron receives enough energy to leave the valence band, and to surpass the conduction band, it becomes a hot electron. Such electrons are characterized by high effective temperatures. Because of the high effective temperatures, hot electrons are very mobile, and likely to leave the semiconductor and travel into other surrounding materials. In some semiconductor devices, the energy dissipated by hot electron phonons represents an inefficiency as energy is lost as heat. For instance, some solar cells rely on the photovoltaic properties of semiconductors to convert light to electricity. In such cells, the hot electron effect is the reason that a portion of the light energy is lost to heat rather than converted to electricity. Hot electrons arise generically at low temperatures even in degenerate semiconductors or metals. There are a number of models to describe the hot-electron effect. The simplest predicts an electron-phonon (e-p) interaction based on a clean three-dimensional free-electron model. Hot electron effect models illustrate a correlation between power dissipated, the electron gas temperature and overheating.  Effects on transistors In MOSFETs, hot electrons have sufficient energy to tunnel through the thin oxide gate to show up as gate current, or as substrate leakage current. The hot electrons may jump from the channel region or from the drain, for instance, and into the gate or the substrate. For instance, in a MOSFET, when a gate is positive, and the switch is on, the device is designed with the intent that electrons will flow through the conductive channel to the drain. These hot electrons do not contribute to the amount of current flowing through the channel as intended and instead are a leakage current. Attempts to correct or compensate for the hot electron effect in a MOSFET may involve locating a diode in reverse bias at gate terminal or other manipulations of the device (such as lightly doped drains or double-doped drains). When electrons are accelerated in the channel, they gain energy along the mean free path. This energy is lost in two different ways: #The carrier hits an atom in the substrate. Then the collision creates a cold carrier and an additional electron-hole pair. In the case of nMOS transistors, additional electrons are collected by the channel and additional holes are evacuated by the substrate. #The carrier hits a Si-H bond and break the bond. An interface state is created and the hydrogen atom is released in the substrate. The probability to hit either an atom or a Si-H bond is random, and the average energy involved in each process is the same in both case. This is the reason why the substrate current is monitored during HCI stress. A high substrate current means a large number of created electron-hole pairs and thus an efficient Si-H bond breakage mechanism. When interface states are created, the threshold voltage is modified and the subthreshold slope is degraded. This leads to lower current, and degrades the operating frequency of integrated circuit.  Scaling  Advances in semiconductor manufacturing techniques and ever increasing demand for faster and more complex integrated circuits (ICs) have driven the associated Metal‚ÄìOxide‚ÄìSemiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) to scale to smaller dimensions. However, it has not been possible to scale the supply voltage used to operate these ICs proportionately due to factors such as compatibility with previous generation circuits, noise margin, power and delay requirements, and non-scaling of threshold voltage, subthreshold slope, and parasitic capacitance. As a result, internal electric fields increase in aggressively scaled MOSFETs, which comes with the additional benefit of increased carrier velocities (up to velocity saturation), and hence increased switching speed,Richard C. Dorf (ed) The Electrical Engineering Handbook, CRC Press, 1993 page 578 but also presents a major reliability problem for the long term operation of these devices, as high fields induce hot carrier injection which affects device reliability. Large electric fields in MOSFETs imply the presence of high-energy carriers, referred to as ‚Äúhot carriers‚Äù. These hot carriers that have sufficiently high energies and momenta to allow them to be injected from the semiconductor into the surrounding dielectric films such as the gate and sidewall oxides as well as the buried oxide in the case of silicon on insulator (SOI) MOSFETs.  Reliability impact  The presence of such mobile carriers in the oxides triggers numerous physical damage processes that can drastically change the device characteristics over prolonged periods. The accumulation of damage can eventually cause the circuit to fail as key parameters such as threshold voltage shift due to such damage. The accumulation of damage resulting degradation in device behavior due to hot carrier injection is called ‚Äúhot carrier degradation‚Äù. The useful life-time of circuits and integrated circuits based on such a MOS device are thus affected by the life-time of the MOS device itself. To assure that integrated circuits manufactured with minimal geometry devices will not have their useful life impaired, the life-time of the component MOS devices must have their HCI degradation well understood. Failure to accurately characterize HCI life-time effects can ultimately affect business costs such as warranty and support costs and impact marketing and sales promises for a foundry or IC manufacturer.  Relationship to radiation effects  Hot carrier degradation is fundamentally the same as the ionization radiation effect known as the total dose damage to semiconductors, as experienced in space systems due to solar proton, electron, X-ray and gamma ray exposure.  HCI and NOR flash memory cells  HCI is the basis of operation for a number of non-volatile memory technologies such as EPROM cells. As soon as the potential detrimental influence of HC injection on the circuit reliability was recognized, several fabrication strategies were devised to reduce it without compromising the circuit performance. NOR flash memory exploits the principle of hot carriers injection by deliberately injecting carriers across the gate oxide to charge the floating gate. This charge alters the MOS transistor threshold voltage to represent a logic '0' state. An uncharged floating gate represents a '1' state. Erasing the NOR Flash memory cell removes stored charge through the process of Fowler‚ÄìNordheim tunneling. Because of the damage to the oxide caused by normal NOR Flash operation, HCI damage is one of the factors that cause the number of write-erase cycles to be limited. Because the ability to hold charge and the formation of damage traps in the oxide affects the ability to have distinct '1' and '0' charge states, HCI damage results in the closing of the non-volatile memory logic margin window over time. The number of write- erase cycles at which '1' and '0' can no longer be distinguished defines the endurance of a non-volatile memory.

Biography Silva Porto was born to a poor family in Porto in continental Portugal; he was the son of humble parents, but whose father distinguished himself in battles against the French during their invasion in 1810. Instead of following his father into the military, the intelligent and ambitious boy looked to economic possibilities farther afield. Brazil was an obvious possibility, owing to the success of many emigrants; at the age of twelve, with his father's blessing, he emigrated to the Brazilian capital of Rio de Janeiro on board the brig Rio Ave. After working for a while for a merchant he became indignant with his remuneration and quits, taking several itinerant jobs. At 18 years of age he landed in Bahia, where he made a point of announcing to the newspaper Correio Mercantil his new name, in order to remove any confusion with another Ant√≥nio Ferreira da Silva. He did this to pay homage to his hometown as well. In Bahia he continued to work as a sales clerk for a coffee merchant but continued to be exploited by his boss and frustrated by the \\"despotism of proprietors without scruples\\". West African merchant One day, at the Port of Bahia, he boarded a ship to Luanda, \\"without even knowing where Angola was\\" as he would state later in life. However, initially, Luanda did not fascinate him much, and after a short time, he returned to Bahia where the political climate was heating up. During the \\"Sabino Revolt\\", an autonomist uprising in the State of Bahia that occurred between 6 November 1837 and 16 March 1838, Silva Porto understood that this political instability would hamper business prospects, and decided to return to Angola, where he employed in a local tavern. Slowly, he becomes captivated with the interior of the African continent, and with his first salaries, he buys handicrafts and linens. Once he was confident of the quantity of mercantile goods in his possession, he quit his job to begin his 50-year career as a merchant in the interior. He is only 22 years old. This was a difficult adventure: many of the caravans that left the Benguela coast for Lui, Luanda and Katanga risked robbery, pillaging and negotiating styles of the local chiefs. There was always risk of wandering into tribal conflicts. Silva Porto developed many friendships in the interior with tribesmen and quickly adapted to the conditions in Africa, adapting indigenous agricultural techniques and married a prominent black woman from the Bi√© kingdom of the Ovimbundu people, and he fathering several mixed-race children with her. By 1838, he had opened a shop in the interior of Luanda. Then by 1845, he descended to Benguela, establishing a route for his business along the road to Lui, by way of Lutembo and the upper Zambezi. He eventually established his headquarters in Belmonte, beginning his exploration of the region of Barotseland.Silva Porto, 1986, p.23 His shop was a center of intense activity and commerce; he sold his textiles, small porcelain objects and explosives bought and traded ivory, honey and rubber from the interior, which he meticulously recorded in his journals. These tomes (14 volumes in all) contained varied descriptions of geography, ethnography and anthropology of his region of Africa, which his old friend Luciano Cordeiro referred to as a \\"conversation on paper\\". Cordeiro would add, \\"with his tight and tortuous writing, which reminds me of zigzags across the mountain forests, in his at times, almost-Creole language owing to his isolation in the wilderness, in which he passed many hours writing silently\\". Eventually, Silva Porto's journals were published in the \\"Annals of the Ultramarine Counsel\\". Silva Porto would once affirm, \\"If my work was what it was, there would be much published, and probably in many languages\\". In 1848, he was appointed interim Captain-major of Bi√©. He set out to quiet relations between the indigenous and Europeans; he met with the colonial Europeans to unite them and to persuade the local chief, Lhiumbulla, to stop detaining colonists (a fact that merchant Europeans continued to do for petty reasons). However, his attempts were an impossibility when the chief died, forcing Silva Porto to ask the colonial administration for a military force to protect Portuguese interests. After 1854 his activity was incessant, and by 1869 he had made six voyages to Lui and three to Benguela, where he would purchase the local shop Bemposta and remained sedentary, until 1879 when he returned to Belmonte. By 62 years of age, he was once again crossing Western Africa: he traveled to Moio (Kuba) in 1880 and 1882, to Lui (Barotseland) in 1883, and then to Benguela in 1882 and 1884. His activities were interrupted by a return trip to Lisbon for eye surgery during the winter and spring of 1885. When he returned he continued to trek his products across the interior, this time to Calunda and Benguela (by the end of 1887). When in Belmonte he helped the local mission, providing from his own money for school supplies, food and clothing for their children and remuneration for the teacher. On 5 March 1889, he was substituted by Justino Teixeira da Silva as Captain-major of Bi√©, but continued to receive his 100,000 reis per month and the associated honors. The value of the 100$000 he earned was 20 gold 5$000 coins. These Portuguese gold coins had the same purity of 91.7% of the English Sovereign gold coins, but were 10.8% heavier.

Around 1850, Portuguese exploration of Africa expanded, but Silva Porto's request for a military occupation force was never heard: at that time, Portugal was only interested in developing and colonizing the coast. In Belmonte, the most eastern Portuguese vanguard, Silva Porto experimented with exploring areas of the interior. He was a self-styled diplomat between the Portuguese colonists and the native tribes of the Ovimbundu, as well as a merchant and explorer. He frequently crossed the interior in caravans selling goods, as well as participating in field projects to document the ethnography and geography of the interior of the Portuguese West Africa. For many years, Silva Porto was the only white man that natives in Portuguese West Africa would see; he established himself in Bi√© and established a local business to serve the locals, settlers and support Portuguese forces. In addition, he presented his services to David Livingstone, Henry Morton Stanley, Hermenegildo Capelo, Roberto Ivens and Alexandre de Serpa Pinto by relating his knowledge of native customs and identifying local indigenous which he had established good relations. Supposedly, Livingstone, was unimpressed with the Portuguese settler, referring to him as a \\"vulgar negrito\\" when he arrived in the lands of the Upper Zambezi. At one point, Silva Porto housed the explorer, David Livingstone, and he helped Livingstone find an overland route between Luanda and certain places in the Angolan interior. Neither one of them seemed to like the other. Further, in his journals, he referred to the two Portuguese that he encountered (Silva Porto and Caetano Ferreira) as \\"mulattoes or uncivilized black savages\\", omitting the fact that Silva Porto had helped and supplied him with valuable information, and accused Silva Porto of being nothing more than an ordinary slave trader. In 1889, after a visit to another village, Silva Porto returned to Belmonte to find his home burned-down. He wrote his friend Luciano Cordeiro, \\"I am an invalid and poor. I have no bread and look to the supreme consolation...to die in the Fatherland\\". In 1877, the Geographic Society had made an appeal to an entitlement for the merchant/explorer (specifically a pension), in order to support his desire to return to Portugal, where he could \\"die in the Fatherland which he had honorably and dedicatedly served\\".Vasco Pulido Valente, 2001, p.771 Death However, the 1890 British Ultimatum and the loss of the confidence brought on by chief Dunduna would drive him into despair. Paiva Couceiro arrived in the area of Teixeira da Silva around January 1890, with a contingent of 40 Mozambican soldiers, armed with Snider-Enfield breech-loading rifles, which worried the chief of Bi√©. Fearing that the Portuguese were there to construct a fort and occupy his lands, the chief was convinced by Silva Porto that the troops were only passing through the area on the way to Barotseland, and that they would not remain there for long. Nevertheless, Paiva Couceiro remained in the area until April, at which the chief (encouraged by threats to the Portuguese by the English) decided to send an ultimatum to the Captain-major in Teixeira da Silva: Couceiro and his troops should leave Bi√© by the morning of the following day. Indignant about the chief's demands, he sent Silva Porto to the village to negotiate an understanding. Believing he had some influence with the chief, he attempted to resolve the tensions, but was disappointed to realize he had little power: he returned despondent, likely learning that the British Ultimatum had reduced Portuguese influence. During Silva Porto's confrontation with Dunduna, the chief even tugged on his white beard; Dunduna was indignant over not being advised of the Paiva Couceiro's intentions and affirmed that Silva Porto was without character and insulted that he should wear beard, a symbol to him of respect. Returning to Teixeira da Silva, he asked about the certainty of the Ultimatum, which irritated Paiva Couceiro. But later, in Belmonte, Silva Porto was in good spirits, although Paiva Couceiro did notice that his compound had barrels of gunpowder (which he, laughing, brushed-off as full of sand). On April 1, 1890, the explorer wrapped himself in a Portuguese flag, lay down on a dozen kegs of gunpowder, and lit a fuse. He did not die immediately, but the burns from the self-inflicted injury killed him the next day. He was seventy-two. Honours Angolan escudo note depicting Ant√≥nio Silva Porto. The town of Kuito, founded by the Portuguese and named Belmonte at that time, was renamed Silva Porto.Silva Porto: do Brasil a √ÅfricaKuito nasceu em Belmonte In 1962‚Äì63, the Angolan Yearbook, which glorified its original colonizer, referred to the town as follows: :\\"The city of Silva Porto has a graceful aspect and the roads well marked and for the most part recently asphalted, it is electrified and watered, with a radio station and swimming pools for water sports. In the city there was recently erected a bronze statue , with 3.6 meter height, in honor if this great Portuguese...there are 2300 Europeans, 1900 mesti√ßos and less than 400,000 natives\\". The name remained until Angola's independence in 1975. Today its importance has been bypassed, and the population was diminished substantially.

Nino was raised in the Tsinandali palace, eastern Georgia, where her father was writing his historical novels and poetry. When Nino turned sixteen, she met Russian poet and novelist Alexander Griboyedov during one of her father's parties in Tiflis. Griboyedov proposed to her soon after the meeting and they married at Tbilisi Sioni Cathedral on August 22, 1828. Later in the same year, she accompanied her husband on his fatal mission to Persia, but Nino became ill and Griboyedov chose to leave her in Tabriz. After hearing of her husband‚Äôs death in Teheran (January 30, 1829), Nino gave birth to a premature child, who died soon after. Pursuant to Griboyedov's will, Nino reburied him to Mount Mtatsminda, Tbilisi, and ordered a grave stone with the inscription in Russian: \\"Your spirit and achievements will be remembered for ever. Why still does my love outlive you?\\"David M. Lang (1990). Georgia in 1840: The Lister Diaries.

She never remarried, rejecting her numerous suitors (including the prominent Georgian poet and military commander, Grigol Orbeliani, who, inspired with hopeless passion towards Nino for thirty years, also never married) and winning universal admiration for her fidelity to his memory. She spent most of her unhappy life in the Tsinandali residence, frequently visiting Tiflis and her sister, Ekaterine, in Mingrelia. Nino died in 1857, and was buried next to Griboyedov. On the burial stone of Alexandr Griboyedov at the Mtatsminda Pantheon in Tbilisi, the statue of Nino is depicted weeping over the death of her beloved husband.

Special education In December 2013, the Bloomsburg Area School District administration reported that 190 pupils or 11.3% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 42.6% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2012, the District administration reported that 233 pupils or 13.5% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 47.6% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. Special education services in the Commonwealth are provided to students from ages three years to 21 years old. In the 2010-2011 school year, the total student enrollment was more than 1.78 million students with approximately 275,000 students eligible for special education services. Among these students 18,959 were identified with mental retardation and 21,245 students with autism.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Testimony Hearing on Special Education Senate Republican Policy Committee, January 2013 The largest group of students are identified as Specific Learning Disabilities 126,026 students (46.9 percent) and Speech or Language Impairments with 43,542 students (16.2 percent). In December 2011, Bloomsburg Area School District administration reported that 240 pupils or 14% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 52% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2010, the district administration reported that 282 pupils or 15.7% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. In December 2008, the District administration reported that 261 pupils or 15.9% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 60% of its identified students having specific learning disabilities. In 2007, Pennsylvania Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak testified before the Pennsylvania House Education Committee regarding full day kindergarten. He claimed that districts which offered the program would see a significant decrease in special education students due to early identification and early intervention. He asserted the high cost of full day kindergarten would be recouped by Districts in lower special education costs. Bloomsburg Area School District has provided full day kindergarten since 2003. The District has seen a slight decrease in the percentage of special education students it serves, but this has yielding no savings. In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the district's Special Education Department. The IDEA 2004 requires each school entity to publish a notice to parents, in newspapers or other media, including the student handbook and website regarding the availability of screening and intervention services and how to access them. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Senator Patrick Browne Committee Chairperson, Senate Education Committee Holds Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability, November 1, 2011 The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Pennsylvania Department of Education Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, November 11, 2011 Overidentification of students in order to increase state funding has been an issue in the Commonwealth.

For the 2010-11, 2011‚Äì12, 2012‚Äì13 and 2013-14 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. In 2014, Bloomsburg Area School District received an increase to $943,147 from the Commonwealth for special education funding.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Special Education funding report by LEA, July 2014 Additionally, the state provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students.

The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Wellness policy Bloomsburg Area School Board established a district wellness policy in 2006 ‚Äì Policy 246. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts are required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the School Nutrition Incentive, Pennsylvania Department of Education ‚Äì Division of Food and Nutrition. July 2008 The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. The District offers a free school breakfast and free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In 2014, President Barack Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The US Department of Agriculture requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. Bloomsburg Area School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in each building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. In 2016, the Pennsylvania Department of Health made available to each Pennsylvania high school, including Bloomsburg Area High School, the overdose antidote drug naloxone in a nasal spray. School nurses were also provided with educational materials and training developed by the National Association of School Nurses. The cost was covered by a grant from a private foundation. Highmark Healthy High 5 grant In 2011, the schools in Bloomsburg Area School District received $10,000 in grant funding through a Highmark Healthy High 5 grant. There funds were used to purchase equipment to complement the existing physical education curriculum and to be able to monitor heart rates and evaluate through fitnessgram testing.Highmark Foundation, 2011 School Challenge Grants, 2011 Beginning in 2006, Highmark Foundation engaged in a 5-year, $100 million program to promote lifelong healthy behaviors in children and adolescents through local nonprofits and schools.

It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the Bloomsburg Area School District's schools. The 2012 tuition rates are Elementary School - $7,761, High School - $8,755. Bloomsburg Area School District is funded by a combination of: a local earned income tax of 1.56% (among the highest in the Commonwealth), a property tax, an Occupation Privilege tax - $10, 2 per capita taxes of $5 each per year, annual local services tax (LST) $52 for Bloomsburg, Hemlock Township, Montour Township, LST $10 for Beaver Township, Catawissa Township, Main Township, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government.

Real estate taxes Property tax rates in 2016-17 were again raised by the school board at 401.8000 mills.Bloomsburg Area School Board, Bloomsburg Area School District Budget Report 2016-17, 2016 A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the Commonwealth, as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. *2015-16 - 40.0000 mills *2014-15 - 39.7000 mills *2013-14 - 39.7000 mills *2012-13 - 38.9000 millsPennsylvania Department of Education, Finances_Real Estate Tax Rates 2012-13, 2012 *2011-12 - 38.1000 mills *2010-11 - 37.5000 mills *2009-10 - 36.2000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports, 2010 *2008-09 - 36.2000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports 2008-09 Real Estate Mills, 2009 *2007-08 - 36.2000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2008 *2006-07 - 35.1000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2006 *2005-06 - 33.5000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 The average yearly property tax paid by Columbia County residents amounts to about 2.72% of their yearly income. Columbia County is ranked 776th of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income.Columbia County Property Taxes 2012, Tax- rates.org, 2012 Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%). According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999-00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008-09. Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but it can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increasing rising health care costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of 0.75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten the exceptions to the Index. The following exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the index in the school's share of payments to PSERS taking into account on the PSERS contribution rate.

Enrollment and Consolidation The enrollment at Bloomsburg Area School District is projected to decline significantly by 2019. In 2012, enrollment was 1,629 pupils. Standard and Poors study found that an optimal school district size, to conserve administrative costs, was 3000 pupils. Consolidation of administrations with an adjacent school district would achieve substantial administrative cost savings for people in both communities. According to a 2009 proposal by Governor Edward Rendell, the excessive administrative overhead dollars could be redirected to improving high school student academic achievement, enriching the curriculum programs or to reducing local property taxes. Pennsylvania Department of Education data shows that from 1999‚Äì2000 to 2008‚Äì09 there has been a 12 percent increase in public school staff even as there was a 1 percent decline in public school enrollment. Pennsylvania schools added 17,345 professional employees and 15,582 support workers over this time, while enrollment declined by 26,960.Pennsylvania Department of Education Enrollment data and Public School Staffing data. Total public school enrollment in 2009 was 1,787,351 pupils. Consolidation of two central administrations into one would not require the closing of any local schools. The Governor's proposal called for the savings to be redirected to improving lagging reading and science achievement, to enriching the academic programs or to reducing residents' property taxes. In March 2011, the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants Fiscal Responsibility Task Force released a report which found that consolidating school district administrations with one neighboring district would save the Commonwealth $1.2 billion without forcing the consolidation/closing of any schools. Pennsylvania has one of the highest numbers of public school districts in the nation. In Pennsylvania, 80% of the school districts serve student populations under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. This results in excessive school administration bureaucracy and not enough course diversity.Rendell, E. & Soderberg, M. (2009).

Columbia County's live birth rate was 720 births in 1990. In 2000, Columbia County's live birth rate declined to 614 births while in 2011, the birth rate was 620 babies.Pennsylvania Department of Health, Birth Age County Reports 1990 and 2011, 2011 Over the past 50 years (1960 to 2010), rural Pennsylvania saw a steady decline in both the number and proportion of residents under 18 years old.

History Originally, the proposed name for the station was the 76 Avenue Station; however both the Belgravia Community League and the McKernan Community League wanted the name to reflect their communities. After much discussion by the McKernan Community League Historian, Ed Stover, City Council voted to change the name to McKernan/Belgravia in October 2006. The station was officially opened on April 25, 2009, with regular service commencing on April 26, 2009. McKernan/Belgravia is one of only six stations that have never been the terminus of the LRT system.The other five are Coliseum, Stadium, Churchill, Bay/Enterprise Square, and Southgate stations. Station Layout The station has a 123 metre long centre loading platform that can accommodate two five-car trains at the same time, one on each side of the platform. The platform is six metres wide, narrow by current Edmonton LRT design guidelines. A pedestrian underpass, included as part of the station design, allows passengers and other pedestrian traffic to easily cross 114 Street and connects the McKernan and Belgravia neighbourhoods.

Soth makes \\"large-scale American projects\\" featuring the midwestern United States. New York Times art critic Hilarie M. Sheets wrote that he has made a \\"photographic career out of finding chemistry with strangers\\" and photographs \\"loners and dreamers\\". His work tends to focus on the \\"off-beat, hauntingly banal images of modern America\\" according to The Guardian art critic Hannah Booth. He is a member of Magnum Photos. Soth has had various books of his work published by major publishers as well as self-published through his own Little Brown Mushroom. His major publications are Sleeping by the Mississippi, Niagara, Broken Manual, Songbook, and I Know How Furiously Your Heart Is Beating. He has received fellowships from the McKnight and Jerome Foundations and was the recipient of the 2003 Santa Fe Prize for Photography. His photographs are in major public and private collections, including the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of Fine Arts Houston, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, and the Walker Art Center. His work has been exhibited widely including as part of the 2004 Whitney Biennial and a major solo exhibition at Media Space in London in 2015. Life and work Soth was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. He studied at Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, New York. He was reported to be \\"painfully shy\\" in his youth. Soth liked the work of Diane Arbus. He traveled around the Mississippi River and made a self-printed book entitled Sleeping by the Mississippi which included both landscapes and portraits. Curators for the 2004 Whitney Biennial put him in their show, and one of his photographs entitled \\"Charles\\", of a man in a flight suit on his roof holding two model airplanes, was used in their poster. When he photographs people, Soth feels nervous at times. He said: \\"My own awkwardness comforts people, I think. It‚Äôs part of the exchange.\\" When he was on the road, he'd have notes describing types of pictures he wanted taped to the steering wheel of his car. One list was: \\"beards, birdwatchers, mushroom hunters, men‚Äôs retreats, after the rain, figures from behind, suitcases, tall people (especially skinny), targets, tents, treehouses and tree lines. With people, he'll ask their permission to photograph them, and often wait for them to get comfortable; he sometimes uses an 8x10 camera. He tries to find a \\"narrative arc and true storytelling\\" and pictures in which each picture will lead to the next one. His first book, Sleeping by the Mississippi, was published in 2004. His second book, Niagara, was published in 2006. One of his photos is of a woman in a bridal gown sitting outside what appears to be a motel; he describes having made an arrangement with a particular wedding chapel in Niagara Falls which let him take pictures of couples getting married, by photographing them after their weddings. Soth made several more photographic books including Last Days of W, a book about a country \\"exhausted by George W. Bush's presidency\\". He has photographed for The New York Times Magazine, Fortune and Newsweek. Soth, using the pseudonym Lester B. Morrison, created Broken Manual over four years (2006‚Äì2010) an underground instruction manual for those looking to escape their lives. Soth investigates the places in which people retreat to escape civilization, he photographs monks, survivalists, hermits and runaways. He concurrently produced the photo book From Here to There: Alec Soth‚Äôs America an overview of Soth‚Äôs photography from the early 1990s to the present. Soth founded the publishing house, Little Brown Mushroom (LBM), in 2010. Through it, he publishes his own, and that of other like-minded people, \\"narrative photography books that function in a similar way to children's books,\\" in book, magazine and newspaper formats. He has collaborated on numerous books with Brad Zellar, a Minnesota writer from the Twin Cities. In 2010, Soth flew to the United Kingdom but despite not having applied for a work visa was allowed into the country on the understanding that if he was \\"caught taking photographs\\" he could be put in prison for two years. So he handed the camera to his young daughter who took pictures in Brighton. A 2016 photo exhibition, titled Hypnagogia, featured 30 images from Soth's 20-year exploration of the state between wakefulness and sleep. ‚ÄúDescribed as a neurological phenomenon, one recurrently associated with creativity, a hypnagogic state is the dreamlike experience while awake that conjures vivid, sometimes realistic imagery,‚Äù Soth explained in the artist statement for the project. In 2004, he became a nominee of the Magnum Photos agency and in 2008 became a full member. He lives with his wife and children in Minneapolis. His work has been compared to that of Walker Evans and Stephen Shore. Publications Publications by Soth * Sleeping by the Mississippi.

It is believed that Guy relocated to the sister colony of Bristol's Hope when it was established in 1618. Sometime before 1630 Guy had moved again to Carbonear to fish, farm, and trap furs, on land belonging to Sir Percival Willoughby. A letter written by Guy to Willoughby on September 1, 1631Middleton Manuscript, Mi x 1/57, University of Nottingham indicates that Guy had become Willoughby's agent in the development of his land, which consisted of the northern part of the peninsula between Conception and Trinity bays. The Guy family remained the predominant planter family in Carbonear throughout the seventeenth century. The 1677 census lists both Jonathan Guy (probably Nicholas‚Äôs son) and Nicholas Guy (likely Jonathan‚Äôs son) living there with their families. Jonathan owned, among other things, four dwelling houses, two boats and a vegetable garden and kept seven head of cattle, eleven sheep and 3 hogs. Nicholas had one dwelling house and two boats and kept six head of cattle and 4 hogs. Although unproven, it is likely Guy was a close relative of John Guy, the first Governor of Newfoundland.

In 1780, he founded the first settlement in Shelby County, Kentucky. The tenth of eleven children, Squire Boone was born to Squire Boone Sr. and his wife Sarah (Morgan) Boone in Berks County, Pennsylvania, at the Daniel Boone Homestead. Although overshadowed by his famous brother, Squire Boone was well known in his day. Early life Squire Boone Jr. was born in Berks County, Pennsylvania, on October 5, 1744, the son of Squire Boone Sr. and Sarah Jarman Morgan. In 1749, he along with his family moved to Rowan County, North Carolina,The Boone Society - Profile of Squire Boone and lived in the Yadkin Valley. In 1759, aged 15, he was sent back to Pennsylvania to apprentice as a gunsmith under his cousin Samuel Boone. After five years of apprenticeship, he returned to North Carolina. On August 8, 1765, he married Jane Van Cleave, who was of Dutch heritage. Together, the couple had five children.Kleber, p. 99 Life in Kentucky From 1767 to 1771, he went on several long hunts, with his brother, Daniel, into the Kentucky wilderness. In 1775, Richard Henderson, a prominent judge from North Carolina, hired Daniel Boone to blaze what became known as the Wilderness Road, which went through the Cumberland Gap and into central Kentucky. Squire Boone accompanied his brother and 30 others, assisting in the settlement of Boone's Station (present-day Boonesborough). In Spring 1779, after the siege of Boonesborough, where Squire had a rifle ball cut out of his shoulder, he moved his family to the settlement at the Falls of the Ohio that would become Louisville. In 1780, he brought 13 families to \\"Painted Stone\\", a tract of land in Shelby County, and established Squire Boone's Station there, the first permanent settlement in the county. He was wounded in April 1781 when Indians attacked the fort; complications of the gunshot injury would result in his right arm being an inch and a half shorter than his left. On September 13, 1781, the settlers abandoned the undermanned station and headed for nearby Linn's Station. Since Squire Boone was still too weak from his injury to make the trip, he stayed behind at the station with his family and one other. The fleeing settlers were attacked in what became known as the Long Run Massacre. In 1782, he began acting as a land locator for wealthy land speculators who did not want to personally risk living on the frontier. However, due to financial losses in this line of work, he lost his own property, including the station, in 1786 and was forced to settle elsewhere in the county. He served two terms in the Virginia legislature in 1789 and 1790 and was the primary sponsor of a bill to charter the town of Louisville. Life in Indiana After attempting to establish a settlement near present-day Vicksburg, Mississippi, and staying with his brother Daniel in Missouri for several years, he eventually settled with his family in Harrison County, Indiana, south of Corydon .In 1804 according to The Boone Society but in 1802 according to The History of Indiana. There, he settled with his four sons and the sons of Samuel Boone. The settlement is in what is now called Boone Township, and it began to flourish early on. Squire Boone personally acquired a large tract of land on the western edge of the township near the cave he and his brother had hid in many years earlier to evade Indians. Boone considered the cave to be sacred and decided that was where he wanted to be entombed. On his land, Boone carved stone out of a nearby hill to build his home. He carved into the quarry wall various religious and political statements that are still there today. Boone would also build Old Goshen Church, one of the first churches in the state. Boone also became a close friend of Harvey Heth and involved in the local politics of the area as one of the leading citizens. He was Harrison County's Justice of the peace in 1808.Indiana and Indianians, 1919, Pg 299 Death Squire Boone died of congestive heart failure, at age 70, on August 5, 1815 and was buried in a cave on his property. His remains were left undisturbed for many years, but in the mid-20th century relic hunters began taking parts of his coffin and even some of his bones. In 1973, his remains were removed from a small pit cave on the property and placed into a new coffin built by employees of the cave and placed inside the commercial cave, where it resides today, at the end of the tour of Squire Boone Caverns.

From 1994 to 1999 its activities received considerable funding by the Pioneer Fund.Perry, Barbara, Hate Crimes. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 112 On June 29, 2020, American Renaissance's YouTube channel and AmRen Podcasts were banned from YouTube for violations of hate speech guidelines. Taylor advocates segregation as a natural expression of racial solidarity while denying that his views constitute white supremacy. Viewing societal problems as racial in nature, Taylor upholds white racial homogeneity as the key to peaceful coexistence with other races. He sees Japan as an exemplar of a racially homogeneous society. Taylor is a self-styled \\"race realist\\" who draws attention to scientific research indicating genetic differences in, inter alia, mean IQ scores between races. He attributes much of the racial disparity (e.g. between blacks and whites) in socioeconomic outcomes to these underlying \\"phenotypic\\" differences, and notes that East Asians, who score higher on IQ tests and have greater mean educational attainment than whites, commit correspondingly fewer crimes and earn higher incomes. Regarding Jews, the ADL writes that \\"Taylor eschews anti-Semitism. Seeing Jews as white, greatly influential and the \\"conscience of society,\\" Taylor rather seeks to partner with Jews who share his views on race and racial diversity\\" and \\"Jews have been speakers and/or participants at all eight American Renaissance conferences\\" although controversy followed accusations by David Duke, who was not a scheduled presenter, at the 2006 conference. The Color of Crime The Color of Crime is a publication by Jared Taylor that describes race differences in criminal delinquency in the United States. It was published as a monograph in 1999 and as revised editions in electronic form in 2005 and again in 2016. (Archived by WebCite¬Æ at https://www.webcitation.org/6izJ0FhUC). It examines US crime statistics by race and offers interpretations and policy suggestions. According to Taylor, statistics show that African Americans and Hispanics are overrepresented among criminal offenders, while Asian Americans are underrepresented. Taylor concludes that blacks commit more white-collar crimes and hate crimes than do whites. He further argues that there is more black-on-white interracial crime than there is white-on-black crime. Taylor claims that police are not biased against blacks or other ethnic groups. He states that research into race differences in criminal behavior is a worthwhile pursuit and suggests that the US immigration policy should consider these differences. Criticism In The New White Nationalism in America: Its Challenge to Integration (Cambridge University Press, 2002), Carol Miller Swain observed that the New Century Foundation faxed conclusions from the publication to major US newspapers, and that its stated purpose was to support the practice of racial profiling. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) called it \\"a kind of Bible\\" among its supporters, and has argued that the reason for the disparity in crime rates shown in the book is not Black genetics, but rather, the fact that Blacks have a lower socioeconomic status. The SPLC accuses Taylor of selection bias in his statistics. The SPLC also argues that Whites are targeted for robberies simply because of their higher wealth. Taylor counters by arguing that robberies only account for about one quarter of the total crimes committed by Blacks. Social activist and writer Tim Wise wrote an essay titled \\"The Color of Deception\\" as a rebuttal to The Color of Crime. His essay used data from the FBI and BJS showing that interracial crimes are actually fairly rare; that the vast majority of black (and white) crime is committed against victims of the same race; that whites still account for the majority of crime in the United States; and that part of the reason blacks are over-represented for many crime categories is their neighborhoods are generally much more heavily policed and black suspects are significantly less likely to be acquitted or released with a warning. The article also uses statistical data to argue that blacks are actually over-represented as victims of interracial violence per capita (arguing blacks are 50% more likely to be victims of interracial violence than pure chance would predict), and that overall, white criminals pose the greatest threat to white Americans and black criminals pose the greatest threat to black Americans. In her book, Hate Crimes, Barbara Perry refers to The Color of Crime as a classic of the genre produced by white nationalist academic racists.

She is based in New York City. Carucci has published three monographs to date; Closer (2002), Diary of a Dancer (2005), Mother (2013) and Midlife (2019) While maintaining a photography practice, Carucci has also taught at Princeton University and currently teaches at the School of Visual Arts in New York. In 2001, she was awarded the ICP Infinity Award and in 2010 a Guggenheim Fellowship. Carucci‚Äôs work has been included in solo shows at Edwynn Houk Gallery, and James Hyman in London. Life Carucci graduated in 1989 from Rubin Academy High School of Dance and Music in Jerusalem where she majored in Music. She then served in the Israeli Army for two years from 1989 to 1991. After serving she graduated in 1995 from Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design with a degree in photography and moved to New York City that same year, where she now lives with her husband, Eran Bendheim, and their two children. She currently teaches at the graduate program of photography at School of Visual Arts while continuing her personal fine art photography projects. Currently, she is returning to photographing her children and their social cycles as teenagers and working on a project about mid-life. Her work appeared in The New York Times Magazine, The New Yorker, New York Magazine, W, Aperture, ARTnews and many more publications. As put in a B&H; Studio Visit with Carucci,https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/features/studio- visit-elinor-carucci her work consistently dives into the personal, yet always with the goal of finding universal meaning. Her photographs reflect qualities of the snapshot home-photo-album aesthetic, yet also that of the theatrically staged image. In this, she melts boundaries between the two extremes of Nan Goldin and Sally Mann, two of her greatest inspirations, as described in ARTnews article published in November of 2006 by Edwynn Houk and in the B&H; Studio Visit with Carucci. The staged quality of many of her photographs often evokes questions from viewers of their authenticity. Yet, as described in Issue 12 of the magazine Dear Dave,http://ww.deardavemagazine.com/issue12.php > \\"Her photographs might be described as ‚Äòheightened reality,‚Äô lit, as they > often are like scenes from a play. This gives them a self-referential > quality‚Äìsimultaneously landed and choreographed. She has observed that, for > her, what is truthful does not necessarily correlate to whether it was > staged or not. In her photographs Carucci seeks what she calls 'emotional > truth,‚Äô where authenticity and theatricality can coexist.\\" Or even as described in the New Yorker: > ‚ÄúHer pictures are deep and elemental ‚Äì they have nearly confessional > quality, as if she, like Roupenian, is giving bold voice to things that > typically remain unsaid. ‚Äú Carucci‚Äôs work is a pathway for her bold voice to start a conversation about events in her life. Whether it is showing the challenging moments of being a parent or showing vulnerable moments in her personal relationship with her parents, her husband, children, or herself; Carucci has never shied away from exposing her emotions. As mentioned in the Issue 12 of the magazine Dear Dave: > ‚Äú...Elinor Carucci has never veered from the actual facts and details of her > life. In photographs that are posed yet revealing, Carucci has staged the > territory of domestic intimacy for almost 30 years.

She fearlessly documented her post- > partum body, the mess of snotty- nosed kids, and when her marriage was in > crisis, she unflinchingly made images of anger, tension and regret. ‚Äú  Carucci's major bodies of work  Closer Carucci‚Äôs first monograph, Closer, contains her earlier work focusing on immediate family and her closest relationships. A Time Lightbox article from 2013 summarizes the meaning behind this body of work: > ‚ÄúCloser (2002) chronicled her tumultuous relationship with her husband and > parents through incidences of infidelity (hers) too much dope (her > husband‚Äôs) and her parents fractious relationship and eventual divorce. The > mood was gentle, though, with plenty of high notes; the everyday ebb and > flow of relationships were lovingly and lavishly documented, while the > larger narratives played out in the background.\\" As Carucci describes in the introduction to Closer, > ‚ÄúThe camera was, in this sense, both a way to get close, and to break free. > It was a testimony to independence as well as a new way to relate. A > boundary, a distance, as well as the documentation of closeness. I could see > my mother, my husband, my father, at once in a detached and a related > way‚Ä¶..Things I had previously considered marginal drifted to the center and > often became themes in their own right. Ironically, the closer I got to the > details, the more I zoomed in the more universal the themes turned out to > be. Moving in turned out to be moving out. Work on minute details ‚Äì a mark > on the skin, a stitch, a hair, an eye, a kiss ‚Äì carried the work beyond the > boundaries of my family.‚Äù Also discussed in The Daily Telegraph article: > ‚ÄúWhile the pictures describe the vulnerability of our aging, corporeal > selves, they also describe they sensual and sexual pleasures to be had in > life seemingly right next to us, just for the asking ‚Äìkissing, stroking, > touching, embracing, hugging, eating, bathing, enjoying sex. We do, after > all, see three generations of the same family in the pages of the book. The > themes are many, ranging from female identity to family to mortality, and it > is the beauty of the work that we are drawn back to it to discover more and > more of them. ‚Äú Diary of a Dancer Published in her second monograph, Diary of a Dancer (2005), documents Carucci‚Äôs experience as a professional Middle-Eastern belly dancer entertaining at events like weddings and bar/bat mitzvahs in the five boroughs of New York. It proved difficult for her to dance and take photographs herself, so she often had the help of husband Eran Bendheim. Images in this work reflect Carucci applying makeup and preparing for jobs in dismal looking bathrooms and on subway rides, snapshots of her dancing and of the people she was entertaining. Mother Carucci‚Äôs latest published body of work, her third monograph Mother (2013) examines the world of her own motherhood. Beginning during the pregnancy of her twins and ending when they turn eight years old, she explores the deeply sensual and erotic connections between mother and child, all of the highs and lows in photographs reflecting the range of bliss to the raw, less attractive moments. She actively fights the clich√®, perfect Madonna and Child aesthetic, wanting to portray the full truth of the realities of motherhood. As someone who emigrated from Israel during her adult life, however, the book goes beyond a look at the familial. A Time Lightbox article discusses this: > ‚ÄúThe book is also an exploration of national identity and how having > children in a different country from your own makes one look at that country > more acutely. It makes an immigrant engage in one‚Äôs adopted home in a way > that was easy to avoid before‚Ä¶. [Mother] open[ed] her up to document life in > the city, meaning that in some elemental ways, the book is as much about New > York as it is about her family.‚Äù Also written in Los Angeles Times‚Äôs best photo books of 2013 article: > ‚Äú Her latest book, ‚ÄúMother‚Äù, is a dreamy but unromaniticized record of her > pregnancy and early motherhood, continuing a lineage of evocative > photography of childhood that includes Sally Mann‚Äôs groundbreaking 1992 book > ‚ÄúImmediate Family.‚Äù And > ‚ÄùThe earliest pictures in ‚ÄúMother‚Äù almost seem to have been shot in a womb, > the nakedness of her children as natural as puppies rolling in the grass.‚Äù Crisis This body of work (2001‚Äì2003) narrates a tumultuous time in her marriage to Eran Bendheim. Taking place at a time when they were working through her infidelity and chronic physical pain and his drug abuse, these photographs look straight into the darkness of post-arguments, as well as at their tender moments. Carucci has described how photographing this process actually brought them closer together, as they ultimately demonstrated to each other in the taking of these photographs that their love for one another is held above all else. Photographing was a way of reconnecting. Pain This project documents Carucci‚Äôs time dealing with excruciating back pain during the years 2002 to 2003. A Dear Dave magazine article from Issue 12 analyzes the image Pain V, suggesting that it alludes to a painting by Frida Kahlo, Broken Column. The writer draws the parallel between Kahlo and Carucci that their artworks represent their embodied, lived experiences, and that profound statements can be made in art produced from and representing the everyday, at- home experience: > ‚ÄúA second photograph Pain V, from 2003, shows Carucci in a back brace > encircling her lower abdomen; she bites her lower lip, riven by torment. > Carucci‚Äôs photographs recall Frida Kahlo‚Äôs Broken Column painting from > 1944‚Ä¶.Broken Column is a portrait of suffering‚ÄìKahlo‚Äôs torso is a crevasse > revealing the crumbling structure representing her spine.

It was in development for 7 years, during which it was highly anticipated. It contains two main storylines, each taking 15 hours or longer to play through, depending on whether the player focuses on exploration and completing secondary objectives rather than completing the main story. TNM is not commercially available, and therefore isn't rated by any official system. Compared to Deus Ex, it contains the same amount of graphic violence and substance abuse. However, it contains harsher language, as this reflects the general state of mind of its setting.  Gameplay  The gameplay is mostly identical to that of Deus Ex, save for a few additions, such as an in-game IRC client which adds a multiplayer element to an otherwise single-player game. In addition, the mod adds a highly configurable difficulty system, the ability to skip all cut scenes and a new training mission to acclimatize players to the changes. It also features some scripted linear sequences and levels, which are mainly used to modify the atmosphere (e.g. navigating through a maze full of deadly robots or going through a hall with laser traps), although most of the maps in the game retain the multiple-solution standard set by Deus Ex.  Weapons  With regard to weapons, the biggest change in TNM is that the player character can now fight with his fists, and can use different gloves to augment his fists by adding different effects to his punches. Moreover, the fists can be improved by investing skill points in their respective category, which now replaces the swimming skill (which was considered by many to be fairly useless). Other than that, the weapon arsenal was also upgraded, featuring several katanas, three new grenades, a napalm launcher and a rifle which fires PHAT rays (PHysically Anamorphic Transmogryphing rays which cause living targets to swell up until they explode) and rice bags as secondary ammunition. In addition to several other completely new weapons, the mod includes unique versions of some of the original weapons, pre-customised to suit the needs of particular characters. Some weapons now include multiple firing modes rather than secondary ammo type, which allows them to change the weapons function instantaneously. The weapon modding feature was carried over from Deus Ex ‚Äì players can modify existing guns, rifles and shotguns, but, unique to TNM, the changes will be reflected in the weapon model as well as in the weapon's functionality.  Meta Data  In any playthrough of the game, information about the world is gained, mainly in the form of passwords. The player can use those passwords on subsequent playthroughs, and therefore access certain areas that wouldn't be available in normal circumstances. This is anticipated, and many of the supposed sequence breakers are countered by interaction with the game's supervising AI, Narcissus. This adds more depth to game, as Narcissus has a major role in one of the game's endings.  Synopsis   Setting  TNM takes place in the first 3 days of September 2004, in PlanetDeusEx Forum City, a city state on ForumPlanet. PlanetDeusEx is only one Forum City out of many, although it is the only one playable. Each Forum City draws inspiration from a different game, with its general architecture and rules being that of the game. Such as, PlanetDeusEx features augmentations, while other Forum Cities feature their games' respective kind of enhancement. PlanetWarcraft, for example, features resources, and PlanetQuake features power-ups. Even though they are all unique to each Forum City, they all represent the user's rank. Because the city is devoted to Deus Ex, many of its dwellers, which represent the users' avatars, will try to emulate or reference it, e.g. building secret basements, coming up with conspiracy theories, and of course doing some conspiring of their own. This setting also means that Internet nomenclature is widely used, such that an infolink call is referred to as a Private Message, police officers are replaced by \\"firewalls\\", the ruler of Forum City is called the \\"admin\\", and so on.  Plot  Trestkon, a retired intelligence agent, is called back to duty by the government because of a missing moderator, Deus Diablo. They believe Trestkon is the only person who can be trusted, as Trestkon has been removed from the politics of the city for a few years. As soon as he arrives to Forum City, Trestkon is faced with the decision of which faction to side with: the moderators of PlanetDeusEx (PDX) who summoned him or the megalomaniac Scara B. King, CEO of WorldCorp (WC). Depending on the player's choice, the story changes radically. If the player joins PDX, Trestkon will continue his search for the missing moderator with his friends. Should the player choose WC, Trestkon will instead help Scara exploit the weakened government to gain world dominance while fighting against PDX. The choice is made through interaction with Silver Dragon, a local cultist who vandalized WC property and is trapped in the basement of the WorldCorp building. Choosing to rescue him will help PDX, while choosing to kill him will help WC. If the player chooses to work with PDX, Trestkon is sent to spy on their primary suspect for the abduction, WorldCorp. This puts them on to the existence of an old device that may be able to lead them to Deus Diablo, buried in the ruins of the city that Forum City was literally built on top of, Deus Ex Incarnate. After dealing with an incident of sabotage by WorldCorp, Trestkon delves into the ruins and retrieves the device, known as the \\"Firestaff\\". Trestkon then returns to Forum City where he must promptly deal with an ambush by WorldCorp mercenaries who have attacked the city in a desperate stalling move. Back at PDX headquarters, the Firestaff reveals that Deus Diablo is located on a previously unknown space station orbiting Forumplanet. Trestkon is sent to rescue the only independent helicopter pilot in the city from the clutches of a terrorist organisation (whom he may either annihilate or forge a truce with) so he can get to Aunt Betty Industries, a clothing factory outside the City which is a front for a space research facility. There, Trestkon secures a shuttle that takes him to the space station. If the player chooses to work for WorldCorp, he is immediately told about the Firestaff, its purpose, and its location. Unfortunately DXI is closed to the public, including WorldCorp agents, so in order to gain access, Trestkon must acquire the highly guarded admin password for the city. Following a failed blackmail attempt and a dangerous loyalty test, Trestkon finally manages to steal the password from PDX's high-security server complex and goes into DXI to retrieve the Firestaff. In this storyline too, Trestkon emerges into an ambush, but this time set up by PDX. When the Firestaff reveals Deus Diablo's orbital location, he is sent to steal a helicopter and interrogate its pilot to obtain the codes to its navigation system. As a final obstacle before he can go to Aunt Betty Industries for their space shuttle, Trestkon is forced to infiltrate an air-control tower to lift an electronic lockdown detaining the helicopter. In either storyline, when Trestkon reaches the space station, he is faced with the final decision of what faction to support. The options available to the player are based on previous decisions, such that not all options are accessible at any time: * PDX ending: Trestkon takes over the station and bans Scara. This puts PDX in total control of Forum City and indeed all of ForumPlanet, and enables the moderators of each city to establish real democracy. * WorldCorp ending: Trestkon destroys PDX using a laser powerful enough even to kill the otherwise immortal moderators. He then takes over the station and either makes Scara the omnipotent ruler of ForumPlanet, getting control of Forum City in return, or bans Scara and rules the world himself. * Ryan ending: Trestkon sides with the eccentric owner of Aunt Betty Industries and destroys the space station, negating all the power of the government. This also kills all communications and electricity, rendering WC useless. Forum City is ruled by anarchy. * Narcissus ending: a hidden ending in which Trestkon discovers that he is actually in a game and, with the player's help, learns to accept his role as a computer game character.  Cultural references  TNM features a more advanced text- reading system than that of Deus Ex, allowing the player to read multiple pages of the same book and allowing the books themselves to contain more information. Many of the texts in the world are used to expand the setting, and, true to TNM's setting, a large part of it was published through the internet, such as Twist, a novelization of Deus Ex, and Got Ghand #17, an article from a column in PlanetDeusEx. However, there are also excerpts from literary works outside of the internet, such as Douglas Adams's The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and John Gray's Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus. Outside of the content present in the books, there is also a huge number of popular and internet culture reference, such as the tasteful use of leet speak, posters and disc cases of popular games and movies, a minigame based around quotes and a mission with dialogue made up almost entirely of popular movie quotes. There is also one reference in the form of a weapon, the DaiKatana, which harms the player's character as he uses it. This is a reference to Daikatana, a well-known overhyped and buggy game.  Development  TNM was started as a mod for Deus Ex on January 6, 2002 by Lawrence Laxdal. The original mod was similar to the finished product only by the basic premise, as it was planned as a one or two map mission. At the time, Jonas W√¶ver acted as the lead writer of the project, with the rest of the team made up of volunteer modders from the PlanetDeusEx forum. After a false start as an open-world game, TNM tried to follow Deus Ex's design style, but only in later stages was Deus Ex analyzed from a design point of view. According to the team, there was no pre-production phase ‚Äì game assets were being produced while the design documents were written. After a period of development, it was decided that the mod would expand beyond its original scope. This also led to an effort to broaden the target audience, because of the notoriety of the forum fan fiction genre, by taking in feedback from outside the team. Further into development, in order to control the project, Laxdal and W√¶ver started letting people go based on whether or not they were reliable. This has led to an interesting dynamic, in which developers who contributed more to the end project were also given more time for their pet projects, which are mostly additional features that contribute only to the gameplay and setting. The scope of the project made it very time consuming to develop. Because of that, many of the assets were used as many times as possible, and often, two missions in different storylines take place on the same level. As the developers were spread across the world and were working for free, traditional management was impossible. Therefore, the team communicated mainly through instant messaging clients such as MSN Messenger, a developer forum and through an online database, which kept everyone on the team synchronised. After the release, the developers continued to provide support for the mod in the form of patches and by personally dealing with issues in the forums. They also released several developer commentaries discussing the development process   and post-mortem of the mod.  Music  The soundtrack of TNM was composed by Graeme Arthur, Leonardo Badinella, Steve Foxon, Brian Giannotti, Jonathan Gladwill, Andrew Livingston, Martin Ahm Nielsen and Trent Robertson. As each artist comes from a different background, the soundtrack contains various mixed genres, including ambient music, jazz fusion, techno, light rock, metal and classical music. Similar to Deus Ex, each setting in the game has multiple tracks, with the actions of the player affecting which track will play at any given time. For example, joining WorldCorp will change the track played in the rival PlanetDeusEx building from Democracy, Pt. I to Democracy, Pt. II, a more suspenseful track containing similar motifs. The TNM Official Soundtrack was released as a free download on December 10, 2009 on 2 discs, one featuring the music from friendly settings and the other featuring the music from the hostile ones. It does not include all of the tracks of TNM, but rather 25 hand-picked remastered and remixed tracks. The song \\"Looking at You\\" by Music Playing Disorder, which features Leonardo Badinella, is played during the end credits. Track listing  Reception  The Nameless Mod received very positive reviews. The Australian PC PowerPlay gave it a 9/10 calling the gameplay perfect, while complaining about some bugs and lamenting the age of the graphics and audio somewhat. The German magazine GameStar gave it a 5/5. The Mod also made first place Mod DB's Editor's Choice for Single-Player Mod of the Year, and 8th place on the player's choice for all categories of mods. As of August 2010, it holds a 9.7/10 score in Mod DB's user rating. The setting of the mod, however, got a polarized reception. Some of the reviewers found it fun and delightfully lighthearted, while others disliked it for perceived in-jokes and the goofiness of the characters, which is in contrast to Deus Ex's more serious style. Others complained about the attitude inconsistencies, with some aspects of the game being completely ridiculous (e.g. the cults) and some being far more serious. TNM also attracted the attention of Eidos Montr√©al, which was developing a prequel to Deus Ex. While TNM was not officially commented on, it was well appreciated by its developers, as they gave Off Topic Productions two exclusive screenshots from their project, Deus Ex: Human Revolution, to include in the mod. Those screenshots were indeed included in a later patch, and can be found in one of the secret areas.

Kogi woman and child on one of the terraces at Ciudad Perdida, Colombia (2017) Kogi shaman at Ciudad Perdida, Colombia (2017) Kogi man on one of the terraces at Ciudad Perdida, Colombia (2017) Language The Kogi language belongs to the Chibchan family. History The Kogi are descendants of the Tairona culture, which flourished before the times of the Spanish conquest. The Tairona were an advanced civilization which built many stone structures and pathways in the jungles. They made many gold objects which they would hang from trees and around their necks. They lived not much differently from modern day Kogi. Before the Spanish conquistadors arrived, the Tairona were forced to move into the highlands when the Caribs invaded around 1000 CE. The decision to flee to the mountains proved beneficial and strategic by the time the Spanish entered modern-day Colombia in the 15th century. Later, missionaries came and also began to influence their way of life, building chapels and churches amidst their villages to train and convert the locals. In the years since, the Kogi have remained in their home in the mountains, which allows them to escape the worst effects of colonization and aids them in preserving their traditional way of life.Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress Spiritual beliefs Indigenous Kogi shaman (2014) The Kogi base their lifestyles on their belief in \\"Aluna\\" or \\"The Great Mother,\\" their creator figure, who they believe is the force behind nature. The Kogi understand the Earth to be a living being, and see humanity as its \\"children.\\" They say that our actions of exploitation, devastation, and plundering for resources is weakening \\"The Great Mother\\" and leading to our destruction. Like many other indigenous tribes, the Kogi people honor a holy mountain which they call \\"Gonawindua,\\" otherwise known as Pico Crist√≥bal Col√≥n. They believe that this mountain is \\"The Heart of the World\\" and they are the \\"Elder Brothers\\" who care for it.\\"centre of the world\\" (the Sierra Nevada of Santa Marta). They also say that the outside civilization is the \\"Younger Brothers\\" who were sent away from The Heart of the World long ago. From birth the Kogi attune members of their society called Mamos (which means sun in Kogi), for guidance, healing, and leadership. The Mamos are not to be confused with shamans or curers but to be regarded as tribal priests who hold highly respected roles in Kogi society. Mamos undergo strict training to assume this role. Selected male children are taken from birth and put in a dark cave for the first nine years of their lives to begin this training. In the cave, elder Mamos and the child's mother care for, feed, train, and teach the child to attune to \\"Aluna\\" before the boy enters the outside world. Through deep concentration, symbolic offerings, and divination, the Mamos believe they support the balance of harmony and creativity in the world. It is also in this realm that the essence of agriculture is nurtured: seeds are blessed in Aluna before being planted, to ensure they grow successfully; marriage is blessed to ensure fertility; and ceremonies are offered to the different spirits of the natural world before performing tasks such as harvest and building of new huts. The Kogi Mamos have remained isolated from the rest of the world since the Spanish Conquistadors came to plunder South America for gold. In order to preserve their traditional way of life, they rarely interact with the modern world or with outside civilization. Outsiders are not allowed inside their ancestral lands.Ereira, Alan. (2009). The Elder Brothers' Warning, pp. 1‚Äì2. Tairona Heritage Trust London. . The Kogi Mamos say that the balance of the earth's ecology has been suffering due to the modern-day devastation of resources by Younger Brother. The Kogi Mamos in turn believe that their work as Elder Brother is instrumental in helping to prolong and protect life on earth. In a desperate attempt to prevent further ecological catastrophe and destruction, the Kogi Mamos broke their silence and allowed a small BBC film crew into their isolated mountaintop civilization to hear their message and warning to Younger Brother. The subsequent messages and warnings were voiced in the documentary . After the documentary was filmed, the Kogi Mamos returned to their work in isolation and asked outsiders not to come to their land. The Kogi soon realized that their message and warning had not been heeded by Younger Brother, and instead, as they had predicted, many catastrophes occurred and the natural world continued to be devastated at an even more rapid pace. In turn they contacted the same filmmaker twenty years later to give one final message. This became Aluna, a documentary made by the Kogi Mamos themselves in which they give a second warning and say that they have chosen to share their secret sciences with Younger Brother so that Younger Brother can help change the world for the better.  Cosmology and socio-religious concepts  Traditional Kogi religion is closely related to the structure of the cosmic universe that exists in dualistic expressions. On a cosmic level, the sun separates the universe into two hemispheres: the east/west and consequently a right/left. The Kogi use this dualistic notion to elaborate on a number of earthly divides: man/woman, male/female, heat/cold, light/dark, and right/left. They believe each of these groupings are complementary opposites. Within each pair, one cannot survive without the other. In the case of good(right)/evil(left), the Kogi believe committing a sin once in a while serves as a justification for the existence of good. These natural opposites are a way to keep the society balanced or ‚Äúin agreement‚Äù (yuluka). The two hemispheres are then divided into four segments: North/South/East/West. Within these four points of reference, the Kogi have associated the orientation of their religious framework into South/East as good/light and North/West as evil/dark. This cosmic structure has influenced four entrances to each village, four principal clans, and has divided the Sierra Nevada into four sections. Following this concept, the Kogi have structured the ceremonial houses and sacred offering sites into four quadrants. In the ceremonial house, a line is drawn down the middle of a circle, which divides the men into a left side where men ‚Äúknow more‚Äù, and a complementary right side of men who ‚Äúknow less‚Äù. In a system of four quadrants, the four lines inevitably meet in the center, creating a fifth dimension to the cosmic universe. The central point holds great significance to the Kogi people. It represents the center of the universe, the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. During the ceremony, this is the point where the Mamo buries the four sacred offerings and ‚Äúspeaks with god‚Äù. In the center of the circle, he places a tiny stool upon the spot where he receives and answers questions of the cosmic universe. In Kogi cosmology, they have added three dimensions to the standard N/S/E/W: Zenith, Nadir and the Center. This fixed system of points resembles an egg, and is formulated into nine stages/layers of development. Mother Goddess, the creator of the universe and mankind, created the cosmic egg. The horizontal layers of the egg are divided into two sections of four worlds with mankind (the 5th layer) residing in the center. The cosmic egg also represents the uterus of Mother Goddess and the Sierra Nevada. Because of this, the Kogi have built the structure of the ceremonial house as a replica of the cosmos. Funerary customs The Mamos\\"The Sierra Nevada Indians\\". Survival. participate in various rituals to celebrate the individual's life cycle from birth to death. These ceremonies include offerings, dances, and other ritual affairs. Although every life cycle is celebrated, emphasis on burial customs has been of much importance to the Kogi people. In this tribe, death is not viewed as a tragic event but as a ‚Äúfulfillment of life‚Äù. The burial process usually lasts approximately two hours and is performed without prayers and chants. To an outside viewer, the ritual might seem simple or without depth for such a spiritual tribe. What the viewer does not realize is that the funerary customs have philosophic concepts and deeper underlying meanings beyond the dimension of the western world. Burial rites are an act of ‚Äúcosmification‚Äù. When a person dies, the Mamos return him/her back to the uterus of Mother Goddess. The list below dictates eight components of the burial ritual analyzed by anthropologist Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff. # Verbalization of the cemetery as the ‚Äúvillage of Death‚Äù and as the ‚Äúceremonial house of Death‚Äù; verbalization of the burial pit as a ‚Äúhouse‚Äù and as a ‚Äúuterus‚Äù. # Flexed position of the corpse, placed in a carrying net, with a rope tied to the hair. #* The net represents the placenta of the uterus, which is connected by an umbilical cord (rope) that is cut after nine days. This allows the person to be rebirthed into another world. # Corpse resting on the left side and with the head orientated toward the east. #* The east is the direction of the sun and light of the universe. # Marked emphasis on right and left: position of hands; position of the corpse; left turns and right turns. #* As the person is turned, it creates the movement of the cosmic axis. # Placing of offerings at the sides, the center and the top of the burial pit. #* This placement relates to the sacred points: North/South/East/West/Zenith/Nadir/Center # Verbalization of the offerings as ‚Äúfood for the dead‚Äù. #* The dead not only consist of ancestors, but also mythical beings of the masters of plants and animals. Eating this offering has a close relationship with sexual intercourse. The food symbolizes male semen and also the fertilization of the supernatural being and thus serves a way to multiply the offering.

For nine days and nights, the soul wanders on a journey that ends in the rebirth of that soul. Traditions The Kogi have many characteristics that define their culture. For example, all Kogi men receive a \\"poporo\\" when they come of age. The \\"poporo\\" is a small, hollow gourd that is filled with \\"lima,\\" a type of powder that is made by heating and crushing shells to produce lime. The men also continuously chew coca leaves, a tradition followed by many indigenous tribes to connect them to the natural world. As they chew the coca leaves, they suck on the lime powder in their poporos, which they extract with a stick, and rub the mixture on the gourd with the stick to form a hardened layer or crust. The size of this layer depends on the maturity and the age of the Kogi man. Differences between women and men in the Kogi culture are very important; they have specific roles that are fundamental to their traditions. This image shows their clothes and the typical objects that they use in their common daily life. Kogi men and women all carry traditional bags across their shoulders. Only women are allowed to weave the bags. Many of the things carried inside a bag are secret and known only to the owner. Bags carried by Mamos contain sacred traditional objects. When two Kogi men meet, they use the customary greeting, which is to exchange handfuls of coca. Lifestyle Kogi men and women alike have simple modes of dress. The women pick, card, and spin wool and cotton while men do the weaving of the cloth. Clothing for men consists of a tunic and simple pants tied with a string at the waist. Clothing for women consists of a single length of cloth wrapped around their bodies as a dress. The Kogi all wear only pure white clothing. They say that white represents the Great Mother and therefore the purity of nature. The Kogi live in a series of villages, called Kuibolos,Kogis Indians of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Complete article about Kogis indigenous. (Updated December 2018.) containing circular huts made of stone, mud, and palm leaves. Men live in a separate hut from the women and children. Each village contains a large hut called a \\"nuhue\\" or temple where only men are allowed. In the \\"nuhue\\" many things are discussed and decisions are made. Divination and concentration also occur in these temples. Women are not allowed because the Kogi believe that women are more connected to the Great Mother and have no need of entering the temple. There are also women priests in the villages. All consultations are done with Mamos, and many of the decisions are based on their wisdom and knowledge. Many Kogi marriages are arranged by Mamos to ensure the most fruitful communities. Marriages are not forced, and the buying or selling of women is not permitted, although women as young as 14 can be married and have children. The Kogi do not allow the mistreatment of women, and it is not uncommon to find marriages that were not arranged, but the Kogi also disapprove of breaking arranged marriages. Kogi huts (2004) Fields, houses, and livestock are passed from mother to daughter as well as from father to son, which is bilateral inheritance of these items. There is also the normal parallel descent of personal items, including ritual objects which are male property and descend patrilineally. But certain rights, names or associations descend matrilineally. See the topic, Inheritance patterns, and see the topic, Patterns of descent. Common crops of trade are sugar and coffee. Much of the sugar is turned into \\"panela,\\" a type of Colombian hardened brown sugar. The women do most of the planting of the vegetables, but farming is a responsibility of the whole family.

His British parents were both born in India and his numerous works focus on the British Raj. Biography Charles Allen was born in India, where six generations of his family served under the British Raj. His father was a political officer on the North East Frontier.From frontispiece \\"Tales From The South China Sea\\" Futura Publications 1983 When Allen was four years old his father, Geoffrey St G.T. Allen was appointed Assistant Political Officer on the Balipara Frontier Tract in Assam, India. For several years the family lived at Sadiay, on the banks of the Brahmaputra River. It was here that Allen met the various tribesmen, mostly Abor and Mishmi warriors, that came down from the hills. Later when Allen had returned to England he heard about the exploits of his great grandfather, Colonel St G. C. Gore, Surveyor-General of India from 1899 to 1904, who had spent a lot of time in the Himalayas. Allen also met Professor (and Colonel) Kenneth Mason, who had been one of the last players in The Great Game, (a term that referred to the geo-political manoeuvrings between Great Britain and Russia in the late 19th and early 20th-centuries) Allen also received inspiration for his writing from earlier authors such as Sven Hedin.Preface to \\"A Mountain in Tibet\\" p7 Futura Edition 1983 When India became independent, in August 1947, the Allen family returned to England. However, not long after this move, Allen's father was asked to return to India to continue his work for the government. Allen and his brother stayed on in England to complete their education. Allen left Canford school, Dorset, with no qualifications. His only formal education was 18 months at a college in Perugia, Italy.The Guardian online, Charles Allen obituary, 21 August 2020, https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/21/charles-allen-obituary Between 1966 and 1967 Allen moved to Nepal to work with Voluntary Service Overseas. In Nepal Allen developed a fascination with Buddhism and as time passed he began to see himself as ‚ÄúBuddhist‚Äù. In Kathmandu he met his future wife, Liz Gould, whom he married in 1972. Allen supported the rights of low-caste Dalits, opposing the injustices that he had seen when growing up in India. It was at this time that he became convinced that he had a future as a travel writer. Following his work with Voluntary Service Overseas, Allen embarked on a Himalayan Trek which won him the Sunday Telegraph Traveler of the year trophy in 1967.John Murray Press contributor websiteThe Guardian online, Charles Allen obituary, 21 August 2020, https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/21/charles-allen-obituary Success as a writer, came in 1974 via his involvement with the BBC Radio 4 oral history series and subsequent book \\"Plain Tales from the Raj\\". Since then, Allen has spent long periods of his adult life in India as a traveller and writer of history.Information from the biography of Allen Allen has also trekked and climbed extensively in the Himalayas, arctic Norway, the jungles of Sarawak and in 1979 was among the first foreigners for many years to reach \\"Cow Mouth\\" which is the traditional source of the Ganges River which lies at 3,962m (13,000 feet) above sea level, in the Gangotri glacier. The river emanates from a cavern called Gaumukh, meaning 'Cow's Mouth', because of its shape.From frontispiece \\"Tales From The South China Sea\\" Futura Publications 1983. And The British Library on line http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/other/019xzz000000108u00013000.html Allen's work focuses largely on India and the Indian Subcontinent in general. Some have criticised Allen for not acknowledging the subcontinent's natural and political history during the British rule. A point that was stated by Edward Said's in his book, \\"Orientalism\\". However, as Allen stated in 2015 ‚ÄúWe use that word history ‚Äî we bandy it about too seriously. History is a minefield. It has always been used as propaganda. We have to look at it with an open mind.‚Äù Allen died at his home in Somerset, England on 16 August 2020 aged 80.The Guardian online, Charles Allen obituary, 21 August 2020, https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/21/charles-allen-obituary He is survived by his children and his wife, Elizabeth.

Only one hiking trail ascends Huntington Ravine toward Mount Washington's summit; that trail, the Huntington Ravine Trail, crosses a boulder field, ascends a talus fan, and winds steeply up the center of the cirque's headwall, requiring several tricky scrambling moves that may be intimidating for less-experienced (or more acrophobic) hikers. All other portions of the headwall are too steep to climb safely without climbing gear and technical expertise. Several popular rock-climbing routes, such as the Pinnacle route and the Henderson Ridge, do ascend the ravine, and in the winter the Pinnacle Gully is especially popular as an ice- climbing challenge. Because the ravine is higher and more exposed to the elements than most other climbing areas in the eastern United States, rock and ice climbing ‚Äî and even hiking ‚Äî are risky and weather-dependent. Avalanches, icefalls, and hypothermia have killed climbers in Huntington repeatedly in recent years, and the hiking path is usually not passable until late May or early June.

Early life  Thurston was born on 31 January 1836 in London, England, where he received an elementary education before pursuing a nautical career in 1850. In 1855 he became the first officer, but shortly afterwards was struck down by cholera and was sent to Australia to recover. He became a sheep farmer with a friend, but in 1862 the farm was destroyed by a flood. In 1864, he joined a botany expedition to the South Sea Islands and was wrecked off the coast of Samoa, where he was stranded for eighteen months, before being rescued and brought to Fiji.  Political life in Fiji  Shortly after his arrival in Fiji, he was employed by the British Consulate. In 1869 he became acting Consul for Fiji and Tonga. In June 1871, Thurston, then Britain's honorary consul, forged a \\"marriage of convenience\\" between the Bauan chief Seru Epenisa Cakobau and the British settlers. He persuaded the Fijian chiefs to surrender the independence of their fiefdoms and accept a constitutional monarchy with Cakobau as King, but with real power in the hands of a cabinet and legislature dominated by settlers. The arrangement was not particularly successful. Within months, government overspending had led to the accumulation of an unmanageable debt which led to economic and social unrest. In 1872, Thurston approached the British government, at Cakobau's request, with an offer to cede the islands to the United Kingdom. (A previous offer almost two decades earlier had been turned down). The British were much more inclined to annexe Fiji now than they had been previously. The murder of Bishop John Patteson of the Melanesian Mission at Nukapu in the Reef Islands had provoked public outrage, which was compounded by the massacre by crew members of more than 150 Fijians on board the brig Carl. Two British commissioners were sent to Fiji to investigate the possibility of an annexation. The negotiations were concluded with Thurston himself acting as Premier, from 23 March to 10 October 1874, when Cakobau and his fellow-chiefs formally ceded the archipelago to the United Kingdom. Thurston later served as Colonial Secretary. In this capacity, he persuaded the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to extend its operations into Fiji by providing it with of land to establish its plantations. 1879 Thurston became the secretary to the High Commissioner. In February 1888, Thurston became Governor of Fiji, a position he held until he died on 7 February 1897.  Botanical contributions  Thurston was also responsible for the establishment of Suva Botanical Gardens, later named Thurston Gardens in his honour. Thurston's Palm (Pritchardia thurstonii) is named after him.  Personal life  He married, first, about 1866, a French lady, Madame Marie de Lavalatte (died 14 December 1881); secondly, on 14 January 1883, Amelia, daughter of John Berry of Albury, New South Wales, who, with three sons and two daughters, survived him. The British government granted Lady Thurston a civil list pension in consideration of her husband's services, and the government of Fiji a pension of 50l. to each of the five children during minority. In 1895 Thurston's health gave way, and he returned to England on leave. Returning to his post in 1896, he died at sea on S.S. Burrumbeet 7 February 1897, between Sydney and Melbourne. Sir John Bates Thurston is buried in Melbourne General Cemetery and his grave site has its upkeep paid by the Fijian Government. He was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1880, and Knight Commander of that same order in 1887; he was a fellow of the Linnean and Geographical societies.

Weather sensors The road has a series of sensors located at various altitudes along it. The sensors transmit weather data via a solar-powered radio link. Events The oldest auto race in the United States, the Mount Washington Hillclimb Auto Race, was hosted on the auto road in 1904.GLH Racing www.glhracing.com Every year in June, the mountain road is host to the Mount Washington Road Race, an event which attracts hundreds of runners. In July, the mountain road hosts Newton's Revenge, and in August the Mount Washington Auto Road Bicycle Hillclimb, both of which are bicycle races that run the same route as the road race. The hillclimb's most notable victor to date has been former Tour de France contender Tyler Hamilton. The climb is regarded as one of the world's toughest for cyclists - it features a greater altitude gain, and is steeper, than the Mortirolo Pass, the Monte Zoncolan, and the Alto de El Angliru, and is far steeper than any of the famous climbs featured in the Tour de France. Another event, although not a race, is the annual MINIs On Top event. Now in its 12th year, the drive to the summit began with 73 BMW MINI Cooper and Cooper S vehicles and now exceeds 200 cars. The only reason more MINIs don't drive to the summit is the fact there's not enough space to hold all the cars, despite their diminutive size. MINIs On Top (or MOT) is held the Saturday of Father's Day weekend every June.

It is named after the French explorer Jean-Jacques Dussumier. It is native to the Seychelles, where it is known as kolibri in Seychellois Creole. This bird is placed in the genus Cinnyris by some authorities and in Nectarinia by others. Although this bird has a limited range, it is described as common and has a stable population, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".  Description  It can reach a length from eleven to twelve centimetres. The plumage is dull grey. The male exhibits an iridescent violet- green sheen on its head and throat, brown underparts and yellow or orange tufts under its wings, which are more noticeable in flight. The long slender bill is downcurved. The legs are black. The female is an altogether duller- looking bird with pale grey underparts, and lacks the yellow pectoral tufts. The song of the males is high pitched, noisy and harsh, interspersed with various rasping calls. The female also sings.  Distribution  The Seychelles sunbird occurs on most of the larger granitic islands of the Seychelles Bank. It belongs to the endemic landbird species of the Seychelles which had adapted to human made environment changes in the best way. Its habitat consists of forests, gardens, scrubs, and mangroves from sea level to altitudes of .  Diet  When foraging for food, this sunbird is very active, flying to hibiscus and other flowers with undulating flight and feeding of nectar and insects.  Reproduction  Breeding is the entire year but the best time is September and October. One single egg is laid in a pear-shaped nest. It consists of grass and moss and is bound with spiderwebs. To protect the nest from cats and rats it hangs usually at the end of a twig.  References  * Robert A.

Biography A 17-year-old resident of Burlington, New Jersey when he enlisted in the 6th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry on August 7, 1861, he was mustered in for three years of service as a Private in Company F on August 26, 1861. During his first year of enlistment his regiment fought in the 1862 Peninsular Campaign (most notably in the May 1862 Battle of Williamsburg and the Battle of Fair Oaks), and in the August 29, 1862 Battle of Second Bull Run. It was during that engagement that he performed his act of bravery that he was eventually awarded the Medal of Honor for. He was promoted to Corporal on September 10, 1862, and to Sergeant on February 4, 1863. He served with the regiment through its participation in the 1863 Battle of Chancellorsville (where he was wounded), the Battle of Gettysburg and the Mine Run Campaign. With less than a year left of his initial term of service, he re-enlisted early on February 18, 1864. When the original enlistments of the 6th New Jersey expired by law in September 1864, new recruits and re-enlistees of the regiment were folded into the 8th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry. Sergeant Conner was transferred to the 8th New Jersey's Company E, with whom he served until the end of the Civil War in May 1865. He was mustered out of service on July 17, 1865. After the war he moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was a resident of that city when he was awarded the Medal of Honor on September 17, 1897, which recognized his act of bravery 35 years later. He died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was buried there in North Cedar Hill Cemetery in Section W3, Lot 28. His grave is marked by an upright government-issue Medal of Honor marker, which was erected in 2000, seventy-six years after his death. Medal of Honor citation Rank and organization.

The term covers a wide array of world languages (other than English), ranging from some of the world's largest and most influential languages, such as Chinese, Russian, Arabic, Bengali, Hindi, Portuguese, Japanese, Persian, Urdu, and Turkish, to smaller regional languages studied in the US mainly by area experts, such as Twi, spoken in West Africa, and Finnish. The term arose out of a need to contrast the more commonly taught languages in US K-12 public education with those normally encountered only at university level, a great divide reflected both in the US textbook industry, which caters to the existing K-12 market by necessarily focusing on the \\"Big Three,\\" (Spanish, French and German) and in historical US government funding for foreign language education. (In fact, one Stanford University language educator has referred to LCTLs as the \\"Less Commonly Funded Languages\\".) To facilitate the development of instructional formats specifically for the low- enrollment languages at U.S. colleges/universities, the National Association of Self-Instructional Language Programs (NASILP) was established in the 1970s. After 9/11, US federal departments and agencies recognized the strategic importance of LCTLs such as Arabic and, as a result, have begun funding programs for LCTLs such as the National Flagship Language Initiative (NFLI) under the auspices of the National Security Education Program (NSEP). These programs have been developed to encourage growth in the teaching of less commonly taught languages critical to national security such as Arabic, Persian, Hindi, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, and Russian. Within the US academic/educational community, previously informal links among LCTL educators crystallized into the National Council of Less Commonly Taught Languages (or NCOLCTL), \\"an umbrella organization for national associations and individuals interested in less commonly taught languages\\" founded in 1990 and based at the Indiana University Bloomington. > The Council's mission is to increase the number of Americans who choose to > learn one or more of the less commonly taught languages (LCTLs) as a means > of enhancing cross-cultural communication among citizens of the United > States . ...

Another active organization linking students and teachers of LCTLs is the LCTL project at CARLA, the Center for Advanced Research on Language Acquisition, at the University of Minnesota. The LCTL project maintains a large database of where LCTLs are taught in North American colleges/universities, k-12 schools, distance education, study abroad, and summer courses.LCTL project database With over 350 languages listed on the database, and approximately 3,000 schools, the database is updated daily. In addition to the database, the LCTL project sponsors mailing lists for teachers of various LCTLs, royalty free graphics and sounds for language teachers, and a summer institute on developing material for LCTL teachers.LCTL project mailing lists.

They were briefly united in 1917 with Leipziger BC 1883 to form the wartime side SG LBC Olympia 1896 but re-emerged at the end of World War I in 1918 as BV Olympia. In 1926 they played as BSV Olympia-Germania until renamed VfL Olympia 96 in 1938. After World War II Allied authorities ordered the dissolution of existing organizations in Germany, including sports and football clubs. In the fall of 1945 the creation of new clubs was allowed and the team was re-formed as ZSG Industrie-Mitte. Playing in the Soviet-occupied part of the country that eventually became East Germany, the club underwent frequent name changes and mergers as was common there. In quick succession the team was known as Fahrzeugbau Leipzig-Mitte (1947), BSG Gohlis-S√ºd (1948), and then BSG Lok Nord (1951). In 1961 they merged with BSG Motor Gohlis (not the similarly named Motor Gohlis-Nord) to become BSG Motor Nord. After German reunification in 1990 the team was registered as SV Motor Leipzig-Nord e.V. before finally merging with VfL 1977 Leipzig in 1999 to become SG Olympia Leipzig. The club has been playing in local amateur football in recent times, competing in the tier nine Stadtklasse Leipzig until 2015, when it was promoted to the Stadtliga for a season, suffering instand relegation again.SG Olympia Leipzig at Fussball.de Tables and results of all German football leagues Lipsia *FC Lipsia was founded in the \\"Zur M√ºhle\\" restaurant on 1 February 1893, making it the first club formed in Saxony.

The club is mainly known for their football team. It currently plays in the Primera C Metropolitana, the fourth level of the Argentine football league system.  History   The beginning  The club was founded in 1910 in the Belgrano neighborhood of Buenos Aires. The name \\"Excursionistas\\" (which could roughly be translated as \\"Voyagers\\" in Spanish) was chosen due to the founders' constant trips (voyages) to the Paran√° River and Isla Maciel to compete in athletic tournaments. They initially named the club \\"Club Uni√≥n Excursionistas\\". The first jersey worn was green (for the color of grass) with a horizontal white stripe (white referred to the tablecloths used in the picnics they frequently had).  Entering the football league  Excursionistas disputed its first tournament in 1911, playing its home games at \\"Club Florida\\", an institution of Florida neighborhood in Greater Buenos Aires. Before the 1912 season, the club acquired a land in Belgrano neighborhood, where its stadium was built, more precisely on the corner of streets La Pampa and Mi√±ones. In 1916, the team was promoted to the second division (then named Divisi√≥n Intermedia) after defeating Palermo by 1‚Äì0. In 1919 the club changed its name to the current \\"Club Atl√©tico Excursionistas\\", also modifying its jersey, which vertical stripes of white and green.  Promotion to the first division - 20s to 50s  Intermedia championship in 1924. In 1924, in the old San Lorenzo de Almagro stadium, Excursionistas defeated Talleres de Remedios de Escalada 2‚Äì1, thus proclaiming themselves champion and earning the promotion to Primera Divisi√≥n. More than 10,000 spectators attended the match. In 1931 goalkeeper Fortunato Grimoldi was called up to the Argentina national team. He also appeared on the cover of El Gr√°fico (the most important sports magazine in Latin America) in 1930. In 1934 the Argentine Football Association (which Excursionistas was affiliated to) merged with dissident Liga Argentina de Football in a unified league. This restructuring sent Excursionistas to the second division along with many other teams that decided to continue as amateurs. Since then, the club has remained in the lower divisions of Argentine football. In 1942 Excursionistas finished 2nd after Rosario Central. That team, coached by Pedro Tilhet, is regarded by fans as the best Excursionistas team of all-time. In 1957 Excursionistas had to play a playoff series against Argentino de Quilmes in order to define which team would be relegated to second division. After a 2‚Äì2 draw in the first game, Excursionistas achieved a great 6‚Äì1 win in the second match, so the team kept its place in Primera Divisi√≥n and sent off Argentino to Primera B.  1970 - 2010  In 1972 Excursionistas was relegated to Primera C, where they remained until 1995 when the team was promoted to Primera B, although they lasted there for just one season. During the 1998‚Äì99 season Excursionistas made a great campaign, putting together a 16 match unbeaten streak. The following season (1999‚Äì2000), the squad, coached by N√©stor Rapa, achieved a historic landmark of 10 consecutive wins, finishing in 1st place and thus earning promotion. Nevertheless, the institution was punished with a 21-point deduction due to the riot caused by a portion of its fans during the match against Club Comunicaciones, in which the fans invaded the pitch and attacked the Comunicaciones players.\\"La AFA atendi√≥ los reclamos y tom√≥ una decisi√≥n hist√≥rica\\", La Naci√≥n, 2000-05-05 As a result, Excursionistas missed the opportunity to earn promotion. In 2001, Excursionistas won the Clausura tournament, although the team was not promoted due to the restructuring of the tournament format. That title only earned Excursionistas the right to play a two-leg semi-final for the right to earn promotion. Their rival on the occasion was Deportivo Laferrere, who proceeded to eliminate Excursionistas. The results were 2-0 for Laferrere in the first leg and 3-2 for Excursionistas in the second, which meant Excursionistas were eliminated on global 4-3. Friendly match at Excursionistas stadium.  2010 onward  In the 2010-11 season, Excursio finished 8th in the division, thus qualifying for the second phase of the tournament. They then qualified for a subsequent round against Talleres de Remedios de Escalada after winning 3-1 at home and 0-1 away, before being eliminated by Argentino de Merlo due to a 1-2 home defeat and a 0-0 away draw. Excursionistas' defense remained the most invulnerable in the division that season, with only 27 goals scored against in 38 matches. In the 2016 \\"Campeonato Transici√≥n Primera C,\\" Excursionistas was crowned Champion after beating Sacachispas 1-0, thus earning the only spot for promotion to Primera B in the season. The team reached 41 points in the season on a record of 12 victories, 5 draws, 2 defeats, 36 goals for and 24 against. Their standout player for the season was Leonardo Ruiz, who finished the season as top scorer with 16 goals.

Route description  Route 100 lies wholly within the town of East Haven. It begins at US 1 in the eastern part of town and heads west through the town center along Main Street before turning north along North High Street. It crosses over US 1 without a direct connection and intersects I-95 at exit 52 before continuing north to end at Route 80 in the Foxon section of town. The interchange with I-95 is a partial one and allows direct access to northbound and from southbound I-95 only. Traffic heading for southbound I-95 is directed to use Kimberly Avenue, which connects to US 1. This portion of Kimberly Avenue is an unsigned state road with designation State Road 735.  History  Modern Route 100 was established in 1935, running approximately from the current location of the intersection of US 1 and the Amtrak railroad to Route 80. Since then, the southern terminus has been moved several times. In 1943, it was extended south along Thompson Avenue (formers SR 558) to the entrance of Tweed-New Haven Airport. In 1962, the southern end of Route 100 was relocated, taking over part of Route 142 to Silver Sands Road, ending at a reconfigured Route 142, which was changed to continue west along Silver Sands Road and modern Route 337. This configuration was reversed in 1969, as the section of Route 100 south of Main Street was reassigned back to Route 142. The south end was shifted further east in 1993 to end at US 1 near the Branford town line.Connecticut Routes, Route 100 Junction list References External links 100 Category:Transportation in New Haven County, Connecticut Category:East Haven, Connecticut ","title":"Connecticut Route 100"},{"id":"7085621","text":"use both this parameter and |birth_date to display the person's date of birth, date of death, and age at death) --> death_place = death_cause = body_discovered = resting_place = resting_place_coordinates = burial_place = burial_coordinates = monuments = nationality = other_names = Leung Siu-lung citizenship = education = alma_mater = occupation = Actor spouse = partner = children = parents = mother = father = relatives = family = callsign = awards = website = module = module2 = module3 = module4 = module5 = module6 = signature = signature_size = signature_alt = footnotes = }} Bruce Leung Siu-lung (born Leung Choi-sang; April 28, 1948) is an actor who has appeared in many Hong Kong martial arts movies. He often appeared billed as \\"Bruce Leung\\", \\"Bruce Liang\\", \\"Bruce Leong\\", or \\"Bruce Leung Siu-lung\\", and is thus generally grouped among the Bruce Lee clones that sprang up after Lee's death in the subgenre known as Bruceploitation. Background Leung learned martial arts from his father at the Cantonese opera. While his major style is Goju ryu Karate, he also is a Wing Chun practitioner. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, he appeared in a large number of martial arts films. Most familiar to Western audiences may be Jim Kelly's The Tattoo Connection (in which he only appeared briefly, but choreographed the action sequences) and Jackie Chan's Magnificent Bodyguards, which was the first Hong Kong film shot in 3D. He is also known for playing Bruce Lee in the notorious Bruceploitation classic, The Dragon Lives Again. In addition, Leung appeared in his own star vehicles, including My Kung-Fu 12 Kicks, Kung Fu: The Invisible Fist, and Black Belt Karate. Leung retired from acting after 1988's Ghost Hospital. However, in 2004, he made a return to the screen as The Beast in Stephen Chow's Kung Fu Hustle (which, incidentally, was his first villainous role). In 2007, he appeared as himself in Italian documentary Dragonland directed by Lorenzo De Luca. The interview was made by night on the set of Shamo.

A free-floating barrel is a firearm design used in precision rifles, particularly match grade benchrest rifles, to accurize the weapon system. With conventional rifles, the gun barrel rests in contact with the fore-end of the gunstock, sometimes along the whole length. If the stock is manufactured from wood, environmental conditions or operational use may warp the wood, which may also cause the barrel to shift its alignment slightly over time, altering the projectile's external ballistics and thus the point of impact. Contact between the barrel and the stock also interferes with the natural frequency of the barrel, which can have a detrimental effect on accuracy especially when the barrel gets hot with repeated firing. The interference of the stock with the barrel's oscillation harmonics as the bullet passes down the bore can cause the barrel to vibrate inconsistently from shot to shot, depending on the external forces acting upon the stock at the time of the shot. Micro-vibrations acting during the bullet's passage result in differences in trajectory as the bullet exits the bore, which changes the point of impact downrange. A free-floating barrel is one where the barrel and stock are designed to not touch at any point along the barrel's length. The barrel is attached to its receiver, which is attached to the stock, but the barrel \\"floats freely\\" without contacting any other gun parts (except the front sight, which is often mounted on the barrel). This minimizes the variance in possible mechanical pressure distortions of the barrel alignment, and allows vibration to occur at the natural frequency consistently and uniform shot-by-shot. Alternatives include using a stock manufactured from composite materials which do not deform as much under temperature or humidity changes, or with a wood stock using a fiberglass contact area (so-called \\"glass bedding\\"). Stocks which contact the barrel are still popular for many utility weapons, though most precision rifle designs have largely adopted free-floating barrels.

It was first performed at the Savoy Theatre on 14 November 1901, running for a total of 110 performances until 29 March 1902. It toured thereafter. The Willow Pattern was a companion piece to Ib and Little Christina (for 16 performances) and later Iolanthe (94 performances). It and was toured in Britain and America. A copy of the printed libretto is in the British Library, at 11778.f.23(5). (1901). The vocal score was published by Chappells, and a copy is in British Library at F.690.j.(2) [1902]. A silent film of the legend was made in 1914, called Story of the Willow Pattern. When the Gilbert and Sullivan partnership disbanded after the production of The Gondoliers in 1889, impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte and, after his death, his widow Helen Carte, filled the Savoy Theatre with a combination of new works and revivals of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. The fashion in the late Victorian era and Edwardian era was to present long evenings in the theatre, and so Carte preceded his Savoy operas with curtain raisers, such as The Willow Pattern was, when played with Iolanthe.Lee Bernard. \\"Swash-buckling Savoy curtain-raiser\\", Sheffield Telegraph, 1 August 2008 W. J. MacQueen-Pope commented, concerning such curtain raisers: :This was a one-act play, seen only by the early comers. It would play to empty boxes, half-empty upper circle, to a gradually filling stalls and dress circle, but to an attentive, grateful and appreciative pit and gallery. Often these plays were little gems. They deserved much better treatment than they got, but those who saw them delighted in them. ... [They] served to give young actors and actresses a chance to win their spurs ... the stalls and the boxes lost much by missing the curtain-raiser, but to them dinner was more important.MacQueen- Pope, Walter James. Carriages at Eleven (1947), London: Robert Hale and Co., p. 23 Synopsis A plate with the Blue Willow pattern The libretto follows the familiar legend of the willow pattern, but with the addition of some extra characters, notably a rogue, PingPong, who helps to trick the father into allowing his daughter to marry her lover. The Legend of the Willow Pattern was invented by the English over 200 years ago to promote pottery sales of a china willow pattern based on an older china pattern. The story runs as follows (with the frequent references to the figures in the plate design omitted): Once there was a wealthy mandarin, who had a beautiful daughter. She had fallen in love with a humble accountant, angering her father. He dismissed the young man and built a high fence around his house to keep the lovers apart. The Mandarin was planning for his daughter to marry a powerful Duke. The Duke arrived by boat to claim his bride, bearing a box of jewels as a gift. The wedding was to take place on the day the blossom fell from the willow tree. 1901 drawing of a scene 1901 drawing of a scene On the eve of the daughter's wedding to the Duke, the young accountant, disguised as a servant, slipped into the palace unnoticed. As the lovers escaped with the jewels, the alarm was raised. They ran over a bridge, chased by the Mandarin, whip in hand. They eventually escaped to the safety of a secluded island, where they lived happily for years. But one day, the Duke learned of their refuge. Hungry for revenge, he sent soldiers, who captured the lovers and put them to death. The Gods, moved by their plight, transformed the lovers into a pair of doves. Roles and cast *Ah Mee, a maiden.

Hare. Contents summary The text covers the nature of psychopaths in the context of employment and purports to explain how psychopaths manipulate their way into work and get promoted, the effects of their presence on colleagues and corporations, and the superficial similarities (and fundamental differences) between leadership skills and psychopathic traits. The work is interlaced with fictional narratives illustrating how the factual content applies to real-life situations. Characteristics of manipulators are described as shifting to meet stereotypical gender expectations: a female psychopath might make full use of the passive, warm, nurturing, and dependent gender role stereotype in order to get what she wants out of others and a male psychopath might use a macho image, intimidation, and aggression to achieve satisfaction of his desires. The authors posit that around 1% of senior positions in business are occupied by psychopaths. The authors describe a \\"five phase model\\" of how a typical workplace psychopath climbs to and maintains power: entry, assessment, manipulation, confrontation, and ascension. In the entry stage, the psychopath will use highly developed social skills and charm to obtain employment in an organisation. At this stage it will be difficult to spot anything which is indicative of psychopathic behaviour, and as a new employee you might perceive the psychopath to be helpful and even benevolent. Once on to the assessment stage, the psychopath will weigh you up according to your usefulness, and you could be recognised as either a pawn (who has some informal influence and will be easily manipulated) or a patron (who has formal power and will be used by the psychopath to protect against attacks). Manipulation involves the psychopath creating a scenario of ‚Äúpsychopathic fiction‚Äù where positive information about themselves and negative disinformation about others will be created, where your role as a part of a network of pawns or patrons will be utilised and you will be groomed into accepting the psychopath's agenda. Once on to the confrontation stage, the psychopath will use techniques of character assassination to maintain their agenda, and you will be either discarded as a pawn or used as a patron. Finally, in the ascension stage, the role of the subject as a patron in the psychopath‚Äôs quest for power will be discarded, and the psychopath will take for himself/herself a position of power and prestige from anyone who once supported them. Reception A review of Snakes in Suits by The Australian called it \\"a lay guide to corporate psychopaths.\\" and concluded \\"However wooden in parts, Snakes in Suits is a valuable addition to any business library.\\" Snakes in Suits has also been reviewed by Publishers Weekly, Booklist, Psychology Today, California Bookwatch, Security Management, Canadian Business, and Finweek.

Early career Callan reached prominence as editor of the Londoner's Diary in the Evening Standard in the 1960s, and then with a Daily Mail diary column. He achieved a succession of scoops, and was responsible for training up a generation of young journalists, notably the gossip columnist, Nigel Dempster. Callan later moved to the mass circulation the Daily Mirror where he wrote the \\"Inside World of Paul Callan\\" column which broke a number of major stories embarrassing to their subjects. Celebrity interviews Tiring of the gossip columns, Callan moved over to the celebrity interview. Callan's amiability and nose for a story made him a favourite of actors and publishers alike, and he has interviewed virtually every major Hollywood star in the last forty years, and members of the British royal family. He is credited with the shortest interview ever published. Meeting the reclusive Greta Garbo at the Hotel du Cap Eden Roc near Cannes, Callan got as far as, \\"I wonder . . \\" before Garbo cut in with, \\"Why wonder?\\", and stalked off. The story ran across a full page in the Daily Mail. He married New York journalist Steffi Fields in 1973, who moved over from being London correspondent of the fashion bible Women's Wear Daily to the position of news editor of the London bureau of the NBC television network. Radio Callan and the writer (later national newspaper editor) Janet Street-Porter are credited with inventing a new form of radio, albeit unintentionally. At the launch in 1973 of the London Broadcasting Company, or LBC, the pair were pitched as co-presenters of the breakfast show. The intention was to contrast the urbane Callan with the less couth Street- Porter, whose accents were respectively known to studio engineers as \\"cut- glass\\" and \\"cut-froat\\". In the event friction between the pair led to an entertaining stream of one-upmanship that became required listening for many Londoners. The programme was the first in the UK to combine interviews with celebrities and heavyweight political figures on the same show, blurring the line between classic British comedy and analysis of international affairs. Innovation In parallel with David Frost's approach to television Callan has since developed a technique known as \\"news colour\\" in which a hard news story is reported in a feature style. It has the effect of placing the reader as if he is actually witnessing the story, and is now taught in journalism school. As one of the last representatives of old Fleet Street he cuts an unmistakable figure, clad in pinstriped suit and trademark spotted bow tie regardless of geography or climate. In 1991 he moved to the Daily Express where he combines feature writing with news colour as well as contributing regularly to the comment pages. Callan is also a familiar face on television, remembered as a contributor to the What the Papers Say programme. Callan is also known for his acerbic book reviews despite being described by the critic Clive James as \\"having the literary sensibilities of a vampire bat\\".James, Clive. \\"The Queen in California\\".

After spending a year in Spain with the reserve team of Real Mallorca as a teenager, he spent all of his career in the lower divisions of Scottish football, playing for various clubs including Alloa Athletic (three spells), Greenock Morton, East Stirlingshire, Airdrie United, Cowdenbeath and Peterhead. Career Early years and Mallorca Stevenson began his career with Scottish Premier League club Aberdeen. He was released because they believed he was too small to make the grade in professional football. From there he dropped down the leagues and joined Alloa Athletic while training to become a mechanic. It was after just two first team appearances with the club that Stevenson's life was turned upside down. In what has been described as a 'Roy of the Rovers' moment he was spotted playing a game of football with his uncle on the Spanish island of Majorca.Alloa youth given Real chance, BBC Sport, 27 November 2002. A scout from Spanish La Liga side Real Mallorca approached Stevenson and offered him a trial. Stevenson made such an impression in this trial that he was offered a 3-year contract. Stevenson only lasted just over a year at the Son Moix stadium; in his time in Spain he did not make a first team appearance but was a regular in the B side, for whom he scored a goal on his debut. Real Mallorca were keen to hold on to Stevenson and part of his release stated that he could only return to his former club Alloa, which he did in February 2004. Return to Scotland In season 2005‚Äì06 he was a star man for Alloa Athletic almost single-handedly keeping them in the Second Division via the end of season 2nd Division/3rd Division playoffs. His form alerted several larger clubs but to many people's surprise he chose to sign a pre-contract agreement with Greenock Morton, a club who were in the same division as Alloa. Morton agreed to pay Alloa a nominal sum believed to be in the region of ¬£16,000. In July 2008, he moved to Alloa Athletic for a third spell after joining the second division club on loan from Morton. On Hogmanay 2008 his loan spell expired, so he returned to Morton with only six-months to earn himself a new contract at the club. In the January 2009 transfer window, Stevenson rejoined Jim McInally at his new club East Stirlingshire on loan until the end of the season. It was announced that Stevenson would be released after the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season, this was confirmed by Davie Irons on the 8 May in the Greenock Telegraph. On 9 July 2009, Stevenson signed permanently for the Shire. He was released at the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season but re-signed on a one-month short term contract at the start of the following season. There was talk of Stevenson joining up with ex- Morton defender Ryan Harding again on the Mediterranean island of Malta to play for league champions Birkirkara ‚Äì this however did not materialise. On 16 September 2010, he signed on a contract with Airdrie United until the end of the season. Following the expiry of his contract at Airdrie United he went on trial at SPL club Inverness Caledonian Thistle however he remained unsigned and returned to Airdrie in August 2011. In June 2012, Stevenson signed for Cowdenbeath to play in the First Division. After two seasons with Cowdenbeath, he signed for Peterhead.Peterhead sign Stevenson, spfl.co.uk; accessed 8 June 2017.

It was built by Emaar Properties Group. Overview The tower is the twenty-second tallest building in Dubai. It is a tall structure within the massive development named Downtown Dubai, which includes the centerpiece super-tall building, the Burj Khalifa. The tower was topped out in April 2008, and was then the sixth tallest building in Dubai. The AED845 million tower was completed in September 2008. The five-star hotel and residential compound features 196 rooms and 626 serviced apartments. Thanks to its proximity to Burj Khalifa and The Dubai Fountain these hotels are well mentioned among the most beautiful hotel views in Dubai. 2015 fire Around 21:00 GST on 31 December 2015, a fire broke out on the 20th floor of the building. The floor where the fire is thought to have begun hosts residential suites. The nearby Dubai Mall was also evacuated as a precaution. Dubai's Media Office said the fire began on a 20th-floor terrace. Explosions of unknown origin were heard as the fire spread to other parts of the building. Then, debris fell from the building and dark plumes of smoke were seen emanating from the skyscraper. Commenting on the speed with which the fire spread, Jonathan Gilliam, a CNN law-enforcement analyst, said, \\"This is looking absolutely horrific. This is spreading very rapidly.\\" A representative of Dubai Civil Defence said four separate teams of firefighters had fought the blaze. Once the fire was contained, the plan was to ensure that the fire did not spread by implementing cooling procedures, and to search for any stranded individuals, according to Dubai Police Chief, Major-General Khamis Mattar Al Mazeina. According to the Dubai Media Office, 14 people were slightly injured and one was moderately injured. One person had a heart attack during the evacuation. Photographer Dennis Mallari was setting up to photograph the Dubai fireworks when he became trapped on a balcony on the 48th floor of the hotel, 10 meters away from the blaze. He sent text messages alerting the authorities to his emergency, sought help by Facebook posts, and filmed the encroaching fire, and eventually tied a rope around himself to a nearby window-cleaning platform and hung off a balcony before being rescued. Those who sustained smoke inhalation and minor injuries were treated by 20 doctors and 50 nurses from the Dubai Health Authority at the site, according to Al Mazeina. Director-General of Dubai Civil Defence, Major General Rashid Thani Rashid Al Matroushi, said that all of the hotel residents were evacuated, none of the injured were children, and that fire \\"broke out only in the external interface and the majority of the fire did not make it to the inside.\\" Several people at the site complained that neither the fire alarm nor the sprinkler system activated during the fire. It was reported that the hotel was probably packed with guests due to its clear view of the New Year's fireworks display at Jumeirah Beach (including Burj Al Arab) and Burj Khalifa. The show still went on as planned, but with some flaws in the LED programming; by midnight, authorities had deemed the fire to be 90 percent contained. The following day, smoke continued to rise from the building. Criticism was leveled towards the high amount of cladding--layers of material that are fixed to the outside of buildings for insulation--implemented into the building's design; it was reported that this cladding may have contributed to the fire's spread. On 20 January 2016, Dubai Police held a news conference to confirm that the fire was caused by an electrical short circuit. The forensic investigation has identified that the short circuit was caused by electrical wires of the spotlight used to illuminate the building between the 14th and the 15th floor. After the onsite investigation, experts identified that the fire broke out in the duct between flat numbers 1401 and 1504. Experts have conducted further investigation in flat number 1504 and have drawn conclusion that the fire spread to the unit from the side of the window, which is connected to the ledge and the falling debris caused the fire in flat number 1401. The police released photographs during the news conference which show the exposed unconnected wire in the duct between the two apartments. The fire was first reported by a guest who was residing on the 18th floor of the building where he called the reception to inform that he could smell something burning and visited the reception minutes later after he began to notice the smoke. Emaar provided housing for those whose apartments were affected by the fire, but some residents complained that the housing was inferior to that they had lost. Hotel guests are still waiting to be compensated for the lost items and trauma suffered as a result of the fire. They cannot obtain a precise update from the hotel group nearly 2 years after the fire.

In 1618 or 1619 both Rowley and William Hannam had entered into a partnership with Sir Percival Willoughby by accepting a grant to half his land as described from a line drawn from Carbonear to Heart's Content to include all land north of that line in exchange for development separate from the Cuper's Cove Colony. Disagreements with Hannam had delayed this plan but he did convince eight settlers from Cuper's Cove to settle Heart's Content in the winter of 1619. Then in 1620 he had abandoned the venture with Percival Willoughby citing he had not received legal title to the land.

The Formosa Plastics propylene explosion was a propylene release and explosion that occurred on October 6, 2005, in the Olefins II Unit at the Formosa Plastics plant in Point Comfort, Texas, United States. The subsequent fire burned for five days. Formosa Plastics Point Comfort facility The Point Comfort facility is the largest Formosa Plastics plant in the United States. Opened in 1983, it covers 1,800 acres (7.3 km¬≤) and employs 1,400 full-time employees and 400 contract workers. Among the employees are 120 personnel making up the plant's Emergency Response Team (ERT) whose members are trained in hazardous material emergencies and fire fighting. There are 17 operating units on the plant producing a variety of petroleum and plastic products. Olefins II Unit The Olefins II Unit uses furnaces to convert naphtha or natural gas into a hydrocarbon mixture containing methane, ethane, ethylene, propylene, and propane. Distillation columns separate the hydrocarbon mix. Some of the gases (such as propylene) are liquified and sent to storage while others are used to fuel the furnaces or are returned to the feedstock. The Unit is protected from overpressure by pressure relief valves which send gases into a flare system where the excess gases are burned at a distance from the Unit. However, on October 6, 2005, such valves were manually operated and could not be reached by workers in time to prevent the explosions. The Explosions The source of the leak. The trailer holding the canisters hit the piping to its right. The explosions began a little after 3pm on October 6, 2005. The resulting fires reached reported heights of up to 800 feet in the air and were visible from nearby towns. The fires burned for nearly a week. On October 6, 2005, around 15:05CDT (20:05 UTC), a trailer being pulled by a forklift caught on a valve in the propylene piping system near the Olefins II Unit, pulling the valve and part of the piping loose, leaving a 1.9 inch (3.5 cm) hole. Pressurized liquid propylene poured out of the opening, partially vaporizing, leaving a pool of liquid propylene and creating a flammable vapor cloud. The forklift driver and other nearby contractors saw the cloud and immediately evacuated the area. A plant operator heard the escaping propylene and the expanding vapor cloud. He notified the plant's control room of the problem. The control room operators saw the leak on a closed circuit television and began to shut down the plant. However, valves that would have prevented further release of chemicals had to be shut off manually. Operators in the vicinity of the leak attempted to reach manual shutoff valves but were driven back by the vapor cloud. As a result, the explosions continued and the fires grew. Fire monitors were turned on. At approximately 15:07 (20:07 UTC), the vapor cloud ignited knocking down several operators who were exiting the unit, severely burning two of them. The explosion led control room operators to declare a site-wide evacuation order. Shortly thereafter, the control operators began to smell propylene and also evacuated the control center. Yards away from the spreading fire was an area of the plant where flammable chemicals were stored in mass quantities. As the fire continued to spread, workers and contactors were confronted with the very real possibility that the storage tanks would ignite if the fire reached them. Experts estimate that had such an ignition occurred, the entirety of Point Comfort would have been incinerated. Some experts estimate such an ignition would cause even more expansive damage. Reportedly, hundreds of plant workers and contractors ran toward the gates to evacuate. Many workers who evacuated to gate 6 were met with disappointment when they found the gate to be locked and no one present to unlock it. As a result, many workers jumped the fence in an attempt to flee from the continuing explosions. The explosion had ignited the propylene pool under the leak and the flames spread up the side of a structure containing several vessels, heat exchangers and pressure relief valves. The local authorities immediately attempted to issue a shelter in place order to the surrounding community with the exception of Point Comfort Elementary School. However, due to an error in programing, an \\"all clear\\" alarm was erroneously sounded. The students and teachers were evacuated to Port Lavaca, about five miles (8 km) away. State Highway 35 was shut down as it runs adjacent to the plant. The shelter order was rescinded at 21:00 (02:00 UTC on October 7, 2005). The emergency response team assumed command of the incident and began attacking the fire. At the time of the explosion, two of the off-duty ERT crews were on site for training so a total of 90 members of the ERT were available to respond. At about 15:35 (20:35 UTC), the side of the structure collapsed causing the emergency vent lines to be crimped. The crimped lines, softened by the heat of the flames, ruptured and burst into flames. The emergency response team isolated as many fuel sources as possible and allowed smaller fires to burn off the uncontained hydrocarbons. It took five days for all of the fires to be extinguished. For a period of time, the fires blazed up to 800 ft in the air. The accident injured an unknown number of workers, four with severe burns requiring hospitalization. Many others were treated for exhaustion, pulmonary problems, and debilitating physical injuries. As yet, the effect on the residents of Calhoun County from the chemicals released by Formosa in the month following the explosions is widely unknown. Over a thousand members of the County have filed complaints against Formosa and others because of the explosions and subsequent release of chemicals. Investigation and findings The Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board found that while Formosa Plastics did have procedures in place for vehicles speed limits, crane use and a vehicle permitting process, there were no guidelines or restrictions on where vehicles may operate inside the plant. It was also determined that the piping was not properly protected from potential impact as stated in regulations for such facilities. Structural fire protection Investigation photo showing the destruction of the non-fireproofed columns vs. columns that were fireproofed. On the structure that collapsed, only three of the four supporting columns were covered with a fireproofing material. The columns that supported the pressure relief valves and emergency vent piping had no fireproofing at all. The columns that were not fireproofed bent in the ensuing fire while the fireproof columns were found upright during the after-accident investigation. The American Petroleum Institute issued a recommendation in July 1988 that steel supporting pressure relief and emergency flare lines should be fireproofed. The recommendation had been issued prior to construction of the Olefins II Unit. Isolation of equipment The operators working in the unit at the time of the incident were unable to reach manual shut-off valves that would have isolated the damaged section from a fuel source. A remotely operated shut-off valve was located between the damaged section and the storage tanks but not between the damaged section and the distillation column. In addition, the pumps were controlled from a local control station that was also inaccessible. The pumps were eventually shut down from the central control building but there was not a remote shutdown control for the pumps in the central control room. Isolating the damaged section via a remotely operated valve upstream of the pumps could have ended the incident prior to ignition of the vapor cloud and would have definitely reduced the severity of the situation. Recommendations The CSB recommended that Formosa Plastics needed to revise policies for their hazard analysis to have a better evaluation of vehicle impact hazards, fireproofing and prevention or minimization of hazardous material releases. CSB also recommended fire resistant clothing for workers in any units at the Point Comfort complex that had a risk of flash fires. In addition to Formosa Plastics, the safety board had recommendations for Kellogg, Brown and Root, the designers of the Olefins II unit. They had also had designed the original Olefin unit (Unit I) and had sold the same design plan to Formosa for Unit II as well as to other companies. The plant design had never been updated to account for new recommendations and requirements for safety standards. The safety board recommended that KBR advise all owners of similar plant designs of the potential problems and that KBR review all of its existing plant designs for safety updates before selling them to future clients. Penalties The Occupational Safety and Health Administration found that Formosa Plastics had committed one willful violation of \\"failure to provide employees with flame resistant clothing for protection against flash fire hazards\\". OSHA also cited Formosa for 13 other violations and fined the company $148,000.

Coronal and solar wind plasma The coronal and solar wind plasmas are highly electrically conductive, meaning the magnetic field lines and the plasma flows are effectively \\"frozen\\" together and the magnetic field cannot diffuse through the plasma on time scales of interest. In the solar corona, the magnetic pressure greatly exceeds the plasma pressure and thus the plasma is primarily structured and confined by the magnetic field. With increasing altitude through the corona, solar wind acceleration results in the flow momentum exceeding the restraining magnetic tension force and the coronal magnetic field is dragged out by the solar wind to form the HMF. The dynamic pressure of the wind dominates over the magnetic pressure through most of the Solar System (or heliosphere), so that the magnetic field is pulled into an Archimedean spiral pattern (the Parker spiralParker, E. N., \\"Dynamics of the Interplanetary Gas and Magnetic Fields\\", (1958) Astrophysical Journal, vol. 128, p.664) by the combination of the outward motion and the Sun's rotation. In near-Earth space, the IMF nominally makes an angle of approximately 45¬∞ to the Earth‚ÄìSun line, though this angle varies with solar wind speed. The angle of the IMF to the radial direction reduces with helio-latitude, as the speed of the photospheric foot point is reduced. Depending on the polarity of the photospheric foot point, the heliospheric magnetic field spirals inward or outward; the magnetic field follows the same shape of spiral in the northern and southern parts of the heliosphere, but with opposite field direction. These two magnetic domains are separated by a two current sheet (an electric current that is confined to a curved plane). This heliospheric current sheet has a shape similar to a twirled ballerina skirt, and changes in shape through the solar cycle as the Sun's magnetic field reverses about every 11 years. Magnetic field at Earth orbit A video simulation of Earth's magnetic field interacting with the (solar) interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) The plasma in the interplanetary medium is also responsible for the strength of the Sun's magnetic field at the orbit of the Earth being over 100 times greater than originally anticipated. If space were a vacuum, then the Sun's magnetic dipole field, about 10‚àí4 teslas at the surface of the Sun, would reduce with the inverse cube of the distance to about 10‚àí11 teslas. But satellite observations show that it is about 100 times greater at around 10‚àí9 teslas. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) theory predicts that the motion of a conducting fluid (e.g. the interplanetary medium) in a magnetic field, induces electric currents which in turn generates magnetic fields, and in this respect it behaves like a MHD dynamo. The interplanetary magnetic field at the Earth's orbit varies with waves and other disturbances in the solar wind, known as \\"space weather\\". The field is a vector, with components in the radial and azimuthal directions as well as a component perpendicular to the ecliptic. The field varies in strength near the Earth from 1 to 37 nT, averaging about 6 nT.Glossary, interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), Southwest Research Institute. Retrieved 11 February 2020.

History In 1979, Kelme sponsored the mountains classification in the Vuelta a Espa√±a. The owners of Kelme were not satisfied with the publicity that this gave, so they decided to sponsor a cycling team instead. The Kelme team was formed from another Spanish cycling team, named Transmallorca in 1980. From 2004 cycling season Valencian government took the main sponsorship, Kelme becoming co- sponsor, finally dropping from the team at the end of the year. Despite this, team kept on running, but its days were numbered when on 20 August 2006, because of doping allegations on Operaci√≥n Puerto, Valencian government dropped its sponsorship. This was to become the last year for the oldest team in the peloton. The last couple of years, it was managed by Vicente Belda, former cyclist who was riding for the team from 1980 to 1988. Famous former riders included Alejandro Valverde, Roberto Heras, Aitor Gonz√°lez, Oscar Sevilla, √Ångel Casero and Fernando Escart√≠n. Team's major results include wins in the Vuelta a Espa√±a 2 times: in 2000 by Roberto Heras and Aitor Gonz√°lez back in 2002.  Doping controversy  In March 2004 in an exclusive interview with the Spanish newspaper As, the former Kelme cyclist Jes√∫s Manzano exposed the systematic doping in the team. During the interview he detailed blood doping as well as the various performance-enhancing drugs he used while on the team. Immediately the Kelme team denied the allegations and Jean-Marie Leblanc the director of the Tour de France was also sceptical about the allegations. After more detailed revelations, the Kelme team who had been invited to the 2004 Tour de France had their invite withdrawn. The subsequent investigation into his doping activities and the allegations he made led to the questioning of several members of the Kelme team in April 2004. These included Eufemiano Fuentes who was at that time the current Kelme team doctor, Walter Vir√∫ the team doctor before Fuentes, and Alfredo C√≥rdova who was working for Liberty Seguros but was involved with Kelme in 2003. An investigation began into the practises of Fuentes in early 2006 by Central Operating Unit, the anti-drug trafficking arm of the Spanish Guardia Civil. In May 2006, several arrests were made. Manzano's statements had led directly to the development of this investigation. In June 2007 Manzano claimed that Alejandro Valverde doped with testosterone during the 2002 Vuelta a Espa√±a.

Geography The landscape of Peermade includes spectacular waterfalls, open grass lands and pine forests.http://old.kerala.gov.in/kercaljan06/p38-41.pdf A Heaven away from Heaven / George Thengummoottil / PRD, Government of Kerala Predominantly it is classified as Malanad with an elevation ranging from from the mean sea level. History 1900 photograph of Peerumedu (British library) Peermade was once the summer retreat of the Maharajas of Travancore. During those periods these regions were quite inaccessible, covered by dense forests and was inhabited by certain tribes like 'Malappandarams' and 'Malayarans'. The archaeological excavations points out that there was an ancient Neolithic culture flourished in the high-ranges which wasn't written or recorded. But the findings of cultural remnants from the hill tracks near Kumily and Vandiperiyar provides some factual evidences of the existence of a rich culture. Peermade was the highest elevation on the mountain route that once connected the Travancore with Madurai in ancient Tamilakam. The mountain barriers created by the ghats separated these two regions. Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary, one of the largest wildlife reserves in India, is away. It has herds of elephants and other wildlife as well as lakes. Etymology The name is sometimes related to the Sufi saint, 'Peer Mohammed', as \\"hill of the Peer\\" (‡¥™‡µÄ‡¥∞‡µÅ‡¥Æ‡µá‡¥ü‡µç).http://www.theindia.info/peermade/ Story of Tea Plantation in Kerala / George Thengummoottil Spices The area is extremely fertile and until recently featured lush plantations of coffee, tea, cardamon, and coconut. With a long history of spice growing, the focus is now on the production of organic black pepper, white pepper, ginger and turmeric. At a 2006 show, spice growers from Peermade displayed samples of organically grown spices including cardamom, black pepper, white pepper, nutmeg, mace, cloves, turmeric, ginger, vanilla beans, vanilla powder and herbs such as oregano, sage, thyme and rosemary. Oils of thyme and rosemary were also displayed.

With almost 1000 attorney members nationwide, the organization consists of a dean, a governing board of regents, a founding membership, a sustaining membership and a general membership, and is headquartered in Montgomery, Alabama. Additionally, there is a State Delegate selected for each state. History and purpose The College was founded in 1994 in Chicago by 12 DUI defense attorneys, who formed the original Board of Regents. Subsequently each served as dean of the college for one year prior to automatically retiring from the board as a fellow of the National College. As the original board retired, new Regents were brought in to serve. The college's mission statement states that \\"In sum, the mission of the College is to vindicate the promise of the United States Constitution, that a citizen accused has the right to the effective assistance of his or her counsel\\". As part of this mission, the College presents seminars to the profession on a regular basis. These include a 3-day summer session conducted annually at the Harvard Law School since 1995; a 3-day fall seminar in Las Vegas, Nevada, in conjunction with the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers; a spring Mastering Scientific Evidence seminar in New Orleans, and a 2-day winter seminar at changing locations. Accreditation In 1999, the college instituted board certification to recognize lawyers within the college who exemplify the program's standards, and who meet the criteria established by the board: extensive experience trying DUI cases and litigating pre-trial issues, a broad knowledge of the science involved in testing for intoxicants, and a command of the legal process on which DUI cases are framed. In 2003, the American Bar Association recognized DUI Defense Law as a specialty area in the practice of law, and awarded its \\"Certificate of Accreditation\\" to the board certification program. In 2008 the American Bar Association re-accredited the National College's specialty certification program in DUI Defense Law. The NCDD is currently the only organization in the country accredited to certify lawyers as DUI Defense Law specialists.

The design was a twisting tower with more than 75 storeys for residential use, costing about US$140 million. This design was regarded as a major addition to the Dubai skyline, but at the same time, the height of the project was a concern to Dubai's Department of Civil Aviation. In response to this issue, the project was scaled back to with 51 stories.  Construction  Construction of the project began in 2006. The concrete foundation raft for the building was poured about a year later in March 2007 by the Dubai Contracting Company and Ready Mix Beton. Some of concrete was poured between March 22 and March 23, which set a new construction record for a continuously poured concrete raft. The old pouring record was also held by Ready Mix Beton.

The gallery occupied two commercial spaces on the seventh floor of a building that was part of the midtown arts district including the Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of Non- Objective Painting, Helena Rubinstein's New Art Center, and numerous commercial galleries. The gallery exhibited important modern art until it closed in 1947, when Guggenheim returned to Europe. The gallery was designed by architect, artist, and visionary Frederick Kiesler.Biography Retrieved June 25, 2010 The gallery The gallery showcased works by established European artists with an emphasis on Surrealism, and also exhibited the works of lesser known American artists, often for the first time. The space became both a meeting place and exhibition nexus for exiled European artists and young emerging Americans and as such was one of the major crucibles for the emergence of the New York School. The European artists that were exhibited at the Art of This Century Gallery included Leonora Carrington, Jean Arp, Georges Braque, Victor Brauner, Giorgio de Chirico, Salvador Dal√≠, Max Ernst, Alberto Giacometti, Wassily Kandinsky, Fernand L√©ger, Andr√© Masson, Roberto Matta, Joan Mir√≥, Pablo Picasso and Yves Tanguy. The American artists shown at the gallery included William Baziotes, Alexander Calder, Joseph Cornell, David Hare, Hans Hofmann, Gerome Kamrowski, Willem de Kooning, Robert Motherwell, Jackson Pollock, Richard Pousette-Dart, Ad Reinhardt, Mark Rothko, Charles Seliger, Clyfford Still, and Robert De Niro, Sr. Gallery spaces Art of This Century was divided into four distinct spaces: the Abstract Gallery, the Surrealist Gallery, the Kinetic Gallery, and the Daylight Gallery. The Abstract, Surrealist, the Kinetic Galleries showcased the permanent private collection which Peggy Guggenheim had amassed in Europe with the assistance of curator Herbert Read and artist Marcel Duchamp. The Daylight Gallery was a commercial gallery, used for the fifty-three temporary exhibitions featuring the work of one-hundred-and-three artists that took place from the winter of 1942 to the summer of 1947. The Abstract Gallery was the entrance space featuring undulating walls of ultramarine canvas and a Thalo-blue-painted floor. All of the paintings were suspended within the room from either diamond-shaped or inverted-pyramid rope modules or from parallel or V-shaped straps. Some sculptures were also suspended midair within these modules. As in all the gallery spaces, Frederick Kiesler's Correalist furniture units also served as easels for paintings and pedestals for sculpture. One of the most- recognized and reproduced exhibition spaces of the twentieth century, the Surrealist Gallery was Frederick Kiesler's design masterpiece. Within the long black-painted room, hanging curvilinear wall units displayed all the Surrealist works jutting out toward the viewer on adjustable arms. As originally presented, spotlights illuminated the paintings individually in a random electrically controlled sequence. At times the gallery was plunged into complete darkness accompanied by the ominous sound of an oncoming train. The Kinetic Gallery was a darkened hall-like space often likened to a carnival funhouse. Viewers were invited to interact with the displays. A biomorphic spiral-shaped ship's wheel rotated the contents of Marcel Duchamp's \\"Box in a Valise\\" where the components were viewed through a peephole. Activated by an invisible electric light beam, a paternoster lift display (resembling a mechanical ferris wheel) rotated small works by Paul Klee in front of the viewer. The Daylight Gallery, so-called because the two front rooms faced picture windows on 57th Street, was a normal rectilinear gallery with white walls. All of Guggenheim's temporary exhibitions took place here, including the New York debuts of William Baziotes, Robert De Niro (Sr.), David Hare, Robert Motherwell, Jackson Pollock, and Charles Seliger and important early exhibitions of Richard Pousette-Dart, Mark Rothko, and Clyfford Still. This space also contained Kiesler's mobile Painting Libraries, wheeled easel units with projecting glass rods which allowed viewer's to study works while seated on Correalist Instruments. Avant-garde during World War II Abstract Art was not new to the New York artists. The group called the American Abstract Artists (AAA) was established in 1935. Many of its members left New York in 1942 during World War II, to join the US Armed Forces. During the war years there were few male vanguard American artists remaining in New York. Generally the only artists or critics who did not participate in World War II were those exempt from military service or conscientious objectors. These male artists along with a few female artists captured the few galleries who were willing to show their work along with European modernists. This group of artists was called the Uptown Group. Uptown Group prior to 1945 *Adolph Gottlieb *David Hare *Robert Motherwell *Jackson Pollock *Richard Pousette-Dart *Ad Reinhardt *Theodoros Stamos Barnett Newman, a well-respected writer and critic who also organized exhibitions and wrote catalogs became only later a member of the Uptown Group. Jackson Pollock had his first solo show in 1943 at the Art of This Century Gallery, which provided him with a yearly stipend. He together with his wife the painter Lee Krasner, left New York City in 1945 and moved to the Springs, East Hampton, Long Island. Clyfford Still, a Californian who at the end of 1945 moved to New York, soon joined the Uptown Group and became associated with the prestigious uptown gallery: The Art of This Century. Thomas B. Hess, managing director of Art News described the Uptown Group: :Newman, Gottlieb, Rothko and Still each thought (and thinks) himself the greatest painter in the world. That one might owe a debt to another becomes not a matter of simple ordinary fact, but a major issue of debate-like a trial for high treason. They made a tactical alliance, not a team, nor a group style, nor even a tendency. (Barnett Newman, Thomas B. Hess, New York: Walker, 1969)  Exhibition by 31 Women  From January 5 to February 6, 1943, the gallery hosted the first of two exhibitions with exclusively women artists. Exhibition by 31 Women was juried, an unusual practice outside of Europe at the time, by a group that included prominent surrealists Andr√© Breton, Marcel Duchamp, Max Ernst, and others, including Guggenheim herself. Georgia O'Keeffe declined to participate, noting in a letter that she did not want to show as a \\"woman artist\\". The group of artists selected represented sixteen nationalities, and all but one (Djuna Barnes) were under the age of thirty: Xenia Cage, Leonora Carrington, Maria Elena Vieira da Silva, Eyre de Lanux, Leonor Fini, Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, Suzy Frelinghysen, Meraud Guinness, Anne Harvey, Valentine Hugo, Buffie Johnson, Frida Kahlo, Jacqueline Lamba (Breton), Gypsy Rose Lee, Aline Meyer Liebman, Hazel McKinley (Guggenheim, King-Farlow), Milena Pavloviƒá-Barilli, Louise Nevelson, Meret Oppenheim, Barbara [Reis] Poe Levee, Irene Rice Pereira, Kay Sage, Sonja Sekula, Gretchen Schoeninger, Esphyr Slobodkina, Hedda Sterne, Muriel Streeter, Dorothea Tanning, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, Julia Thecla, and Pegeen Vail Guggenheim, Peggy's daughter. Though not a commercial success, the exhibition was positively reviewed, but not devoid of chauvinism: a reviewer from Time magazine refused to cover the show because, he claimed, there were no worthy women artists. The second exhibition, \\"The Women\\", was on view June 12 ‚Äì July 7, 1945, featuring thirty-three women artists, some of whom had also taken part in the previous show. New artists included Nell Blaine, Louise Bourgeois, Lee Krasner, Charmion von Wiegand, and Catherine Yarrow. The exhibition's impact has been far-reaching: a new exhibition in 1997, Art of This Century: The Women; two perfumes named for the gallery and the exhibition, released by J. Crew; and a 2017 clothing collection by designer Jenny Packham that cited the concept as an inspiration. Closure Guggenheim closed the doors of The Art of This Century Gallery in May 1947. The representation of her artists was taken over by Betty Parsons, an artist and a prominent New York socialite.

He represented Yugoslavia in many competitions, including the 1962 Varna Olympiad, where he scored 6¬Ω out of 8 games for Yugoslavia, which finished second to the Soviet Union, and the 1970 Siegen Olympiad, where he scored 8¬Ω out of 10 for Yugoslavia, which finished third behind the Soviet Union and Hungary. Miniƒá also served as a second to Svetozar Gligoriƒá and Ljubomir Ljubojeviƒá, Yugoslavia's most prominent grandmasters. Miniƒá was famous for his knowledge of the game and great analytical ability. FIDE awarded him the International Master title in 1964, and the Honorary Grandmaster title in 1991. Death Miniƒá was found dead by friends in his Novi Sad apartment on April 9, 2005, after failing to respond to phone and intercom calls for several days.

Lloyd Thaxton (May 31, 1927 ‚Äì October 5, 2008) was an American writer, television producer, director, and television host best known for his syndicated pop music television program of the 1960s, The Lloyd Thaxton Show, which began as a local Los Angeles program on KCOP in September 1961. Life and career The son of a newspaperman, Thaxton was born in Memphis, Tennessee. On graduating from high school, Thaxton enlisted in the Navy, \\"barely hours\\" before he would have been drafted.Lloyd Thaxton blog Thaxton came to Los Angeles from Toledo, Ohio, in 1957, becoming, in his words, a \\"freelance announcer\\" and host of the highly rated Leave It to Lloyd talk show on KHJ-TV. He casually coined the term \\"freelance announcer\\" since his work in commercials was most active toward the end of the era of live television; Thaxton would go from venue to venue performing the commercials live, since videotape was not in wide use then. Many of his commercials for KHJ and KNXT were for the now-defunct Southern California discount chain, White Front. His career at KCOP began in 1958 both as a commercial announcer and as announcer for The June Levant Show, an afternoon talk show starring the wife of celebrated pianist Oscar Levant. This led to his own afternoon show, Lloyd Thaxton's Record Shop, in 1959. The program attracted quite a number of big-name guests, some of whom stopped by to promote their latest record and many of whom simply stopped by for the chance to chat with Thaxton. Among those early guests were Fred Astaire, Jerry Lewis, Johnny Green and Dimitri Tiomkin. In 1961 The Lloyd Thaxton Show (sometimes known as \\"The Lloyd Thaxton Hop\\") debuted on KCOP as an hour-long presentation from 5 to 6 p.m. The format, much along the lines of American Bandstand, featured local high school students dancing on the soundstage to the latest records. The show was almost totally unscripted and spontaneous. Thaxton's description of the idea: \\"No one told me what I had to do. I was producing it myself. I was writing it myself.\\" Thaxton frequently clowned around on stage to the music, lip-synching the vocals and accompanying the records on guitar or piano. One favorite recurring skit had the costumed Thaxton on his knees, impersonating painter Toulouse-Lautrec, while lip- synching a current song. He also occasionally \\"performed\\" on an odd contraption made from a tennis racket and a bow and arrow that roughly looked like a guitar and \\"play-synked\\" popular early-1960s instrumental tunes like \\"Scratchy\\" by Travis Wammack and various The Ventures and Link Wray guitar songs. The Lloyd Thaxton Show, with its mix of new music and comedy skits, immediately shot to Number One in the time period, with a viewership of at least 350,000 homes, including those on the East Coast. Many leading rock 'n' roll acts of the time, like The Byrds, Sonny & Cher, The Kinks, The Bobby Fuller Four, The Challengers and others appeared on the program. Thaxton would end each show by saying, \\"I'm Lloyd Thaxton,\\" followed by the teen audience shouting, \\"So what,\\" whereupon the Bill Black Combo instrumental of the same name would play. Although some cities carried his show almost from its inception, like KPTV in Portland, Oregon, The Lloyd Thaxton Show went into national syndication in late 1964, quickly becoming the highest rated musical entertainment program in the US for the next eight years. Lloyd Thaxton is today known as the father of music videos. Thaxton's ventures into other television programs and facets of the entertainment industry earned him five Emmy Awards and 15 Emmy nominations. His face appeared at the top of the newly launched Tiger Beat magazine (then known as \\"Lloyd Thaxton's Tiger Beat\\"), for which he did a column. According to IMDB, Thaxton was a co-founder of Tiger Beat magazine.IMDB bio During the late 1960s Thaxton hosted two short-lived game shows for ABC: Everybody's Talking (1967) and Funny You Should Ask (1968‚Äì69). He also was a radio talk show host on KABC-790 in Los Angeles from 1972-74. His Sunday show received positive reviews from the critics. Moving behind the scenes, in 1977 he created the syndicated game show Pro-Fan, which he also announced. Charlie Jones hosted the series. He also served as producer and director of the weekly consumer advocate show Fight Back! With David Horowitz from 1976‚Äì92, as well as producer for NBC's The Today Show. In 2003 Thaxton and motivational speaker John Alston co-wrote the best-seller Stuff Happens (and then you fix it), published by Wiley & Sons. Thaxton met his second wife, Barbara Snyder Whitman, on the set of the NBC summer series Showcase '68. They were married August 11, 1969. They had no children and remained married until his death from multiple myeloma in October 2008, which had been diagnosed in May of that year. He lived in Studio City, California, and was the head of his own entertainment firm, LT Productions, which is still active. Tributes His show was recalled in the lyrics of The Go-Go's song \\"Beatnik Beach,\\" which appeared on the 1982 album Vacation: \\"We'll lipsync a go-go / Like on the Lloyd Thaxton Show, yeah ...\\"\\"Beatnik Beach\\" lyrics, posted on the \\"Lyrics 007\\" website Thaxton was obliquely mentioned in a riff on the Mystery Science Theater 3000 takeoff of the movie Monster A Go-Go.

The river flows mostly through mountainous country and in several places through deep canyons. The towns of Sisian and Kubatly lie along its course.

His name is sometimes mispronounced as Toshiyoshi, but the kanji Âé≥ reading was passed down as \\"toshi\\" in the Yagy≈´ family. His Zokumy≈ç (first name taken at the time of the Genpuku) was originally Ch≈´jir≈ç, and his Kaimy≈ç (Dharma name) was Jo'un- sai ; though he is mostly remembered as Hy≈çgonosuke. He was favored by the old Sekish≈´sai over Munenori, who had been recommended to the Sh≈çgun. From 1603 to 1607, he served Kat≈ç Kiyomasa. Thereafter, he became an itinerant warrior. Beginning in 1615, he served Tokugawa Yoshinao, the founder of the Owari branch of the Tokugawa clan. He directly instructed Yoshinao in the Yagy≈´ Shinkage-ry≈´.  In legend  While the famous swordsman Miyamoto Musashi was staying in Nagoya, Musashi noticed a certain warrior walking in the street, in with a way of carrying himself that was striking to Musashi. Musashi then approached Hyogonosuke, and Hyogonosuke did the same. Musashi asked, \\"Aren't you Lord Yagyu Hyogonosuke?\\" Hyogonosuke replied, \\"I am. Aren't you Lord Miyamoto Musashi?\\". Though Musashi and Hyogonosuke had never once met each other at any time in the past, because of the way he carried himself, along with the certain martial energy that he emanated, it could not have been anyone else but Hyogonosuke. So instead of measuring each other in combat, Hyogonosuke and Musashi instead conversed like old friends within the house of Yagyu. Hyogonusuke also appears in \\"Musashi\\" by Eiji Yoshikawa.

It was previously a through-point on the N3, but was bypassed in 1999. The bridge in the village crosses the River Annalee, a tributary of the River Erne. A church dedicated to the local St. Aiden is located in the town. It is about via the N54 to the border with County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland. History The history of the Butlersbridge dates back around 6000 years to the Neolithic when farming arrived. The area fell within the domains of the O‚ÄôReilly clan until the Plantation of Ulster started in the early 17th Century which resulted in the O'Reilly's having their lands confiscated. The lands around Butlersbridge were given to an English tenant called Sir Stephen Butler, after whom the town is named. St Aiden's Church Butlersbridge's parish church is St Aidan's which was designed by the architect William Hague Jr. (1836-1899). It was built adjacent to the river Annalee on a site donated by the Earl of Lanesborough. Work commenced in 1860 and the church was dedicated on 14th June 1863. The church cost ¬£1,440 to build. The two shades of limestone used to build the church are typical of Hague's designs. Annagh Lake Annagh Lake is near Butlersbridge and forms part of the drainage system of the River Erne, the Lake has a fishery which is stocked with both brown trout and rainbow trout. Sports Butlersbridge has a GAA Club, Butlersbridge Emmett's, which was founded in 1888. The club has won a number of Cavan Junior Championships at Gaelic Football. Folk Village In 1977 the owners of the Derragarra Inn in Butlersbridge created a Folk Village as a tourist attraction and this was reported in an RT√â News report broadcast on 13 September 1977.

The bridge built in 1986 bypasses the central business district and replaced the Waubonsie Bridge truss bridge which opened in 1930 and went towards the middle of town. The Waubonsie Bridge built by the Kansas City Bridge Company called itself \\"The Bridge with a State park at Each End\\" because Arbor Lodge State Park was on the Nebraska side and Waubonsie State Park was on the Iowa side. The Waubonsie Bridge replaced a pontoon bridge built in 1888 that claimed to be the largest drawbridge of its kind in the world. The pontoon bridge was more than long and the middle of the bridge could swing open providing a -wide passage. Local usage refers to the new bridge just as \\"the Missouri River Bridge.\\" The bridge was constructed as part of a highway plan to provide four-lane access between Lincoln, Nebraska and Interstate 29 in Iowa.

It is roughly bound by North 20th Street to the south, I-195 to the north, I-95 to the west and Biscayne Bay to the east. In 2005, construction began on the \\"Midtown Miami\\" development between North 29th and 36th Street and Miami Avenue and the Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) on what was historically an FEC rail yard. The project is a large-scale, urban development that was planned with 8 high-rise residential buildings, a hotel, two parks, and a major urban shopping area, \\"The Shops at Midtown\\". Due to the collapse of the real estate bubble in 2007, only two residential buildings, and about 2/3 of \\"The Shops at Midtown\\" were built. In July 2011, plans were announced to begin construction on a new entertainment center at Midtown, including a hotel, and shops on the site of the current temporary park in the center of Midtown. Critics of Midtown state the lack of parks as a major issue.http://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/print- edition/2011/07/15/midtown-miami-developer-plans.html History Midtown has grown quickly, and is home to Shops at Midtown, an outdoor shopping area designed to mimic New York's SOHO neighborhood, and home to many national and local stores and restaurants including Target, Guess, HomeGoods, Marshalls, Sakaya Kitchen, Baru Urbano, Novecento & IT Lounge, Riviera Focacceria Italiana, Giraffas Brazilian Grill, Spris, Bar Louie, Wine Vault, 100 Montaditos, World of Beer, Chef Leon, Mercado Latino, My Ceviche, Five Guys Burgers & Fries, 4D Gelateria, Hurricane Grill & Wings, Lime Fresh Mexican Grill, Spun Candy, Pinkberry, SugarCane, Mercadito, Lagniappe, Sustain, Cheese Course, Buro Miami, Ring Finger Studio, and an abundance of upscale apartments. A fair amount of office businesses have also taken up residence in Midtown in office buildings, in industries ranging from interior decor to marketing agency services, and more. At B√ºro Urbano urban workspace, office spaces are provided for small businesses. Midtown has also become home to Art Miami art fair, which takes place during Miami's Art Basel week.

He made a false confession, which he withdrew, and his DNA was excluded from that left at the scene. He was nonetheless convicted, based on police testimony that he had confessed. He served sixteen years, although he continued to maintain his innocence and appealed his conviction. He requested post-conviction DNA testing, but the DA's office, then headed by Jeanine Pirro, refused to accept his lay request. After a new DA was elected and Deskovic gained support by the Innocence Project, in 2006 DNA testing was conducted for Deskovic. It excluded his DNA from the evidence at the crime scene. Significantly, the forensic DNA was found to match that of an inmate already serving time for murder. The latter man confessed to the attack on Correa and was convicted of her death. Deskovic was exonerated and released in 2006. He has become an advocate for criminal justice reform. In 2014 a jury found in favor of Deskovic and awarded him $41.6 million in a federal civil suit against the county for wrongful imprisonment. Due to his pretrial settlement with the county, Deskovic was limited to receive $10 million. He has set up a foundation to work for reform. Biography Jeffrey Deskovic was born in 1973 in Putnam County, New York. He attended public schools, including Peekskill High School. He was not popular at school, but had been helped with algebra by Anglea Correa, who was in his class and had been nice to him. On November 15, 1989 in Peekskill, New York, Correa disappeared after going out with a portable cassette player and a camera for a project for her photography class. Two days later her body was found, and police determined she had been raped and strangled. Deskovic was among the many students who attended her funeral; he was so distraught that he cried openly during the service. The police thought Deskovic was showing suspicious behavior and took him into custody as a potential suspect. They interrogated him at length. Deskovic later said that, under coercion, he made a false confession, fabricating an account based on crime scene information fed to him by police officers during their leading questions in the course of the interrogation. Deskovic also said: \\"By the police officer's own testimony, by the end of the interrogation I was on the floor crying uncontrollably in what they described as a fetal position\\".\\"An Innocent Man Speaks: PLN Interviews Jeff Deskovic\\", Prison Legal News, 15 August 2013 Although DNA testing at the time excluded Deskovic from the forensic DNA found in Correa's body, on December 7, 1990 a jury convicted Deskovic. They were apparently convinced by testimony from Peekskill police detective Daniel Stephens that the young man had confessed to the crime. Deskovic continued to proclaim his innocence on numerous occasions after his conviction. The office of Westchester County district attorney (DA) Jeanine Pirro, who took office after he was imprisoned, refused to accept his lay request to reopen the case. From at least 2000, Deskovic appealed to D.A. Pirro to run post-conviction DNA testing, as he believed it would prove his innocence. Pirro declined to run any DNA tests that could help release him from prison., New York Post Desckovic's case was taken by the Innocence Project, which provided him with defense counsel. They repeated his attempt to gain DNA testing. In 2006, the newly elected district attorney, Janet DiFiore, authorized DNA testing of Deskovic. It excluded his DNA from that found at the scene. The DNA from the crime scene was found to match that of Steven Cunningham, a man who was already serving a life term for another murder. Confronted with the DNA evidence, he later confessed and pleaded guilty to the Correa murder. Exoneration and release Deskovic's conviction was overturned and he was released from prison in 2006. A subsequent independent review of the case, written by retired judges Leslie Crocker Snyder and Peter J. McQuillan, along with former Staten Island D.A. William L. Murphy; and Richard Joselson of Legal Aid, criticized police and the former prosecutor for failure to pursue other leads and for downplaying the DNA evidence that led to Deskovic's exoneration. According to the report, errors were made throughout the entire case, including tunnel vision by both police and the previous prosecutor, along with reliance on profiling which turned out to be completely incorrect, followed by deliberate downplaying of the DNA evidence that ultimately proved Deskovic was innocent. Aftermath Jeffrey Deskovic now works as an advocate for reform of the criminal justice system. He educates the public through public speaking, published articles, and The Jeffrey Deskovic Foundation for Justice, which he established. He is a Mercy College alumnus.http://www.deskovic.org/articles/exonerated-mercy-alum-helping-others- gain- freedom/https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/25/us/25jeffrey.htmlhttps://theimpactnews.com/impact- now/2015/11/02/life-after-being-wrongfully-convicted-mercy-alum-jeffery- deskovics-story/ Deskovic filed a federal civil rights suit against Putnam County and the state for wrongful conviction and imprisonment. In October 2014 a jury found in his favor and awarded him $41.6 million: \\"$25 million for the time he spent wrongfully imprisoned, $15 million for his suffering, and the rest for lost wages over those years.\\" Based on a pre-trial settlement with the county, intended to limit the potential payout, Deskovic would receive a total of $10 million.

The band has had numerous lineup changes, with only Jon Howard remaining from the original incarnation. Biography Early years Threat Signal was formed in the summer of 2003 by cousins Jon and Rich Howard. Shortly after, they recruited local Hamilton guitarist Kyle McKnight and began writing/recording music. The three musicians posted their demo for the song \\"Rational Eyes\\" on an international metal chart on GarageBand.com. After a few weeks, the song reached No. 1, and had received many awards including best guitars, best drums, best male vocals, best production, song of the week, and song of the day. Success on GarageBand.com sparked some early record label interest and helped create a following even before the band had ever played live. In the spring of 2004, Adam Matthews joined the band as their first drummer. Several months later, Eric Papky would also join to handle the bass playing. With a full lineup in place, the band was ready to hit the stage. On December, 10th 2004, Threat Signal headlined their first show at The Underground in Hamilton. For the better part of 2005, Threat Signal would continue to write and record material for a full-length album. In the summer of 2005, they would part ways with bassist Eric Papky and have Marco Bressette enter the fold as a replacement. Nuclear Blast and Under Reprisal In September 2005, the band traveled to Los Angeles to record Under Reprisal with Christian Olde Wolbers of Fear Factory. During the recording process, Threat Signal parted ways with drummer Adam Matthews. In November 2005, the band announced they had signed a recording deal with Nuclear Blast records. The band was in need of a new drummer and this position was filled by George Parfitt in January 2006. Later that year in July, Threat Signal took part in Germany's Earthshaker Fest, alongside notable acts as Scar Symmetry, Communic, and Arch Enemy. On August 1, 2006, the band announced that guitarist Rich Howard had left the band to pursue other personal goals, and he was replaced by the band's bassist, Marco Bressette. This left the bass guitar duties vacant, and in late September Pat Kavanagh was announced as the new bassist. In October 2006, the band began a North American trek with Soilwork, Mnemic, and Darkest Hour. New material, touring and line-up changes In March 2007, Threat Signal began demoing new material, but was hampered by second departure, this time Marco Bressette's. The band announced a search for a new guitarist the same day, while guitarist Adam Weber would join the band temporarily to fill in for the remaining tour dates. Threat Signal was tapped as the opener for the Tour and Loathing trek alongside Protest the Hero, All That Remains, Blessthefall, and The Holly Springs Disaster. In the summer of 2007, Kyle McKnight announced his departure from Threat Signal. Shortly afterwards, George Parfitt would also leave the band. Replacements were made with Travis Montgomery on guitar and Norm Killeen on drums. By this time, Adam Weber had also become a full- time member. In 2008 Jon Howard and Pat Kavanagh joined Arkaea alongside ex- Fear Factory members Raymond Herrera on drums and Christian Olde Wolbers (who produced Threat Signal's debut Under Reprisal) on guitar. Vigilance Threat Signal's second album Vigilance, which was produced by Jon Howard (who is now the only founding member left in the band) and mixed by Greg Reely, was released on September 8, 2009 in North America and September 11, 2009 in Europe. The album spawned a music video for the track \\"Severed\\". On July 15 the band released a 32-minute \\"making of\\" video for the new record, containing footage of the recordings, song writing process and interviews with band members. The album sold around 1,100 copies in its first week of sale in the United States, with the band touring alongside Epica and later Dark Tranquillity to support the album. Second lineup change In July 2010 it was confirmed that Adam Weber had quit the band. Pat Kavanagh (bass, vocals) has issued the following statement: \\"Adam has decided to leave us. He has some personal things he needs to work out and we wish him all the best. We‚Äôre still good friends and there‚Äôs plenty more beers that we‚Äôll have together so no worries. I know this sucks to hear for a lot of you and I can list off a boat load of bands that have been through the same s*** we‚Äôve been through. Just know it sucks hard on our side too. On a positive note we have a huge head start on the next record. Even have a few demos already! You‚Äôll be hearing new s*** soon. So we hope to see you on the road with Soilwork, Mutiny Within and Kris Norris soon! Good times will be had by all!\\" Ex-Darkest Hour guitarist Kris Norris filled in for Adam's absence On September 13, 2010, the band posted an online statement that they also parted ways with drummer Norman Killeen. Both Adam and Norman were eventually replaced by drummer Alex R√ºdinger and guitarist Chris Feener. Threat Signal The band announced on their Facebook page that the third album will be produced and mixed by \\"musical mastermind\\" Zeuss (Chimaira, Hatebreed, All That Remains, The Acacia Strain, Born Of Osiris, Shadows Fall, etc.). They also stated that they experimented with 7 string guitars on this album. The band is quoted saying: \\"We are headed back to the Under Reprisal days but with bigger balls.\\" The band also stated that it will be a self-titled album. Threat Signal's self- titled new album \\"Threat Signal\\" was released on October 7, 2011 in Europe and on October 11, 2011 in North America. They toured with Children Of Bodom, Eluvieite, and Revocation in 2012 to promote the album. Third lineup change, Disconnect Alex R√ºdinger and Chris Feener have left the band and R√ºdinger has been replaced by Our Lady of Bloodshed drummer Joey Muha. On May 20, 2015, it was announced that touring guitarist; Matt Perrin, had officially joined the band. Along with that statement came news regarding the tracking of a new album within the month. On June 13, 2015, Joey Muha announced he left Threat Signal and will now be a full-time member of Jungle Rot. Drums for the band's fourth album, Disconnect, were done by Andrew Minarik. It was originally slated for 2016, but spent a year in development hell due to management and label problems. It was eventually released on November 10, 2017.

In people with PNH, it reduces both the destruction of red blood cells and need for blood transfusion, but does not appear to affect the risk of death. Eculizumab was the first drug approved for each of its uses, and its approval was granted based on small trials. It is given in a clinic by intravenous (IV) infusion. Side effects include a risk for meningococcal infections and it is only prescribed to those who have enrolled in and follow a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, which involves counseling people and ensuring that they are vaccinated. For label updates, see FDA index page for BLA 125166 It is a humanized monoclonal antibody functioning as a terminal complement inhibitor. It has been developed, manufactured, and marketed by Alexion Pharmaceuticals, which had patent exclusivity until 2017. Alexion started selling eculizumab in 2007 making $295 million in 2008 with its stock price rising 130% in 2010. In 2010, it was the most expensive drug in the world. It costs ¬£340,200 (approximately ‚Ç¨430,000) per year for ongoing treatment in the UK,Martin Wall Doctors must tell patients of errors, under new Varadkar law. Like a motoring ‚Äòhit and run‚Äô for doctors to fail to make such disclosures, says Minister Feb 5, 2015, Irish TimesHigh cost of treatment for rare blood disorder needs to be clarified, says NICE in draft guidance 04 March 2014, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. UK $500,000 a year in Canada, and US$409,500 a year in the United States (2010). In 2015, it was the 4th most expensive medication in the US on a per person treated basis.  Medical uses  Eculizumab is used to treat atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). For people with PNH, it improves quality of life and decreases the need for blood transfusions but does not appear to affect the risk of death. It does not appear to change the risk of blood clots, myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myelogenous leukemia, or aplastic anemia. Eculizumab is also used to treat neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder in adults who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive. Eculizumab is administered in a doctor's office or clinic by intravenous infusion. Women should not become pregnant while taking eculizumab and pregnant women should take it only if it is clearly necessary.  Adverse effects  Eculizumab carries a black box warning for the risk of meningococcal infections and can only be prescribed by doctors who have enrolled in and follow a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy required by the FDA, which involves doctors counseling people to whom they are prescribing the drug, giving them educational materials, and ensuring that they are vaccinated, all of which must be documented. Eculizumab inhibits terminal complement activation and therefore makes people vulnerable to infection with encapsulated organisms. Life-threatening and fatal meningococcal infections have occurred in people who received eculizumab. People receiving eculizumab have up to 2,000 times greater risk of developing invasive meningococcal disease. Due to the increased risk of meningococcal infections, meningococcal vaccination is recommended at least 2 weeks prior to receiving eculizumab, unless the risks of delaying eculizumab therapy outweigh the risk of developing a meningococcal infection, in which case the meningococcal vaccine should be administered as soon as possible. Both a serogroup A, C, W, Y conjugate meningococcal vaccine and a serogroup B meningococcal vaccine are recommended for people receiving eculizumab. Receiving the recommended vaccinations may not prevent all meningococcal infections, especially from nongroupable N. meningiditis. In 2017, it became clear that eculizumab has caused invasive meningococcal disease despite vaccination, because it interferes with the ability of antimeningococcal antibodies to protect against invasive disease. The drug's labels also carry warnings of severe anemia arising from the destruction of red blood cells as well as severe cases of blood clots forming in small blood vessels. Headaches are very common adverse effects, occurring in more than 10% of people who take the drug. Common adverse effects (occurring in between 1% and 10% of people who take the drug) include infections (pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infection, colds, and urinary tract infection), loss of white blood cells, loss of red blood cells, anaphylactic reaction, hypersensitivity reaction, loss of appetite, mood changes like depression and anxiety, a sense of tingling or numbness, blurred vision, vertigo, ringing in the ears, heart palpitations, high blood pressure, low blood pressure, vascular damage, peritonitis, constipation, upset stomach, swollen belly, itchy skin, increased sweating, blotches from small bleeds under the skin and skin redness, hives, muscle spasms, bone pain, back pain, neck pain, swollen joints, kidney damage, painful urination, spontaneous erections, general edema, chest pain, weakness, pain at the infusion site, and elevated transaminases.  Pharmacology  Eculizumab specifically binds to the terminal complement component 5, or C5, which acts at a late stage in the complement cascade. When activated, C5 is involved in activating host cells, thereby attracting pro-inflammatory immune cells, while also destroying cells by triggering pore formation. By inhibiting the complement cascade at this point, the normal, disease-preventing functions of proximal complement system are largely preserved, while the properties of C5 that promote inflammation and cell destruction are impeded. Eculizumab inhibits the cleavage of C5 by the C5 convertase into C5a a potent anaphylatoxin with prothrombotic and proinflammatory properties, and C5b, which then forms the terminal complement complex C5b-9 which also has prothrombotic and proinflammatory effects. Both C5a and C5b-9 cause the complement-mediated events that are characteristic of PNH and aHUS. The metabolism of eculizumab is thought to occur via lysosomal enzymes that cleave the antibody to generate small peptides and amino acids. The volume of distribution of eculizumab in humans approximates that of plasma.  Chemistry  Eculizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against the complement protein C5. It is an immunoglobulin G-kappa (IgGŒ∫) consisting of human constant regions and murine complementarity- determining regions grafted onto human framework light and heavy chain variable regions. The compound contains two 448-amino acid heavy chains and two 214-amino acid light chains, and has a molecular weight of approximately 148 kilodaltons (kDa). Society and culture Regulatory approval Eculizumab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2007 for the treatment of PNH, Eculizumab has exclusivity rights until 2017, which protects it from competition until 2017. When the FDA approved it in September 2011 for the treatment of aHUS, it designated it as an orphan drug. The 2011 FDA approval was based on two small prospective trials of 17 people and 20 people. The European Medicines Agency approved it for the treatment of PNH in June 2007, and in November 2011 for the treatment of aHUS. Health Canada approved it in 2009 to treat PNH and in 2013 as the only drug to treat aHUS. Eculizumab was approved by the FDA for AQP4+ NMO in 2019, based on the results of the PREVENT trial.  Price  As of 2014 there was insufficient evidence to show that eculizumab therapy improves life expectancy for people with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and the cost-effectiveness was poor. In 2010 Alexion priced Soliris as the most expensive drug in the world, at approximately US$409,500 a year in the United States (2010), ‚Ç¨430,000 per year for ongoing treatment in the UK, and $500,000 a year in Canada (2014). Alexion started selling Soliris in 2008, making $295 million in 2007 with its stock price rising to 130% in 2010. In December 2013, New Zealand's government pharmaceutical buyer Pharmac declined a proposal to subsidize the drug after Alexion refused to budge on a NZ$670,000 (US$590,000) per person per year price and Pharmac's economic analysis determined the price would need to be halved before the drug was cost-effective enough to subsidize. Pharmac's decision upset many people with PNH in New Zealand PNH, although Pharmac has not ruled out reviewing the decision at a later date, should the drug be made available at a lower price. According to a 2014 report, the orphan drug market has become increasingly lucrative for a number of reasons. The cost of clinical trials for orphan drugs is substantially lower than for other diseases ‚Äîtrial sizes are naturally much smaller than for more common diseases that affect more people. Small clinical trials and little competition place these orphan agents at an advantage when they come up for regulatory review. Further reduction to the cost of development is because of the tax incentives in the Orphan Drug Act of 1983. On average the cost per person for orphan drugs is \\"six times that of non-orphan drugs, a clear indication of their pricing power\\". Although there are much smaller orphan disease populations, the cost of per-person outlays are the largest and are expected to increase with wider use of public subsidies. In December 2014, the provincial government of Ontario, Canada negotiated the price with the manufacturer, the only drug approved by Health Canada to treat aHUS. People can apply for it on \\"compassionate grounds\\" \\"on a case-by-case basis for example individuals who have been urgently hospitalized due to an immediate life-, limb-, or organ- threatening complication.\\" It then was already \\"funded by the Ontario government for the treatment of another rare illness, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), through a bulk-buy deal reached by the provincial premiers in 2011.\\" In February 2015, Canada‚Äôs drug-price regulator took the rare step of calling a hearing into Soliris, accusing Alexion of exceeding the permissible price cap under the \\"\\"Highest International Price Comparison\\"\\" (HIPC). In June 2015, the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB) under the Canadian Patent Act, held a preliminary hearing in Ottawa, Ontario to examine allegations. John Haslam, President and General Manager of Vaughan, Ontario-based Alexion Canada, was named as one of the respondents. Alexion charges Canada $700,000 per person per year, more than anywhere else in the world. Alexion denies the claim. In Canada \\"provincial drug plans have already negotiated secret discounts on Soliris for many of the patients they cover.\\" As of 2015, while Eculizumab in PNH was associated with 1.13 additional life years and 2.45 quality of life years QALYs, there has been a high incremental cost (CAN$5.24 million) and a substantial opportunity cost. A 2014 Canadian study calculated the cost per life-year-gained with treatment as CAN$4.62 million (US$4,571,564) and cost per quality-adjusted-life-year as CAN$2.13 million (US$2,112,398).\\"The incremental cost per life year and per QALY gained is CAN$4.62 million and CAN$2.13 million, respectively. Based on established thresholds, the opportunity cost of funding eculizumab is 102.3 discounted QALYs per patient funded.\\" By 2015, industry analysts and academic researchers agreed that the high price of orphan drugs, such as eculizumab, was not related to research, development, and manufacturing costs: their price is arbitrary and they have become more profitable than traditional medicines. Sachdev Sidhu, a University of Toronto scientist, who spent ten years at Genentech before academia, estimated that public science was responsible for well over 80% of the work. \\"Public resources went into understanding the molecular basis of the disease, public resources went into the technology to make antibodies and finally, Alexion, to their credit, kind of picked up the pieces.\\" The cost of manufacturing Soliris' monoclonal antibodies is less than \\"1 percent of the price of the drug,\\" he said. Brazil's supreme court had decided in April 2018 to break the patent of Soliris in Brazil following local law. This medicine was only provided by the government's health system (SUS) and now it can be produced by other companies in that country. Biosimilar competition While the FDA will not approve biosimilar applications for Eculizumab before 16 March 2019, there is an ongoing debate over the length of exclusivity periods. National regulators protect orphan drug producers from competition with biosimilar products through a multi-year exclusivity period, it is challenged as markets open and international trade deals are negotiated ‚Äîsuch as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). A generic version, branded \\"Elizaria'\\", is available in Russia.

In it he used statistical data to analyze the makeup of Southern society, contending that yeoman farmers made up a larger middle class than was generally thought.Carey (2001)  Historical perspectives  Historians have long debated the social, economic, and political roles of Southern classes. Terms used by scholars for the non-elite class include \\"common people\\" and \\"yeomen.\\" At a lower status level are the poor whites known disparagingly, in some areas of the South, as \\"Crackers.\\"Hyde (2005) In the colonial and antebellum years, subsistence farmers tended to settle in the back country and uplands. They generally did not raise commodity crops and owned few or no slaves. Jeffersonian and Jacksonian Democrats favored the term \\"yeoman\\" for a land-owning farmer. It emphasized an independent political spirit and economic self-reliance.Campbell (1987)  Views of Olmsted, Dodd, and Phillips  Northerners such as Frederick Law Olmsted, who traveled in and wrote about the 1850s South, through the early 20th-century historians such as William E. Dodd and Ulrich B. Phillips, assessed common southerners as minor players in antebellum social, economic, and political life of the South. Twentieth-century romantic portrayals of the antebellum South, such as Margaret Mitchell's novel Gone with the Wind (1936) and the 1939 film adaptation, mostly ignored the yeomen. The nostalgic view of the South emphasized the elite planter class of wealth and refinement, controlling large plantations and numerous slaves. Novelist Erskine Caldwell's Tobacco Road portrayed the degraded condition of whites dwelling beyond the great plantations.  Frank Lawrence Owsley  The major challenge to the view of planter dominance came from historian Frank Lawrence Owsley in Plain Folk of the Old South (1949). His work ignited a long historiographical debate.Hyde (1997) Owsley started with the work of Daniel R. Hundley, who in 1860 had defined the southern middle class as \\"farmers, planters, traders, storekeepers, artisans, mechanics, a few manufacturers, a goodly number of country school teachers, and a host of half-fledged country lawyers, doctors, parsons, and the like\\".Hundley (1860); Tommy W. Rogers, \\"D. R. Hundley: A Multi-Class Thesis of Social Stratification in the Antebellum South,\\" Mississippi Quarterly 1970 23(2): 135‚Äì154 To find these people, Owsley turned to the name-by-name files on the manuscript federal census. Using their own newly invented codes, the Owsleys created databases from the manuscript federal census returns, tax and trial records, and local government documents and wills. They gathered data on all southerners. Historian Vernon Burton described Owsley's Plain Folk of the Old South, as \\"one of the most influential works on southern history ever written\\".Vernon O. Burton, \\"Frank Lawrence Owsley,\\" in American National Biography, Volume 16 ed by John Arthur Garraty (1985) Plain Folk argued that southern society was not dominated by planter aristocrats, but that yeoman farmers played a significant role in it. The religion, language, and culture of these common people created a democratic \\"plain folk\\" society. Critics say Owsley overemphasized the size of the southern landholding middle class, while excluding the large class of poor whites who owned neither land nor slaves. Owsley believed that shared economic interests united southern farmers; critics suggest the vast difference in economic classes between the elite and subsistence farmers meant they did not have the same values or outlook.  Recent scholarship  In his study of Edgefield County, South Carolina, Orville Vernon Burton classified white society into the poor, the yeoman middle class, and the elite. A clear line demarcated the elite, but according to Burton, the line between poor and yeoman was less distinct. Stephanie McCurry argues that yeomen were clearly distinguished from poor whites by their ownership of land (real property). Yeomen were \\"self-working farmers\\", distinct from the elite because they physically labored on their land alongside any slaves they owned. Planters with numerous slaves had work that was essentially managerial, and often they supervised an overseer rather than the slaves themselves.Burton (1985) Wetherington (2005) argues the plain folk (of Georgia) supported secession to defend their families, homes, and notions of white liberty. During the war, the established patriarchy continued to control the home front and kept it functioning, even though growing numbers of plain folk joined the new wartime poor. Wetherington suggests that their localism and racism dovetailed with a republican ideology founded on Jeffersonian notions of an \\"economically independent yeomanry sharing common interests\\".Wetherington (2005) p, 12 Plain folk during the war raised subsistence crops and vegetables and relied on a free and open range to hunt hogs. Examples of these conditions can be seen in the award-winning novel Cold Mountain. Before the war, they became more active in the cotton and slave markets, but plain folk remained unwilling to jeopardize their self-sufficiency and the stability of their neighborhoods for the economic interests of planters. The soldiers had their own reasons for fighting. First and foremost, they sought to protect hearth and home from Yankee threats. White supremacy and masculinity depended on slavery, which Lincoln's Republicans threatened. Plain-folk concepts of masculinity explain why so many men enlisted: they wanted to be worthy of the privileges of men, including the affections of female patriots. By March 1862, the piney woods region of Georgia had a 60% enlistment rate, comparable to that found in planter areas.Wetherington (2005) As the war dragged on, hardship became a way of life. Wetherington reports that enough men remained home to preserve the paternalistic social order, but there were too few to prevent mounting deprivation. Wartime shortages increased the economic divide between planters and yeoman farmers; nevertheless, some planters took seriously their paternalistic obligations by selling their corn to plain folk at the official Confederate rate \\"out of a spirit of patriotism.\\"Wetherington (2005) p. 171 Wetherington's argument weakens other scholars' suggestions that class conflict led to Confederate defeat. More damaging to Confederate nationalism was the growing localism that grew, as areas had to fend for themselves as William Tecumseh Sherman's forces came nearer. During Reconstruction Era after the war, plain folk split. Most supported the conservative (or Democratic Party) position, but some were \\"Scalawags\\" who supported the Republicans for a while.Hahn (1983)  See also  *Culture of the Southern United States *Jeffersonian democracy *The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry, a farmers organization founded in 1867 and still in operation *Sharecropping, where the farmer does not own the land *Yeoman, the independent farmer  References   Further reading   Atack, Jeremy. \\"The Agricultural Ladder Revisited: A New Look at an Old Question with Some Data for 1860,\\" Agricultural History Vol. 63, No. 1 (Winter, 1989), pp. 1‚Äì25 in JSTOR * Atack, Jeremy. \\"Tenants and Yeomen in the Nineteenth Century,\\" Agricultural History, Vol. 62, No. 3, (Summer, 1988), pp. 6‚Äì32 in JSTOR *Bolton, Charles C. \\"Planters, Plain Folk, and Poor Whites in the Old South.\\" in Lacy K.

It is based in Springfield, Ohio and has a collection of approximately 500,000 items. History The Clark County Public Library traces its beginnings to the Springfield Lyceum in 1841 in Springfield, Ohio.. URL accessed 21 September 2006. Various short-lived library associations followed and the library found a more permanent home on the second floor of Black's Opera House. The library housed 3,300 volumes when it opened to the public at this location in 1872. As patronage and the collection expanded, the need for yet another move set in and the library relocated in 1877 to the second floor of the Union Hall Building, which was situated on what is today Fountain Avenue. Warder Literacy Center, formerly the Warder Public Library Local entrepreneur Benjamin Warder gave the library a new location on the corner of High Street in 1890, with a building constructed in memory of his parents and dedicated to the people of Springfield. This location now houses the Warder Literacy Center. Library service continued to expand and grow at this new location. The year 1936 saw the library's first bookmobile service to the area, with a homemade trailer that could carry 500 books. The 1950s and 1960s brought about the expansion of the library in the form of branches at Park Shopping Center, Southern Village Shopping Center, and in the villages of Enon and South Charleston. The main library moved from the Warder Public Library to its new facility on Fountain Avenue in 1989. The library has five locations throughout Clark County. It also has one bookmobile that covers 41 community stops, 7 schools, 14 daycare centers and 5 Head Start Programs. The library's collection includes over 425,000 books, 425 magazine subscriptions, 4,000 CDs, over 3,000 DVDs and Blu-ray (including an Express DVD collection), Video Games for check-out (Xbox One, Xbox 360, PS3, PS4, Wii and Wii U), eBooks and magazines, many online resources such as Gale Courses, full (in library) access to Ancestry.com and framed art for check-out (Main Library). The library offers many cultural and educational programs throughout the year at all of its branches. The Speaker Series (2000-2010) brought national and regional authors, artists, and lecturers to Springfield. Past participants included Sean Astin, Stan Lee, Maya Angelou, Dave Barry, Mary Higgins Clark, Doris Kearns Goodwin, and Elie Wiesel. The library's annual Summer Reading Program is popular with area children along with our weekly storytimes. Also on offer are different programs like LEGO Club, Teen TAC and Animanga Club, the Springfield Writes Local Author Fair, One-On-One Tech Classes and much more.

The programs contain a large library of polyhedra which can be manipulated and altered in various ways.  Polyhedra Polyhedra in Great Stella's library include the Platonic solids, the Archimedean solids, the Kepler-Poinsot solids, the Johnson solids, some Johnson Solid near-misses, numerous compounds including the uniform polyhedra, and other polyhedra too numerous to list here. Operations which can be performed on these polyhedra include stellation, faceting, augmentation, dualization (also called \\"reciprocation\\"), creating convex hulls, and others. All versions of the program enable users to print nets for polyhedra. These nets may then be assembled into actual three- dimensional polyhedral models of great beauty and complexity.  Stella4D  In 2007, a Stella4D version was added, allowing the generation and display of four-dimensional polytopes (polychora), including a library of all convex uniform polychora, and all currently known nonconvex star polychora, as well as the uniform duals. They can be selected from a library or generated from user created polyhedral vertex figure files. Features Stella provides a configurable workspace comprising several panels. Once a model has been selected from the range available, different views of it may be displayed in each panel. These views can also include measurements, symmetries and unfolded nets. A variety of operations may be performed on any polyhedron. In 3D these include: stellation, faceting, augmentation, excavation, drilling and dualising.

The collection includes more than 1,000 Russian icons and related artifacts, making it one of the largest private collections of Russian icons outside of Russia and the largest in North America. The icons in the collection range in date from the 15th century through to the present and covers almost the entire range of Russian icon images, symbols, and forms.  History  Interior of the Museum The Museum opened in October 2006. It began as the private collection of Gordon B. Lankton, a plastics engineer and former chairman and CEO of Nypro, Inc., a precision injection molding company now owned by Jabil Circuit. Lankton has been an avid traveler since he was stationed in Germany when he was in the Army. As outlined in his book The Long Way Home, Lankton took a motorcycle trip around the world in 1956 and 1957, visiting, in chronological order, Germany, Austria, Italy, Yugoslavia, Greece, Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, India, Ceylon, Nepal, Burma, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Hong Kong, and Japan. According to Lankton, he had wanted to visit Russia but was not allowed to do so during the Cold War.Museum of Russian Icons audio tour narration, accessed 1/2014 In 1989, Lankton first traveled to Russia to open a Nypro factory there. On that visit, he learned about iconographer Alyona Knyazeva and her icon school. After meeting Knyazeva and learning more about icons, Lankton began his collection, starting with a small, poor quality icon he found at a flea market in the Izmaylovo District of Moscow. Over the following 30 years, Lankton amassed several hundred icons. He displayed them at his home, at Nypro in a small gallery, and occasionally on loan to other museums, including the Higgins Armory Museum. As the collection grew and response to the informal sharing of his collection proved positive, Lankton decided to open his own museum directly across the street from Nypro. The Museum was incorporated in 2004, and Lankton purchased the building in early 2006. It opened to the public on October 15, 2006. Since then, two major expansion projects have taken place: in 2008, a research library and the South Gallery were added. In 2010, Lankton purchased the building immediately next door to the Museum and undertook a construction project to seamlessly join the two structures. The first phase of this project included the West Gallery and an expanded museum shop; the second phase included an expanded lower level with the Tea Room and auditorium.  Building  Both buildings that now make up the single museum property were originally associated with the Bigelow Carpet Mill. The second building, previously 195 Union Street, also served at one time as both the Clinton District Court and the Police Station. Both buildings were completely renovated on the interiors by David Durrant of Durrant Designs. Some historical details were retained and renovated, including the jail cells that were once part of the police station; and the period window frames in the West Gallery. The building now has more than 16,000 square feet of gallery space on three floors. Museum of Russian Icons: About Us.  Collection  The Museum collection includes more than 1,000 Russian icons and related artifacts. The icons range in date from 1450 to the present day and are installed in thematic groupings rather than chronological order. The Museum is particularly proud to display extremely rare Royal Doors that once led to the High Altar of an Orthodox Church in Russia and can be traced back to the 17th century. The Royal Doors have recently been added to the Museum's collection and are considered to be the \\"finest pair in the United States.\\"  Exhibitions  The Museum organizes its own exhibitions from the permanent collection and also hosts visiting exhibitions from other museums and collections. In 2008 and 2010, respectively the Museum co-organized exhibitions of icons from the Tretyakov Gallery and the Andrei Rublev Museum of Early Russian Art and Culture. Because of an embargo of art loans from Russia to the U.S., ongoing since 2011, the Museum has relied on exhibitions originating in the United States.  Center for Icon Studies  The Museum houses the Center for Icon Studies, the research arm of the institution that publishes the online Journal of Icon Studies. The journal is the only peer-reviewed publication exclusively devoted to Russian icons and related scholarship. Submissions to the journal are reviewed by members of the editorial board, which consists of twelve leading scholars in the field from the U.S., Europe, and Russia. The editorial board is composed of some of the leading researchers in the field of icon studies: * Amy Singleton Adams, College of the Holy Cross * Elena Boeck, DePaul University * Robin Cormack, Cambridge University * Michael Flier, Harvard University * Nancy Patterson-≈†evƒçenko, International Center of Medieval Art * Sarah Pratt, University of Southern California * Wendy Salmond, Editor, Chapman University * Vera Shevzov, Smith College * Engelina Smirnova, Moscow State Lomonosov University and Institute of Art Studies, Moscow * Oksana Smirnova, Andrey Rublev Museum of Old Russian Culture and Art * Raoul N.

It is Level-5's first project for the system. As of August 8, 2009 it has sold 350,000 copies in Japan. A sequel titled White Knight Chronicles II was released in Japan in 2010. A related game for the PlayStation Portable, titled White Knight Chronicles: Origins was released in Japan, Europe and, Australia in 2011. Gameplay White Knight Chronicles is a role-playing video game presented in a third-person perspective. The player can freely choose which character to control. The characters gain experience points and level up, becoming stronger over the course of the game. Level-5 conceived White Knight Chronicles to have 100 hours of gameplay, a length Akihiro Hino considers to be a full length role-playing game, going against the pressure to make White Knight Chronicles a launch title and cutting the story short. The player can select locations on a world map that the player has already visited to go to instantly, along with a preview of that area. Each area also has a quest list that shows quests the player has yet to complete. The player can choose a quest to embark upon before going to the desired area. The battle system used in White Knight Chronicles is a real-time system where the battle mode can be initiated when enemies are present. Before a battle the player optionally goes into the \\"Battle Preparation\\" menu (accessible at any time) and chooses up to three sets of seven commands for each character in the party. This set of twenty one commands is called a \\"Command Setup\\" and several of these setups can be saved for switching between classes. Commands can also be linked in order to create combos. These can then be used in battle. The player controls one of the characters while the others are controlled by the AI. Players can freely change the character they are controlling. The main character can transform into the White Knight using action chips which are acquired by defeating enemies. \\"Boss battles\\" also take place in a similar fashion except that they may include cut-scenes (videos) for in-battle events. Some enemies are extremely large in size. Enemies can be attacked with various kinds of elemental attack magic, while the player can heal the party by resorting to divine magic. Magic is an essential part of the White Knight Chronicles battle system, but it comes with one pitfall‚ÄîMagic skills do not improve a character's physical strength. This means magic users have to avoid enemy attacks. Among the featured weapons are swords, two handed longswords, two handed axes, spears, bows and staffs. After defeating an enemy, players will obtain materials. Materials are used for crafting and upgrading armor, weapons, accessories and item, as well build Georama parts. Georama The Georama system is an online mode that lets the player create their own town. It can function as a lobby and allows the player to set up shops and harvest spots. People can enter this virtual town and also take a look around. The editing mode functions as a system that can be placed from a list of objects ranging from houses and other garden accessories to anything customizable for the town. Towns can be placed in the middle of plains, deserts, or wilderness with six different field types. Other items can also help to shape the hub including elevated platforms, embankments, trees, and other items. The georama system was also in Level-5's Dark Cloud series. Non- player characters (NPCs) can be recruited to towns from locations around the world map. This makes the player's Georama change depending on whoever is living in it. NPCs have jobs and specific skill levels which will affect the kind of materials and items available to use in Georama. Each Geonet has up to 20 rooms for players to join. A maximum of 12 people can visit a room at one time, and up to 4 can take on a quest together. Plot White Knight Chronicles begins in the kingdom of Balandor, where Princess Cisna is having a coming-of-age banquet. Leonard, the main protagonist; his childhood friend, Yulie; and the Avatar (a new employee at Rapacci Wines, where the three work), are tasked with delivering wine for the party. Once the delivery is completed, they decide to stay for the party, which is soon raided by an evil organization called the Magi. In the ensuing commotion, King Valtos, Cisna's father, is killed by a man in dark armor, causing a shocked Cisna to regain her voice (which was \\"lost\\" when her mother, Queen Floraine, was assassinated). Leonard grabs the distraught Cisna's hand and leads her to safety in the castle's lower levels. There, they find a giant suit of armor, an \\"Incorruptus\\"; and a strange gauntlet called the \\"Ark\\". Using the Ark to merge with the armor, Leonard becomes the White Knight, which can the combat the Magi. After eliminating a large monster from the castle, Cisna is kidnapped by the Magi. Sarvain, the royal advisor, tasks Leonard to rescue the Princess with the White Knight; Yulie, the Avatar, and a \\"humble traveler\\" named Eldore join him. The motive behind the kidnapping is Cisna's ability to unlock sealed Knights, of which she is unaware of at first. The leader of Magi is a general called Dregias, the man who killed Valtos. All that is known about him is that he is capable of transforming into the winged Black Knight, Ebonwings. Soundtrack The official White Knight Chronicles soundtrack was released on 2 dics on July 1, 2009 by Aniplex. The music was composed by Takeshi Inoue, Yumiko Hashizume, and Noriyasu Agematsu. Orchestration was done by Hideo Inai, lyrics by Akihiro Hino, and vocals by Kazco Hamano who sung the main theme song, Travelers and ending theme, Shards of Time. The North America release of the game removed the original Japanese voices for Travelers and Shards of Time, replacing them with English-dubbing. Manga A web exclusive prequel manga called Shirokishi Monogatari: Episode 0 Dogma Senki (White Knight Chronicles Episode 0: Dogma War Chronicleis) was released in 2008. Takashi Ikeda oversaw the story for this prequel with Y≈´ko Sat≈ç illustrating the actual manga in collaboration with Media Factory's Comic Alive editorial department. The story takes place 10,000 years before the main game's story in an era embroiled by war and chaos. It follows the story of another White Knight who predates the White Knight hero character of the game. Reception White Knight Chronicles received mixed reviews, with an aggregated score of 64/100 on Metacritic. Famitsu gave the game a 29/40, with the reviewers highlighting the online mode as being the source of their main gripes. Despite the lukewarm reviews the game sold well; around 130,000 copies on its first day and around 207,000 in its first week in Japan. Eurogamer gave the game an 8/10, criticizing the multiplayer, with the caveat that \\"disappointing multiplayer doesn't take away from how enjoyable the game is, or how well- thought-through and impressively integrated its gameplay systems are.\\" The game has received 3/5 stars from X-Play, a 6/10 rating from GameSpot, and a 5.1/10 rating from IGN.

Academic Press 2002 Stated mathematically: :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{D}\\\\Gamma}{\\\\mathrm{D}t} = 0 where \\\\Gamma is the circulation around a material contour C(t). Stated more simply this theorem says that if one observes a closed contour at one instant, and follows the contour over time (by following the motion of all of its fluid elements), the circulation over the two locations of this contour are equal. This theorem does not hold in cases with viscous stresses, nonconservative body forces (for example a coriolis force) or non-barotropic pressure-density relations. Mathematical proof The circulation \\\\Gamma around a closed material contour C(t) is defined by: :\\\\Gamma(t) = \\\\oint_C \\\\boldsymbol{u} \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\boldsymbol{s} where u is the velocity vector, and ds is an element along the closed contour. The governing equation for an inviscid fluid with a conservative body force is :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{D} \\\\boldsymbol{u}}{\\\\mathrm{D} t} = - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho}\\\\boldsymbol{ abla}p + \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\Phi where D/Dt is the convective derivative, œÅ is the fluid density, p is the pressure and Œ¶ is the potential for the body force. These are the Euler equations with a body force. The condition of barotropicity implies that the density is a function only of the pressure, i.e. \\\\rho=\\\\rho(p). Taking the convective derivative of circulation gives : \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{D}\\\\Gamma}{\\\\mathrm{D} t} = \\\\oint_C \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{D} \\\\boldsymbol{u}}{\\\\mathrm{D}t} \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\boldsymbol{s} + \\\\oint_C \\\\boldsymbol{u} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{D} \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\boldsymbol{s}}{\\\\mathrm{D}t}. For the first term, we substitute from the governing equation, and then apply Stokes' theorem, thus: : \\\\oint_C \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{D} \\\\boldsymbol{u}}{\\\\mathrm{D}t} \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\boldsymbol{s} = \\\\int_A \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\times \\\\left( -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho} \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} p + \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\Phi \\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{n} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}S = \\\\int_A \\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho^2} \\\\left( \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\rho \\\\times \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} p \\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{n} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}S = 0. The final equality arises since \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\rho \\\\times \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} p=0 owing to barotropicity. We have also made use of the fact that the curl of any gradient is necessarily 0, or \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\times \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} f=0 for any function f. For the second term, we note that evolution of the material line element is given by :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{D} \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\boldsymbol{s}}{\\\\mathrm{D}t} = \\\\left( \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\boldsymbol{s} \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\right) \\\\boldsymbol{u}. Hence :\\\\oint_C \\\\boldsymbol{u} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{D} \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\boldsymbol{s}}{\\\\mathrm{D}t} = \\\\oint_C \\\\boldsymbol{u} \\\\cdot \\\\left( \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\boldsymbol{s} \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\right) \\\\boldsymbol{u} = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\oint_C \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\left( |\\\\boldsymbol{u}|^2 \\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\boldsymbol{s} = 0. The last equality is obtained by applying Stokes theorem. Since both terms are zero, we obtain the result :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{D}\\\\Gamma}{\\\\mathrm{D}t} = 0.  Poincar√©‚ÄìBjerknes circulation theorem  A similar principle which conserves a quantity can be obtained for the rotating frame also, known as the Poincar√©‚ÄìBjerknes theorem, named after Henri Poincar√© and Vilhelm Bjerknes, who derived the invariant in 1893Poincar√©, H.

Career Falkenborg graduated from Redmond High School. He was 6-2 with a 0.75 ERA and 75 strikeouts as a senior at Redmond. He was selected by the Baltimore Orioles in the second round of the MLB Draft and signed with the Orioles on July 6, 1996. Falkenborg pitching for the Las Vegas 51s, Triple-A affiliates of the Los Angeles Dodgers, in He began his professional career with the GCL Orioles in the Rookie level Gulf Coast League in 1996. He also pitched in one game for the Single-A High Desert Mavericks that season. Falkenborg Spent most of with the Single-A Delmarva Shorebirds, with the High-A Frederick Keys and with the Double-A Bowie Baysox. He made his major league debut for the Orioles on October 1, 1999, pitching two scoreless innings of relief against the Boston Red Sox. He underwent Tommy John surgery in the off-season and missed the entire season. Falkenborg was signed as a free agent by the Seattle Mariners and spent the season with the Mariners minor league affiliates at San Antonio and Tacoma. He stayed with Tacoma through the season, despite battling an assortment of injuries that led to him spending significant time on the disabled list. Falkenborg signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers for the season, but spent most of the year with the Triple-A Las Vegas 51s, appearing in only six major league games for the Dodgers, working 14.1 innings and finishing with a 7.53 ERA. He did record his first major league victory on May 9, 2004, in a 14 inning game against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He spent the season with the San Diego Padres organization, appearing in 10 games for the Padres, and finishing with an 8.18 ERA. The bulk of his season was spent with the Triple-A Portland Beavers. Falkenborg pitched in 21 games for the St. Louis Cardinals between and , though again spending most of those seasons in the minors with the Memphis Redbirds. He was released by the Cardinals on November 20, 2007, and on December 12, 2007, signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Dodgers. He failed to make the Dodgers roster out of spring training and was assigned to the Las Vegas 51s, eventually joining the Dodgers major league roster on June 25. He was designated for assignment on August 8. He was claimed off outright waivers by the San Diego Padres on August 13. SoftBank Hawks In November 2008, Falkenborg signed with the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks of Nippon Professional Baseball. Used as a set-up man with the Hawks in his first season, Falkenborg performed well above expectations in the 2009 season. He did not allow one earned run in spring training and that streak extended until the last week of May. Teaming with rookie set-up man Tadashi Settsu and closer Takahiro Mahara, the tall righty finished second in the Pacific League in holds behind Settsu. The trio was nicknamed \\"SBM\\", (short for Settsu, Brian, Mahara), and Falkenborg was named to the Pacific League All-Star Team. Falkenborg ran into some trouble late in the season as he came down with elbow tightness in August. He was taken off the active roster twice, once for the injury, and again in late September to shut him down for the season as he was having trouble recovering for the injury. He had also been taken off the active roster earlier in the season due to the birth of his second child. Still, Falkenborg finished with a 6-0 record, one save, and a 1.74 ERA to go with 61 strikeouts in 51 and 2/3 innings. He was even better in the 2010 regular season. Used as the 8th inning reliever behind Settsu, Falkenborg gave up one run in his 5th appearance of the season against the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles on April 3. From there, he began a streak of 19 straight appearances without giving up an earned run, a streak that ended on May 29 against the Chunichi Dragons. After that, he went two months without giving up an earned run before melting down in two consecutive appearances against the Saitama Seibu Lions and Orix Buffaloes. Still, Falkenborg finished with a record of 3-2 with one save and a 1.02 ERA. However, he was not as good in the playoffs, as he gave up five earned runs in just two innings of work for a 22.50 ERA. Despite this, he was signed to a 2-year contract extension by the Hawks. Falkenborg rebounded from the bad postseason to have another great season in a Hawks uniform. With regular closer Mahara missing most of the season due to the death of his mother, mechanical problems and injury, Falkenborg took on the role of closer. He was 1-2 with a 1.42 ERA in 47 and 1/3 innings (50 appearances), and he also recorded 19 saves, tied for the club lead with Mahara, who returned at the end of the season. The big American also vanquished his playoff demons as he pitched in six total playoff games, giving up one run in seven and 1/3 innings, with two walks and 11 strikeouts. He made five appearances in the 2011 Japan Series against the Chunichi Dragons, giving up no runs and striking out 10.

Its southern terminus is at the Mason‚ÄìDixon Line near Stewartstown, where PA 24 continues into Maryland as Maryland Route 23 (MD 23). The northern terminus is at PA 921 in Mount Wolf. The route heads north from the state line through rural areas in southern York County, intersecting PA 851 in Stewartstown and PA 216 in Winterstown. PA 24 continues north to Red Lion, where it crosses PA 74 and intersects the south end of PA 624. The route runs through suburban areas to the east of York, crossing PA 124, PA 462, and U.S. Route 30 (US 30). PA 24 continues north through rural land and reaches its end in Mount Wolf. PA 24 was designated in 1928 to run from the Maryland border south of Stewartstown north to US 111 (Old York Road) in New Market. The route ran north to Red Lion, where it followed PA 74 northwest to York before running north along US 111 to North York and continuing north to York Haven, west to Lewisberry, and north to New Market. In the 1950s, the north end of PA 24 was cut back to Interstate 83 (I-83)/US 111 southwest of New Market. In York, the route was split into one- way pairs in the downtown area while US 111 Alternate (US 111 Alt.) ran concurrent with PA 24 between York and I-83/US 111 in North York. In the 1960s, PA 24 was rerouted to head north from Red Lion to US 30 (now PA 462) and PA 250 east of York. The former alignment became PA 74 by itself between Red Lion and York, I-83 Business (I-83 Bus.) between York and I-83 in North York, PA 181 between PA 250 (now US 30) in North York and York Haven, PA 382 between York Haven and PA 114 near Bunches, and an extended PA 114 between Bunches and New Market. PA 24 was extended north to PA 921 in Mount Wolf in the 1970s, replacing the easternmost portion of PA 250. Route description PA 24 northbound past its southern terminus at MD 23 at the Maryland border in Hopewell Township PA 24 begins at the Maryland border in Hopewell Township, where the road continues into Maryland as MD 23. From the state line, the route heads to the northwest on two-lane undivided Barrens Road South and passes through agricultural areas with scattered residences. PA 24 enters the borough of Stewartstown and becomes Main Street, heading north past homes. In the center of the borough, the route forms a short concurrency with PA 851. The road passes more residences and a few businesses before leaving Stewartstown for Hopewell Township again, becoming Barrens Road North. PA 24 continues through more open farmland with occasional patches of woods and homes. Upon passing through the community of Rinely, the route crosses into North Hopewell Township and continues northwest through more rural areas on Winterstown Road. PA 24 enters the borough of Winterstown and becomes Main Street, passing a few homes as it intersects PA 216. After this intersection, the road passes more farmland and heads back into North Hopewell Township, with the road name changing back to Winterstown Road. The route heads through more farm areas with some houses, curving to the northeast as it becomes the border between York Township to the west and Windsor Township to the east. The road passes homes as it continues into the borough of Red Lion, where it turns north onto Main Street. PA 24 is lined with more residences as it heads northwest through Red Lion and intersects PA 74 in the center of town. Past this intersection, the route continues past a mix of homes and businesses in the downtown area, coming to the PA 624 junction. The road passes more residences before leaving Red Lion and becoming the York Township-Windsor Township border again, with the road name becoming Cape Horn Road. PA 24 passes a mix of suburban homes and businesses, running through East Yoe. The route turns more to the north as it continues through a mix of farmland and residential development. The road makes a turn northwest into suburban neighborhoods and turns north again as it comes to an intersection with PA 124 in a commercial area. Past PA 124, PA 24 continues north on Edgewood Road and enters Springettsbury Township, passing wooded residential neighborhoods. The route widens into a four-lane divided highway as it reaches the PA 462 junction. From here, the road becomes Mount Zion Road and passes homes before running near industrial establishments, coming to a bridge over an East Penn Railroad line. After an interchange with US 30, PA 24 enters commercial areas and passes to the east of the York Galleria shopping mall. Past the mall, the route narrows back into a two-lane undivided road and heads northwest through a mix of wooded residential areas and some fields, passing through Mount Zion. PA 24 makes a turn north onto an unnamed road and crosses the Codorus Creek into Manchester Township, passing a mix of residential neighborhoods and farmland. The route passes through Starview and turns to the northwest, heading into the borough of Mount Wolf. Here, PA 24 becomes Center Street and passes homes before turning southwest onto Main Street and ending at the eastern terminus of PA 921 a short distance later. History When routes were first legislated in Pennsylvania in 1911, what would become PA 24 was designated as part of Legislative Route 216 between Red Lion and York and as part of Legislative Route 250 between York and New Cumberland. PA 24 was designated in 1928 to run from the Maryland border south of Stewartstown north to US 111 (Old York Road) in New Market. The route followed its current alignment to Red Lion before it ran northwest concurrent with PA 74 to York. From York, PA 24 ran north through Manchester to York Haven, where it turned west and passed through Newberrytown and Lewisberry before it curved north and continued to its terminus. Upon designation, the entire length of PA 24 was paved. In York, PA 24 entered the city from the southeast with PA 74 on Queen Street before it turned west to follow US 30 on Market Street and north to follow US 111 on George Street. The unnumbered road between Red Lion and Mount Wolf was paved in the 1930s. In the 1950s, the northern terminus of PA 24 was cut back to an interchange with I-83/US 111 southwest of New Market. In addition, US 30/PA 24/PA 74 was moved onto the one-way pair of Market Street eastbound and Philadelphia Street westbound in York while US 111 Alt. was designated concurrent with PA 24 on George Street between US 30/PA 74 in downtown York and I-83/US 111 in North York, replacing US 111 which was realigned to follow I-83. US 111 Alt./PA 24 was routed onto the one-way pair of Duke Street northbound and George Street southbound south of North Street. In 1961, PA 24 was realigned at Red Lion to head north to US 30 (now PA 462) east of York, where PA 250 continued north before turning west onto a northern bypass of York (now US 30). The former alignment of PA 24 north of Red Lion became solely PA 74 between Red Lion and York, I-83 Bus. (which replaced US 111 Alt.) between York and I-83 in North York, PA 181 between PA 250 (now US 30) in North York and York Haven, PA 382 between York Haven and PA 114 near Bunches, and an eastern extension of PA 114 between Bunches and New Market. This change was made as part of the construction of I-83 in order to provide a numbered route at each interchange. In the 1970s, PA 24 was extended north to the eastern terminus of PA 921 in Mount Wolf, replacing the section of PA 250 between present-day PA 462 and US 30. In addition, the route was widened to a divided highway in the vicinity of the PA 462 intersection.

Looney Tunes short directed by Robert McKimson. The short was released on June 29, 1946, and stars Bugs Bunny and Nero the Lion. This was the first cartoon McKimson directed that starred Bugs Bunny. Plot synopsis Bugs Bunny meets Nero in Acrobatty Bunny, animated by Richard Bickenbach. A circus is being set up just above Bugs' rabbit hole, causing much noise and vibration. The lion cage is set up directly above the hole, and the lion takes deep sniffs (alternatively yanking Bugs towards the hole or throwing him back) to determine that the animal below is Bugs. When the lion (whom Bugs eventually refers to as \\"Nero\\") roars again, Bugs comes to the surface to see what's going on, riding an elevator that makes twists and turns. Bugs tries to reason with the lion, but soon makes a hasty escape when Nero takes a swipe at him. Nero manages to get out of his cage, and chases Bugs around the circus grounds. Bugs at one point ducks into a dressing room, coming out as a clown trying to convince Nero to laugh, which he eventually does ‚Äî until Bugs takes some whacks at the lion with a wooden board. The lion then chases Bugs into the big top, where they swing around acrobat swings. Eventually, Bugs tricks Nero into a cannon and sets the cannon off, causing Nero to do a hula in his 'skirt', plays the ukulele.

The direct image functor is the primary operation on sheaves, with the simplest definition. The inverse image exhibits some relatively subtle features. Definition Suppose we are given a sheaf \\\\mathcal{G} on Y and that we want to transport \\\\mathcal{G} to X using a continuous map f\\\\colon X\\\\to Y. We will call the result the inverse image or pullback sheaf f^{-1}\\\\mathcal{G}. If we try to imitate the direct image by setting :f^{-1}\\\\mathcal{G}(U) = \\\\mathcal{G}(f(U)) for each open set U of X, we immediately run into a problem: f(U) is not necessarily open. The best we could do is to approximate it by open sets, and even then we will get a presheaf and not a sheaf. Consequently, we define f^{-1}\\\\mathcal{G} to be the sheaf associated to the presheaf: :U \\\\mapsto \\\\varinjlim_{V\\\\supseteq f(U)}\\\\mathcal{G}(V). (Here U is an open subset of X and the colimit runs over all open subsets V of Y containing f(U).) For example, if f is just the inclusion of a point y of Y, then f^{-1}(\\\\mathcal{F}) is just the stalk of \\\\mathcal{F} at this point. The restriction maps, as well as the functoriality of the inverse image follows from the universal property of direct limits. When dealing with morphisms f\\\\colon X\\\\to Y of locally ringed spaces, for example schemes in algebraic geometry, one often works with sheaves of \\\\mathcal{O}_Y-modules, where \\\\mathcal{O}_Y is the structure sheaf of Y. Then the functor f^{-1} is inappropriate, because in general it does not even give sheaves of \\\\mathcal{O}_X-modules. In order to remedy this, one defines in this situation for a sheaf of \\\\mathcal O_Y-modules \\\\mathcal G its inverse image by :f^*\\\\mathcal G := f^{-1}\\\\mathcal{G} \\\\otimes_{f^{-1}\\\\mathcal{O}_Y} \\\\mathcal{O}_X.  Properties  * While f^{-1} is more complicated to define than f_{\\\\ast}, the stalks are easier to compute: given a point x \\\\in X, one has (f^{-1}\\\\mathcal{G})_x \\\\cong \\\\mathcal{G}_{f(x)}. * f^{-1} is an exact functor, as can be seen by the above calculation of the stalks. * f^* is (in general) only right exact. If f^* is exact, f is called flat. * f^{-1} is the left adjoint of the direct image functor f_{\\\\ast}. This implies that there are natural unit and counit morphisms \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\rightarrow f_*f^{-1}\\\\mathcal{G} and f^{-1}f_*\\\\mathcal{F} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathcal{F}. These morphisms yield a natural adjunction correspondence: :\\\\mathrm{Hom}_{\\\\mathbf {Sh}(X)}(f^{-1} \\\\mathcal G, \\\\mathcal F ) = \\\\mathrm{Hom}_{\\\\mathbf {Sh}(Y)}(\\\\mathcal G, f_*\\\\mathcal F). However, the morphisms \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\rightarrow f_*f^{-1}\\\\mathcal{G} and f^{-1}f_*\\\\mathcal{F} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathcal{F} are almost never isomorphisms. For example, if i\\\\colon Z \\\\to Y denotes the inclusion of a closed subset, the stalk of i_* i^{-1} \\\\mathcal G at a point y \\\\in Y is canonically isomorphic to \\\\mathcal G_y if y is in Z and 0 otherwise. A similar adjunction holds for the case of sheaves of modules, replacing i^{-1} by i^*. References * . See section II.4.

The town was located on the Double Mountain Fork Brazos River, 14 miles northwest of Hamlin in southern Stonewall County, Texas, United States. History The town was founded in 1876. Its original establishment was meant to capitalize on the buffalo trade and it was Stonewall County's first settlement. In 1877, the town housed a store, two saloons, a dance hall, and a few tents and dugouts. The town's namesake was Charles Rath, whose store, built in 1875, was the structure around which the village grew. A declining buffalo population ended the settlement and it was abandoned in 1880.Rath City, Texas: Handbook of Texas Online, University of Texas at Austin Rath City and Native Americans In February 1877, after buffalo hunter Marshall Sewell was killed by Native Americans, Rath City became a rallying point for over 500 frontiersmen. A group of 46 men left Rath City in pursuit of a Comanche war party led by Black Horse, in a campaign known as the Buffalo Hunters' War or Staked Plains War. The men pursued the Comanche to a site in present-day Lubbock. A battle ensued on March 18, 1877, at Yellow House Canyon; its results were inconclusive.

Karapetyan (; born May 19, 1953) is a retired Armenian finswimmer, best known for saving the lives of 20 people in a 1976 incident in Yerevan. Biography Karapetyan was born on May 19, 1953 in Armenia's third largest city of Kirovakan (now called Vanadzor), then part of the Soviet Union. His family moved to Yerevan in 1964, where Shavarsh finished eight years of school and then attended a technical school for auto- mechanics. By the advice of family friends, he started to learn swimming at a young age. He later switched to finswimming. In 1975-1976, Karapetyan served in a Soviet Air Defence Forces base in the Baku military district. 1976 trolleybus incident Karapetyan is a Merited Master of Sports of the USSR and a ten-time World Record-breaker in finswimming. He became well known in the former USSR for his heroic actions of saving peoples' lives. On September 16, 1976 while jogging alongside Yerevan Lake with his brother Kamo, also a finswimmer, Karapetyan had just completed his usual distance of when he heard the sound of a crash and saw a sinking trolleybus which had gone out of control and fallen from a dam wall. The trolleybus lay at the bottom of the reservoir some 25 metres (80 ft) offshore at a depth of 10 metres (33 ft).Soviet Champion Saves 20 Lives, 1976 . Yahoo Voices. Retrieved 19 July 2013 Karapetyan swam to it and, despite conditions of almost zero visibility, due to the silt rising from the bottom, broke the back window with his legs. The trolleybus was crowded, it carried 92 passengers, Karapetyan started bringing people to the top, where his brother would get them. The combined effect of cold water and the multiple lacerations from glass shards led to Karapetyan's hospitalization for 45 days, as he developed pneumonia and sepsis. Subsequent lung complications prevented Karapetyan from continuing his sports career. Karapetyan's achievement was not immediately recognized. All related photos were kept at the district attorney‚Äôs office and were only published two years later. He was awarded the Medal \\"For the Salvation of the Drowning\\" and the Order of the Badge of Honor. His name became a household name in the USSR on October 12, 1982, when Komsomolskaya Pravda published the article on his feat, entitled \\"The Underwater Battle of the Champion\\". This publication revealed that he was the rescuer; and he received about 60,000 letters. On February 19, 1985, Shavarsh just happened to be near a burning building that had people trapped inside. He rushed in and started pulling people out without a second thought. Once again, he was badly hurt (severe burns) and spent a long time in the hospital.

Programs in this field have contributed both to the health of dogs and to the public health. In countries where routine rabies vaccination of dogs is practiced, for example, rabies in humans is reduced to a very rare event. Currently, there are geographically defined core vaccines and individually chosen non-core vaccine recommendations for dogs. A number of controversies surrounding adverse reactions to vaccines have resulted in authoritative bodies revising their guidelines as to the type, frequency, and methods/locations for dog vaccination. Recommended administration of vaccines In 2010 and 2011, revised guidelines addressed concerns about adverse vaccine reactions by altering the recommended frequency, type, methods, and locations for administration of core and non-core canine vaccines. General schedule Most vaccination protocols recommend a series of vaccines for puppies, with vaccine boosters given at one year of age. Frequency of vaccination thereafter varies depending on the lifestyle of the individual dog, including: * indoor vs. outdoor * travel plans * kennel/boarding plans * underlying disease conditions * other exposure risks * the disease and vaccine type Because these factors may change over time, many professional organizations recommend routine annual examinations, where a vaccination plan for each individual canine can be decided during a discussion between the veterinarian and dog owner. Type In their 2010 recommendations, WSAVA (World Small Animal Veterinary Association) emphasized the importance of administering non-adjuvanted vaccines whenever possible, as vaccines that included these immune-stimulating agents were shown to increase adverse vaccine reactions in pets. Frequency WSAVA also prefers serological testing over unnecessary boosters or re-vaccination doses of core vaccines after the initial 12-month booster that follows the puppy series of modified live virus [MLV] vaccines. This is because core vaccines show an excellent correlation between the presence of antibody and protective immunity to a disease, and have a long DOI (Duration of Immunity). Antibody tests can be used to demonstrate the DOI after vaccination with core vaccines, though not for non-core vaccines (such as parainfluenza). Method Most vaccines are given by subcutaneous (under the skin) or intramuscular (into the muscle) injection. Respiratory tract disease vaccination may be given intra-nasally (in the nose) in some cases. Location Many recent protocols indicate that vaccines should be given in specific areas in order to ease identification of which vaccine caused an adverse reaction and ease removal of any vaccine-associated sarcoma. Although these protocols were initially designed for cats, some similar protocols are likely to be developed for canines, as well. In North America, veterinarians adopted the practice of injecting specific limbs as far from the trunk of the body as possible, for example the rear right limb for rabies. This set of locations was not widely adopted outside of North America, and the international Vaccination Guidelines Group (VGG) made new recommendations that vaccines be administered: * in subcutaneous (and not intramuscular) sites * in the skin of the lateral thorax or abdomen (for easier excision of any FISS that occur) * so as to avoid the interscapular or intercostal regions (as more extensive surgical resection would be needed for sarcomas) * in a different site on each occasion (either with general locations per species per year or diagrams of where administered on specific visit) Core vaccines Dog vaccination against canine distemper Core vaccines are defined as those vaccines which ALL dogs, regardless of circumstances, should receive. Core vaccines protect animals from severe, life-threatening diseases which have global distribution. Rabies The 2011 North American recommendation includes rabies in the core vaccines. Likewise, the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians (NASPHV) in the U.S. gives detailed instructions on how to deal with what they describe as a serious public health problem, and includes a useful table, summarizing all the rabies vaccines sold in the U.S. The 2010 international VGG recommendation generally considers the rabies vaccine a non- core vaccine, except in areas where the disease is endemic or where required by law. CDV/CAV-2/CPV-2 In many locations the rabies vaccine is accompanied by a single combined vaccine shot which protects against: * CDV (canine distemper), * CAV-2 (canine hepatitis virus or adenovirus-2) and * CPV-2 (canine parvovirus). This combination vaccine may also be known as DHPP or DAPP. Non-Core vaccines Non-core vaccines are those that are required by only those animals whose geographical location, local environment or lifestyle places them at risk of contracting specific infections. * Except in areas where the disease is endemic or where required by law, the VGG considers the rabies vaccine as non-core. * Both of the most recent vaccine protocols no longer consider canine parainfluenza to be a core vaccine and have moved CPiV into the non-core category. * For dogs expected to board, be shown, or to enter a kennel situation within 6 months, vets may recommend administering Bordetella, which protects again a respiratory illness commonly known as \\"kennel cough\\" in addition to canine parainfluenza virus (another kennel cough agent). * Vaccination against Lyme disease, an illness that is spread via deer ticks, is also indicated in certain environments where deer ticks frequently occur. Lyme disease is known to cause lethargy, fever, soreness, and in cases gone untreated, damage to joints, paralysis, and nerve damage. * For dogs living in/visiting rural areas or areas frequented by wildlife, another important vaccine is to consider is against Leptospirosis, a disease characterized by weakness, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, and kidney and liver failure. Leptospirosis comes from standing water containing urine from animals infected with leptospira, and the disease can be transmitted to humans via contaminated water or food. Not recommended vaccines Generally not recommended, owing to unproven efficacy, are: * canine coronavirus, * canine adenovirus-1 (which also causes significant reaction), * Giardia vaccine and * rattlesnake envenomation vaccine. Controversy Vaccination has become a controversial topic among veterinarians and dog owners. Specific adverse reactions and general consequences for long-term health and immunity are both being cited as reasons to reduce the frequency of pet vaccination. The 2010 vaccination guidelines published by the WSAVA (World Small Animal Veterinary Association) reduce the number of vaccines which should be considered core for canines, as well as recommending less frequent vaccine administration. In the executive summary section, the WSAVA guidelines do argue against needless vaccination and in support of \\"the development and use of simple in-practice tests for determination of seroconversion (antibody) following vaccination.\\" They also note that \\"Vaccines should not be given needlessly. Core vaccines should not be given any more frequently than every three years after the 12 month booster injection following the puppy/kitten series, because the duration of immunity (DOI) is many years and may be up to the lifetime of the pet.\\" The open letter critique focuses on the less-nuanced summary of these recommendations in the tables given for vaccination guidelines, which could imply that re-vaccination should occur every three years. Adverse reactions Vets and owners should also consider factors that have been shown to increase the risk of adverse vaccine reactions. Examples of such factors include: * age, * number of vaccinations per office visit, * size, * type or ingredients of vaccine itself, * breed, * neutered status, * general health of the dog, and * past vaccination history.

There are 2000 entries and 1000 photographs, with the CD-ROM having 250 sound items and 40 videos. A map showing all of the Aboriginal groups, \\"based on language, history, self-identification, culture, [and] technology\\" as in the Encyclopaedia, was created by Horton in 1996 (and later updated). Description The Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history, society and culture was first published in two volumes, containing 1340 pages of entries and illustrations, in 1994. According to Horton, The Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia was \\"the first significant authoritative and comprehensive reference on all aspects of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history, society and culture\\". It covers all major subject categories, including history, art, economy, food, health, land ownership, language, law, literature, and music, as well as more recent political issues and biographies. Note: Includes downloadable PDF of the Introduction. Over 200 contributors wrote articles for the Encyclopaedia, many of them Indigenous writers, activists or scholars. The editor chose to mention white people in the Encyclopaedia only where they had some impact on Aboriginal society.Read, Peter. For the record. In: Australian book review. No. 165, Oct 1994, p. 29-30. There about 2000 entries and about 1000 photographs, maps and drawings. Two main themes are attributed to every article: Geographic Region and General subject. Prominent Aboriginal Australians Charles Perkins, David Mowaljarlai, and Galarrwuy Yunupingu all wrote endorsements to be printed on the cover of the book. The work is aimed at a wide audience, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, and it is written for general as well as academic readers. Most entries are followed by suggestions for further reading, with each work fully cited in the bibliography. Maps The map, published separately in 1996 (and with further editions in 1999, 2000, 2008 and 2013) delineates about 500 groups, divided into 18 geographic regions. Horton created the original map \\"by laying a large piece of transparent paper over the top of a large Tindale map\\" and then searching for further information from various published works, theses and work by linguists. The result of his researches led to the creation of the distinctive \\"fuzzy borders\\" of his map, which mostly corresponded with Tindale's boundaries. His original hand-drawn version is dated 1993. This version, which he called the \\"mud map\\" was used as a basis for the maps in the printed encyclopaedia. The Australian Surveying and Land Information Group (AUSLIG), a precursor to Geoscience Australia, produced the 1996 version. Reviews A 1996 review by an Indigenous reviewer called it a \\"Dreaming Send\\", praising the work for representing the Indigenous perspective and for recognising both the diversity as well as the unity among Indigenous Australians. She writes also that it allows white Australians to find information they may not otherwise find, while using a \\"very concise and easy to absorb style\\". Archaeologist Sharon Wellfare said that the \\"much admired\\" work was an \\"invaluable resource\\", which she had used extensively in teaching Aboriginal Studies in New South Wales public schools. She did have some criticisms, notably that the context in which each entry was written relied on self- identification by the author, which was not always evident, as biographies of authors are not supplied. The CD-ROM was made available after the launch of the book version in 1994. It was criticised for user-unfriendliness due to the lack of hypertext links. Important details, such as the passing of the Native Title Act 1993, were missing from the CD-ROM as of 1995.

Antinori was regarded as the first boss of the Tampa crime family, later known as the Trafficante crime family. Although much of his early life is unknown, Antinori was one of the first mobsters to emerge in Florida during the Prohibition era. By the 1930s, Antinori was one of the largest heroin traffickers in the country, with close ties to French-Corsican heroin traffickers and American mafia bosses. Antinori established a drug pipeline from Marseille, France through Cuba into Tampa, Florida. According to the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, the drugs were subsequently distributed in the Midwestern United States, primarily through St. Louis mobster Thomas Buffa and Kansas City mobsters Nicola Impastato, James DeSimone and Joseph Deluca. Law enforcement soon began to concentrate on Antinori's operation. In addition, mobsters such as Florida mobster Santo Trafficante, Sr. soon set up rival smuggling rings. Antinori was eventually eclipsed by Trafficante, who held his own strong connections to Mangano crime family boss Vincent Mangano and Profaci crime family boss Joseph Profaci in New York. On October 23, 1940, Ignacio Antinori was sipping coffee at the Palm Garden Inn in Tampa with a friend and a young female companion. Suddenly, a gunman appeared and fired two shotgun blasts at Antinori, blowing off the back of his head. The gunman was allegedly sent by one of Antinori's dissatisfied customers, the Chicago Outfit criminal organization. Antinori had sent the Outfit a poor quality shipment of narcotics. When the Outfit complained, Antinori refused a refund. At that point, the Outfit put a murder contract on Antinori.  References   Bibliography  #Sifakis, Carl The Mafia Encyclopedia.

Its source is Flagstaff Lake, where its two main tributaries, South Branch Dead River and North Branch Dead River, join (). It flows generally east to join the Kennebec River at The Forks, Maine. The Dead River played a role in the American Revolution. In the fall of 1775 then newly commissioned Colonel Benedict Arnold led a force of over 1000 men on a grueling trip through Maine, as part of the invasion of Canada. Ascending the Kennebec in bateaux, they avoided the rapids of the lower Dead River via a portage of about at the \\"Great Carrying Place\\" (Carrying Place‚ÄìCarrying Place Town, Maine Townships 1‚Äì2, Range 3, BKP WKR) to a position above Long Falls (now drowned in Flagstaff Lake). They proceeded up the North Branch of the Dead River, through the Chain of Ponds to Arnold Pond in Coburn Gore (T.2/3 R.6 WBKP), and across the height of land into the watershed of Quebec's Chaudi√®re River. The logging industry is prominent in the area. Flagstaff Lake was formed by Long Falls Dam in 1950, to regulate the flow of the Dead River into the Kennebec River. At the time, the river drive was still a primary means of delivering timber to the pulp mills downstream. Although improved highways and the trucking industry have replaced the river drive, water releases continue to serve hydroelectric power- generating plants downstream.

The whitewater releases are controlled from Flagstaff Lake, which has been dammed and made into a reservoir, and range from 1200 to 7000 ft¬≥/s (35‚Äì200 m¬≥/s) and range in difficulty from easy class 2 to class 4+. The length of the run is from the put-in at Spencer Stream to the take-out at West Forks with no easy access by road. Boaters must be prepared for at least 5 hours of paddling of varying difficulty. There are 8 whitewater releases every rafting season with 7,000+cfs releases in the spring, 3500cfs in the summer and 6000cfs in the fall. The Northern Forest Canoe Trail (NFCT) is a marked canoeing route extending from Old Forge, New York, to Fort Kent, Maine. From a four-mile portage between Wrangler on Wrangler Lake and Dallas Plantation on the South Branch, the trail runs about down the Dead River, to the mouth of Spencer Stream below Grand Falls.

The goals of phase 1 rehabilitation are: control post-operative pain, reduce inflammation, provide passive motion in a specific plane of movement, and protect the healing repair or tissue. CPM is carried out by a CPM device, which constantly moves the joint through a controlled range of motion; the exact range is dependent upon the joint, but in most cases the range of motion is increased over time. CPM is used following various types of reconstructive joint surgery such as knee replacement and ACL reconstruction. Its mechanisms of action for aiding joint recovery are dependent upon what surgery is performed. One mechanism is the movement of synovial fluid to allow for better diffusion of nutrients into damaged cartilage, and diffusion of other materials out; such as blood and metabolic waste products. Another mechanism is the prevention of fibrous scar tissue formation in the joint, which tends to decrease the range of motion for a joint. The concept was created by Robert B. Salter M.D in 1970 and, along with help from engineer John Saringer, a device was created in 1978. CPM Following Knee Arthroplasty For people who have had total knee replacement without complications, continuous passive motion has been shown to provide clinically relevant benefits. CPM does improve long-term function, long-term knee flexion, knee extension in the short or long term. In unusual cases where the person has problems which prevent standard mobilization treatment, then CPM may be useful. Although studies in the past have shown a benefit of the use of CPM in those individuals having undergone a TKA, recent research has shown that the benefits are questionable. When groups that only received standard mobilization therapies were compared to groups that received CPM treatment in addition to this same therapy, the results suggest that there is no significant increase in functional outcomes or length of hospital stay, or a decrease in adverse affects related to the surgery. These results weren‚Äôt adequate for supporting the use of CPM over potentially more successful interventions, such as active exercise that is both high in intensity and velocity. Given the lack of support in current literature, the use of CPM over other treatment is not advised for most patients having undergone a TKA, nor is its use recommended as a standard procedure in clinical practice. Patient compliance is key to rehabilitation. Furthermore, with patients attempting at- home therapies, must follow orders with proper form CPM Following Strokes There are limited occupational therapies that are fully supported across a spectrum of patients. The fundamental movements provided by the CPM units, potentially allows for a remedial and fast progressing therapy. This is according to the University of California. This is an untapped potential for stroke patients that needs to be further explored, according to the same source. CPM units are a rare form of therapy that directly correlates the amount of use to the amount of progress. It is easy to neglect at-home therapeutic exercises for various reasons, but CPMs can be used while watching television or doing anything stationary. This ability to multi-task therapy with recreational activities hold higher promise for patients completing the therapy at home. Completing the therapy at home is just as important as prescribing it. That is why some studies suggest physical and occupational therapy yield better results than CPM units. CPM units should be used supplementary; also, these studies have fully compliant PT and OT patients whereas most patients do not fulfill their at-home exercises as often or with proper form that is suggested in these studies.

The designation begins at PA 136 near West Newton and ends at US 30 near Bedford. Route description A dirt PA 31 near Jones Mills, Westmoreland County. Westmoreland and Fayette counties PA 31's designation begins at Pennsylvania Route 136 near West Newton. It travels east, interchanging with Interstate 70. After that interchange, PA 31 does not intersect any more numbered roads until it interchanges with U.S. Route 119 in the western part of Mount Pleasant. When PA 31 interchanges US 119, it turns from a two-lane surface road into first a four-lane road, and then into a city street as it goes through Mount Pleasant. As PA 31 progresses through Mount Pleasant, it forms a concurrency with Pennsylvania Route 981. After that, it intersects Pennsylvania Route 819 before leaving the borough and entering the township. The first intersection with a numbered road after entering the township is Pennsylvania Route 982. This is the only major intersection until it reaches Donegal. When it does reach Donegal, there is an entrance ramp to the Pennsylvania Turnpike, and immediately following that is the western terminus of the concurrency with Pennsylvania Route 711. later, PA 31 intersects Pennsylvania Route 381. This marks the eastern terminus of the concurrency with PA 711, and the western terminus of PA 381. It is also the northern terminus of the PA 381/711 concurrency as well. Before leaving Donegal Township, PA 31 approaches the eastern terminus of the concurrency with PA 381. This is the last major intersection before PA 31 winds its way through rural Pennsylvania to Somerset. Somerset County A view of southbound PA 281 at the western terminus of the concurrency. Just after crossing the Westmoreland County/Somerset County line (the dividing line between the Pittsburgh metropolitan area and the Johnstown, Pennsylvania metro area, PA 31 provides entrance to the Hidden Valley Ski Resort area.

Immediately after entering Somerset, PA 31 intersects Pennsylvania Route 281 and forms a concurrency on one-way pairs. While being concurrent, both highways intersect the southern terminus of Pennsylvania Route 601. Not a long while after, PA 31/281 end the concurrency, as PA 281 splits north, while PA 31 continues east. A view of the eastern terminus of the concurrency. Past the downtown area, PA 31 weaves through the Pennsylvania Turnpike and passes over U.S. Route 219. PA 31 continues toward Roxbury, running along the border between Stonycreek Township and Brothersvalley Township. The intersection with Pennsylvania Route 160 is the last intersection in Somerset County and the only one in Roxbury. After this intersection, PA 31 generally parallels the Turnpike and winds through hilly terrain, passing through Allegheny Township on its way east. Bedford County Entering Bedford County, there are no major intersections with any numbered roads until PA 31 enters Manns Choice. Instead, it winds through hilly terrain that parallels the Turnpike. As PA 31 nears Manns Choice, it intersects Pennsylvania Route 96 and is concurrent for . After separating, PA 31 continues for before terminating at U.S. Route 30. History As early as 1772, a road called Glades Road had originally led from Somerset to Bedford, which were the places of two underground railroad stations. The road would become PA 31 and would go through the towns of West Newton, Mount Pleasant, Monongahela, and Washington that had also organized underground railroad stations. Sproul Road Bill In 1911, the Sproul Road Bill defined Legislative Route 181 for the segment between Washington and West Newton, LR 186 between West Newton and Somerset, LR 364 between Somerset and Dividing Ridge, and LR 49 between Dividing Ridge and Bedford. 1927-1940 The PA 31 designation began appearing on road maps and signage in 1927. At that time, the western terminus was at the West Virginia line at West Virginia Route 27. The east end back then was still at US 30, unchanged from today. On its way eastward, PA 31 met the southern terminus of PA 28 near Avella, was concurrent with PA 18 and US 19, and traded paths with US 40 in Washington. Major change In September 1964, the western terminus of PA 31 was truncated to its current location at the intersection of Mount Pleasant Road and Greensburg Pike in West Newton. Two segments of the decommissioned route were renumbered. PA 136 was designated from the western terminus of PA 31 to US 40/PA 18 in Washington. PA 844 (Jefferson Avenue) was designated from PA 18 (Henderson Avenue) to the PA/WV state line. This left a gap of 1.4 miles of the former PA 31 which ran concurrently with PA 18 (and very briefly with US 40) between the termini of the newly designated routes (PA 844 east, PA 136 west). As a result, this gap did not need renumbered or any additional designations. Major intersections Attractions Glades Pike Inn The Glades Pike Inn is a notable inn situated on the Glades Pike section of PA 31 in Somerset. Since 1842, the inn was a place for weary travelers to unhitch their horses for a good place to eat and sleep. The modern day visitors of the inn use it for different reasons of traveling. The inn is located in the Laurel Mountains recreational area. Glades Pike Winery The Glades Pike Winery is situated on the section of PA 31 known as Glades Pike, between Somerset and Donegal.

Borrowers who get title loans must allow a lender to place a lien on their car title, and temporarily surrender the hard copy of their vehicle title, in exchange for a loan amount. When the loan is repaid, the lien is removed and the car title is returned to its owner. If the borrower defaults on their payments then the lender is liable to repossess the vehicle and sell it to repay the borrowers‚Äô outstanding debt. These loans are typically short-term, and tend to carry higher interest rates than other sources of credit. Lenders typically do not check the credit history of borrowers for these loans and only consider the value and condition of the vehicle that is being used to secure it. Despite the secured nature of the loan, lenders argue that the comparatively high rates of interest that they charge are necessary. As evidence for this, they point to the increased risk of default on a type of loan that is used almost exclusively by borrowers who are already experiencing financial difficulties. Most title loans can be acquired in 15 minutes or less on loan amounts as little as $100. Most other financial institutions will not loan under $1,000 to someone without any credit as they deem these not profitable and too risky. In addition to verifying the borrower's collateral, many lenders verify that the borrower is employed or has some source of regular income. The lenders do not generally consider the borrower's credit score. History Title loans first emerged in the early 1990s and opened a new market to individuals with poor credit and have grown increasingly popular, according to studies by the Center for Responsible Lending and Consumer Federation of America. They are the cousin of unsecured loans, such as payday loans. Since borrowers use their car titles to secure the loans, there‚Äôs risk that the borrower can lose their vehicle by defaulting on their payments due to personal circumstances or high interest rates, which almost always have APR in the triple digits‚Äîwhat are sometimes called ‚Äúballoon payments‚Äù. Alternative title lending exist in many states known as car title pawn or auto pawn as they are called. Similar to a traditional car title loan, a car title pawn uses both the car title and the physical vehicle (which is usually stored by the lender) to secure the loan much like any secured loan works, and there are the same risk and factors involved for the borrower but in most cases they will receive more cash in the transaction since the lender has both the vehicle and title in their possession. Process A borrower will seek the services of a lender either online or at a store location. In order to secure the loan the borrower will need to have certain forms of identification such as a valid government-issued ID like a driver‚Äôs license, proof of income, some form of mail to prove residency, car registration, a lien-free car title in their name, references, and car insurance, though not all states require lenders to show proof of auto insurance. The maximum amount of the loan is determined by the collateral. Typical lenders will offer up to half of the car's resale value, though some will go higher. Most lenders use Kelley Blue Book to find the resale value of vehicles.The History of Kelley Blue Book. Retrieved on 2016-04-16. The borrower must hold clear title to the car; this means that the car must be paid in full with no liens or current financing. Most lenders will also require the borrower to have full insurance on the vehicle. Depending on the state where the lender is located, interest rates may range from 36% to well over 100%. Payment schedules vary but at the very least the borrower has to pay the interest due at each due date. At the end of the term of the loan, the full outstanding amount may be due in a single payment. If the borrower is unable to repay the loan at this time, then they can roll the balance over, and take out a new title loan. Government regulation often limits the total number of times that a borrower can roll the loan over, so that they do not remain perpetually in debt. If the borrower cannot pay back the loan or is late with his or her payments, the title loan lender may seek to take possession of the car and sell it to offset what is owed. Typically lenders choose this option as a last resort because it may take months to recover the vehicle, and repossession, auction, and court costs all decrease the amount of money they are able to recoup. During this time, the lender is not collecting payments yet the vehicle is depreciating. Most states require the title loan lender to hold the vehicle for 30 days to allow the borrower to recover it by paying the balance. Typically, any amount from the sale over the existing loan balance is returned to the defaulter. Today, the internet has revolutionized how companies can reach their clientele, and many title loan companies offer online applications for pre-approval or approval on title loans. These applications require much of the same information and still may require a borrower to visit a store to pick up their money, usually in the form of a check. When filling out these applications, they may ask for things like the vehicle's Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) and/or insurance policy numbers. Loan calculation The amount a borrower can be loaned is dependent on the worth of their vehicle. A lender will typically look up the auction value of the car being used as collateral and offer a loan that‚Äôs between 30% and 50% of the worth of the vehicle. This leaves lenders a cushion to make profit if ever they need to repossess the vehicle and sell it at auction, in the event the borrower defaults. States offering title loans Title loans are not offered in all states. Some states have made them illegal because they are considered a welfare-reducing provision of credit, or predatory lending. Other states, like Montana, have begun placing strict regulations on title loans by not allowing the APR to reach above 36%, down from the previous 400%. However, Montana has recently voted against allowing title loans in the state. In 2008, New Hampshire passed a law capping APR at 36%. Some companies claim their average loan amounts to be between $300 and $500, and had to shut down their store fronts in that state, or their business entirely, because their business could not survive on a low APR for low loan amounts. Since then, the law has been reversed and new growth in the title loan industry has emerged, allowing title loan lenders to charge 25% interest a month, or roughly 300% APR. States continue to vote on legislation allowing or disallowing title loans. Some states have no limit on the APR that title loan companies can charge, while others continue to crack down and push for stricter regulation. Early in 2012, Illinois recently voted to cap APR on title loans at 36%, with other provisions that would limit the title loan industry in the state. The vote did not pass, but voters and politicians in Illinois and other states continue in their convictions to regulate or outlaw title loans. The California State Assembly passed a law in 2020 that set an interest rate cap on all loans from $2,500-$10,000 with that title loans was included. In 2020 California State Assembly set a minimum amount on all auto title loans at $2,500. Demographic of small-dollar-credit consumers Small-dollar-credit (SDC) refers to services offered by payday and title loan industries. In 2012, a study was conducted by the Center for Financial Services Innovation. According to the study, SDC consumers are generally less educated, have more children, and are based in the South, where there is a greater concentration of unbanked or underbanked people. In addition, there‚Äôs a healthy spread of SDC consumers with a range of salaries‚Äîshowing 20% of SDC consumers have a household income between $50,000 and $75,000. However, 45% of respondents to the survey would classify themselves as ‚Äúpoor‚Äù. Controversy In a BBC article, a spokesman for a company offering short-term loans says that APR is not a valid model when assessing costs associated with short-term subprime loans, and that the charges are appropriate for the convenience of quickly obtaining a short-term loan. Instead, the APR model is better for assessing costs associated with a middle- or long-term loan options. The high interest rates on title loans are justified by defenders of the industry, stating that the higher interest rates are necessary for the lending companies to turn profit. The borrowers are considered \\"high risk\\" and may default on their debt. Therefore, the higher interest rates are a means of securing profit even if the borrower defaults, and ensures the company sees a positive rate of return. Criticism Critics of title loans contend that the business model seeks and traps impoverished individuals with ridiculous interest rates by lenders who aren‚Äôt entirely transparent regarding the payments. This practice lends confusion and so some borrowers are unaware of the situation that getting a small-dollar-credit loan puts them in. However, they are already locked in the loan and have no means of escaping other than paying the loan off or losing their vehicle. The practice has been compared to loan sharking, because the interest rates are so high. Even though states are placing stringent restrictions on things like interest rates that can be charged, regulating the practices of companies offering short-term loans, like payday loans or title loans, proves to be a difficult endeavor. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission, both federal regulatory agencies responsible for enforcing federal law with non-banking institutions, admit that they do not have the authority to enforce the Military Lending Act, which states that military members and their families can pay an APR no higher than 36%, while banning loans to service members that would be secured through their banking accounts, vehicles, or paychecks. Some lenders can move around the Military Lending Act's restrictions by offering open-ended credit loans instead of title loans or payday loans. This allows them to continue charging triple-digit APR on their loans. Some groups, such as the Texas Fair Lending Alliance, present title loans and payday loans as a form of entrapment, where taking out one of these means that borrowers will find themselves cycling further into debt with less chances of getting out of debt when compared to not taking the loan out at all, contending that 75% of payday loans are taken out within two weeks of the previous loan in order to fill the gap in finances from when the loan was originally taken out. In 2001, Texas passed a law capping interest rates on title loans and payday loans. However, lenders are getting around the restrictions by exploiting loopholes allowing them to lend for the same purposes, with high-interest rates, disguised as loan brokers or as a Credit Services Organization (CSO). The Vice President of state policy at the Center for Responsible Lending in Durham, North Carolina argues that the car title loan model is built around loans that are impossible to repay. He goes on to cite a 2007 study by the Center for Responsible Lending which shows that 20% of title loan borrowers in Chicago had taken out a loan in order to repay a previous loan to the same lender. Evidence from The Pew Charitable Trusts cite a need for consumers to be better informed. The Pew report states that of the more than 2 million consumers who obtain title loans, one out of nine consumers default on their loans, and notes that repossession affects approximately 5 to 9 percent of borrowers who default.

The southern terminus of the route is at the Delaware state line in Kennett Township, where it continues as Delaware Route 41 (DE 41). The northern terminus is at U.S. Route 30 (US 30) in Gap. PA 41 runs along a two- lane undivided road called Gap Newport Pike, passing through mostly rural areas of Chester and Lancaster counties and serving Avondale, Chatham, Cochranville, and Atglen. The route serves as the main road linking Wilmington, Delaware to Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The Gap and Newport Turnpike was charted in 1807 to run from Gap southeast to the Delaware border, where it was to continue to Newport, Delaware. PA 41 was first designated in 1926 to run between US 22/PA 3/PA 13 in Harrisburg and US 22/PA 3 and US 120/PA 13 in Reading, following US 230 between Harrisburg and Lancaster and US 222 between Lancaster and Reading. PA 41 was rerouted at Lancaster to run southeast to the Delaware border in 1928, heading south from Lancaster to Lampeter along US 222/PA 72 before it turned east to Gap and southeast along the Gap Newport Pike. The western terminus was cut back to US 222 in Lampeter by 1930 while PA 741 was designated from PA 41 north to US 30 in Gap. PA 41 was rerouted to US 30 by 1940 while PA 741 was designated on the former alignment between US 222 in Lampeter and Gap. Route description PA 41 northbound past the US 1 interchange in London Grove Township PA 41 begins at the Delaware border in Kennett Township, Chester County, where the road continues into that state as DE 41 and heads towards the city of Wilmington. From the state line, the route heads northwest on two-lane undivided Gap Newport Pike, passing through farmland with some development. The road enters New Garden Township and comes to an interchange with Limestone Road, which heads south to the Delaware border and becomes DE 7. PA 41 continues northwest through more rural areas with some homes and businesses, crossing Newark Road and passing a weigh station on the southbound side that serves trucks from both directions. Then route heads into the borough of Avondale, where it crosses an East Penn Railroad line at-grade and comes to an intersection with Baltimore Pike. Here, the road becomes Pennsylvania Avenue and runs through wooded residential areas. PA 41 leaves Avondale for London Grove Township and becomes Gap Newport Pike again, passing near homes and farmland before Baltimore Pike heads to the west. The route continues through commercial areas before coming to an interchange with the US 1 freeway. Following this, the road runs through agricultural areas with some woods and homes, reaching an intersection with PA 841 in the community of Chatham. PA 41 continues through more rural areas and enters Londonderry Township, where it comes to a junction with PA 926. A short distance later, the road reaches a junction with the northern terminus of PA 796. The route runs through more farmland with some woodland and residences, crossing into West Fallowfield Township. Here, PA 41 comes to the community of Cochranville, where it crosses PA 10. After Cochranville, the road heads through more open farmland with some patches of woods and homes. The route climbs a hill, gaining a second northbound lane for trucks, before narrowing back to two lanes and passing to the west of Octorara High School. PA 41 descends a hill, with a second southbound truck lane, before it becomes a two- lane road again. The route briefly passes through a corner of West Sadsbury Township before it enters the borough of Atglen and comes to an intersection with PA 372. Following this, PA 41 heads into wooded areas and comes to a bridge over Amtrak's Keystone Corridor and Swan Road. The road curves northwest and crosses back into West Sadsbury Township, passing through a mix of farm fields and development. The route heads down a hill, with an additional southbound truck lane, before it returns to two lanes. PA 41 southbound at northern terminus at US 30 in GapPA 41 crosses Pine Creek into Sadsbury Township in Lancaster County. At this point, the route enters the Pennsylvania Dutch Country of eastern Lancaster County, which is home to many Amish farms. The roadway heads west past homes and businesses as it bypasses the borough of Christiana to the north, briefly gaining a center left-turn lane. The road curves to the north-northwest and passes through a mix of farms and woods with some commercial development a short distance to the east of the Amtrak line, becoming a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane. The route heads north and crosses into Salisbury Township, where it enters the residential community of Gap and gains a second southbound travel lane. In Gap, the road comes to an intersection with the eastern terminus of PA 741. PA 41 heads into business areas and comes to its northern terminus at a junction with US 30 (Lincoln Highway), which provides access to the city of Lancaster to the west. PA 41 serves as part of the main route connecting Wilmington to Lancaster and sees heavy truck traffic. Because the route is two lanes wide and carries high levels of local and through traffic, it experiences a high accident rate. Portions of PA 41 prone to aggressive driving have white dots painted along the travel lanes in order to reduce tailgating by telling motorists to keep a minimum of two dots from the vehicle in front of them. In 2015, PA 41 had an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 14,000 vehicles between the Delaware border and US 1 and between PA 796 and PA 10 to a low of 9,100 vehicles between PA 926 and PA 796. The entire length of PA 41 is part of the National Highway System. History On April 7, 1807, the state of Pennsylvania chartered the Gap and Newport Turnpike to run from the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike in Gap southeast towards Delaware, where it was to continue to the Christina River in Newport, Delaware. The continuation into Delaware was chartered on January 30, 1808. Construction of the Gap and Newport Turnpike began in 1809 and was completed in 1818. The turnpike was created to improve trade between Lancaster County and Wilmington, Delaware. When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, the Gap Newport Pike along with the road running from Gap west to Lancaster were designated as Legislative Route 215. PA 41 was first designated in 1926 to run from US 22/PA 3/PA 13 in Harrisburg to US 22/PA 3 and US 120/PA 13 in Reading, heading southeast through Middletown, Elizabethtown, and Mount Joy to Lancaster, where it turned northeast and passed through Ephrata on its way to Reading. PA 41 ran concurrent with US 230 between Harrisburg and Lancaster and US 222 between Lancaster and Reading. In 1928, PA 41 was rerouted at Lancaster to head southeast to the Delaware border near Kaolin. The new alignment ran along US 222/PA 72 from Lancaster south and east to Lampeter, where PA 41 headed east through Strasburg to Gap. From Gap, PA 41 ran southeast along the Gap Newport Pike to the Delaware border. At this time, all of PA 41 was paved except for the portion between Strasburg and Gap. PA 240 replaced the PA 41 designation along the US 222 concurrency between Lancaster and Reading. By 1930, the western terminus of PA 41 was cut back to US 222 near Lampeter, removing the concurrences with US 230 and US 222, while the road from PA 41 in Gap north to US 30 was designated as PA 741. By this time, the route was paved from a point east of Strasburg east to Gap. The northern terminus of PA 41 was moved to its current location at US 30 by 1940, replacing PA 741. Meanwhile, PA 741 was designated onto the former alignment of PA 41 between US 222 near Lampeter and Gap. In 1954, PA 41 was rerouted to bypass Atglen and Christiana to the northeast along its current alignment, having previously followed Fallowfield Road, Main Street, Zion Hill Road, and Newport Avenue. By 1959, PA 41 was realigned to the east of Cochranville, having previously passed through the community on Cochran Street. Because PA 41 has a high accident rate due to being two lanes wide and carrying a high amount of local and through traffic, plans were made to improve the road. A highway-needs study by planning officials in Chester County in 1986 said the route was \\"deficient\\" and needed to be improved. In 1993, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) began the process of planning improvements to the road to enhance safety and the movement of freight. Three options were presented in improving PA 41: building a bypass of Avondale, building a bypass of Chatham, and widening the route to four lanes between the Delaware border and PA 926. The widening and bypass plans drew the opposition of Governor Ed Rendell and an activist group called Safety Agricultures Village and Environment in 2003, both of whom instead supported a truck ban and traffic-calming measures such as roundabouts along the road. In 2003, PennDOT painted white dots in the travel lanes along portions of PA 41 prone to aggressive driving in order to reduce tailgating along with adding rumble strips. In September 2017, a project began to construct gateways at both the north and south ends of the village of Chatham which would consist of a short median in order to alert traffic they are entering the village. Widening of the road at the gateways was completed in fall 2017, with construction of the medians to take place in spring 2018. There are also plans to improve safety and traffic flow at the route's intersections with PA 841 and PA 926; these projects are currently in the planning stages.

Delegates from each congregation meet in convention every three years to elect the district president, vice presidents, circuit counselors, a board of directors, and other officers. The Rev. Roger Schlechte has been the district president since September 2018. The oldest congregation in the District, Hope Lutheran Church of Westcliffe, Colorado was founded in 1872. Its present building was built in 1917 and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1978. Presidents *Rev. Otto Luessenhop, 1921‚Äì30 *Rev. Otto K. Hensel, 1930‚Äì34 *Rev.

History From approximately 1830 to 1903, the section between Lewisburg and Mifflinburg was owned and operated by the Lewisburg and Mifflinburg Turnpike Company. The section west of Mifflinburg (formerly Youngmanstown) was built by the Bellefonte, Aaronsburg and Youngmanstown Turnpike Company, chartered in 1825. When Pennsylvania's \\"traffic routes\\" were established in 1925, PA 45 was originally signed from Herndon to Easton. The 1928 revision expanded this route westward; PA 45 was signed on two different sections, the connection between them being signed as part of US 120 (later US 122, now PA 405, PA 147, and PA 61). The \\"middle\\" section was signed from Water Street to Montandon, between Milton and Northumberland, and the east section from Ashland to Easton. In 1928, the route was under construction from Indianland to Beersville and completed the following year on the Ashland to Easton section. In 1930, the route was paved from Lehigh Gap to Indianland on the eastern section. In 1934, the eastern terminus was moved from Walnut Street to 13th Street in Easton. In 1932, a western section of PA 45 was opened from Belsano to US 22 near Sankertown and Cresson. The route replaced US 422 from Belsano to Ebensburg and US 22 from Ebensburg to Cresson when those designations were placed on a straighter route. In 1936, the eastern terminus of the middle section was moved from Montandon to Mausdale. In 1946, the eastern terminus of the western section was truncated from Cresson to Ebensburg. Until 1952, the middle section entered Mooresburg on a different route. In 1951, construction began on a bypass which opened in 1952. In 1955, the eastern terminus in the eastern section was moved from 13th Street to Third Street in Easton. Until 1961, there was a break between Mausdale and Ashland, that was connected when PA 54 was truncated to Mausdale. This resulted in PA 45 being a continuous route between Altoona and Easton. This change was undertaken as part of a plan to simplify route numbers across the state. Also in 1961, the western section of PA 45 was decommissioned; the piece of PA 45 between Belsano and Nanty Glo became part of an extension of PA 933 and is currently part of PA 271. In 1962, the route was changed from going into State College via US 322 and then PA 26, to go straight from PA 26 to Boalsburg. On May 9, 1966, the eastern terminus of PA 45 was cut back from Easton to its current location at PA 642 in Mooresburg. The former alignment east of Mooresburg became PA 642 between Mooresburg and Mausdale, an extended PA 54 between Mausdale and Nesquehoning, solely US 209 between Nesquehoning and Weissport, and newly-designated PA 248 between Weissport and Easton. This change was made to remove several concurrencies, while the extension of PA 54 to replace PA 45 between Mausdale and Nesquehoning was made to provide a direct connection with I-80. Major intersections Special routes PA 45 Truck (Mifflinburg) Pennsylvania Route 45 Truck is a truck route in Mifflinburg, Union County. Narrow streets within the borough are avoided by this designation, and a complicated intersection with Pennsylvania Route 304, which does not contain turning lanes, is bypassed. The route begins at PA 304 south of Mifflinburg by heading west along SR 3004 (Red Ridge Road) before turning north onto Pennsylvania Route 104 and ending at PA 45. The truck route is signed as Pennsylvania Route 304 Truck in the opposite direction. PA 45 Truck (Huntingdon County) At mile 2.4, just south of Spruce Creek, a very old overpass, constructed from blocks of stone, carries Norfolk Southern's Pittsburgh Line over PA 45. Passage of large trucks is impossible as it allows only 8'2\\" of clearance, and the speed limit on the associated hairpin turn is 10 mph. Pennsylvania Route 45 Truck is a truck route designed to avoid this bottleneck, other sharp turns, and steep grades along mainline PA 45 in western Huntingdon County. The route is somewhat antiquated, concurrent entirely with other routes, and significantly longer than the twisty mainline. Traveling mostly in Franklin Township and Warriors Mark Township, the route begins in the west by branching northbound along Pennsylvania Route 453, before continuing east along Pennsylvania Route 550, and traveling south along Pennsylvania Route 350 to meet up with its parent. PA 45 Truck (Centre County) Pennsylvania Route 45 Truck is a truck route of PA 45 that bypasses a weight-restricted bridge over Pine Creek on which trucks over 33 tons and combination loads over 40 tons are prohibited. The route follows PA 144, PA 192, and PA 445. It was signed in 2013.

Like its predecessor, the picture was made by MGM starring Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon, but it was filmed on location in England. The film was directed by H.C. Potter and produced by Sidney Franklin, from a screenplay by George Froeschel and Ronald Millar based on characters created by Jan Struther. The music score was by Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa and Herbert Stothart, with additional music by Daniele Amfitheatrof (from Mrs. Miniver) (uncredited) and the cinematography by Joseph Ruttenberg. Greer Garson (Kay), Walter Pidgeon (Clem), Reginald Owen (Mr. Foley) and Henry Wilcoxon (Vicar) played their original roles. Also in the cast were Peter Finch (Polish officer) and James Fox in his first film appearance (Toby Miniver). Plot Walter Pidgeon and Greer Garson The story, told partly in flashback and narrated by Clem Miniver, commences on VE Day as Clem and Judy return home from war service and Toby returns from a foster family in America. Judy, a corporal driver, is loved by Tom Foley, a captain in the Royal Engineers, but she is besotted with a general (Leo Genn) married but separated and twice her age. Kay Miniver has also conducted a brief but platonic affair with an American colonel. Clem is now restless and dissatisfied; he successfully applies for a design contract in Brazil. But Kay, unknown to him, has developed a major cardiac condition and has one year at most to live. Despite this, she persuades the general to return to his wife, leaving Judy free to marry Tom. The wedding goes ahead. Clem decides to stay in London and brings Tom into his architectural practice, and soon after he's made aware of his wife's illness. Satisfied that her family are safe and happy, Kay dies. No mention is made of the eldest Miniver son, Vincent, who appeared in the earlier film, possibly because Greer Garson and Richard Ney (the actor who portrayed Vincent) had married and been divorced (1943‚Äì1947) by the time The Miniver Story was produced in 1950.

(1984). Cyranoids. In Milgram (Ed), The individual in a social world. New York: McGraw-Hill The cyranoid concept originated in the late 1970s with psychologist Stanley Milgram, who developed the idea as a means of operationalizing the mind‚Äìbody fusion fantasy explored in Edmond Rostand's 1897 play Cyrano de Bergerac.Blass, T. (2004). The Man Who Shocked the World: The Life and Legacy of Stanley Milgram. New York: Basic Books In the story, Cyrano (a romantic but unattractive poet) supplies Christian (a handsome but inarticulate cadet) with amorous prose so that they may jointly woo Roxane (each being incapable, given their respective limitations, of doing so on their own). Milgram differentiated the various components of a cyranic interaction: The \\"shadower\\" receives words supplied by a \\"source\\" by-way-of covert audio relay (e.g., discreet radio transmission) and immediately replicates these words using an audio-vocal technique known as speech shadowing. The \\"interactant\\", meanwhile, dialogues face-to-face with the shadower. If successful, the nature of the interaction gives rise to a phenomenon Milgram referred to as the \\"cyranic illusion\\", whereby the interactant fails to detect that their interlocutor is merely a speech shadower repeating the words of a remote source. In his original pilot studies, Milgram explored a variety of cyranic interactions, including a scenario in which panels of teachers interviewed who they believed were autonomously-communicating 11- and 12-year-old children, when in reality Milgram, acting as a source, provided the children with what to say. None of the teachers suspected their interviewees were in fact being controlled by another individual despite the highly sophisticated responses they seemingly produced. Another scenario included multiple sources controlling a single shadower. Following these studies, Milgram concluded that the cyranoid method held promise as a social psychological research tool, as it allows one to separate the form of a social actor (their physical nature) from the content (words) they produce in interactive social settings. Among other things, therefore, the cyranoid method serves as a means of exploring phenomena such as racial, gender, and age-based stereotyping, as one can dynamically test how a single source is perceived and interacted with differently on the basis of their communicating through a variety of physically-differentiated source- types. Though initially ignored, researchers have recently begun re-exploring the cyranoid concept in scientific settings. In 2014, Kevin Corti and Alex Gillespie, social psychologists at the London School of Economics, published the first replications of Milgram's original pilots (Milgram himself never formally published his work with the technique).Miller, G. (2014, September). If Someone Secretly Controlled What you Say, Would Anyone Notice? WIREDNeuroskeptic. (2014, September). Cyranoids: Stanley Milgram's Creepiest Experiment. Discover Robb Mitchell has explored cyranoids as an experiential learning tool within the classroom (having children shadow for teachers during teaching exercises).Mitchell, R. (2010). Teaching Via Human Avatar: Enlivening Delivery Through Students Acting as Proxies for Remote Lecturers . Paper presented at SOLSTICE 2010, Lancashire, United Kingdom. Cyranoids have also been used in installation art to explore social experiences whereby people encounter those familiar to them through the bodies of strangers.Mitchell, R., Gillespie, A., & O‚ÄôNeill, B. (2011). Cyranic Contraptions: Using Personality Surrogates to Explore Ontologically and Socially Dynamic Contexts. Paper presented at DESIRE‚Äô11, Eindhoven, Netherlands. More recently the cyranoid method has been extended to study how humans interact with artificial agents such as chat bots. A speech shadower who speaks the words of an artificial agent is called an echoborg. When people interact with a covert echoborg they tend to engage in more intersubjective effort. The cyranoid and echoborg methods can be used to mix and match bodies and cognition sources opening up a broad range of research questions.

History On July 15, 1960, PA 50 was designated to replace the stretch of PA 28 between the West Virginia border and Pittsburgh. This designation change was made to reduce the number of concurrent routes in Pittsburgh. The changes took effect a few months later and signs were changed by spring 1961.

His most popular singles were \\"We Belong Together\\" and \\"It's Almost Tomorrow\\".  History  Tennant was born in Jacksonville, Florida, where he became involved in music entertainment. It was there he met Elvis Presley and they became lifelong close friends. After Elvis' death, Tennant operated an Elvis memorabilia museum in Memphis for about twenty years. In the early 1960s, he worked as the manager for a singer from Texas named James Mullins, who used the name Jimmy Velvit. The two soon split due to disagreements. Tennant, who had recorded under his own name in the late 1950s, began using Jimmy Velvet as his show name by early 1963. Mullins continued recording separately using the Velvit spelling, and is still recording to this day. In fact, they both separately made recordings of \\"We Belong Together\\" during that period. When Tennant first recorded and released \\"We Belong Together in April, 1963, his intent was to be billed as Jimmy Velvet. But when the initial records were made, a copy of the earlier Mullins release on Cub was used as an informational reference, and his name was given as \\"Velvit\\". The label was also named as such, as the intent was to sell the record with the name association for the label. Only 1,000 copies were made, and most were destroyed. In July, more copies were made with the label name changed to the intended VELVET spelling, but Jimmy's name still showed as Velvit. Of the two singers, only Tennant's \\"We Belong Together\\" and \\"It's Almost Tomorrow\\" reached the Top 100 charts. A later album titled Reflections of...Jimmy Velvet's Greatest Hits did contain both those charted songs, and may still be found today. Velvet toured in 1973-1978 with the Jimmy Velvet Show band. Band members included Steve Morgan (guitar), John Collins (bassist), Dennis Moog (drums), and Kathy Slinkard Velvet (stage name Kathy Scott, married to Jimmy from 1970-1997)(keyboards) Velvet was championed by TV host Dick Clark, who had him on his American Bandstand show more than once. Clark helped him release a 1967 album A Touch of Velvet. The LP contained some of Jimmy's single releases including the title song and \\"It's Almost Tomorrow\\", but not \\"We Belong Together\\". Jimmy used various labels for his releases, including his own label named Velvet Tone. Velvet is still involved with the music field, and has published an autobiography titled Inside the Dream (2007), which includes a wealth of celebrity photographs from the early days of rock and roll.

The college was established by the Northwest Conference of the Methodist Church. History John Day donated of land to the school, located in Belle Plain. In its beginnings local citizens donated generously to the institution. During its first year of existence, 1881‚Äì82, it operated in conjunction with the Belle Plain public school system. Franklin Wesley Chatfield served as Belle Plain College (BPC) president during most of its inaugural year. In the spring of 1882 the state awarded BPC a charter and Rev. J.T.L. Annis served as president of the college for the next two years. During his tenure enrollment increased to 122. Other presidents of BPC include: John W. McIllhenny (1884‚Äì85), C. M. Virdel (1885-87), and I.M. Onins (1887‚Äì92).Belle Plain College: Handbook of Texas Online, University of Texas at Austin. Curriculum and campus From its inception the college boasted of its music program. By the end of the 1880s the school had fifteen pianos, a brass band, and an orchestra. Though the campus comprised two buildings by 1885 the entire school had been mortgaged to pay for classroom furnishings and instruments. The school's only funding came from the local school district, a fact which hastened its demise. Upon founding, the school had a girl's dormitory constructed. At the college's height over 300 people were enrolled and in 1885 a three-story stone structure was built at the site. BPC had a military branch of its school in the small town of Belle Plain. The students there were required to wear blue and gray uniforms.Plaque at site of Belle Plain College The end of Belle Plain College When the railroad skipped over Belle Plain in favor of Baird the latter quickly gained favor and became the county seat of Callahan County in 1883. The population began to decline as a result. A couple years of bad weather depleted the college's already empty coffers. Judge I.M. Onins took over the school and its debts in 1887. The mortgage company foreclosed on the property in 1889, though they allowed it to operate until Onins' 1892 death. Today the ruins of the college buildings remain.

The 23rd New Jersey Infantry Regiment was recruited from various towns within Burlington County, New Jersey, and was mustered into Federal service in August 1862. The regiment trained at Camp Cadwalader in Beverly, before being sent out to join the Army of the Potomac. There, it was brigaded with the New Jersey units that made up the famed \\"First New Jersey Brigade\\", which had been reduced to a shadow of its former self due to continual field service and participation in the Battles of Gaines Mill, Second Bull Run, and South Mountain. The arrival of the nearly 1,000-strong 23rd New Jersey and the newly recruited three-year 15th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry greatly replenished the brigade's numbers. When the 23rd New Jersey's first commander, Colonel John S. Cox, resigned to prevent a court-martial for drunkenness in November 1862, the new commander, Col. Henry O. Ryerson (the former Lieutenant Colonel of the 2nd New Jersey Volunteer Infantry), reviewed the regiment, and disparagingly called them \\"Yahoos\\", due to their less than military demeanor and irreverence. The men of the regiment took to the sobriquet, emblazoning it on their regimental flag, and called themselves Yahoos for the rest of their lives. The regiment fought in two engagements-the December 1862 Battle of Fredericksburg, and the May 1863 Battle of Salem Church. Years after the war was over, the regiment erected a monument--the only one ever erected for a nine-month New Jersey unit--on the Salem Church battlefield, where it stands today. In that engagement, it was led by Col. Edward Burd Grubb, Jr., who took over command when Colonel Ryerson left to lead the 10th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry in March 1863. After serving its nine-month enlistment, the regiment was mustered out in June 1863. Many of the veterans of the 23rd New Jersey went on to serve in other regiments, most notably the 34th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry, which is attributed to the fact that Colonel Grubb, much respected by the Yahoos, was rumored to be the commander of the unit (he in fact went on to command the 37th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry instead). Captain Forrester L.

It is Aarne-Thompson type 671. Origins The tale was collected by the Brothers Grimm from a man named Hans Truffer from Visp. The tale was included in the 1819 edition of their Kinder- und Hausm√§rchen, replacing the earlier Der gestiefelte Kater (\\"The Tomcat with Boots\\").Bolte, Johannes; Pol√≠vka, Jiri.

Synopsis A count's only son could learn nothing. Three times the count sent him for a year to famous masters. Each time, the son came back: saying first that he knew what dogs said when they barked; the next time, what birds said; and finally, what frogs said. Infuriated by his uselessness, his father ordered his people to take him to the woods and kill him, but they sympathised with him, and instead brought the count the eyes and tongue of a deer as proof of his death. John Batten for Joseph Jacobs's Europa's Fairy Book (1916). On his wanderings, he liberated an area from haunting by dogs, by raising a treasure from under a tower, which he could do because he understood their language. The lord of the castle asked him to do so, and he came out with a chest of gold, and the lord adopted him as a son. He went to Rome. In Rome, the Pope had died, and the cardinals wanted him as the Pope's successor, as two doves had sat on his shoulders as a divine sign. On his journey, listening to the frogs had made him sad and thoughtful. He consented to his appointment, as the doves advised him to do. When he had to read Mass, the doves whispered how to do it in his ear. Analysis The tale is classified in the Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as ATU 671, \\"The Three Languages\\". Stith Thompson argues that the tale is sometimes confused with ATU 517, \\"The Boy Who Learned Many Things\\".Thompson, Stith. The Folktale. University of California Press. 1977. p. 84. Joseph Jacobs attempted to reconstruct a protoform of the tale in his Europa's Fairy Book, titled The Language of Animals.Jacobs, Joseph. European Folk and Fairy Tales. New York, London: G. P. Putnam's sons. 1916. pp. 66-71. In his commentaries, the folklorist argues that the story's original format involves a prophecy that the boy would become pope or king.Jacobs, Joseph. European Folk and Fairy Tales. New York, London: G. P. Putnam's sons. 1916. pp. 235-237.\\"De droom van den koningszoon\\". In: Coolen, Antoon. Sprookjes uit alle landen. Met illustraties van Rie Reinderhoff. Den Haag: J. Philip Kruseman. 1941. pp. 9-16. Scholars Johannes Bolte and Jiri Pol√≠vka suggested the ATU 671, ATU 517 (\\"The Boy Who Learned Many Things\\") and ATU 725 (\\"The Prophecy, or, Dream of Future Sovereignty\\") types comprised an original single tale.Bolte, Johannes; Pol√≠vka, Jiri.

D. Nutt. 1888. pp. 161-181. The story falls under the folklore motif of \\"The Outcast Child\\", i.e., the hero or heroine is expelled from home, but later rises through the ranks of society and returns home victorious.Hartland, E. Sidney. \\"The Outcast Child.\\" The Folk-Lore Journal 4, no. 4 (1886): 308-49. http://www.jstor.org/stable/1252856. Cultural references The story is a classic example of the archetypal hero's progress through life. In Lemony Snicket: The Unauthorized Autobiography, there is a rendition of the tale. For the Count's son; learning and education has meaning to the beholder, and in some cases, only to the beholder. In addition, there is an expectation that knowledge is power and can allow the beholder of knowledge to become self- sufficient/self-reliant.

The contrabass bugle (usually shortened to contra or simply called the marching tuba) is the lowest-pitched brass instrument in the drum and bugle corps and marching band hornline. It is essentially the drum corps' counterpart to the marching band's sousaphone: the lowest-pitched member of the hornline, and a replacement for the concert tuba on the marching field. It is different from the other members of the marching band and drum corps hornlines in that it rests on the shoulder of the player, rather than being held in front of the body. Because the contrabass bugle can get in the way of commonly worn headgear, such as a shako, it is not uncommon for contrabass players to wear a beret instead of whatever else the rest of the ensemble is wearing for headgear. This also gives the players some distinction from the rest of the brass ensemble. History The first contrabass bugle was developed in the 1960s by Whaley Royce, a Canadian instrument manufacturer which produced bugles for many drum corps of that era. Matching all other competition bugles at the time, these early contrabass bugles were pitched in the key of G, making them significantly larger than all tubas to that date, save the large E and BB concert tubas used in all brass bands. The contrabass bugle is the only member of the drum corps bugle line that has never been produced in a valve-less style, as it was developed when the drum corps rules allowed one piston valve and one rotary valve. They changed to fit new rules along with the rest of the drum corps hornline, first receiving two vertical (or in this case, slanted for ease of use) piston valves, then 3 and later 4 valves to make the instrument fully chromatic. Equivalent instruments in the key of BB and CC were produced by instrument manufacturers for marching bands who wished to possess the sound of these contrabass bugles, generally regarded as \\"darker\\", without losing hornline sonority by having the basses in a different overtone series from the rest of the hornline (or requiring marching tubists to learn another set of fingerings for tuba parts originally written for BB and CC instruments). In the 2000s, contrabass bugles often have three or four valves, as is common on concert tubas. Like most of their concert counterparts, they are pitched in either C or BB‚ô≠, although within the dwindling number of drum corps still using older instruments, they are, like the rest of the traditional bugle line, pitched in the key of G (or GG, depending on which naming convention is used). Instruments in any of these keys are generally larger in modern times compared to their older counterparts, although improved materials and construction techniques in the manufacture of instruments allows them to be made stronger and lighter than before. Construction and naming With most circuits now permitting B‚ô≠, C, and F instruments, the modern contrabass bugle is essentially a concert tuba converted for ease of marching. Generally, the primary differences between pure concert tubas and contrabass bugles are # On both pure marching and convertible tubas, the concert leadpipe, with the pipe curving around the bell to the valves, is replaced with one that curves forward and back, placing the mouthpiece in an appropriate location for the new playing position, on the left (or occasionally, right) shoulder (which has earned it the nicknames of \\"shoulder rocket\\" and \\"shoulder cannon\\"), rather than in front of the player. On some \\"Marching-Convertible\\" models, this leadpipe can be unscrewed and replaced with a concert model. # All dedicated marching instruments have the valve section rotated into a more comfortable playing position. Some lower-end convertible tubas have the capacity to rotate the valve section between marching and concert configurations. Although historically (see below) drum and bugle corps contras were pitched in G, the construction was nearly identical to modern B‚ô≠ and C instruments, the only differences being the length and diameter of the tubing and (at one time) the valve section. In fact, modern drum corps now use multi-key instruments originally developed several years ago for marching bands who wished to emulate the sound of contemporary (G-instrumented) drum corps hornlines. Movement and visual effects In a drum and bugle corps, the marching style for contrabass bugles are the same as for the rest of the hornline. However, there can be small differences, especially with effects such as ripples of the hornline. Often, instead of snapping the horn up or down or to the side, the players will have their horns bell down on the ground and will snap their hands on top of the horn. The mouth of the large bell of a contrabass bugle can be used to display a colored elastic screen with a logo, as was done by the Madison Scouts in 1985. This usually does not affect the sound significantly, as long as the fabric is lightweight.

Freleng. The short features Bugs Bunny.  Plot 250px The cartoon begins with the voice of an apparent Hollywood gossip queen named \\"Lola Beverly\\" (patterned after newspaper and radio columnist Louella Parsons, infrequently known as \\"Lolly\\"; note the next sentence) talking behind the camera as it pans across Beverly Hills, settling in on Bugs Bunny's \\"mansion\\", which is actually a rabbit hole with fancy trimmings such as columns and a swimming pool. Lola (or \\"Lolly\\" as Bugs calls her familiarly, also effecting her hoity-toity manner of speech) coaxes a biographical story out of Bugs, and he talks about growing up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan (presumably accounting for his accent). He is seen tap-dancing down the streets of the Big Apple and singing \\"The Daughter of Rosie O'Grady\\" (a song written in 1917 by Walter Donaldson and Monty C. Brice). Most of the story involves Bugs being repeatedly assaulted by a \\"street gang\\" consisting of a pack of stray dogs, led by a tough-talking but none-too-bright bulldog who wears a bowler hat and turtleneck sweater (and also resembles Hector, a bulldog which appeared in a number of Sylvester/Tweety cartoons starting in 1948). There are at least two references to real-life New York City landmarks. In one scene, Bugs smacks the bulldog with pieces of pie purchased at the Automat; in another, he tries to escape through the Stork Club (spelled here \\"Stork Klub,\\" wherein real storks are the patrons). Bugs then tries to hide in a rooftop billboard for \\"Egyptian\\" cigarettes, a play on animated billboards in Times Square. At one point, the bulldog finds himself hanging by one \\"hand\\" from a clothesline. Bugs, on an adjacent line, plays Tweety's time-honored \\"this little piddy\\" game (even talking in something close to Tweety's voice), peeling the clumsy canine's \\"piddies\\" from the line one by one. When he \\"runs out of piddies\\" and the dog falls, Bugs reverts to his normal voice, and his regular aside to the audience, \\"Gee, ain't I a stinker?\\" Bugs thinks he has dispatched the dogs, saying \\"that's '-30-' for today!\\" He goes back to his tap-dancing and singing, and suddenly finds himself in a blind alley next to a newsstand. The gang of dogs reappears and marches in on Bugs menacingly. Bugs grabs a book and threatens to hit them with it in his \\"last stand\\". The dogs' eyes open wide when they see the book, and they turn around and race to, and across, the Brooklyn Bridge. The puzzled Bugs looks at the book and sees that it is the then-recent novel, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, which was obviously the inspiration for the cartoon's title. Bugs says to himself and the audience, in a rare quiet and reflective moment, \\"Ya know, maybe I oughta read dis t'ing!\\" As the underscore reprises an instrumental bar of \\"Rosie O'Grady\\", Bugs is seen walking away from the camera and toward the city's skyscrapers, while reading the book and humming along until the animation irises out.  Production notes  An illustration from the Coronet autobiographical short story of the same name.The short was originally based on a short autobiographical piece of the same name that was published in the December issue of Coronet magazine in 1945. In the autobiography, Bugs recounts his rise and only briefly mentions his days on the streets of Manhattan which he describes as \\"simple and carefree\\". He would spend his days throwing rocks at his pals, stealing carrots from local pushcarts, and dealing with thugs using his \\"rabbit punch\\" technique. The story continues in which Bugs reveals that his name was given to him by his family for his funny antics. In time he would land a job at a place called the Palace where he would serve as the rabbit in the hat of the magician the Great Presto. Eventually he would leave for Hollywood, much to the sadness of his parents, to become a star. Which he boasted that he \\"arrived just in time to save the movies from the hams who was overrunning it\\".

It can be found in Whoopee! (1928) and its film adaptation (1930), where Eddie Cantor's Jewish character transforms to \\"a Greek cook, a black errand boy, and an Indian chief\\". It can be found in the talent of Fanny Brice for \\"imitations\\". It can be found in Girl Crazy (1930), where Willie Howard transforms himself \\"to a woman, to a variety of famous performers..., to a western sheriff, to an Indian chief.\\" One example is the film To Be or Not to Be (1942) where a mixed company of actors uses their skills in adopting roles to survive in Occupied Poland.Most (2013), p. 64-75 Sources *  See also  *List of Bugs Bunny cartoons  References   External links  Category:1947 films Category:1947 short films Category:1947 animated films Category:1940s American animated films Category:1940s animated short films Category:Animated films about dogs Category:Short films directed by Friz Freleng Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:Films set in Manhattan Category:Films set in New York City Category:American gang films Category:Merrie Melodies shorts Category:American films Category:Films scored by Carl Stalling Category:Films featuring Bugs Bunny Category:Warner Bros. animated short films, 1940s ","title":"A Hare Grows in Manhattan"},{"id":"7087167","title":"The Country Girl (1954 film)"},{"id":"7087183","text":"Every Night is an album by Saturday Looks Good to Me.

Ramb I operated as an armed merchant in the Red Sea and was ordered to sail to Japan after the fall of Massawa to the Allies. She was sunk in the Indian Ocean before she could reach her intended destination.Miller, War at Sea: A Naval History of World War II, p. 140 Details and construction In the second half of the 1930s Ministry of the Colonies of the Kingdom of Italy placed an order for four ships to transport bananas from Mogadishu in Italian Somaliland to Naples. These ships had to have a large enough cargo capacity, and big endurance to be able to sail without any intermediate stops. These four refrigerating vessels were put under control of the Regia Azienda Monopolio delle Banane (RAMB) with headquarters in Rome. Two were built by CRDA at Monfalcone, and two, including Ramb I, at the Ansaldo shipyards in Sestri Ponente. Ramb I was built between October 1936 and December 1937 (hull number 308). Medium-small but very modern vessels for the era, the four RAMBs could carry approximately 2,400 tons of cargo, as well as twelve passengers. Two passengers could be accommodated in a luxury apartment with a bedroom, living room and facilities, and ten in twin bedrooms. The ship had a private deck reserved for passengers (separate from the crew), a dining room with views, and two verandas for the smokers. Passenger accommodations were air-conditioned. Ramb I could reach a speed of 18.50 knots, and its cruising speed was 17 knots, its displacement was 3,667 tons. The propulsion machinery consisted of two two-stroke FIAT diesel engines with nine cylinders. According to legislative provision, these ships were constructed with the possibility of transforming them into auxiliary cruisers, so there was enough space left on deck to accommodate four 120mm cannons. Cannons and the mat√©riel required for the military upgrade were stored in Massawa for two ships, and in Naples for the other two. During the two years of peace Ramb I transported bananas from Italian Somaliland to Venice, Naples and Genoa, and carried various goods to Mogadishu on her return journeys. Operational history On June 9, 1940, Ramb I was requisitioned in Massawa by the Regia Marina and was made a part of Red Sea Flotilla. At the time of Italy's entry into World War II, only one of four vessels was located in the Mediterranean (Ramb III), while the other three were in the Red Sea without any possibility of returning to Italy. Ramb I was upgraded in Massawa with four 120/40 cannons and two (or four) 13.2 mm Breda anti-aircraft guns. During military operations in Eastern Africa Ramb I was not very active. All her activity amounted to a single and unsuccessful raid in the Red Sea on an enemy merchant in August 1940. Apart from some short patrols along the Eritrea coast, the ship was mainly used for Massawa's anti-aircraft defense against air bombardments. With the start of Operation Compass in North Africa and the defeat of the Italian troops at Sidi Barrani on 9‚Äì12 December 1940, it became clear that it would be impossible for Italian troops in Libya to reach Italian East Africa to break its isolation. The fuel supplies were dwindling and were projected to be exhausted by June 1941.Dupuis, pp.24‚Äì26 In anticipation of the inevitable fall of the colony, a plan was developed to send as many ships as possible to Japan or occupied France and to destroy all other ships that could not make the journey. Colonial ship Eritrea, Ramb I and Ramb II were among the ships that were sent out to the Far East. Ramb I, Ramb II and Eritrea left Massawa around February 20, 1941, with both auxiliary cruisers heading to Nagasaki, and Eritrea to Kobe. After departing from Massawa, all three ships first passed by Perim evading the Royal Navy ships and Royal Air Force aircraft based at Aden and Socotra, then the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Gulf of Aden and entered the Indian Ocean. Sinking Italian ship Ramb I sinking in 1941 Royal New Zealand Navy light cruiser HMNZS Leander, which had just escorted convoy US-9 to Bombay, was sailing in the northern Arabian Sea searching for the German cruiser Admiral Scheer believed to be in the area, as well as German raider ships disguised as merchants. After receiving news of the fall of Mogadishu on February 25, 1941 captain of the cruiser, Robert Hesketh Bevan, RN changed the course north around 7:00 when HMNZS Leander was 28 miles north of the equator and 320 miles west of the Maldive Islands. He believed that some Italian ships fleeing from Italian Somaliland and heading to the Far East could travel through this area. At 5:10 (Italian time) on February 27, 1941, Ramb I navigating in the northern Arabian Sea was sighted by HMNZS Leander. The cruiser closed to less than 6 miles and signaled Ramb I with a projector to stop the engines and provide their documents (the Italian ship flew the British flag at the time). Ramb I replied with false information, and HMNZS Leander demanded the secret war code. Not being able to answer this question, Captain Bonezzi came to the conclusion that there was no alternative to fighting. The British flag was lowered and the Italian Tricolor was hoisted, and Ramb I opened fire from against the enemy cruiser, commencing a fight that lasted twenty minutes. HMNZS Leander was hit once, and replied with five salvos within the next minute, leaving Ramb I seriously damaged and on fire. She lowered her flag and HMNZS Leander stopped firing.Waters, p.21-22 HMNZS Leander came closer, and Captain Bonezzi gave an order to abandon and scuttle the ship. HMNZS Leander rescued Ramb Is captain and 112 men, of whom one later died from burns. The scuttling charges detonated shortly thereafter, causing Ramb I to sink in the position . HMNZS Leander disembarked the survivors at Addu Atoll, and the tanker Pearleaf subsequently transported the survivors to prisoner of war camps in Colombo, Ceylon.

Plot  John Lucker, a psychotic man who killed and raped the bodies of eight women, falls into a coma after trying to slit his own throat while being moved from one mental institution to another. Lucker is placed in a private clinic where he awakens, murders an orderly and takes the man's clothes. Lucker exits the clinic and hijacks the orderly's car after killing the man's girlfriend and having sex with her body. The next morning, Lucker listens to a radio broadcast discussing his escape, and Cathy Jordan, a woman who survived being taken captive and tortured by Lucker three years ago. Lucker abandons his stolen car and walks into town while having flashbacks to his time with Cathy, which excite him to the point of prompting him to disembowel a female jogger in a parking garage. Using a public phonebook and map, Lucker pinpoints Cathy's current address, which he gains entry to by soliciting a prostitute who lives there. Once in the building, Lucker shackles the hooker to her bed, stabs her in the throat and takes up residence in her apartment, which he spies on Cathy from. One month after killing the prostitute, Lucker has sex with her severely decomposed corpse, cuts it up, places the pieces in garbage bags and goes to throw them out. On the way out, Lucker runs into Cathy's boyfriend who he strangles and bludgeons while two women enter the building to visit the prostitute. After disposing of one of the hooker's friends and capturing the other, Lucker goes to Cathy's apartment and captures her as well. While Lucker rants and thrashes about, he guts the prostitute's other friend in front of Cathy. Cathy manages to escape the chair she is tied to and stabs Lucker in the back with his own knife. The wounded Lucker chases Cathy through the building and is seemingly killed when Cathy shoves him down the elevator shaft. However, as the credits roll, a recovered Lucker is shown walking out of the building.

In 2019, TetroVideo released a 72 minutes French version for the first time on DVD.  Reception  Bloodtype Online praised Nick Van Suyt's performance and the soundtrack, and called the film \\"repulsive and groundbreaking\\" despite its simplicity. That website awarded the film a two and a half, as did Brutal as Hell, which described Lucker as \\"one of the most sickening, grotesque, and disturbing films in the history of horror\\" despite the weak story. The Worldwide Celluloid Massacre referred to Lucker as a \\"boring sick movie\\" and categorized it as \\"Worthless\\". A two out of seven was given by Independent Flicks, which criticized the acting, camerawork, and editing, and stated that overall the film was amateurish, boring and poorly done.

A triaxial shear test is a common method to measure the mechanical properties of many deformable solids, especially soil (e.g., sand, clay) and rock, and other granular materials or powders. There are several variations on the test. In a triaxial shear test, stress is applied to a sample of the material being tested in a way which results in stresses along one axis being different from the stresses in perpendicular directions. This is typically achieved by placing the sample between two parallel platens which apply stress in one (usually vertical) direction, and applying fluid pressure to the specimen to apply stress in the perpendicular directions. (Testing apparatus which allows application of different levels of stress in each of three orthogonal directions are discussed below, under \\"True Triaxial test\\".) The application of different compressive stresses in the test apparatus causes shear stress to develop in the sample; the loads can be increased and deflections monitored until failure of the sample. During the test, the surrounding fluid is pressurized, and the stress on the platens is increased until the material in the cylinder fails and forms sliding regions within itself, known as shear bands. The geometry of the shearing in a triaxial test typically causes the sample to become shorter while bulging out along the sides. The stress on the platen is then reduced and the water pressure pushes the sides back in, causing the sample to grow taller again. This cycle is usually repeated several times while collecting stress and strain data about the sample. During the test the pore pressures of fluids (e.g., water, oil) or gasses in the sample may be measured using Bishop's pore pressure apparatus. From the triaxial test data, it is possible to extract fundamental material parameters about the sample, including its angle of shearing resistance, apparent cohesion, and dilatancy angle. These parameters are then used in computer models to predict how the material will behave in a larger-scale engineering application. An example would be to predict the stability of the soil on a slope, whether the slope will collapse or whether the soil will support the shear stresses of the slope and remain in place. Triaxial tests are used along with other tests to make such engineering predictions. During the shearing, a granular material will typically have a net gain or loss of volume. If it had originally been in a dense state, then it typically gains volume, a characteristic known as Reynolds' dilatancy. If it had originally been in a very loose state, then contraction may occur before the shearing begins or in conjunction with the shearing. Sometimes, testing of cohesive samples is done with no confining pressure, in an unconfined compression test. This requires much simpler and less expensive apparatus and sample preparation, though the applicability is limited to samples that the sides won't crumble when exposed, and the confining stress being lower than the in-situ stress gives results which may be overly conservative. The compression test performed for concrete strength testing is essentially the same test, on apparatus designed for the larger samples and higher loads typical of concrete testing. Test execution For soil samples, the specimen is contained in a cylindrical latex sleeve with a flat, circular metal plate or platen closing off the top and bottom ends. This cylinder is placed into a bath of a hydraulic fluid to provide pressure along the sides of the cylinder. The top platen can then be mechanically driven up or down along the axis of the cylinder to squeeze the material. The distance that the upper platen travels is measured as a function of the force required to move it, as the pressure of the surrounding water is carefully controlled. The net change in volume of the material can also be measured by how much water moves in or out of the surrounding bath, but is typically measured - when the sample is saturated with water - by measuring the amount of water that flows into or out of the sample's pores. Rock For testing of high-strength rock, the sleeve may be a thin metal sheeting rather than latex. Triaxial testing on strong rock is fairly seldom done because the high forces and pressures required to break a rock sample require costly and cumbersome testing equipment. Effective stress The effective stress on the sample can be measured by using a porous surface on one platen, and measuring the pressure of the fluid (usually water) during the test, then calculating the effective stress from the total stress and pore pressure. Triaxial test to determine the shear strength of a discontinuity The triaxial test can be used to determine the shear strength of a discontinuity. A homogeneous and isotropic sample fails due to shear stresses in the sample. If a sample with a discontinuity is orientated such that the discontinuity is about parallel to the plane in which maximum shear stress will be developed during the test, the sample will fail due to shear displacement along the discontinuity, and hence, the shear strength of a discontinuity can be calculated. Types of triaxial tests There are several variations of the triaxial test: Consolidated drained (CD)  In a 'consolidated drained' test the sample is consolidated and sheared in compression slowly to allow pore pressures built up by the shearing to dissipate. The rate of axial deformation is kept constant, i.e., strain is controlled. The idea is that the test allows the sample and the pore pressures to fully consolidate (i.e., adjust) to the surrounding stresses. The test may take a long time to allow the sample to adjust, in particular low permeability samples need a long time to drain and adjust strain to stress levels. Consolidated undrained (CU)  In a 'consolidated undrained' test the sample is not allowed to drain. The shear characteristics are measured under undrained conditions and the sample is assumed to be fully saturated. Measuring the pore pressures in the sample (sometimes called CUpp) allows approximating the consolidated-drained strength. Shear speed is often calculated based on the rate of consolidation under a specific confining pressure (whilst saturated). Confining pressures can vary anywhere from 1 psi to 100 psi or greater, sometimes requiring special load cells capable of handling higher pressures. Unconsolidated undrained In an 'unconsolidated undrained' test the loads are applied quickly, and the sample is not allowed to consolidate during the test. The sample is compressed at a constant rate (strain-controlled). True triaxial test Triaxial testing systems have been developed to allow independent control of the stress in three perpendicular directions. This allows investigation of stress paths not capable of being generated in axisymmetric triaxial test machines, which can be useful in studies of cemented sands and anisotropic soils. The test cell is cubical, and there are six separate plates applying pressure to the specimen, with LVDTs reading movement of each plate. Pressure in the third direction can be applied using hydrostatic pressure in the test chamber, requiring only 4 stress application assemblies. The apparatus is significantly more complex than for axisymmetric triaxial tests, and is therefore less commonly used. Free end condition in triaxial testing The Danish triaxial in action Triaxial tests of classical construction had been criticized for their nonuniform stress and strain field imposed within the specimen during larger deformation amplitudes.ROWE, P W, Barden, L, \\"IMPORTANCE OF FREE ENDS IN TRIAXIAL TESTING\\" Journal of Soil Mechanics & Foundations, Volume: 90 The highly localized discontinuity within a shear zone is caused by combination of rough end plates and specimen height. To test specimens during larger deformation amplitude, \\"new\\" \\"New Oedometer and New Triaxial Apparatus for Firm Soil\\" and \\"improved\\" version of the triaxial apparatus were made. Both the \\"new\\" and the \\"improved\\" triaxial follow the same principle - sample height is reduced down to one diameter height and friction with the end plates is canceled. The classical apparatus uses rough end plates - the whole surface of the piston head is made up of rough, porous filter. In upgraded apparatuses the tough end plates are replaced with smooth, polished glass, with a small filter at the center. This configuration allows a specimen to slide / expand horizontally while sliding along the polished glass. Thus, the contact zone between sample and the end plates does not buildup unnecessary shear friction, and a linear / isotropic stress field within the specimen is sustained. Due to extremely uniform, near isotropic stress field - isotropic yielding takes place. During isotropic yielding volumetric (dilatational) strain is isotopically distributed within the specimen, this improves measurement of volumetric response during CD tests and pore water pressure during CU loading. Also, isotropic yielding makes the specimen expand radially in uniform manner, as it is compressed axially. The walls of a cylindrical specimen remain straight and vertical even during large strain amplitudes (50% strain amplitude was documented by Vardoulakis (1980), using \\"improved\\" triaxial, on non saturated sand). This is in contrast with classical setup, where the specimen forms a bugle in the center, while keeping a constant radius at the contact with the end plates. Post-liquefaction testing. The fine sand specimen was liquefied during consolidates undrained (CU) cycles and recovered with consolidated drained (CD) cycles many times. The wrinkles formed due to the volume change imposed by iterating between CU liquefaction and draining. In a liquefied state the sample becomes soft enough to imprint thin latex. During CD cycles - stiff enough to preserve the imprinted pattern. The \\"new\\" apparatus has been upgraded to \\"the Danish triaxial\\" by L.B.Ibsen. The Danish triaxial can be used for testing all soil types. It provides improved measurements of volumetric response - as during isotropic yielding, volumetric strain is distributed isotopically within the specimen. Isotropic volume change is especially important for CU testing, as cavitation of pore water sets the limit of undrained sand strength.http://vbn.aau.dk/files/65404376/Behaviour_of_Cohesionless_Soils_During_Cyclic_Loading.pdf Measurement precision is improved by taking measurements near the specimen. The load cell is submerged and in direct contact with the upped pressure head of the specimen. Deformation transducers are attached directly to the piston heads as well. Control of the apparatus is highly automated, thus cyclic loading can be applied with great efficiency and precision. The combination of high automation, improved sample durability and large deformation compatibility expands the scope of triaxial testing. The Danish triaxial can yield CD and CU sand specimens into plasticity without forming a shear rupture or bulging. A sample can be tested for yielding multiple times in a single, continuous loading sequence. Samples can even be liquefied to a large strain amplitude, then crushed to CU failure. CU tests can be allowed to transition into CD state, and cyclic tested in CD mode to observe post liquefaction recovery of stiffness and strength.https://www.onepetro.org/conference- paper/ISOPE-I-15-114 This allows to control the specimens to a very high degree, and observe sand response patterns which are not accessible using classical triaxial testing methods.

In 1846, Kilbourntown merged with Juneautown on the east side of the river and Walker's Point to the south to create Milwaukee, today the largest city in Wisconsin. The house is thought to be Milwaukee's earliest surviving home. Description and history The house was constructed in Greek Revival style with four fluted Doric columns out front and a symmetrical floor plan. The front entrance opens into a living room, with a dining room behind and then a kitchen. A bedroom wing is attached to each side. The style was also known as Greek temple or national style. The structure was for four decades the family home of Benjamin F. Church, his wife Permilia, and their children including Ann Maria known as Hannah, Ann Augusta known as Anna, Charles, John and Susan. Benjamin, a native of Ulster County, New York, arrived in early Milwaukee on November 15, 1835, and later was a member of the Old Settlers Club. In addition to his carpentry and construction business, Benjamin held a number of local offices. Permilia was born in New Hampshire. In 1884, the house was sold to George Binzel, a bookkeeper who eventually was assistant secretary of the Valentin Blatz Brewing Company. George was one of several Binzel brothers who came to southeast Wisconsin from Germany. In 1900, George, his wife Rosa, daughter Louise and sons Paul, Albert and Clarence lived in the house. The address in this period was 501 Fourth. The Binzel family sold the house and moved away on August 10, 1922. Due to financial difficulties on the part of those who purchased the house, the structure eventually went to the city for payment of taxes. Rescue and restoration The house in its original location In the 1930s, the house was recognized as having historical value worthy of rescue for future generations to enjoy. Local Cream City brick and hand-hewn timbers were among its distinctive features. On July 20, 1936, the house was measured through the Historic American Buildings Survey. On August 21, 1936, architectural drawings of the house were prepared. At that time, due to a city renumbering project, the address of the house was 1533 North Fourth Street, Milwaukee. HABS documents state that the house was then owned by Louise Binzel. Through the Works Progress Administration or WPA, the house was restored and moved in 1938 to Estabrook Park in Shorewood, Wisconsin, north of Milwaukee. Furnishings from the 19th century were provided by the Wisconsin Society of The National Society of The Colonial Dames of America. Today The Church house, also known as the Kilbourntown House, is maintained today by the Milwaukee County Historical Society. It is open to the public on Sunday afternoons during June, July and August, with docent tours provided.

Mijares is the former WBC, WBA, and IBF Super Flyweight Champion. Cristian is the older brother of prospect Ricardo Mijares and the nephew of world title contender, Vicente Mijares.  Early life  Mijares comes from a large boxing family. His younger brother is a Lightweight prospect Ricardo Mijares and his uncle is a former world title contender Vicente Mijares.  Professional career  On June 3, 2006, Mijares knocked out Adalberto Davila in six rounds for the Mexican Super Flyweight title.  WBC Super Flyweight Championship  On September 18, 2006, he defeated former champion Katsushige Kawashima for the Interim WBC title, by a split decision. The Official scorers saw it 114-113, 113-114, 114-113. He was later promoted to full champion after reigning champion Masamori Tokuyama vacated his title on December 6, 2006, in anticipation of retiring.N.Korean boxer Tokuyama gives up WBC super-flyweight title In 2007, he defeated Katsushige Kawashima in a rematch via a tenth round knock out. On April 14, 2007, Mijares defended his title by beating two time Light Flyweight Champion Jorge Arce by unanimous decision in a particularly bloody match for Arce, who saw his first defeat since 1999. Mijares won the fight by a wide margin, with the official judges scoring the match 119-109, 118-110, 117-111, all in favor of Mijares. Mijares returned just 3 months later, beating Teppei Kikui, dominating and then stopping him in 10 rounds in front of his hometown crown in Mexico. Mijares made quick work of obscure journeyman Franck Gorjux stopping him in just 1 round. In February 2008, Mijares returned to the United States and was featured on a HBO pay-per-view under card against Flyweight Olympian Jose Navarro, the early rounds belonged to Mijares, while the middle rounds were evenly matched with Mijares finishing strong in the later rounds. Mijares retained his title with a Split Decision victory.  WBA Super Flyweight Championship  Mijares unified his WBC Super Flyweight title by defeating WBA Champion Alexander Mu√±oz via split decision on May 17, 2008. After several close opening rounds, Mijares took control with his crisp counterpunching and brilliant defense, with the win being secured by many dominant late rounds in which he managed to hurt Munoz. This win made him the WBA (Super) Champion. With the victory, Mijares earned a spot in the top 10 pound for pound list. Mijares made a return on August 30 in Mexico, where he defended his two crowns against a 38-year-old former WBC Flyweight Champion, Chatchai Sasakul. Sasakul had lost his title to Manny Pacquiao in 1998 and had not fought any world class opposition since. Mijares easily controlled the contest with his jab and counterpunching, eventually stopping Sasakul in round 3 after dropping him in the previous round. Mijares was most recently knocked out by Vic Darchinyan in the 9th round, losing his WBC and WBA Super Flyweight titles to the Armenian-born Australian in a surprising upset. Although he had three defeats prior to his bout with Darchinyan, this was the first time Mijares had been stopped. He went up in weight and challenged Nehomar Cerme√±o for the Interim WBA Bantamweight title on March 14, 2009. Mijares lost by split decision. He fought Cerme√±o again on September 12, 2009 for that same title but lost by unanimous decision. Two days later, Mijares announced his retirement from boxing.  IBF Super Flyweight Championship  On December 11, 2010, Mijares became a two-time world champion by beating IBF Super Flyweight Champion Juan Alberto Rosas. In May 2011, Cristian made his first defence, a victory over contender Carlos Rueda. Retirement On June 16, 2018, Mijares headlined his retirement card before a partisan crowd at G√≥mez Palacio, losing by third round knockout to Wilfredo V√°zquez Jr. of Puerto Rico.

J. MacQueen-Pope commented, concerning such curtain raisers: :This was a one-act play, seen only by the early comers. It would play to empty boxes, half-empty upper circle, to a gradually filling stalls and dress circle, but to an attentive, grateful and appreciative pit and gallery. Often these plays were little gems. They deserved much better treatment than they got, but those who saw them delighted in them. ... [They] served to give young actors and actresses a chance to win their spurs ... the stalls and the boxes lost much by missing the curtain- raiser, but to them dinner was more important.MacQueen-Pope, Walter James. Carriages at Eleven (1947), London: Robert Hale and Co., p. 23 Synopsis After an argument, Mr. Liverby is sulking and refusing to speak to his wife. Mrs. Liverby decides to make him jealous and writes a love letter to herself, allegedly from a young man. Mr. Liverby finds a love letter, but when he learns it was a joke he forgives her. However, the letter turns out not to be the one Mrs. Liverby had written, but another one written by a young man who has been hanging around the house for days trying to get an opportunity to speak to her. She is terrified, but her husband refuses to listen, thinking that this is another joke to try to make him lose his temper again, and he is determined to stay in a good humour. The young man eventually turns out to be Mr. Liverby's nephew who had been let go by Liverby's firm, and who has merely been trying to persuade Mrs. Liverby to put in a good word for him. Mr. Liverby agrees to reinstate his nephew, and all ends happily.

The \\\\wedge nodes are AND gates, the \\\\vee nodes are OR gates, and the eg nodes are NOT gates In computational complexity theory and circuit complexity, a Boolean circuit is a mathematical model for combinational digital logic circuits. A formal language can be decided by a family of Boolean circuits, one circuit for each possible input length. Boolean circuits are also used as a formal model for combinational logic in digital electronics. Boolean circuits are defined in terms of the logic gates they contain. For example, a circuit might contain binary AND and OR gates and unary NOT gates, or be entirely described by binary NAND gates. Each gate corresponds to some Boolean function that takes a fixed number of bits as input and outputs a single bit. Boolean circuits provide a model for many digital components used in computer engineering, including multiplexers, adders, and arithmetic logic units, but they exclude sequential logic. They are an abstraction that omits many aspects relevant to designing real digital logic circuits, such as metastability, fanout, glitches, power consumption, and propagation delay variability.  Formal definition  In giving a formal definition of Boolean circuits, Vollmer starts by defining a basis as set B of Boolean functions, corresponding to the gates allowable in the circuit model. A Boolean circuit over a basis B, with n inputs and m outputs, is then defined as a finite directed acyclic graph. Each vertex corresponds to either a basis function or one of the inputs, and there is a set of exactly m nodes which are labeled as the outputs.Vollmer 1999, p. 8. The edges must also have some ordering, to distinguish between different arguments to the same Boolean function.Vollmer 1999, p. 9. As a special case, a propositional formula or Boolean expression is a Boolean circuit with a single output node in which every other node has fan-out of 1. Thus, a Boolean circuit can be regarded as a generalization that allows shared subformulas and multiple outputs. A common basis for Boolean circuits is the set {AND, OR, NOT}, which is functionally complete, i. e. from which all other Boolean functions can be constructed.  Computational complexity   Background  A particular circuit acts only on inputs of fixed size. However, formal languages (the string-based representations of decision problems) contain strings of different lengths, so languages cannot be fully captured by a single circuit (in contrast to the Turing machine model, in which a language is fully described by a single Turing machine). A language is instead represented by a circuit family. A circuit family is an infinite list of circuits (C_0,C_1,C_2,...), where C_n has n input variables. A circuit family is said to decide a language L if, for every string w, w is in the language L if and only if C_n(w)=1, where n is the length of w. In other words, a language is the set of strings which, when applied to the circuits corresponding to their lengths, evaluate to 1.  Complexity measures  Several important complexity measures can be defined on Boolean circuits, including circuit depth, circuit size, and number of alternations between AND gates and OR gates. For example, the size complexity of a Boolean circuit is the number of gates. It turns out that there is a natural connection between circuit size complexity and time complexity. Intuitively, a language with small time complexity (that is, requires relatively few sequential operations on a Turing machine), also has a small circuit complexity (that is, requires relatively few Boolean operations). Formally, it can be shown that if a language is in \\\\mathsf{TIME}(t(n)), where t is a function t:\\\\mathbb{N} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{N}, then it has circuit complexity O(t^2(n)).  Complexity classes  Several important complexity classes are defined in terms of Boolean circuits. The most general of these is P/poly, the set of languages that are decidable by polynomial-size circuit families. It follows directly from the fact that languages in \\\\mathsf{TIME}(t(n)) have circuit complexity O(t^2(n)) that P\\\\subseteqP/poly. In other words, any problem that can be computed in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine can also be computed by a polynomial-size circuit family. It is further the case that the inclusion is proper (i.e. P\\\\subsetneqP/poly) because there are undecidable problems that are in P/poly. P/poly turns out to have a number of properties that make it highly useful in the study of the relationships between complexity classes. In particular, it is helpful in investigating problems related to P versus NP. For example, if there is any language in NP that is not in P/poly then P eqNP. P/poly also helps to investigate properties of the polynomial hierarchy. For example, if NP ‚äÜ P/poly, then PH collapses to \\\\Sigma_2^{\\\\mathsf P}. A full description of the relations between P/poly and other complexity classes is available at \\"Importance of P/poly\\". P/poly also has the interesting feature that it can be equivalently defined as the class of languages recognized by a polynomial-time Turing machine with a polynomial-bounded advice function. Two subclasses of P/poly that have interesting properties in their own right are NC and AC. These classes are defined not only in terms of their circuit size but also in terms of their depth. The depth of a circuit is the length of the longest directed path from an input node to the output node. The class NC is the set of languages that can be solved by circuit families that are restricted not only to having polynomial-size but also to having polylogarithmic depth. The class AC is defined similarly to NC, however gates are allowed to have unbounded fan-in (that is, the AND and OR gates can be applied to more than two bits). NC is an important class because it turns out that it represents the class of languages that have efficient parallel algorithms.  Circuit evaluation  The Circuit Value Problem ‚Äî the problem of computing the output of a given Boolean circuit on a given input string ‚Äî is a P-complete decision problem. Therefore, this problem is considered to be \\"inherently sequential\\" in the sense that there is likely no efficient, highly parallel algorithm that solves the problem.

Primary Holding Juveniles accused of crimes in a delinquency proceeding must be afforded many of the same due process rights as adults, such as the right to timely notification of the charges, the right to confront witnesses, the right against self-incrimination, and the right to counsel. The court's opinion was written by Justice Abe Fortas, a noted proponent of children's rights. Background On June 8, 1964, the sheriff of Gila County, Arizona, took 15-year-old Gerald Gault into custody, without notifying Gault's parents after a neighbor, Ora Cook, complained of receiving an inappropriate and offensive telephone call.. Fortas noted that it was sufficient \\"to say that the remarks or questions put to her were of the irritatingly offensive, adolescent, sex variety.\\" After returning home from work that evening to find her son missing, Gault's mother eventually located him at the county jail, but was not permitted to take him home.387 U.S. at 5. According to Gault, his friend Ronald Lewis made the call from the Gault family's trailer. Gault claims that Lewis had asked to use the telephone while Gault was getting ready for work. Then, not yet knowing to whom Lewis was speaking, Gault said, \\"I heard him, ahem, using some pretty vulgar language‚Ä¶ so I ‚Äì all I did was walk out, took the phone off him, hung it up, and told him ‚Äì I said, 'Hey, there's the door. Get out.Gerald Gault, in National Constitution Center, \\"Children under the Constitution\\" panel discussion, November 7, 2007. Judge McGhee of the Gila County superior court, acting as a juvenile court judge,387 U.S. at 5, n.1. presided over Gault's preliminary hearing the next morning, which he ended by saying he would \\"think about it,\\" and Gault remained in custody for several more days until he was released, without explanation. On Gault's release, his mother received a note from the superintendent of the detention home informing her that \\"Judge McGhee has set Monday June 15, 1964 at 11:00 A. M. as the date and time for further Hearings on Gerald's delinquency.\\" That was the family's only notification of the hearing.387 U.S. at 6. At the hearing, McGhee found \\"that said minor is a delinquent child, and that said minor is of the age of 15 years\\" and ordered him confined at the State Industrial School \\"for the period of his minority [that is, until 21], unless sooner discharged by due process of law.\\" The charge listed in the report prepared by the county probation officers was \\"Lewd Phone Calls.\\"387 U.S. at 7‚Äì8. Had Gault been convicted as an adult for a violation of ARS ¬ß 13-377, the punishment was a maximum prison sentence of two months and a fine of $5 to $50. Gault's accuser, Cook, was not present at either hearing; McGhee said \\"she didn't have to be present.\\"387 U.S. at 7. More than forty years later, Gault said, \\"I still don't know what that lady looks like.\\" With no witnesses having been sworn and the court making no transcript of either hearing, those present later disagreed about what had gone on during the June 1964 hearings. In particular, Gault's parents contested McGhee's claim that the teenager had admitted in court to making any of the alleged lewd statements. Arizona law then permitted no appeal in juvenile cases so Gault's parents petitioned the Arizona Supreme Court for a writ of habeas corpus to obtain their son's release; the Supreme Court referred the case back to McGhee for hearing. On August 17, \\"McGhee was vigorously cross-examined as to the basis for his actions.\\"387 U.S. at 8. He testified: > Well, there is a -- I think it amounts to disturbing the peace.

The other section > upon which I consider the boy delinquent is Section 8-201, Subsection (d), > habitually involved in immoral matters.387 U.S. at 8, n.5. The first law McGhee mentioned was Arizona Revised Statutes (ARS) ¬ß 13-377, which made a misdemeanor of using \\"vulgar, abusive or obscene language\\" while \\"in the presence or hearing of any woman or child.\\" Violating that law, then, would meet the ARS ¬ß 8-201(6)(a) criterion for classification as a \\"delinquent child,\\" a \\"child who has violated a law of the state or an ordinance or regulation of a political subdivision thereof.\\"387 U.S. at 9, n.6. The alternate criterion McGhee cited was that of ARS ¬ß 8-201(6)(d): \\"A child who habitually so deports himself as to injure or endanger the morals or health of himself or others.\\" McGhee found Gault delinquent for (1) on one occasion using obscene language on the telephone with a woman and (2) being \\"habitually\\" dangerous. The evidence for the latter, according to McGhee's testimony, was that (a) two years earlier there had been a vague report, which the court had not acted upon due to, in McGhee's words, a \\"lack of material foundation\\" concerning the theft of a baseball glove; and (b) Gault's admission that in the past he had made telephone calls the judge described as \\"silly calls, or funny calls, or something like that.\\"387 U.S. at 9. On that basis, Judge McGhee ordered the teenager to serve six years in juvenile detention. After McGhee dismissed the habeas petition, the Gaults appealed to the state Supreme Court (99 Ariz. 181 (1965)), based on the following: # the Arizona Juvenile Code was unconstitutional because it (a) did not require that either the accused or his parents be notified of the specific charges against him; (b) did not require that the parents be given notice of hearings; and (c) allowed no appeal; and # the Juvenile Court's actions constituted a denial of due process because of (a) the lack of notification of the charges against Gault or of the hearings; (b) the court's failure to inform the Gaults of their right to counsel, right to confront the accuser, and right to remain silent; (c) the admission of \\"unsworn hearsay testimony;\\" and (d) the lack of any records of the proceedings.387 U.S. at 10. The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the petition. The court acknowledged that the constitutionality of the Juvenile Court proceedings required adherence to due process387 U.S. at 12. but found that the Arizona Juvenile Code, in general, and the Gault proceedings, in specific, did not violate due process. The case was appealed to the US Supreme Court, where it was argued by Norman Dorsen, who later became president of the ACLU. Decision In an 8‚Äì1 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Gault's commitment to the State Industrial School was a violation of the Sixth Amendment since he had been denied the right to an attorney, had not been formally notified of the charges against him, had not been informed of his right against self-incrimination, and had no opportunity to confront his accusers. Justice Potter Stewart was the sole dissenter. He argued that the purpose of juvenile court was correction, not punishment, and so the constitutional procedural safeguards for criminal trials should not apply to juvenile trials.

Its full title bestowed by the creator was The Angel of Grief Weeping Over the Dismantled Altar of Life. This was Story's last major work prior to his death, a year after his wife. The statue's creation was documented in an 1896 issue of Cosmopolitan Magazine: according to this account, his wife's death so devastated Story that he lost interest in sculpture, but was inspired to create the monument by his children, who recommended it as a means of memorializing the woman.Cosmopolitan Magazine, cited in Unlike the typical angelic grave art, \\"this dramatic life-size winged figure speaks more of the pain of those left behind\\" by appearing \\"collapsed, weeping and draped over the tomb\\". The term is now used to describe multiple grave stones throughout the world erected in the style of the Story stone. A feature in The Guardian called the design \\"one of the most copied images in the world\\". Story himself wrote that \\"It represents the angel of Grief, in utter abandonment, throwing herself with drooping wings and hidden face over a funeral altar. It represents what I feel. It represents Prostration. Yet to do it helps me.\\" Prominent replicas of the Angel of Grief sculpture include the Henry Lathrop monument, located in the Stanford Arboretum at Stanford University. Lathrop was the brother of Jane Stanford, the co-founder of the university. The original replica was built in 1901, but was severely damaged in the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, leading to its replacement in 1908. After years of neglect, the 1908 replacement was fully restored in 2001. Another example is the Cassard angel, erected around 1908 in the Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. The image has also been used in popular culture, such as in an album cover for the band Nightwish's album Once (2004) and in the 2012 film The Woman in Black.

Freshman through graduate courses are offered and students can earn college credits for the purposes of transfer to another college (for completing a degree), or students may complete their degree program on-site. Participating institutions The four participating institutions for the University Center are: * Murray State College, a community college located in Tishomingo, Oklahoma; * East Central University, located in Ada, Oklahoma; * Southeastern Oklahoma State University, located in Durant, Oklahoma; and * Oklahoma State University‚ÄìOklahoma City (an academic unit of Oklahoma State University located in Stillwater, Oklahoma). Institutional History In 1974, the Oklahoma Legislature created a pilot higher education program called the Ardmore Higher Education Program (which eventually became the University Center of Southern Oklahoma) and housed it on the campus of Ardmore High School; 110 students enrolled in the first semester and chose from among ten college courses. By 1977, the pilot program was made permanent by statute and was placed under the administration of the Office of the Chancellor for Oklahoma Higher Education. By the early 1980s, (due to increasing enrollment) a new building was constructed on property belonging to the Ardmore School District (funded, in part, from an endowment from the Noble Foundation). With more space, enrollment expanded to more than 750 students (with more than 90 college courses then available). At that time, the institution was formally known as the \\"Ardmore Higher Education Center.\\" In 1985 new legislation was passed and an independent governing Board of Trustees was established, with its members appointed by the Governor of Oklahoma. Enrollment has continued to expand over the past two decades and, as of 2012, the institution provides educational opportunities to nearly 1,800 students (on average) per semester; the students have more than 300 courses from which to choose during the fall and spring semesters, and 90 during the summer session. Degree programs offered UCSO offers degree programs in the following areas of academic study: * Associate's degree; * Bachelor's degree (criminal justice, business management, elementary education, counseling, and nursing); and * Master's degree (business administration, education, human resources, and psychological services). Students who do not pursue a degree may enroll in courses that further their professional credentials as elementary school teachers, school administrators, school psychologists, school psychometrists, and licensed professional counselors. All degree programs are fully accredited through one of the four participating colleges.

The route follows a generally northwest to southeast progression; however, the portion of the route within Franklin County runs north‚Äìsouth and is signed in the same manner. The western terminus of NY 374 is at a junction with U.S. Route 11 in the village of Chateaugay. Its eastern terminus is at an intersection with NY 22 north of the city of Plattsburgh. Most of the alignment of NY 374 is located in the Adirondack Park, heading along the shorelines of several large lakes in the northern part of the park, including the two Chateaugay Lakes and Chazy Lake. The route serves as the major road in the area of the Adirondacks for most of its length, and as a major arterial in Plattsburgh. NY 374 was assigned in the 1930 state route renumbering from NY 3 in Cadyville to the state line. It was extended eastward to NY 22 in Plattsburgh in the 1970s following the completion of an arterial bypassing northern Plattsburgh. Until 2017, NY 374's western terminus was at the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border north of the village of Chateaugay, where the road continued north as a local road to Route 202. This route is now maintained by Franklin County and designated as County Route 52\\\\. Route description Canadian border and the Chateaugay Lakes region NY 374 in Chateaugay NY 374 begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 11 (US 11, named Main Street), where it follows Depot Street and becomes maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). The route continues southward out of Chateaugay and back into the local forests and fields, where it passes to the east of High Falls Park. At the intersection with Pulpmill Road, NY 374 continues to the southeast, losing any sight of development around the highway. The route parallels Healey Road and intersects with Number Five Road, where the highway moves around in different directions. The route continues along the Chateaugay River and into Brainardsville, where it intersects with NY 190 (Military Turnpike) and CR 24 (Brainardsville Road). The route leaves Brainardsville shortly after the intersection with Reynolds Road. NY 374, after leaving the community of Brainardsville, heads southwestward through some local residential developments before an intersection with Davis Road, where it turns to the southeastward. The route continues in this direction, intersecting with the western terminus of Forge Road (CR 54), a former alignment of NY 190 that heads eastward to the Clinton County line. NY 374 becomes very undeveloped again before following the shores of Lower Chateaugay Lake's eastern side. The route follows the short length of the shoreline. At the point where the lake turns into the Chateaugay Narrows, NY 374 enters the Adirondack Park and Clinton County. In Clinton County, NY 374 continues along the Narrows, intersecting with Harris Road, which is a dead-end local road. The route continues southward, intersecting with Narrows Road, which crosses over the Narrows and enters a partially developed community. The route continues to the southeast running along the eastern shoreline of Upper Chateaugay Lake. A short distance later, NY 374 heads to the east, along the shoreline into Merrill, a small community in the area. The road is moderately developed, until curving to the southeast and away from the shoreline of Upper Chateaugay Lake. Lyon Mountain to the Plattsburgh arterial NY 374 is from Dannemora in Plattsburgh After leaving the shorelines of the lakes, NY 374 intersects with Sunset Road, which is a local road heading to the southwest back to the lake. The route continues to the southeast, entering the community of Lyon Mountain, where it intersects with Bradley Pond Road (CR 2). The route continues into the moderately developed community, where it intersects with Standish Road (CR 1). The route here turns eastward, intersecting with local roads before leaving the community of Lyon Mountain and back into the undeveloped rural areas. NY 374 continues through the undeveloped regions of the Adirondack Park and heads along a northeastern pace to an intersection with Chazy Lake Road (CR 29) on the shores of Chazy Lake. NY 374, which runs along the northern shoreline of the lake, serves as the northern terminus of Chazy Lake Road. The route continues along the northeastern shoreline and direction along Chazy Lake before turning to the southeast at a bend in the highway. NY 374 continues now on an eastward progression away from the lake becoming developed residentially once again. The route then intersects with Plank Road (CR 8) and begins a southeastern progression. The route turns to the south, heading along with the deep forests in the Adirondack Park. NY 374 continues southward for a couple of miles along with the forests, making a bend in the curve into the village of Dannemora. In Dannemora, NY 374 heads eastward, intersecting with Emmonds Street, where it becomes highly developed commercially and residentially. The route progresses eastward, passing a large commercial strip, intersecting with General LeRoy Manor Road (CR 26), where it leaves Dannemora. After leaving the village of Dannemora, the route heads to the southeast and back into the forests of the Adirondack Park. NY 374 continues eastward, progressing to the north of downtown Cadyville. The highway turns to the northeast once again, entering Cadyville, where the route approaches an interchange with NY 3\\\\. At this interchange, NY 374 becomes a bypass, remaining a two-lane route with at-grade intersections with local roads, like Rand Hill Road, as it bypasses Cadyville and West Plattsburgh, paralleling NY 3\\\\. After West Plattsburgh, NY 3 curves to the southeast to intersect NY 22B, and NY 374 remains on an eastern track, intersecting NY 190, which intersected back in Brainardsville. Remaining a two-lane arterial, the road parallels other main east-west roads like Tom Miller Road (CR 26), NY 3 (Cornelia Street) and Rugar Street. Just before its final junction with NY 22, the road widens to a divided four-lane highway in preparation for the nearby junction of Interstate 87 and curving into one-way streets in the city of Plattsburgh. History Eastbound terminus of NY 374 at NY 22 in Plattsburgh NY 374 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It initially began at the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border north of the village of Chateaugay and ended at an intersection with NY 3 in Cadyville, a small hamlet within the town of Plattsburgh. At the time, NY 3 was the primary east‚Äìwest highway into the city of Plattsburgh. In the early 1970s, a new highway was constructed north of NY 3 between NY 374 and NY 22 just outside the Plattsburgh city limits. The roadway effectively supplanted NY 3 as the main east‚Äìwest road into the city; in fact, a section of the highway was built within of NY 3\\\\. The highway was completed by 1973 as an eastward extension of NY 374. On April 1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of NY 374 from its junction with US 11 in the village of Chateaugay to the Canadian border was transferred from the state of New York to Franklin County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. This section of NY 374 is now co-designated as CR 52. NY 374 gained notoriety during the manhunt for prison escapees Richard Matt and David Sweat from Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora in June 2015\\\\. The New York State Police shut down a section of NY 374 from Dannemora to West Plattsburgh.

Belmont Avenue (3200 N) is a major east-west street in Chicago and some suburbs. Belmont starts at the Belmont harbor area and is a central commercial street in Lakeview and, west of the North Branch of the Chicago River, Avondale. Further west, it anchors the Belmont-Central shopping district straddling the Belmont Cragin and Portage Park communities. The road enters western suburbs River Grove and Franklin Park before the main segment ends with other parts of Belmont still going west. Then west of the Cook County line parts of Belmont enter DuPage County, specifically in Bensenville and Addison, ending. Belmont Avenue was the southern border of Riverview Park. The amusement park remained open from 1904 until 1967. The park's property is now home to the Riverview Plaza shopping center, the Belmont District Police Station, and DeVry Institute of Technology. One of the landmarks on Belmont Avenue was the Bally Manufacturing Corporation complex located between Washtenaw and Rockwell. The building featured neon signage with the Corporate logo that looked beautiful when illuminated. Address was 2640 West Belmont, 60618. Bally also had two buildings on the south side of the street; a Parts and Lithograph (print shop) department. There were numerous buildings in the surrounding neighborhood as well. Bally moved manufacturing and eventually the Corporate office to the west side of Chicago and to the western suburbs of Bensenville and Franklin Park starting in the late 1970s. The complex was sold in 1984 and after being occupied by Moloney Coachbuilders, it was sold and demolished to make way for modern luxury housing in 1997.

Career Her first album, Scissors in my Pocket, was largely recorded and produced by herself at her home. A second album, Cosmic Rosy Spine Kites (a virtual anagram of the title of the first album) features the same tracks, four of which were recorded with a string quartet (and without guitars or percussion); the rest at a gig in Manchester, England, where she supported Jamie Cullum. Apart from Jamie Cullum she has also supported other artists on tour including Marianne Faithfull and Coldplay and played at the Glastonbury Festival in 2005. As well as using computer-based methods to self-produce her first album, Paulusma and her management have arguably made good use of the internet and contemporary methods of distribution to reach a larger potential audience: signed to One Little Indian Records, two of Paulusma's tracks (\\"Over the Hill\\" and the live version of \\"She Moves in Secret Ways\\") were issued as free downloads through Apple's iTunes Store. This has possibly led to greater exposure for a niche artist on a UK-based independent record label than might otherwise have been expected or previously possible. Paulusma has also used her profile at Myspace, her own website, blogs on both websites and a link to a forum on the latter to connect with her fans and keep them up-to-date on her touring and recording plans. Paulusma's third album Fingers and Thumbs was released in the June 2007 with its corresponding sister album Fights and Numbers as an iTunes-only digital download. Paulusma founded a small record label called Wild Sound Recordings Ltd in 2012 and in 2012 released Leaves from the Family Tree with its corresponding sister-album The Small Feat of my Reverie in 2014. Since 2012 Wild Sound has signed nine indie folk artists including Maz O'Connor, Stylusboy, Harry Harris, Matthew The Oxx, Dan Wilde and Mortal Tides. Performing and writing, Paulusma also supervises Cambridge English undergraduates in Practical Criticism as part of the English Tripos, and is also a postgraduate CHASE scholar at the University of East Anglia where she is researching the influence of traditional folksong on the writings of the British novelist Angela Carter. Personal life Paulusma is the daughter of medieval historian Jonathan Riley-Smith. Her daughter, Valentine Constance Mae, was born on 10 November 2006 (coincidentally Polly's own birthday). The cover shoot was done when Polly was 38 weeks pregnant. Her son Corentine Prosper George, was born on 1 August 2008. Paulusma and her husband, Mick Paulusma, lived in the thinnest home in London for 12 years.

According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, In income share model, both parents responsible for the children for contributing financially to the children. Income shares tables calculating child support are not based directly on actual spending on children but rather on indirect estimates of child costs. Income shares model depend on that a child receive the same proportion of parental income and also it assumes that child costs reflect the spending necessary to restore a family's standard of living back to what it was prior to the divorce or having a child. It is very reasonable for the children who their parents divorced. It is consistent with the Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act. This technique was first developed in the 19th century to answer economic questions among different family types, but was never intended to measure the cost of rearing children. The purpose of the income shares- child support lead to more fair and regular fundamental child support awards. Also, governments should regard different political balances that are equality and transparency. Approximately half of all guidelines for child support in the United States are based on the income shares child support model. The income shares model for child support was developed by economist Dr. Robert G. Williams and was based on the work of Thomas Espenshade. Espenshade analyzed the 1972‚Äì1973 Consumer Expenditure Survey to determine the costs of raising children in the United States.DHHS Sponsored Research Report: \\"Evaluation of Child Support Guidelines\\" (see Chapter 1.2.2, Income Shares Model) at http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cse/pubs/1996/reports/gdl/chap1.htm The number of states using the income shares model is decreasing. Forty states are using the income shares model in the U.S.A : Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wyoming, Guam, Virgin Islands. Child support and the income shares have some purposes like these are creating a support for children consistent with the suitable needs of children and parents to pay, making child support orders coherent and giving guidance to courts and parents to set child support. Child support is prorated between each parent depend on their total income.  Child Support Guidelines and Transition to Income Share Model  Child support guidelines are used to calculate support spendings. These ones have replaced court assumed support payments in the late 1970s and the government mandated that in 1988. There are two different types of guidelines about encouragement of divorce: Income shares and percentage of obligor income. In the parents who have high income, obligor income models are unstable and it has problematic process. So, most government have turned to income share model from percentage of obligor income. Problems of divorce results are usually resolved with income share models.  Income Shares Calculations  Calculations is related with how much money is necessary to grow a child in that a certain country. There are too many factors for calculating the amount of cost which child should receive each month: Adjusted gross income of parents, special needs the child can have, including mental or physical illnesses which may require the parents, time that parents spend with the children, medical costs, child care expenses, extraordinary school costs and healthcare insurance .Totally incomes of the parents form the income shares calculations. The court decides that how much incomes the child needs to fulfill primary costs. Also, the number of children is so important for the court order. Finally, It determines how much each of the parents support to the total income. In some conditions, the court can decide to change an existing child support judgement. It can increase or decrease the amount of child support.The non-custodial parent pays the money to the custodial parent for the child. The custodial parent pays all of the money straight to the child's needs. Forty states of U.S.A have taken into account this process since 2019. The net income of each parent, the income shares guidelines are tied to the actual costs of raising a child ‚Äî as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics'  Health Insurance  The total insurance premium of the child add to the basic child support. There are the rate based on the parents' net incomes. If one of them pays the health insurance, they receive credit for pay. The parents start the insurance coverage for the children. If the parents have no health insurance, one of these parents have to provide the health insurance when they are available.  Medical Expenses  Court can want from parents to contribute to these obligations. It can usually be in same rate as net incomes.  Child Care Expenses  Child care expanses are proportional for parents. It contains after/before school cares.  Some Strong Aspects and Failings of Income Shares  When the income increases, the rate of spending income of child support decreases. Also, researchers claimed that the income shares depend on economic researches. One study has suggested that the underlying economic data failed to reflect true child-related expenditures in upper income families including such non- consumer expenditures as principal on home, savings, and trusts for the benefit of children. Thus, the income shares model does not accomplish the goal of ensuring that parents, after they break up, continue to spend on the children the same percentage of income that they would have spent if they were together.  Important of Income Shares and Child Support  Divorce usually affect women negatively. In contrast to men, divorce causes decreasing of the women's economic welfare. Bartfeld (1997) estimates that one year after separation, not only did mothers and children lose, on average, 35 to 45% of needs-adjusted income, but 31% of mothers lived below the poverty threshold. Income shares is one of the policies that support the women for child-care in the divorce process. Bartfeld (2000) uses the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and finds that though custodial mothers remain more economically disadvantaged than noncustodial fathers, child support narrowed the gap in needs-adjusted incomes by 30%. *Bradley Amendment *California Child Support Guideline Review *Child Support Agency (UK) *Child Support Agency Australia *Child support in the United States *Costs of raising a child References External links * Income Shares at GuidelineEconomics.comAdvisory Panel on Child Support Guidelines (U.S.) Williams, Robert J. \\"Development of Guidelines for Child Support Orders: Advisory Panel Recommendations and Final Report\\", II-68 to II-75.

Early life and education Joyce was born in the Sydney suburb of Strathfield. She attended the Methodist Ladies' College, Burwood, and went on to study at the University of Sydney graduating B.Sc. in 1931. Following graduation she was made a botany demonstrator and worked on her Masters, which she received in 1933. She became a member of both the Linnean and Royal societies of New South Wales. Career Vickery was offered the position of assistant botanist at the National Herbarium of New South Wales in August 1936, she refused the position on the grounds that she would not be paid the same wage as a man with her qualifications.Claire Hooker, Vickery, Joyce Winifred (1908 - 1979), Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 16, Melbourne University Press, 2002, pp 452-453. After negotiations which increased the pay offered, she accepted the position and was the first female researcher appointed to the New South Wales Herbarium. Lilian Ross Fraser and Vickery co-discovered Lomandra hystrix, which they published in Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales, 62: 286 1937. At the herbarium she began work on plant taxonomy, her major project was the taxonomy of the large grass group Gramineae and she received her D.Sc. in 1959 for her work on the taxonomy of Poa. In 1960 she came to wider public attention when she was called on the New South Wales Police to identify plant fragments in the kidnap and murder of Graeme Thorne in August 1960.

Purcell also designed an athletic shoe that bears his name, which is still popular today.sneaker shown here. Early years Born in Guelph, Ontario, Purcell excelled at tennis and golf as a child. He took up badminton in 1924, and rose quickly in Ontario's amateur ranks. Purcell won five consecutive Ontario championships from 1927 to 1931, and was the Canadian National Badminton Champion in 1929 and 1930. Purcell became the leading badminton player in Canada, which led him to write a badminton column for the Toronto Star. In 1931, Purcell traveled to England, having beaten all his competitors in Canada. There, he won the Surrey Doubles but got only as far as the semi-finals in the All-England Championships. World badminton champion After his trip to England, Purcell returned to Canada only to learn that he was stripped of his amateur status. The Canadian Badminton Association claimed that his Toronto Star articles made him a paid professional. As a professional badminton player, however, Purcell beat all the leading players in the world by 1932. He was declared world champion in 1933 based on his beating the top Canadian, American and British badminton players. His world championship status was challenged numerous times, but Purcell remained unbeaten until his retirement in 1945. Retirement and later years In 1950, the Canadian Press named Purcell as Canada‚Äôs Outstanding Athlete of the 20th Century in the miscellaneous sports category. He was inducted into the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame in 1973 despite having never played in the Olympic Games. At the time of his induction badminton was still not an Olympic sport. In 1955, he was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame. Outside of sports, Purcell was a stockbroker and a member of the Toronto Stock Exchange. He died in Toronto in 1991 at age 87. Shoes Purcell designed a low, bleached-white canvas-and-rubber badminton sneaker for the B.F. Goodrich Company, known as PF Flyers in 1935. The shoe would provide better support on badminton courts because of a steel shank embedded in its heel. For most of the twentieth century, Jack Purcell's tennis sneaker was required wear on all grass and clay tennis courts in the United States and, at least for a time, on newer, all-weather asphalt courts as well. Unlike basketball sneakers (running shoes hadn't been invented yet), Jack Purcell sneakers had perfectly flat soles, unmarred by grooves that could tear up clay or grass and skew the elasticity of tennis ball bounces. Everyone from the youngest learner to professional and amateur tennis stars on the international tour wore Purcell sneakers; no other company made them. In 1972, Converse purchased PF Flyers (now owned by New Balance), along with the trademark rights of Jack Purcell sneakers. When Nike purchased Converse in 2003, Jack Purcell sneakers were kept in production, and are still manufactured today. Jack Purcell sneakers strongly resemble Converse Chuck Taylor All-Stars, except that Jack Purcell shoes have somewhat better arch support and cushioning, and have the trademark blue \\"toe smile\\" in front. Classic Purcell tennis sneakers are unchanged in appearance from their heyday in the 1950s and 1960s, when they were first nicknamed \\"Blue Tips\\" and \\"Smilies\\", but they have risen in price from about $20 in 1965 to as much as $150 or more today.

Before 2001, the 2nd division league was the second-highest division in Iranian football league system, however, this was changed to third-highest division when Iran's football structure officially became professional. The league consists of two, fourteen team groups who play each other twice in a home and away format. The first and second placed teams in each group are automatically promoted to the Azadegan League. The bottom two teams in both groups are automatically relegated to the 3rd division. If teams in the promotion or relegation spots are tied in terms of points, a home and away series will be played. The team with the best aggregate score will either avoid relegation or win promotion. Sometimes these rules are not followed exactly. For example in the 2005‚Äì06 season, Deihim Ahvaz should have been relegated, but Nozhan Mazandaran despite finishing ahead of Deihim, were relegated instead because of the club's poor financial situation. Additionally the number of teams in each group was increased from twelve to fourteen this season.

He joined the band in 1967, shortly after they achieved their first charting hit, \\"Sunday Will Never Be the Same\\", and stayed for three studio albums and a live concert recording. The band collapsed after the 1968 death of Malcolm Hale, and Seiter accepted a position as drummer for The Turtles, replacing John Barbata. The Turtles recorded one final studio album, Turtle Soup, then disbanded as well. Seiter next joined Rosebud for their eponymous debut, but shortly after the album's release the band collapsed in the wake of the divorce of members Judy Henske and Jerry Yester.

Joe's education was at Presbyterian College in Deer Lodge, Montana, and the University of California at Berkeley. After college he opened an assay office and operated a gold and sapphire mine, but a growing interest in geology led him to the USGS. He was appointed to the Survey in 1909 and retired in 1941.

Gomez left his home in Portugal when he was 18 and made his way to San Francisco. According to his obituary, he arrived in the city penniless, and \\"friends said his unrecorded charities had kept him that way\\". He landed his first job as a \\"swamper\\" in a local gin-joint on the infamous Barbary Coast. He managed to save enough to buy a small bar at 848 Pacific Avenue. During Prohibition, with his Isadore Gomez' Caf√©, he became known as the city's most beloved violator of the Volstead Act. In 1933, he served a 30-day jail term for bootlegging. Ten years later, in February 1943, Gomez received a presidential pardon. One of Gomez's great fans was the Armenian-American writer William Saroyan. His famous play The Time of Your Life is about Gomez and is set at Izzy's saloon. Saroyan wrote in his journals that Gomez's place was downtown, \\"not far from the old Montgomery block, across from the firehouse at First and Pacific\\".

Every website has a specific target audience and requires the most relevant content to attract business. Content should contain keywords (specific business-related terms, which internet users might use in order to search for services or products) aimed towards improving a website's SEO. Generally, a website content writer who has got this knowledge of SEO is also referred to as an SEO Content Writer. Most story pieces are centered on marketing products or services, though this is not always the case. Some websites are informational only and do not sell a product or service. These websites are often news sites or blogs. Informational sites educate the reader with complex information that is easy to understand and retain.  Functions  There is a growing demand for skilled web content writing on the Internet. Quality content often translates into higher revenues for online businesses. Website owners and managers depend on content writers to perform several major tasks: # Develop, write content as per the business concept. # Check for keywords or generate a keyword, and research limitations for the keywords. # Create or copy edit to inform the reader, and to promote or sell the company, product, or service described in the website. # Produce content to entice and engage visitors so they continue browsing the current website. The longer a visitor stays on a particular site, the greater the likelihood they will eventually become clients or customers. # Produce content that is smart in its use of keywords, or is focused on search engine optimization (SEO). This means the text must contain relevant keywords and phrases that are most likely to be entered by users in web searches associated with the actual site for better search engine indexing and ranking. # Create content that allows the site visitors to get the information they want quickly and efficiently. Efficient and focused web content gives readers access to information in a user-friendly manner. # Create unique, useful, and compelling content on a topic primarily for the readers and not merely for the search engines. Website content writing aims for relevance and search-ability. Relevance means that the website text should be useful and beneficial to readers. Search-ability indicates usage of keywords to help search engines direct users to websites that meet their search criteria. There are various ways through which websites come up with article writing, and one of them is outsourcing of the content writing. However, it is riskier than other options, as not all writers can write content specific to the web. Content can be written for various purposes in various forms. The most popular forms of content writing are: * Blogging * Writing white papers * e-books * Newsletters * Promotional mails (content for email marketing purpose) * Social media management and promotion * Brochures * Flyers * or any other offline or online marketing purposes The content in website differs based on the product or service it is used for.  Online writers vs. print writers  Writing online is different from composing and constructing content for printed materials. Web users tend to scan text instead of reading it closely, skipping what they perceive to be unnecessary information and hunting for what they regard as most relevant. It is estimated that seventy-nine percent of users scan web content. It is also reported that it takes twenty-five percent more time to scan content online compared to print content. Web content writers must have the skills to insert paragraphs and headlines containing keywords for search engine optimization, as well as to make sure their composition is clear, to reach their target market. They need to be skilled writers and good at engaging an audience as well as understanding the needs of web users.  Content writing providers  Website content writing is frequently outsourced to external providers, such as individual web copywriters or for larger or more complex projects, a specialized digital marketing agency. It shall be said that most of the content writers also spend time learning about digital marketing with more focus on Search Engine Optimization, Pay Per Click, Social Media Optimization etc. so that they can develop right content which can help clients with marketing business easily. Digital marketing agencies combine copy-writing services with a range of editorial and associated services, that may include brand positioning, message consulting, social media, SEO consulting, developmental and copy editing, proofreading, fact checking, layout, content syndication, and design. Outsourcing allows businesses to focus on core competencies and to benefit from the specialized knowledge of professional copywriters and editors.

Etymology  The marudai is generally made of a close-grained wood and consists of a round disk (kagami or \\"mirror\\") with a hole in the center, supported by four legs set in a base. The Japanese style marudai is often about 16\\" (40 cm) high and is used while kneeling or when placed on a table. The Western style 26\\" marudai allows the braider to sit in a chair to braid. The warp threads that form the braid are wound around weighted bobbins called tama. Tama were once made of clay, but now are most commonly wood filled with lead. The weight of the tama maintains even tension on the warp threads, and is balanced by a bag of counterweights called omori that is attached to the base of the braid. Modern braiders often replace the marudai with a foam disk with numbered slots that tightly grip the warp threads so that no weighted bobbins are needed to maintain tension on them. Instead flexible plastic bobbins are used to prevent tangling of the threads. Unlike kumihimo disks, marudais have no indication of where the thread should be placed; it is done freehand.

Description Compared to the Roma tomato, San Marzano tomatoes are thinner and more pointed. The flesh is much thicker with fewer seeds, and the taste is stronger, sweeter and less acidic. The San Marzano vines are indeterminate and have a somewhat longer season than other paste tomato varieties, making them particularly suitable for warmer climates. As is typical of heirloom plants, San Marzano is an open- pollinated variety that breeds true from generation to generation, making seed saving practical for the home gardener or farmer. Commercial production and use Amy P. Goldman calls the San Marzano \\"the most important industrial tomato of the 20th century\\"; its commercial introduction in 1926 provided canneries with a \\"sturdy, flawless subject, and breeders with genes they'd be raiding for decades.\\" Though commercial production of the San Marzano variety is most closely associated with Italy, seeds for the variety are available worldwide.. It is an heirloom variety. Canned San Marzanos, when grown in the Valle del Sarno (valley of the Sarno) in Italy in compliance with Italian law, can be classified as Pomodoro San Marzano dell'Agro Sarnese-Nocerino and have the EU \\"DOP\\" emblem on the label. Most San Marzano tomatoes sold commercially are grown in Italy, though they are produced commercially in smaller quantities in other countries. Because of San Marzano's premium pricing, there is an ongoing battle against fraudulent product. On November 22, 2010, the Italian carabinieri confiscated of improperly labelled canned tomatoes worth ‚Ç¨1.2 million. San Marzano tomatoes, along with Pomodorino del Piennolo del Vesuvio, have been designated as the only tomatoes that can be used for Vera Pizza Napoletana (True Neapolitan Pizza). Origins San Marzano tomatoes originate from the small town of San Marzano sul Sarno, near Naples, Italy, and were first grown in volcanic soil in the shadow of Mount Vesuvius. One story goes that the first seed of this tomato came to Campania in 1770, as a gift from the Viceroyalty of Peru to the Kingdom of Naples, and that it was planted in the area of San Marzano sul Sarno. In the United States, San Marzano tomatoes are the genetic base for another popular paste tomato, the Roma tomato. The Roma is a cross between a San Marzano and two other varieties (one of which was also a San Marzano hybrid) and was introduced by the USDA's Agricultural Research Service in 1955.

Advantages  * A business can develop a dependable stance in a market, as consumers have a well-rounded price before the service is undertaken. For instance, a technician may charge $150 for his labor. * Potential costs can be covered. The service may result in inevitable expenses like the parts needed to fix the issue or the items required to complete the order. * No restricted structure is needed, as the pricing system can be adjusted to suit the business using it. Management can thus work out the pricing that best matches the company's objectives, efforts, costs, etc.  Disadvantages  * The fixed pricing restricts the company's capability to meet the needs of individual consumers, and people search for cheaper alternatives. * Pricing competition thickens, with other companies in the same industry compete for the lowest pricing, and tough competition occurs. * Inflation can cause unprecedented losses, and companies must raise the charge to keep up with costs.  Postage  There are flat rates in the postal service, regarding the delivery of items. Postage companies use different forms of post, boxes or envelopes, to avoid having to weigh items. The on-hand cost lets consumers identify the cost and removes the hassle of estimate the cost for items. The United States Postal Service offers flat-rate pricing for packages selling different postage options varying in size and shape. That provides consumers with an array of options upfront, creating a sense of ease. When shipped in higher volumes, it saves money but there are issues if both the flat rate and regular delivery systems are used simultaneously.  Advertising  Flat rate also passes into advertising. Purchasing advertisements on websites such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube is sold a flat rates on the size (with a surcharge for images and posts) and length of the advertisement (video costs extra). Advertising on YouTube pitches at a flat rate of $0.30 per view. When a person runs by the YouTube home page, search page, or wherever the ad is running, the charge is $0.30.  Tradesmen  Tradesmen such as electricians, plumbers, and mechanics, also often charge flat rates to cover their labour for their services. In a survey in 2014 in Australia, the average labour rate for a painter was $39.92 per hour. Telephony American telecommunications companies commonly offer a flat rate to residential customers for local telephone calls. However, a regular rate or Message Rate is advantageous for those who make only a few short calls per month. Flat rates were rare outside the US and Canada until about 2005, but they have since become widespread in Europe for both local and long-distance calls and are now also available for mobile phone services, both for traditional GSM/UMTS voice calls and for Mobile VoIP. Most VoIP services are effectively flat-rate telephony services since only the broadband internet fees must be paid for PC-to-PC calls, and the calls themselves are free. Some PC-to-telephone services, such as SkypeOut offer flat rates for national calls to landlines. Television Premium television or Pay TV usually charges a flat monthly fee for a channel or a bundle or \\"tier\\" of channels, but some Cable television companies also offer Pay per view pricing. Internet For Internet service providers, flat rate is access to the Internet at all hours and days of the year (linear rate) and for all customers of the telco operator (universal) at a fixed and cheap tariff. Flat rate is common in broadband access to the Internet in the US and many other countries. A charge tariff is a class of linear rate, different from the flat rate, where the user is charged by the uploads and downloads (data transfers). Some GPRS / data UMTS access to the Internet in some countries of Europe has no flat rate pricing, following the traditional \\"metered mentality\\". Because of this, users prefer using fixed lines (with narrow or broadband access) to connect to the Internet. A wavy rate is not a linear rate, because the Internet surfer pays the monthly fixed price to use the connection only during a certain range of hours of the day (i.e. only in the morning or, more typically, only at night). Electricity A \\"flat rate\\" (more accurately known as fixed rate) for electricity is a fixed price per unit (kWh), not a fixed price per month, and thus different from that for other services. An electric utility that charges a flat rate for electricity does not charge different rates based upon the demand that the customer places on the system. A customer pays the same amount whether they use the electricity in bursts during mid-day, when demand and the utility's costs are highest, or if they spread it out over the entire day. However, if the customer uses a different amount of electricity, they are charged a higher or lower amount. Residential customers and small businesses are usually charged a flat rate, though not the same rate per kilowatt-hour. A special type of electricity meter, a time of use meter, is required to charge a non-flat rate. Time of use meters can lower a customer's electricity bill, if they use electricity mostly during off-peak hours. Some utilities will allow a customer to change to a time of use meter, but they charge for the cost of the meter and installation. Real estate In real estate, \\"flat rate\\" is an alternative, nontraditional full service listing where compensation to the listing agent is not based on a percentage of the selling price but instead is a fixed dollar amount that is typically paid at closing. The rate is generally less than a gross 6% commission, resulting in a lowered cost of selling real estate. \\"Flat rate\\" is different from \\"flat fee\\" in several ways: i) it is generally substantially more than a \\"flat fee\\" rate; ii) it generally represents a full service listing as opposed to a \\"flat fee\\" limited service listing; and iii) it is usually paid at closing, as opposed to a \\"flat fee\\", which is usually paid when the listing agreement is executed. Transport In most parts of the world regular users of public transport, especially commuters, make use of weekly, monthly or yearly season tickets that allow unlimited travel for a fixed fee. In some countries year passes are available for the entire national railway network (e.g. the Bahncard100 in Germany for about ‚Ç¨3000 and the Oesterreich Card offered by the Austrian Federal Railways). Some, such as the Eurail Pass, are intended for foreigners, in order to encourage tourism. Road users are normally charged a combination of fixed and variable fees, in the form of vehicle duty and fuel duty. Motorway tolls in some countries (Switzerland, Austria, Czech Republic, Slovenia) are paid by purchasing weekly, monthly or annual stickers attached to the windscreen. At some stage, the concept of the flat rate was even introduced into passenger air traffic in the form of American Airlines' AAirpass. Parcel/document delivery In dealing with the shipping of parcels and documents, a \\"flat rate for international deliveries of packet size #1\\" would mean that the same shipping charge (for example US$15.00) would be applicable to all packets of this size, regardless of their designated destination (country of recipient), and regardless of the quantity of their contents, i.e. whether they contained one sheet of paper or were filled to the maximum. Labor Flat rate is a pricing scheme whereby the customer pays a fixed price for a service regardless of how long the worker takes to carry out the service. Flat rate manuals are based on timed studies of the typical time taken for each type of service. Flat rate helps provide a uniform pricing menu for service work and helps establish the worth of performing a particular job. In recent times some automotive companies have begun using computer algorithms to calculate labor times with a high degree of accuracy. The benefit to the customer is that if a worker takes longer than this, the cost does not rise. The downfall to the customer is that this can lead to overpaying in some cases. The benefit to the worker is that it promotes incentive to learn how to do the work more efficiently. This system can also cost the worker if they do not perform a job within the allotted time such as in the case of an inexperienced worker or on a job where there is something preventing the service from being performed that the labor manual can't take into account. In automotive shops this is common due to rusted, seized, or stripped bolts or aftermarket installations. In some circumstances automotive technicians can get paid 0 hours for working a 12-hour day. It can be difficult to compare prices between hourly-paid and flat-rate services, and this sometimes causes rejection of flat rate shops over hourly ones. Medical One of the newest areas where flat rate pricing is just beginning to make inroads is the medical industry. The concept has held a particular interesthttp://blogs.aafp.org/fpm/noteworthy/entry/flat_rate_medicine_the_future because of the high and rising costs of health care delivery despite legislative attempts to address them, such the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikepatton/2015/06/29/u-s-health- care-costs-rise-faster-than-inflation/ While there have been pilot programs launched by major insurance carriers such as UnitedHealthcare to control costs in the most costly medical conditions like cancer,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-flat-rate-pricing-help-control-cancer- costs/ for now the primary application of flat-rate pricing has been in medical imaging, such as x-rays, MRIs, mammograms, and ultrasounds. Regional companies such as Med Health Services Inc.http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/blog/the-pulse/2015/02/med-health- introduces-flat-rate-pricing.html in the Pittsburgh area and Northwest Radiology Network of Indianapolishttp://www.auntminnie.com/index.aspx?sec=ser‚äÇ=def&pag;=dis&ItemID;=111135 have been among the first in the nation to implement the practice on a trial basis.

Topography  Glenamoy is a general term for the following townlands: * Bellagelly North (B√©al a Ghoile meaning \\"mouth of the stomach\\") * Bellagelly south (B√©al a Ghoile meaning \\"mouth of the stomach\\") * Baralty (Barr Altaigh meaning \\"hills/cliffs/anything high\\") * Bunalty (Bun Altaigh meaning \\"base of the hills/cliffs\\") * Gortleatilla (Gort Liatuile meaning \\"field of the little grey stream\\") * Srahnaplaia (Srath na Pl√°ighe meaning \\"holm of the plague\\") * Pollboy (Poll Bu√≠ meaning \\"yellow hole\\") * Lenarevagh (An L√©ana Riabhach meaning \\"grey meadows\\") * Barrooskey (Barr R√∫scaigh meaning \\"moory or marsh land\\") The townlands of Glenamoy make up the inland portion of Kilcommon Parish which is, in the main, a coastal area. Because so much of Glenamoy is pretty remote in nature and consisting of large expanses of blanket bog, it covers an area of some of land. Two rivers flow through this townland conglomerate. They rise in Glencalry (Belderrig) townland. The Owenmore River flows via Carrowmore Lake into Blacksod Bay where a tributary of it known as the Munhin River connects the area with the great Ulster Cycle saga of T√°in B√≥ Flidhais, the Glenamoy River into Sruwaddacon estuary and Broadhaven Bay. Lace schools were one of the more common industries in the area in the past. There were several shooting lodges in this area where the landlords held shooting parties for the gentry in the 19th century. The habitations in Glenamoy are spread out across a wide area today unlike other habitations in the parish which tend to be clustered, a remnant of the Rundale system of agriculture which was commonplace here for many years.  Glenamoy Bog Complex  Glenamoy Bog Complex is a large site situated in the north-west of Erris, incorporating both inland and coastal regions. The climate is wet and oceanic and there are frequent strong winds across the area which is largely treeless and relatively exposed. The bog complex area is drained by four main river systems - the Glenamoy, the Muingnabo, the Belderg and the Glenglassra rivers. Extreme oceanic blanket bog dominates the site in its inland areas. The coastal habitats of Glenamoy bog complex are extensive and varied. Sea cliffs dominate the coastline reaching a height of 253 metres at Benwee Head. There are many steeply sided islands off the coastline which are mainly used a summer grazing for livestock if the area of machair on them is large enough.  Sport  Former Mayo goalkeeper Irwin hails from Glenamoy.

Palmitoylation of a cysteine residue Left Palmitoylation (red) anchors Ankyrin G to the plasma membrane. Right Close up. Palmityl residue in yellow. Palmitoylation of Gephyrin Controls Receptor Clustering and Plasticity of GABAergic Synapses Palmitoylation is the covalent attachment of fatty acids, such as palmitic acid, to cysteine (S-palmitoylation) and less frequently to serine and threonine (O-palmitoylation) residues of proteins, which are typically membrane proteins.Linder, M.E., \\"Reversible modification of proteins with thioester-linked fatty acids,\\" Protein Lipidation, F. Tamanoi and D.S. Sigman, eds., pp. 215-40 (San Diego, CA: Academic Press, 2000). The precise function of palmitoylation depends on the particular protein being considered. Palmitoylation enhances the hydrophobicity of proteins and contributes to their membrane association. Palmitoylation also appears to play a significant role in subcellular trafficking of proteins between membrane compartments, as well as in modulating protein‚Äìprotein interactions.Basu, J., \\"Protein palmitoylation and dynamic modulation of protein function,\\" Current Science, Vol. 87, No. 2, pp. 212-17 (25 July 2004), http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/jul252004/contents.htm In contrast to prenylation and myristoylation, palmitoylation is usually reversible (because the bond between palmitic acid and protein is often a thioester bond). The reverse reaction in mammalian cells is catalyzed by acyl-protein thioesterases (APTs) in the cytosol and palmitoyl protein thioesterases in lysosomes. Because palmitoylation is a dynamic, post-translational process, it is believed to be employed by the cell to alter the subcellular localization, protein‚Äìprotein interactions, or binding capacities of a protein. An example of a protein that undergoes palmitoylation is hemagglutinin, a membrane glycoprotein used by influenza to attach to host cell receptors. The palmitoylation cycles of a wide array of enzymes have been characterized in the past few years, including H-Ras, GsŒ±, the Œ≤2-adrenergic receptor, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). In signal transduction via G protein, palmitoylation of the Œ± subunit, prenylation of the Œ≥ subunit, and myristoylation is involved in tethering the G protein to the inner surface of the plasma membrane so that the G protein can interact with its receptor. Mechanism S-palmitoylation is generally done by proteins with the DHHC domain. Exceptions exist in non-enzymatic reactions. Acyl-protein thioesterase (APT) catalyses the reverse reaction.Lanyon-Hogg, T., Faronato, M., Serwa, R. A., & Tate, E. W. (2017). Dynamic Protein Acylation: New Substrates, Mechanisms, and Drug Targets. Trends in Biochemical Sciences, 42(7), 566‚Äì581. doi:10.1016/j.tibs.2017.04.004 Other acyl groups such as stearate (C18:0) or oleate (C18:1) are also frequently accepted, moreso in plant and viral proteins, making S-acylation a more useful name. Several structures of the DHHC domain have been determined using x-ray crystallography. It contains a linearly-arranged catalytic triad of Asp153, His154, and Cys156. It runs on a ping-pong mechanism, where the cysteine attacks the acyl-CoA to form an S-acylated DHHC, and then the acyl group is transferred to the substrate. DHHR enzymes exist, and it (as well as some DHHC enzymes) may use a ternary complex mechanism instead. An inhibitor of S-palmitoylation by DHHC is 2-Bromopalmitate (2-BP). 2-BP is a nonspecific inhibitor that also halts many other lipid-processing enzymes. The palmitoylome A meta-analysis of 15 studies produced a compendium of approximately 2,000 mammalian proteins that are palmitoylated. The highest associations of the palmitoylome are with cancers and disorders of the nervous system. Approximately 40% of synaptic proteins were found in the palmitoylome. Biological Function Substrate presentation Palmitoylation mediates the affinity of a protein for lipid rafts and facilitates the clustering of proteins. The clustering can increase the proximity of two molecules. Alternatively, clustering can sequester a protein away from a substrate. For example, palmitoylation of phospholipase D (PLD) sequesters the enzyme away from its substrate phosphatidylcholine. When cholesterol levels decrease or PIP2 levels increase the palmitate mediated localization is disrupted, the enzyme trafficks to PIP2 where it encounters its substrate and is active by substrate presentation. Synapse formation Scientists have appreciated the significance of attaching long hydrophobic chains to specific proteins in cell signaling pathways. A good example of its significance is in the clustering of proteins in the synapse. A major mediator of protein clustering in the synapse is the postsynaptic density (95kD) protein PSD-95. When this protein is palmitoylated it is restricted to the membrane. This restriction to the membrane allows it to bind to and cluster ion channels in the postsynaptic membrane. Also, in the presynaptic neuron, palmitoylation of SNAP-25 directs it to partition in the cell membrane and allows the SNARE complex to dissociate during vesicle fusion. This provides a role for palmitoylation in regulating neurotransmitter release.\\"Molecular Mechanisms of Synaptogenesis.\\" Edited by Alexander Dityatev and Alaa El-Husseini. Springer: New York, NY. 2006. pg. 72-75 Palmitoylation of delta catenin seems to coordinate activity- dependent changes in synaptic adhesion molecules, synapse structure, and receptor localizations that are involved in memory formation. Palmitoylation of gephyrin has been reported to influence GABAergic synapses.

Opened on April 10, 1916, The Strand is the tenth longest operating movie theater in the United States. History The theatre opened on April 10, 1916. It was first owned by Henry Bieberson. The building was originally the New York Cash Store, a department store built in 1908. Near the exit of the theatre, one can see the original opening announcement from The Journal Herald, printed on April 8, 1916. The Strand has never been closed since its opening. Schine Theatres was a chain of theatres run out of Gloversville, NY. The chain had operated 170 movie theatres in 6 different states during their operation. In 1971 a previous Schine manager and his wife, George and Cindy Johnson, bought the single screen theatre. They presided over a renovation which included adding two more screens; in 1982 the second screen was added in the adjoining storefront, and in 1986 the original balcony was walled off and turned into its own screen. George and Cindy eventually retired back to Greece, selling The Strand to Jerry and Cathy Amato on February 11, 1994. The Amatos operated the theatre until Ohio Wesleyan University took ownership in 2002. The Amatos kept the theatre running during a rough time in its history. This was an effort to preserve its place in the community of Delaware city and in history. When OWU took ownership, they helped create the Strand Theatre and Cultural Arts Association, a 501 (c) 3 Non-profit board that currently owns the Strand. On February 12, 2009 the Strand Theater & Cultural Arts Association received an award for the renovations made to the concessions area, and the restoration of the second floor windows. The Strand's manager at the time, Kara (McVay) Long, also received an award recognizing her efforts to promote the community and causes.Main Street Delaware gives awards ThisWeek Community News In 2010, the Strand announced plans for $5 million in renovations. The renovations planned to add digital projectors (which did occur), add three more screens, a blade with the Strand's name on the marquee, and a back entrance within the next three years. The Strand requested $50,000 in economic development funds each from Delaware County and the City of Delaware for new seats and wall coverings.Strand Theatre seeks public fundingBrand new Strand ‚Äî Changes ahead for historic downtown movie theatre On October 4, 2010, Delaware County commissioners granted $175,000 for renovations to the Strand.Commissioners OK $150k for Strand The theatre continued showing movies on 35mm film until 2012. The final movie shown on motion picture film at the Strand was The Dark Knight Rises; all movies exhibited there since have been digital. In 2016, The Strand commemorated 100 years of continuous operation with its Century of Cinema celebration. A strip of stars in the sidewalk outside as well as a plaque inside indicate the donors that made renovations possible. A short documentary on the history of the theatre was also created at this time. Presently, The Strand is still running as a non-profit. They partner with local businesses and community members to sustain the theatre as an icon of the city of Delaware. They consistently show first-run films as well as host community events.

The Complete Book of Great Australian Women. Harper Collins. She was also the first woman in Australia to fly in a heavier-than-air craft in 1909 and the first female member of the UK's Institution of Structural Engineers in 1926. However, she is best known for her role as publisher, editor and writer for the influential building industry trade journals established in 1907 with her husband George, which she ran and expanded after his death in 1928 until her retirement in 1961.Willis, Julie and Bronwyn Hanna \\"Women Architects in Australia 1900‚Äì1960\\" Royal Australian Institute of Architects, 2000 Early life Taylor was born at Bedminster, in Somerset (now a part of Bristol), England to John Parsons and Eliza (n√©e Brooks), working class parents who described themselves as \\"stone quarryman\\" and \\"washerwoman\\" in the British census of 1881. Her family migrated to Australia when she was a child, arriving in Sydney in 1884 after a short stint in Queensland. Her father soon found work as a draftsman-clerk with the Parramatta Council, and also in the sewerage construction branch of the NSW Department of Public Works. According to her official although unpublished biography by Kerwin Maegraith, Taylor attended a nearby public school where she says she received a \\"good education\\".Hanna, Bronwyn Hanna \\"Absence and Presence, A Historiography of Early Women Architects in New South Wales\\", PhD, University of New South Wales, 1999, online at Career Following the deaths of her mother in 1896 and father in 1899, Taylor was forced to find work to help support herself and her two younger sisters. She eventually found a position as a clerk in the Parramatta architectural practice of Francis Ernest Stowe, an acquaintance of her father's.. Inspired by the example of draftspeople in the same office who were earning far more than herself, she enrolled in night classes at the Sydney Technical College where she became the first woman to complete final year studies in architecture in 1904. During her architecture course Taylor was articled to the architect Edmund Skelton Garton. Although she had fond memories of being mentored by Garton, she later recalled that other workers in the office were less encouraging. Soon after completing her articles, she went on to work in the busy and prestigious office of John Burcham Clamp, where she claimed she was made chief draftsperson. Clamp was her champion for an unsuccessful application to become the first woman member of the NSW Institute of Architects. With Clamp's strong support in 1907, Taylor applied to become the first female member of the Institute of Architects of New South Wales. However she was not accepted at this time, and she later claimed to have been \\"blackballed\\" by a groundswell of hostility from the all-male membership who did not wish to admit a woman member. She did become the first woman member of the Institute, but not until 1920 when she accepted their invitation to join as an associate member.\\"A Woman Architect\\" The Farmer and Settler, 29 October 1920 She was admitted as a full member in 1923. In April 1907, Taylor married Sydney-born artist, inventor, and craftworker George Augustine Taylor at St Stephen's Presbyterian Church in Sydney. George Taylor had lectured her at college and was a close friend of her first employer Francis Ernest Stowe. On 5 December 1909, Taylor became the first Australian woman to fly a heavier- than-air craft, in a glider built by her husband in his Redfern workshop, from the Narrabeen sandhills near Sydney. They were both passionate about architecture and town planning, amongst many other interests and activities. Max Freeland described them as \\"possibly the most amazing couple in Australia's history\\".Freeland, J.M. (1971) The Making of a Profession, Angus & Robertson, Sydney Within a few months of their wedding George and Florence Taylor had established a publishing company, Building Publishing Co. Ltd that specialised in building industry journals, spearheaded by Building magazine, three journals of which Florence edited: Harmony, Young Australia and the Australian (later Commonwealth) Home. According to garden historian Richard Aitken, 'Gardening, although not expressly covered by Building, was treated nonetheless as an integral part of design, both at a domestic level and on a broader public scale'.Aitken, R., ‚Äò‚ÄúReturn to Lutyens\\": Florence Taylor and the folly of architecture', Australian Garden History, 19 (3), 2007/08, pp. 15‚Äì17. Taylor's secretary was Mary Emily Haworth (1901‚Äì1998), who was the maternal grandmother of Australian artist Kathy Panton (1969‚Äì). Journalist John Canner (1882‚Äì1978) also worked on \\"Building Ltd\\" where he met and later married Mary Haworth. For some years following their marriage the Taylors lived in Bannerman Street, Cremorne, in a house designed by the innovative architect, Henry Austin Wilshire, before moving to an apartment on Loftus Street, Sydney, where their publishing business was also located. In 1913 they were founding members of the Town Planning Association of New South Wales, and Florence served as its secretary for many years. Following her husband's sudden death, drowning in his bath associated with an epileptic fit in 1928, Taylor maintained their publishing business and while forced to close eight of their eleven journals, she maintained Building (later Building, Lighting and Engineering) (1907‚Äì72), Construction (1908-74) and the Australasian Engineer (1915‚Äì73), editing them herself and expanding significantly after World War II. She continued to produce town plans and also travelled to Asia, the Americas and Europe bringing back ideas on town planning which informed her writings and speeches. She published a book about her town plans in 1959, authored by her employee J.M. Giles, Fifty years of town planning with Florence M. Taylor. Taylor was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1939 and elevated to a Commander of that order in 1961. Retirement and death Taylor retired in 1961 at 81 years of age, and lived in Potts Point. She died there on 13 February 1969 and was cremated with Anglican rites. Her estate was valued for probate at $226,281. Legacy In some of the many interviews where she told her life story, Taylor suggested that she had designed up to 100 houses in Sydney during her stint as an architect between 1900 and 1907. Although she left no easy records specifying where these were located, some aspects of her design work have now been documented. In 1907 she worked with her employer John Burcham Clamp on the basement of the Farmers Department store in Pitt Street Sydney, perhaps the first example of a woman contributing to commercial architectural design in Sydney. Also in 1907 she provided a perspective drawing for the winning competition entry for the Commercial Traveller's Building in Sydney (which was demolished to make way for the MLC Centre in the 1970s). Again in 1907 she won prizes in several architectural design sections of the \\"First Australian Exhibition of Women's Work\\" in Melbourne in 1907. Her winning design for a kitchen was published in the NSW Institute of Architects' journal in November 1907. Her second-prize winning design for a seaside cottage had to waited another 50 years before being published in one of her own journals, Construction, on 24 December 1958. Further research has uncovered houses probably designed by Taylor at 12 Florence Street, Cremorne, Hogue House on Kareela Road, Cremorne, and a house built in the 1920s for her sister Annis on Thomas Street, Roseville. Taylor's legacy as a town planner is more extensive. Throughout her career she produced town planning schemes which were published in her journals and Fifty Years of town planning with Florence Taylor (c1959). Many of the ideas she advocated for Sydney have come to fruition in recent decades including a harbour tunnel crossing, an eastern suburbs distributor freeway, the construction of \\"double-decker streets\\" such as the Victoria Street overpass across William Street at Kings Cross, increased building of apartments especially in harbourside localities such as Woolloomooloo and North Sydney, more flexible mixed-use zoning (including longer shopping hours), making Sydney more attractive for tourism and the need to conserve and plant trees. Other ideas have proved unpopular or incorrect, such as her desire to demolish Hyde Park Barracks or build heliports in the CBD and her contention that the Sydney Opera House would be a white elephant.Freestone, Robert and Bronwyn Hanna, \\"Florence Taylor's Hats\\", Halstead Press, Sydney, 2008. Taylor was also closely involved in the Arts Club, (Royal) Aero Club of New South Wales, Society of Women Writers, New South Wales branch of the Australian Forest League, Australian-American Association, Royal Empire Society, and the Bush Book Club. The Canberra suburb Taylor was named in her honour, as were several professional awards, including the 'Florence M. Taylor Medallion' from the Master Builders Association of Victoria and the 'Florence Taylor Award' from the Queensland chapter of the Australian Institute of Building.Master Builders Association of Victoria. Apprentice of the Year Awards. Florence Taylor Street in the Canberra suburb of Greenway is also named for her. In 1930, Taylor also established the George A. Taylor Memorial Medal with the Master Builders Federation of Australia. This medal is presented annually to the winner of the \\"Building Construction Prize for completion among Technical Schools throughout the Commonwealth\\". The biography Florence Taylor's Hats: Designing, Building and Editing Sydney by Bronwyn Hanna and Robert Freestone was published in 2008 by Halstead Press . Since 2006 a three-storey high portrait of Taylor adorns an apartment building facing the railway on the southern approach to Sydney's Central railway station, which commemorates her as \\"Australia's first woman architect\\". Although this portrait also features a photograph of the beautiful Gothic Mortuary Station, located nearby, that building was completed ten years before Taylor's birth, designed by the then Government Architect James Barnet, and there is no known link between Taylor and the building. A portrait of Taylor by Jerrold Nathan is held by the Mitchell Library, Sydney.  Awards  Florence Mary Taylor was inducted into the Victorian Honour Roll of Women in 2001.

In that year a congregation of the Six Mile Run Reformed Church was formed making it the oldest congregation in Franklin Township and remains an important part of the community. The first building was replaced by a new building in 1766 and was later replaced in 1817 by a third structure on the same site. The current building replaced the 1817 church that was destroyed by fire in 1879.

Occasionally Franklin Park was referred to as Somerset Courthouse during the time the courthouse was located here. A commemorative marker is located on Route 27 between Clover Place and Bennington Parkway near the original courthouse site. Several early taverns were established here and welcomed travelers using King's Highway while headed towards New Brunswick and New York City going north and Princeton, Trenton and Philadelphia going south. Wood's Tavern was operating by 1745 and Gifford's Tavern by the 1760s. John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson are known to have stopped at Gifford's Tavern. In 1874, Gifford's Tavern was replaced by the 26-room Beekman's Hotel, aka Franklin House, which operated until it was destroyed by a major fire in 1929. The building occupied by Chauncey's Restaurant (now demolished) was purportedly once a barn of the Beekman's Hotel.Brahms, William B.

Franklin Township, Somerset County, NJ: A History, FTPL; page 414 In the late 19th century in addition to the Beekman's Hotel and another known as Manley's Hotel and the Six Mile Run Reformed Church, the community included a wagon factory, blacksmith, wheelwright, butcher, hay scales, ice house, a school, and a general store called Hullfish's Store, as well as residences for about 110 people. Today many of the historic commercial buildings are gone but newer commercial buildings have taken their place to serve the rapidly growing population in the surrounding area. The former Franklin Park School on Route 27, built in 1909, was a two-room building until three more rooms were added in 1931. Renamed the Phillips School in 1954 in honor of Jane E. Phillips, who had earlier invested in a school to be built by that name in honor of her late husband at Ten Mile Run (closed since 1931) and established a trust fund for graduates of the Phillips school to attend New Jersey State Teachers College at Trenton (most recently known as The College of New Jersey), it ceased being used as a public school in 1976. The building was then used by Franklin Township's Recreation Department until 1993 when it was abandoned due to structural problems.Brahms, William B.

Originally on channel 85, Met Opera Radio was shifted to channel 78 on June 24, 2008. It is also on Dish Network channel 6078. It carries live broadcasts from the Metropolitan Opera two to three times each week during the opera season. In addition, throughout the day performances are presented from among the 1,500 recorded broadcasts in the Metropolitan Opera radio broadcast archives. The channel's host and announcer for the live broadcasts is Mary Jo Heath. The producers are Ellen Keel, John Bischoff, Matthew Principe, with William Berger as writer and commentator. Jay David Saks is the audio producer. History and description The channel was launched at 6:30 PM, September 25, 2006 the opening night of the Met season.Metropolitan Opera website \\"Who we are\\" The first broadcast was a live performance of Puccini‚Äôs Madama Butterfly, conducted by James Levine, the Met's Music Director at the time, and directed by Anthony Minghella. It starred Chilean soprano Cristina Gallardo-Dom√¢s as Cio-Cio-San, tenor Marcello Giordani as Pinkerton, and baritone Dwayne Croft as Sharpless. Metropolitan Opera Radio replaced the existing \\"Classical Voices\\" channel in the Sirius channel lineup. While opera- oriented, the \\"Classical Voices\\" channel also offered some choral music and art songs programming (such as German lieder and French Chansons). The new channel was launched as part of new Met general manager Peter Gelb's initiative to utilize technology to make the Met's performances more accessible to a wide audience. The channel was added to the XM lineup (replacing the existing \\"Vox\\" channel) on November 12, 2008, as part of the merger between Sirius and XM. Two to three live broadcasts of operas from the Met are presented each week of the Met's performing season.Initially it was four, but with 2009/2010 season it was scaled down to just three, including Saturday matinee broadcasts when applicable. The performances are hosted by Mary Jo Heath with commentator William Berger. During intermissions live interviews with performers and other opera professionals and experts are interspersed with background information and informal chat by the co-hosts. During the rest of the broadcast week, many of the Met's historic archived broadcast tapes are presented. These have been collected and re-mastered by the Met's sound archive department. When presented on Sirius, the original commentaries are replaced by introductions, which include short stories on principal performers and synopsis of each act, recorded by Margaret Juntwait. Of the Met's approximately 1500 archived broadcasts, Sirius's Met Opera Radio presented over 570 in its first three years.MetOpera archives (database) Each day up to seven full length archived broadcasts are presented, starting at 6:00 AM. The channel's weekly schedule includes approximately 12 or 13 different archive recordings which are broadcast in rotation at different starting times. These broadcasts are then repeated with time-span ranging from few months to well over a year. In between the complete operas, shorter pieces of studio-recorded vocal music are presented. None of these is ever interrupted except to accommodate the start of a live broadcast. Sirius also provides the sound transmission for the Metropolitan Opera's live high- definition video opera presentations in movie theaters world wide. The traditional Metropolitan Opera Radio Network Saturday broadcasts are also presented on Sirius's Met Opera channel.

The law provides for: * Registration and regulation of broker dealers and their registered representatives * Disclosure obligations applicable to public companies, investment trusts and similar entities * Tender offer rules * Disclosure obligations applicable to large shareholders in public companies * Internal controls in public companies; in this role the law is often referred to as J-SOX, a reference to the American Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). J-SOX provisions The internal control portions of the FIEA were largely enacted in response to corporate scandals such as the Kanebo, Livedoor, and Murakami Fund episodes. The Internal Control Committee of the Business Accounting Council of the Japanese Financial Services Agency provided final Implementation Guidance for Management Assessment and Audit of Internal Controls over Financial Reporting (ICFR) in February 2007. The Implementation Guidance provides details to Japanese companies on how to implement a Management Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting as required under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law. The Financial Instruments and Exchange Act became effective in April 2008 for roughly 3,800 companies listed in Japan, along with their foreign subsidiaries. Forrester Research lists the following challenges and differences between J-SOX and SOX: * Professional services. Japan has fewer than 10% of the number of qualified accountants than the US. * Independence of auditors. While the concept of auditor independence exists in the Japanese market similar to the US, many Japanese firms can and will rely on the influence and recommendations of their audit firms. * Audit automation is critical. With the extreme shortage of auditors compared to US per capita numbers, this shortage will increase the requirement and necessity for process efficiency in the internal audit process and software that can support these processes. * Support of IT governance.

The southern terminus of the route is at an interchange with Interstate 81 (I-81) in North Syracuse, where the highway continues southeastward as I-481. Its northern terminus is located at an intersection with NY 104 in Oswego about two blocks from Lake Ontario. In between, NY 481 serves the communities of Clay, Phoenix and Fulton along the Oswego River. NY 481 is one of two state routes in the Syracuse area that serves as an extension of an Interstate Highway; the other is NY 690\\\\. From its southern terminus to the Fulton city line, NY 481 is a four-lane limited-access highway with a handful of interchanges. It enters Fulton as a four-lane undivided highway, but gradually narrows to two lanes as it heads through the northern portion of the city. North of Fulton, NY 481 becomes a four-lane divided highway and proceeds to the outskirts of Oswego, where it reverts into a two- lane roadway. NY 481 also serves as a faster alternate to NY 48 from the Syracuse area to downtown Oswego. Both travel along the Oswego River, with NY 481 on the eastern side and NY 48 on the western side. NY 481 was commissioned in 1970 from North Syracuse to Fulton and extended northward to Oswego in 1982. The portion of the route north of Fulton was designated as NY 20 from 1924 to 1927 and NY 57 from 1927 to 1982. The segment of NY 481 south of Fulton follows a newer facility that was built in the 1970s. NY 481 and I-481 comprise the Veterans Memorial Highway. Route description All of NY 481 is officially designated as part of the Veterans Memorial Highway, a designation that also encompasses the entirety of I-481, NY 481's southeastward continuation around the eastern half of Syracuse. The northernmost three blocks of NY 481 in the city of Oswego are locally maintained, as is the southernmost block in the city of Fulton. The remainder of the route is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). South of Fulton NY 481 begins in North Syracuse at an interchange with I-481 and I-81, a north‚Äìsouth highway running north to Watertown and south to Syracuse. The junction is about north of Syracuse Hancock International Airport, located on I-81. Like I-481, NY 481 is a four-lane limited-access highway with a handful of interchanges for the first of its run. Exit numbers along NY 481 pick up where those of I-481 leave off. Heading northwest from the I-81 interchange, the highway crosses U.S. Route 11 (US 11) almost immediately, passing just south of the former site of Penn-Can Mall. The road soon enters the town of Clay, where it initially runs along the northern edge of a marsh for . Near the north edge of the swamp, the freeway passes over the St. Lawrence Subdivision, a CSX Transportation rail line linking Syracuse to the North Country. NY 481 approaching exit 12 (NY 31) in Clay Past the swamp, NY 481 serves more developed areas of the town, running alongside a cluster of housing tracts on the outskirts of a large retail area centered around the highway's junction with NY 31\\\\. The commercial district comprises several strip malls and the Great Northern Mall, the latter situated northeast of the NY 31 interchange. From here, the freeway heads through markedly less developed areas, running across farmland to reach the Oneida River (Erie Canal) at the northern edge of Onondaga County. It continues across the waterway into the Oswego County town of Schroeppel, where it connects to County Route 57A (CR 57A) at a half-diamond interchange east of the village of Phoenix. NY 481 continues to run across undeveloped areas of fields and forests, even as it passes close to Phoenix. As the route heads away from the village, it connects to NY 264 at a full diamond interchange about north of Phoenix. The route is the village's main north‚Äìsouth highway, and it connects NY 481 and Phoenix to SUNY Oswego's Phoenix campus, located just southwest of the freeway. The junction with NY 264 is the last interchange on the route; however, NY 481 remains limited-access up to the Fulton city line. As the route approaches the city limits, it takes on a more westerly track, passing over CSX's Fulton Subdivision and the Sunoco Ethanol plant located in the former Miller Brewing Company breweryhttp://www.sunocoethanol.com/about/fulton-plant before intersecting CR 57 at an at-grade junction just inside the city limits. The route continues northwest from here, heading through significantly more developed areas as South 1st Street. Fulton to Oswego In Fulton, NY 481 travels slowly through the center of town, serving as the main north-south route through the city. It changes names several times, becoming South 4th Street after South 1st Street where it passes the former Nestle chocolate plant which closed in 2003,https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/02/nyregion/when-the-chocolate-melted- nestle-factory-closing-leaves-town-reeling.html and eventually South 2nd Street when South 4th Street leaves to the north. The four-lane road serves a handful of homes; however, the majority of establishments along the street are commercial. In downtown Fulton, NY 481 intersects NY 3 at Broadway, one of two streets to cross the Oswego River and connect to NY 48, a parallel route to NY 481 on the western riverbank. Past Broadway, NY 481 changes names to North 2nd Street but otherwise remains unchanged until Oneida Street, located seven blocks north of NY 3\\\\. Here, the highway narrows to two lanes, a width it retains through the remainder of Fulton and into the town of Volney. NY 481 at the junction with CR 57 in Fulton At the northern city line, NY 481 connects to the south end of CR 57's northern segment, which closely parallels NY 481 between Fulton and Oswego. Continuing into Volney, the highway briefly runs alongside the Oswego River prior to entering another lightly developed region of the county. About north of Fulton, NY 481 expands to a four-lane divided highway once more; however, it remains an at-grade roadway. The Fulton Subdivision also rejoins the road at this point, running alongside NY 481's northbound lanes to the Oswego city limits. Between Fulton and Oswego, the route serves mostly undeveloped areas but has several stretches of scenic beauty, mostly consisting of glimpses of locks, rapids and small waterfalls through trees separating NY 481 from the river. NY 481 narrows to two lanes near the southern edge of Oswego, where it separates from the Fulton Subdivision and curves northwestward as it crosses into the city limits. The road, now named East River Road, continues on this track to the banks of the Oswego River and a junction with CR 57\\\\. This is also where NY 481 passes by the Oswego County Public Safety Center, a complex comprising the county offices, courts, and a correctional facility. NY 481 continues along the east bank of the river into the main part of Oswego, initially serving a mostly residential area before entering downtown as East 1st Street. The homes continue to line NY 481 until a junction with Utica Street, one of two roads to cross the river within Oswego and thus provide access between NY 481 and NY 48\\\\. From here, NY 481 serves several businesses and the central offices of the Oswego City School District before ending three blocks north of Utica Street at a junction with NY 104 (Bridge Street), Oswego's other highway with a river crossing. Both directions of NY 104 provide access to the remainder of the city's central business district while East 1st Street continues north past NY 104 to Oswego Harbor, where Oswego River empties into Lake Ontario. History The primary north-south roadway connecting Syracuse to Oswego via Fulton on the eastern bank of the Oswego River was originally designated as Route 34, an unsigned legislative route, by the New York State Legislature in 1908. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, legislative Route 34 was designated as NY 20. NY 20 was redesignated as NY 57 in 1927 to avoid numerical duplication with the newly designated U.S. Route 20. This edition shows U.S. Routes as they were first officially signed in 1927. The NY 57 corridor remained unchanged until the late 1950s when construction began on a new roadway to replace the existing two-lane, curvy routing of NY 57 between Fulton and Oswego. It was completed by 1960. In the mid-1960s, construction began on a limited-access highway linking Fulton to I-81 in North Syracuse. The under-construction highway, initially known as \\"Relocated Route 57\\", was designated as NY 481 on January 1, 1970. The NY 481 designation also extended north to NY 3 in Fulton by way of a short overlap with NY 57. The portion of the expressway between Fulton and NY 31 in Clay was opened to traffic in the early 1970s while the rest was completed . NY 481 was extended northward to its present terminus in downtown Oswego when the NY 57 designation was eliminated in May 1982.

Riding from the age of 13, he began specializing in dressage at age 19 and competed in his first Olympics in 1984. He competed in every summer Games between 1984 and 2004, winning four team bronze medals. He also took a team bronze at the 1994 World Equestrian Games. Dover is the most honored dressage rider in the United States, and has been inducted to the United States Dressage Federation Hall of Fame. Outside of competition, Dover founded the Equestrian Aid Foundation in 1996 to assist others in the equestrian world, and hosted a TV show that searched for the next dressage star. From late 2009 to early 2011, Dover served as the Technical/Coach Advisor for the Canadian national dressage team. In April 2013, Dover was named Technical Advisor/Chef d'Equipe for the US national dressage team. Personal life Dover, who is Jewish, was born in Chicago, Illinois to parents Heb and Jean Dover. He was given a horse for his Bar Mitzvah at 13 and was active in Pony Club, graduating at \\"A\\" level, the highest level. He decided to specialize in dressage when he was 19. Dover attended the University of Georgia. He is openly gay, and his partner is fellow rider Robert Ross. He became the first openly gay Olympic athlete when he came out in 1988. Injuries, including a torn rotator cuff and pinched sciatic nerve, began to plague him in the late 1990s, causing major back pain and reducing his ability to ride. Career Competition In 1984, Dover competed in his first Olympic Games at the age of 28. At the Los Angeles Games, he finished 17th individually, and the US team finished 6th. At the 1988 Seoul Olympics, he finished 13th, and the team tied for 6th place. In 1992, at the Barcelona Games, Dover tied for 22nd place, while the American team took the bronze medal. At the 1996 Atlanta Games, the 2000 Sydney Olympics and the 2004 Athina Games the United States dressage team took the bronze medal each time, while Dover finished 25th, 23rd and 6th respectively. He was elected team captain in all six Olympics in which he competed. Of his Olympic experience, Dover says, \\"The medals themselves aren't the important thing. My memories of the Games and of the entire Olympic experience are, to me, everything.\\" In 1987, Dover defeated Reiner Klimke, a six-time Olympic gold medalist, at the German Aachen Grand Prix freestyle competition. In doing so, he became the first American in 27 years to win that event. In 1994 he was named the US Olympic Male Equestrian Athlete of the Year, and in 1995 awarded the Whitney Stone Cup, given by the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) for excellence in international competition. Dover has been named the USEF Dressage Champion five times, and ridden seven times in the FEI World Cup Final. In 1994, Dover rode with the United States dressage team at the World Equestrian Games, winning a team bronze. He was also amassed more than 100 Grand Prix victories. Overall, Dover has won more honors in dressage than any other rider from the United States. In 2009, Dover announced his retirement from competitive riding, instead choosing to focus on teaching and philanthropy. Other Dover founded the Equestrian Aid Foundation in 1996. The Foundation's mission is to financially assist members of the equestrian community who have suffered a catastrophic accident, injury or illness. In 2002, Dover was listed as one of the 50 most influential horsemen by Chronicle of the Horse magazine. In 2007, \\"The Search for America's Next Equestrian Star: Dressage\\", a reality TV show created and promoted by Dover, aired on the Fox Reality Channel with five one-hour episodes. The show followed a search for young, talented dressage riders, with the final five being allowed to train with Dover for one month before a winner was selected; the winner became Dover's assistant. In 2008, Dover was inducted into the United States Dressage Federation Hall of Fame. Dover served on the USEF Dressage Committee for many years, and spent eight years on the US Olympic Committee Athlete Advisory Council. In late 2009, Dover was selected as a Technical/Coach Advisor for the Canadian dressage team, with a contract that extended through the 2010 World Equestrian Games in Lexington, Kentucky. After the Games, it was announced that Dover and the Canadian team had not been able to agree on contract renewal terms, but in late 2010 it was announced that Dover would remain as the interim trainer for the first quarter of 2011. In March 2011, German equestrian Markus Gribbe was hired, and Dover's term as a Canadian coach came to an end. Dover is known for his coaching abilities, with some of the best dressage riders with top international titles to their credit coming from his stables. During his time as a trainer for Canada, he was no longer be eligible to train top riders with the USEF. In April 2013, Dover was named Technical Advisor/Chef d'Equipe of the US national dressage team. He is expected to remain in the position through the 2016 Summer Olympics. Dover is currently a rider and trainer at Stillpoint Farm in Florida.

History It was originally developed as an entry for the U.S. Army's Armored Gun System (AGS) competition in the 1980s.,Jackson (2010), p. 100. which called for a new light tank with the firepower of a main battle tank on an air-transportable chassis. In 1988, the Royal Thai Army pressed the Stingray in service with 106 tanks purchased. The contract was for $150 million.https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/thailand/army-equipment- intro.htmhttps://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os- xpm-1987-10-16-0150300158-story.html Cadillac Gage provided assistance in repairing some of them after they obtained reports of cracked hulls.

In 2010, Federal Defense Industries announced that they entered into an agreement with Textron Marine & Land Systems in order to provide authorized aftermarket parts, support and other types of assistance for the Stingray since FDI maintains a technical library for spare parts.https://web.archive.org/web/20190615075157/https://www.fdi.us.com/cadillac- gage In 2011, Napco entered into an agreement with Textron to provide authorized aftermarket parts, support and other types of assistance for the Stingray.http://www.napcointl.com/Napco%20General%20Presentation.pdf As of 2020, the purchase of VT-4 MBTs back on May 18, 2016https://web.archive.org/web/20160517102544/http://www.janes.com/article/60340/thailand- to-procure-mbt-3000-tanks-from-china is suggested for the possibility that the Thai Army may replace their Stingrays in service.https://21stcenturyasianarmsrace.com/2016/05/18/thailand-is-buying- the-newest-chinese-tank/https://asianmilitaryreview.com/2018/10/combat- vehicle-modernisation/ Variants Stingray The Stingray has a 105 mm bore cannon. Its cruise speed is 44 mph (71 km/h). Maximum grade is 60%. The maximum vertical distance it can scale is 2.7 feet (82 cm). It can ford water up to 3.5 feet (107 cm). It is air transportable in a C-130 cargo aircraft. The original Stingray program was launched in 1983, with the first prototype vehicle ready in August 1984. The Stingray turret was also marketed separately for retrofit installation on the hull of the M41, M47 or M551 tank or on the V600 armored car. Its armor was made from CG's Cadaloy armor. The Stingray can be upgraded with the CG Fire Control and Stabilization Upgrade Kit as an affordable solution to upgrade its fire control systems.http://www.bfbreakthroughdesign.com/textron/textronmarineland_products_land_turret.htm Stingray II The Stingray II is an upgrade version of the Stingray, developed by Cadillac Gage as a private-venture armored fighting vehicle (AFV) for the export market. The light tank's baseline armor, while thin, is adequate for a light cavalry, reconnaissance or light infantry fire support role; it protects its occupants from armor-piercing, heavy machine gun rounds up to 14.5 mm in size. Additional armor appliqu√© can be fitted to increase ballistic protection. Operational range is increased by about 25 miles (about 40 kilometers) if one assumes a travel speed of about 30 mph (48 km/h). In addition, the engine on the Stingray II has been upgraded to 410 kW (550 horsepower) at 2,300 rpm. The Stingray's main armament is a low recoil force (LRF) version of the British Royal Ordnance L7 105 mm rifled gun installed in a well-angled and electro-hydraulically powered turret having manual backup as is usually found on tanks, together with duplicate turret controls for the gunner and the commander, providing redundancy. Dimensions of the turret were deliberately designed to allow it to be refitted to M41 Walker Bulldog and M-551 Sheridan vehicles as an upgrade. The gun has optional stabilization in two axes, and eight rounds, with another 24 rounds stored in the hull. Complementing the main gun is a 7.62 mm co-axial machine gun with 2,400 rounds, as well as a 12.7 mm M2 Browning anti-aircraft machine gun with 1,100 rounds on the commander's hatch. The Stingray II is fitted with 16 protective smoke grenade launch tubes, with 8 of them on each side. The optic system for the gunner is composed of a two-axis stabilized day/night thermal imaging system called 'Hughes Hire,' made by the company then known as Hughes Electronics, together with a laser rangefinder. For the commander, there is another optical system that has seven different periscopes, and there is also a repeater display for the same thermal image seen by the gunner. The main improvements offered in the Stingray II are a more capable digital fire- control system, NBC equipment, enhanced mobility and superior target- engagement capabilities.https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/stingray-lt.htm The Stingray II also improves the armor to provide protection from 23 mm rounds. Two Stingray IIs were made to showcase its weapons and equipment for demonstration to potential customers. Other versions ;AGS-Stingray :Stingray modified for the AGS competition but lost to the FMC/UDLP/BAE Close Combat Vehicle Light which became the type-classified M8 Armored Gun System.https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/stingray-lt.htm ;AGS-Sheridan :The AGS-Sheridan was a mating of the standard M551 Sheridan hull with the turret of the Stingray light tank.

All songs were written by the Butthole Surfers, and recorded live at The Meridian in San Antonio, Texas, on March 25, 1984. This was the Surfers' final album on Alternative Tentacles. Live PCPPEP and 1983's Butthole Surfers were reissued as the Butthole Surfers/Live PCPPEP CD on Latino Buggerveil in 2003. The Latino Buggerveil re- release also contains two additional live songs from the Meridian show, \\"Gary Floyd\\" and \\"Matchstick.\\" Live PCPPEP is the first of three Surfers albums to feature clown imagery on the cover, the others being 1987's Locust Abortion Technician and 1995's The Hole Truth... and Nothing Butt. The clown illustrations on its front and back covers were later combined and recolored for The Hole Truth...'s front cover. In a bit of a rarity for the band, the back cover includes the album's track listing. Music The Surfers' first official live recording primarily contains performances of songs from the band's 1983 debut EP, Butthole Surfers (a.k.a. Brown Reason to Live, a.k.a. Pee Pee the Sailor), leading some fans and critics to joke that they released the same album twice. This isn't strictly the case, as Live PCPPEP also has one track from the then-upcoming album, Psychic... Powerless...

This album also marked the debut of the first female Surfer, Teresa Nervosa, who was one of the band's two drummers (the other being King Coffey).Butthole Surfers article at Trouser Press With her arrival, the band's core classic lineup ‚Äì Haynes, Leary, Coffey, and Nervosa ‚Äì was set. With the exception of a number of different bass players, it remained largely unchanged until Nervosa's final departure in 1989. Background Psychic..., the Surfers' first full-length album, was already complete by the time Live PCPPEP came out. Various band members have stated that they were unhappy with this recording's sound quality, but claim they had a financial need to release an album after Psychic...'s debut was unexpectedly delayed. (It was finally released three months later.)

CETS was developed in collaboration with law enforcement in Canada. Administered by the loose partnership of Microsoft and law enforcement agencies, CETS offers tools to gather and share evidence and information so they can identify, prevent and punish those who commit crimes against children. About the CETS partnership In 2003, Detective Sergeant Paul Gillespie, Officer in Charge of the Child Exploitation Section of the Toronto Police Service's Sex Crimes Unit, made a request directly to Bill Gates, CEO and Chief Architect at Microsoft at the time, for assistance with these types of crimes. Agencies experienced in tracking and apprehending those who perpetrate such crimes were involved in the design, implementation, and policy. The solution needed to assist law enforcement agencies from the initial point of detection, through the investigative phase, to arrest, prosecution, and conviction of the criminal. In addition, it was imperative that the solution adhered to existing rights and civil liberties of the citizens of the various countries. This included remaining independent of Internet traffic and any individual user‚Äôs computer. Finally, such a solution needed to be global in nature and enable collaboration among nations and agencies. In order to increase the effectiveness of investigators worldwide, such a system would allow law enforcement entities to: * Collect evidence of online child exploitation gathered by multiple law enforcement agencies. * Organize and store the information safely and securely. * Search the database of information. * Securely share the information with other agencies, across jurisdictions. * Analyze the information and provide pertinent matches. * Adhere to global software industry standards. Law enforcement partnerships worldwide A number of law enforcement agencies use or are deploying the CETS tool, these include: *Australia: High Tech Crime Centre *Brazil: Federal Police *Canada: Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Toronto Police Services Sex Crime Unit, & Twenty-six other Canadian police services *Chile: National Investigative Police *Indonesia: National Police *Italy: Ministry of Interior and Postal police *Romania: National Police *Spain: Interior Ministry *United Kingdom: Child Exploitation and Online Protection Command of the National Crime Agency. *United States: Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation * In Planning : Poland, Argentina and United Arab Emirates Child exploitation crimes have been an increasing problem as technology advances. The tracking system has a proven success rate bringing many of those who violate the law to justice. Microsoft contributed technology in creating NCMEC which furthered the development of a system which captures criminals in addition to removing offensive images. \\"Microsoft has implemented PhotoDNA on its own online properties including Bing, SkyDrive and Hotmail, which has already resulted in the identification, reporting and removal of thousands of images of child pornography\\" (Microsoft, 2013).

Vitex is one of several genera that was transferred from Verbenaceae to Lamiaceae in the 1990s as a result of phylogenetic studies of DNA sequences. It is the largest genus in the subfamily Viticoideae of Lamiaceae.

Description Vitex is a genus of shrubs and trees, from 1 to 35m tall. Some species have whitish bark that is characteristically furrowed. Leaves are opposite, usually compound. The fruit is a drupe.  Circumscription  In 2009, a molecular phylogenetic study showed that three small genera, Paravitex, Viticipremna, and Tsoongia are embedded in Vitex. These three genera were duly sunk into synonymy with Vitex. It is possible that Pseudocarpidium, Petitia, and Teijsmanniodendron are nested within Vitex. Sampling in the 2009 study was not sufficient to determine the phylogenetic position of these genera. The relationships of Teijsmanniodendron to these genera was not discussed in a revision of Teijsmanniodendron in 2009.Rogier P.J. de Kok, Go Rusea, and Abdul Latiff. 2009. \\"The Genus Teijsmanniodendron Koord.

Overview The seamstress is an unnamed twenty-year-old woman featured as a desperately poor peasant accused of plotting against the French Republic by Robespierre's Committee of Public Safety during the Terror of the French Revolution in 1793.Dickens 2003, p. 365 (Book 3, Chapter 13) Found guilty of this imaginary crime, she was condemned to death by beheading. She became acquainted with Charles Darnay during their imprisonments in La Force Prison, and was the only person to recognize Sydney Carton as an impostor as the two of them rode to their execution together.Dickens 2003, p. 366 (Book 3, Chapter 13) She spends her last moments conversing with Carton noting that he provides strength to her. The Republic executes her as the 22nd of fifty-two to be killed that day. Sydney Carton dies directly after her.Dickens 2003, p.385 (Book 3, Chapter 15) Character analysis The seamstress is described as \\"a young woman, with a slight girlish form, a sweet spare face in which there was no vestige of color, and large widely opened patient eyes\\". She often denotes herself as \\"poor,\\" \\"little,\\" \\"ignorant,\\" and \\"weak\\". Although she says she is weak, she maintains a calm temperament through her last moments as Dickens often describes her hands, eyes, and face as \\"patient\\". Her calm disposition only breaks once as she tells Carton of her cousin, five years her junior, who is her only familial relative. She remains calm as she describes that they have been separated by poverty and that her cousin will not know of her fate, but begins to tear up as she wonders if it will be a long wait before she sees her again in heaven.Dickens 2003, p.384 (Book 3, Chapter 15) She is understanding and accepting of the Republic even as she is sentenced to death. She states, \\"I am not unwilling to die, if the Republic which is to do so much good to us poor, will profit by my death\\". She only references the Republic once more as she mentions her cousin in that the Republic may extend her cousin's life to old age. Relationship with Sydney Carton The seamstress is the last person Sydney Carton speaks to before his death and acts as a powerful love interest for him in their final moments. Through her character, Dickens provides hope and closure to the story of Sydney Carton as he subjects the reader to believe that they will be together in the afterlife. After she realizes that Carton has sacrificed himself for Darnay, she calls him \\"brave and generous\\", the sole character of the book to overtly do so (other characters have only alluded to his potential for goodness). She asks Sydney Carton to hold her hand as she rides with him to the guillotine, a request to which he readily acquiesces. As they get off the carriage, Carton continues to hold her hand until she is called to death. They share a brief kiss before she goes to die. Though they share only a moment together, their relationship is one of the most profound and moving of the entire novel. Carton's last meaningful action in his life is to provide solace to the seamstress in her last moments, in which Dickens effectively continues his theme of redemption in the novel as Carton moves on to a supposed better life. Literary significance and criticism Doris Y. Kadish describes the seamstress as \\"a humble heroine of the revolution,\\"Kadish 1991. while \\"Lisa Robson (Modern Criticism, pp. 97-101) and other feminist critics draw on late- twentieth century studies of the role of women in the French Revolution to offer new perspectives on...the seamstress...\\"Glancy 2006, pp. 57-8 and Beth Harris writes that \\"the anonymous seamstress in A Tale of Two Cities, who has 'done nothing,' re-establishes a narrative horizon that charts its length along the great actions of men...\\"Harris 2005, p.63 Cinematic and theatrical portrayals In the 1911 film version, Norma Talmadge played the seamstress, although in this version Sidney Carton ascends the scaffold before her, and her death is not actually depicted.Pointer and Slide, p.27 In the 1935 film version, the seamstress is played by Isabel Jewell.Smith 1991, p.159 In the 2008 Broadway adaptation of A Tale of Two Cities, the seamstress was played by MacKenzie Mauzy.Broadway World, June 30. 2008 Notes References *Dickens, Charles.

It was the first shareware game to feature music for the AdLib sound card. Dark Ages was distributed as shareware. It consists of three episodes, with only the first episode playable in the shareware version. The episodes are: #Prince of Destiny #The Undead Kingdom #Dungeons of Doom The game was released as freeware on March 20, 2009, and for Steam with Windows and Mac OS support in 2015. Plot As a child, the Prince of the Great Kingdom was sent away by the power-hungry wizard Garth, to be raised by peasants. This turns out to be Garth's greatest mistake as one of the peasants is a retired hero who trains the Prince to be a master fighter using magic as a weapon. In the years after Garth's conquest, the kingdom had fallen into ruin and despair, with no hope of returning to the times of happiness and prosperity. Garth ruled with an iron fist and terrorized the population with undead creatures. The prince battles through badlands, castles, dungeons, caves, forests and finally to the Great Kingdom itself, with Garth's army of undead creatures attacking at every turn. After a confrontation between the Prince and Garth and after killing the evil wizard, the prince's destiny is fulfilled, having freed the kingdom from the Dark Ages of fear and tyranny. The prince assumes his rightful place as the peaceful King and Leader of the Kingdom. The Great Kingdom is once again free to prosper and grow without fear. Gameplay Dark Ages is a side- scrolling game where the playable character, the prince, can move sideways, jump and shoot. Gameplay involves killing and avoiding enemies and jumping over obstacles. Progression to the next level often involves a hidden door, revealed by one of several Wise Men-type characters after retrieving an item for them. The items include a key, a shield, and an apple. The player can use magic to fight the prince's enemies, starting out with a simple energy bolt and slowly gaining access to more destructive spells as the game progresses. There are three spells in the game: a blue bolt that flies straight forward, a boomerang that flies forward then returns allowing enemies to be hit twice, and a magic beam with a shorter range but can kill most enemies in one hit and can be fired in rapid succession. Development When Todd Replogle first designed the game, the graphics were drawing slowly. With some aid from the Apogee members (who were still working for Softdisk at the time), the game was improved to run at a faster and smoother pace.

Known as \\"Mr. Long Island\\", Arthur Roth played a key role in the development of Long Island banking from 1926 through the 1970s. Roth started as a messenger at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company at age 17 and rose quickly through the ranks. He began his career at Franklin National Bank in 1934 as a cashier and worked his way up to become the chief executive in 1946. In 1964 Franklin made a bold move to open branches in New York to counter a threat that New York City banks would move to Long Island and Franklin would not have the international services offered by the city's banks. During his tenure, Franklin National Bank became the 18th largest bank in the United States. Under Roth's leadership, Franklin National Bank was the first bank to issue credit cards, as well as the first to offer drive-in teller services. However, they were never well-received and became the bank of last resort for those who could not have solid banking relationships with the big city banks. Competitive loan rates and high deposit costs caused Franklin to be vulnerable to fluctuations in a new computerized interest rate environment. In July 1968, Roth was removed from his position as chief executive due to growing loan losses and a declining stock price. His removal was precipitated by press accounts of his son Donald's connection with land deals in Suffolk County. Harold V. Gleason, then president, wanted Roth out and bad press was the best way to get rid of Roth. Some claim Roth overextended the bank by aggressively pushing into the New York City real estate market. Among other close connections the bank had, was with Webb and Knapp, developers of Roosevelt Field, on whose board Roth sat. As real estate values in New York dropped in the following years, Franklin National Bank was stressed with millions of dollars of questionable loans. The directors from a merger with the Federation Bank were persuaded by Gleason not to nominate Roth for another term as director, and Roth left the bank in 1970. Gleason then became chairman and chief executive officer, inviting Laurence Tisch to join as vice chairman as he was a 22% shareholder. Tisch served in an inactive manner until he sold his stock to Michele Sindona, \\"The Popes Banker\\", in 1972. Gleason had spent much energy to attract Sindona to the bank as a savior to supply resources to save the failing bank. Sindona was interested in providing money laundering services for his financial customers in Italy. The favoritism for Sindona's ability to take over Franklin by the Nixon administration skirted major requirements for fiduciary responsibility, which later caused no small inconvenience to Lawrence Tisch. His shadow purchase of Franklin for Sindona backfired, when he was held to account for an insufficient background investigation, before he sold the stock to Sindona. Coincidentally, the new relations with China on Nixon's part was scene as a threat to Sindona's business with his clients in Europe. This might have been interpreted as a disloyal gesture on Nixon's part, by his European supporters. The additional coincidence of the Watergate break-in, a hotel owned by Sindona and the Vatican, may have been partially motivated by Nixon's paranoia about the backlash of his European supporters, and how the Democratic headquarters break-in could yield information. Foiling the break-in could have been the plan to have revenge. Management of Franklin, led by Gleason and Sindona engaged in a massive real estate expansion, fraudulent statement of financial assets, foreign currency activities, and mismanagement that ultimately led to the bank's demise on October 8, 1974. When the end was near Sindona sent large sums of money overseas to recover his investment, and the bank then had insufficient capital to operate. At the time it was the largest bank failure in the history of the United States. The bank's assets and deposits were then purchased out of the receivership by European-American Bank & Trust Company. Roth, along with his son Donald, later went on to develop the Bank of Suffolk County, in Stony Brook, New York.

Founding Neu Samara was formed by Mennonite settlers of German language, culture and ancestry in 1891-92 who came from the Molotschna mother colony on the Sea of Azov in Ukraine. Initially twelve villages were founded: Kamenetz, Pleschanowo, Krassikowo, Kaltan, Lugowsk, Podolsk, Donskoj, Dolinsk, Jugowka, Klinok, Kuterlja, Bogomasowo. About 500 families totaling 2600 individuals made up the initial settlement. Later three additional villages were formed: Annenskoje, Wladimirowka und Ischalka. In the 1950s Annenskoje, Kamenetz und Wladimirowka were dissolved. In spite of the initial economic difficulties, the colony was prospering by the beginning of World War I. By 1917 there were 14 villages and nine estates with a total of 32,600 ha (80,600 acres) and a population of 3670. A Mennonite congregation was formed in 1891 at Pleschanowo, which had 1034 baptized members in 1905, along with another 2689 unbaptized attendees. Elder Daniel Boschmann led the congregation. The Mennonite Brethren congregation in Lugowsk built a very beautiful church building in 1901 that is now used as government administrative offices. Abraham Martens was elder of this congregation. An Alliance Church In Donskoj later became a Mennonite Brethren congregation. Civil war and famine Neu Samara came through the Russian Civil War with relatively little suffering. Along with all of Russia, Neu Samara suffered through the Russian famine of 1921. They received food aid from North American Mennonites through the American Mennonite Relief program. A key organizer of this relief effort was Canadian Cornelius F. Klassen who grew up in Neu Samara. The easing political and economic conditions of the 1920s permitted a wave of around 700 people to immigrate to Canada and Paraguay. The basis for the immigration lay in increasing religious repression and economic stagnation. Religious persecution Religious persecution increased considerably in 1931-32 when all churches were closed. The Germans of Neu Samara endured more suffering through the collectivization and dekulakization programs. Herds of cattle died mainly because of the lack of supplies and feed. In early 1931 land was tilled using cows as draft animals. World War II The most difficult period came with World War II. Neu Samara was not purged to the extent of other German settlements, but almost the whole adult population was evicted to forced labor camps. The remaining villagers needed to replace the absent workers, leaving much of the work to 13- and 14-year-old children. Many never returned from the labor camps after the war. Krasnogwardejskij District In spite of the economic difficulties the situation of the residents gradually improved. On 1 January 1967 Neu-Samara became part of the newly formed Krasnogwardejskij District (previously Neu-Samara belonged to the Sorotschinsker District). The district's administrative center is Pleschanowo. Pleschanowo and nearby Donskoj have grown significantly since 1967, and include many non-Germans. Other villages have also increased in population. Podolsk und Lugowsk have grown into a single town. Most villages now have more than the original central street. Collective farms and prosperity The economy of Neu Samara has been based on collective farming since collectivization of private property. After a few years with only one collective farm for the whole settlement, each village formed its own collective. In the 1950s there was another expansion of collective farms. In the end, all of the German villages except Ischalka divided into one of three collectives: \\"Komsomolez\\" centered in Bogomasowo, \\"Karl Marx\\" centered in Podolsk and \\"Saweti Lenina\\" centered in Pleschanowo. A great part of the income came from the villagers' own ¬º and later ¬Ω ha (0.6, later 1.2 acre) parcels, which they could manage themselves and sell the surplus at the market. This extra income allowed them to purchase automobiles and motorbikes. Religious tolerance Religious persecution eased for a short time after World War II. Baptisms and church service could be performed during that time. Another atheism campaign started at the end of the 1950s. A gradual loosening of this policy didn't occur until the 1970s. Congregations were formed again during this time, most of which registered as Baptist churches. The leadership at this time included elder Daniel Janzen of Donskoj. Immigration The second greatest wave of immigration has happened since 1998. In 1990 there were 7434 residents of German background in Neu Samara. By the end of the 1990s almost all of these Germans had moved to Germany. Today almost no one of German heritage lives in these villages.

One of the most striking characteristics of the life and works of MOP is the award-winning Caribbean- style Christian music that they produce. Most songs are written by Father Ho Lung and performed by Father Ho Lung & Friends. The music generates revenue for the mission. The brothers and sisters, who give away all personal belongings, take vows of poverty, chastity, obedience and free service to the least of our brothers and sisters. Everything is done in community including praying, eating, sleeping, and traveling. All their daily activities revolve around prayer, service and worship. More than just giving aid with food, clothing and shelter, the Missionaries of the Poor are dedicated to building up the Church and spreading the Faith. Dedicated to the Holy Rosary, they wear the beads on their sashes, and it was on the feast of the Holy Rosary in 1997 that the Holy See recognized them as religious community.Vatican Approval 1997 - Missionaries of the Poor In November, 2014, the Vatican elevated the MOP to an Institute of Pontifical Right.

Today the local economy thrives on the hundreds of small family-owned and operated clothing fabricators, with the result that clothing exports now exceeds the traditional 'Big Three' of coffee, sugar and bananas. One result of the Civil War was the mass-emigration of Indigenous Maya to the United States and a massive influx of 'remesas' (electronic remittances) to their families, with the result that for several years, over 50% of the country's economy was cash remittances to the Indigenous Maya. Since people of purer Spanish descent were less likely to emigrate and receive refugee status, the balance of economical and political power has sharply shifted from Spanish domination to increased opportunities for the industrious Maya. This can be seen from the bustling textile market days that fill the entire urban area of San Francisco El Alto, making it a favorite tourist destination. Transportation has also improved as flotillas of tricycle taxis (tuk-tuks) and passenger vans (micros) provide services to any location in the area. While the Maya remain suspicious of anyone from outside small rural communities, they are interested in foreign contacts and often invite travelers into their homes and festivals. Since 1900, the Chivarreto boxing tournament has been held at the municipality.

While \\"FDFD\\" is a generic term describing all frequency-domain finite-difference methods, the title seems to mostly describe the method as applied to scattering problems. The method shares many similarities to the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, so much of the literature on FDTD can be directly applied. The method works by transforming Maxwell's equations (or other partial differential equation) for sources and fields at a constant frequency into matrix form Ax = b. The matrix A is derived from the wave equation operator, the column vector x contains the field components, and the column vector b describes the source. The method is capable of incorporating anisotropic materials, but off-diagonal components of the tensor require special treatment. Strictly speaking, there are at least two categories of \\"frequency-domain\\" problems in electromagnetism. One is to find the response to a current density J with a constant frequency œâ, i.e. of the form \\\\mathbf{J}(\\\\mathbf{x}) e^{i\\\\omega t}, or a similar time-harmonic source. This frequency-domain response problem leads to an Ax = b system of linear equations as described above. An early description of a frequency- domain response FDTD method to solve scattering problems was published by Christ and Hartnagel (1987). Another is to find the normal modes of a structure (e.g. a waveguide) in the absence of sources: in this case the frequency œâ is itself a variable, and one obtains an eigenproblem Ax = \\\\lambda x (usually, the eigenvalue Œª is œâ2). An early description of an FDTD method to solve electromagnetic eigenproblems was published by Albani and Bernardi (1974). Implementing the method #Use a Yee grid because it offers the following benefits: (1) it implicitly satisfies the zero divergence conditions to avoid spurious solutions, (2) it naturally handles physical boundary conditions, and (3) it provides a very elegant and compact way of approximating the curl equations with finite-differences. #Much of the literature on finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods applies to FDFD, particularly topics on how to represent materials and devices on a Yee grid. Comparison with FDTD and FEM The FDFD method is very similar to the FDTD method, though there are some major differences. Unlike the FDTD method, there are no time steps that must be computed sequentially, thus making FDFD easier to implement. This might also lead one to imagine that FDFD is less computationally expensive; however, this is not necessarily the case. The FDFD method requires solving a sparse matrix, which even for simple problems can be 20,000 by 20,000 elements or larger, with over a million unknowns. In this respect, the FDFD method is similar to the finite element method, which is a finite integral method and is also usually implemented in the frequency domain. There are efficient numerical solvers available so that matrix inversion‚Äîan extremely computationally expensive process‚Äîcan be avoided. Additionally, model order reduction techniques can be employed to reduce problem size. FDFD, and FDTD for that matter, does not lend itself well to complex geometries or multiscale structures, as the Yee grid is restricted mostly to rectangular structures. This can be circumvented by either using a very fine grid mesh (which increases computational cost), or by approximating the effects with surface boundary conditions. Non uniform gridding can lead to spurious charges at the interface boundary, as the zero divergence conditions are not maintained when the grid is not uniform along an interface boundary. E and H field continuity can be maintained to circumvent this problem by enforcing weak continuity across the interface using basis functions, as is done in FEM. Perfectly matched layer (PML) boundary conditions can also be used to truncate the grid, and avoid meshing empty space. Susceptance element equivalent circuit The FDFD equations can be rearranged in such a way as to describe a second order equivalent circuit, where nodal voltages represent the E field components and branch currents represent the H field components. This equivalent circuit representation can be extremely useful, as techniques from circuit theory can be used to analyze or simplify the problem and can be used as a spice-like tool for three-dimensional electromagnetic simulation. This susceptance element equivalent circuit (SEEC) model has the advantages of a reduced number of unknowns, only having to solve for E field components, and second order model order reduction techniques can be employed. Applications The FDFD method has been used to provide full wave simulation for modeling interconnects for various applications in electronic packaging. FDFD has also been used for various scattering problems at optical frequencies.

Although she has often been nicknamed Lucy's baby, the specimen has been dated at 3.3 million years ago, approximately 120,000 years older than \\"Lucy\\" (dated to about 3.18 mya).  Discovery  The fossils were discovered by Zeresenay Alemseged, and are remarkable for both their age and condition. On 20 September 2006 the journal Nature presented the findings of a dig in Dikika, Ethiopia, a few miles south of Hadar, the well-known site where the fossil hominin known as Lucy was found. The recovered skeleton comprises almost the entire skull and torso and many parts of the limbs. The features of the skeleton suggest adaptation to walking upright (bipedalism) as well as tree- climbing, features that correspond well with the skeletal features of Lucy and other specimens of Australopithecus afarensis from Ethiopia and Tanzania. CT- scans of the skull show small canine teeth forming, indicating the specimen is female. \\"Lucy's Baby\\" has officially been named \\"Selam\\" (meaning \\"peace\\"). The name was published at the announcement of the discovery at the National Museum in Addis Ababa. As part of Ethiopia's Millennium celebration a commemorative gold coin was minted and given to visiting government officials during the celebration year. Following is an abstract of the original article describing the baby \\"Selam\\", which was authored by Zeresenay Alemseged, Fred Spoor, William H. Kimbel, Ren√© Bobe, Denis Geraads, Denn√© Reed and Jonathan G. Wynn. Nota bene: brackets { } added. A life like image of Selam was published on the front page of the November 2006 issue of National Geographic. Evolution  Many paleoanthropologists propose that the Homo line derives from A. africanus; in this view it might be better to place Selam in the A. africanus line, since it has more human traits than most A. afarensis (see Homininae).  Implications  Examination of the shoulder blade and arms of this specimen has lent support to the idea that Australopithecus afarensis climbed extensively.

After being mustered out at the end of the American Civil War, he moved to Arkansas. He participated in the Land Run of 1889 in what would become Oklahoma Territory, and settled in Norman where he became a banker and an American businessman. President Grover Cleveland appointed him to serve as the 3rd Governor of Oklahoma Territory from 1893 to 1897. After completing his term of office, he moved to Miami, Oklahoma, where he became active in lead and zinc mining business. He followed this activity by entering the oil and gas business in Texas, which proved quite profitable. He died in Arkansas in 1922 while traveling to see his brother. Early life and military service The third territorial governor was born at Smithfield, North Carolina on March 15, 1845. He attended the public schools which he left at the age of 17 years to enter the Confederate States Army in the American Civil War, and on February 25, 1862, enlisted in Company C, 50th North Carolina Infantry Regiment at Smithfield and was mustered into service at Camp Mangum on April 21, 1862, as a sergeant but subsequently was promoted to first sergeant. Robert Darius Lunsford was captain of Company C and Marshall D. Craton was the colonel of the 50th regiment at the time of his enlistment. The last muster rolls of his company available show that for July and August, 1864 young Renfrow was being present. Business and political career After his return from the war, Renfrow removed from North Carolina to the vicinity of Russellville, Arkansas where in 1865 he married Jennie B. York of Judsonia, Arkansas on October 17, 1875. He functioned as a deputy county official at Russellville in the 1880s. Upon the opening of Oklahoma for settlement in 1889, he located at Norman, Oklahoma where he was engaged in the banking business in association with T. M. Richardson of Oklahoma City. President Grover Cleveland appointed Renfrow as governor of Oklahoma Territory and on May 7, 1893 the oath of office was administered to him at Guthrie. It has been reported that although Renfrow was relatively unknown in Oklahoma Territory, President Cleveland was set on appointing him because of his success in finance and his clean reputation.Johnson, Todd and Durwood Barbour. Johnston County. 1997. Arcadia Publishing Co. Charleston, SC. p. 119. Accessed September 2, 2019. He was a Democrat, being the only governor from that party during the territorial period. The outstanding event of his administration was the opening of the Cherokee Outlet on September 16, 1893. During his tenure, the U.S. Supreme Court transferred most of Greer County, Texas to Oklahoma in 1896, the Oklahoma Historical Society was formed and on February 21, 1895, Renfrow approved an act constituting that society as trustee for Oklahoma Territory. He was succeeded by Cassius M. Barnes, who entered office on May 24, 1897. Later life After his retirement from office, Renfrow lived in Kansas City, Missouri for a few years, but later becoming engaged in the lead and zinc business in northeastern Oklahoma removed to Miami, Oklahoma, where he operated his mining business under the Renfrow Mining and Royalty Company and became an extensive owner of lead and zinc properties. Some two years prior to his death he embarked in the oil and gas business in the Mexia field in Texas where he spent a considerable portion of his time. His business ventures were highly successful. Renfrow died while sitting in the lobby of the Massey Hotel at Bentonville, Arkansas on January 31, 1922, while en route from Miami to Russellville on account of the illness of his brother. His is buried in the cemetery at Russellville by the side of his wife who died some years before.

It was the tallest building in the city as well as the greater Lehigh Valley‚Äî taller than the PPL Building in Allentown. Martin Tower was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 28, 2010. Originally built as the headquarters of now-defunct Bethlehem Steel, the building, which once dominated the city's skyline when completed in 1972, stood vacant from 2007 until its eventual demolition on May 19, 2019 at 7:03 AM EDT. History Begun in 1969, the framework of the Tower was completed in a short time. The building was completed and opened in 1972. The skyscraper was named after then-Bethlehem Steel chairman Edmund F. Martin. Bethlehem Steel spared no expense in their new skyscraper headquarters. The building was built in the shape of a cross (or plus-sign) rather than a more conventional square, in order to create more corner- and window-offices. The architect for Martin Tower was Haines Lundberg Waehler. It was built by George A. Fuller Construction Co. of New York, which also built the Flat Iron Building in New York in 1903, the CBS Building in New York in 1963 and 1251 Avenue of the Americas at Rockefeller Center in 1971. Under the initial plan, Bethlehem Steel was to build a second Tower, which is why some people refer to it as \\"Martin Towers.\\" An Annex was built, intended to connect the two Towers, but the second Tower was never built. The original offices were designed by decorators from New York and included wooden furniture, doorknobs with the company logo, and handwoven carpets. The building was a testament to the economic heights the Lehigh Valley reached in the 1970s before the large economic downturn caused by the decline of the steel industry. The building was a symbol of Bethlehem Steel's power, money and dominance in the steel industry. The building had 21 floors, and each floor housed a different department of the company. When Martin Tower was opened, Bethlehem Steel was the second largest steel producer in the world and the 14th largest industrial corporation in America. In 1973, the first full year the Tower was occupied, Bethlehem Steel set a company record, producing 22.3 million tons of raw steel and shipping 16.3 million tons of finished steel. It made a $207 million profit that year, and exceeded that the following year. By 1987, a shrinking white-collar work force had the Tower sitting almost completely vacant; it was then put up for sale and other companies occupied the Tower and its annex. In 2001, Bethlehem Steel filed for bankruptcy and officially left Martin Tower in 2003. Several companies remained until the last tenant, Receivable Management Services, departed in 2007, leaving it completely vacant.  Vacancy and demolition  In 2007, the entire building became vacant, although surface parking around the building continued in use as park-and-ride lots for local festivals. Proposals to convert the building to condominiums or apartments, along with recreational and retail space on the property, proved unfeasible due to the presence of asbestos and the cost of its removal along with the housing market crash. The City of Bethlehem subsequently applied for CRIZ (City Revitalization and Improvement Zone) designation, winning one of the two CRIZ designations on December 30, 2013. Restoration of the building, including the removal of asbestos and addition of a sprinkler system, was envisioned by the third year of the CRIZ, with renovations beginning in 2016. In July 2015, Bethlehem Mayor Robert Donchez announced plans to rezone the Martin Tower property. The zoning at that time had allowed mostly residential in and around the building, while protecting the building from being razed. After many public hearings and votes, the Martin Tower property was approved on December 15, 2015, for mixed-use rezoning to allow more retail space on the property. The decision also permitted demolition of Martin Tower at the owner/developer's discretion. The public had many concerns about the new rezoning. Some feared it would make it easier to remove the building. Others feared it would create a third downtown in the city and create competition to business owners. City Council passed the zoning despite the concerns of a few members of the public. On January 13, 2017, almost 10 years since the building was vacated, owners Ronca and Herrick announced removal of asbestos from the building and annex would begin, regardless of whether the Tower was ultimately renovated for adaptive reuse or demolished. In January 2019, the owners announced their redevelopment master plan would include demolition of the Tower. Martin Tower was imploded by Controlled Demolition, Inc., on May 19, 2019, at a reported cost of $575,000. Demolition officials said it was a \\"textbook implosion\\". The entire building, consisting of 6,500 square feet of concrete and 16,000 tons of steel, came down in only 16 seconds. Nearby roads and highways were open soon after it came down.

It stars William Sylvester and Yvonne Romain. Plot Hypnotist/magician \\"The Great Vorelli\\" (Bryant Haliday) and his dummy Hugo perform before a packed audience in London. The audience observes tension between the ventriloquist and his dummy. American reporter Mark English (William Sylvester) becomes fascinated with Vorelli, and solicits his girlfriend Marianne Horn (Yvonne Romain) to go with him to another show. From the beginning, the film drops strong hints that Hugo is actually alive and mobile. At the following show, Vorelli asks a member of his audience onto the stage. When no one volunteers, English encourages Marianne to go up. Vorelli succeeds in hypnotizing her and making her dance the Twist with an uncredited Ray Landor, an \\"expert in modern dance\\". Marianne is left partially hypnotized by Vorelli, who recognizes her as a wealthy heiress. English, wanting to do a story on Vorelli and his unique powers, gets Marianne to invite Vorelli to her aunt's charity ball. Vorelli has already decided to go to the ball, having read about it in the newspaper and seeing it as an opportunity to seduce Marianne. The night of the ball, Vorelli stays at the mansion of Marianne's aunt, where he seduces her after using his power to subdue her will. In the meantime, Hugo miraculously appears in English's room and asks him for help. Hugo repeats \\"1948\\" and \\"Berlin\\" before disappearing. The next day, English begins an investigation into Vorelli's past. Meanwhile, Marianne falls into a semi-coma that the doctors cannot alleviate. In one lucid moment, she tells English that, \\"He keeps calling me\\" and, \\"Make him stop\\". Through a colleague, English discovers that Vorelli had once been a disgraced medical doctor who dabbled in Eastern magic. The colleague traces Vorelli to Berlin and guides English to a former female assistant of Vorelli's who lives there. She tells English that another assistant, \\"Hugo\\", had worked for Vorelli in 1947, and would be hypnotized into a state where he could not feel pain as part of their act. The female assistant says that she would catch the two in strange conferences. One night, Vorelli killed Hugo on stage and simultaneously transferred his soul into the dummy. Vorelli was cleared in the death, and no one believed the female assistant's story. Vorelli's current assistant, who is also his lover, becomes jealous of his relationship with Marianne. Vorelli either manipulates or taunts Hugo into murdering his lover/assistant when Vorelli is visiting with stage crew elsewhere. Vorelli then hires a new, younger assistant whom he also puts under his physical and sexual control. During English's trip to Berlin, Vorelli visits the still-hypnotized Marianne in her home and tells her to announce that she is going to marry him. Vorelli confides to Hugo that he plans to marry Marianne in Spain and transfer her spirit into a companion doll for Hugo before letting her body die. Hugo escapes from his cage, smashes the face of the female doll intended for Marianne, and attacks Vorelli. Vorelli seemingly succeeds in wrestling the irate Hugo back into his cage just as English enters the room. \\"Vorelli\\" speaks in Hugo's voice and tells English that Hugo has now transferred his soul into Vorelli's body and vice versa. From Hugo's former body, Vorelli begs for help from English, who does not respond as the film ends. Production Frederick E.

His technique is still used to this day. Career Allen was born in Maywood, Illinoison April 1, 1910. He attended Stanford University, receiving a Bachelor of Arts in engineering in 1932 and an Aeronautical Engineer professional degree in 1935. In 1936, he joined the NACA's Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory. In 1940, he moved to the Ames Research Laboratory, where he served as Chief of the Ames Theoretical Aerodynamics Branch (starting in 1941), Chief of the High-Speed Research Division (starting in 1945), Assistant Director for Astronautics (starting in 1959), and finally Center Director (1965-1969). Research Allen was interested in the full range of aerodynamics research, and made contributions to the study of subsonic, transonic, supersonic and hypersonic flow. When the United States became interested in the design of ballistic missiles, Allen began research in the dynamics and thermodynamics of atmospheric reentry, as well as the effects of radiation and meteorites on space vehicles. His most significant contribution in this area was the idea of using a blunt nose for reentry vehicles, otherwise known as his \\"Blunt Body Theory\\". Earlier ballistic missiles, developed by both the United States and the Soviet Union, featured long nose cones with very narrow tips, which had relatively low drag when entering the atmosphere at high speeds. However, Allen demonstrated that a blunt body, although it had greater drag, would have a detached shock wave which would transfer far less heat to the vehicle than the traditional shape with its attached shock wave. Excessive heating was the greatest concern in the design of ballistic missiles and spacecraft, since it could melt their surface; the blunt body design solved this problem. Allen's theory led to the design of ablative heat shields that protected the astronauts of the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs as their space capsules re-entered the atmosphere.

The game design is by J.C. Connors and Ben Knight. Monsters Menace America is a redevelopment of Monsters Ravage America, a game published by Avalon Hill shortly before they were acquired by Hasbro in 1998. This new edition streamlined some rules and drastically improved the aesthetics of the game by adding plastic monsters and military units. Like the original version, players are B-Movie monsters who rampage across America, destroying cities, mutating at radioactive sites, and stomping on military bases and famous landmarks. In addition to the monsters, each player also controls a branch of the U.S. armed forces with which they can attack other players. The game ends with a final fight called the \\"Monster Challenge\\" where all the surviving monsters fight it out to determine the king. The six monsters included in the game are Gargantis, Konk, Megaclaw, Tomanagi, Toxicor, and Zorb. Each of these represents a famous B-Movie archetype and possesses a special ability that distinguishes it from its fellow monsters. These abilities range from Konk's expertise at smashing fighter jets to Tomanagi's prowess in sea-based combat.

In 1339, he was present fighting the Angevins then trying to conquer Lipari. Taken captive, he was freed in November 1340 through the interference of a Sienese widow, Camiola Turinga, a woman he promised to marry. He never did and was considered highly ungrateful by contemporaries, including Boccaccio. From 1343 to 1345, he was governor of Palermo and in 1345, strategos of Messina. He supported the duke of Randazzo as regent during the reign of Louis and then supported his sister-in-law Elisabeth of Carinthia after the duke's death. He was sent as an ambassador to Sardinia on behalf of Peter IV of Aragon in 1353. He continued to help Elisabeth into the reign of his other nephew Frederick the Simple. He was a soldier and a general during the last wars between the houses of Barcelona and Anjou for possession of Trinacria. He distinguished himself in the Battle of Aci and in defending Messina from the Angevins. In 1358, he reconquered the area from Vizzini to Avola.

The foundation of the organization was laid when Heather Booth helped her friend's sister obtain a safe abortion in 1965. Other women with unwanted pregnancies began to contact Booth after learning via word-of-mouth that she could help them. When the workload became more than what she could manage, she reached out to other activists in the women's liberation movement. The collective sought to address the increasing number of unsafe abortions being performed by untrained providers. Since illegal abortions were not only dangerous but very expensive, the founding members of the collective believed that they could provide women with safer and more affordable access to abortions. Initially, the organization directed the women to male doctors. After a few years, however, they learned that one of their most-used doctors had lied about having medical credentials. This created a conflict in the group, causing some members to leave. Others realized that if a man without medical credentials could perform a safe abortion, then they could learn as well. A few of their number learned how to perform surgical abortions, with the dilation and curettage method most commonly used. Members of the group performed an estimated 11,000 abortions, mostly to low-income women who could not afford to travel to the places where abortion was legal, as well as women of color. In 1972, one of the Jane Collective apartments was raided by the police, and seven of its members were arrested. Each was charged with eleven counts of abortion and conspiracy to commit abortion, carrying a maximum prison sentence of 110 years. Their attorney was able to delay court proceedings in anticipation of the Supreme Court's decision on Roe v. Wade. As the attorney hoped, the Court's decision in Roe in 1973 struck down many abortion restrictions in the US, and the charges against the Jane Collective members were dropped. As women now had access to legal abortion, the Collective disbanded shortly afterwards. While their abortions sometimes resulted in complications, none of their clients were known to die from their abortions. Historical context By the mid-1800s, abortion was illegal in almost every US state. In the state of Illinois, at the time the Jane Collective formed, abortion was considered felony homicide. However, in the 1960s, it was estimated that a third of US women who wanted no more children would have at least one unintended pregnancy by the end of their childbearing years. In the 1950s and 1960s, it was estimated that 200,000-1.2 million illegal abortions occurred annually. Women sometimes died as a result of these procedures, accounting for 17% of all deaths attributed to childbirth and pregnancy in 1965. Low-income women had relatively high rates of obtaining illegal abortions, at 8% of those surveyed in New York City, with the majority attempting a self-induced abortion and only 2% involving physicians. In New York City, non-white and Puerto Rican women were more at risk from illegal abortions: abortion accounted for half of all their pregnancy-related deaths, in contrast to 25% of pregnancy-related deaths for white women. Nationwide, the abortion-related mortality rate for non-white women was twelve times greater than that of white women from 1972-1974. Abortion remained illegal in each state until Colorado was the first to decriminalize abortion in some circumstances in 1967. In 1970, four states--Washington, New York, Hawaii, and Alaska--repealed laws against abortion, making it generally legal before the age of viability. Traveling to obtain legal abortion became easier for the affluent, as they no longer had to travel to destinations such as the United Kingdom. Traveling to obtain an abortion was cost prohibitive for those who could not afford the procedure, let alone travel and lodging expenses. For those who could procure an illegal abortion, results were mixed. Some women experienced hemorrhaging or sepsis. Others paid for abortions only to still be pregnant afterwards from a botched procedure.  Origins  Heather Booth, the founder of the Jane Collective In 1965, University of Chicago student Heather Booth learned that her friend's sister had an unwanted pregnancy that left her distraught and nearly suicidal. Booth had previously not given much thought to abortion access; her exposure to the experience of an unwanted pregnancy led her to consider abortion restrictions as unjust laws, saying, \\"in the face of an unjust law, you need to take action to challenge it\\". To seek assistance for her friend's sister, Booth contacted the Medical Committee for Human Rights, who connected her with civil rights leader and surgeon T. R. M. Howard. Howard worked at the Friendship Medical Center in Chicago, and Booth sent her friend to his facility. Word spread that Booth was able to help women obtain safe abortions, and she soon began receiving calls from other women. Operating under the pseudonym \\"Jane\\", Booth began taking such phone calls at her college dormitory, referring more clients to Howard, who performed the abortions for $500. Booth later switched to an abortionist alternately referred to as \\"Mike\\" or \\"Nick\\". Location of Hyde Park, Chicago, where the Jane Collective was founded Booth continued to refer patients for abortions, averaging one per week, mostly for low-income women and women of color. This continued until 1968 when she was out of college, married, pregnant, and employed full-time. With less time to devote to connecting women with abortion providers, she recruited and trained ten other women to help her. She transferred her leadership role to Ruth Surgal and Jody Parsons. The organization, founded in Hyde Park, Chicago, adopted the name Abortion Counseling Service of Women's Liberation, proclaiming that they were for \\"every woman having exactly as many children as she wants, when she wants, if she wants.\\" They decided that the name was wordy, though; women who called should ask for \\"Jane\\", which they considered the \\"everywoman name\\". The Abortion Counseling Service of Women's Liberation was a work group of the Chicago Women's Liberation Union. One member of the Jane Collective was known as \\"Jenny\\". She was motivated to help provide abortion access by her past struggles to obtain a safe abortion. Jenny discovered that she was pregnant shortly after she was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. She sought an abortion due to concerns about the effects of her radiation treatment on the fetus, but was denied by the hospital board. After informing two psychiatrists that she intended to kill herself if not allowed an abortion, she was allowed her request. Organization structure and services The services of the Jane Collective spread through word of mouth. The organization also reached women through posting signs in the city that read, \\"Pregnant? Don't want to be? Call Jane\\", listing the phone number. They placed ads in underground newspapers saying, \\"Pregnant? Worried? Call Jane.\\" The number directed the caller to an answering machine, where they were instructed to leave their name, phone number, and date of their last period. The woman would then be contacted by a member of the Collective, who would schedule a meeting to discuss the procedure. The Jane Collective had patients referred to them by medical professionals, which annoyed them, as the doctors were almost always unwilling to provide any assistance. If the woman decided to proceed with the abortion, she was given the address of \\"The Front\\". \\"The Front\\" was one of the many apartments that the Collective rented throughout the city. Before the abortion, the patient and a member of Jane would meet at The Front, where the patient would then be driven to a second location to undergo the abortion. \\"Jenny\\", one of the members, eventually began demanding to be in the room with the patients while the procedure was performed to ensure that the women were treated well. Jenny was highly critical of how her health was managed by men when she was pregnant with cancer, saying \\"Through that whole experience, there wasn't one woman involved. It was men ‚Äî the doctors, the hospital board ‚Äî controlling my reproductive rights and condemning me to death.\\" Jenny learned about providing abortions by watching \\"Nick\\", who eventually trained her as his nurse. Abortions remained cost-prohibitive for their clients, who were generally low-income. Even after guaranteeing some abortionists ten clients per week, the per-abortion cost remained $500. Members of the Collective used fundraising to help cover the costs of the procedure for those who couldn't afford it. In 1971, however, the Collective discovered that \\"Nick\\" was not actually a doctor, as he had claimed. This caused emotional duress for some members of the Collective, who insisted that using an abortionist with fake credentials made them \\"just like the back-alleys\\", and that they should shutter the organization. Up to half of the group's members left after learning that their abortionist was not an actual doctor. He was performing up to twenty abortions a day with skill, however, and other members realized: \\"If he can do it, then we can do it, too.\\" As Jenny learned to perform the procedure, she was able to teach other members. It remained a limited skill, however, with only about four members trained to perform surgical abortions. Members took over performing abortions, which enabled them to drop the price from $500‚Äì600 to $100. However, they accepted whatever amount a client was able to pay. The Jane Collective learned how to perform pap smears and found a laboratory to read the results for $4. The drop in prices resulted in more low-income clients, as well as more black clients. One black woman, Lois, criticized the group when she came to them for an abortion for their lack of diversity, as they were nearly all white and middle-class. She stated, \\"You guys are the white angels that are going to save everybody and where are the black women at?\\" Lois decided to join the Collective to help counsel its black patients. Seeking an abortion could be especially difficult for black women, as some black nationalists decried that abortion was an agent of black genocide. The women learned several abortion methods, such as the cannula method for early stage abortions, and the super coil method used in later stage abortions which caused the women to miscarry, but the most widely used was the D&C; (dilation and curettage) method.  Legal issues and dissolution  It was rumored that the police intentionally turned a blind eye to the Collective's illegal activities, possibly because unwanted pregnancies and resulting abortions also occurred in their families. Some of their clients were from such families, or were even policewomen themselves. One of the women who was trained to perform abortions noted, \\"Neither the Chicago Police nor the Outfit/Mafia had previously bothered us though each knew of our work: we were clean, damn good, and made too little money to interest them.\\" P. B. Bart noted that \\"unlike other illegal abortionists, Jane did not leave bleeding bodies in motels for the police to deal with\\", which could explain the years of inaction of the Chicago police regarding the Collective's activities. In 1972, two Catholic women went to the police to report that their sister-in-law was planning on having an abortion. Two police officers arrived at one of the Collective's apartments on 3 May and asked, \\"where's the doctor?\\", looking for a male practitioner. Seven of the women working for Jane were arrested and charged with eleven counts of abortion and conspiracy to commit abortion. They became known as the \\"Abortion 7\\". While in the police van, one woman removed a stack of index cards from her purse that had the contact information of their patients. They ripped the names and addresses off of the index cards and swallowed them to protect the information. Each woman faced up to a maximum of a 110-year prison sentence, with 1-10 years possible on each count. Jeanne Galatzer-Levy, one of the women arrested, recalled that she felt that the police treated them, the abortionists, better than their patients. She stated, \\"...there were all kinds of class and race things going on with the police. They felt more like us than like the women they were supposedly protecting from us, and they kinda wanted that relationship. So that was bizarre, just bizarre.\\" The 7 were soon released on bail. The 7 hired an attorney, Jo-Anne Wolfson. Wolfson \\"really wanted the case, because she was a woman and she thought a woman should handle the case\\". She pursued a legal strategy of delaying the court proceedings as long as possible. It was known that the Supreme Court was currently deciding the Roe v. Wade case: a favorable ruling would make it easier for Wolfson to have the charges dismissed or obtain a more favorable plea deal. In 1973, Roe v. Wade was decided, which struck down many abortion restrictions. All of the charges against the Abortion 7 were dismissed; additionally, they were not charged with practicing without a license in exchange for not requesting the return of their medical instruments. After abortion was legalized, the Jane Collective disbanded. One doctor offered the Jane Collective abortionists a job at her office performing abortions, but was then dissuaded by her lawyer. Several members were critical of the Roe v. Wade decision, with Laura Kaplan saying it was \\"written emphatically in terms of physician‚Äôs rights, not women‚Äôs rights\\". In her eyes, illegal abortion with women helping women was supplanted by a process in which men would be in charge of women's bodies once again. Linnea Johnson said, \\"what we did was to remand women back into the realm of male law, male custom, medical custody. Bad idea then as now.\\" The women, who were burned-out with their mission and each other, according to Kaplan, had an \\"end-of-Jane party\\" after the first legal abortion clinics opened in the spring of 1973. They then went their separate ways. Martha Scott was later employed at a woman's health center and remained an activist for women's rights. Outcomes and legacy In the seven years that the group existed, they performed an estimated 11,000 abortions. There were no reports of abortion-related death as a result of their work, though one member, Martha Scott, recalled that some of their patients ended up having to go to the emergency room afterwards, while others had to undergo hysterectomies. One obstetrician who provided follow-up visits for the Collective's patients stated that their safety rate was comparable to legally operating clinics in New York. The story of the Jane Collective has been called a \\"motivational call to arms\\". Haven Coalition, a non-profit in New York City that helps out-of-town women access abortions in the city, draws inspiration from the Jane Collective for their operations. Though abortion remains legal in the US, it has become increasingly restricted: By 2018, more than 1,100 abortion restrictions had been passed in the US, and the number of abortion clinics declined by nearly half since the late 1970s. A volunteer with the Haven Coalition stated, \\"There‚Äôs an effort to sort of preserve the vestiges of what used to be an underground railroad and something that might be again\\", alluding to the possibility that abortion could become illegal in the US once again. The Jane Collective has also been cited as inspiration to a loose network of American women who provide illegal abortions.

This claim is based on the club being a spin-off from Sydney University Football Club, Australia's oldest rugby union club, which experimented with Australian rules in its early years. SUANFC did not play its first official game until 1887. Sydney University currently fields seven teams: NEAFL (Seniors), Premier (Reserves), Division 1 (Blues), Division 2 (Reds), Division 4 (Golds), Division 5 (Platinums) and Under 19 Premier Division (Colts). History The Students have participated in Sydney football's elite competition for a total of 37 seasons (as at the end of 2019) in four separate stints. In the 10 seasons from 1948 to 1957, the side managed four \\"wooden spoons\\" and two second last finishes, with seventh place out of 10 clubs in 1954 . The next stint in the top flight was between 1962 and 1968, and then reserve grade only in 1969-70. Then there was involvement in the Sydney District Football Association (the word \\"District\\" was later dropped from the title) between 1971 and 1987. In the competition's inaugural season, the side contested an \\"all student\\" grand final against the University of New South Wales, but despite managing the same number of scoring shots as the opposition, they went under by 25 points. Another grand final appearance against the same adversaries in 1977 brought a similar result. Sydney University's first SFA premiership arrived in 1981 after a 10.14 (74) to 9.12 (68) grand final defeat of St Ives, but the following year brought disappointment with a 42-point defeat at the hands of the same opponents. After consecutive flags in 1986 (a 16-point defeat of Manly-Warringah) and 1987 (by 62 points over Bankstown Sports) the side was ready for a 3rd stint at the SFL. After a wooden spoon in 1988, the students began to make steady progress. By 1992, under the expert guidance of former Sydney Swans stalwart Rod Carter, the Students were ready to take a serious tilt at the flag, and after finishing as minor premiers they qualified to meet reigning premiers North Shore in the premiership decider and won by 65 points. Final scores were Sydney University 18.16 (124) to North Shore 8.11 (59. After dropping to 5th in 1993, the side moved to 8th position (out of 10) in 1994, before returning to the SFA. After taking a couple of season to find their feet, the Students contested every grand final bar one between 1997 and 2001, although they were only ultimately able to secure 2 premierships. In 2007, the Students were re-admitted to the top flight of the Sydney AFL after an absence of 12 years. Under coach Daniel Archer, the club finished with a respectable five wins to finish in eighth spot on the ladder. The club was to take bigger strides in 2008, just missing out on a finals berth on the last day of the season after a loss to North Shore. The 2009 season saw a change of coach ‚Äì Roger Moten who had coached local rival UTS to premiership success was installed, as was a new captain in Mark Egan. Again, the Students fell agonisingly short of a finals berth after a string of close losses throughout the season, however there was success at an individual level for two players with Tom Young winning the Sydney AFL Rising Star award and Brydon Coles taking home the coveted Phelan Medal for the Best & Fairest player in the Sydney AFL Premier Division. In 2010 the Students showed they belonged amongst the elite clubs in the Sydney AFL, taking out the minor premiership following a 14-game winning streak to end the home and away rounds. The club qualified for its maiden Sydney AFL Premier Division Grand Final since re-entry into the top flight with a hard-fought win against Western Suburbs. The club was experiencing its best season of the modern era, with its Division 1 and Colts sides also qualifying for the Grand Final, along with multiple individual award winners at the annual Sydney AFL awards night. Alex Lee took out the Phelan Medal, finishing 2nd in the vote tally but winning on default due to Damien Bowles from East Coast Eagles who accumulated more votes but was ruled ineligible due to a suspension through the year. This marked the first time in history an SUANFC player claimed the award two years in a row, whilst Tim Air collected the Snow Medal (awarded to Best and Fairest in Division 1) and Monty Krochmal was awarded the Kealy Medal (for U18 Premier Division B&F;). Roger Moten was named Sydney AFL Coach of the Year for his achievements. The Students were defeated on Grand Final day in both Premier Division and Division 1 by East Coast and UTS respectively, however the Colts were able to hoist the trophy in the Under 18s with a thrilling victory over their East Coast counterparts. 2011 saw Uni consolidate on their performances of the previous year, with the Senior team falling one game short of qualifying for a second consecutive Grand Final. However, the season was a success across all grades with all six teams at the club qualifying for finals action. The best performed side were the Division 3 'Reds' who were valiant in a Grand Final defeat at the hands of UNSW. Another highlight for the year was former Uni star Tom Young being selected to make his debut for Collingwood, thereby becoming the first Sydney University player to reach the AFL. In August, SUANFC accepted an invitation to the NEAFL which will see the proud club being pitted against opponents from NSW, Queensland, ACT and the Northern Territory from 2012 onward. 2012 was a year of mixed results for the Students, with the elevation of the Seniors to the North East Australian Football League (NEAFL). The elevation of the Seniors to the NEAFL also saw the club's Reserves side elevated to the Sydney AFL Premier Division, however the 3rd to 5th grade sides remained in their existing divisions (3rd Grade ‚Äì Div 2, 4th Grade ‚Äì Div 3, 5th Grade ‚Äì Div 5). While the Seniors and Reserves struggled to post many wins for the year, the club did taste success in the lower grades with all three lower grade sides playing finals. The most successful of these sides was the Division 5 'Golds' who triumphed over arch-rivals UTS by 5 points in a thrilling Grand Final at Blacktown International Sportspark to deliver the club its only premiership for 2012. 2013 was a year that saw two divisional changes, including the 5th grade 'Golds' being elevated to Division 4 and the birth of a new division 5 side (6th Grade 'Platinums'). The 3rd Grade ‚Äì Div 2 'blues' enjoyed winning a premiership over Manly. While the 5th Grade ‚Äì Div 4 'Golds' were unlucky to lose the final to Pennant Hills. The 4th Grade ‚Äì Div 3 'Reds', Under 18's and first year 6th Grade ‚Äì Div 5 'Platinums' all managed to make finals.

Here, a concrete transport truck is feeding concrete to a concrete pumper, which is pumping it to where a slab is being poured. Pumping concrete into aluminum concrete formwork in Mexico. A concrete pump is a machine used for transferring liquid concrete by pumping. There are two types of concrete pumps. The first type of concrete pump is attached to a truck or longer units are on semi-trailers. It is known as a boom concrete pump because it uses a remote-controlled articulating robotic arm (called a boom) to place concrete accurately. Boom pumps are used on most of the larger construction projects as they are capable of pumping at very high volumes and because of the labour saving nature of the placing boom. They are a revolutionary alternative to line-concrete pumps. The second main type of concrete pump is either mounted on a truck or placed on a trailer, and it is commonly referred to as a line pump or trailer-mounted concrete pump. This pump requires steel or flexible concrete placing hoses to be manually attached to the outlet of the machine. Those hoses are linked together and lead to wherever the concrete needs to be placed. The length of the hoses varies typically 10‚Äô, 12.5‚Äô, 25‚Äô and 50‚Äô depending on the diameter of the hose. Line pumps normally pump concrete at lower volumes than boom pumps and are used for smaller volume concrete placing applications such as swimming pools, sidewalks, and single family home concrete slabs and most ground slabs. There are also skid mounted and rail mounted concrete pumps, but these are uncommon and only used on specialized jobsites such as mines and tunnels.  History  Until the early 20th century, concrete was mixed on the job site and transported from the cement mixer to the formwork, either in wheelbarrows or in buckets lifted by cranes. This required a lot of time and labor. In 1927, the German engineers Max Giese and Fritz Hull came upon the idea of pumping concrete through pipes. They pumped concrete to a height of and a distance of . Shortly after, a concrete pump was patented in Holland in 1932 by Jacob Cornelius Kweimn (Jacobus Cornelius Kooijman). This patent incorporated the developer's previous German patent. Mechanism Concrete pump designers face many challenges because concrete is heavy, viscous, abrasive, contains pieces of hard rock, and solidifies if not kept moving. Operating principle of piston pump with seat valves Usually, piston pumps are used, because they can produce hundreds of atmospheres of pressure. Such piston-style pumps can push cylinders of heterogenous concrete mixes (aggregate + cement). The pump below uses a transfer tube valve, and the one on the right uses seat valves.

The test is named after mathematician Niels Henrik Abel. There are two slightly different versions of Abel's test - one is used with series of real numbers, and the other is used with power series in complex analysis. Abel's uniform convergence test is a criterion for the uniform convergence of a series of functions dependent on parameters.  Abel's test in real analysis  Suppose the following statements are true: # \\\\sum a_n is a convergent series, # {bn} is a monotone sequence, and # {bn} is bounded. Then \\\\sum a_nb_n is also convergent. It is important to understand that this test is mainly pertinent and useful in the context of non absolutely convergent series \\\\sum a_n. For absolutely convergent series, this theorem, albeit true, is almost self evident. This theorem can be proved directly using summation by parts.  Abel's test in complex analysis  A closely related convergence test, also known as Abel's test, can often be used to establish the convergence of a power series on the boundary of its circle of convergence. Specifically, Abel's test states that if a sequence of positive real numbers (a_n) is decreasing monotonically (or at least that for all n greater than some natural number m, we have a_n \\\\geq a_{n+1}) with : \\\\lim_{n\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty} a_n = 0 then the power series : f(z) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty a_nz^n converges everywhere on the closed unit circle, except when z = 1. Abel's test cannot be applied when z = 1, so convergence at that single point must be investigated separately. Notice that Abel's test implies in particular that the radius of convergence is at least 1. It can also be applied to a power series with radius of convergence R ‚â† 1 by a simple change of variables Œ∂ = z/R.(Moretti, 1964, p. 91) Notice that Abel's test is a generalization of the Leibniz Criterion by taking z = ‚àí1. Proof of Abel's test: Suppose that z is a point on the unit circle, z ‚â† 1. For each n\\\\geq1, we define : f_n(z):=\\\\sum_{k=0}^n a_k z^k. By multiplying this function by (1 ‚àí z), we obtain : \\\\begin{align} (1-z)f_n(z) & = \\\\sum_{k=0}^n a_k (1-z)z^k = \\\\sum_{k=0}^n a_k z^k - \\\\sum_{k=0}^n a_k z^{k+1} = a_0 + \\\\sum_{k=1}^n a_k z^k - \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n+1} a_{k-1} z^k \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = a_0 - a_n z^{n+1} + \\\\sum_{k=1}^n (a_k - a_{k-1}) z^k . \\\\end{align} The first summand is constant, the second converges uniformly to zero (since by assumption the sequence (a_n) converges to zero). It only remains to show that the series converges. We will show this by showing that it even converges absolutely: \\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty \\\\left|(a_k - a_{k-1}) z^k \\\\right= \\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty |a_k- a_{k-1}|\\\\cdot |z|^k \\\\leq \\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty (a_{k-1}-a_{k}) where the last sum is a converging telescoping sum. The absolute value vanished because the sequence (a_n) is decreasing by assumption. Hence, the sequence (1-z)f_n(z) converges (even uniformly) on the closed unit disc. If z ot = 1, we may divide by (1 ‚àí z) and obtain the result.  Abel's uniform convergence test  Abel's uniform convergence test is a criterion for the uniform convergence of a series of functions or an improper integration of functions dependent on parameters. It is related to Abel's test for the convergence of an ordinary series of real numbers, and the proof relies on the same technique of summation by parts. The test is as follows. Let {gn} be a uniformly bounded sequence of real-valued continuous functions on a set E such that gn+1(x) ‚â§ gn(x) for all x ‚àà E and positive integers n, and let {fn} be a sequence of real-valued functions such that the series Œ£fn(x) converges uniformly on E. Then Œ£fn(x)gn(x) converges uniformly on E.

Replacing an earlier cinema of the same name destroyed in a fire, the new theatre, designed by Henry Eli White opened in 1927. With a capacity of nearly 3,000 people, it is the largest seated theatre in Australia. It is one of the early-20th-century picture palaces to survive in Australia, and is included on the Victorian Heritage Register. It is a major local landmark and an important part of the early-20th-century development of the St Kilda beach foreshore as an entertainment precinct. In 2015, the Palais Theatre was inducted into the Music Victoria Hall of Fame. History The Palais Theatre was developed by the Phillips brothers (Leon, Herman and Harold), who hailed from Spokane, Washington. Their first venture here, with fellow American showman James Dixon Williams, was Luna Park, which opened on the St Kilda foreshore in 1912. Williams left the partnership and returned to the United States in about 1913, leaving the Phillips brothers to expand their entertainment business. The Phillipses' next ventures were a series of dance halls and picture theatres on the 'triangle site', across a small road from Luna Park. They began in 1913 with the first Palais de Danse, on the site of the current Palais Theatre. In 1915, this building was converted into Palais Pictures. In 1919, an arched- truss steel-framed structure that was to be a new Palais Pictures was built over the old Palais, which was then dismantled and relocated next door, to the north, becoming a dance hall again, the twin-towered arched-roofed Palais de Danse. In 1922 the interior of the Palais de Danse was remodelled to a design by the architect Walter Burley Griffin. In 1925, Griffin was again employed to design a substantial remodelling of the Palais Pictures next door; work was nearly complete in 1926 when a fire destroyed the whole building. The Philips brothers then commissioned a new architect, theatre specialist Henry Eli White, to build a larger, grander theatre. This new theatre, with the largest seating capacity outside the main central city theatres, was officially opened by the Mayor of St Kilda on 12 November 1927. The next night the first films screened were Across the Pacific, starring Monte Blue, and Rough House Rosie, starring Clara Bow, with interval entertainment provided by Harry Jacobs and his orchestra. When the last of the Phillips brothers died in 1957, the Palais, the Palais de Danse and Luna Park passed to local entrepreneurs. A brass plaque, still in place on the second level of the Palais, bears a tribute to Leon Phillips from members of the American community of Victoria. The theatre, which had operated primarily as a cinema until the 1950s, became increasingly popular as a live performance venue, hosting top overseas stars such as Johnnie Ray, Bob Hope, the Rolling Stones, Tom Jones and many others. At some point in the 1950s, the name was changed from Palais Pictures to Palais Theatre, reflecting its new role, and the neon sign on the front was changed accordingly. In the 1960s and '70s, the Palais hosted live acts, films, opera and ballet. The Bolshoi Theatre, the Kirov Ballet and the Stars of World Ballet performed, and it was the Melbourne venue for The Australian Ballet,History & Archives , Palais Theatre Official Site ‚Äì accessed 3 May 2009 who premiered Anne Woolliams' production of Swan Lake on 19 October 1977,Swan Lake , AustraliaDancing.org ‚Äì accessed 3 May 2009 and its first commissioned Nutcracker choreographed by Leonid Kozlov and Valentina Kozlova on 8 October 1982.Nutcracker, AustraliaDancing.org ‚Äì accessed 3 May 2009 The Melbourne Film Festival was based at the Palais from 1962 until 1982. Jesus Christ Superstar played at the Palais in 1973 and 1976, and Joan Sutherland appeared with the Australian Opera in The Merry Widow in 1979. In 1974/5, a Warner Brothers movie, A Film About Jimi Hendrix, had its Australian premiere at the Palais by special arrangement with the Paul Dainty Corporation. This was also the first time that a 1,000-watt sound system was used at a cinema screening in Australia. In 1969, the Palais de Danse was destroyed by fire and replaced by The Palace nightclub, which was closed in 2007 and subsequently demolished. In the mid-2000s, the City of Port Phillip, managers of the land, proposed a large-scale redevelopment of the St Kilda 'Triangle', the site including the Palais and the adjacent car park. The lease of the site and building, which was nearing its end, was not renewed with the then-lessee, who controversially removed a number of items, notably the Spanish-style lobby chandelier. After various court cases, it was determined that their ownership by the former lessee was valid, and they remain in storage as of 2017. Between 2007 and 2016 the venue was managed by Palais Theatre Management Pty Ltd, a body set up by the local City of Port Phillip. In 2016 a new 30-year lease was granted to Live Nation,, - accessed 11 July 2016 and the Premier of Victoria Daniel Andrews announced a $20 million restoration.Saving The Palais, - accessed 5 May 2016 The renovated theatre, repainted in its original sand colour after decades as off-white, reopened in May 2017. Architecture The theatre illuminated at night Typical of 1920s picture theatres, the architectural style is ornate, eclectic and exotic. The arched roof and twin domed towers of the fa√ßade is an arrangement shared by other entertainment buildings in the foreshore area, notably Luna Park next door, the St Kilda Sea Baths, and long demolished landmarks like the Palais de Danse to the north, and the St. Moritz Ice Rink on the Upper Esplanade. The architect Henry White stated that he adopted no particular style in the design of the Palais Pictures building, and the interior has been described at times as Spanish, French, Oriental and Italian. The exterior does features Spanish Baroque detailing on top of the towers, while the interior is broadly neoclassical with tall columns and pilasters and a shallow dome in the auditorium, with elaborate textured plaster surfaces and detailing in the Adam style, and extensive concealed lighting.

He was also an early advocate of Alaska statehood. Biography Robert Bruce Atwood, known as Bob Atwood or Robert Atwood, was born March 31, 1907 in Chicago, Illinois. He graduated from Clark University, and in 1932, married social worker Evangeline Atwood (n√©e Rasmuson). They had two daughters, Marilyn and Elaine.  Anchorage Times and Alaska statehood  49-star U.S. flag following President Dwight D. Eisenhower's signing of Alaska's statehood proclamation, January 3, 1959 Atwood moved to Anchorage, Alaska in 1935. With the help of his father-in-law, he purchased the struggling Anchorage Daily Times. Under his guidance, it became Alaska's largest daily newspaper. In 1949, the Alaska Territorial Legislature formed the Alaska Statehood Committee, appointing Atwood as Chairman. His pro-statehood lobbying efforts included visits to Washington, D.C. and a steady stream of articles in his newspaper, such as a 1955 editorial where he argued that whereas commonwealth status was \\"wonderful\\" for Puerto Rico, \\"it wouldn't give Alaskans self- government, control of resources, tax exemptions or any of a number of benefits claimed by its supporters here.\\" In 1954, Atwood partnered with brother-in-law Elmer E. Rasmuson to invest in the lease of potential oil fields on the Kenai Peninsula. The investment generated a fortune after Richfield Oil Corporation discovered oil in 1957 near the Swanson River. On June 30, 1958, the United States Senate passed the Alaska Statehood Act. Atwood's Anchorage Daily Times celebrated with a headline in six-inch type: ‚ÄúWE‚ÄôRE IN.‚Äù On January 3, 1959, Atwood was present (along with Senator Bob Bartlett and Ernest Gruening, Representative Ralph Julian Rivers and Territorial Governor Waino Hendrickson and Mike Stepovich) in the Cabinet Room when President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the proclamation that made Alaska the 49th state admitted into the United States.  Philanthropy  In 1962, Atwood endowed the Atwood Foundation to promote education and the arts. In 1979, he established the Atwood Chair of Journalism at the University of Alaska Anchorage. The Alaska Center for the Performing Arts was constructed in 1989, with the largest performance space designated as the Evangeline Atwood Concert Hall. In 1990, Robert Atwood stepped down as editor and sold the Anchorage Times to oil tycoon Bill Allen.  Death  Atwood died in Anchorage, Alaska on January 10, 1997, ten years after the death of his wife. Legacy At the time of his death, Robert Atwood was collaborating with journalist John Strohmeyer on a biography. After Atwood's death, Strohmeyer completed the work under the title Alaska Titan. But before it could be published, Atwood's daughter, Elaine, sued to prevent it from being distributed. In 1999, Strohmeyer and Elaine Atwood entered into an agreement giving Elaine Atwood two years to produce her own biography, to be entitled Bob Atwood's Alaska. Bob Atwood's Alaska did not appear until after Elaine Atwood's death in 2003. In 1998, the Robert B. Atwood Building at 550 W. Seventh Avenue in Anchorage was named by the Alaska State Legislature. The Atwood name also appears in the Atwood Center at Alaska Pacific University.

He was the first British Jewish career ambassador.  Biography  Phillips was born in Glasgow, the eldest of seven children, and the grandson of Jewish emigrants from Eastern Europe. After attending Hillhead High School he entered the Inland Revenue as a clerical officer. During the Second World War, he served in the British and Indian armies for seven years (Dorsetshire Regiment and 1st Punjab Regiment). He served in Iraq, India, Burma, Ceylon and Malaya, and reached the rank of major in the Indian Army. Having been rebuffed by the Consular Service before the war due to his social standing, Phillips joined the Diplomatic Service in 1947, and served successively in Persia, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Aden, and Iran. He was British ambassador to Indonesia from 1966 to 1968. That year, he was selected as the British ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Having given their agr√©ment, the Saudi government withdrew it when it was learned that Phillips was Jewish, even though Phillips had previously served in Saudi Arabia without any incident. Though it was reported in the media at the time that he was an \\"ex-Jew\\" or \\"non-practising Jew\\", he was in fact a member of a synagogue, and a religious Jew throughout his life. After the abortive Saudi appointment, he was appointed British high commissioner to Tanzania in 1968 and British ambassador to Turkey in 1973, and was in post when Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974. He retired in 1977, and enjoyed a second career of ten years as resident representative for Taylor Woodrow. He also lectured at Bilkent University in Ankara until 1997, latterly on the history of diplomacy. Phillips was appointed CMG in 1963, and KCMG in 1973. He was married to Idina, Lady Phillips (n√©e Idina Doreen Morgan) for over 60 years. They had two children and four grown-up grandchildren, one of whom is the BBC correspondent Luisa Baldini.

Llanfyllin's population in 2011 was 1,532, of whom 34.1% could speak Welsh. Llanfyllin means church or parish (llan) of St Myllin ('m' frequently mutates to 'f' in Welsh). Geography The valley of the River Cain near Llanfyllin The town lies in the valley of the River Cain near the Berwyn Mountains in Montgomeryshire, southwest of Oswestry and from Montgomery. The River Cain is joined by the small River Abel in Llanfyllin (presumably named after Cain and Abel in the Bible), and meanders through the valley, flowing into the River Vyrnwy at Llansantffraid. History The town lies between Shrewsbury and Bala, for a long time the key market towns in this area of Wales and the Welsh borders. At nearby Bodyddon there is evidence of an early British settlement. Llanfyllin may be the \\"Mediolanum among the Ordovices\\" described in Ptolemy's Geography (),Williams, Robert. \\"A History of the Parish of Llanfyllin\\" in Collections Historical & Archaeological Relating to Montgomeryshire, Vol. III, p. 59\\\\.

The well is dedicated to Saint Myllin, who is reputed to have baptised people here in the sixth century. The parish church is also dedicated to Saint Myllin. There is a tradition that Saint Myllin is the Irish bishop, Saint Mo Ling (also named Moling Luachra) (614‚Äì697). However, this is uncertain. There is no record of Mo Ling travelling to Wales, and there is a tradition that Myllin is buried under the altar of Llanfyllin church whereas Mo Ling is believed to have been buried at his monastery in Ireland. The medieval motte and bailey castle of Tomen yr Allt was probably destroyed by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd in 1257. The castle earthworks are still present. Llanfyllin was granted a charter as a market town in 1293 by Llywelyn ap Dafydd under EdwardI, one of only two Welsh towns to have received its charter from a native ruler. The charter was confirmed by Edward de Charlton, Lord of Powys under HenryV. Buildings Llanfyllin is noteworthy for the quality and quantity of its buildings in locally-made brick. St Myllin's Church Church of St Myllin The parish church of St Myllin (Church in Wales) was founded in the seventh century, according to tradition by St Myllin. The present building which dates to around 1706 is mainly of locally-made red brick with battlements and a Welsh slate roof. It has a tower with six bells. It was adapted and extended by 1863 in the neo- Norman style, and restored in 1959. Pendref Chapel Pendref Chapel (Congregationalist) is said to be the oldest Welsh independent church in Powys. In 1640 its first minister was Vavasor Powell. The chapel was initially built in 1708. The chapel was destroyed in the Jacobite rising of 1715, and was re-erected at government expense. The present building dates from 1829. Rhosfawr hall house A late-15th or early-16th century hall house at Rhosfawr () near Llanfyllin, it is a Grade II* Listed Building. It has been used as a barn since the 17th century and has never been altered, and is perhaps the most complete and unaltered medium-sized hall house in Wales. It consists of four bays, crucks at the gables, a central truss, box-frame trusses and two tiers of trenched purlins with heavy curved wind braces. The central bays formed the hall. The Hall An historic house known as The Hall still exists on Vine Square within the town. Its origins as Plas Uchaf (Welsh for Upper Hall) are 16th century, it is a T-shaped two-storey timber- framed building with an attached open hall, remodelled in about 1599 adding a floor in the hall and stairs between the house and the hall. It was further remodelled in 1832 with the addition of an extra storey and three gables facing the square. King CharlesI stayed at The Hall in November 1643. The Hall is Grade II listed. Bodfach Hall grounds Bodfach Hall Bodfach house and grounds c.1781 Bodfach Hall is a GradeII listed building about 1 km north-west of Llanfyllin in the hamlet of Bodfach. It is likely that a house was built on the site after the destruction in 1257 of Tomen yr Allt, a motte-and-bailey castle which stood on one of the hills above it. The property is first recorded in 1160 in the will of Madog ap Maredudd, Prince of Powys. Sion Kyffin, a descendant of Madog, extended a house on the site in 1661, as recorded in an inscription above an old door on the west of the house. The house was considerably modified and extended over the years and was rebuilt . In 1945 the estate was broken up; most of the land was bought by its tenant farmers, and the hall and 33 acres were sold to one buyer to become an hotel. Llanfyllin Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1909 in Bodfach Park; the president was Sir John Lomax, the owner of Bodfach Hall and former High Sheriff of Montgomeryshire. It was a 9-hole course with a membership of 40 in 1914. It disappeared after World War I. Llanfyllin Union Workhouse Llanfyllin Union Workhouse Llanfyllin is also increasingly well known for the old Union Workhouse, known as Y Dolydd () locally, and built in 1838. This old Victorian building had stood empty since the mid-1980s until a local voluntary group, the Llanfyllin Workhouse Project, started to renovate it for community use. It is also home to the Llanfyllin Workhouse Festival. Notable people * William Morgan (1545‚Äì1604), translator of the Bible into Welsh, was appointed rector of Llanfyllin in 1579. He was at the same time vicar of nearby Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant. He was later Bishop of Llandaff and of St Asaph. *Tomos Prys (Thomas Price) (c.1564‚Äì1634), soldier, sailor, buccaneer and poet, is said to have lived in The Hall. *Roger Palmer, 1st Earl of Castlemaine (1634‚Äì1705), courtier, diplomat and politician lived in The Hall.

Governance Llanfyllin Council forms the lowest tier of local government and has twelve councillors. Llanfyllin is an electoral ward of Powys County Council. It is represented by one county councillor who, since 2008, has been Welsh Conservative Party representative Peter Lewis. Education The town has a primary school, and the bilingual Llanfyllin High School with approximately 1,000 pupils from the town and the surrounding area, about a quarter of whom travel from Shropshire, over the English border. The 2009 inspection of the High School reported GCSE examination results as well above the local and national average. Transport railway station (closed 1965) The town sits on the main route between Welshpool and Bala. The A490 road connects the town to Churchstoke, and terminates just after passing through the town. The Llanfyllin Branch of the Cambrian Railways opened in 1863, to provide access to the limestone quarries along the valley, terminating at station. The main line from to closed in 1965, as did the branch line to Llanfyllin, under the \\"Beeching Axe\\". The Lonely Tree of Llanfyllin The Lonely Tree The Lonely Tree of Llanfyllin was a large Scots Pine in an isolated position on Green Hall Hill above the town (at ). It was estimated to have been 200 years old. It featured in several local traditions: it was hugged for good fortune, marriages were proposed at the tree and cremation ashes were scattered beneath it. The Lonely Tree was named Wales Tree of the Year 2014 by the Woodland Trust, and was entered in the 2015 European Tree of the Year competition. It fell in a storm in February 2014. An unsuccessful attempt was made to rescue it by packing its roots with nearly sixty tonnes of earth.

In 1849, he married the artist Eliza Pratt. Prior to settling in New York City as a teacher of music and organist at Calvary Church, he played at churches in Hartford, Connecticut, including Center Church and St. John's Episcopal Church in the adjacent city of West Hartford, Connecticut.Allen, N. H. \\"Old Time Music and Musicians.\\" Connecticut Quarterly, Volume II, 1896, pp. 154-157. Greatorex frequently sang in concerts and oratorios. For some years he was organist and conductor of the choir at St. Paul's chapel. Greatorex did much to advance the standard of sacred music in the United States in the days when country singing-school teachers imposed their trivial melodies and the convivial measures of foreign composers on the texts of the hymn books at hand. He published a Collection of Psalm and Hymn Tunes, Chants, Anthems, and Sentences (Boston, 1851). One of Greatorex's best-known compositions is a setting of the Gloria Patri, widely used in Protestant denominations for the singing of the doxology in services to this day. He died in Charleston, South Carolina.

It primarily concerns the protection of tangible information-related assets such as computer systems and storage media against physical, real-world threats such as unauthorized physical access, theft, fire and flood. It typically involves physical controls such as protective barriers and locks, uninterruptible power supplies, and shredders. Information security controls in the physical domain complement those in the logical domain (such as encryption), and procedural or administrative controls (such as information security awareness and compliance with policies and laws).  Background  Asset are inherently valuable and yet vulnerable to a wide variety of threats, both malicious (e.g. theft, arson) and accidental/natural (e.g. lost property, bush fire). If threats materialize and exploit those vulnerabilities causing incidents, there are likely to be adverse impacts on the organizations or individuals who legitimately own and utilize the assets, varying from trivial to devastating in effect. Security controls are intended to reduce the probability or frequency of occurrence and/or the severity of the impacts arising from incidents, thus protecting the value of the assets. Physical security involves the use of controls such as smoke detectors, fire alarms and extinguishers, along with related laws, regulations, policies and procedures concerning their use. Barriers such as fences, walls and doors are obvious physical security controls, designed to deter or prevent unauthorized physical access to a controlled area, such as a home or office. The moats and battlements of Mediaeval castles are classic examples of physical access controls, as are bank vaults and safes. Information security controls protect the value of information assets, particularly the information itself (i.e. the intangible information content, data, intellectual property, knowledge etc.) but also computer and telecommunications equipment, storage media (including papers and digital media), cables and other tangible information-related assets (such as computer power supplies). The corporate mantra \\"Our people are our greatest assets\\" is literally true in the sense that so-called knowledge workers qualify as extremely valuable, perhaps irreplaceable information assets. Health and safety measures and even medical practice could therefore also be classed as physical information security controls since they protect humans against injuries, diseases and death. This perspective exemplifies the ubiquity and value of information. Modern human society is heavily reliant on information, and information has importance and value at a deeper, more fundamental level. In principle, the subcellular biochemical mechanisms that maintain the accuracy of DNA replication could even be classed as vital information security controls, given that genes are 'the information of life'. Malicious actors who may benefit from physical access to information assets include computer crackers, corporate spies, and fraudsters. The value of information assets is self-evident in the case of, say, stolen laptops or servers that can be sold-on for cash, but the information content is often far more valuable, for example encryption keys or passwords (used to gain access to further systems and information), trade secrets and other intellectual property (inherently valuable or valuable because of the commercial advantages they confer), and credit card numbers (used to commit identity fraud and further theft). Furthermore, the loss, theft or damage of computer systems, plus power interruptions, mechanical/electronic failures and other physical incidents prevent them being used, typically causing disruption and consequential costs or losses. Unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, and even the coercive threat of such disclosure, can be damaging as we saw in the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack at the end of 2014 and in numerous privacy breach incidents. Even in the absence of evidence that disclosed personal information has actually been exploited, the very fact that it is no longer secured and under the control of its rightful owners is itself a potentially harmful privacy impact. Substantial fines, adverse publicity/reputational damage and other noncompliance penalties and impacts that flow from serious privacy breaches are best avoided, regardless of cause!  Examples of physical attacks to obtain information  There are several ways to obtain information through physical attacks or exploitations. A few examples are described below.  Dumpster diving  Dumpster diving is the practice of searching through trash in the hope of obtaining something valuable such as information carelessly discarded on paper, computer disks or other hardware.  Overt access  Sometimes attackers will simply go into a building and take the information they need. Frequently when using this strategy, an attacker will masquerade as someone who belongs in the situation. They may pose as a copy room employee, remove a document from someone's desk, copy the document, replace the original, and leave with the copied document. Individuals pretending to building maintenance may gain access to otherwise restricted spaces. They might walk right out of the building with a trash bag containing sensitive documents, carrying portable devices or storage media that were left out on desks, or perhaps just having memorized a password on a sticky note stuck to someone's computer screen or called out to a colleague across an open office.  Examples of Physical Information Security Controls  Literally shredding paper documents prior to their disposal is a commonplace physical information security control, intended to prevent the information content - if not the media - from falling into the wrong hands. Digital data can also be shredded in a figurative sense, either by being strongly encrypted or by being repeatedly overwritten until there is no realistic probability of the information ever being retrieved, even using sophisticated forensic analysis: this too constitutes a physical information security control since the purged computer storage media can be freely discarded or sold without compromising the original information content. The two techniques may be combined in high-security situations, where digital shredding of the data content is followed by physical shredding and incineration to destroy the storage media. Many organizations restrict physical access to controlled areas such as their offices by requiring that people present valid identification cards, proximity passes or physical keys. Provided the access tokens or devices are themselves strictly controlled and secure (making it hard for unauthorized people to obtain or fabricate and use them), and the associated electronic or mechanical locks, doors, walls, barriers etc. are sufficiently strong and complete, unauthorized physical entry to the controlled areas is prevented, protecting the information and other assets within. Likewise, office workers are generally encouraged or required to obey \\"clear desk\\" policies, protecting documents and other storage media (including portable IT devices) by tidying them away out of sight, perhaps in locked drawers, filing cabinets, safes or vaults according to the risks. Requiring workers to memorize their passwords rather than writing them down in a place that might be observed by an onlooker (maybe a colleague, visitor or intruder) is an example of risk avoidance. Computers plainly need electrical power, hence they are vulnerable to issues such as power cuts, accidental disconnection, flat batteries, brown-outs, surges, spikes, electrical interference and electronic failures. Physical information security controls to address the associated risks include: fuses, no-break battery- backed power supplies, electrical generators, redundant power sources and cabling, \\"Do not remove\\" warning signs on plugs, surge protectors, power quality monitoring, spare batteries, professional design and installation of power circuits plus regular inspections/tests and preventive maintenance. It is ironic that so-called uninterruptible power supplies often lead to power interruptions if they are inadequately specified, designed, manufactured, used, managed or maintained - an illustration of the failure of a critical (physical) control.

Often this sound is written simply z, hence the different spellings. (\\"The Story of Tambuka\\"), Utenzi wa Hirqal or Kyuo kya Here·∏≥ali (the book of Heraclius), is an epic poem in the Swahili language, dated 1728. It is one of the earliest known documents in Swahili. Known by various titles in English, including The Book of the Battle of Tambuka and The Story of Heraclius, the story recounts numerous events of the Byzantine-Arab Wars and Byzantine- Ottoman Wars between the Muslims and Romans (the contemporary name for the Byzantines). The Byzantines were represented by the Emperor of the Byzantine Empire, Heraclius. The story covers a period from 628 (the Battle of Mu'tah) to 1453 (the Fall of Constantinople).Knappert 1977:8. \\"Tambuka\\" is the Swahili rendering of Tabuk, a city located in north-western Saudi Arabia. The oldest manuscript of the epic is dated 1141 on the Islamic Calendar, corresponding to AD 1728. It was written at Yunga, a royal palace in the old city of Pate (the palace has since been destroyed). In strophe 1124‚Äì1125, the author notes that the \\"king of Yung\\"' (that is, the then Sultan of Pate) asked him to write an epic on the heroic deeds of the first followers of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The author identifies himself in one of the final stanzas (1146) as Mwengo, son of Athumani or Osman. Not much more is known about him other than that he wrote at the court of the Sultan of Pate, that he was no longer a young man by 1728, and that some other poems are ascribed to him.Knappert 1977:15‚Äì16. He also had a son, Abu Bakr bin Mwengo, who wrote an imitation of his father's epic somewhere in the middle of the 18th century.Knappert 1969:81. Like other manuscripts of the period in Swahili, the Utendi wa Tambuka is written in Arabic script. The language used is a northern dialect of Swahili called Kiamu; some manuscripts, however, show influence from Kigunya (another northern dialect), while others show traces of Kiunguja, the dialect of Zanzibar.Knappert 1977:9. Form The Utendi wa Tambuka is a prime example of the Swahili poetic form of utenzi. Utenzi verse form consists of four-line stanzas, with each line having eight syllables. The last syllables of the first three lines rhyme with each other, while the fourth line has a rhyme that is constant throughout the whole of the epic. This last rhyme thus serves to tie all stanzas of the epic together. Most Swahili words have penultimate stress, resulting in every line having at least penultimate stress. Within a line of eight syllables there are no further meter requirements.Knappert 1977:30‚Äì32. The verse form can be illustrated by the first stanza of the poem:In Knappert's Latin transcription, based on the Arabic manuscript U.) :Bisimillahi kutÃ†ubu :yina la Mola Wahhabu :ArrahÃ£amani eribu :na ArrahÃ£imu ukyowa The first three lines all end in -bu. The last syllable of the fourth line ends in the vowel a, and this sound is found at the end of every stanza of the poem. When recited, this last syllable is sustained for some time and given emphasis. Content The plot depicts a religious war between the Byzantines and the Muslims. The Prophet sends a letter to East Roman/Byzantine Emperor Heraclius, in which he tells him that the Byzantine belief that Jesus is the son of God is incorrect. Heraclius declares his intent to persevere in his adherence to Christianity on the grounds that the Byzantines have inherited their belief from their ancestors. The Muslims attack and, after epic struggles, eventually defeat the Byzantines. Heraclius' minister and his associates are captured and once again given the choice to accept Islam or die; they refuse to be converted and are executed.Summary of the plot of the poem at the Swahili Manuscripts Project at the School of Oriental and African Studies of London. The central figure of the poem, and the most heroic one, is Ali ibn Abi Talib, a full nephew on the father's side of the Prophet. He is nicknamed Haidar, the lion, and in the course of the poem many other praise names are applied to him. Ali was married to the noble daughter of the prophet Muhammad, Fatimah. The second hero in order of magnitude is Umar ibn al-Khattab. See also * Swahili literature Notes References Sources * G√©rard, Albert S. (1990). Contexts of African Literature.

Biography From his name it would appear that his origin was a place called Tolosa. The Hida and others wrote that he was from Tolosa, Spain;See Shalshelet haKabbalah and Kore haDorot while modern scholar Israel Netanel Rubin placed his origin at Toulouse.Israel Netanel Rubin, Rabbi Vidal de Tolosa, Author of \\"Magid Mishne\\", and His Attitude to Philosophy and Science, Daat: A Journal of Jewish Philosophy & Kabbalah, No. 84 (◊™◊©◊¢\\"◊ó/ 2017), pp. 139-154 He lived in Villefranche-de-ConflentAccording to a responsum signed by him from the year 1346 and later in Barcelona,According to Catalonian records, in 1367 he was living in Barcelona where he met Nissim of Gerona and published Maggid Mishneh. From Joseph Caro's preface to his Kesef Mishneh it appears that Vidal was a personal friend of Nissim of Gerona. Vidal's son Isaac was also a prominent scholar, who lived in Alcala and corresponded with Isaac ben Sheshet.According to Isaac ben Sheshet's responsa number 473 Writings Maggid Mishneh His most important work was Maggid Mishneh, a commentary on Maimonides' Mishneh Torah. This work covered the entire Mishneh Torah, but by 1906 only those parts were extant which cover the following books: 3 (Zemanim), 4 (Nashim), 5 (Kedusha) (chapters 1-9 only), 11 (Nezikim), 12 (Kinyan) (chapters 1-3 only), and 13 (Mishpatim). It is considered one of the most important commentaries on Mishneh Torah. When there is a halachic dispute regarding the proper understanding of the Mishneh Torah, it is common to rule according to the understanding of the Maggid Mishneh. In addition, Vidal's approach is commonly held to reflect that of Shlomo ibn Aderet, so that when there is dispute over the meaning of Aderet's words, it is common to rule according to the Vidal's understanding.See Haim Shabtai, Torat Haim, Even haEzer 31 Before the twentieth century, the commentary was never published separately, but only together with the Mishneh Torah (first at Constantinople, 1509). Other works Vidal's second work was a commentary in Arabic on a work by Al-Ghazali that is known in Hebrew as To'elet ha-Higgayon. This commentary was translated into Hebrew by Moses ben Joshua of Narbonne, and as of 1906 was extant in manuscript in the Library of the Vatican.

The HPOT typically operates at 28,120 rpm and boosts the liquid oxygen pressure from 422 to 4,300 psi (2.91 to 29.6 MPa). There are 2 sensor channels measuring temperature on the HPOT. The B channel indicated a redline condition while the other was near redline conditions. The redline limit to initiate a shutdown is at 867 K. This limit increases to 980 K at (5.3 s after Main Engine Start). Main Engine #3 (SN 2032) has been used on two previous flights with of hot- fire time and a total of eight starts. This was the first flight for the HPOT on Main Engine (SSME) #3. A new launch date was set for early October and then moved up to late September. The procedure that has been used on previous aborts treats an RSLS abort after SSME ignition as a launch and to require a complete engine reinspection. A rollback of Endeavour to the VAB was done on 24 August 1994. Afterwards, Endeavour's SSMEs were removed and inspected. Three flight certified SSMEs (removed from the Atlantis STS-66 mission) were installed on the orbiter and Endeavour was rolled back to the launch pad on 13 September 1994.

On Friday, 30 September 1994 at 5 pm CDT, STS-68 MCC Status Report # 2 reports: Shortly after 4 pm that day, flight controllers reported that the on-orbit checkout of the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C (SIR-C) and the Synthetic Aperture Radar (X-SAR) had been completed, and that the primary SRL-2 instruments were ready for operation. Throughout the checkout, data takes were recorded over a number of sites, including Raco, Michigan; Bermuda; Bebedouro, Brazil; the Northeast Pacific Ocean and the Juan de Fuca Strait, between the United States and Canada. In addition to the prime payload, Wilcutt also activated the Commercial Protein Crystal Growth Experiment, the Cosmic Radiation Effects and Activation Monitor, and checked on the mouse-ear cress seedlings growing in the CHROMEX-05 experiment. The crew successfully engineered an in-flight maintenance procedure to get additional cooling air to the CPCG apparatus after higher than desired temperatures were noted by crystal growth sensors. On Saturday, 1 October 1994 at 9 am CDT, STS-68 MCC Status Report # 3 reports: Environmental studies continued throughout Saturday morning aboard Endeavour as six astronauts working around the clock in two shifts assisted the Space Radar Laboratory science team on the ground with real-time observations from space. While Commander Mike Baker and Pilot Terry Wilcutt made attitude adjustments of the orbiter to assist in precisely pointing the radar systems, Mission Specialist Jeff Wisoff provided running commentary and tape recording assistance for the many ground sites as Endeavour passed overhead at an altitude of . The STS-68 mission's three other crew members‚ÄîSteve Smith, Dan Bursch and Tom Jones‚Äîperform the same duties on the opposite shift, beginning at about 4:30 this afternoon. Late Friday night, Tom Jones sent down some video of a volcano erupting in Kamchatka. The experiment scientists reported the volcano began erupting a couple of weeks ago, but the latest \\"burst\\" from the Kliuchevskoi (pronounced clue-chev-skoy) volcano occurred about eight hours after Endeavour's 6:16 am launch Friday. The SRL team is planning a series of data takes using the radar equipment as Endeavour moves over that area of the world. Those images will be compared with similar radar images gathered during the STS-59 mission in April, prior to the volcanic activity. Other radar data gathering of the Earth's surface today included the desert regions of Africa, both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and mountainous regions of the East and West coasts of the United States. Early Saturday, Mike Baker sent down a short video tape of smudges and streaks he noticed shortly after launch on several of the forward flight deck windows. None of the streaks would hamper visual observations during entry and landing slated for Monday, 10 October. On Sunday, 2 October 1994 at 9 am CDT, STS-68 MCC Status Report # 4 reports: Radar data gathering today included forest areas of North Carolina, ocean current patterns in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, desert areas in Africa, and mountainous regions of the East and West coasts of the United States. On Monday, 3 October 1994 at 10 am CDT, STS-68 MCC Status Report # 5 reports: Endeavour's Space Radar Laboratory equipment continued to search the Earth's land masses and oceans for environmental changes that have occurred since the last SRL mission in April. The Red Team of Mike Baker, Terry Wilcutt and Jeff Wisoff will be on duty throughout much of the day while the Blue Team of Steve Smith, Dan Bursch and Tom Jones sleeps. Radar data gathering today included much of the East Coast of the United States, current patterns in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans as well as other bodies of water, desert areas in Africa, and mountainous regions around the world. Mission Specialist Jeff Wisoff pinpointed storms, lightning and fires and relayed the information to the SRL science team. His observations help correlate and corroborate data collected from the science instruments, including the measurement of air pollution by satellite, which measures carbon monoxide levels in the atmosphere. Taking such measurements on this flight helps understand changes in the distribution of carbon monoxide as well as other seasonal changes in the environment that have occurred since Endeavour's last mission in April. On Monday, 3 October 1994 at 5 pm CDT, STS-68 MCC Status Report # 6 reports: Endeavour's payload bay cameras sent to Earth dramatic video of the western coast of Oregon and the length of California and the Baja Peninsula that scientists will compare with radar images downlinked from Space Radar Laboratory-2 instruments earlier in the flight. The observations were part of a continuing effort to watch the Earth below for evidence of environmental changes that have occurred since the last SRL mission in April. The overall goal of the mission to better understand the differences in changes caused by natural processes and compare them to changes brought about by human activity. Radar data was recorded today over much of the East Coast of the United States, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, Manitoba, Canada, and French Guyana. Special readings were taken with the Measurement of Air Pollution by Satellite instrument as intentionally set fires were monitored by scientists from the University of Iowa and the Canadian Forest Service. The wind field and thermal evolution of the fires will be analyzed to provide a better interpretation of carbon monoxide emissions from the burning forest and to help calibrate color infrared photography taken by the STS-68 crew. These fires were planned in advance of the mission, and would have been set for forest management purposes even if the shuttle mission were not in progress. Astronauts relayed information about storms, lightning, fires and clear cutting to the SRL science team that will be used to help understand the radar images and MAPS data on carbon monoxide levels in the atmosphere. On Tuesday, 4 October 1994 at 9 am CDT, STS-68 MCC Status Report # 7 reports: STS-68 crew members this morning performed two slight maneuvers to fine-tune Endeavour's orbit to mirror its track on the first Space Radar Laboratory mission to support a new experiment called interferometry. The trim burns adjust the orbit to within of where it was in April which will allow scientists to make near identical measurements with the radar equipment to develop a three- dimensional comparison of environmental changes during the six months separating the two missions‚ÄîSTS-59 and STS-68. On Tuesday, 4 October 1994 at 5 pm CDT, STS-68 MCC Status Report # 8 reports: Space Radar Laboratory-2 scientists adjusted their observation plans to take advantage of an opportunity to train their instruments on the islands of Japan following a Tuesday night earthquake there. Endeavour passed over the Sarobetsu, Japan, calibration site about 3:30 pm CDT, and the Synthetic Aperture Radar sent down real-time data of the area below, allowing scientists to look for changes in the coastline of the islands that may have been due to the large tsunami waves associated with the quake. The Spaceborne Imaging Radar also recorded data on the area. STS-68 crew members continued to perform slight maneuvers to fine- tune Endeavour's orbit to intersect its track on the SRL-1 mission to support a new experiment called interferometry. The trim burns adjusted the orbit to within of where it was in April as it passed over the Mammoth Mountain, Calif., backup supersite. This should allow scientists to make nearly identical measurements with the radar equipment to develop a three-dimensional comparison of environmental changes during the six months separating STS-59 and STS-68. Radar images over the Sahara desert and the North Atlantic will help scientists evaluate global changes and how they affect the climates in other areas of the world. Also on 4 October, Payload Commander Tom Jones discussed the significance of radar systems and the Earth's environment in an interview with ABC's Good Morning America. Mission Specialist Jeff Wisoff discussed the mission with CONUS Communications Syndicate affiliates WTKR-TV in his hometown of Norfolk, Va., and the All-News Channel in Minneapolis. On Wednesday, 5 October 1994 at 8 am CDT, STS-68 MCC Status Report # 9 reports: Space Radar Laboratory scientists received some images of Japan, near the location of Monday nights earthquake, but any evidence of the natural disaster was not immediately noticeable. Other radar observations during the night included studies of other volcanoes including Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines, Cotopaxi in Ecuador, and Teide in the Canary Islands. Radar images processed on the ground included images of Pasadena, California, with sufficient clarity make the Rose Bowl distinguishable, as well as images of Washington State and Yellowstone National Park, both showing scars from forest fires. During the night, the crew reported a missing thermal tile around one of the overhead windows of the orbiter. The tile apparently came off recently since crew members look out the window often to perform the visual observations that accompany radar operations. Flight controllers report that, while the tile is missing, the underlying thermal blanket is still intact. Astronaut Linda Godwin, who served as the payload commander on the first Space Radar Laboratory mission in April, briefed the crew from the payload control room about 4:30 am Wednesday, commemorating the tenth anniversary of Challenger's 41-G mission, which carried the Spaceborne Imaging Radar (SIR-B) and the Measurement of Air Pollution by Satellite (MAPS). She also noted the first flight aboard a Shuttle of that radar-imaging equipment on Columbia in November 1981. On Wednesday, 5 October 1994 at 4 pm CDT, STS-68 MCC Status Report # 10 reports: Mission to Planet Earth observations by Endeavour's payload bay radar instruments were being suspended temporarily Wednesday afternoon to save fuel while flight controllers work to fix a minor problem involving the shuttle's small reaction control system jets. One of the small rocket engines which help control the pointing of the Shuttle was turned off because of a temperature sensor problem. That caused all of the vernier jets, used for delicate pointing control, to be turned off and the larger steering jets to be used. The flight control team late Wednesday decided to allow the Shuttle's pointing to vary over a wider range to save thruster fuel while the initial problem was being addressed. A software change which will disregard the failed temperature sensor should be in place within 24 hours. Radar operations will be resumed once the update is made. The radar instruments earlier Wednesday collected images over the Kliuchevskoi volcano in Kamchatka, Russia, which erupted about 8 hours after Endeavour's launch Friday. Images also were collected over Yellowstone National Park, Wyo.; Chickasha, Okla.; Ruiz, Columbia; Cuprito, Nevada; Colima, Mexico; the Galapagos Islands and San Juan, Argentina. Observations with the Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellite were taken, with one particular target being line fires in British Columbia, Canada. On Thursday, 6 October 1994 at 8 am CDT, STS-68 MCC Status Report # 11 reports: Endeavour's small steering jets are now back in continuous operation and Space Radar Laboratory observations are continuing on schedule after Mission Control sent a software update to the shuttle about 3:30 am today. The software patch accommodated a failed temperature sensor in one of the vernier jets and allows Endeavour's onboard computers to track the operation of the jet via a second sensor located near the failed sensor. While the patch was being developed and tested in simulators, observations by the Space Radar Laboratory continued at a reduced pace. These small jets were used only when Mission Control had solid, stable communications with the orbiter when ground controllers could monitor the jet firings. The jets were turned off when communications with the shuttle were unavailable or intermittent, a common occurrence during standard shuttle operations. The observations using the radar systems that were missed while the software patch was being put in place, had been performed at least once previously during the mission and are scheduled for observation again later in the flight. SRL scientists say the impact of the temporary pause is minimal on the scientific investigations under way. One observation completed during the night was of a controlled oil spill in the North Sea designed to test the radar's ability to discern oil spills from the naturally produced film caused by fish and plankton in the water. In addition to the 106 gallons of diesel oil placed in the water, 26 gallons of algae products were placed in the water nearby for radar comparison. The ground team expected to have the oil spill cleaned up within about two hours using oil-recovery ships in the area. The experiment was conducted to prove the usefulness of radar systems to more rapidly detect spills allowing quicker cleanup. On Thursday, 6 October 1994 at 5 pm CDT, STS-68 MCC Status Report # 12 reports: Endeavour's astronauts this afternoon sent down spectacular videotape views of the west coast of California recorded as the shuttle passed about overhead on its 103rd orbit. The scenes covered the San Joaquin Valley, San Francisco Bay, Monterey Bay, Los Angeles, Vandenberg Air Force Base and San Diego Bay. During the next few days, scientists will test a new technique called \\"interferometry\\" as the earth observations data collection continues. The technique is expected to yield topographic information of unprecedented clarity by using slightly different shuttle positions to provide three-dimensional images of the terrain below. Among the Space Radar Laboratory observations today were the North Sea, where scientists intentionally released small oil and algae spills to see how well the SRL-2 instruments could track them, as well as observations of Bebedouro, Brazil; the Western and Northeast Pacific Ocean; Chickasha, Oklahoma; the Gulf of Mexico; Ruiz, Colombia; Sena Madureira, Brazil; Weddell Sea; the Kliuchevskoi Volcano in Kamchatmka; Stovepipe Wells, California; and the Galapagos Islands. Earlier today, the Mission Management Team extended STS-68 by one day to allow additional science. Endeavour is now expected to land at the Kennedy Space Center at about 10:36 am Tuesday. The orbiter continues to perform well. The only problem reported during the day was the failure of a primary reaction control system jet. The jet problem is not expected to have any effect on the mission since the orbiter has two other jets thrusting in the same direction. On Friday, 7 October 1994 at 8 am CDT, STS-68 MCC Status Report # 13 reports: Observations made during the night included the volcano Merapi on the Indonesian island of Java; Duke Forest in North Carolina; the Gulf of St. Lawrence; Sydney, Australia; and the volcano Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines. Tom Jones, the Payload Commander for this second flight of SRL, spent some time this morning explaining the importance of the radar's volcanic studies. Demonstrating with three common types of volcanic rock, Jones explained how the radar's various frequencies allow it to map lava and ash flows around volcanoes. The work one day may lead to a permanent radar platform in orbit for use in assisting predictions of impending volcanic eruptions and safeguarding people living near active volcanoes. Late Thursday, Endeavour's astronauts sent down spectacular views of the west coast of California recorded as the shuttle passed about overhead on its 103rd orbit. The scenes included the San Joaquin Valley, San Francisco, Monterey Bay, Los Angeles, Vandenberg Air Force Base and San Diego. On Friday, 7 October 1994 at 5 pm CDT, STS-68 MCC Status Report # 14 reports: Astronauts aboard Endeavour and Space Radar Laboratory-2 scientists on the ground today began in earnest to test the new technique of \\"interferometry\\" to produce even richer images of the Earth's surface. From an altitude of , the Spaceborne Imaging Radar and Synthetic Aperture Radar recorded long swaths of interferometric data over central North America, the Amazon forests of central Brazil, and the volcanoes of the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia. This morning, Endeavour's orbit was lowered from to support a new technique called \\"interferometry.\\" The technique is expected to yield topographic information of unprecedented clarity by using slightly different shuttle positions to provide three-dimensional images of the terrain below. The Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellite experiment also continues to function well, and the crew's infrared film, used to provide complementary still images of fires investigated by MAPS, has been expended. Controlled \\"line fires\\" in Ontario, Canada, were set as planned and observed by the crew in an effort to help calibrate the MAPS measurements. On Saturday, 8 October 1994 at 5 am CDT, STS-68 MCC Status Report # 15 reports: As Endeavour's seventh mission in space reaches the home stretch, scientific observations turn to the gathering of near three-dimensional views of various sites around the world to better understand climatic changes. The six crew members discussed the mission and the future of radar observations of the Earth during a news conference this morning. The radar array aboard the shuttle began a series of observations above volcanoes, glaciers and other sites designed to create 3-D images. These spaceborne radar images, produced regularly on a long-term basis, eventually could provide scientists with insight into movements of the Earth's surface as small as a fraction of an inch. Such close monitoring may allow scientists to detect pre-eruptive changes in volcanoes and movements in fault lines that precede earthquakes, providing an early warning of imminent natural hazards. Other future applications could include tracking the rate of global warming by monitoring the movement of glaciers and the tracking of floods and mudslides. Earlier this morning, Mission Specialist Dan Bursch took a break from his work to provide a television tour of the crew's orbital home office, explaining the shuttle's displays, controls, computers and cameras, as well as living accommodations. On Sunday, 9 October 1994 at 9 am CDT, STS-68 MCC Status Report # 16 reports: It has seemed like deja vu on board Endeavour as the crew spent much of the last 24 hours precisely repeating many Space Radar Laboratory observations to provide scientists with duplicate images for highly accurate three-dimensional maps of volcanoes, glaciers and other phenomena. Overnight, Mission Specialists Jeff Wisoff and Steve Smith replaced one of three payload recorders which malfunctioned yesterday. The procedure, which the two astronauts trained for prior to the mission, was completed in about an hour and a half. Although only two of the payload high data rate recorders were functioning, the planned observations by the radar lab were not interrupted. The two recorders alone were sufficient for retaining the radar data obtained during the overnight shift of astronauts Smith, Dan Bursch and Tom Jones. Small engine firings by Endeavour late yesterday aligned the spacecraft's trajectory to within an estimated of what had been planned when the spacecraft's orbit was lowered on Friday. This permits the precise repeat observations by the radar. During the night, Bursch and Smith took a break from their environmental studies to talk with KGO Radio in San Francisco. The interview included phone-in questions from area children. On Monday, 10 October 1994 at 10 am CDT, STS-68 MCC Status Report # 16 reports: In low Earth orbit, Endeavour's systems are being checked out today to ensure they are healthy and ready to support landing Tuesday. The flight control surfaces will be tested using one of the hydraulic systems called an Auxiliary Power Unit, and ground station communications checks will be done. Interferometry data gathering with the radar instruments in the orbiter's payload bay continued throughout the night and morning prior to the scheduled deactivation of the X- band Synthetic Aperture Radar. Interferometry will allow scientists to overlay radar images of the same site taken on successive days forming a three- dimensional image of the Earth's surface. These topographical images can be used to create a baseline used to understand the changes in the environmental and ecological climate around the world.

He also holds an Italian passport as his ancestor came from Ripa Teatina. He is currently a manager with Linense. Club career Brazil J√∫lio S√©rgio was signed by Brazilian club Am√©rica (SP) until the end of Campeonato Paulista in January 2006. Roma He signed a 1+3 year contract with Italian club Roma in July 2006, earning a gross salary of ‚Ç¨260,000 as part of the deal. Due to an injury to first choice goalkeeper Doni and poor performances by backup Artur, J√∫lio S√©rgio made his debut in Serie A on 30 August 2009 against Juventus, a game which Roma lost 1‚Äì3 and a defeat that lead to the resignation of Roma coach Luciano Spalletti. Despite this, J√∫lio S√©rgio was preferred by new head coach Claudio Ranieri in his first game in-charge in a 2‚Äì1 away win at Siena on 13 September. Strong performances ensured Julio S√©rgio more regular football and ultimately allowed him to become the new first choice keeper for the Giallorossi. He saved a key penalty from Sergio Floccari during the Rome derby against Lazio, which Roma ultimately won 2‚Äì1. Roma was losing 1‚Äì0 before the penalty, and J√∫lio S√©rgio's save was defined by head coach Claudio Ranieri as the turning point of the game. On 31 May 2010, he signed a new contract with the club, keeping him in the capital until 2014. His gross salary was increased to ‚Ç¨1.3 million per year in the first year and ‚Ç¨1.4 million in the second and the third, then ‚Ç¨700,000 in the final year. After Roma appointed new coach Vincenzo Montella, Doni returned to the side's starting XI. After a change in management and new ownership of AS Roma, and as the club had already signed Gianluca Curci in June, J√∫lio S√©rgio and Doni, left the club shortly before the start of the 2011‚Äì12 Serie A season. Lecce J√∫lio S√©rgio signed a season-long deal loan with Lecce in 2011. He played only seven games in first part of the season, partially because of his problem with injuries. From November 2011, Massimiliano Benassi served as first-choice, relegating J√∫lio S√©rgio to the substitutes' bench. Third-choice Ugo Gabrieli also played when both Benassi and J√∫lio S√©rgio were sidelined. He shortly returned to first choice in the penultimate match before the winter break, as J√∫lio S√©rgio recovered in time but Benassi did not. However, he was replaced by Gabrieli in the first half. After the winter break, J√∫lio S√©rgio was on the bench while Benassi was the starting goalkeeper in the first match against Juventus. Return to Roma J√∫lio S√©rgio returned to Roma in July 2012 and refused to leave the club; as such, he was omitted from the first-team squad by manager Zdenƒõk Zeman. He was originally included in the squad for AS Roma's 2012‚Äì13 season as the fourth-choice goalkeeper for then manager Rudi Garcia. However, he was released from the club on 4 December 2013 and became a free agent.

She is known for her landscape paintings as well as for several series of pen-and-ink drawings and etchings that were published in book form. She was the second woman to be elected an associate of the National Academy of Design, following Ann Hall. Family and education Eliza Pratt was born in Manorhamilton, Ireland, the daughter of James Calcott Pratt, a Methodist minister. The family moved to New York in 1840, where in 1849 she married Henry Wellington Greatorex, a musician. They had three children: two daughters, Elizabeth Eleanor and Kathleen Honora ‚Äî both of whom would grow up to become artists ‚Äî and a son, Thomas, who is said to have died in Colorado, possibly during her 1873 trip. Between 1854 and 1856, she studied art with the painters William Wallace Wotherspoon and James Hart and his brother William in New York, and by 1855 she had begun exhibiting sketches. However, it was only when Greatorex was widowed in 1858 that she was able to pursue art full-time, and she subsequently supported herself and her children through sales of her art and through teaching for 15 years at a girls' school. In 1861‚Äì62, she studied with the painter √âmile Lambinet outside Paris. In 1870, she traveled to Germany with her daughters and they studied at the Pinakothek in Munich. In 1879, dissatisfied with commercial reproductions of her work, she went to Paris to study engraving with Charles Henri Toussaint. From then on, she and her daughters were based out of Paris. Homes of Oberammergau Bay of Naples, Italy, etching by Eliza Pratt Greatorex Art career Greatorex first became known as a landscape painter of the Hudson River School. She often worked en plein air, and her landscapes reflect her careful observation of her environment. Her best-known paintings are View on the Houstonic (1863), The Forge (1864), and Somerindyke House (1869). One series of paintings was executed on panels taken from specific churches; these include Bloomingdale Church and The North Dutch Church (painted on panels taken from the North Dutch Church on Fulton Street in New York City) and St. Paul's Church, painted on a panel taken from that church. A house on the Hudson, Washington Heights View of Florence, 1886, from Maiano, (Italy) After a few years, Greatorex turned away from painting and devoted herself primarily to pen-and-ink sketches and etchings, many of which appeared in book form. The bulk of her sketches were made during several trips to Europe in the 1860s and 1870s and tend toward conventional views of buildings and landscapes. In 1870‚Äì1872, she visited Nuremberg and Ober- Ammergau, Germany; Munich, Austria; and various parts of Italy. The Nuremberg and Ober-Ammergau trips led to the publication of Etchings in Nuremberg (1873) and The Homes of Ober-Ammergau (1873). Her large pen-and-ink drawing of Albrecht Durer's house in Nuremberg is now in the Vatican in Rome. In the summer of 1873, she traveled around the western United States with her daughters and published a series of etchings from her sojourn in Colorado. The preface was written by Sara Jane Lippincott. With an eye to America's upcoming centennial, Greatorex published a book of drawings of old New York buildings in 1875, with a commentary by her sister Matilda. Some of the sketches from this series were included in the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. In 1868 she was elected an associate of the National Academy of Design, becoming the second woman to receive that recognition after Ann Hall, who had died some six years earlier. She was also a member of the Artists' Fund Society of New York. During the 1870s and 1880s, she frequently exhibited her work at the Paris Salon, the National Academy of Design (New York), and at venues in Washington and Boston. She died in Paris in 1897 and is buried on the Moret-sur-Loing cemetery. Greatorex's work was included in a 2010 exhibition by the Thomas Cole National Historical Site and Hawthorne Fine Art entitled Remember the Ladies: Women of the Hudson River School.

It is northwest of the small community of Telegraph Creek and just southwest of Callison Ranch. With a maximum elevation of , it rises above the surrounding landscape on the Nahlin Plateau, which is part of the western Stikine Plateau. Heart Peaks has been an area of prospecting since the 1980s with the discovery of precious metals. Situated in a large area of volcanic activity, Heart Peaks consists of a large shield volcano. It was formed in the past 23 million years by repeated eruptions of lava and rock. However, present day eruptions have not been observed. A number of related volcanoes are adjacent to Heart Peaks and form an extensive volcanic zone over long. The knowledge of Heart Peaks is limited, especially its eruptive history. Geology and geography Setting Heart Peaks is part of the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, a long volcanic chain extending from just north of the city of Prince Rupert in British Columbia through Yukon to the Alaska border. Along this line, the North American Plate has been rupturing. Earth's lithosphere consists of several large tectonic plates, which slowly move towards and away from one another, either converging and subducting or diverging and rifting; volcanoes and earthquakes are generated by these activities. The west coast of North America is the site of plate margins between the large Pacific and North American plates, and also between the smaller Juan de Fuca and Cocos plates. Tectonic activity along the North Coast of British Columbia and Southeast Alaska is characterized by transform movements of the Queen Charlotte Fault, a plate boundary where the Pacific Plate skids by the North American Plate. As the Pacific Plate moves northward to the Aleutian subduction zone, it generates rifting in the North American continent. Magma rises along cracks created by the rifting, and eventually erupts on the surface to form a volcano. This geological process has, over time, created the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, which is the most volcanically active area in Canada. However, most of the volcanoes have not been directly dated or have not been dated in sufficient detail to recognize how active they are, making the prediction of volcanic events difficult and volcanic hazards uncertain. Structure The nearly oval-shaped Heart Peaks shield volcano is made of basalt and trachybasalt with a composite thickness up to ; pyroclastic rocks are also present. It lies just west of the much larger Level Mountain shield and southwest of the Kawdy volcanoes. A series of steep-sided lava domes composed of porphyritic rhyolite and minor trachyte are situated on the western flank of Heart Peaks and display colours such as light green and pink. Rhyolitic lava domes are also present on its summit. The shield is surrounded by tributaries of the Inkin River, which flows northwest into the Taku River. A satellite photo of Heart Peaks (upper-left corner) and nearby Level Mountain (middle). This image clearly shows the large contrast in size between the two volcanoes. Heart Peaks is at least long and no more than wide at its base. The west and east flanks of the volcano are dissected, giving it a rugged appearance. However, its north flank is rounded and relatively smooth while its south flank is rather pointed. The highest elevation of Heart Peaks is at a small peak roughly in the middle of its summit plateau while the regional elevation of the Nahlin Plateau is . This indicates that Heart Peaks has a topographic prominence of at least . More than 20 unnamed creeks flow from the volcano, which drain into the nearby Dudidontu and Sheslay rivers. With an area of about and a volume of less than , Heart Peaks is the third-largest volcano in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, exceeded by the Mount Edziza and Level Mountain shields, which cover more than . Heart Peaks is over five times larger than the Mount Meager massif in southwestern British Columbia, the largest stratovolcano by volume in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. The area surrounding Heart Peaks is largely undeveloped, with Callison Ranch being the only locality. Vegetation at the volcano is present mainly on its flanks as its broad summit consists of a rocky plateau. Because of its remote location, Heart Peaks is accessed by helicopter from the small communities of Atlin and Dease Lake. Eruptive history Background Heart Peaks from the north. The Dudidontu River is in the lower-left corner and the Sheslay River is in the upper-right corner along the Coast Mountains. Little is known about the eruptive history of Heart Peaks because it has not been studied in detail by scientists. The exact age of Heart Peaks is not known, but its first volcanic phase occurred during the Neogene period (between 23 and 2.5 million years ago). The variety of volcanic deposits at Heart Peaks indicates that it has a history of producing not only fluid and passive basaltic lava flows, but also more silica-rich trachyte and rhyolitic lavas and explosive eruptions. Phreatic breccias are found at the volcano, providing evidence that phreatic eruptions have occurred at least once throughout its eruptive history. Features created by subglacial eruptions are also present. The latest volcanic phase at Heart Peaks is largely Pleistocene (between 2.5 million and 10,000 years ago) in age and late-stage Holocene (10,000 years ago to present) activity is uncertain. This is partly because it is unknown whether Holocene volcanic rocks exist at the volcano. Nevertheless, the last eruption at Heart Peaks is unknown. Finlay tephras Heart Peaks is one of the four volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province suggested to have erupted the Finlay tephras. These are situated throughout northwestern British Columbia and likely extend east into the Canadian Rockies. In the Finlay River and Dease Lake areas, two tephra deposits are situated between sand, silt, mud and gravel. They are both phonolitic to trachytic in composition and high in iron(II) oxide, indicating that the tephras were possibly erupted from a single volcano. Regional plant macrofossils immediately overlying the youngest Finlay tephra deposit are and radiocarbon years old. This indicates that the Finlay tephras are Early Holocene in age and were deposited shortly after the regional Fraser Glaciation retreated. The Finlay tephras are largely composed of elements most similar to those of Hoodoo Mountain, a flat-topped volcano that formed subglacially at least 100,000 years ago. Two phonolitic lava flows on its south flank were erupted between 10,000 and 9,000 years ago and remain unglaciated. They have a similar chemistry to the glass composition of the Finlay tephras. However, no tephras or pyroclastic rocks have been found at Hoodoo Mountain that were erupted the same time as these lava flows. Therefore, other possible sources have been proposed. At the Mount Edziza volcanic complex, basalts of probable Late Pleistocene to Early Holocene age have been found, but their exact ages and chemical compositions are not well known. Because Heart Peaks and nearby Level Mountain have been poorly studied and it is unknown if they contain Holocene age volcanic rocks, they are also possible sources for the Finlay tephras. Human history Naming The name Heart Mountains was adopted in the BC Gazetteer of 1930 with coordinates placing the massif at . Subsequently, it was renamed to Heart Peaks on May 6, 1947 and coordinates improved to . The name origins are unknown as they have not been recorded. A number of other mountain features in British Columbia also had their name changed in 1947, such as the Rainbow Range, which was originally named Rainbow Mountains. The name Heart Peaks officially refers to two small peaks situated on top of the shield volcano, located at . Because the shield volcano consists of a single landmass and the name Heart Peaks was officially given for two peaks on its summit, it is sometimes known as Heart Peak to avoid confusion. Heart Peaks is also known as HP in scientific documents and on geologic maps. Mineral explorations Heart Peaks seen from the west. Mineral explorations have occurred at the circular feature at the bottom centre of this image. The western flank of Heart Peaks has been an area of mineral exploration since 1980. A series of gold-bearing quartz veins were discovered in 1980 within a zone of argillic alteration covering an area of more than . In 1982, a number of geochemical soil surveys were carried out, as well as insufficient hand trenching and scree and rock sampling. In 1983, very low frequency electromagnetic surveys completed of surveying in the area. Exploration diamond drilling in 1984 resulted in the creation of eight widely spaced drill holes while an undocumented diamond drill program created two holes in 1987. Explorations did not resume until 1996 when the United States Diamond Corporation carried out heavy mineral silt sampling and a test induced polarization survey; two diamond drill holes were also created. All of these mineral explorations took place in the Heart Peaks property, which covers an area of . It consists of seven mineral claims entirely owned by Colorado Resources Ltd. A north trending graben structure long and wide intersects the property. Monitoring Like other volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, Heart Peaks is not monitored closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active its magma system is. This is partly because it is located in a remote region and no major eruptions have taken place in Canada in the past few hundred years. As a result, volcano monitoring is less important than dealing with other natural processes, including tsunamis, earthquakes and landslides. No recent earthquakes are known to have occurred at Heart Peaks. If it were to erupt there would likely be weeks, months or years of warning signs, such as clusters of minor earthquakes that would likely originate less than below the surface. They are generally too small to be felt by people, but the existing network of seismographs has been established to monitor tectonic earthquakes. However, the seismograph network is too far away to provide a good indication of what is happening under the mountain. It may sense an increase in seismic activity if the volcano becomes very restless, but this may only provide a warning for a significant eruption. It might detect activity only once the volcano has started erupting.

He was a nephew of St. John of Damascus and spent a half-century in the monastery of Mar Saba. He is venerated as a saint in the Orthodox Church. Stephen lived the ascetic life at the Lavra of Saint Sabas in Palestine. Stephen was introduced to the monastic life by his uncle, and, at the age of ten, entered the same monastic community as his uncle, St. John Damascene. By his mid-twenties, he felt so drawn to a life of seclusion and contemplation, he asked the abbot of the community for permission to live as a hermit. Due to the great skill in giving spiritual direction he already showed at that young age, the abbot gave him limited permission. The condition was that he make himself available to others on weekends./ Saint of the Day Towards the end of his life, Stephen reported that various cities, Gaza among them, were laid waste to and depopulated by the Saracens (another name for the Muslim Caliphate under the rule of the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties, referenced in Acta martyrum Sabaitarum, AASS Mart. III, p. 167). On this occasion many monks of St. Sabas met their deaths. He and Andrew the Blind were among the first to compose hymns (idiomela) in the Triodion (the liturgical book used during Great Lent), chanted during the period between the Sunday of the Publican and Pharisee and Palm Sunday. These idiomela are stichera of which two were written for each weekday of Great Lent. One is chanted at the aposticha of Vespers and one at the aposticha of Matins, each being chanted twice. The idiomela are \\"exceptionally rich in doctrinal content, summing up the whole theology of the Great Fast\\". The events of the time are recorded in the writings of Leontius in his book The Life of St. Stephen the Sabaite.

It is the highest peak in the Ha-Iltzuk Icefield, which is the largest icefield in the Coast Mountains south of the Alaska Panhandle. Geology Mount Silverthrone is an eroded lava dome on the northeast edge of a large caldera complex called the Silverthrone Caldera. It lies within the Coast Plutonic Complex, which is the single largest contiguous granite outcropping in the world. The plutonic and metamorphic rocks extend approximately 1,800 kilometers on the coast of British Columbia, southwestern Yukon and southeastern Alaska. In addition, Garibaldi, Meager, Cayley and Silverthrone areas are of recent volcanic origin. The volcanic terrain in the Silverthrone area is very similar to the Mount Meager massif further south. However, there is much more ice. Mount Silverthrone is perhaps one of the most heavily glaciated volcanic peaks in southwestern British Columbia. It has a topographic prominence of approximately , greater than any other volcano in southwestern British Columbia. The extensive icefields around Mount Silverthrone are receding and are small compared to their former extent, but they are an impressive indication of how much of British Columbia looked 10,000 years or more ago. Silverthrone contains one of the few calderas buried beneath the ice caps of western Canada, another example being Mount Edziza in far northwestern British Columbia. Skiing and recreation The first mountaineering visit at Mount Silverthrone was by the famous pioneering climbing group of Don and Phyllis Munday in 1936 by walking up the Klinaklini Glacier from the head of Knight Inlet. Because Silverthrone is heavily glaciated, Don Munday called the mountain \\"home of the snows\\".Ha-Iltzuk Icefield in the Canadian Mountain Encyclopedia.

The Act prohibits aggressive solicitation of persons in certain public places. It also prohibits the disposal of \\"certain dangerous things\\" such as used condoms, hypodermic needles and broken glass in outdoor public places. It also amends the Highway Traffic Act to regulate certain activities on roadways. The Act was enacted by the Progressive Conservative government of Mike Harris and received royal assent on December 14, 1999. The Act was created in response to what was seen as the growing problem of squeegee kids on the streets. By 1999, it was very common to see squeegee kids on some of the busiest intersections where they would solicit motorists for spare change. The Act was affirmed by the Ontario Court of Appeal on a constitutional challenge after the Ontario Superior Court also upheld its validity in 2005. The Supreme Court of Canada has denied an application for review. In 2004, the province of British Columbia passed its own version of the Safe Streets Act, substantially a word-for-word copy of the Ontario version.  Criticism  The Act has been criticized by many anti-poverty groups such as OCAP (Ontario Coalition Against Poverty) for being too strict and too vague in how it defines aggressive panhandling. The bill states that \\"aggressive manner\\" means \\"a manner that is likely to cause a reasonable person to be concerned for his or her safety or security.\\" This could mean almost anything as different people have different standards for when their own safety has been compromised. The Act has also been criticized by The Homeless Hub, which argues that it is bad policy and practice for reasons including that issuing tickets to homeless people is a counter-productive way of dealing with a poverty issue, as homeless persons cannot pay SSA fines, and that the Safe Streets Act is not cost-effective. The Act was protested by a group of one hundred homeless in May 2006 in Ottawa who mostly identified themselves as anarchists.

The parish is located on the lower North Shore of Sydney and has two ministry centres in Cammeray and Naremburn. The Church's vision is that \\"By God‚Äôs grace, we seek to see lives saved through knowing Christ\\". History In post-World War I Sydney, there was an upsurge in church construction, among which were Naremburn and Cammeray. These two existed as separate parishes in their early decades. Throughout the 1950s, '60s and '70s the Parish of St Cuthbert's Naremburn and the Parish of All Saints' Cammeray were busy. In those days, the Sunday Schools had 350 children attending each Sunday and St Cuthbert's won 3 cricket premierships in the local competition. In the late 1970s a decision was made to join the two parishes. At that time, there were four churches, three halls, and two rectories. By 1997, two of the churches had been disposed of, the three halls had been demolished, the two rectories had been sold, and a new one had been built on site. A church plant from St Thomas North Sydney led by Rick Smith resulted in the attendance and congregation size reversing quite radically, and by 2013 NCA had nine congregations and a normal Sunday attendance of over 600. In 2008, the Naremburn building was deemed too small and run down to cater for the ongoing expansion of ministry and building work began on a new Naremburn Ministry Centre. This work was completed in late 2009, and the facilities are extensively used every day. During 2010, Willoughby Council awarded the parish a commendation in the Council's heritage awards through the parish's commitment to protect the heritage values of the original church by recognizing the nature of new uses. After the success of the redevelopment of the Naremburn building, in 2016 the parish commenced the redevelopment of its Cammeray building. The new building was completed in June 2017. Present There are currently 5 services each Sunday: * 8am Naremburn * 9am Cammeray * 10am Naremburn * 4pm SJEC @ Naremburn * 6pm Naremburn Sydney Japanese Evangelical Church The Sydney Japanese Evangelical Church (SJEC) meet at Naremburn from 3 pm each Sunday. In April 2009, Grahame and Cathy Smith were inducted as the new ministers of this congregation. They spent the previous 18 years in Japan serving as missionaries with CMS. An article appeared in the May 2009 issue of Southern Cross, the magazine of the Anglican Diocese of Sydney, profiling the SJEC ministry.

Olympia was later to become the mother of the famous Austrian general Prince Eugene of Savoy. She also involved herself in various court intrigues including the notorious Poison Affair, which led to her expulsion from France. Family and early years Olympia Mancini was born on 11 July 1638 and grew up in Rome. Her father was Baron Lorenzo Mancini, an Italian aristocrat who was also a necromancer and astrologer. After his death in 1650, her mother, Geronima Mazzarini, brought her daughters from Rome to Paris in the hope of using the influence of her brother, Cardinal Mazarin, to gain them advantageous marriages. The other Mancini sisters were: * Laura Mancini (1636‚Äì1657), the eldest, who married Louis de Bourbon, Duke of Vend√¥me, the grandson of King Henry IV and his mistress, Gabrielle d'Estr√©es. * Marie Mancini (1639‚Äì1715), the third sister, was considered the least beautiful of the sisters but she obtained the biggest prize of all: Louis XIV. He was so besotted with her that he wanted to marry her but he was constrained to give her up for political reasons. She later married Prince Lorenzo Colonna who remarked that he was surprised to find her a virgin as one does not expect to find 'innocence among the loves of kings'. (from Antonia Fraser's book Love and Louis XIV) * Hortense Mancini (1646‚Äì1699), the beauty of the family, escaped her abusive husband, Armand Charles de la Porte, Duke of La Meilleraye, and went to London, where she became the mistress of King Charles II. * Marie Anne Mancini (1649‚Äì1714) married Maurice Godefroy de La Tour d'Auvergne, Duke of Bouillon, a nephew of the famous field marshal Turenne. The Mancinis were not the only female family members that Cardinal Mazarin brought to the French court. The others were Olympia's first cousins, daughters of Mazarin's eldest sister. The elder, Laura Martinozzi, married Alfonso IV d'Este, Duke of Modena and was the mother of Mary of Modena, second wife of James II of England. The younger, Anne Marie Martinozzi, married Armand, Prince de Conti. The Mancini also had three brothers: Paul, Philippe, and Alphonse. Jacob van Schuppen's portrait of Olympia's son, Prince Eugene of Savoy Marriage Olympia was married on 24 February 1657 to Prince Eug√®ne-Maurice of Savoy (1633‚Äì1673), by whom she had eight children, amongst whom was the famous soldier Prince Eugene of Savoy. At court, the Count of Soissons (comte Soissons) was addressed as Monsieur le Comte. As his wife, Olympia was referred to at court as Madame la comtesse.  Intrigues  Soon after her sister Marie's marriage to Prince Colonna, Olympia was appointed Superintendent of the Queen's Household which gave her authority over and above that of all of the other ladies at Court with the exception of the Princesses of The Blood.Th√©r√®se Louis Latour \\"Princesses, Ladies and Adventuresses of The Reign of Louis XIV\\", page 196 Olympia was, by nature, an intrigante.Latou,pages 196‚Äì97 Shortly after her marriage, she became involved in various intrigues at Court. There were rumours that prior to her marriage, she was briefly the mistress of Louis XIV. While not exactly beautiful, Olympia was described as possessing great charm and indisputable fascination. Her hair was dark, her complexion brilliant, her eyes black and vivacious, and her figure plump and rounded.Latour, page, 194 After her marriage, she allied herself with Louis' sister-in-law, Henriette, Duchess of Orl√©ans, who was known at court as Madame, and with whom he had (allegedly) fallen deeply in love. Their relationship is highly unlikely to have been sexual, although the Queen Mother was deeply concerned about it.A. Fraser, Love and Louis XIV. See also L. Hilton, The Real Queen of France. When Henriette and Louis sought to hide their relationship from others, Olympia is said to have introduced one of Henriette's ladies-in-waiting, Louise, Mademoiselle de La Valli√®re, to the King so that he might claim that his attendance upon Henriette and her ladies was based on his affection for Louise and not Henriette. Olympia turned against Louise, however, after the King fell in love with the latter at the expense of Henrietta Anne.  The Affaire des Poisons  Olympia was accused in 1679 in the Affaire des Poisons of having plotted with La Voisin to poison Louise de La Valli√®re. She was even said to have threatened the King himself with the words, \\"come back to me, or you will be sorry\\". In addition, she was suspected of poisoning her own husband, and also on 12 February 1689 Queen Maria Luisa of Spain, the daughter of Henriette and niece of Louis XIV whose confidence she had gained after having taken up residence in Spain following her expulsion from France as a result of the Poison Affair.Latour, pages 203‚Äì04 Portrait of Olympia Mancini depicted as the goddess Athena.

Bone The lacunae are situated between the lamellae, and consist of a number of oblong spaces. In an ordinary microscopic section, viewed by transmitted light, they appear as fusiform opaque spots. Each lacuna is occupied during life by a branched cell, termed an osteocyte, bone-cell or bone-corpuscle. Lacunae are connected to one another by small canals called canaliculi. A lacuna never contains more than one osteocyte. Sinuses are an example of lacuna. Cartilage The cartilage cells or chondrocytes are contained in cavities in the matrix, called cartilage lacunae; around these, the matrix is arranged in concentric lines as if it had been formed in successive portions around the cartilage cells. This constitutes the so-called capsule of the space. Each lacuna is generally occupied by a single cell, but during the division of the cells, it may contain two, four, or eight cells.

Following Operation Blue Star, the assassination of Indira Gandhi and the 1984 Anti-Sikh Riots, the police were empowered to detain suspects for any reason, ostensibly as suspected terrorists. The police were accused of killing unarmed suspects in staged shootouts and burning thousands of dead bodies to cover up the murders.\\"Who Killed the Sikhs\\".

As per the CBI investigation records quoted by SC division bench in their judgement on the Khalra custodial death case, he was a human rights activist working on the abduction, elimination, and cremation of unclaimed human bodies during the disturbed period. The court observed that the police had been eliminating young persons under the pretext of being militants and disposing of their bodies without record.

The National Human Rights Commission released a list of some of the identified bodies that were cremated in the police districts of Amritsar, Majitha and Tarn Taran between June 1984 to December 1994. The Supreme Court of India and the National Human Rights Commission of India has certified the validity of this data. Jaswant Singh Khalra asserted there could have been over 25,000 Sikhs illegally killed and cremated by the state. There are still many Sikh families waiting to hear news of what happened to their missing loved ones, many wondering if they might still be alive. A list of names has been published by Tribune India. Murder and cover up On 6 September 1995, while washing his car in front of his house, Khalra was allegedly abducted by personnel of Punjab Police and taken to Jhabal Police Station. Although witnesses gave statements implicating the police and have named former police chief Kanwar Pal Singh Gill as a conspirator, police have denied ever arresting or detaining him and have claimed to have no knowledge of his whereabouts. In 1996, the Central Bureau of Investigation found evidence that he was held at a police station in Tarn Taran and recommended the prosecution of nine Punjab police officials for murder and kidnapping. Those accused of his murder were not charged for ten years, though one of the suspects senior superintendent of police Ajit Singh Sandhu was murdered in 1997 but his murder was staged as a suicide. On 18 November 2005, six Punjab police officials were convicted and sentenced to seven years imprisonment for Khalra's abduction and murder. On 16 October 2007, a division bench of Punjab and Haryana High Court, chaired by Justices Mehtab Singh Gill and A N Jindal, extended the sentence to life imprisonment for four accused: Satnam Singh, Surinder Pal Singh, Jasbir Singh (all former sub inspectors) and Prithipal Singh (former head constable).

Its official designation through most of its service was as the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, VI Corps. Beginnings and early service Through the course of the Civil War, the brigade was composed entirely of units from New Jersey, the only Union brigade during the war to be constituted as such. Its origins were on May 4, 1861, when New Jersey was directed by the Federal government to fill a quota of three infantry regiments to serve a three-year term of enlistment. Recruitment took place for the new regiments all over the state, and on May 21, 1861, the 1st New Jersey Volunteer Infantry was mustered into the Union Army at Camp Olden in Trenton, New Jersey, under Maj. Theodore T. S. Laidley of the United States Regular Army. The 1st New Jersey was then followed into Federal service by the 2nd New Jersey Volunteer Infantry (May 28, 1861) and the 3rd New Jersey Volunteer Infantry. On June 28, 1861, the three newly created three-year regiments began the journey to Virginia, where in June they were joined with a brigade of three-month enlistment New Jersey Militia regiments to form a division commanded by Brig. Gen. Theodore Runyon. This was the first time the New Jersey regiments officially formed the brigade. During the First Bull Run Campaign, most of the brigade saw service in the field guarding train hubs, supply depots and roadways, being considered too \\"green\\" to be reliable in combat. However, a few companies of the 1st and 2nd New Jersey Infantries were directed to help stem the retreat at Centreville, Virginia, after the Confederates routed General Irvin McDowell's forces at Manassas, Virginia, on July 21, 1861. They were unsuccessful, and many officers and men retreated in the route as well. In August 1861, the 4th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry was recruited and added to the First New Jersey Brigade after its muster into service. From that point on, the four regiments and their later remnants would serve together until the end of the war and their final discharge. Later service As the war progressed, more regiments were added to the brigade, but in keeping with its tradition, they were New Jersey units. In September 1862, the nine-month enlistment unit 23rd New Jersey Volunteer Infantry and the three-year 15th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry were added, with the 23rd New Jersey serving until June 1863 and the 15th New Jersey serving until the end of the war. On April 19, 1864, the 10th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry \\"Olden's Legion\\" was added. In March 1865 the 40th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry‚Äîthe last raised by the state‚Äîwas brigaded with the original units. The brigade saw its first pitched battle rather late, as it fought in the June 27, 1862, Battle of Gaines' Mill during the Seven Days Battles. There it sustained heavy casualties, with most of the 4th New Jersey being captured by Confederate forces. The 4th New Jersey's men were subsequently released in a prisoner exchange and returned to their lines, but they lost the Model 1861 Springfield Rifles they'd been carrying. Since none were available to rearm the regiment, they were issued old .69 caliber smoothbore muskets. It then fought in the Second Bull Run Campaign, where it blundered into the entire Confederate army corps commanded by Major General Stonewall Jackson, and at Crampton's Gap during the Battle of South Mountain, where it redeemed its honor by making a triumphant charge up the hill. The 4th New Jersey managed to reequip itself with .58 caliber rifles dropped by the Confederates. Later engagements included Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, Cold Harbor, Strasburg, Fisher's Hill, and Cedar Creek.

Gen. Philip Kearny, whose training and discipline molded the regiments into an effective fighting unit. He was succeeded by George W. Taylor, who was colonel of the 3rd New Jersey Infantry. Taylor was promoted to brigadier general soon after assuming command of the brigade. After being mortally wounded at the Second Battle of Bull Run, the leadership of the brigade went to Alfred Thomas Torbert, who was serving as colonel of the 1st New Jersey Infantry. Subsequent commanders were Col. Henry Brown (3rd New Jersey), Col. William H. Penrose (15th New Jersey), and Cpt. Baldwin Hufty (4th New Jersey).

He finished high school at Eerde, a boarding school in the Netherlands at age 16 and moved to the United States as an exchange student. He attended Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina. One of the first things he did upon arriving was look up his last name in the phone book. The only Einstein he found was a relative: Albert Einstein's son, Hans Albert Einstein. They became friends and he was often invited over whenever Albert visited. He earned his medical degree from New York Medical College in 1946 and did his internship at Paterson General Hospital in Paterson, New Jersey. Following that, he became a medical officer in the United States Army. He then completed residencies in Internal Medicine and Pulmonary Diseases at the New York Veterans Hospitals. In 1951, he drove across the United States to Kern General Hospital (now Kern Medical Center) in Bakersfield, California. After completing his residency, Einstein became the assistant medical director of the Kern County tuberculosis sanitarium in Keene. While there, he realized that some patients had Valley Fever rather than Tuberculosis. This spurred his lifelong study of the endemic disease Valley Fever which continued throughout his career. Einstein subsequently opened a private practice and co-founded a medical group in Bakersfield, specializing in Internal Medicine. While maintaining his private practice, he gave weekly lectures and led grand rounds at Los Angeles County+USC Medical Center starting in 1962. In 1978, Einstein was offered the Barlow Chair at USC, which he agreed to do for ten years. He closed his private practice and left Bakersfield to become Medical Director and CEO of Barlow Respiratory Hospital in Los Angeles, CA. He also was a physician and educator at the USC School of Medicine and even served on the Board of Directors for the hospital until 2012. While living in Los Angeles, he also spent time directing staff and education programs at Los Angeles Good Samaritan Hospital, served as President of the LA chapter of the American Lung Association for one year, and opened an early AIDS treatment center at Barlow Respiratory Hospital. In 1988, Einstein was offered the position of Medical Director at both Los Angeles Good Samaritan and Bakersfield Memorial Hospitals. He chose to move back to Bakersfield to be near his long-time friends, also promising them only ten years. He was Medical Director at Bakersfield Memorial Hospital until his retirement in 1999. After this, he continued treating patients at the Kern County Public Health Department's Tuberculosis Clinic. He also treated patients at the Valley Fever Clinic at Kern Medical Center, started the Respiratory Technician program at San Joaquin Valley College, taught at California State University Bakersfield, and established a need- and academic-based scholarship for pre-medical students at CSUB.

The album showcased an unorthodox combination of hardcore punk and jazz fusion. In an interview in May 2003, Kerrang! magazine described the band as \\"supermodels playing Dillinger Escape Plan\\". A new album, Pain Necessary to Know, was released in late 2005. After recording the album, drummer Davide Piovesan quit the band, and was replaced first by Sergio Ponti in 2006 and then by Andrea Rabuini in 2007. Ephel Duath later dismissed bassist Fabio Fecchio, with the band stating that they intended to remain a trio to \\"explore more experimental music dimensions\\".

From the band's departure from Earache until late 2011, Tiso was the sole member of Ephel Duath. He explained that this was due to the cost of hiring musicians out of his own pocket. He claimed to have received only $400 from his record label. Regarding how the financial difficulties affected the band, Tiso said that the former members of Ephel Duath \\"were often complaining, without even realizing how many problems I was hiding in front of their eyes. Now it's just me, and I'm pretty comfortable like this.\\" In November 2011, Tiso announced (via Facebook) that Ephel Duath signed with Agonia Records (Poland) for the release of an EP and two full-length albums. The EP, called On Death And Cosmos, was recorded in January 2012 at Sharkbyte Studios in Oakland, California, and released in summer 2012. Erik Rutan mixed the album at his Mana Recording Studio and Alan Douches mastered it at West West Side Music in New York. In December 2011, a new line-up was announced consisting of Karyn Crisis (Tiso's wife), Steve Di Giorgio and Marco Minnemann (who has previously worked with the band).

Laid down at Nikolayev South (Shipyard No.444), Leningrad was commissioned in late 1968. Preceded by Moskva, there were no further vessels built, reportedly due to the poor handling of the ships in rough seas. She was conventionally powered.  Design  The Moskvas were not true \\"aircraft carriers\\" in that they did not carry any fixed-wing aircraft; the air wing was composed entirely of helicopters. They were designed primarily as anti-submarine warfare (ASW) vessels, and her weapons and sensor suite was optimized against the nuclear submarine threat. Shipboard ASW armament included a twin SUW-N-1 launcher capable of delivering a FRAS-1 projectile carrying a 450 mm torpedo (or a 5 kiloton nuclear warhead); a pair of RBU-6000 ASW mortars; and a set of torpedo tubes. For self-defense, the Moskvas had two twin SA-N-3 SAM launchers with reloads for a total of 48 surface-to-air missiles, along with two twin 57 mm/80 guns. A \\"Mare Tail\\" variable depth sonar worked in conjunction with heliborne sensors to hunt submarines. A port-quarter fantail view of Leningrad. Their strategic role was to defend the Soviet ballistic missile submarine bastions against incursions by Western attack submarines, forming the flagships of an ASW task force.  Construction and service  Leningrad was laid down at the Black Sea Shipyard in Nikolayev with yard number 702 on 15 January 1965, launched on 31 July 1966, added to the list of ships of the Soviet Navy on 24 January 1967, and entered service on 2 June 1969. She became part of the Black Sea Fleet on 9 July of that year. Between 1 and 31 May 1970, 1 December 1971 and 30 June 1972, and 15 June and 6 December 1974 she cruised in the Mediterranean Sea to support Egyptian forces. Between 4 August and 14 October 1974 she was the flagship for the detachment of ships in the Suez Canal mine clearance operation. Between August and November 1984 she participated in minesweeping operations in the Red Sea, the Bab-el-Mandeb, and the Gulf of Aden. Between 31 May and 7 June 1990 she participated in short anti-submarine search exercises in the Mediterranean. Leningrad participated in the rescue operations for Soviet submarine K-19 in the North Atlantic between February and March 1972. In honor of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Union, the helicopter carrier was awarded an honorary jubilee badge by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. She made visits to Dakar between 19 and 23 November 1974, Split between 14 and 19 October 1976, Algiers between 27 September and 1 October 1981, and Havana between 26 and 30 March 1984. Between 12 May 1977 and 6 October 1978 and from 3 February 1986 to 11 December 1987 she was refitted at Sevmorzavod. With a hunting group, she was awarded the 1989 prize of the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Navy in the anti-aircraft category. On 24 June 1991 the helicopter carrier was removed from the navy after being transferred for disarmament and scrapping. On 5 December the crew was disband and on 24 August 1995 she was towed from Sevastopol to India for scrapping.

A site at Cessford Burn has the remains of an ancient farmstead attached to Cessford Castle in the historic county of Roxburghshire (now an administrative area of Scottish Borders Region), between Kelso and Morebattle, in the parish of Eckford. The extant foundation stones of the dwellings, which can be seen to this day, are situated on the north bank of the Cessford Burn. Seven shiels, or thatched cottages, once housed the families of the farm steward, the shepherd and the ploughman. The farmstead was burned to the ground by the English many times, including the border campaign of the Earl of Surrey in May, 1523 and again by the Earl of Hertford in 1545, and during the Rough Wooing of Mary, Queen of Scots, by Henry VIII of England. The families living in these shiels were in the service of the Kers of Cessford, latterly the Dukes of Roxburghe, who were granted by Royal Charters of both James I of Scotland and James II of Scotland, to hold these lands of the Crown. This encompassed Cessford (or Kerr) Castle, the dwellings at Cessford Burn, and the castleton of Cessford, lying just outside the north gate to the castle. Cessford Castle, in ruins today, stands upon the ridge opposite Cessford Burn on the south bank. The castleton is no longer extant, but aerial photographs and Matthew Stobie's 1770 map of Roxburghshire show that the village lay hard by the castle to the northwest on the Morebattle road; about 140 souls lived in Cessford village during those times. Along the quiet, green banks of Cessford Burn is Habbie Kerr's cave, where local citizens had sought safety and shelter since the fifth century CE. Just south of Cessford Castle, there once stood an ancient ash tree known as the \\"Crow Tree\\", where summary Jeddart Justice was carried out. A branch of the old Border family Nisbet were shepherds in Cessford Burn from about 1665 until they emigrated to Canada and New York in 1822, due to the farm consolidations of the late 18th century on the Scottish Borders.

It was first shown to break down anandamide in 1993. In humans, it is encoded by the gene FAAH.;  Function  FAAH is an integral membrane hydrolase with a single N-terminal transmembrane domain. In vitro, FAAH has esterase and amidase activity. In vivo, FAAH is the principal catabolic enzyme for a class of bioactive lipids called the fatty acid amides (FAAs). Members of the FAAs include: * Anandamide (N-arachidonoylethanolamine), an endocannabinoid *2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), an endocannabinoid. * Other N-acylethanolamines, such as N-oleoylethanolamine and N-palmitoylethanolamine * The sleep-inducing lipid oleamide * The N-acyltaurines, which are agonists of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of calcium channels. FAAH knockout mice display highly elevated (>15-fold) levels of N-acylethanolamines and N-acyltaurines in various tissues. Because of their significantly elevated anandamide levels, FAAH KOs have an analgesic phenotype, showing reduced pain sensation in the hot plate test, the formalin test, and the tail flick test. Finally, because of their impaired ability to degrade anandamide, FAAH KOs also display supersensitivity to exogenous anandamide, a cannabinoid receptor (CB) agonist. Due to the ability of FAAH to regulate nociception, it is currently viewed as an attractive drug target for the treatment of pain. A Scottish woman with a previously unreported genetic mutation (dubbed FAAH-OUT) in her FAAH gene with resultant elevated anandamide levels was reported in 2019 to be immune to anxiety, unable to experience fear, and insensitive to pain. The frequent burns and cuts she suffered due to her hypoalgesia healed quicker than average. A mutation in FAAH was initially provisionally linked to drug abuse and dependence but this was not borne out in subsequent studies. Studies in cells and animals and genetic studies in humans have shown that inhibiting FAAH may be a useful strategy to treat anxiety disorders.  Inhibitors and inactivators  Based on the hydrolytic mechanism of fatty acid amide hydrolase, a large number of irreversible and reversible inhibitors of this enzyme have been developed. Some of the more significant compounds are listed below; * AM374, palmitylsulfonyl fluoride, one of the first FAAH inhibitors developed for in vitro use, but too reactive for research in vivo * ARN2508, derivative of flurbiprofen, dual FAAH / COX inhibitor * BIA 10-2474 (Bial-Portela & Ca. SA, Portugal) has been linked to severe adverse events affecting 5 patients in a drug trial in Rennes, France, and at least one death, in January 2016. Many other pharmaceutical companies have previously taken other FAAH inhibitors into clinical trials without reporting such adverse events. * BMS-469908 * CAY-10402 * JNJ-245 * JNJ-1661010 * JNJ-28833155 * JNJ-40413269 * JNJ-42119779 * JNJ-42165279 in clinical trials against social anxiety and depression, trials suspended as a precautionary measure following serious adverse event with BIA 10-2474 * LY-2183240 * Cannabidiol * MK-3168 * MK-4409 * MM-433593 * OL-92 * OL-135 * PF-622 * PF-750 * PF-3845 * PF-04457845 \\"exquisitely selective\\" for FAAH over other serine hydrolases, but failed in clinical trials against osteoarthritis * PF-04862853 * RN-450 * SA-47 * SA-73 * SSR-411298 well tolerated in clinical trials but insufficient efficacy against depression, subsequently trialled against cancer pain as an adjunctive treatment. * ST-4068, reversible inhibitor of FAAH * TK-25 * URB524 * URB597 (KDS-4103, Kadmus Pharmaceuticals), is an irreversible inactivator with a carbamate-based mechanism, and appears in one report as a somewhat selective, though it also inactivates other serine hydrolases (e.g., carboxylesterases) in peripheral tissues. * URB694 * URB937 * VER-156084 (Vernalis) * V-158866 (Vernalis) in clinical trials for neuropathic pain following spinal injury, and spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis. Structure not revealed though Vernalis holds several patents in the area.  Inhibition and binding  Structural and conformational properties that contribute to enzyme inhibition and substrate binding imply an extended bound conformation, and a role for the presence, position, and stereochemistry of a delta cis double bond. Assays The enzyme is typically assayed making use of a radiolabelled anandamide substrate, which generates free labelled ethanolamine, although alternative LC-MS methods have also been described.  Structures  The first crystal structure of FAAH was published in 2002 (PDB code 1MT5). Structures of FAAH with drug-like ligands were first reported in 2008, and include non-covalent inhibitor complexes and covalent adducts.;  See also  * Endocannabinoid enhancer * Endocannabinoid reuptake inhibitor * Monoacylglycerol lipase * FAAH2  References   External links   Proteopedia FAAH entry - interactive structure (JMOL) of inhibitor-bound FAAH Category:EC 3.5.1 Category:Integral membrane proteins ","title":"Fatty acid amide hydrolase"},{"id":"7089668","text":"Adalbert I (died after 28 February 929) was the margrave of Ivrea, the second of the Anscarid dynasty, from the late 890s until his death. In the intermittent civil war which affected Italy from 888 into the 930s, Adalbert initially strove to remain neutral, but from 901 on he sided sequentially with every claimant to the Italian throne. He was a son of Margrave Anscar I, originally from Oscheret in Upper Burgundy. He succeeded his father at Ivrea between 896 and 900.Fasoli (1960). He initially refused to take sides after King Louis of Provence invaded Italy in 900, but after Louis's imperial coronation in 901 he recognised his authority. After Louis was defeated by his rival, Berengar I, in 902, Adalbert changed sides. Shortly thereafter, by 903 at the latest, he married Gisela of Friuli, Berengar's daughter, which was possibly the price of his allegiance. Although Adalbert is not recorded as being related to the king in any of Berengar's charters down through 14 August 908 and his marriage is not explicitly referenced before 13 June 910, it must have taken place some fifteen years before he and Gisela's eldest son was sent was granted a county and a missaticum in 918. With Gisela he had two children: Berengar, who succeeded him as margrave, and Bertha, who became abbess of Modena. Between 913 and 915 Gisela died and Adalbert married Ermengarde of Tuscany (901 ‚Äì 29 February 931/2), daughter of Margrave Adalbert II of Tuscany. From this marriage he had a second son, Anscar, later Duke of Spoleto. In 916‚Äì17 his primary concern was Saracen raids. In 920‚Äì21 he joined those noblemen, many of Burgundian origin like him, who supported the candidature of King Rudolf II of Burgundy for the Italian throne. Adalbert, with Lambert, Archbishop of Milan, and Count Gilbert of Bergamo, assembled a force in the mountains outside Brescia with the intention of marching on Verona and capturing Berengar there. When the latter got wind of the plan, he sent a troop of Magyar mercenaries to circle the conspirators and attack them from behind. In the midst of defeat, Adalbert swapped clothing with one of his soldiers and paid his own ransom at a low price. By late 921 Rudolf had entered Italy and been recognised as king in the march of Ivrea and the archdiocese of Milan. Although Adalbert made a few appearances at Rudolf's court in the early days, he never frequented it as often as did his wife and his two sons. After his relative Hugh ascended the Italian throne, Adalbert appearances in the records are sparse. He apparently played no role in Rudolf's deposition and Hugh's acclamation. He was probably gravely ill, since Liutprand of Cremona, writing in 924‚Äì25, already thought him dead. His last recorded action, probably shortly before he died, was a donation to the church of Saint Andrew in Turin, which was witnessed by King Hugh on 28 February 929.

From 1351 to 1554, the church was known as San Giovanni Evangelista, since the site had a small oratory dedicated to the saint. In the mid-16th century, Cosimo I applied the inheritance of a Giovanni di Lando of the neighboring Gori family to the erection of a church for the newly arrived Jesuits (1577). Construction began two years later on designs of Bartolommeo Ammannati, afterwards supplanted by Giulio Parigi and finally Alfonso Parigi il Giovane, who completed the work in 1661. The Jesuit Order was suppressed in 1775, and the church was passed to the Piarist or Scolopi Fathers. It was restored in 1843 by Leopoldo Pasqui.

This project looks beyond parallelization and focuses on domain-specific customization to achieve drastic power- performance efficiency improvement. It led to multiple innovations on architecture design, compilation, and runtime support for customized computing. This new line of research made considerable influence to the computing industry. In particular, Intel's $17 billion acquisition of Altera, the second largest FPGA company worldwide, in 2015 signaled that customizable computing is becoming mainstream.

He joined alternative rockers, You Am I, in 1993 on drums, percussion and backing vocals. He had previously been a member of the Bamboos (1986‚Äì87) and Kryptonics (1987‚Äì88). He established a record label, Reverberation, in 2003 with his former Kryptonics bandmate, Ian Underwood.  Biography  Early in 1981 in Perth, Hopkinson was the lead vocalist and guitarist for Circle A, which included Don Burr on lead guitar and the Tarrant brothers: Dan on bass guitar and John on drums. They disbanded before the end of the year while Hopkinson and Burr (now on bass guitar) formed Zoo Rejects in the following year with Sean Pickergill on guitar and vocals, and Craig Weighell on drums. However Hopkinson soon left and joined Genocide, on drums, by mid-1982, with Costa on lead vocals, Matthew Snashall on bass guitar and Craig Tobin on lead guitar. Hopkinson later recalled growing up in Fremantle, \\"I was really into punk rock. Being into punk rock in those days meant things could be pretty scary. I went to the same school that Bon Scott had been to, and we had a lot of run-ins while I was growing up. But there were lots of interesting people around ‚Äì Fremantle's a port town, so you tend to get an interesting mix.\\" In January 1983 Hopkinson, Snashall and Tobin were joined by Ken Knight on lead vocals to form Mob Vengeance. Tobin left in August and they continued with a new guitarist. Knight became a local promoter and later recalled, \\"[we] were one of the early Perth punk bands; there wasn't too many places we were actually able to play at the time. The West Australian public was a bit terrified of people with green and pink hair. We had a residency for a while with the Quick and the Dead, the big skinhead band at the time. We used to have to play in the daylight hours at the City Hotel.\\" In 1984 Hopkinson replaced founding drummer, Michael, in Melbourne-based hardcore punk outfit, Vicious Circle, alongside Alby Brovedani on bass guitar and guitar (ex-Politburo), Paul Lindsay on lead vocals and Les Rumincik on lead guitar (ex-Politburo). Their early recordings include two tracks, \\"Blood Race\\" and \\"Police Brutality\\", on various artists compilation album, Eat Your Head (1984). The debut album, The Price of Progress, followed in September 1985. Hopkinson left in April 1986 and was replaced by David Ross. Late in 1986 Hopkinson replaced Shakir Pichler on drums in Perth-based swamp rockers, the Bamboos, which included Greg Hitchcock on guitar (ex-Go Starts, Grave Robbers). They issued a single, \\"With Which to Love Her\\", in October 1987 and they had already broken up. Hopkinson and Hitchcock joined local garage rockers, Kryptonics, in mid-1987 with Jeff Halley on bass guitar (ex- Sunstones), and Ian Underwood on guitar and vocals. The line-up released an extended play, 69 (May 1989), on Waterfront Records; however, by that time Hopkinson was replaced by Andrew Robinson on drums (ex-Ritual). Hopkinson formed Nursery Crimes, a punky power pop group, in Melbourne in early 1989 with Paddy Chong on bass guitar, David Dixon on guitar and backing vocals, Caine Knight on lead guitar and Phil Rose on lead vocals (ex-Slush Puppies). Their debut single, \\"All Torn up Iniside\\", and EP, No Time for that Crime, appeared late in 1990 on Au Go Go Records. The group's debut album, Fun Hurts!, was issued in May 1992, which was co-produced by the band members with Kaj Dahlstrom. At the end of that year Hopkinson was replaced by Chris Latham on drums. Hopkinson was an occasional drinking buddy of You Am I members, whenever they visited Melbourne, from the turn of the 1990s. A month before the release of that group's first album, Sound As Ever (November 1993), their drummer, Mark Tunaley, was \\"ousted from the band.\\" Hopkinson was brought in as his replacement. Ever since, he has been a core member of the band with Andy Kent on bass guitar and Tim Rogers on vocals, guitar and keyboards. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, Hopkinson \\"supplied the boost of confidence required for You Am I to make the leap into the premier league of Australian rock.\\" His first major performance with his new group was an appearance at the second annual, Big Day Out, national tour during January 1994. Hopkinson's only recorded lead singing role for a You Am I song is on a cover of the Mummies' track \\"(You Must Fight to Live) On the Planet of the Apes\\" which is the B-Side of their single, \\"Good Mornin'\\" (September 1996). During a You Am I tour of the United States, their lead guitarist, Davey Lane, told Hopkinson that he had a side project, the Pictures which had recorded a demo. Hopkinson later described how \\"[Lane] didn't know how to go about putting out a record so I told him that I would do it. After that, I put out a single for The Vines and also for Persian Rugs. That was fun so I thought I'd put out some proper CDs and that is how it started.\\" The Pictures issued a single, \\"You'll See\\" (2001), on Hopkinson's Illustrious Artists label with the Vines' \\"Hot Leather\\" and Persian Rugs' \\"Mr Tripper\\" (both 2002) following. He established a record label, Reverberation, in 2003 with his former Kryptonics bandmate, Ian Underwood. Underwood described how they formed the label, \\"I'd known Russell by that time for about 20 years. We'd played in bands together, we'd been flatmates for a while and I worked for You Am I for a bit too. So Russell had Illustrious Artists and I had a couple of titles laying around as well and we realised that there wasn't anyone out there who wanted to distribute what we had, so we thought we'd have a shot at it ourselves. When we started, Russell had eight titles, I had a few and we just set (Reverberation) up in a room with our entire catalogue in a bookshelf.\\" Drumming style and influences Rogers cites Hopkinson's drumming style as the key part of the group's sound. So much so that when he writes new material, it's the drumming ferocity that will decide whether the song will be performed by You Am I or Rogers' other band, the Tim Rogers and the Temperance Union. Rogers described him, as \\"an enigma, a renaissance man and the best drummer in the world.\\" Rusty is often seen to wear his drumming influences on his sleeve. In a Triple J radio J File interview he comments \\"I try to sound like three different drummers in every song [laughs]\\", citing Ian Paice of Deep Purple as a key influence. Other sixties and seventies influences referenced include the Super Stocks, The Pretty Things, The Honeycombs and the Who. With several songs, particularly on the Convicts album, Rusty recorded the drum tracks after only rehearsing the piece two or three times. His fills are often heavily improvised. Upon the death of Syd Barrett in 2006, Rusty was interviewed on Triple J radio about the influence of Syd in the early days of Pink Floyd. He is also believed to be a fan of much other psychedelic era music. Equipment Since 2001 Rusty has enjoyed a relationship with Pearl Drums whose drums he endorses wholeheartedly. On the 2006 Convicts tour, he played with a blue Pearl five-piece with two floor-mounted toms. He consistently uses Zildjian Custom A cymbals and New Beat 15\\" hi-hats. His snare drum collection includes a solid Jarrah Brady Snare (handmade Western Australian Drum), a 1968 Ludwig Superphonic snare and a handmade perspex Gas snare. Side projects Aside from You Am I, Rusty has also played with Australian punk act Radio Birdman on their Zeno Beach (2006) album and consequent tours. Other bands Rusty is said to have been associated with during the course of his career include Circle A, Zoo Rejects, Genocide, Mob Vengeance, Dismembered, Insurrection, Vicious Circle, Greenhouse Effect, The Bamboos, Memento Mori, Cremator, The Kryptonics, Nursery Crimes and Killing Time as well as playing on The Pictures' second album, Kicking Indiffference. Outside of his band involvements, Rusty manages record label and distribution company Reverberation Records. Hopkinson comperes a show, \\"Stronger Than Dirt\\" (a reference to his beloved Mummies), on Sydney radio station 2SER which features music from the last two centuries including Pre WW2 Folk and Jazz, Obscure Psychedelia, Gutter Punk, \\"Blue\\" Comedy records and Asian Go Go music.

Name In Italian burattino means \\"puppet\\", although it is not clear whether the commedia dell'arte character was called Burattino because he moved like a puppet or puppets acquired the name because of Burattino.Andrews 2008, p. xvii; \\"burattino\\" at WordReference.com. Though only mildly popular on the stage, he found his real fame in the marionette theater. According to Pierre-Louis Duchartre, the puppet named Burattino became so popular in Italy, that \\"by the end of the sixteenth century, all marionettes operated by strings and a wire were called burattini, instead of bagatelli or fantoccini, as they had been known up to that time.\\"Duchartre 1929, p. 120. Today, the Italian word burattino can also refer to a hand puppet. Duchartre also reproduces two illustrations from 1594 with Burattino, in which he wears a costume similar to Zani's but with a characteristic flat round hat.Duchartre 1929, pp. 271, 301. Tommaso Garzoni (1549‚Äì1589) associates the character with a small cap called a berettino. Richard Andrews suggests the two words may be related.Andrews 2008, p. liv, note 37. The word berettino has also been used to refer to the ecclesiastical skullcap more commonly known as the zucchetto. Character Burattino is one of three commedia dell'arte masks mentioned by Bartolomeo Rossi in the foreword to his 1584 comic pastoral play Fiammella, as examples of low-life characters who speak the Bergamasque dialect (usually approximate), the other two being Pedrolino and Arlecchino. As a rustic dialect, it signaled the character's low social status and was used in Italian theatre into the 18th century.Andrews 2008, pp lii‚Äìliii, notes 25, 26; Rossi 1584, p. 3. Burattino is in 21 of the 50 scenarios of Flaminio Scala, published in 1611. He appears as a house servant, an innkeeper, a gardener, a peasant, a beggar, and a long-lost father.Andrews 2008, p. xvii. Like Pedrolino, Burrattino is extremely good natured. He is so trustworthy that, in the third of Scala's scenarios, \\"The Fortunate Isabella\\", the lone innamorata Isabella takes him along as her sole accompaniment on a journey across the country.Scala & Salerno 1967, pp. 22‚Äì23. When he later in the play believes (mistakenly) that Isabella has been kidnapped and raped, he weeps and laments at length.Scala & Salerno 1967, p. 29. Notes Bibliography * Andrews, Richard (2008).

In this book, for the first time in a millennia, the wizards would have to go to war... Plot summary The Lone Power, suspecting that a new threat is rising to its dark abilities, creates a surge of Dark Matter, called \\"the Pullulus\\", to eclipse the universe. Because of the way that the Pullulus affects the universe's structure, the Senior Wizards lose their wizardry and only wizards before adulthood are still able to fight. Ponch uses his tracking abilities to lead Nita, Kit, Ronan, and the wizardly tourists from Wizard's Holiday Filif and Sker'ret across the galaxy to try to find and activate an instrumentality that they are told is the only way to stop the Lone Power. Dairine and Roshaun take a trip back to the Motherboard from High Wizardry to consult the mobiles before joining the others. They find out that the 'weapon' is actually the Hesper, a version of the Lone Power who never fell. The group finds the world the Hesper is on. Unfortunately, the world is one that is 'lost', or devoted to everything the Lone Power represents. Despite this, Nita, Kit, and the others go down to the planet and start searching for the Hesper, after adopting disguises. With Ponch's help, they find the Hesper, and Nita starts teaching her concepts about 'self' and 'choice', concepts that she had no previous understanding of. Nita ask the Hesper to make a choice to fight the Lone Power, but before she can choose, they are captured by the Lone Power, who suppresses all wizardry in the area roughly analogous to cutting a Jedi off from the Force. Ronan sacrifices himself to free the One's Champion, who resides inside him, to give the Hesper a final chance to make her choice. The Champion holds the Lone Power back and restores wizardry to the area, allowing the Hesper to become embodied. As the Hesper assumes her position, the Lone Power is defeated, and the wizards are free to go, as Ronan is near death and the Pullulus is advancing towards Earth and Filif's home. The wizards head back to Earth, except for Filif, who returns to his planet to fight the Pullulus there. They arrive on the moon and find a gathering of all Earth's remaining active wizards, working on a spell to stop the Pullulus. The group joins in to gives energy to the spell, which at first seems to work in pushing the Pullulus back, but then fails due to a lack of power. As the Pullulus comes closer, Roshaun uses his ability to work with stars to directly channel some of the sun's matter to burn the Pullulus, which works for a period until the power drain becomes too great for a single wizard. While the remaining wizards prepare to make one last stand to destroy the Pullulus, Kit tells Ponch to take Carmela and Kit and Nita's parents away from Earth. Ponch starts to obey, but is caught between doing what he is told and staying with his master and friend. He decides to do neither, he completes the canine Choice, which had been held in abeyance because of the long-ago dogs' loyalty to their human partners. The Pullulus takes on a wolf-like shape and Ponch becomes a canine incarnation of the One. The wolf of darkness clashes against the hound of starlight, and it is the wolf that is beaten. Because Ponch has incarnated as a Power, much like the Hesper, he can no longer be with Kit. As he leaves Kit, however, Ponch says that some things will still stay the same. As Nita, Kit, Dairine, and the others pick themselves up, they realize that the Pullulus is gone, and they head home with Ronan healed and without Roshaun or Ponch. The book ends with school starting again, Dairine resolving to discover what had really happened to Roshaun, and Kit finding Ponch in a \\"stray\\" sheepdog that had just shown up on his street. Main characters Nita Once again, one of the protagonists of the series and her buddy go save the world with their friends. In this story, Nita must deal with her feelings for Ronan and becomes 'part of the team'. Kit Another of our main protagonists of the series, ally and best friend as well as Nita's partner. He was the one who invited Ronan (even though Ronan was going to come, but says being invited is better than just coming) to Nita's curiosity. Dairine Nita's younger sister plays a role of going back to the Motherboard with Roshaun to consult the mobiles before going with the others. In the end, she starts to look for what happened to Roshaun. Ronan Ronan, a wizard from Ireland, joins the others while accidentally becoming Carmela's love interest and causing Nita to freak out when she first realized whose voice was at the door. Ponch Kit's dog becomes a very important character because he helps the others by using his tracking abilities and completes the canine Choice. Darryl He, although he does not know it, is a Pillar who is a wizard who has greater power than any other wizard. He is the human equivalent of a Power. He is one of the fellow wizards that help out and destroying the Pullulus. He comes up in The Wizards Dilemma. He is a main character in A Wizard Alone. Roshaun Roshaun, once prince but now Sun King of his planet, travels with Dairine and using his abilities with stars, vanishes when he uses the Sun to dissolve the Darkness, for the power was too great for one wizard. Filif Filif, an exchange wizard from the previous book goes on a search with Sker'ret to find some instrumentality to defeat the Lone Power. Ske'ret A fellow exchange wizard and centipede joins Filif with the search. Hesper Hesper or Hesperus is the 'weapon' the wizards need to defeat the Lone Power for Hesper is a piece of the Lone Power that hasn't fallen. The Lone Power Our chief antagonist of the whole series, makes a capture of the wizards and Hesper, but was defeated (partly since it was only one version of it) when Hesper makes her choice and is on position. The One's Champion The One's Champion was once linked to Ronan, but the link was broken when Ronan releases The One's Champion to make a chance for Hesper to make her choice. It is said that The One's Champion is a male.

Gerassi and his family moved to the United States at the start of World War II and he was hired by Carmelita Hinton, a progressive educator who was the founder and director of the Putney School in Vermont, to teach art at the school. Hinton also employed Gerassi's wife, Stepha, to teach \\"anything she wanted\\" and she would go on to teach a number of subjects during their years at the school, including French, Spanish, Russian, German, ancient history, Latin, and European history. In 1955 Time reported that to support his family while establishing his art career, he tried \\"some 40 different jobs\\". From 1944-1964 Gerassi was harassed by the CIA who tried to blackmail him by threatening to deport his family if he would not agree to work for them. One of his friends eventually reported the harassment to Abe Fortas, then an aide to Lyndon Johnson. Fortas obtained the CIA file and passed it onto the United States Attorney General, Robert F.

History of the USCG cutters  The Revenue Marine and the Revenue Cutter Service, as it was known variously throughout the late 18th and the 19th centuries, referred to its ships as cutters. The term is English in origin and refers to a specific type of vessel, namely, \\"a small, decked ship with one mast and bowsprit, with a gaff mainsail on a boom, a square yard and topsail, and two jibs or a jib and a staysail.\\"Peter Kemp, editor, The Oxford Companion to Ships & the Sea; London: Oxford University Press, 1976; pp. 221-222. With general usage, that term came to define any vessel of the United Kingdom's HM Customs and Excise and the term was adopted by the U.S. Treasury Department at the creation of what would become the Revenue Marine. Since that time, no matter what the vessel type, the service has referred to its vessels with permanently assigned crews as cutters.

Relations between Shi'a-majority Iran and Sunni-majority Pakistan became greatly strained due to sectarian tensions in the 1980s, as Pakistani Shi'a Muslims claimed that they were being discriminated against under the Sunni-biased Islamization program being imposed throughout Pakistan by the military dictatorship government of President Zia-ul-Haq. Following the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran and Saudi Arabia (considered the \\"leading state authority\\" of Shi'a and Sunni Muslims, respectively) gradually began to use Pakistan as a battleground for their proxy sectarian war, and Pakistan's support for the Deobandi Taliban organization in Afghanistan by the 1990s became a problem for Shi'a Iran, which opposed a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. Nevertheless, both countries continue to cooperate economically where possible and are forming alliances in a number of areas of mutual interest, such as fighting the drug trade along their border and combating the insurgency in the Balochistan region. Iran has also expressed an interest in joining the China‚ÄìPakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as part of the larger Chinese Belt and Road Initiative.Iran wants to be part of CPEC, says Rouhani - Pakistan - DAWN.COMIran: Iran keen to become part of China-Pak Economic Corridor India News - Times of India Pakistan is one of the only countries where Iran is viewed positively as per the polls conducted by the Pew Research Center. Polls have consistently shown that a very high proportion of Pakistanis view their western neighbour positively. Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah Khamenei has also called for the sympathy, assistance and inter-cooperation of many Muslim nations, including Pakistan.Ayatollah Khamenei: As Modi embraces Israel, Iran's Ayatollah Khamenei urges support for \\"oppressed Muslims\\" of Kashmir - The Economic Times  Antiquity  Greek historian Herodotus The regions that comprise today's Iran and Pakistan have been under the rule of contiguous Eurasian polities at various points in history, as Pakistan straddles an intermediary zone between the Iranian Plateau and Indian subcontinent. The Persian Achaemenid Empire, which spanned (among other regions) the area between the Balkans and the area of the Indus River (known to the Persians as Hind ) at its height, conquered the regions comprising modern-day Balochistan, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Western Punjab during the reign of Darius I. Relations during the Cold War Imperial Iran maintained close relations with Pakistan during the Cold War, partly owing to their mutual alliance with the United States-led Western Bloc. Iran was the first country to recognize Pakistan as an independent state, and Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was the first head of any state to come on an official state visit to Pakistan (in March 1950). Since 1947, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, had successfully advocated a policy of fostering cordial relations with the Muslim world and Iran in particular. Pakistani President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto meeting with Iranian Queen Farah Pahlavi, 1972 In May 1950, a treaty of friendship was signed by Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan and Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Some of the clauses of the treaty of friendship had wider geopolitical significance. Pakistan found a natural partner in Iran after the Indian government chose to support Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, who was seeking to export a pan-Arab ideology that threatened many of the more traditional Arab monarchies, a number of which were allied with the Shah of Iran. Harsh V. Pant, a foreign policy writer, noted that Iran was a natural ally and model for Pakistan for other reasons as well. Both countries granted each other MFN status for trade purposes; the Shah offered Iranian oil and gas to Pakistan on generous terms, and the Iranian and Pakistani militaries extensively cooperated to suppress the rebel movement in Baluchistan. During the Shah's era, Iran moved closer to Pakistan in many fields. Pakistan, Iran, and Turkey joined the United States- sponsored Central Treaty Organization, which extended a defensive alliance along the Soviet Union's southern perimeter. Iran played an important role in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, providing Pakistan with nurses, medical supplies, and a gift of 5,000 tons of petroleum. Iran also indicated that it was considering an embargo on oil supplies to India for the duration of the armed conflict. The Indian government firmly believed that Iran had blatantly favoured Pakistan and sought to undermine India during the war. After the suspension of American military aid to Pakistan, Iran was reported to have purchased ninety F-86 Sabrejet fighter planes from West Germany, and subsequently delivered them to Pakistan. Although Pakistan's decision to join the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO) in 1955 was largely motivated by its security imperatives regarding India, Pakistan did not sign on until Iran was satisfied that the British government was not going to obstruct the nationalization of British oil companies in Iran. According to Dr. Mujtaba Razvi, Pakistan likely would not have joined CENTO had Iran been negatively affected during these events. Iran again played a vital role for Pakistan in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, this time supplying military equipment as well as diplomatic support against India. The Shah described the Indian attack as blatant aggression and interference in Pakistan's domestic/internal affairs; in an interview with a Parisian newspaper he openly acknowledged that \\"We are one hundred percent behind Pakistan\\". Iranian Prime Minister Amir-Abbas Hoveida followed suit, saying that \\"Pakistan has been subjected to violence and force.\\" The Iranian leadership repeatedly expressed its opposition to the dismemberment of Pakistan, fearing it would adversely affect the domestic stability and security of Iran by encouraging Kurdish and Baloch separatists to rise up against the Iranian government. In the same vein, Iran attempted to justify its supplying of arms to Pakistan on the grounds that, in its desperation, Pakistan might fall into the lap of the Chinese (a communist rival to the U.S.-led Western Bloc). The subsequent breakup of Pakistan in December 1971 convinced Iran that extraordinary effort was needed to protect the stability and territorial integrity of its eastern flank. With the emergence of Bangladesh as a separate state, the \\"Two-Nation Theory/Pakistan Movement\\" as well as the state of Pakistan itself had received a severe negative blow to its reputation and questions arose in the Iranian establishment as to whether the residual western part of Pakistan could hold together and remain a single country. Events of this period caused significant perceptional changes in Tehran regarding Pakistan. When a widespread armed insurgency broke out in Pakistan's Balochistan province in 1973, Iran, fearing the Baloch insurgency might spill over into its own Sistan and Baluchistan Province, offered large-scale support.Foreign Policy Centre, \\"On the Margins of History\\", (2008), p.35 Iran provided Pakistan with military hardware (including thirty AH-1 Cobra attack helicopters), intelligence, and $200 million in aid. The government of then-Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto declared its belief that, as in the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, India was once again behind the unrest and uprising of rebels in the Balochistan region. However, the Indian government denied any involvement, and claimed that it was fearful of further balkanisation of the subcontinent. After three years of fighting the uprising was majorly suppressed. 1976 Iranian postage stamp featuring Pakistan's founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah In addition to military aid, the Shah of Iran offered considerable developmental aid to Pakistan, including oil and gas on preferential terms. Pakistan was a developing country and small power while Iran, in the 1960-70s, had the world's fifth largest military, a strong economic/industrial base and was the clear, undisputed regional superpower. However, Iran's total dependence on the United States at that time for its economic development and military build-up had won it hostility from the more Soviet-aligned Arab world. Brief tensions between Iran and Pakistan arose in 1974, when Mohammad Reza Pahlavi refused to attend the Islamic Conference in Lahore because Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had been ‚Äì despite the known hostility between two ‚Äì invited to it by Pakistan. Later in 1976, Iran again played a vital and influential role by facilitating a rapprochement between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Iran's reaction to India's surprise 1974 nuclear test detonation (codenamed Smiling Buddha) was muted. During a state visit to Iran in 1977, Pakistani PM Bhutto tried to persuade Pahlavi to support Pakistan's own clandestine atomic bomb project. Although the Shah's response is not officially known, there are indications that he refused to oblige Bhutto. In July 1977, following political agitation by an opposition alliance, Bhutto was forced out of office in a military coup d'√©tat. The new military dictatorship government, under General Muhammad Zia- ul-Haq, was ideologically ultraconservative and religiously oriented in its nature and approach in contrast to the more secular Iran at the time. Relationship after the 1979 Iranian Revolution The 1979 Iranian Revolution led progressive Iranian-Pakistani relations to deteriorate as opposed to prospering like they did during the reign of the Shah. Bhutto's ouster was followed a half year later by the Iranian Revolution and subsequent overthrow of the Shah of Iran. The Supreme Leader of the newly established Islamic Republic of Iran, Ruhollah Khomeini, withdrew the country from CENTO and violently ended its association with the United States. The religiously influenced military dictatorship of Zia-ul-Haq and the Islamic Revolution in Iran suited one another well enough, and as such there was no major diplomatic and political cleavage between them. In 1979, Pakistan was one of the first countries in the world to recognize the new revolutionary regime in Iran. Responding swiftly to this revolutionary change, Foreign Minister of Pakistan Agha Shahi immediately undertook a state visit to Tehran, meeting with his Iranian counterpart Karim Sanjabi on 10 March 1979. Both expressed confidence that Iran and Pakistan were going to march together to a brighter future. The next day, Agha Shahi held talks with the Ayatollah, Ruhollah Khomeini, in which developments in the region were discussed. On 11 April 1979, Pakistani President Zia-ul-Haq famously declared that \\"Khomeini is a symbol of Islamic insurgence\\". Reciprocating Zia-ul-Haq's sentiments, Khomeini, in a letter, called for Muslim unity. He declared: \\"Ties with Pakistan are based on Islam.\\" Despite Shi'a-Sunni divisions (Iran being a Shi'a-majority state and Pakistan being a Sunni-majority state), the common desire for a pan-Islamic identity became an important factor in shaping new Iranian‚ÄìPakistani relations. By 1981, however, Zia-ul-Haq's Pakistan had once again formed close ties with the United States, a position it largely remained in for decades to come. Iranian influence on Pakistan's Shi'a population Iranian leaders had sought to extend their sphere of influence into Pakistan and to counter Saudi influence. As such, a pro-Iranian stance amongst many politicized Pakistani Shi'as remains widespread. Many Pakistani Shi'a websites and books are filled with writings advocating the Khomeini regime. Pakistani support for Iran during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War Iran's new revolution in 1979 took the world by surprise, and the Ayatollah's threats to export ultraconservative Shi'a revolutionary influence throughout Iran's neighbouring regions eventually led Saddam Hussein's Sunni-controlled and secular Iraq, backed by the United States and the rest of the Arab world, to invade the country in 1980. The invasion signalled the start of the deadly Iran-Iraq War that would last for eight years until 1988. While Pakistan remained largely neutral, Ruhollah Khomeini's continued threats to export Iranian revolutionary sentiment fuelled tensions between Pakistan's Sunnis and Shi'as. The rising militancy among Shi'a Muslims in neighbouring countries such as Iraq and Pakistan inspired by revolutionary Iran had left many Sunni Muslims in Pakistan feeling deeply threatened. Pakistani President Zia-ul-Haq, despite his pro-Saudi, pro-Sunni and anti-Shi'a sentiments, had to manage his country's security carefully, knowing that Pakistan (due to its alliance with the United States) risked being dragged into a war with its western neighbour, one that it could most likely not afford due to its preoccupations with India in the east. In support of the Gulf Cooperation Council that was formed in 1981, around 40,000 personnel of the Pakistan Armed Forces were stationed in Saudi Arabia to reinforce the internal and external security of the region. The killing of Shi'a pilgrims in the 1987 Mecca incident in Saudi Arabia had met with widespread disturbances and condemnation throughout Pakistan, but Zia-ul-Haq remained firmly neutral and strongly issued orders against engaging any involved parties to Pakistani military personnel stationed in the Gulf. Many U.S.-built Stingers as well as various Chinese weaponry and ammunition shipped to Pakistan primarily for use by the Afghan mujahideen against the Soviets were instead sold to Iran, which proved to be a defining factor for Iran in the Tanker War against Iraq. Despite immense pressure from the United States and other Arab states, Pakistan never openly supported Iraq and provided operational/financial aid to Iran albeit the deployment of troops in Saudi Arabia was for the sole purpose of defending the country from any potential attacks by the Iranians. Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the Afghan Civil War In December 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan to support the pro-Soviet, communist Afghan government against Islamist uprisings, protect its interests in Central Asia and also as a response to established or growing American influence/dominance in the Middle East ‚Äì notably in Israel, Iran (until the 1979 revolution), Iraq, and many other Arab states. In 1980, Iraq's invasion of Iran with backing from both superpowers (the United States and Soviet Union) and other major powers improved an internationally isolated Iran's dysfunctional ties with Pakistan. During the Soviet-Afghan War, Pakistan alongside other major powers such as the United States and China focused its covert support on the Sunni Pashtun groups (a majority in Afghanistan) while Iran largely supported the Shi'a Tajik groups, though they were all united as Afghan mujahideen in waging war against the Soviet invaders. After the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and subsequent victory for the Afghan mujahideen, the rivalry between Iran and Pakistan intensified as the mujahideen broke up into multiple factions, no longer needing a union against foreign invaders. After 1989, Iran and Pakistan's policies in Afghanistan became ever more divergent as Pakistan, under Benazir Bhutto, explicitly supported Taliban forces in Afghanistan during the civil wars that erupted after the Soviet-Afghan War ended. This resulted in a major breach, with Iran becoming closer to Pakistan's rival, India. Pakistan's unwavering and continuous support for the Sunni Taliban organization in Afghanistan after the Soviet withdrawal became a problem for Shi'a Iran which opposed a Taliban- controlled Afghanistan. The Pakistani-backed Taliban fought the Iranian-backed Northern Alliance in Afghanistan and gained control of 90 percent of the country, including the capital city of Kabul. The Taliban established the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and began imposing ultraconservative and radical Wahhabi rule. As noted by a Pakistani foreign service officer, it was difficult to maintain good relations with Israel, Saudi Arabia, the United States, and Iran at the same time, given each state's back-and-forth rivalry with another, and in particular, Iran's rivalry with all three. In 1995 Bhutto paid a lengthy state visit to Iran, which greatly relaxed relations. At a public meeting she spoke highly of Iran and Iranian society. However, increasing activity by Shi'a militants in Pakistan strained relations further. This was followed by the Taliban's capture of the city of Mazar-i-Sharif in 1998, in which thousands of Shi'a Muslims were massacred, according to Amnesty International. The most serious breach in relations came in 1998, after Iran accused the Taliban government's forces of taking 11 Iranian diplomats, 35 Iranian truck drivers and an Iranian journalist hostage, and later executing all of them. Iran massed over 300,000 troops on the Afghan-Iranian border and threatened to invade Afghanistan to depose the Taliban, a government which it had never recognized. This strained Iran's relations with Pakistan, which continued to support the Taliban government. In May 1998, Pakistan conducted its first ever nuclear weapons tests (codenamed Chagai-I), detonating five nuclear weapons at a controlled facility in its Balochistan province in response to Indian tests (codenamed Pokhran-II) a few days earlier, both events would later lead to U.N. sanctions on both Pakistan and India, but did not stop either country from continuing to conduct more tests. Pakistan had now become the seventh country in the world to acquire nuclear weapons (after the United States, Soviet Union, United Kingdom, France, China and India). Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif acknowledged Pakistan's nuclear capability and tests on 7 September 1997. Iran immediately condemned Pakistan for its nuclear testing, and held Pakistan accountable for global \\"atomic proliferation\\".See: Chagai-I Bilateral and multilateral visits in the late 1990s In 1995, Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto paid a state visit to Iran to lay the groundwork for a memorandum on energy, and begin work on an energy security agreement between the two countries. This was followed by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's visit to Tehran for the 8th OIC Summit Conference on 9‚Äì11 December 1997. While there, Sharif held talks with Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, with a view to improving bilateral relations, as well as finding a solution to the crisis in Afghanistan. Chief Executive of Pakistan under a military dictatorship, General Pervez Musharraf paid a two- day visit to Tehran on 8‚Äì9 December 1999. This was his first visit to Iran (and third international trip) since his military coup d'√©tat of 12 October 1999 and subsequent seizure of power in Pakistan. In Iran, Musharraf held talks with Iranian President Mohammad Khatami and with the Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. This visit was arranged to allow Musharraf to explain the reasons for his takeover in Pakistan. The meetings included discussions on the situation in Afghanistan, which were intended to lead both countries to \\"coordinate the policies of our two countries for encouraging the peace process through reconciliation and dialogue among the Afghan parties\\". In 1998, Iran accused Pakistan of committing war crimes in Bamyan, Afghanistan, claiming that Pakistani warplanes had bombarded Afghanistan's last Shi'a stronghold in support of the Taliban government. Relations since 2000 Consul General Qazi Habib ul-Rehman meeting with the Mayor of Mashhad, Seyyed Sowlat Mortazavi Since 2000, relations between Iran and Pakistan have begun to normalize, and economic cooperation has strengthened. The September 11 attacks on the United States changed the foreign policy priorities of both Iran and Pakistan. The George W. Bush administration's tough stance forced Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf to support Washington's War on terror against the Taliban in Afghanistan, which would end the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan in the U.S.-led invasion. Though Iranian officials welcomed the move and deposition of the Taliban, they soon found themselves encircled by U.S. forces in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Central Asia, and the Persian Gulf. U.S. President Bush's inclusion of the Islamic Republic of Iran as part of an \\"axis of evil\\" also led some Iranian officials to presume that Tehran might be next in line for regime change, ending whatever d√©tente had occurred in Iran‚ÄìU.S. ties under Khatami. Bush's emphasis on transformative diplomacy and democratization accompanied by an aggressive American military campaign worried Iranian leaders further. Bilateral visits after 2000 In April 2001, the Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council Hassan Rowhani paid a state visit to Pakistan and met with Pervez Musharraf and his cabinet. During this visit, Iran and Pakistan agreed to put their differences aside and agree on a broad-based government for Afghanistan. Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi paid a two-day visit to Islamabad from 29 to 30 November 2001. Kharazi met with Pakistani Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar and President Musharraf. Iran and Pakistan vowed to improve their relations, and agreed to help establish a broad-based, multi-ethnic government under U.N. auspices. The President of Iran, Mohammad Khatami, paid a three-day state visit to Pakistan from 23 to 25 December 2002, the first visit by an Iranian head of government since 1992. It was a high-level delegation, consisting of the Iranian cabinet, members of the Iranian parliament, Iranian Vice-President and President Khatami. This visit was meant to provide a new beginning to Iran‚ÄìPakistan relations. It would also allow for high-level discussions on the future of the Iran‚ÄìPakistan‚ÄìIndia pipeline (IPI) project. Khatami met, and had detailed discussions, with both President Musharraf and the new Prime Minister Zafarullah Khan Jamali. Several accords were signed between Iran and Pakistan in this visit. Khatami also delivered a talk on \\"Dialogue Among Civilizations,\\" at The Institute of Strategic Studies. The presidential delegation initially visited Islamabad, and then followed that up with a visit to Lahore, where Khatami also paid his respects at the tomb of Allama Sir Muhammad Iqbal. A Joint communique was issued by Iran and Pakistan on the conclusion of Khatami's visit. On his return to Tehran, Khatami evaluated the trip as \\"positive and fruitful\\". As in return, Jamali paid a state visit in 2003 where he held talks with economic cooperation, security of the region, and better bilateral ties between Pakistan and Iran. During this visit, Jamali gave valuable advises to Iranian leadership on their nuclear programme \\"against the backdrop of the country's\\" negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and measures to strengthen economic relations between the two countries. Military and security Iranian support for Pakistan dates back to the 1960s when Iran supplied Pakistan with American military weaponry and spare parts after America cut off their military aid to Pakistan. After 1971 Indo-Pakistani War, new Prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto immediately withdrew Pakistan from CENTO and SEATO after Bhutto thought that the military alliances failed to protect or appropriately assist Pakistan and instead alienated the Soviet Union. A serious military cooperation between took place during the Balochistan insurgency phases against the armed separatist movement in 1974‚Äì77. Around ~100,000 Pakistan and Iranian troops were involved in quelling the separatist organizations in Balochistan and successfully put the resistance down in 1978‚Äì80. In May 2014, the two countries agreed to joint operations against terrorists and drug traffickers in the border regions. In 2019, following a suicide bombing in Khash‚ÄìZahedan which killed 27 Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and wounded 13 others, Iranian officials criticised Pakistan. Iranian Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari asked Pakistan to conduct crack down against armed group Jaish al-Adl before Tehran takes it revenge. In February 2019, Bahram Ghasemi, speaking for the Foreign Ministry of Iran, said it would not tolerate what it saw as Pakistan's \\"inability to stop cross-border attacks in Iran\\". Pakistan, in turn, offered Iran cooperation in investigating the bombing, and expressed sympathy for the victims of the attack. A Pakistani delegation was due to travel to Iran.Pakistan offers cooperation to Iran over probe into attack, The Dawn. On 12 May 2020 following a terrorist attack on the Pakistan-Iran border which killed six Pakistani soldiers and injured 1, COAS General Qamar Javed Bajwa and Chief of General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran Mohammad Bagheri had a telephonic conversation in which both commanders discussed ways to deal with the current ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and border security and then agreed to enhance border security. The Iranian air force has ordered approximately 25 MFI-17 Mushshaks from Pakistan. Iran's view on Kashmir issue On 19 November 2010 Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei appealed to Muslims worldwide to back the freedom struggle in Jammu and Kashmir, equating the dispute with the ongoing conflicts of the Greater Middle East region. \\"Today the major duty of the elite of the Islamic Ummah is to provide help to the Palestinian nation and the besieged people of Gaza, to sympathize and provide assistance to the nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq and Occupied Kashmir, to engage in struggle and resistance against the aggressions of the United States, the Zionist Regime...\\" He further said that Muslims should be united and \\"spread awakening and a sense of responsibility and commitment among Muslim youth throughout Islamic communities\\". The thrust of his speech was directed at Israel, India, and the US, but also made a veiled reference to Pakistan's nuclear program: \\"The US and the West are no longer the unquestionable decision-makers of the Middle East that they were two decades ago. Contrary to the situation 20 years ago, nuclear know-how and other complex technologies are no longer considered inaccessible daydreams for Muslim nations of the region.\\" He said the US was bogged down in Afghanistan and \\"is hated more than ever before in disaster- stricken Pakistan\\". A former president of Iran (1981‚Äì89), Khamenei succeeded Ayatollah Khomeini as the spiritual head of the Iranian people. A staunch supporter of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Khamenei is believed to be highly influential in Iran's foreign policy. Khamenei visited Jammu and Kashmir in the early 1980s and delivered a sermon at Srinagar's Jama Masjid mosque. In 2017, Iran's leader Ayatollah Khamenei said that Kashmiris are being oppressed. He also urged Muslim world to \\"openly support people of Kashmir and repudiate oppressors and tyrants who attacked people in Ramadan\\". By 2019, after India had removed the autonomy of Indian Kashmir, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan thanked Iran's Supreme Leader, for his support of Pakistan's position on the Kashmir issue.PM Imran thanks Iranian Supreme Leader for supporting Kashmir issue - Pakistan - Dunya News Atoms for Peace cooperation Since 1987, Pakistan has steadily blocked any Iranian acquisition of nuclear weapons; however, Pakistan has wholeheartedly supported Iran's viewpoint on the issue of its nuclear energy program, maintaining that \\"Iran has the right to develop its nuclear program within the ambit of NPT.\\" In 1987 Pakistan and Iran signed an agreement on civil nuclear energy cooperation, with Zia-Ul-Haq personally visiting Iran as part of its \\"Atoms for Peace\\" program. Internationally, Zia calculated that this cooperation with Iran was purely a \\"civil matter\\", necessary for maintaining good relations with Tehran. According to IAEA, Iran wanted to purchase fuel-cycle technology from Pakistan, but was rebuffed. Zia did not approve any further nuclear deals, but one of Pakistan's senior scientists did secretly hand over a sensitive report on centrifuges in 1987‚Äì89. In 2005, IAEA evidence showed that Pakistani cooperation with Iran's nuclear program was limited to \\"non-military spheres\\", and was peaceful in nature. Tehran had offered as much as $5 billion for nuclear weapons technology in 1990, but had been firmly rejected. Centrifuge technology was transferred in 1989; since then, there have been no further atoms for peace agreements. In 2005, IAEA evidence revealed that the centrifuge designs transferred in 1989 were based on early commercial power plant technology, and were riddled with technical errors; the designs were not evidence of an active nuclear weapons program.Linzer, Dafna (23 August 2005). \\"No Proof Found of Iran Arms Program; Uranium Traced to Pakistani Equipment\\". The Washington Post. Retrieved 20 September 2009. Non-belligerent policy and official viewpoint Difficulties have included disputes over trade, and political position. While Pakistan's foreign policy maintains balanced relations with Saudi Arabia, the United States, and the European Union, Iran tends to warn against it, and raised concerns about Pakistan's absolute backing of the Taliban during the fourth phase of civil war in Afghanistan in the last years of the 20th century. Through a progressive reconciliation and chaotic diplomacy, both countries come closer to each other in last few years. In the changing security environment, Pakistan and Iran boosted their ties by maintaining the warmth in the relationship without taking into account the pressures from international actors.http://www.opinion-maker.org/2012/03/pak- iran-relations-the-changing-scenario/ On Iran's nuclear program and its own relations with Iran, Pakistan adopted a policy of neutrality, and played a subsequent non-belligerent role in easing the tension in the region. Since 2006, Pakistan has been strategically advising Iran on multiple occasions to counter the international pressure on its nuclear program to subsequently work on civil nuclear power, instead of active nuclear weapons program. On international front, Pakistan has been a great advocate for Iranian usage of nuclear energy for economics and civil infrastructure while it steadily stop any Iranian acquisition of nuclear weapons, fearing another nuclear armed race with Saudi Arabia. In a speech at Harvard University in 2010, the Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi justified Iran's nuclear program as peaceful and argued that Iran had \\"no justification\\" to pursue nuclear weapons, citing the lack of any immediate threat to Iran, and urged Iran to \\"embrace overtures\\" from the United States. Qureshi also observed that Iran had signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and should respect the treaty. Iran and Pakistan have been described as competitors for influence in the Middle East by some geo-political analysts, who argue a nuclear armed Iran could further agitate Pakistan. Both countries also have a history of mutual distrust, accusing each other of supporting religious and ethnic rebels within each other's borders.After Soleimani killing, Iran‚Ä≤s proxy war to impact Afghanistan and Pakistan AsiaAn in-depth look at news from across the continent DW 07.01.2020 Flood relief During the 2019 Iran floods, Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority, on the order of country's Prime Minister Imran Khan sent 32 tonnes of relief goods to Iran. The consignment comprising two shipments contained 500 tents, 3,300 blankets and emergency medical kits. The relief goods were transferred using two C-130 aircraft. Previously Pakistan's Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson, Dr. Muhammad Faisal, condoled with the families of the victims. The spokesperson further claimed that Pakistan is ready to provide humanitarian assistance to Iran in rescue effort. He claimed that people of Pakistan stand in solidarity with Iranian people in their difficult time. Trade and Economics Modified image of Iran-Pakistan national gas pipeline. Relations between Iran and Pakistan improved after the removal of the Taliban in 2002, but tensions remain. Pakistan has been under a strong influence of Saudi Arabia in its competition with Shiite majority Iran for influence across the broader Islamic world, which it already has in its allied nations Lebanon and Syria. Iran considers northern and western Afghanistan as its sphere of influence since its population is Persian Dari speaking. Pakistan considers southern and eastern Afghanistan as its sphere of influence since it is Pashto and Baloch speaking such as the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Baluchistan, respectively. Free Trade Agreement In 2005, Iran and Pakistan had conducted US$500 million of trade. The land border at Taftan is the conduit for trade in electricity and oil. Iran is extending its railway network towards Taftan. The Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline (IPI Pipeline) is currently under discussion; though India backed out from the project. The Indian government was under pressure by the United States against the IPI pipeline project, and appears to have heeded American policy after India and the United States proceeded to sign the nuclear deal. In addition, the international sanctions on Iran due to its controversial nuclear program could also become a factor in derailing IPI pipeline project altogether. Trade between the two countries has increased by ¬£1.4 billion in 2009. In 2007‚Äì08, annual Pakistan merchandise trade with Iran consisted of $256 million in imports and $218.6 million in export, according to WTO. Bilateral trade On 12 January 2001, Pakistan and Iran formed a \\"Pakistan-Iran Joint Business Council\\" (PIJB) body on trade disputes. The body works on to encourage the privatization in Pakistan and economic liberalization on both sides of the countries. In 2012, the bilateral trade exceeded $3 billion. Official figures from the State Bank of Pakistan for fiscal year 2011‚Äì12 indicate imports of $124 million and exports of $131 million, which had collapsed to $36 million of exports to Iran and less than $1 million of imports for the year to April 2015. In 2011, the trade between Iran and Pakistan stood at less than $1 billion and the common geographical borders as well as religious affinities are among other factors, which give impetus to enhanced level of trade. According to the media reports, Iran is the second-largest market of Basmati rice of Pakistan, ranking after Iraq. Techno-Entrepreneurship Momentum of improvement of economic and political relationships between Iran and Pakistan has created a wave of bilateral agreements between Iranian and Pakistan authorities. Techno- entrepreneurship is the highly trending topic of discussion in the global development and in ECO region (Pakistan-Iran-Turkey), a lot of joint projects have been executed since 2016. ScienceTech+ Center was the first joint techno- entrepreneurship center, which was established by the Pakistani and Iranian entrepreneurs in a joint agreement between CODE Entrepreneurship Consultants Ltd (Pakistan) and Ideparvaran MashreghQazal Ltd (Iran). Several events under this platform are being organized by the [Pakistani in Iran] and Iranian authorities under the title of KarafarinShow in Iran, Pakistan and Turkey. Effects of US sanctions on Iran The U.S. economic sanctions on Iran regarding their nuclear program generally affected Pakistan's industrial sector. The fruit industry of Pakistan have reportedly lost a lucrative market in Iran, where at least 30,000 tons of mango were exported previously, as a result of the trade embargo imposed by the United States on Tehran. According to the statistics by Pakistan, the fruit industry and the exporters could not export around $10 million worth of mango during the current season. The Ministry of Commerce (MoCom) has been in direct contact with the US Department of Agriculture to resolve the issue through diplomatic channels. Energy Iran‚ÄìPakistan gas pipeline Discussions between the governments of Iran and Pakistan started in 1994 for the gas pipelines and energy security. A preliminary agreement was signed in 1995 by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, in which, this agreement foresaw construction of a pipeline from South‚ÄìNorth Pars gas field to Karachi in Pakistan. Later, Iran made a proposal to extend the pipeline from Pakistan into India. In February 1999, a preliminary agreement between Iran and India was signed. Iran has the world's second largest gas reserves, after Russia, but has been trying to develop its oil and gas resources for years, due to sanctions by the West. However, the project could not take off due to different political reasons, including the new gas discoveries in Miano, Sawan and Zamzama gas fields of Pakistan. The Indian concerns on pipeline security and Iranian indecisiveness on different issues, especially prices. The Iran- Pakistan-India (denoted as IPI Pipeline) project was planned in 1995 and after almost 15 years India finally decided to quit the project in 2008 despite severe energy crises in that country. In February 2007, India and Pakistan agreed to pay Iran US$4.93 per million BTUs (US$4.67/GJ) but some details relating to price adjustment remained open to further negotiation. Since 2008, Pakistan began facing severe criticism from the United States over any kind of energy deal with Iran. Despite delaying for years the negotiations over the IPI gas pipeline project, Pakistan and Iran have finally signed the initial agreement in Tehran in 2009. The project, termed as the peace pipeline by officials from both the countries, was signed by President Zardari and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran. In 2009, India withdrew from the project over pricing and security issues, and after signing another civilian nuclear deal with the United States in 2008. However, in March 2010 India called on Pakistan and Iran for trilateral talks to be held in May 2010 in Tehran. According to the initial design of the project, the 2,700 km long pipeline was to cover around 1,100 km in Iran, 1,000 km in Pakistan and around 600 km in India, and the size of the pipeline was estimated to be 56 inches in diameter. However, as India withdrew from the project the size of the pipeline was reduced to 42 inch. In April 2008, Iran expressed interest in the People's Republic of China's participation in the project. Since as early as in 2005, China and Pakistan are already working on a proposal for laying a trans- Himalayan pipeline to carry Middle Eastern crude oil to western China. Beijing has been pursuing Tehran and Islamabad for its participation in the pipeline project and willing to sign a bilateral agreement with Iran. China and Pakistan are already working on a proposal for laying a trans-Himalayan pipeline to carry Middle Eastern crude oil to western China. In August 2010, Iran invited Bangladesh to join the project. Power Transmissions Tehran has provided ‚Ç¨50 million for laying of 170Km transmission line for the import of 1000MW of electricity from Iran in 2009. Pakistan is already importing 34MW of electricity daily from Iran. The imported electricity is much cheaper than the electricity produced by the Independent Power Producers (IPPs) because Iran subsidises oil and gas which feed the power plants. Iran has also offered to construct a motorway between Iran and Pakistan connecting the two countries. Diplomacy and role in mediation Since Iran has no diplomatic relations with the United States; the Iranian interests section in the United States is represented by the Embassy of Pakistan Embassy in Washington. Iranian nuclear scientist, Shahram Amiri, thought to have been abducted by CIA from Saudi Arabia, took sanctuary in the Pakistan Embassy in Washington, D.C. The Iranian government claimed the United States has trumped up charges they were involved with the 9/11 attacks. Diplomatic missions Iranian missions in Pakistan Iran's chief diplomatic mission to Pakistan is the Iranian Embassy in Islamabad. The embassy is further supported by many Consulates located throughout in Pakistan. The Iranian government supports Consulates in several major Pakistan's cities including: Karachi‚Ä°, Lahore‚Ä°, Quetta‚Ä°, Peshawar‚Ä°. Iranian government maintains a cultural consulate-general, Persian Research Center, and Sada-o-Sima center, all in Islamabad. Other political offices includes cultural centers in Lahore‚Ä†, Karachi‚Ä†, Rawalpindi‚Ä†, Peshawar‚Ä†, Quetta‚Ä†, Hyderabad‚Ä†, and Multan‚Ä†. * ‚Ä° denotes mission is Consulate General * ‚Ä† denotes mission is Khana-e-Farhang (lit. culture center) There is also an Iran Air corporate office located in Karachi Metropolitan Corporation site. Immigration In the Balochistan region of southeastern Iran and western Pakistan, the Balochi people routinely travel the area with little regard for the official border, causing considerable problems for the Iranian Guards Corps and the Frontier Corps of Pakistan. Both countries have ongoing conflicts with Balochi separatist groups. Since 2010, there has been an increase in meetings between senior figures of both governments as they attempt to find a regional solution to the Afghan war and continue discussions on a proposed Iran‚ÄìPakistan gas pipeline and an Economic Cooperation Organization. Iranian media delegations have been visiting Pakistan annually since 2004, with many journalists settling in Pakistan. These visits have played an effective role in promoting mutual understanding and projecting a positive image of Pakistan in Iran. Notable Pakistani political figures Benazir, Murtaza, and Shahnawaz Bhutto were half Iranian Kurds on their mother's side. Pakistani missions in Iran Pakistan's chief diplomatic mission to Iran is the Pakistani embassy in Tehran. It is further supported by two consulates-general located throughout Iran.

It features a 64 step sequencer and is MIDI-controllable. The sound is generated by digital signal processor circuits but can be manipulated in realtime (analog modeling synthesizer principle). A cross modulation function (replacing the previous ring modulation of the Mk I version) can be applied to percussion synthesizers 1 and 2 in the ER-1 Mk II version. The only other differences were new preset rhythm patterns and the metal casing. Because of the easy programming possibilities and competitive pricing the ER-1 quickly became popular among DJs and studio musicians. The overall sound character can be described as, although synthetic, similar to classic analog drum machines. However, the sound remains completely \\"tweakable\\" allowing realtime human variation and interaction, not unlike 4 simultaneous percussion synthesizers.

He was a member of the party's top decision-making body, the Politburo Standing Committee, from 1987 to 1997. He was a contender for the paramount leadership of China, but lost out to his political rival Jiang Zemin, who assumed the post of General Secretary of the party in 1989. Qiao Shi instead served as Chairman of the National People's Congress, then the third-ranked political position, from 1993 until his retirement in 1998. Compared with his peers, including Jiang Zemin, Qiao Shi adopted a more liberal stance in political and economic policy, promoting the rule of law and market-oriented reform of state-owned enterprises. Early life Qiao Shi was born Jiang Zhitong () in December 1924 in Shanghai. His father was from Dinghai, Zhejiang province and worked as an accountant in Shanghai. His mother was a worker at Shanghai No. 1 Textile Mill. He studied literature at East China Associated University, but did not graduate. He adopted the nom de guerre Jiang Qiaoshi after becoming involved with underground revolutionary activities when he was sixteen years old, as was common practice at the time for young aspiring Communists. He eventually dropped the surname Jiang altogether and simply went by \\"Qiao Shi\\". He joined the Communist Party of China in August 1940, and became involved with the anti-Kuomintang student movement in his youth. His specialty was intelligence and security. Mao era After the People's Republic of China was established in 1949, Qiao Shi served as a leader of the Communist Youth League in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province until 1954. From 1954 to 1962, he worked at Anshan Iron and Steel Company in Liaoning province, and then Jiuquan Iron and Steel Company in Gansu province. In 1963, Qiao Shi was transferred to the International Liaison Department (ILD) of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. He was recognized as an expert in international studies, and travelled widely to other communist countries. However, he was severely persecuted when the Cultural Revolution began in 1966, because his wife Yu Wen was a niece of Chen Bulei, a key advisor to the Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek. He underwent numerous struggle sessions, which caused him to be hospitalized for duodenal ulcer and blood loss. In 1969, Qiao Shi and his wife were sent to work in rural labour camps, first in Heilongjiang, and later in Henan province. He was able to return to the ILD in 1971, when Geng Biao became Director of the department. Rise to power After the end of the Cultural Revolution, Qiao Shi became the Deputy Director of ILD in 1978, and Director in 1982, responsible for managing relationships with foreign communist parties. He also became an alternate member of the central Secretariat, the day-to-day executive arm of the party organization. Subsequently, he also held the positions of head of the CPC General Office, in charge of routine party administration, and of the Organization Department, in charge of human resources. Under his directorship, the General Office changed its focus from class struggle to economic development, as part of the reform and opening-up policy. In 1985, Chinese spy chief Yu Qiangsheng defected to the United States, causing Politburo member and Political and Legal Affairs Commission Secretary Chen Pixian to be demoted. Qiao Shi was then selected to fill the void, partly due to his proximity to General Secretary Hu Yaobang and earning the approval of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. In that year, Qiao Shi was elected to the Politburo of the Communist Party, the second highest rung of power. In 1986, he became a Vice Premier of the State Council. From 1987 to 1997, Qiao Shi was a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, China's top decision-making body, overseeing the broad portfolios of internal security, intelligence, justice, and party discipline. From 1987 to 1992, he also served as the Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the party's agency in charge of anti-corruption efforts. Tiananmen Square and aftermath Qiao Shi was thought to have played a key role during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, but it is uncertain whether he supported or opposed the crackdown against the student protesters. Most sources, including the autobiography of General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, said that Qiao Shi held an ambivalent position on how to deal with the protests. He was said to be tolerant of the student movement, and abstained from a May 1989 Politburo vote on whether to send the army to Tiananmen Square. Qiao Shi managed to keep his leadership position when his Politburo colleagues Zhao Ziyang and Hu Qili, who opposed the crackdown, were purged. In the political aftermath of Tiananmen Square, Qiao Shi and Premier Li Peng were touted as two of the top candidates to lead the party. However, Deng and many party elders felt that Li Peng was too far left and had insufficient knowledge of economics to take the top job. Qiao Shi therefore appeared to be a 'default' choice based on his experience and seniority at the time. Deng personally arranged a meeting with Qiao Shi to discuss the leadership question. However, Qiao Shi eventually lost out to his rival, Shanghai Party Committee Secretary Jiang Zemin, who assumed the party's leading post in 1989 and the presidency in 1993. It was never made clear why Qiao Shi did not get the nod to become party leader. Observers speculated that Qiao Shi had too much prior experience in law enforcement and therefore was more prone to hardline, aggressive tactics to deal with issues, or that Qiao Shi had lost favour with important \\"party elders\\" - retired leaders who nevertheless held significant influence in the leadership succession process. Qiao Shi instead became Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in March 1993, officially ranked third in political positions in the People's Republic of China, after General Secretary and Premier. As head of the national legislature, he tried to strengthen China's legal system and turn the national congress from a rubber-stamp body into an institution with real power in establishing the rule of law. Dissident leader and Tiananmen student leader Wang Dan once commented, \\"Although Qiao Shi is a master of illusions, it's possible that he could lead China toward more enlightened rule.\\" Relationship with Jiang Zemin After 1989, Qiao Shi was known to have a tense relationship with the newly anointed General Secretary Jiang Zemin. Jiang, who had overnight climbed from a municipal leader to Leader of the Communist Party of China, was a mere Politburo member at the time he was called up to Beijing to take the reins (Qiao was a Standing Committee member, one rank above Jiang). Qiao was a party veteran who had served the central organization for over a decade, while Jiang never had any experience in the centre. Qiao also had a glowing resume with revolutionary credentials during his days as a student agitator in Shanghai; Jiang's revolutionary experience appeared unsubstantial by comparison. As a result, it was not lost on political observers and those in the highest echelons of power that Jiang had 'leapfrogged' over Qiao, who by all measures seemed more qualified, had better credentials, and had a wider political network compared to Jiang. Moreover, Qiao Shi's time as China's law enforcement chief meant that he had trusted aides staffed in key positions around the country, which was seen as a dormant threat if not an explicit challenge to Jiang's leadership. Retirement After the death of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in 1997, Jiang Zemin succeeded in excluding Qiao Shi from the CPC Central Committee and the Politburo at the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China by lowering the retirement age for party officials to 70 years of age, consolidating his power. In 1998, Qiao Shi, then 73, retired from politics, and largely stayed out of the public eye thereafter. While Qiao Shi left active politics in 1998, his tenure in the highest echelons of the party and government earned him the distinction of holding the largest number of key offices compared to any of his contemporaries or any leader in succeeding generations. Among other things, Qiao Shi was at one point the top official in charge of party administration, organization and human resources, ideological indoctrination, internal discipline, intelligence, internal security, legislation, law enforcement, and the justice system. By virtue of his Standing Committee membership, Qiao Shi remained the top official in charge of law enforcement even during his term as the chairman of the National People's Congress. Unlike his peers, most notably Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, Qiao Shi did not attend even the most important events on the Chinese political calendar after he retired, including the successive party congresses, National People's Congresses, the opening ceremonies of the Beijing Olympics, or various anniversaries of historical events. In 2012, he published the book Qiao Shi On Democracy and Rule of Law, which received significant attention from both domestic and international media. That Qiao Shi, a normally low-profile figure content with retirement, would publish such a work in his old age led to speculation that the book was a veiled criticism against the perceived deterioration of the legal and security portfolio under security chief Zhou Yongkang. In 2014, Qiao Shi donated 11 million yuan to the China Legal Exchange Foundation, whose goal was to promote justice and the rule of law. Decline and death Qiao Shi died on 14 June 2015 in Beijing at the age of 90. In his official obituary, Qiao Shi was extolled as \\"an excellent Party member, a time-tested fighter for the communist cause, and an outstanding proletarian revolutionary, statesman and leader of the Party and the state\\". Qiao Shi was the first major leader from the third-generation of leadership to have died. His obituary numbered over 2,000 Chinese characters, half of the length of the obituaries of second-generation stalwarts Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun, but far higher than the word count of the obituaries of Hua Guofeng, Liu Huaqing, and Huang Ju, who were each given a mere few hundred words. The announcement of his death was the third item on the evening Xinwen Lianbo program; the announcement was made in the form of a \\"joint statement\\" by the top organs of the party and state, which is generally reserved for only the highest-ranked leaders. Flags were flown at half-mast in mourning of Qiao Shi's death. Qiao's send-off ceremony took place at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery on June 19, 2015. It was attended by President and Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping, Premier Li Keqiang, and all the other sitting members of the Politburo Standing Committee except for Zhang Gaoli, who at the time was away on a visit to Europe. Former general secretary Hu Jintao also attended. Jiang Zemin did not attend the funeral proceedings, but state news agencies made special mention of Jiang expressing his condolences; Jiang and his family sent a wreath to the ceremony. Family Qiao Shi married Yu Wen (; 1926‚Äì2013) in early 1952. They had met when they were both working for the underground Communist Party in Shanghai in the 1940s. They had two daughters and two sons. Their eldest son, Jiang Xiaoming (; born 1953), earned a doctorate in economics at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. Their younger daughter, Qiao Xiaoxi (), studied medicine at Baylor University and worked in the United States. They had two other children, son Jiang Xiaodong () and daughter Qiao Ling (). Qiao's family is largely scandal free and has never been the target of overseas media speculation or criticism, unlike the families of other top Communist officials. Honours In April 1996, Qiao Shi was awarded an honorary citizenship by the Cuban capital Havana, and an honorary doctorate in law by the University of Regina of Canada.

Background The song \\"Thanks for the Memory\\", written for the February 1938 film The Big Broadcast of 1938 by Leo Robin and Ralph Rainger and performed by Bob Hope and Shirley Ross had proved very popular. Carmichael and Loesser were asked to write a new song for a follow-up film titled Thanks for the Memory. They came up with \\"Two Sleepy People\\" which was again sung by Hope and Ross. The song tells of a young couple in love, who, despite being sleepy, sit up together until dawn because they don't want to say good night and part. That sounds like a courting couple, but then the song goes on to assure us that they're married. Assuming that they don't have separate bedrooms, why would being in love keep them from just going to bed? Of course, it's not impossible that they just really enjoy sitting up and being in love, and it got to be a habit. Be that as it may, this looks suspiciously like a censorship issue, and as a song that debuted in a movie, it would be subject to the restrictions of the Production Code. One can conceive that, as conveyed in the first verse, the concept was originally to portray a courting couple who innocently sat up and couldn't bear to part, but this would be a red flag to the censors. Technically, they spent the night together, which would be too racy for the public's tender ears. Later on, in 1957, the Everly Brothers' \\"Wake Up, Little Susie\\" was banned in Boston, because it told of a dating couple who fell asleep at the movies and would be scandalously late coming home. Never mind that they were just sitting in a theater, they were together there, and they were asleep, so technically they slept together. In 1938 the Two Sleepy People couldn't decently sit up all night together if single, so they had to be married, and the story adjusted accordingly, even if it didn't make quite as much sense. Despite this it had great appeal and certainly caught on. The song was an immediate hit with the version by Fats Waller being the most popular. Other hit versions in 1938 were by Sammy Kaye & His Orchestra (vocal by Charlie Wilson), Kay Kyser & His Orchestra (vocals by Ginny Simms and Harry Babbitt), Bob Crosby & His Orchestra (vocals by Bob Crosby and Marian Mann), Hoagy Carmichael & Ella Logan, and by Lawrence Welk & His Orchestra (vocal by Walter Bloom). The version by Bob Hope and Shirley Ross was also popular in 1939.  Other notable recordings  The song has been performed and recorded by a number of artists including Al Bowlly, Bing Crosby & Marilyn Maxwell, Sammy Davis Jr. & Carmen McRae, Art Garfunkel, Vince Jones, Julie London, Dean Martin & Line Renaud, Silje Nergaard, Jack Pleis, Carly Simon & John Travolta, Peter Skellern, Hank Jones, Helen Forrest (with Artie Shaw) and a duet with Alice Babs and Ulrik Neumann and Carsie Blanton, and another duet by Seth MacFarlane and Norah Jones. It was also performed on the 1975 variety show Twiggy, featuring the famous model, and Jeremy Brett, later renowned for his portrayal of Sherlock Holmes. The song was performed by Dorothy Lamour on the October 30, 1938 broadcast of the Chase and Sanborn Hour radio program. It was recorded by Philip and Vanessa in 1974 and was included in their album Two Sleepy People.

They are histological evidence of the small amount of cytoplasm that remains in the inner layer of the myelin sheath created by Schwann cells wrapping tightly around an axon (nerve fiber).  Development  In the peripheral nervous system (PNS) axons can be either myelinated or unmyelinated. Myelination refers to the insulation of an axon with concentric surrounding layers of lipid membrane (myelin) produced by Schwann cells. These layers are generally uniform and continuous, but due to imperfect nature of the process by which Schwann cells wrap the nerve axon, this wrapping process can sometimes leave behind small pockets of residual cytoplasm displaced to the periphery during the formation of the myelin sheath. These pockets, or \\"incisures\\", can subdivide the myelinated axon into irregular portions. These staggered clefts also provide communication channels between layers by connecting the outer collar of cytoplasm of the Schwann cell to the deepest layer of myelin sheath. Primary incisures appear ab initio in myelination and always extend across the whole radial thickness of the myelin sheath but initially around only part of its circumference. Secondary incisures appear later, in regions of a compact myelin sheath, initially traversing only part of its radial thickness but commonly occupying its whole circumference.Small, J.

Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, is named in his honor. Background The son of a lawyer, Hickam was born in Spencer, Indiana, the eldest of four children. While a student at the Indiana University in Bloomington, he was a member of the Indiana National Guard, then received an appointment to the United States Military Academy, where he excelled in both academics and athletics. Hickam graduated 46th in his West Point class on 14 February 1908 and was commissioned second lieutenant, 11th Cavalry, serving in Vermont 1908‚Äì09, Georgia 1909‚Äì11, and Texas 1911‚Äì13. In 1911, while at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, Hickam received flying training in addition to his regularly assigned duties. In January 1914, he was transferred to the 8th Cavalry, then in the Philippines, arriving at Camp Stotsenberg in December 1913. A year later he was promoted to fill a first lieutenant vacancy in the 7th Cavalry, also at Camp Stotsenberg, and returned with the 7th Cavalry to the United States in December 1915 to Douglas, Arizona. He served in Mexico as part of the Mexican Punitive Expedition and saw action on March 19, 1916 at Guerrero; April 22, at Tomochic, Chihuahua, where he was awarded the Silver Star in an action against Villistas led by Candelario Cervantes; and at Piojo Canyon on June 20. In November 1916, Hickam left the 7th Cavalry to serve as a Professor of Military Science at the University of Maine and received promotion to captain of Cavalry, in May 1917, after the United States entered World War I. He joined the 18th Cavalry in July, but this unit was redesignated as field artillery. Air Service and Air Corps duty Hickam's association with aviation began with the United States' entry into World War I. On 22 September 1917, he received temporary promotion to major in the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps and was assigned to organize the Aviation Concentration Camp at Garden City, New York. From October 1917 to May 1918 he served as executive officer of the Aeronautical General Supply Depot and Concentration Barracks there. In May 1918 he reported to Rockwell Field, California, for pilot training and received a Junior Military Aviator rating on 16 June 1918, as a member of the U.S. Air Service. Hickam continued advanced flying training at Dorr Field, Arcadia, Florida. From 30 September 1918 to 30 January 1919, he was commandant of both the Pursuit School and the Aerial Gunnery School at Carlstrom Field. On January 21, 1919, Major Hickam was appointed chief of the Information Division, Office of the Director of Air Service, in Washington D.C., where he supervised the first written history of the Air Service. He reverted to his permanent rank of captain on 30 June 1920, received a promotion to major, Cavalry on 1 July, when the National Defense Act of 1920 took effect, and received a transfer to the Air Service in the grade of major on 6 August 1920. In January 1923, Hickam became assistant commandant of the Advanced Flying School, Kelly Field, Texas, and commanded the 10th School Group to 1 August 1925. In November 1925, while a student at the Air Service Tactical School at Langley Field, Virginia, he testified on behalf of airpower and a separate Air Force before the Morrow Board, appointed by President Coolidge and chaired by Dwight Morrow to offset adverse political effects of the court martial of Billy Mitchell. After graduation from ASTS, Hickam next was a student at the Command and General Staff College (Fort Leavenworth, Kansas) 1926-27, and at the Army War College (Washington, D.C.) 1927-28, as preparation for a four- year detail to the War Plans Division of the General Staff. Hickam was promoted to lieutenant colonel on March 1, 1932, and given command of the 3rd Attack Group, based at Fort Crockett, Galveston, Texas. From February to June 1934, during the Air Mail scandal, he commanded mail delivery operations in the Central Zone, headquartered in Chicago. On May 10, 1926, while a student at the ASTS, he collided in mid-air during a flight formation with fellow student, Major Harold Geiger. Hickam parachuted to safety, and narrowly escaped death. This resulted in Hickam's initiation into the famed \\"Caterpillar Club,\\" a fraternal order with membership based on surviving an emergency parachute jump.Horace Meek Hickam, Lieutenant Colonel, United States Army Air Corps at www.arlingtoncemetery.net Death Hickam was killed in a landing accident at Fort Crockett, Galveston, Texas, on November 5, 1934.

Hickam, age 49, was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. On May 21, 1935, a new flying field at Honolulu, Hawaii, was designated Hickam Field, now Hickam Air Force Base. Additionally, Veterans Of Foreign Wars Post 970 is named after Hickam. The post is located next to the Air Force Base bearing his name.

It is commonly referred to as SAS. It was founded in February 1943 by Father Alan Rogers in his study at the parsonage of St Paul's, Vacoas, under the blessing of Bishop Hugh Otter-Barry. It was a non-fee paying school, the first coeducational and only Anglican secondary school in Mauritius.  History  St Andrew's was founded by Father Alan Rogers on 8 February 1943. The school began with 16 boys and girls as students. The next year in March 1944 the school moved to St Paul's Theological College opposite the present location in Ambrose Street, Rose Hill. This was made possible with the help of the Theological College. In May 1946, Canon Alan Rogers left, for health reasons, handing over the duties of Warden to the Rev. Thomas Pritchard, B.A. In September 1946, the 29-year-old Reverend Gordon Williams Mc Avan, A. K. C., Chaplain of Radley, took over as Warden, while Canon Rogers remained on the staff for a term as chaplain. By then the school's population was around 125. On 15 June 1950, the St Andrew's College Foundation was established by Ordinance No.30 of 1950 on the wish of Dr the Honourable Edgar Laurent, C.M.G., M.D., Lic-√®s-Sc. This was to enable the building of the School to be completed and to provide secondary education for Mauritian youth of both sexes. In 1952 the school entered its first candidates for the H.S.C. exams. In June 1961, in her Birthday Honours list, H.M. the Queen conferred the OBE on Canon Gordon Mc Avan in recognition of his devoted service to the cause of education. In February 1962, owing to health problems, Canon Mc Avan went on leave and did not come back, taking up instead parochial ministry in England. In July 1962 Mr John Russan, B.A., succeeded as Warden. December 1967 saw the departure of the last expatriate staff and appointment of the first Mauritian Warden, the Rev. Rex Donat at the head of a completely Mauritian staff. He had been a pupil of the school from 1948 to 1954 and also a member of the teaching staff of the school in 1961. Ham Koung [John] Ng Lung Kit became the first laureate (science side) of St Andrew's in February 1972; he later obtained his FRCS from Edinburgh Royal College of Surgeons and is today Managing Director of Clinique Mauricienne.) In May 1984, Rev. Rex Donat vacated his post to become Bishop of Mauritius and was succeeded by Mr Donald Runghen, B.A., P.G.C.E., as rector since the title of Warden was phased out. In 1995, Prof Goolam Mohamedbhai, former student of St Andrew's School was appointed as the Vice Chancellor of the University of Mauritius. On 1 October 2000, Mrs. Indira Manrakhan becomes the first lady rector of St Andrew's on the retirement of Mr Runghen and the Rev. Michael Chuttooa was appointed as Manager of the school. She was then succeeded by Mrs. Mirella Couronne in 2002 who kept her position as rector of the school until 2010 when she retired to be succeeded by Mrs Floriane Laventure who is currently managing the school.

His name is related to the Italian word \\"scappare\\" (to escape) and his name translates to ‚Äúlittle escape artist‚Äù in reference to his tendency to flee from fights, even those he himself begins. He has been dated to the last years of the 16th century, and his creation is sometimes credited to Niccol√≤ Barbieri.Niccol√≤ Barbieri He is a Bergamo native, and was popularized by the actor Francesco Gabrielli. Later versions show his costume with green (or sometimes turquoise) and white stripes, similar to Mezzetino's red and white, but Callot shows Scapino in an outfit similar to the early Brighella's, white with a tabaro and a sword on his belt, and topped with a torn hat adorned with feathers. He is in fact a variant on Brighella, more cowardly and less clever. Some people call him Brighella's brother, some his son. Scapino tends to make a confusion of anything he undertakes and metaphorically \\"flees\\" from one thought, activity or love interest to another, as his name implies, although he usually will return to it - eventually. Self-preservation and self-interest are his main concerns. This is not to say his wits are without merit. In Moli√®re's play Les Fourberies de Scapin, Zerbinette mentions what ‚Äúa clever servant [L√©andre] has. His name is Scapin. He is a most wonderful man and deserves the highest praise.‚Äù He is a schemer and scoundrel, and takes a certain pride in these facts. He was originally a masked character, although later versions usually have the actor simply powder his face. He is traditionally shown with a hooked nose and a pointed beard. Like Brighella, Scapino is a Jack-of-all- trades and depends on the needs of the scenario for his occupation. Scapino is depicted musically in William Walton's 1940 composition, Scapino: A Comedy Overture. A 1974 play of the same name adapted by Jim Dale and Frank Dunlop from Les Fourberies de Scapin by Moli√®re opened at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York in 1974.

Heaven has bestowed on me a fair enough share of genius for the making up of all those neat strokes of mother wit, for all those ingenious gallantries to which the ignorant and vulgar give the name of impostures; and I can boast, without vanity, that there have been very few men more skilful than I in expedients and intrigues, and who have acquired a greater reputation in the noble profession. But, to tell the truth, merit is too ill rewarded nowadays, and I have given up everything of the kind since the trouble I had through a certain affair that happened to me. OCTAVE: How? What affair, Scapin? SCAPIN: An adventure in which justice and I fell out. OCTAVE: Justice and you? SCAPIN: Yes; we had a trifling quarrel. SILVESTRE: You and justice? SCAPIN: Yes.

University of Hawaii Press, 1995 He was appointed to the office after the term of Bill Daniel. He was a member of the Democratic Party of Guam and was the first of native Chamorro descent to rise to the highest office in the territory. Early life Manuel F. Leon Guerrero was born in October 25, 1914 from his parents Jose L.G. Leon Guerrero (dec.) and Maria Lujan Flores (dec.) of Agana, and was the oldest of three children. World War II During the first days of the Japanese occupation of Guam, Leon Guerrero's role within Guam's Naval government made him a marked man. He spent the early days of the occupation with family in tow evading capture by hiding in the jungles of Guam. Along with many other of the Chamorro people, Leon Guerrero was eventually interned for a period by the Japanese military. Following his internment, he was forced to work on a manpower study made by the Japanese Military Government. During the remainder of the occupation, he supported his family by farming, except during periods he was assigned to forced labor camps with other Chamorros. Early Post-war career Leon Guerrero first served as a member of the Guam Congress from 1948-1950 as Chairman of the Finance Committee. He later became a leading member of the first Guam Legislature as Chairman of the Rules Committee and held several executive branch positions before his appointment as Secretary of Guam under Governor Bill Daniel. His other early public offices included: *Chairman of the Guam Land Transfer Board, 1950 *Special assistant to the Governor of Guam, 1951 *Acting Governor and Secretary of Guam at various times from 1950 to 1956 *Alternate Commissioner to the South Pacific Commission, 1962National Governors Association website Appointment During the years following World War II, Guam went through a series of gubernatorial appointments. Although Leon Guerrero continued to work in various civil positions, it wasn't until the appointment of Governor Bill Daniel that a true leadership opportunity emerged. Governor Daniel resigned from his position in September 1962, but his resignation was not accepted by President John F. Kennedy until January 1963. Meanwhile, Daniel went on a world tour during this period. After Daniel departed Guam, Leon Guerrero was left in charge, as the next highest public official, until a new governor was appointed. During this time, super typhoon Karen hit Guam in November 1962, destroying much of Guam and leaving Leon Guerrero to deal with the aftermath. Leon Guerrero dealt with the situation well, leading to his appointment as governor of Guam by President Kennedy. Governorship (1963‚Äì1969) First term During his first term as governor, Leon Guerrero established the Guam Tourist Commission, whose purpose was to move the island's economy away from military dependence to one based on commercial tourism. The Commission‚Äôs efforts were realized on May 1, 1967, when a Pan American World Airways flight arrived on Guam with 109 tourists from neighboring Japan. Over the course of that year, more than 6,000 visitors arrived on Guam.Guam PDN & Guam Visitor's Bureau As of the early 2000s, tourism now accounts for over a million visitors a year and is the leading industry of the island.Nations Encyclopedia Second term During the turbulent times of the Vietnam war, Governor Leon Guerrero was appointed to a second term by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1967.The American Presidency Project Although Leon Guerrero received much praise from Johnson for his leadership over the past term, Johnson felt the territorial island of 77,000 had matured and was ready to begin democratically electing its leaders. In 1970, Leon Guerrero entered the gubernatorial race under the democratic ticket. Leon Guerrero and running mate \\"Tony\\" Yamashita were narrowly defeated by the Ricardo Bordallo and Richard F. Taitano team in a contentious primary. Ultimately, Republican Carlos Camacho took the general election to become the first freely elected governor of Guam. Personal life Guerrero and his first wife Delfina Tuncap had seven children. The two divorced in the 1970s. Guerrero later married Antonia Rabon, and together, they had four children. Later years Guerrero was retired and died in Tamuning on October 9, 1985 when he is 70 years old. He was buried at the Guam Memorial Park in Leyang, Barrigada.

Within the nerve, axons targeting the same anatomical location are bundled together into groups known as fascicles, each surrounded by another protective sheath known as the perineurium. Several fascicles may be in turn bundled together with a blood supply and fatty tissue within yet another sheath, the epineurium. This grouping structure is analogous to the muscular organization system of epimysium, perimysium and endomysium. The perineurium is composed of connective tissue, which has a distinctly lamellar arrangement consisting of one to several concentric layers. The perineurium is composed of perineurial cells, which are epithelioid myofibroblasts. Perineurial cells are sometimes referred to as myoepithelioid due to their epithelioid and myofibroblastoid properties including tight junctions, gap junctions, external laminae and contractility. The tight junctions provide selective barrier to chemical substances. The perineurium is a smooth, transparent tubular membrane which may be easily separated from the fibers it encloses. In contrast, the epineurium is a tough and mechanically resistant tissue which is not easily penetrated by a needle.

Its component cells are called endoneurial cells. The endoneuria with their enclosed nerve fibers are bundled into groups called nerve fascicles, each fascicle within its own protective sheath called a perineurium. In sufficiently large nerves multiple fascicles, each with its blood supply and fatty tissue, may be bundled within yet another sheath, the epineurium. The endoneurium contains a liquid known as endoneurial fluid, which contains little protein. In the peripheral nervous system the endoneurial fluid is notionally equivalent to cerebro-spinal fluid in the central nervous system. Peripheral nerve injuries commonly release increased amounts of endoneurial fluid into surrounding tissues; these can be detected by magnetic resonance neurography, thereby assisting in locating injuries to peripheral nerves. The endoneurium runs longitudinally along the nerve fiber, but with discontinuities where septa pass inward from the innermost layer of the perineurium. It contains fine bundles of fibrous connective tissue, primarily collagen, embedded in a matrix of ground substance. This structure serves to support capillary blood vessels, arranged so as to form a network of elongated meshes.

About of beach are accessible by vehicle and 35 additional miles are accessible only by boat. Matagorda is at the end of State Highway 60 and beginning of Farm to Market Road 2031, which runs over the Intracoastal Waterway and south to the Gulf of Mexico. History Matagorda is the third-oldest town in Texas. It was established in 1827 when Stephen F. Austin obtained permission from the Mexican government to build a town to protect incoming settlers. Elias R. Wightman, who was one of Stephen F. Austin's early surveyors, traveled to Matagorda in 1829 with 60 immigrant settlers. Twenty-four historical markers are in the township of Matagorda. Activities The most popular activity in Matagorda is visiting the beach. It is a fishing hot spot on the Texas coast. It provides access to both East and West Matagorda Bays, Matagorda Beach, and the Gulf of Mexico. Matagorda is known as one of the best kayaking and kayak fishing destinations on the Texas coast due to miles of shallow marsh area only accessible by kayak. Miles of designated paddling trails are in the Matagorda area. Matagorda County has been number-one in the nation since 1997 in the North American Audubon Christmas Bird Count with 234 different species spotted. Among the more impressive species which have been reported are the prairie warbler, common poorwill, broad-winged hawk, MacGillivray's warbler, and Swainson's warbler.

The Old Commerce building at the University of Melbourne is the relocated facade of a Collins Street bank which was superimposed on the front of a \\"new\\" campus building in the 1930s. Preservation of a 19th-century facade, Noordereiland, Rotterdam Reverse fa√ßadism: New construction with an old-looking fa√ßade hung in front of a cast concrete wall, as built in the Dom-R√∂mer Project in Frankfurt am Main. Facadism, fa√ßadism, or fa√ßadomy is the architectural and construction practice where the facade of a building is designed or constructed separately from the rest of a building, or when only the facade of a building is preserved with new buildings erected behind or around it. There are aesthetic and historical reasons for preserving building facades. Facadism can be the response to the interiors of a building becoming unusable, such as being damaged by fire. In developing areas, however, the practice is sometimes used by property developers seeking to redevelop a site as a compromise with preservationists who wish to preserve buildings of historical or aesthetic interest. It can be regarded as a compromise between historic preservation and demolition and thus has been lauded as well as decried. There is sometimes a blurred line between renovation, adaptive reuse, reconstruction and facadism. Sometimes buildings are renovated to such an extent that they are \\"skinned\\", preserving only the exterior shell, and used for purposes other than those for which they were originally intended. While this is equivalent to facadism, the difference is typically the retention of roof and or floor structures, maintaining a credible link to the original building. In contrast, facadism generally involves retaining only one or two street facing walls for purely aesthetic and decorative purposes. Facadomy is a practice in postmodern architecture reaching its peak in the latter half of the 20th century. The setback or podium architecture technique gives an illusion of integrity to the original building by visually separating the old from the new, helping to mitigate farcical effects such as the floors and windows not lining up or a dramatic clash of styles. Critics label the practice as architectural sham, claiming that it sometimes results in part of the building becoming a folly. Distribution and control measures Despite being highly controversial and denounced by many preservationists as vandalism, facadism is used as the demand for new development is overwhelming community desires for preservation. Facadism appears often in cities where there is a strong pressure for new development. While the controversial practice of facadism is encouraged by governments in some cities (such as Toronto and Brisbane), it is actively discouraged in others (such as Paris and Sydney). Architectural podiums are often seen by some architects as a solution to this problem and these are allowed for as part of planning frameworks in urban heritage areas. International policies The practice of facadism conflicts with ICOMOS international charters. The Venice Charter, article 7, states that: \\"A monument is inseparable from the history to which it bears witness and from the setting in which it occurs. The moving of all or part of a monument cannot be allowed except where the safeguarding of that monument demands it or where it is justified by national or international interest of paramount importance\\". By country Australia In Australia, the Burra Charter, which sets out the principles and procedures to be followed when conserving heritage places, does not have any policies which specifically deal with facadism. However, it requires that all aspects of the significance of a place be understood and retained as far as possible. Many local governments have heritage policies, but while some specifically warn against facadism, others do not. = Sydney = The central city of Sydney sported numerous examples of historic buildings reduced to facades as part of the development boom of the 1980s. The retention of only the two street facades of the 1890s Colonial Mutual Building on Martin Place in 1976 to allow an office tower behind is probably the earliest example of facadism in Australia, and set a precedent for the following decade. The most notorious was the treatment of the 1850s North British Hotel in Loftus Street in 1983, where the bland office building facade rose straight up from the retained facade, and had been given the bonus floors on the basis of the preservation. In 2018, a new development on a larger site saw its complete demolition, noting that it was not officially heritage protected. Many warehouses and industrial buildings in the central city area were facaded in the 1980s, some left propped up for years after the building boom bust in the early 1990s. New heritage controls introduced in NSW allow the listing of interiors, and many now are, and the City of Sydney heritage guidelines assume the retention of the whole of buildings that are heritage listed, and so there have been very few examples of facadism since the mid 1990s. =Melbourne= In the rapidly growing city of Melbourne, facadism has become very common. The Old Commerce building at the University of Melbourne was a very early example dating from the 1930s, however this was a case of saving an elaborate stone bank facade by relocating it to Melbourne University and reconstructed as part of a new building (which was itself demolished and replaced in 2014 with the facade left in place). With the introduction of heritage controls in the 1980s, and high profile heritage battles over a number of several large scale CBD buildings, a compromise policy avoiding facadism was generally adopted. The front portion, often about 10 metres depth of the front of a building was retained, with taller development setback behind the retained portion. One Collins Street in 1984 and the Olderfleet group development in 1986 were high profile examples. Facadism still occurred in a few examples, notably the T & G Building on Collins Street where 10 storey walls on two street fronts were propped up in 1990 allowing a completely new building behind, but the same height and floor levels as the facades. In the early 21st century, with development pressures increasing, and policies introduced encouraging high density residential development, new non-specific controls in the central city, and a series of decisions at the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, retention of only facades has become more and more common. By the early 2010s, industrial buildings, shop rows, and traditional corner pubs across the inner and middle city were routinely reduced to a facade (and usually some side walls to retain the appearance of a 'three dimensional building'), to allow new residential construction behind and above. In 2012 the huge Myer Store on Lonsdale Street in the city was reduced to a highly visible propped facade to allow the construction of a shopping center. Concern was expressed by heritage groups in 2013 that the trend has gone too far, and the City of Melbourne started the process for introducing new guidelines for the central city that would curb such practices. =Brisbane= In Brisbane, where heritage controls did not exist until 1992, many historic buildings were lost completely despite public opposition in the 1970s and 80s, and facadism was seen as an acceptable compromise by the Brisbane City Council. The Myer Centre, completed in 1988 was hailed as a heritage 'success', retaining the facades of several buildings including the Hotel Carlton (1885), New York Hotel (1860) and Newspaper House. Another notorious example was the Queensland Country Life Building (1888) which was reduced to a facade in 1991, and left as a remnant for many years until a development was built behind in 2006. Guidelines for places on the State level Queensland Heritage Register however requires that interiors specifically taken into account. Canada In Canada, all jurisdictions at the federal, provincial, territorial and municipal level have adopted the Standards & Guidelines for the Conservation of Historic Places in Canada, which does not recommend, though not explicit, facadism as good conservation practice. In general, projects which have approached projects using facadism are considered to have lost their integrity and value. Nonetheless, facadism is very common, especially in Toronto, for example in 2017 the facades of the McLaughlin Motor Car Showroom were dismantled and re-erected as part of the Burano tower development.

Famed for their sponsorship of schools and knowledge of history and Early Irish law, the U√≠ Dhuibh d√° Bhoireann were known throughout Ireland as a literary family and held estates in the Burren down to the mid seventeenth century at the time of the Cromwellian confiscations. Many acted as brehons for the local ruling dynasty of U√≠ Loughlin from the 14th century or earlier. Origins The O'Davorens, like the O'Hehirs and some other septs west of the Shannon in County Clare Ireland, belonged to the Eoghanacht stock claiming name and descent from the son of Aengus, King of Cashel, slain 957. The family settled in Burren in mediaeval times, exact date unknown. We first hear of them as hereditary ollamhs to the O'Loghlens of that district, who are of the race of Fergus mac Roigh, of Ulster. The earliest reference to them in print is in the Annals of the Four Masters under the year 1364, where the death of Giolla na Naomh √ì Duibh d√° Bhoireann, ollamh of Corcomdhruadh in Brehon law, is recorded. Excavation The O'Davoren law school at Cahermacnaghten has been the subject of archaeological and historical interest and its remains are still extant. The law school operated in the sixteenth and seventeenth century, with a Giolla na Naomh √ìg √ì Duibh d√° Bhoireann being recorded as one of its chief owners in the seventeenth century. The O'Davorens's were recorded as still holding Cahermacnaghten in 1659, along with 13 Irish tenants. Literary Production The most important surviving document associated with them is known as Egerton 88 (British Library), being compiled between 1564 and 1569.

They are most often caused when stratified squamous epithelium of the ectocervix (portion nearest to the vagina) grows over the simple columnar epithelium of the endocervix (portion nearest to the uterus). This tissue growth can block the cervical crypts (subdermal pockets usually 2‚Äì10 mm in diameter), trapping cervical mucus inside the crypts. Presentation Nabothian cysts appear most often as firm bumps on the cervix's surface. A woman may notice the cyst when inserting a diaphragm or cervical cap, or when checking the cervix as part of fertility awareness. A health care provider may notice the cysts during a pelvic exam. Nabothian cysts are also incidentally found during MRI imaging. During the healing process of chronic cervicitis, squamous epithelium of ectocervix proliferates and enter the cervical canal (endocervix), covering and obstructing the columnar epithelium of endocervical glands. Thus, retention of mucus in the endocervical glands causes cyst formation. The size of the cyst may vary from a few millimetres to 4 cm in diameter. Diagnosis If a cyst has an unusual appearance, a colposcopy will be performed to rule out other diagnoses. If the blood vessels are short, comma-like or corkscrew-shaped and bleed on contact, then the cyst may be a very rare mucin-producing carcinoma of the cervix. Magnetic resonance imaging is used to distinguish cancer from the typical nabothian cyst. T1-weighted MRI imaging would show intermediate to high intensity while T2-weighted imaging would show high signal intensity. Findings of solid components separating multiple cysts would be suggestive of adenoma malignum (a form of cervical cancer). Treatment Color MRI showing Nabothian cyst as small blue circle in cervical region. Nabothian cysts usually require no treatment and frequently resolve on their own. Cryotherapy has been used to treat nabothian cysts but is rarely necessary. Very rarely a cyst may be so large that it prevents a clinician from performing a pap smear, in which case the clinician may puncture the cyst with a needle and drain it. If nabothian cysts occur with chronic cervicitis (inflammation of the cervix) then the underlying cause of the inflammation must be treated. Eponym Nabothian cysts are also known as nabothian follicles, mucinous retention cysts, or epithelial inclusion cysts. They are named after German anatomist Martin Naboth (1675‚Äì1721), who wrote about them in a 1707 treatise titled De sterilitate mulierum. However, they were earlier described by French surgeon Guillaume Desnoues (1650‚Äì1735). Since it is a derived term, nabothian is not spelled with a capital first letter.

History The college began in 1977 as the Wasco Area Education Service District, which not long after was changed to Treaty Oak Education Service District. The original incarnation of the college operated in leased facilities in downtown The Dalles for 16 years. In 1989, a public vote changed the college's designation from a service district to a community college, and later its name was changed to Columbia Gorge Community College. In 1993, a bond election allowed for the purchase and remodeling of the current campus facility, a former hospital. In 2001, voters in Wasco County and Hood River County approved the annexation of Hood River County to the college's service district. The Hood River Center operated out of rented facilities near the waterfront in Hood River County. In 2008, the college completed construction of its new campus in Hood River and a new Health Sciences Building on its campus in The Dalles. In 2013, the college became independently accredited. In 2018, Dr. Marta Yera-Cronin became president of the college. Cronin was formerly vice president of academic affairs at Indian River State College in Port St. Lucie, Fla. The college announced in 2018 that they would be building a new skill center and student housing building, being opened in the fall term of 2021. The college will also be adding 5 new programs starting in the fall term of 2021 including Aviation maintenance technician, Construction Trades, Pre-Construction Apprenticeship, HVAC installation and maintenance, and Welding. The college also plans adding other programs including Fire Science and Cyber security in the near future.https://www.mcedd.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CGCC-Presentation- Skills-Center-Student-Housing-1.pdf Accreditation The college is accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities.

Both refer to the phasor in the complex plane whose real and imaginary parts are the resistive (lossy) component of an electromagnetic field and its reactive (lossless) counterpart. Electromagnetic field perspective For time varying electromagnetic fields, the electromagnetic energy is typically viewed as waves propagating either through free space, in a transmission line, in a microstrip line, or through a waveguide. Dielectrics are often used in all of these environments to mechanically support electrical conductors and keep them at a fixed separation, or to provide a barrier between different gas pressures yet still transmit electromagnetic power. Maxwell‚Äôs equations are solved for the electric and magnetic field components of the propagating waves that satisfy the boundary conditions of the specific environment's geometry. In such electromagnetic analyses, the parameters permittivity Œµ, permeability Œº, and conductivity œÉ represent the properties of the media through which the waves propagate. The permittivity can have real and imaginary components (the latter excluding œÉ effects, see below) such that : \\\\varepsilon = \\\\varepsilon' - j \\\\varepsilon . If we assume that we have a wave function such that : \\\\mathbf E = \\\\mathbf E_{o}e^{j \\\\omega t}, then Maxwell's curl equation for the magnetic field can be written as: : abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf H = j \\\\omega \\\\varepsilon' \\\\mathbf E + ( \\\\omega \\\\varepsilon + \\\\sigma )\\\\mathbf E where Œµ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ is the imaginary component of permittivity attributed to bound charge and dipole relaxation phenomena, which gives rise to energy loss that is indistinguishable from the loss due to the free charge conduction that is quantified by œÉ. The component Œµ‚Ä≤ represents the familiar lossless permittivity given by the product of the free space permittivity and the relative real/absolute permittivity, or Œµ‚Ä≤ = Œµ0Œµ‚Ä≤r.  Loss tangent  The loss tangent is then defined as the ratio (or angle in a complex plane) of the lossy reaction to the electric field E in the curl equation to the lossless reaction: : \\\\tan \\\\delta = \\\\frac{\\\\omega \\\\varepsilon + \\\\sigma} {\\\\omega \\\\varepsilon'} . For dielectrics with small loss, this angle is ‚â™ 1 and tan Œ¥ ‚âà Œ¥. After some further calculations to obtain the solution for the fields of the electromagnetic wave, it turns out that the power decays with propagation distance z as :P = P_o e^{-\\\\delta k z}, where: :*Po is the initial power, :*k = \\\\omega \\\\sqrt{\\\\mu \\\\varepsilon'} = \\\\tfrac {2 \\\\pi} {\\\\lambda} , :*œâ is the angular frequency of the wave, and :*Œª is the wavelength in the dielectric material. There are often other contributions to power loss for electromagnetic waves that are not included in this expression, such as due to the wall currents of the conductors of a transmission line or waveguide. Also, a similar analysis could be applied to the magnetic permeability where : \\\\mu = \\\\mu' - j \\\\mu , with the subsequent definition of a magnetic loss tangent : \\\\tan \\\\delta_m = \\\\frac{\\\\mu} {\\\\mu'} . The electric loss tangent can be similarly defined: : \\\\tan \\\\delta_e = \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon} {\\\\varepsilon'} , upon introduction of an effective dielectric conductivity (see relative permittivity#Lossy medium). Discrete circuit perspective For every discrete electrical circuit components, a capacitor is typically made of a dielectric placed between conductors. The lumped element model of a capacitor includes a lossless ideal capacitor in series with a resistor termed the equivalent series resistance (ESR), as shown in the figure below. The ESR represents losses in the capacitor. In a low-loss capacitor the ESR is very small (the conduction is low leading to a high resistivity), and in a lossy capacitor the ESR can be large. Note that the ESR is not simply the resistance that would be measured across a capacitor by an ohmmeter. The ESR is a derived quantity representing the loss due to both the dielectric's conduction electrons and the bound dipole relaxation phenomena mentioned above. In a dielectric, one of the conduction electrons or the dipole relaxation typically dominates loss in a particular dielectric and manufacturing method. For the case of the conduction electrons being the dominant loss, then : \\\\mathrm{ESR} = \\\\frac {\\\\sigma} {\\\\varepsilon' \\\\omega^2 C} where C is the lossless capacitance. A real capacitor has a lumped element model of a lossless ideal capacitor in series with an equivalent series resistance (ESR). The loss tangent is defined by the angle between the capacitor's impedance vector and the negative reactive axis. When representing the electrical circuit parameters as vectors in a complex plane, known as phasors, a capacitor's loss tangent is equal to the tangent of the angle between the capacitor's impedance vector and the negative reactive axis, as shown in the adjacent diagram. The loss tangent is then : \\\\tan \\\\delta = \\\\frac {\\\\mathrm{ESR}} {|X_{c}|} = \\\\omega C \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{ESR} = \\\\frac {\\\\sigma} {\\\\varepsilon' \\\\omega} . Since the same AC current flows through both ESR and Xc, the loss tangent is also the ratio of the resistive power loss in the ESR to the reactive power oscillating in the capacitor. For this reason, a capacitor's loss tangent is sometimes stated as its dissipation factor, or the reciprocal of its quality factor Q, as follows : \\\\tan \\\\delta = \\\\mathrm{DF} = \\\\frac {1} {Q} .

It has over 1000 pupils ranging from ages 11 to 18, and has its own sixth form. History KGGS was founded in 1910 by Miss H Gladys Williams. . Before its establishment Kesteven Local Education Authority had founded the Grantham Institute, which accepted girls. A decision to found a new county grammar school for girls was made by a joint committee of county, borough and town councils. After the Board of Education recognised Grantham Institute as a secondary grammar school, and the girls' aspect within it, they appointed a principal mistress for the Institute, who would become the headmistress of a 1910 newly built school called Kesteven and Grantham Girls' Grammar School.Wickstead, Arthur, in chapter 10, \\"Education for all Children\\", in Twentieth Century Lincolnshire, editor Dennis R. Mills, History of Lincolnshire Committee for the Society of Lincolnshire History and Archaeology (1989), pp.258, 259. The former prime minister Margaret Thatcher had been a pupil at the school between 1936 and 1943, head girl in her final year. Teen author Beverley Naidoo opened the English Department in November 2001. The school was awarded dual specialisms in Language and Science. Curriculum The school is located near the boys' grammar school, The King's School, and a small number of KGGS pupils take some lessons there at A Level, in a reciprocal arrangement allowing a few King's pupils to take some lessons at KGGS. Form and house activity Each form has a form captain and deputy, two school council members and two charity representatives. Form captains deal with problems and represent the form. A school council discusses matters and acts to improve the school and its community. Charity events are organised by forms to raise money for good causes, with a trophy given each year to the form which raises the most. Pupils are allotted to one of six houses within the school, named after famous female writers and poets: Austen, Bront√´, Browning, Eliot, Potter, and Rossetti. Each house has its own colour: Austen- Purple, Potter-Green, Rossetti-Red, Bronte-White, Browning-Black and Eliot- Yellow. Houses are headed by two Year 13 house captains. The house system is maintained and supervised by three Year 13 house secretaries and one member of staff. House events include a sports day, a pantomime, choir, netball, badminton, rounders, debating, public speaking, general knowledge and dance. House pantomimes and choirs have an important place in the school's calendar each year. House assemblies are held each term, where house captains inform pupils of news, plans and ideas surrounding house events, and encourage participation in activities. Sport The school won the U-19 Championships of the English Schools' Table Tennis Association (ESTTA) three times in a row from 2009‚Äì11, and had also won it, 1986‚Äì88; the representative of the English Table Tennis Association for the East Midlands, Suzanne Airey, went to KGGS.Table tennis Extracurricular activity There are school exchange programmes with Germany, France and Japan; many girls undertake one of these opportunities each year. The school's connection with Minami High School, Fukushima, Japan, involves a group of Japanese students visiting Grantham each year. A group of girls taking Spanish GCSE or A Level were recently invited to take part in a Spanish exchange in conjunction with Carre's Grammar School, Sleaford. Peripatetic teachers run lessons in various instruments and singing. Music clubs include a school choir, female barber shop quintet, orchestra, wind band, and string group. There is a composing club, and a 'Junk group' in which students make Stomp-style music using items such as brooms, cardboard boxes and phone books. There is also an occasional magazine called News4u. Curriculum support and revision sessions are held, some for GCSE, AS or A-level. The school runs the Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme, and school sports teams and individuals compete at a national level. KGGS holds classes that are open to the public, such as GCSE in Statistics and Digital Imaging, and GCE AS level in Science in Society.

She spent late November and early December in the West Indies conducting training and then returned to Norfolk where she occupied the rest of the year and the first quarter of 1952 preparing for her first deployment to the Mediterranean. On 18 April 1952, the escort destroyer departed Norfolk, loaded ammunition, and headed for Tangier, Morocco. Following Mediterranean operations in mid-May, Basilone visited Sicily; Marseilles, France; Naples, Italy; and Gibraltar before leaving the Mediterranean on 17 June. After a brief replenishment stop in the Azores, the warship stood into Norfolk on the 28th. With the exceptions of an amphibious exercise at Onslow Beach, North Carolina, in August and a repair period at the New York Naval Shipyard in September, she spent most of the summer close to Norfolk until deploying to the Mediterranean once again on 22 September. Basilone reached Tangier on 6 October and touched briefly at Gibraltar before joining the 6th Fleet. Aside from the usual operations, the escort destroyer visited Naples; Augusta Bay, Sicily; Cannes, France; and Algiers, Algeria before departing the Mediterranean via Gibraltar on 26 November. Basilone returned to Norfolk early in December and began a period of leave and upkeep. At the end of the first week in 1953, she resumed normal operations out of Norfolk and remained so engaged until the beginning of February when she headed south to the West Indies to carry out several weeks of anti-submarine warfare (ASW) drills. Late in March, the warship reentered Norfolk to prepare for another tour of duty with the 6th Fleet. She put to sea on her way back to the Mediterranean on 17 April. Basilone served with the 6th Fleet for about three months, returning to Norfolk late in June. The escort destroyer then entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for a brief availability before making a series of short cruises from her homeport to Key West, Mayport, Florida, and San Juan, Puerto Rico In September, she operated locally out of Norfolk and then underwent a tender availability in October preparatory to beginning a three-month regular overhaul at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 4 November. Basilone completed the repair and maintenance work on 11 February 1954 and resumed an active employment schedule. She sailed south to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, whence she completed her post-overhaul refresher training. After returning to Norfolk in mid-April, the warship readied herself to deploy to the Mediterranean once more, embarking on that assignment on 4 May. Basilone participated in 6th Fleet exercises throughout the summer months and, while doing so, called at ports from Algeria to Turkey. She spent considerable time off the French Riviera where took part in festivities celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Allied landings in World War II. In September, she headed back to the United States, arriving back in Norfolk on 28 September. After a tender availability, Basilone resumed a normal schedule of operations, largely competitive division exercises conducted locally off the Virginia Capes during November. 1955‚Äì1962 February and March 1955 found Basilone under the operational control of ComAntiSubLant participating in a series of ASW helicopter evaluation exercises. She spent most of April in port at Norfolk undergoing a tender availability and carried out type training near the Virginia Capes in May. From early June to early August, the warship took part in a midshipman training cruise to European waters, during which she visited Valencia, Spain; Weymouth, England; and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Basilone returned to Norfolk on 4 August and commenced a pre-overhaul tender availability that she had to interrupt twice to get underway to evade two hurricanes. Finally though, after almost three weeks of service to the Operational Development Force, the escort destroyer entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 13 September to begin a three-month overhaul. Basilone completed the repairs just in time to return to Norfolk for Christmas. Basilone spent the first quarter of 1956 pierside at Norfolk. In April, when she finally did get underway, she ventured only as far as the waters of Chesapeake Bay. At the end of April, however, the warship embarked on a training cruise that took her to the West Indies. Returning to Norfolk in mid- June, Basilone spent the summer of 1956 engaged first in a familiarization cruise for West Point Cadets and then in a training cruise for Naval Academy midshipmen to Halifax, Nova Scotia. In September, she participated in Exercise \\"New Broom VI\\" then toured NATO countries for advanced ASW exercises. In November, the destroyer escort sailed to the Mediterranean to supplement the 6th Fleet during the Suez Crisis. Basilone returned to Norfolk in mid- December. Over the next five years, the warship continued to alternate tours of duty with the 6th Fleet with periods of service along the east coast and in the West Indies while based at Norfolk. During her deployment to the Mediterranean Sea in the summer of 1958, Basilone joined other 6th Fleet units in patrolling the coast of Lebanon in response to internal political upheavals in that country. In 1962, however, a break came in her east coast- Mediterranean cycle of operations. After conducting local ASW exercises during mid-January and making a futile round-trip voyage to Mayport, Florida, and back late in the month to support the recovery of Col. John Glenn's Mercury flight which had to be delayed because of weather and technical difficulties, Basilone again departed Norfolk on 17 February along with her eight DesRon 36 squadron mates to rendezvous with the aircraft carrier for the voyage across the Atlantic. The task group paused near Bermuda to assist with the recovery of Col. Glenn's space capsule and then resumed the journey to northern European waters. The task group stopped at Portsmouth, England, between 28 February and 7 March and visited Rotterdam in the Netherlands from the 15th to the 22nd. From Rotterdam, the warships crossed the North Sea to call at Glasgow, Scotland, between 30 March and 5 April and carried out exercises in nearby waters until 8 April when they moored at Moville, Ireland. After a visit to Plymouth from 12 April to 24, Basilone recrossed the North Sea early in May to stop at Flensburg, Germany, for 10 days from the 4th to the 14th. The escort destroyer and her colleagues then spent a week at Moss, Norway, between 21 May and 28 and conducted more exercises at sea before returning to Norfolk on 16 June. Basilone stayed in port at Norfolk until early August. On 7 August, the same day that she resumed local underway activity, the warship was reclassified a destroyer and redesignated DD-824. The destroyer conducted ASW training with Wasp and the submarine and then paid a visit to New York City from 18 August to 22. During the month between 23 August and 24 September, Basilone carried out normal training missions in the Virginia Capes operating area. Near the end of September, she left Norfolk on her way south for and extended period of drills and exercises in the West Indies. The eruption of the Cuban Missile Crisis in mid-October, found Basilone still engaged in training operations out of Guantanamo Bay. She immediately joined the \\"quarantine\\" of Cuba that finally forced the removal of the Russian nuclear missiles from the island; Basilone served on the quarantine from 24 October to 18 November 1962. 1963‚Äì1966 She returned to Norfolk for the last weeks of 1962. After holiday stand down, the warship resumed local operations during the second week of January 1963. In mid-February, Basilone returned to the West Indies where she carried out a month of training near Puerto Rico. She reentered Norfolk on 21 March and, for the next ten weeks, got underway infrequently and only operated locally. In June 1963 Basilone was assigned North Atlantic duties to provide a homing beacon off the coast of Ireland for President Kennedy's pending flight to Europe. While on station for the flight, Basilone sustained a serious crack in her hull near the keel during a severe North Atlantic storm. (Waves were estimated to be at approximately in size) The crack was leaking over a minute and was getting worse. Welding repairs attempts were unsuccessful and an emergency repair attempt at the shipyard in Londonderry, Ireland away was denied. Basilone was ordered to stay on station until Air Force One radioed receipt of Basilones homing beacon. Basilone was then to be immediately released approximately 25 June for return to Norfolk, Virginia. D & S Piers for a pierside repair attempt. When the pierside repair attempt was deemed unsuccessful, Basilone was dispatched to Yorktown, Virginia, to unload ammunition and then sent on to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for drydock repairs on the hull. In preparation for overhaul and modernization she left Norfolk on 27 July bound for the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. From July 1963 to 26 April 1964, Basilone underwent a Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM I) overhaul at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. Modifications completed, the destroyer followed her arrival at her new homeport of Newport, Rhode Island, on 1 May with three weeks of shakedown training at Newport and Norfolk. On 18 May 1964, she departed Newport to fulfill a familiar role as sonar school training ship at Key West en route to the West Indies where the warship underwent refresher training during June and the first half of July. Upon arrival back at Newport on 24 July, Basilone enjoyed three weeks of leave and tender availability. For a week in August and over two weeks in September, she participated in ASW operations that included two fleet exercises. After three more weeks of upkeep and another assignment to the sonar school at Key West, the destroyer sailed to Guantanamo Bay to act as a gunfire support duty ship during the last week of October. On 27 November, following three weeks of preparation at Newport, Basilone commenced a four-month tour of duty with the 6th Fleet, serving primarily in the screen of a carrier task force in the western Mediterranean and visiting ports in Spain, Italy, and Majorca. Following her return to Norfolk in March 1965, upkeep, maintenance, and the installation of a drone antisubmarine helicopter (DASH) system occupied her attention until early June. From late June until early September, midshipman summer training cruises took up most of the destroyer's time. During this period, Basilone also took part in numerous antisubmarine warfare (ASW) exercises, many of which were carried out in cooperation with British, Canadian, and German naval units. Although tender availability at Newport occupied the destroyer for most of the rest of 1965, she did get underway to aid the aborted Gemini VI mission in October and spent two weeks engaged in ASW and amphibious exercises involving substantial Atlantic Fleet forces early in December. On 26 January 1966, a week after departing Newport, Basilone transited the Panama Canal to complete the first leg of her passage to join Task Force 77 (TF 77) on Dixie Station off South Vietnam. After 10 days plane-guarding the aircraft carrier , the destroyer closed the shore to provide gunfire support in the IV Corps area from 14 to 19 March. She briefly assumed a picket station in the Tonkin Gulf before steaming to Subic Bay and Hong Kong for rest and replenishment. On 9 April, Basilone rejoined Ticonderoga, this time for two weeks on Yankee Station off North Vietnam. Following a 15-day availability at Kaohsiung, Taiwan, she sailed to waters off II Corps area on 7 May to provide gunfire support, including a two-day trip up the Saigon River to bombard Viet Cong targets on the 24th. After departing the Saigon River, she contributed her firepower to an air attack and shore landing against a concentration of the Viet Cong. After another tender availability at Taiwan, Basilone returned to the II Corps area on 10 June where frequent requests for gunfire support kept her busy. On 4 July, the warship stood into Subic Bay in preparation for a return trip to Newport via the Suez Canal and Gibraltar. On 17 August, Basilone arrived at Newport and commenced a month-long tender upkeep before resuming local ASW operations. During the remainder of 1966, she only interrupted this pattern for a two-day liberty in Bermuda in mid-November and a major Atlantic Fleet exercise. 1967‚Äì1970 During the latter half of January 1967, Basilone twice sailed to the Virginia Capes for type training that lasted four days and a week, respectively. A two-week tender availability alongside the destroyer tender preceded her departure for refresher training on 13 February. On 10 March, the warship put into the Boston Naval Shipyard to receive a new 5-inch gun mount in place of one severely damaged in a storm the previous November. On 11 April, she sailed to Newport where preparations commenced for another Mediterranean deployment. Basilone got underway for European waters on 2 May and changed operational control to the 6th Fleet at Gibraltar nine days later, and set sail for operations off southern Italy the next day. As tensions escalated between Egypt and Israel before the Six-Day War, the destroyer joined other 6th Fleet units on alert status. After 29 days at sea, she stopped at Souda Bay, Crete, on 9 June long enough to embark midshipmen for a training cruise. Most of the month's activities consisted of exercises with TF 60 off Crete with the exceptions of liberty calls at Souda Bay and Valletta, Malta. On 3 July, problems with a service generator forced the warship back to Crete for repairs. During July, she remained at Crete performing administrative duties as the only American ship present until relieved on the 23rd. Basilone conducted ASW surveillance operations and port visits to southern France, Menorca, and Malta prior to departing Rota, Spain on 12 September. Upon returning to Newport, upkeep and training exercises occupied the destroyer prior to serving as an ASW school ship at Naval Station Key West, Florida Following her return to Newport on 11 December, Basilone moored alongside the destroyer tender in preparation for an upcoming overhaul at the Boston Naval Shipyard which commenced on 11 January 1968. In addition to the usual aspects of an overhaul, she improved her communications, electronics, and sonar equipment before returning to Newport on 21 May. The destroyer conducted refresher training at Guantanamo Bay during June and July then returned to Newport for a month of upkeep, local operations, and preparations for a scheduled deployment to a 7th Fleet assignment. However, the warship received orders to deploy to the 6th Fleet instead. Basilone departed Newport on 5 September and relieved the destroyer at Majorca 11 days later. Following a five-day stay at Malta, the warship participated in the surveillance of the Soviet helicopter carrier until 4 November when she shadowed the helicopter and towed sonar flattop to the entrance of the Dardanelles then put into Kavalla, Greece, for a week. En route to Majorca, Basilone participated in a NATO exercise in the Aegean Sea then stood into Naples on 7 December for a 12-day tender availability. The destroyer finished the year in Cannes, France (port was made in Toulon France), joining Exercise \\"Lafayette\\" during her four-day transit. On 3 January 1969, she got underway for 10 days of task group operations after which she visited Tunis en route to turnover at Majorca on the 18th. After reaching Newport on the 30th, Basilone underwent leave and upkeep, including a tender availability alongside the destroyer tender . On 13 March, she began training officers attending the Destroyer School. On 8 April, the destroyer completed the training assignment and returned to Newport for another tender availability. Engineering problems delayed her departure until 19 May, after which she took part in two fleet exercises, one of which included NATO forces. Following upkeep and inspections that occupied her from 13 June to 22 July, Basilone participated in ASW exercises with 2nd Fleet units and then carried out torpedo and ASW missile exercises in the West Indies. Upon her return to Newport on 26 August, she began a three-week tender availability in preparation for a 7th Fleet assignment. However, the warship received orders to deploy to the 6th Fleet instead, while another availability to correct boiler problems kept her in port until 11 November. The next day, the destroyer steered the familiar course to the Mediterranean and relieved the destroyer on 21 November. Aside from the usual task force operations, Basilone visited Malta; Tunis; ƒ∞zmir, Turkey; Athens, Greece; and Naples, Italy. Her return to Newport on 22 May afforded the ship and crew a much anticipated two months of rest and replenishment. With the exception of two days of pre-deployment ASW services provided to the submarine in late July and a four-day port visit to New York City early in August, Basilone remained in Newport hosting the sailors' families, Navy War College staff members and students and acting as a spectator ship for the 1970 America's Cup yacht race. On 23 September, the destroyer was relieved of that assignment and once again set sail for the Eastern Mediterranean to participate in task force operations in support of King Hussein of Jordan during the Black September conflict. During this episode, Basilone changed operational control to the 6th Fleet on 2 October. Aside from task force operations and gunnery exercises, she paid visits to Crete, Athens, Naples, and Majorca before rejoining the 2d Fleet on 2 November. On the 8th, the warship returned to Newport for leave and upkeep. 1971‚Äì1973 Early in 1971, Basilone twice sailed to the Bahamas. During the first two weeks of February, she participated in an ASW exercise off Andros Island then returned to the Tongue of the Ocean for three weeks late in April and early in May as part of a Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) project evaluating the Mark 48 torpedo. With the exception of brief training at Norfolk in May, the destroyer remained in Newport until 16 August preparing for overhaul at the Boston Naval Shipyard. After completing the overhaul on 24 November, Basilone again steamed to the Bahamas for weapons' tests and exercises. On 15 December, she returned to Newport for leave and upkeep. On 3 January 1972, the warship sailed to the West Indies for refresher training then returned to Newport on 13 February. With the exception of training off the Virginia Capes late in April, she remained in Newport preparing for a Pacific deployment until late May. On 5 June, Basilone got underway in company with , , and . She transited the Panama Canal on the 10th and, after stops at Oahu and Guam, arrived at Subic Bay on Independence Day ready to begin duty with the 7th Fleet. The destroyer entered Vietnamese waters on 7 July and commenced a 16-day tour plane-guarding . On 23 July, she parted company with the Oriskany task group and closed the coast of Vietnam near the DMZ with a gunfire support unit, Task Unit 70.8.2 (TU 70.8.2), to deliver call-fire bombardment to assist the troops ashore. She completed her part in that mission on 29 July and moved off to conduct special operations in the Gulf of Tonkin with and . Three days later, Basilone joined England (DLG-22) on the northern search and rescue (SAR) station where she served until 8 August. On 10 August, after two days service with on Tartar Station, Basilone cleared the Vietnam War zone for the Philippines. Not long after her arrival in Subic Bay, the destroyer received orders to duty with the Middle East Force. On 16 August, she departed Subic Bay in company with Trippe and the two warships made their way, via Singapore and Sri Lanka, to Manama, Bahrain, where they became units of the Middle East Force. For almost three months, she made goodwill visits to Middle Eastern ports, visiting Jidda, Saudi Arabia; Massawa and Asmara, Ethiopia; Karachi, Pakistan; Djibouti in the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas; and Mombasa, Kenya. At Mombasa, Basilone turned over her duties to her relief, , early in November and embarked on the long voyage back to the east coast of North America. Along the way, she called at Louren√ßo Marques, Mozambique; Luanda, Angola; Dakar, Senegal; and at Bermuda before arriving back at Newport on 2 December. The warship remained in port at Newport through the end of the year and through the first month of 1973, resuming local activity early in February. On the afternoon of 5 February 1973, while she conducted underway training and a burial at sea off the Virginia Capes, a boiler explosion killed seven of Basilones crew. The destroyer returned to Newport until 20 March at which time she was towed to the Boston Naval Shipyard. After nearly four months of repairs, Basilone arrived back at Newport on 30 July. On 8 August, she conducted ASW exercises with . Following refresher training at Guantanamo Bay, the warship put in at Newport for two weeks before changing her homeport to Norfolk on 1 October. In late November and early December, she participated in an Atlantic Fleet readiness exercise. 1974‚Äì1977 On 4 January 1974, Basilone stood out of Norfolk, commencing a six-month Mediterranean deployment. After changing operational control to 6th Fleet, the warship joined TF 60 on the 21st for ASW and electronic warfare exercises. The destroyer spent the better part of the two months between 3 February and 3 April at the Hellenic Shipyards, Skaramangas, Greece, repairing weak spots in her hull. Basilone visited Palma for two weeks in mid-April before taking part in two weeks of NATO exercises. After returning to Norfolk on 3 July, she enjoyed four months of leave, upkeep, and tender availability. Basilone got underway for task group operations on 2 November, but an engineering problem forced her into Mayport for repairs. On 19 December, she returned to Norfolk and commenced a three- month tender availability alongside in early 1975. After completing sea trials on 15 April 1975, Basilone participated in a 2nd Fleet exercise during the latter half of the month. Following a month of preparation, the warship commenced a 10-day transit to the Mediterranean on 12 June. The destroyer joined for carrier operations and helped search for five airmen downed in a collision between two Navy aircraft. Rest and replenishment at Sicily and Naples occupied her time in July. After a week-long NATO exercise in August, and brief operations in the eastern Mediterranean early in September, she took part in 6th Fleet exercises during late September and early October. November brought with it a visit to Toulon, France, followed by an exercise with French naval units. After completing her part in a 6th Fleet amphibious exercise, Basilone visited Barcelona from 4 to 9 December before heading for turnover at Rota. She stopped at Rota from the 10th to the 12th and then embarked on the voyage back to Norfolk, where she arrived on the 22nd. Following four weeks of rest and replenishment, the destroyer conducted type training with off the Virginia Capes during the latter half of January 1976. After a tender availability during the month of February, Basilone conducted type training with early in March and later operated with the carrier off Jacksonville, Florida, during the latter half of the month. The warship returned to Norfolk for upkeep and inspections during April and May. In June, training operations occupied her until generator repairs forced the ship to put in at Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, on the 20th. Basilone made goodwill visits to Miami, Florida and Eastport, Maine, before resuming training operations on 6 July. She made minor repairs at Mayport then returned to Norfolk on the 23rd for upkeep, replenishment, and repair that lasted until 4 November. On the 15th, the warship commenced eight days of exercises. On the 29th, the destroyer received new sonar equipment before entering drydock at the Bethlehem Steel Shipyard for nearly three weeks of repairs on 2 December. Upon returning to Norfolk, Basilone readied herself for her last Mediterranean deployment. Following her departure from Norfolk on 15 January 1977, the destroyer paused at Rota for turnover formalities before sailing on to Naples. She reached Naples on 4 February, loaded intelligence gear, embarked communication technicians and then sailed to Skaramangas Shipyard near Athens for repairs to her port shaft. Upon completion of three weeks of repair on 7 March, Basilone visited Turkey before participating in 6th Fleet and NATO operations during the latter half of March and the first week of April.

She was convicted of possessing explosives and intending to commit a terrorist act in the 9 November 2005 Amman bombings in Jordan that killed 60 people and injured 115 others, having survived when her explosive belt failed to detonate. Al-Qaida in Iraq claimed responsibility for the triple bombings that simultaneously hit three nearby hotels, and said they carried out the attack because the hotels were \\"a secure place for the filthy Israeli and Western tourists to spread corruption and adultery at the expense and suffering of the Muslims in these countries.\\" Background and Amman bombings Al-Rishawi and her husband Ali Hussein Ali al-Shamari are thought to have been Iraqi citizens and had Iraqi accents. According to her confession they traveled into Jordan about five days before the bombings on forged passports. She, along with her husband, entered the Amman Radisson Hotel ballroom during a wedding. When she had trouble detonating her suicide belt her husband pushed her out of the room before detonating a bomb that killed 38 people. Court proceedings Al-Rishawi was later captured by Jordanian authorities and confessed on national television. She was shown making a filmed confession with an apparent suicide bomb device around her and a detonator in hand showing that the device failed to explode, but later retracted her confession. She was convicted of possessing explosives and intending to commit a terrorist attack, and sentenced to death by hanging by a Jordanian military court on 21 September 2006. She appealed this conviction but her appeal was dismissed in January 2007. At the time of her execution, she was still engaged in the process of appeal of her sentence. ISIL Al- Rishawi was reportedly the sister of a former close aide of deceased al-Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, named by some reports as Mubarak Atrous al-Rishawi, who was killed by US forces in Iraq. On 24 January 2015, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) offered to trade Japanese journalist Kenji Goto and spare Royal Jordanian Air Force Lieutenant Muath al- Kasasbeh for Sajida al-Rishawi. Jordan put forward the option of exchanging al-Rishawi for al-Kasasbeh. The proposed exchange did not go further because ISIL failed to give plausible proof of life for al-Kasasbeh; Goto was beheaded in late January 2015 and ISIL released video footage in early February 2015 of al-Kasasbeh being burned alive, although Jordanian intelligence officials reported his killing took place in early January 2015.

The galaxy is formally classified as a Sm galaxy, which means that its structure vaguely resembles the structure of spiral galaxies. The galaxy is sometimes referred to as a Magellanic spiral because of its resemblance to the Magellanic clouds. Structure Unlike most spiral galaxies, NGC 4625 has a single spiral arm, which gives the galaxy an asymmetric appearance. It has been hypothesized that this galaxy's asymmetric structure may be the result of a gravitational interaction with NGC 4618. Such asymmetric structure is commonly seen among many interacting galaxies. However, observations of neutral hydrogen gas in NGC 4618 and NGC 4625 show that NGC 4625 does not appear to have been affected by the gravitational interaction. This indicates that the single-arm structure seen in NGC 4625 may be created through intrinsic processes. Ultraviolet observations of NGC 4625 made by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) show the presence of an extended disk. The new spiral disk extrends 28,000 light-years from the galaxy center, a staggering four times the optical radius. The hot blue stars in this new disk may have formed from the inflow of fresh gas and dust from interaction with its companions, NGC 4618 and NGC 4625A. The UV-to-optical colors suggest that the bulk of the stars in the disk of NGC 4625 are currently being formed, providing a unique opportunity to study today the physics of star formation under conditions similar to those when the normal disks of spiral galaxies like the Milky Way first formed.

It closed in December 2009 and was demolished in 2010 to be replaced with a new station, Wien Hauptbahnhof. It was located in Favoriten, in the south-east of the city. The East-bound rail services of S√ºdbahnhof remain in operation throughout the reconstruction via provisional train station \\"S√ºdbahnhof (Ostbahn)\\". History Predecessors The earliest antecedents of the modern S√ºdbahnhof were the Gloggnitzer Bahnhof, the start of the South railway, and the Raaber Bahnhof, the start of the East railway, which were built by Matthias Sch√∂nerer in a classical style (1841‚Äì1846). The two stations were placed symmetrically, and both made use of the same depots and workyards. Divided eastward and southward section In the course of industrialisation, the need for rail transportation grew, and the Austrian railways passed from private hands into government control. The old Raaber Bahnhof was replaced between 1867 and 1870 by the Centralbahnhof (\\"central station\\"), designed by A. Schumann, then in 1910 by the Staatsbahnhof (\\"State station\\") and in 1914, the Ostbahnhof (\\"eastern station\\"). The Gloggnitzer Bahnhof was also re-built to a design by Wilhelm von Flattich in 1874 (too late for the Weltausstellung), when it was renamed S√ºd-Bahnhof. Two railway lines were planned, extending from Vienna to the south and east: one to Wiener Neustadt and Gloggnitz, and one via Bruck an der Leitha to Gy≈ër (German: Raab), with an extension to Uj-Sz√∂ny (now a suburb of Kom√°rom) and a branch line to Pozsony (German: Pre√üburg, now Bratislava). This last branch line was, however, never realised. Initially, the Hungarian lines carried more freight, and were thought to be the more valuable, with plans being proposed to extend the line to Croatia and the Austro-Hungarian port of Trieste. The route to Gloggnitz was stifled by competition from the canal between Vienna and Wiener Neustadt, but benefited from passenger transport to tourist destinations such as M√∂dling, Gumpoldskirchen, Baden and Bad V√∂slau, making it the first Austrian railway to target passenger traffic directly. According to Matthias Sch√∂nerer, who was involved in every major Austrian railway project at the time, rather than a single station, it would be most sensible to build two termini at an obtuse angle to each other. The locomotive factory and other works were to be placed in the space between the two. Vienna S√ºdbahnhof, c. 1875 To the platforms The passenger station was built in a classical style, as was usual for public buildings around 1840. The entrance and exit were through the front of the building, which faced the location of the modern Schweizergarten, the station being considerably closer to S√ºdtiroler Platz then than it is now. The entrance hall was connected to the concourse on the first floor (AmE: second floor) by a staircase. The concourse was the first in Austria, comprised four platforms, large bow windows and was covered by a sturdy 23-metre wide construction of wooden beams held together by iron bands. A house between the two stations served as a restaurant, and was the only building to survive the re-building works on the following 110 years, although the two stations later received separate culinary facilities. During the boom of the Gr√ºnderzeit, a new and larger S√ºdbahnhof was planned by Wilhelm von Flattich, and building was completed in 1874. Including the peripheral wings, the new station was about three times wider than the old one, and the hall was broadened to 35.7 metres (the second largest in Vienna), which was enough for five (later six) platforms. Further platforms for local trains were built to the south of the main hall. The S√ºdbahnhof remained largely unchanged from 1874 to 1945. It served the lines south to Ljubljana, Trieste, Maribor, Carinthia, East Tyrol, South Tyrol and Zagreb. Until 1914, the CIWL express from St. Petersburg to Cannes stopped there; a remnant of this line, the Vienna-Cannes express continued to travel to and from the S√ºdbahnhof until 1939. As far back as the time of the Gloggnitzer Bahn, the railway southwards from Vienna was the busiest in the area. It was nationalised in 1924, although the properties remained in the hands of the Donau-Save-Adria-Eisenbahn AG until Anschlu√ü in 1938. In contrast to other Viennese stations, the S√ºdbahnhof was relatively undamaged by the Second World War; a small number of bombs fell on it, and a great deal of glass was broken in the fighting in April 1945. The steel framework was largely undamaged and services were soon restarted, although it became clear that renovation works would be necessary. The modern building Interior view of Vienna S√ºdbahnhof S-Bahn train (left), a EuroCity train (centre) and a regional train (right) Following the war, no reason could be found not to unite the two earlier railway stations into a single building. In particular, both railways had come into the ownership of the same company, the √ñBB (Austrian federal railways). The modern S√ºdbahnhof was built between 1955 and 1961 to plans by Heinrich Hrdlicka, in which the twin stations were united in a single building. Two underground platforms serve the S-Bahn network (lines S1, S2 and S3). At about the same time, the line between Vienna and Gloggnitz was electrified. During the re-building, the S√ºdbahnhof was extended towards the Schweizergarten, while the constituent parts of the old main hall were numbered and taken away to be used at a depot in Floridsdorf. The interior of the S√ºdbahnhof comprised a large hall with small shops and ticket counters around the edges. Platforms 11‚Äì18 (equivalent to the old Ostbahn) were one level higher, and platforms 1‚Äì9 (equivalent to the old S√ºdbahn) were two levels above the main hall. The front of the S√ºdbahnhof was served by tram lines O and 18. The side entrance on Schweizergartenstra√üe was served by tram line D and bus 13A. The nearest access to the U-Bahn network was a few hundred metres to the [east] west, at S√ºdtiroler Platz.  Closing and the future  The railway station was closed down December 13, 2009 and the building was torn down in 2010 to be replaced with housing and commercial estate.In Brief Railway Age February 2010 page 5 A new main railway station, Wien Hauptbahnhof, was constructed with the main entrance moved further East to S√ºdtiroler Platz to facilitate interconnection with public transport. The new station opened partially on 9 December 2012 and was fully operational in 2015.

History A 19th-century illustration of the Mus√©e des Augustins de Toulouse The building in which the museum is sited was built in 1309 in the Gothic style and prior to the French Revolution housed Toulouse's Augustinian convent. The convent was secularized in 1793 and first opened to the public as a museum on 27 August 1795 by decree of the French Convention, very shortly after the opening of the Louvre, making it one of the oldest museums in France after the Louvre and the Mus√©e des Beaux Arts in Besan√ßon.la Haute-Garonne encyclop√©die illustr√©e, page 292, It at first housed the Mus√©um Provisoire du Midi de la R√©publique and the √©cole des Beaux- Arts. The Mus√©e des Augustins de Toulouse was one of fifteen museums founded in provincial centres, by a decree of 13 Fructidor year IX (31 August 1801), which was promulgated by the minister of the interior, Jean-Antoine Chaptal (Arr√™t√© Chaptal du 14 fructidor an IX). At the start of the 19th century several medieval buildings (notably the refectory) were demolished and in their place Viollet-le-Duc and his pupil Darcy put up new exhibition galleries, accessed by a Gothic Revival monumental stair offering an interplay of richly complicated vaulting systems. The works continued from 1873 to 1901, when the museum reopened. In effect, Toulouse commissioned Urbain Vitry to ensure remove all the convent's religious characteristics. The archaeologist Alexandre Du M√®ge occupied the cloister and rebuilt it to be able to house the medieval collections gathered from Toulouse's destroyed religious buildings such as the basilique Saint-Sernin. Today the cloister houses a reconstructed medieval garden. The building was classed as a Monument historique in 1840.Notice number PA00094510, sur la base M√©rim√©e, minist√®re de la Culture Collections Paul Claudel aged sixteen by Camille Claudel, modeled in 1884 and cast in 1893 The progressive concern of the museum's founder Jean-Antoine Chaptal, an early example of cultural devolution, was intended to ensure that \\"each collection presents an interesting series of paintings representing all the masters, all the genres and all the schools\\". In a series of shipments culminating in 1811, Toulouse was enriched with works by Guercino, Pietro Perugino, Rubens and Philippe de Champaigne. The collections total over 4,000 works and their core derives from confiscation of Church property at the time of the French Revolution as well as seizures of the private collections of emigr√©s, in Toulouse notably the paintings of the cardinal de Bernis and Louis-Auguste le Tonnelier, baron de Breteuil.

It is particularly strong in 12th-century Romanesque sculpture from the city's three main religious buildings - the priory of Notre-Dame de la Daurade, the basilica of Saint-Sernin and the cathedral of Saint-√âtienne. Jorge Pardo realizes the new presentation of Romanesque sculpture. It also includes many 14th and 15th century locally produced sculptures and eight 16th century terracotta figures from the chapelle de Rieux (Notre-Dame de Grasse and works by the master of Rieux), built around 1340 in the couvent des Cordeliers, as well as gargoyles from the same convent. It also houses 19th century sculpture, with plaster works by Alexandre Falgui√®re and his pupil Antonin Merci√©, as well as works by Rodin and a bronze by Camille Claudel.

Specifically the reaction entails the condensation of guaiacol and glyoxylic acid in an ice cold, aqueous solution with sodium hydroxide. Biological elimination VMA is found in the urine, along with other catecholamine metabolites, including homovanillic acid (HVA), metanephrine, and normetanephrine. In timed urine tests the quantity excreted (usually per 24 hours) is assessed along with creatinine clearance, and the quantity of cortisols, catecholamines, and metanephrines excreted is also measured.

These urinalysis tests are used to diagnose an adrenal gland tumor called pheochromocytoma, a tumor of catecholamine-secreting chromaffin cells. These tests may also be used to diagnose neuroblastomas, and to monitor treatment of these conditions. Norepinephrine is metabolised into normetanephrine and VMA.

Milagros (also known as an ex-voto or dijes or promesas) are religious folk charms that are traditionally used for healing purposes and as votive offerings in Mexico, the southern United States, other areas of Latin America, and parts of the Iberian peninsula. They are frequently attached to altars, shrines, and sacred objects found in places of worship, and they are often purchased in churches and cathedrals, or from street vendors. Milagros come in a variety of shapes and dimensions and are fabricated from many different materials, depending on local customs. For example, they might be nearly flat or fully three-dimensional; and they can be constructed from gold, silver, tin, lead, wood, bone, or wax. In Spanish, the word milagro literally means miracle or surprise. History The use of milagros is a folk custom in parts of North, Central, and South America traceable to ancient Iberians who inhabited the coastal regions of Spain. The use of milagros accompanied the Spanish as they arrived in Central and South America. Although the custom is not as prevalent as it once was, the use of milagros or ex-votos continues to be a part of folk culture throughout rural areas of Spain‚Äîparticularly Andalusia, Catalonia, and Majorca. The text that is painted beneath this ex- voto tells of the Gonzalez family, who were on the streets a little late one night and were attacked. But, thanks to the Virgin of San Juan de los Lagos (whose image floats between the family and their assailants), they escaped unharmed. Our Lady of San Juan de los Lagos is venerated in the region of central Mexico where this dramatically-depicted incident occurred. The ex-voto is dated August 28, 1947, San Juan de los Lagos. As part of a religious ritual or an act of devotion, milagros can be offered to a symbol of a saint as a reminder of a petitioner's particular need, or in gratitude for a prayer answered. They are used to assist in focusing attention towards a specific ailment, based on the type of charm used. Milagro symbolism is not universal; a milagro of a body part, such as a leg, might be used as part of a prayer or vow for the improvement of a leg; or it might refer to a concept such as travel. Similarly, a heart might represent ideas as diverse as a heart condition, a romance, or any number of other interpretations. Milagros are also carried for protection and good luck. In addition to religious and ritual applications, milagros are often found as components in necklaces, earrings and other jewellery. They correspond almost exactly to the tamata used in the Eastern Orthodox Churches.

Shinty, and its close Irish relative hurling as well as the English bandy, are recognised as being the progenitors of ice hockey and are an important part of North America's modern sporting heritage. Despite this tradition, shinty itself went unplayed for almost 100 years at any serious level until the mid-1980s when Scottish Americans once again took an interest in the sport, with the first club being established in northern California. Since 2000, a concerted initiative, with support from the Camanachd Association in Scotland, has seen a revival of the sport. There is now a US Camanachd Association and Cup and clubs are also making the trip to Scotland to play tours. The Camanachd Cup itself made the long trip to New York City for the Tartan Day celebrations. Steps are afoot to open franchises in Oregon, Utah, Alabama, Louisiana and Arizona. The Oregon Franchise opened in 2010. The first ever All-American competition was held in September 2010 with Northern California, Washington and Oregon meeting at the Kelso Highlander Festival. It is a significant step for the sport of shinty to spread to new markets such as the United States and Canada which have large Scottish Gaelic communities. The first international games with a Scottish club on US soil were played in September 2009 against Skye Camanachd. US Camanachd Association US Camanachd operates as a body for fostering and assisting the spread of shinty within North America. It is operated by Northern California Camanachd. It is not the governing body of the sport in the US and Canada as it does not prescribe rules or govern competitions, instead recommending the rules of the Camanachd Association as used in Scotland. International Side US Camanachd co-ordinates the international representative team for the United States. The United States played England in the first ever shinty international between in May 2013. England won the fixture 2‚Äì0 on neutral ground in St. Andrew's. Clubs Northern California Camanachd Club Northern California Camanachd Club AKA NCCC is a shinty team based in the San Francisco Bay Area. It was the first shinty club of the modern era in North America being founded in 2001 and has been instrumental in the spread of the sport across the United States. Set up by Americans with Scottish heritage, including Michael Bentley, who trained with Skye Camanachd in 1983, Elheran Francis and Karl Davis. The NCCC officially came into being in 2001 as a means of fostering and developing an authentic Scottish sporting activity in northern California. They contested the first US Shinty cup, the Glenfarclas Cup, in 2004 with San Luis Obispo Shinty Club and played against their (now-defunct) state rivals several times. The NCCC hosts the Campbell Quaich (see Quaich). In 2005, the club made its first tour of Scotland, playing Tayforth Camanachd, Edinburgh East Lothian and Aberdour Shinty Club. They repeated this trip in 2006. Whilst also being the founders of US Camanachd, the club's players have also spread the game as ambassadors to other parts of the United States and there are, as of December 2010, 4 other clubs in the USA. The Northern California Camanachd Club also has Regional Challenge matches during the off Highland Games season, both clubs train year round. On 4 September 2005 the first international Shinty match between a team from USA and a team from Scotland on Scottish soil was played. The event was hosted by the Blairgowrie Highland Games where the Northern California Camanachd Club (NCCC) played a series matches against Tayforth. The Cup for the match series was provided by the Pleasanton Blairgowrie Fergus Sister City Organization and the \\"Player of the Match\\" award was provided by the Campbell Highland Games Association. The hosts Tayforth took home the cup, which they retained in 2006. Northern California Camanachd Club also participated in the first Annual Edinburgh East Lothian Levenhall Six a Side Shinty Tournament in Musselburgh on 5 September 2005, other teams were Edinburgh East Lothian, Aberdour Shinty Club and Edinburgh University Women's team. Edinburgh East Lothian won the tournament with NCCC coming in 3rd out of 4 teams. In June 2006 Gary Innes, Captain of Fort William Shinty Club and Man of the Match for the 2005 Camanachd Cup visited to California to play Shinty and to teach at a workshop hosted by the Northern California Camanachd Club open to all US Shinty Clubs. Gary Innes will be returning in June 2007 to teach another workshop open to all clubs and individuals. This workshop will help developing clubs as well as beginning level players. The club played its first twelve a-side fixture in Scotland against Skye Camanachd on 6 September 2007, they were defeated 9‚Äì0. The spring of 2008 marked the inaugural season of the Northern California Camanachd League Fixtures. The club was divided into three geographical regions: South Bay AKA Bayside Bears, North Bay AKA North Bay Rovers, and San Mateo AKA San Mateo Hooligans. Each team played each other twice in a six-game season. The club also brought shinty to the Pleasanton Highland Games in 2008. In 2009, they returned to Pleasanton, where they also hosted Skye Camanachd in the first ever international match on US soil. In September 2010 Northern California Camanachd traveled north to play Washington Camanachd and the Oregon Shinty Club at the Kelso Highlander Festival in Kelso, Washington. This is the first time that three US shinty clubs have met and played one another, and most likely the first time in history that three non-Scottish shinty clubs have ever met. NCC won 5‚Äì1 against Oregon and 3‚Äì0 against Washington. Further US shinty tournaments are being planned. The MacRae Shield The MacRae Shield is the trophy awarded to the Winner of the Norcal League. It was first presented in 2010 and was inscribed with the names of the three previous winners. It is named after John MacRae, former Skye Camanachd player, who donated the presentation camans upon it. Central California Camanachd Formerly the Washington Camanachd franchise, this has been in existence for over four years, playing against the Northern California Camanachd club and was represented on the US International side that traveled to Scotland to compete in the 2014 St Andrews Sixes Tournament. Oregon Camanachd As of 2010, a shinty franchise has started in Portland, Oregon. Oregon competed against NCCC and Washington at the Kelso Highland Games in September 2010. New England Camanachd A new club to begin in 2011, this franchise was started by an ex-Washington player who moved to Boston, this is now the second active club on the East Coast after the North Carolina Clubs. Defunct Clubs Morro Bay Shinty Club Morro Bay Shinty Club was the second shinty club in the modern era of shinty in North America. The club was founded as San Luis Obispo Shinty Club in 2004, adopting the wider scope of Morro Bay to increase the club's catchment area in 2006. The club founded the Glenfarclas Cup, the first intra-club US based Shinty cup, played at present between Morro Bay and Northern California Camanachd Club in 2004 and 2005. The Cup is sponsored by Glenfarclas, who also sponsor Morro Bay. The club planned to tour Scotland in 2007 but as of 4 April 2007 the club is no longer active, please contact the Northern California Camanachd Club for information on shinty in Central or Southern California. North Carolina Shinty Association The North Carolina Shinty Association (NCSA) became the newest East Coast shinty group in the fall of 2010. The group mission is to expand knowledge/interest in the game of shinty into all of North Carolina and provide shinty competition to the citizens of this state. The NCSA 2011 season is starting in March. Two clubs are currently playing in the Premier league, the Fuquay Varina Tigers and the Erwin Wolves. Clubs of the NCSA Fuquay Varina Camananachd Club The Fuquay-Varina Camanachd Club (FVCC) was formed in September 2010 and was located in the southern part of Wake County, North Carolina in the shadow of Raleigh. The club was founded by Timothy Rogers, an American with Scottish roots. The team is a part of the North Carolina Shinty Association. Its mascot was a tiger and its colors were orange/black. Erwin Shinty Club The Erwin Shinty Club (ESC) was formed in October 2010 and was located in the eastern part of Harnett County. The club was founded by Daniel Abbey, an American with English roots. The team was a part of the North Carolina Shinty Association. Its mascot was a wolf and its colors were red, black and white. The Erwin Shinty Club was an offshoot club from the FVCC formed to create true shinty competition in North Carolina. The teams shared a practice field. Awards of the NCSA Houston Camanachd Houston Camanachd Club was the third shinty team to be established in North America in the Modern Era in 2005. The club was founded by Warren Clifford, a shinty player from the NCCC. The developmental aim of the club was to compete against the other shinty teams in North America. However, their extreme distance from any other club, the rest of the clubs being on the Western Seaboard, meant that Houston did not develop into a fully blown club and as of 2010 can be considered to be inactive. Dunedin Camanachd Dunedin Camanachd was founded in the Spring of 2006 by an Ex-Pat Scot, being the First East Coast club in a century. Located in Dunedin, Florida, Dunedin Camanachd drew their co-ed player base throughout the Tampa Bay area. The club was affiliated to Lewis Camanachd in Scotland and received a donation of equipment from the fledgling club. The management relocated to Washington State which led to Dunedin folding.

His name is a Welsh form of Solomon, appearing in the oldest genealogies as Selim. He reputedly bore the nickname Sarffgadau, meaning battle-serpent. According to the Annals of Ulster and the Annals of Wales, in 616 he died at the Battle of Chester, fighting against √Üthelfrith of Northumbria. The Annals of Ulster entitle him King of the Britons, perhaps because he led a combined force from more than one Brythonic kingdom at that battle against the Northumbrians. In Jesus College MS 18, Selyf is identified as father of Beli and subsequently ancestor of the later kings of Powys; in other genealogies, he is father of an Eiludd ap Selyf, and in another, he is identified as grandfather of a Beli ap Mael Myngan ap Selyf. Breneu Powys, or the Privileges of Powys, by Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr, the court poet of the major Kingdoms of Wales at the time, refers to Selyf's descendants as serpents of battle, most likely in reference to the Mathrafal dynasty, which ruled Powys at the time. This suggests that Eiludd, who is most commonly identified as progenitor of the continuation of the House of Gwerthrynion, was likely to have been a son of Selyf.

It aims to help nurture a new generation of youths with interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) to aspire in improving the lives of people, and encourages students to develop problem solving skills, entrepreneurial skills, creative thinking skills and team spirit.  History  National Robotics Competition was first organised in 1999 as National Junior Robotics Competition (NJRC) with 167 teams from 70 schools. In the competition, teams of not more than 5 students build a robot using the Lego Mindstorms robotics system. Competitors are divided into three categories: Upper Primary Division, for Primary 3 to Primary 6 students, Secondary Division for secondary or equivalent level, and Tertiary Division, for 1st and 2nd year ITE/JC/Poly students. In 2007, 13 schools participated in the competition, sending a total of 37 teams. In 2016, a holistic review is made to the competition following an announcement during the closing ceremony of the competition that year. NJRC was officially renamed as National Robotics Competition (NRC) in 2017. An additional category for children aged six to eight years is added, along with other new elements such as the robotic arm hackathon.  National Junior Robotics Competition Milestones  2015 * Raffles Institution won the championship in the Tertiary category for the first time, also winning the Best Programming Award (1st), Best Research Award (1st), Best Presentation (2nd) and Best Journal (2nd). 2013 * Mission for primary school requires the use of colour sensor. * Missions are similar to challenges in WRO 2013 * Surprise mission in primary school preliminaries day 1 needs two colour sensors; one for detecting colour of cubes, one for detecting colour of bins (which was decided through throwing of dice) * Nan Hua Primary School won the championship in the Primary School category for the first time. * ITE College Central won the championship in the Tertiary category for the first time. 2008 * The first mission of the challenge involves knocking down drink cans of 330ml each. * The mission also involves a second mission which is a secret mission. They are made known to the Pri and Sec Sch teams a few days before the actual challenge. The tertiary teams only know the secret mission on the actual day of the challenge. * 10th anniversary of National Junior Robotics Competition * Hwa Chong Institution won the National Junior Robotics Competition Championship for 2 years consecutively in the Tertiary Division, and also clinched the Best Robot Performance Award in the Tertiary Division. * River Valley High won the championship for secondary division for the first time. * Rulang Primary School reclaimed their status as the robotics champion for upper primary division from Chua Chu Kang Primary School, which won the championship for 2006 and 2007. 2007 * The introduction of the Lego Mindstorms NXT system * The mission had two storeys * The teams had to present a video footage to showcase the team's entire learning journey instead of the usual journal * The introduction of new category involving ITE/JC/Poly(1st year & 2nd year) students * For the first time in National Junior Robotics Competition's history, the judges allowed Admiralty Secondary School to have a rerun for the mission. This was because the playfield was not up to standard as structural errors were experienced. The playfield which Admiralty Secondary School ran on had its deformities, resulting in the playfield's base to be unbalanced. Thus, many of Admiralty Secondary School's robots were unable to complete the missions during the first run. It was after several deliberations and negotiations before the decision was announced to allow Admiralty Secondary School a second run for the mission so as to make sure the teams are playing under fair grounds. * Chua Chu Kang Primary School won the championship award for the upper primary category for 2 years consecutively, with full marks for the surprise mission during the Grand Finals. 2006 * Robots have to travel in 5 cm deep waters * The mission had an elevator * The playing field was constructed using acrylic * Admiralty Secondary School won the National Junior Robotics Competition Championship for 4 years consecutively. 2005 * The mission had three storeys * The mission had stairs * Admiralty Secondary School won the National Junior Robotics Competition Championship for 3 years consecutively. 2004 * Teams were given 7 missions to work on * Mobile phones were not allowed to be used by competitors during competition * Teams were not provided with the playing field to use at their own home ground. Only selected schools were provided * All teams in the Primary school section achieved zero points in the surprise mission * \\"The Best Robot Performance Award\\" was decided from the interview sessions. * Admiralty Secondary School won the National Junior Robotics Competition Championship for 2 years consecutively. 2003 * The mission features double level playfields 2002 * Non-competitors were not allowed in the pit areas to prevent unfair advantages * The playing mat was made out of printed paper and not black sticky tape * The \\"Surprise mission\\" was revealed on the Finals itself. 2001 * Teams were allowed to use two light sensors and one rotation sensor * The \\"Surprise mission\\" was introduced.

The letters make reference to points raised by intelligent design proponents. There are four separate letters: A Christian Clergy Letter, a Rabbi Letter, a Unitarian Universalist Clergy Letter and a Buddhist Clergy Letter. As of August 12, 2013, there were 12,878 signatures from Christian clergy, 503 signatures from Jewish rabbis, 273 signatures from Unitarian Universalist clergy and 23 signatures from Buddhist clergy. This effort was initiated in 2004 by the biologist Michael Zimmerman, now vice president for academic affairs and provost at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington. The letter was written by John McFadden, pastor of the First Congregational United Church of Christ in Appleton, Wisconsin. The project also encourages congregations to participate in Evolution Weekend by sponsoring events in which clergy and congregations are encouraged to learn about and discuss evolution. The weekend chosen is the closest Sunday to Charles Darwin's birthday, February 12. Evolution Sunday events first took place in 2006 and the project renamed it in 2008 to be more inclusive. The Clergy Letter Project states that Evolution Weekend activities are \\"an opportunity for serious discussion and reflection on the relationship between religion and science\\" and in an effort \\"to elevate the quality of the discussion on this critical topic, and to show that religion and science are not adversaries.\\" The project states that events are specifically intended to emphasize that \\"Religious people from many diverse faith traditions and locations around the world understand that evolution is quite simply sound science; and for them, it does not in any way threaten, demean, or diminish their faith in God. In fact, for many, the wonders of science often enhance and deepen their awe and gratitude towards God.\\" Statement The letters are entitled An Open Letter Concerning Religion and Science. The four letters have somewhat distinct texts. In addition to English, the Christian version of the project has also been translated to Spanish, Portuguese, and French. Rabbi Letter Unitarian Universalist Letter Buddhist Clergy Letter History The project was organized in 2004 by Michael Zimmerman, then a biology professor and dean of the College of Science and Letters at University of Wisconsin‚ÄìOshkosh. He was motivated to create a petition by the actions of the school board in Grantsburg, Wisconsin, which had passed some anti-evolution policies in the summer of 2004. Zimmerman was a veteran of similar disputes in Ohio, when he was a professor at Oberlin College. After Zimmerman watched Christian fundamentalist clergy from Dover, Pennsylvania, on the television program Nightline insisting that decisions about teaching evolution in schools was equivalent to a choice between heaven and hell, he recruited the husband of the head of the university Psychology Department, John McFadden, pastor of the First Congregational United Church of Christ in Appleton, Wisconsin, to write a letter describing how science and religion can co-exist. Zimmerman worked with local clergy in Wisconsin to get clergy to sign this letter, and within a few weeks he had collected almost 200 clergy signatures. The signed letter was delivered to the Grantsburg School Board on December 16, 2004. This effort, together with those of other concerned groups of educators, citizens and scientists, lead the Grantsburg School Board to rescind its policies. After this success, Zimmerman was encouraged to organize a nationwide campaign and gather more signatures. By September 12, 2005, the Clergy Letter Project had collected more than 7,500 signatures. By the beginning of December 2005, the project had amassed more than 10,000 signatures. Most of the clergy who signed are Protestant, an artifact of the way that people were originally invited to sign the letter. Email invitations were sent, and it was easier to get email addresses for some churches and denominations than others. The clergy letter was at first limited to Christian clergy, and Zimmerman declined offers from Jewish and Muslim clergy. Zimmerman stated that \\"Since it is fundamentalist Christian ministers who have been shouting to the American people that they must choose between religion and science, it seemed reasonable to have thousands upon thousands of Christian clergy assert otherwise. It simply wouldn't be very persuasive to have leaders of other religions saying to Christians that Christian fundamentalist ministers are not speaking for all Christians...the Clergy Letter Project and Evolution Sunday are not designed to change the minds of fundamentalists. Rather, our goal is to educate the vast majority of Christians who, if told they have to choose between religion and modern science, are likely to opt for religion.\\" Later, however, three additional statements were added to the project: a Jewish rabbi letter, a Unitarian Universalist clergy letter, and a Buddhist clergy letter. Evolution Weekend and related activities Zimmerman and the Clergy Letter Project also organize \\"Evolution Weekend,\\" an annual movement to encourages churches to discuss the role of science and religion in sermons, discussion groups, seminars, and other activities on the weekend nearest to February 12, the birthday of Charles Darwin (Darwin Day). The day began in 2006 as \\"Evolution Sunday,\\" gaining attention from The New York Times. In 2008, it was renamed \\"Evolution Weekend\\" to incorporate more faith traditions. In 2011, 652 congregations from all 50 states and the District of Columbia as well as 13 countries participated in Evolution Weekend activities. Zimmerman and the Clergy Letter Project maintain a list of 1,052 scientists from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and 32 countries, who have agreed to serve as \\"technical consultants to clergy members who have questions about the science associated with all aspects of evolution.\\" The project states that \\"The very existence of this list clearly demonstrates the willingness of scientists to work collaboratively with clergy members. Together, scientists and clergy members demonstrate that religion and science can have a complementary and positive relationship with one another.\\" Evolution Weekend often gained attention from several news outlets, with participating clergy being interviewed in local publications. Reaction from creationists The creationist Discovery Institute, which arranged its own anti-evolution petition called A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism in 2001 criticized the project. Discovery Institute communications director Rob Crowther asserted that the disputes about evolution was \\"purely a scientific debate\\" and that clergy petitions are irrelevant, stating that clergy \\"don't make any difference,\\" since \\"We don't think there is anything religious at all to the theory of intelligent design.\\" Zimmerman described this argument as part of the problem, as intelligent design tried to undermine science by changing it from a study of the natural world to include supernatural explanations, and it was important for clergy to defend science against these attacks. Ken Ham and Mark Looy of the creationist organization Answers in Genesis have repeatedly condemned Evolution Sunday/Evolution Weekend activities as a \\"Darwin praise service\\" and expressing dismay that \\"over 10,200 clergy had signed this awful letter.\\" Ham and Looy also criticized Zimmerman's fundraising efforts through the Christian Alliance for Progress. Answers in Genesis published a list of \\"modern scientists who have accepted the biblical account of creation.\\" The majority are not biologists. The group has also organized \\"Creation Sunday\\" in response to Evolution Weekend, and has promoted the Creation Letter Project in response to Clergy Letter Project. Jonathan Dudley, a divinity student at Yale University and author of the book Broken Words: The Abuse of Science and Faith in American Politics (2011), wrote approvingly of Evolution Sunday in the Yale Daily News on January 24, 2007, while still worrying that congregations were not being taught to think for themselves with this current campaign, any more than subscribing to fundamentalist Christian Biblical literalist doctrines. This caused Discovery Institute fellow Jonathon Wells to write a scathing article in the Yale Daily News about Evolution Sunday, \\"Darwinism,\\" and Zimmerman. Wells repeated creationist objections to evolution by claiming that there is no evidence of evolution and condemning evolution for not being in agreement with the views of 40% of the American public. Zimmerman responded to Wells' attack with a column in the Yale Daily News pointing out the copious errors of fact in Wells' article. Wells followed this with a letter to the editor in the Yale Daily News. Wells brushed over the points Zimmerman had raised, and focused on whether the word \\"Darwinism\\" is appropriate or not. Wells also responded with vigor to two others who had written letters to the editor critical of his original article. Finally, Wells claimed that the only reason to stage Evolution Sunday is because evolution is not \\"scientifically sound or religiously neutral,\\" and that it is \\"promoting an anti-religious philosophy disguised as empirical science.\\" University of Iowa faculty member Tara C. Smith noted several other responses to this episode in her blog, Aetiology.

It was first published by Ballantine Books in 1978. It was the fifth of Kurtz' Deryni novels to be published, and the second book in her second Deryni trilogy, The Legends of Camber of Culdi. The latter trilogy serves as prequels to The Chronicles of the Deryni series that Kurtz wrote from 1970 to 1973, and it details the events that occurred two centuries before the Chronicles trilogy. Plot introduction The novel is set in the land of Gwynedd, one of the fictional Eleven Kingdoms. Gwynedd itself is a medieval kingdom similar to the British Isles of the 10th century, with a powerful Holy Church (based on the Roman Catholic Church), and a feudal government ruled by a hereditary monarchy. The population of Gwynedd includes normal humans and Deryni, a race of people with inherent psychic and magical abilities. The novel begins six months after the conclusion of Camber of Culdi and is set around King Cinhil Haldane's efforts and those of his allies to secure the kingdom following the successful coup that overthrew the Deryni tyrant, King Imre Furst√°n-Festil. The former-priest-turned-king struggles with his conscience and his new responsibilities while Earl Camber MacRorie and his family engage in a dangerous and desperate plan to protect king and realm. Plot summary The novel spans a time period of one and a half years, from June 905 to January 907. It begins as the allies and supporters of King Cinhil Haldane prepare to meet the invasion of Princess Ariella Furst√°na-Festila, the sister and lover of the deposed King Imre Furst√°n-Festil. Although Imre died in the coup that placed Cinhil on the throne, Ariella escaped to the neighboring kingdom of Torenth, where she has sought refuge with her relatives. Having given birth to Imre's bastard son, she now seeks to return to Gwynedd and retake the throne. She has been using magic to influence the weather, hoping to flood the plains and rivers of Gwynedd to facilitate the invasion of her army. Cinhil's closest advisors are preparing to meet the invaders, but the king himself has become aloof and withdrawn since his ascension to the throne. He has become convinced that he sinned against God by giving up his priestly vows to become king, and he displays increasing hostility and antagonism toward Earl Camber MacRorie of Culdi, the Deryni adept most responsible for placing Cinhil on the throne. Throughout the preparations for battle and the march to the battlefield itself, Cinhil constantly clashes with the Deryni closest to him, lashing out angrily as his resentment toward Camber in particular and Deryni in general continues to grow. Although Cinhil seems to place slightly more trust in Alister Cullen, the Deryni Vicar General of the Michaelines, even Cullen is rebuffed when he makes overtures of friendship to the king. The Gwyneddan army meets Ariella's invaders on the plain of Iomaire, and the two forces clash the following day. Despite being outnumbered, Cinhil's army emerges victorious and wins the day. Following the battle, Camber and his son, Joram, discover the scene of Ariella's final stand. While attempting to flee the battle, Ariella had been confronted by Alister Cullen and the two fought a brutal battle that claimed both of their lives. Camber soon realizes that Cullen's death will only further alienate the king, as Cullen enjoyed more of Cinhil's trust than any other Deryni. Without Cullen to temper Cinhil's growing mistrust of Deryni, Camber fears that an anti-Deryni backlash might sweep through the kingdom. Camber then convinces Joram to help him switch shapes with the slain Cullen, believing that he can do more to help Cinhil and the kingdom as Alister Cullen than he can as Camber MacRorie. Joram initially resists the idea, but eventually concedes to his father's wishes. He helps Camber switch appearances with Cullen and then returns to the royal camp, bearing the body of a slain man bearing the appearance of Camber MacRorie. With the exceptions of Joram and Camber's son-in-law, Lord Rhys Thuryn, the rest of the world believes that Camber has died and Cullen has lived. As the army returns to Valoret, Camber does his best to act out the role of the new persona he has adopted. Although he managed to retrieve some of Cullen's memories, his inability to assimilate those memories in safety is beginning to affect his health. Shortly after returning to Valoret, Camber is able to begin the process of assimilating Cullen's memories with the assistance of Rhys, Joram, and his daughter Evaine, but the procedure is interrupted by Cinhil. Unable to stop the procedure, Camber's disguise briefly slips away and the king witnesses the momentary change. Shocked and confused, Cinhil orders that nobody speak of the incident and flees the room. Once in full possession of Cullen's remaining memories, Camber settles into his new identity with increased confidence. However, his former squire, Lord Guaire d'Arliss, remains despondent over Camber's supposed death. Taking pity on the man, Camber sheds his disguise and visits Guaire late one night, convincing him to cease his mourning. Guaire believes the visit is just a dream, but he takes heart from it and immediately asks to enter the service of the man he knows as Alister Cullen. Camber must next deal with a matter of conscience. Cullen was due to become Bishop of Grecotha before his death, but Camber knows that he will be breaking ecclesiastical law by pretending to be a priest. The night before Camber's consecration as a bishop, Joram convinces him to legitimize his status and be ordained as a priest. Camber reveals the truth of his identity to his old friend Archbishop Anscom, and Anscom agrees to perform the ceremony. The following morning, the newly ordained Camber is consecrated as Bishop of Grecotha. Camber spends much of the next year in Grecotha and Valoret. The friendship that Cullen offered Cinhil is finally accepted, and the king and the bishop become very close. Believing he is finally free of Camber's influence, Cinhil finally seems to resolve his inner conflict and soon begins to evolve into an independent king. The potential that Camber observed in Cinhil before the Restoration is finally realized, and Cinhil starts to take an active role in governing the realm. Camber's desperate gamble appears to have paid off, as Cinhil shows more and more signs of becoming the true king of the realm. However, much to the surprise of Camber and his family, Camber's supposed death has resulted in more of a public impact than they ever expected. Grateful to Camber for his central role in the Restoration, some people have begun to venerate his memory, with some going so far as to form small cults dedicated to the belief that Camber had been a saint. Fully aware of the depth of their deception, Camber and his kin are horrified by these developments. Nonetheless, they cannot risk discovery of the truth by opposing such beliefs too vehemently or publicly. In an effort to ensure that their secret remains hidden, Joram and Rhys move Cullen's body out of Camber's tomb in August 906. Archbishop Anscom assures Camber that he will not allow any efforts to canonize Camber succeed, but Anscom died in September. The following month, Anscom's successor, Archbishop Jaffray, receives a formal request to canonize Camber MacRorie. During the ecclesiastical court that follows, Camber and his family are forced to remain silent, unwilling to reveal the truth that Camber is actually sitting in the very room where the court is determining his sanctity. Guaire relates the tale of Camber's visit, but he now believes that the event was actually a miracle. When Camber's tomb is revealed to be empty, Joram attempts to provide a legitimate excuse. However, his efforts to end the court are unsuccessful, and his father's empty tomb is also classified as a miracle. That night, Cinhil confesses to Camber that he has been secretly performing the rites of his former priestly vocation, even going so far as to celebrate Mass in private. Although stunned by this revelation, Camber realizes that Cinhil's illicit actions have served to soothe the king's tortured conscience, giving him a peace of mind that has enabled him to grow and develop as a ruler. Feeling that he has already inflicted too much misery upon Cinhil, Camber ultimately forgives Cinhil and promises to keep the king's secret. The following day, Cinhil is called as a witness before the ecclesiastical court. Although unwilling to get involved in the procedure, Cinhil reluctantly describes seeing Camber's face come over Bishop Cullen shortly after Camber's death. Unable to provide a logical explanation for the event, the court can only agree that Camber MacRorie somehow returned after death to help Alister Cullen. Believing it has evidence of three miracles, the court soon canonizes Camber MacRorie. Camber himself is helpless to stop the chain of events, and can only watch in silence. The novel ends shortly after the new year, as Cinhil and Camber examine a statue of \\"Saint Camber\\" that has been erected. As Cinhil leaves, he is still unaware that the man at his side is actually Camber MacRorie.

The city is traditionally divided into four main areas based on the cardinal points of a compass, each of which form the basis of constituencies for general elections: North Belfast, East Belfast, South Belfast, and West Belfast. These four areas meet at Belfast City Centre. The second traditional divide is that formed by the River Lagan, with the northern bank of the River being part of County Antrim, while the southern bank is part of County Down. The city's subdivisions reflect the divided nature of Northern Ireland as a whole, with areas tending to be highly segregated, especially in working-class neighbourhoods. Walls known as peace lines, originally erected by the British Army after August 1969, divide fourteen inner city neighbourhoods.  Townlands  The townlands of Belfast are the oldest surviving land divisions in the city. The city's townlands are split between the two traditional counties by the River Lagan, with those townlands north of the river generally in County Antrim, while those on the southern bank are generally part of County Down. Most of these townlands are older than the city itself, and most of their names are derived from the Irish language. As the city grew, these once-rural townlands were built upon and their boundaries became obscured. However, many of the city's streets, roads and housing estates have been named after them. Electoral wards Map showing location of District Electoral Areas prior to 2014 reorganisation: 1: Balmoral; 2: Castle; 3: Court; 4: Laganbank; 5: Lower Falls; 6: Oldpark; 7: Pottinger; 8: Upper Falls; 9: Victoria. Note The electoral wards of Belfast are subdivisions of the city, used primarily for statistics and elections. Belfast has had 51 wards since May 1973, which were revised in May 1985 and again in May 1993. Wards are the smallest administrative unit in Northern Ireland and are set by the Local Government Boundaries Commissioner and reviewed every 8‚Äì10 years. The wards were redrawn for the 2014 elections.Map from the District Electoral Areas Commissioner Maps page . See District Electoral Areas Commissioner page In elections to Belfast City Council, the 51 wards are split into nine District Electoral Areas (DEAs), each of which contains between five and seven wards, with the number of councillors it elects equal to the number of wards it contains. The current DEAs are: * Balmoral (6 wards) * Castle (6 wards) * Court (5 wards) * Laganbank (5 wards) * Lower Falls (5 wards) * Oldpark (6 wards) * Pottinger (6 wards) * Upper Falls (5 wards) * Ormiston (formerly Victoria) (7 wards) Constituencies Belfast's electoral wards are used to create constituencies for elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly and the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. These constituencies are coterminous and are created by amalgamating wards into larger areas, with the city's 51 wards split between the four 'Belfast' constituencies, each of which contains between 11 and 14 wards, although these also contain wards from bordering local authorities. These constituencies follow the tradition of referring to parts of Belfast by the four cardinal directions: ; Belfast East * Belfast East (Assembly) * Belfast East (parliamentary) ; Belfast North * Belfast North (Assembly) * Belfast North (parliamentary) ; Belfast South * Belfast South (Assembly) * Belfast South (parliamentary) ; Belfast West * Belfast West (Assembly) * Belfast West (parliamentary) Cultural quarters The Belfast Quarters refer to a number of distinctive cultural zones within the city of Belfast, whose identities have been developed as a spur to tourism and urban regeneration. These \\"quarters\\" differ from the districts into which Belfast is divided. The term \\"quarter\\" does not refer to one fourth (or one quarter) of the city, nor is every area in the centre of Belfast part of one of the quarters. Instead, each \\"quarter\\" reflects something about a neighbourhood's history and locale, with the \\"Quarter\\" label being something that has come into general use in recent years.It was first said at the Ireland-US Council and Ireland Fund's Winter Week Conference in Palm Beach, USA in February 2006 that Belfast was once a city of two-halves, but is now a city of seven- quarters. The quarters are as follows: *Cathedral Quarter *Gaeltacht Quarter *Linen Quarter *Market Quarter *Queen's Quarter *Smithfield and Union Quarter *Titanic Quarter *Library Quarter *Station Quarter (Planned)  Postcodes of Belfast  Belfast city centre is divided into two postcode districts, BT1 for the area lying north of the City Hall, and BT2 for the area to its south.

In the method a suspension of Agrobacterium tumefaciens is introduced into a plant leaf by direct injection or by vacuum infiltration, or brought into association with plant cells immobilised on a porous support (plant cell packs),|url=https://www.researchgate.net/project/Plant-cell-pack-aka-cookie- technology whereafter the bacteria transfer the desired gene into the plant cells via transfer of T-DNA. The main benefit of agroinfiltration when compared to the more traditional plant transformation is speed and convenience, although yields of the recombinant protein are generally also higher and more consistent. The first step is to introduce a gene of interest to a strain of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Subsequently, the strain is grown in a liquid culture and the resulting bacteria are washed and suspended into a suitable buffer solution. For injection, this solution is then placed in a syringe (without a needle). The tip of the syringe is pressed against the underside of a leaf while simultaneously applying gentle counterpressure to the other side of the leaf. The Agrobacterium suspension is then injected into the airspaces inside the leaf through stomata, or sometimes through a tiny incision made to the underside of the leaf. Vacuum infiltration is another way to introduce Agrobacterium deep into plant tissue. In this procedure, leaf disks, leaves, or whole plants are submerged in a beaker containing the solution, and the beaker is placed in a vacuum chamber. The vacuum is then applied, forcing air out of the intercellular spaces within the leaves via the stomata. When the vacuum is released, the pressure difference forces the \\"Agrobacterium\\" suspension into the leaves through the stomata into the mesophyll tissue. This can result in nearly all of the cells in any given leaf being in contact with the bacteria. Once inside the leaf the Agrobacterium remains in the intercellular space and transfers the gene of interest as part of the Ti plasmid-derived T-DNA in high copy numbers into the plant cells. The gene transfer occurs when the plant signals are induced and physical contact is made between the plant cells and bacterium. The bacteria creates a mechanism that burrows a hole and transfers the new T-DNA strand into the plant cell. The T-DNA moves into the nucleus of the plant and begins to integrate into the plants' chromosome. The gene is then transiently expressed through RNA synthesis from appropriate promoter sequences in all transfected cells (no selection for stable integration is performed). The plant can be monitored for a possible effect in the phenotype, subjected to experimental conditions or harvested and used for purification of the protein of interest. Many plant species can be processed using this method, but the most common ones are Nicotiana benthamiana and less often, Nicotiana tabacum. Transient expression in cultured plant cell packs is a new procedure, recently patented by the Fraunhofer Institute IVV, Germany. For this technique, suspension cultured cells of tobacco (e.g.: NT1 or BY2 cell lines of Nicotiana tabacum) are immobilised by filtration onto a porous support to form a well-aerated cell pack, then incubated with recombinant Agrobacterium for a time to allow T-DNA transfer, before refiltration to remove excess bacteria and liquid. Incubation of the cell pack in a humid environment for time periods up to several days allows transient expression of protein. Secreted proteins can be washed out of the cell pack by application of buffer and further filtration.  Silencing suppressors in agroinfiltration  Agroinfiltration using a promoter::GUS construct in Nicotiana benthamiana\\" with TBSV p19 (right leaf disc) and without TBSV p19 (left leaf disc). It's quite common to coinfiltrate the Agrobacterium carrying the construct of interest together with another Agrobacterium carrying a silencing suppressor protein gene such as the one encoding the p19 protein from the plant pathogenic Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV), or the NSs protein from tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV). TBSV was first discovered in 1935 in tomatoes and results in plants with stunted growth and deformed fruits. TSWV was discovered in tomatoes in Australia in 1915, and for many years was the only member of what is now known as genus Tospovirus, family Bunyaviridae. In order to defend itself against viruses and other pathogens that introduce foreign nucleic acids into their cells, plants have developed a system of post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) where small interfering RNAs are produced from double-stranded RNA in order to create a sequence specific degradation pathway that efficiently silence non-native genes. Many plant viruses have developed mechanisms that counter the plants PTGS-systems by evolving proteins, such as p19 and NSs, that interfere with the PTGS-pathway at different levels. Although it is not clear exactly how p19 works to suppress RNA silencing, studies have shown that transiently expressed proteins in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves have an up to 50-fold higher yield when coinfiltrated with TBSV p19. TSWV and other tospovirus NSs proteins have been shown to be effective as suppressors of both local and systemic silencing, and may be a useful alternative to p19 where the latter has been shown not to be effective. In other studies, p19 from artichoke mottled crinkle virus has been shown to have a similar, although weaker, effect to TBSV p19.

Sonic hedgehog (shh) signaling from the ZLI is crucial in the development of the diencephalon, which develops into the thalamus, the pretectum, and the anterior tegmental structures. The ZLI together with the prethalamus and thalamus make up the mid-diencephalic territory (MDT). rostral extension between the prethalamus and thalamus depicts the ZLI. Discovery Cell lineage restriction boundaries, across which replicating cells cannot migrate, were first discovered in invertebrates, where the expression of various Hox genes in each compartment confer the differentiation of observable segments in the adult body of Drosophila melanogaster. Analogous structures were discovered in the developing vertebrate brain. Rhombomeres, which extend down the embryo from the hindbrain, contain clear boundaries and each express various Hox genes that are necessary for differentiation of structures within the body. More anterior regions of the brain were examined in search of other cell lineage restriction boundaries, and multiple potential boundaries continue to be studied (see Developmental Boundaries). Layout of Hox genes in the fruitfly leading to differential development of segments The importance of these compartments as local signaling centers, areas which chemically influence surrounding tissue, was elucidated by first observing differential expression of Hox genes in various compartments and second by observing mutant D. melanogaster and corresponding phenotypic (physical) changes. The ZLI was first discovered in the chick using explant and lineage-labeling experiments. In the explant experiments, cells in the region that will become the ZLI, the prethalamus, and the thalamus in the chick were removed and placed into separate cultures; the cells continued to grow and retained their identity (the ZLI began transcribing, whereas the prethalamus and thalamus did not). Necessity of the ZLI and its corresponding ' expression were evidenced by lack of thalamic and prethalamic genetic markers in culture (see Signaling). These experiments confirmed the ZLI as a signaling center. In lineage-labeling experiments, cells were genetically marked, so that each time a labeled cell replicated, its progeny were marked as well. Cells that were marked in the developing ZLI and their progeny remained restricted to the zone. These experiments demonstrated the ZLI as a cell-lineage restriction boundary. Not only a boundary, the ZLI is also a compartment with separate cell lineage restriction boundaries both anterior and posterior of a section of shh expression. The importance of the ZLI was once more confirmed by ectopic expression of shh in other regions of the forebrain, known as the prosencephalon during development (both the telencephalon and diencephalon), inducing a ZLI-like region that induces thalamic fate. Developmental boundaries During development in both vertebrates and invertebrates, cell lineage restriction boundaries and signaling centers are formed in order to ensure proper differentiation of the body. Chemical signals, like shh from the ZLI, are often released from these boundaries and compartments in a concentration gradient (the chemicals are in much higher concentrations closer to the source) and confer identity to flanking regions. Other genes differentially expressed in these flanking regions aid in ensuring proper differentiation (see Signaling). Main structures of the developing brain: the prosencephalon (forebrain) consists of the telencephalon and diencephalon, the mesencephalon is the midbrain, and the rhombencephalon is the hindbrain. Many developmental boundaries have been studied: within the forebrain alone, the confirmed cell lineage restriction boundaries are the pallial-subpallial boundary (PSB) dividing the dorsal and ventral telencephalon, the diencephalon-midbrain boundary (DMB) posterior to the ZLI, and the ZLI. The ZLI, like each rhombomere, serves as an independent compartment that confers the identity of diencephalon in anterior and posterior regions. Other developmental boundaries serve as cell-lineage restriction boundaries but not signaling centers, while others are signaling centers to and from which cells can migrate. Despite discoveries of cell lineage restriction boundaries and compartments in the brain, many of the regions studied have been disproven as segmental boundaries. These areas have potential as signaling centers, which have influence over the development of neighboring tissues. These boundaries have great influence over other regions of the brain: the placement of the ZLI not only affects the size of adjacent regions but also the size of the telencephalon. A posterior shift in the ZLI allows more cells to be allocated to the telencephalon. The same is true for other developmental boundaries in the brain and throughout the body: shifts in boundaries responsible for allocating a certain amount of tissue to a certain function result in drastic changes in the adult structure. These boundaries are of crucial importance for proper differentiation. Formation Initial axis patterning After gastrulation, the embryo is completely undifferentiated and requires many different cues to initiate proper differentiation of the body. The top (roof plate, on the dorsal side of the embryo) and bottom (floor plate, on the ventral side) play a crucial role in these first steps: each acts through global signaling (signaling throughout the entire embryo) for dorsoventral neural patterning. After completion of the development of the dorsoventral axis, more local signaling occurs in the developing brain: developmental boundaries such as the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB), rhombomeres, and the ZLI aid in anteroposterior organization. Emergence of Shh expression Shortly after the beginning of dorsoventral patterning, Shh is expressed along the basal plate (the bottom) of the embryo, which functions in \\"ventralization of the neural tube, promotion of growth and proliferation, and formation of the hypothalamus\\". As the embryo continues to develop, Shh expression characteristic of the ZLI extends dorsally to form a wedge that eventually narrows to a strip at approximately 22 somites (the number of developed rhombomeres) or less than one day in zebrafish. Although Shh expression extends dorsally from the basal plate, the ZLI is capable of forming even without the basal plate or mesodermal tissue. Shh cooperates with dlx2 and fezl anteriorly and IRX3 and dbx1a posteriorly (genes expressed vary among different organisms), which are genes that are expressed in the prethalamus and thalamus, respectively. The ZLI is also characterized by a lack of lunatic fringe (lfng), which is observable even before Shh expression is observed in the forming ZLI. This indicates that cells are fated for ZLI formation before induction by Shh (n.b. Shh]' signals from the ZLI and is characteristic of the compartment during and after formation). Lfng is expressed very early (soon after gastrulation) in the region that will become the ZLI, but shortly thereafter expression recedes through migration of lfng-expressing cells to form the lfng-free wedge characteristic of the developing ZLI. Shh expression does not extend dorsally until a few hours later. Positioning The factors influencing the formation and location of the ZLI are widely studied but still disputed. Differences between different animal models further complicate elucidation of the genetic pathways, specifically between chicks/ mammalian models and zebrafish. Wnt (the family wingless) genes are crucial for the development of the ZLI both directly and indirectly in all animal systems. Along with the role of Wnt genes in patterning the anteroposterior axis through gradient polarization, Wnt8b is expressed within the ZLI itself and may help guide dorsal movement of Shh expression. The Wnt polarization gradient has been linked to induction of ZLI-patterning genes IRX3 and SIX3, which border the ZLI posteriorly and anteriorly, respectively. However, these genes have been shown to be non-essential for ZLI formation in zebrafish and have been reevaluated in other models. Specification of the ZLI may also involve the ventral tissues of the embryo: the prechordal and epichordal plates, or neuroepithelial tissue (see figure). Interactions between these tissues may be responsible for the recession of expression of lfng which allows dorsal movement Shh expression. The specific prechrodal and epichordal plates, characterized by expression of SIX3 and IRX3, respectively, may influence positioning of the ZLI more so than the genes themselves. The prechrodal plate ventrally borders the telencephalon, with the epichrodal plate posterior to it. Studies of the formation of the ZLI performed in zebrafish have revealed the significance of OTX2 and IRX1 in ZLI positioning. OTX2 expression characterizes the developing optic tectum, which is responsible for sight processing. Expression extends anteriorly and ends sharply at the ZLI, with high expression along the line where Shh is expressed. Before the ZLI is formed, OTX2] is expressed ubiquitously throughout the forebrain, and begins to recede to the position of the putative ZLI. Experiments where OTX2] expression was repressed showed no dorsal movement of Shh expression and no ZLI formation. Irx1, which is analogous to IRX3 in birds and mammals, is expressed posterior to the ZLI. Studies have suggested that while OTX2 positively restricts the ZLI anteriorly (Shh cannot be expressed where OTX2 is not), 'IRX1 negatively restricts the ZLI posteriorly. Other genes crucial for differentiation in the brain, including Fgf genes responsible for patterning of the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB), have been implicated in positioning of the ZLI. Studies on the role of Shh signaling in the ZLI were difficult to study for many years, because mutants lacking expression have many developmental deficits including lack of a diencephalon. Explant and lineage-labeling experiments previously described aided in elucidation of the role of Shh and other genes in differentiation of these tissues. More recently, the mouse Shh;Gli3 double mutant was found to have an enlarged diencephalon with a ring of Fgf8 and Wnt in place of the ZLI, indicating a complex interaction between Shh and these genes at the ZLI. This also indicates that other patterning cues are able to establish Fgf8 and Wnt signaling domains at the ZLI in the absence of Shh and Gli3. Differentiation after ZLI degradation After differentiation of the progenitor cells (at a precise stage yet to be fully determined), the ZLI and its lineage restriction disappears, allowing cells to migrate across the former boundary and the dorsal and ventral thalami to merge into one functional unit, as shown by replication-incompetent retroviral experiments that marked cells and showed their migration throughout the diencephalon. Signaling After establishment of the ZLI, shh has been shown to induce expression of thalamic and prethalamic markers, gbx2 and dlx2/ nkx2.1, respectively. This differential induction most likely is due to the expression of genes such as IRX3 in the thalamus: ectopic expression experiments showed that if IRX3, which is normally expressed in the developing thalamus, is expressed anterior to the ZLI, then the developing prethalamus will change identity. Note that these genes which help confer shh competence help to pattern the ZLI. Signaling from the ZLI cooperating with thalamic and prethalamic markers ensures the migration of post-mitotic (neural progenitor) cells to the mantle zone where the cells assemble into nuclei characteristic of the thalamus. These nuclei are the mechanism of the relay of information from the thalamus to the cortex. The thalamus itself is highly diverse, with each nucleus having distinct morphologies and physiologies according to the region of the brain to which it is connected. These differences are thought to originate in differential gene expression in the thalamus and prethalamus, which allows for a single structure with multiple different and separate functions once the two have merged and completed growth and differentiation. So a functional interplay between Shh from the ZLI and the bHLH factor Her6 (homolog to HES1) determines the neuronal identity within the thalamus: Her6 positive cells in the prethalamus and rostral thalamus differentiate into GABAergic inhibitory neurons, whereas her negative cells become glutamatergic relay neurons. Both cell types depend on Shh signal as trigger to initiate the developmental programme.Scholpp S, Delogu A, Gilthorpe J, Peukert D, Schindler S, Lumsden A. Her6 regulates the neurogenetic gradient and neuronal identity in the thalamus.

He is known for his measurements of the energy of black-body radiation which led Max Planck to the discovery of his radiation law. This was the genesis of quantum theory. After having attended realgymnasium W√∂hlerschule in Frankfurt am Main, he started in 1884 to study electrical engineering at the technical universities in Darmstadt and Berlin. H. Kant, Heinrich Rubens, Deutsche Biographie. The following year he switched to physics at the University of Berlin which was more to his liking. W. Westphal, Heinrich Rubens, Die Naturwissenschaften 10 (48), 1017‚Äì1020 (1922). After just one semester there he transferred to Strasbourg. There he benefited much from the lectures by August Kundt who in 1888 took over the vacant position of Hermann Helmholtz at the University of Berlin. Rubens followed after and got his doctors degree there the same year. In the period 1890‚Äì1896 he was employed as an assistant at the physics institute and made his habilitation in 1892. He was then a privatdozent and was allowed to teach. Already then he was praised for his experimental investigations of infrared radiation. H. Rubens, √úber Dispersion ultraroter Strahlen, Annalen der Physik 45, 238 (1892). The grave of Heinrich and Marie Rubens in Berlin. Rubens got a permanent position in 1896 as docent at the Technical University of Berlin in Berlin-Charlottenburg. He could continue his experimental research at the nearby Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt. It was there he in 1900 did his important measurements of black-body radiation which made him world-famous. He was promoted to professor the same year. After Paul Drude retired in 1906 from his professorship at the University in Berlin, the position was given to Rubens. He was at the same time appointed director of the physics institute. In this way he could influence and lead a large group of colleagues and students. The year after he was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences and became in 1908 a corresponding member G√∂ttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities. He participated at the two first Solvay conferences after having received the Rumford Medal in 1910 \\"on the ground of his researches on radiation, especially of long wave length.\\". Heinrich Rubens died in 1922 after a longer illness. At a memorial meeting in the science academy the following year Max Planck said about him: Jagdish Mehra, The Golden Age of Theoretical Physics, World Scientific, Singapore (2001). He is buried at the Alter St.-Matth√§us-Kirchhof in Berlin-Sch√∂neberg with his wife Marie. She took her life in 1941 for fear of being deported and killed by the Nazis. Stolpersteine, Marie Rubens, Berlin. The burial place is near that of Gustav Kirchhoff, who founded spectroscopy and formulated the first laws of black- body radiation. Scientific contributions Participants at the first Solvay conference 1911. Rubens is the third person from left standing in the back. Already as a student was Rubens fascinated by electromagnetic radiation as theoretically described by Maxwell and experimentally demonstrated by Hertz. Through the influence of Kundt he had become interested in understanding the optical properties of different materials. In his doctoral work he showed that reflection of light increases with increasing wavelengths into the infrared region. As a related result he could present an experimental verification of Maxwell's theory for electromagnetic waves in different media. G. Hertz, Rubens und die Maxwellsche Theorie, Die Naturwissenschaften, 10 (48), 1024‚Äì1027 (1922). This effort also turned into a demonstration of the validity of these equations for infrared radiation. Rubens succeeded in this for wavelengths up to 10 Œºm. J.C.D. Brand, Lines of Light: The Sources of Dispersive Spectroscopy, 1800‚Äì1930, Gordon & Breach, Luxembourg (1995). . Through the improvements of instruments and invention of new techniques he could measure infrared radiation for larger and larger wavelengths. One of his goals was to better understand the reflexion of radiation by metals and crystals. It was known that this became stronger for wavelengths which were absorbed. This lead him to a new, powerful method by selective reflexion from several crystals to isolate a narrow range of infrared wavelengths from a broader spectrum of radiation. Using such Reststrahlen he could in 1898 detect wavelengths of sizes around 60 Œºm. Together with Ferdinand Kurlbaum he started the same year to measure the energy content of black-body radiation in the far infrared region using this technique. For a fixed value of the wavelength they found that the energy increased linearly with the temperature. This was in disagreement with the ruling Wien's radiation law, but consistent with an alternative law proposed by Lord Rayleigh. On 7 October 1900 Rubens and his wife were invited to dinner by Max Planck. Rubens told then his host about the new measurements done at a wavelength 51 Œºm. A. Pais, Einstein and the Quantum Theory, Review of Modern Physics, 51 (4), 863‚Äì914 (1979). After the guests had left Planck managed to derive a new formula for the radiation energy which was consistent with the new results. He wrote it down on a postcard which Rubens received the following day. A few days later Rubens reported back that it seemed to fit all his measurements. G. Hettner, Die Bedeutung von Rubens Arbeiten f√ºr die Plancksche Strahlungsformel, Die Naturwisssenschaften 10 (48), 1033‚Äì1038 (1922). On 14 December Planck could present to Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft a derivation of his new radiation law based on the idea of quantization of energy. This was the \\"birthday\\" of the new quantum physics. H. Kangro, Early History of Planck's Radiation Law, Taylor & Francis Ltd, New York (1976). . In the following years Rubens could improve his measurements of infrared radiation and reached wavelengths of several hundred micrometres. This enabled him also to make more and more accurate tests of Plancks new radiation theory and related studies of matter which soon could be described by quantum mechanics. He was loved by his students and colleagues for his care and accuracy in all experimental work. In this connection he constructed in 1905 a Rubens' tube to illustrate standing sound waves using a flammable gas in a tube. This was probably inspired by his teacher Kundt's tube where fine sand or powder was used for the same purpose. References External links * H. Kant, Heinrich Rubens, Deutsche Biographie. * H.

Bynack More (Scottish Gaelic: A' Bheithneag Mh√≤r or Beinn Bheithneag) is a Scottish Mountain that is situated in the Cairngorms range, 16 kilometres east-south-east of the town of Aviemore in the Highland region.  Overview  Bynack More is a Munro and a Marilyn which reaches a height of 1090 metres (3576 feet) and stands slightly detached from the other peaks of the range in the north eastern corner. Because of this it tends to be ascended in a single mountain trip. It is typical of many of the Cairngorm mountains in that it is crowned by a large plateau; however, it does look conical when viewed from some angles. The plateau has huge granite tors dotted across it, known as the Barns of Bynack. The translation of the mountain's name from the Gaelic is unclear - some books give it as a ‚Äúkerchief or a cap‚Äù from the Gaelic beannag, others give it as ‚Äúbig little mountain‚Äù from beinneag while other sources suggest \\"chimney pot\\" from binneag, referring to the tors on the summit. In the past Bynack More has been known as Ben Bynack and Caiplich, named after the Water of Caiplich which rises on the mountains eastern slopes and flows into the Avon and then the Spey.  Geography  Bynack More is an elongated hill which is orientated north to south, the eastern slopes are steep and rocky as they drop 300 metres vertically to the headwaters of the Water of Caiplich. The hill has two subsidiary tops. Bynack Beag (964 metres) lies a kilometre to the north west and can be easily climbed when approaching the mountain from the north; Bynack More and Bynack Beag are twins and look impressive from the north above Strath Nethy. The other top is A‚ÄôChoinneach (Boggy Hill) which, at 1017 metres, used to be a Munro but was demoted in the 1981 tables reorganisation. This lies 1.5 kilometres south west and is an easy climb with an ascent of less than 80 metres. Bynack More can be climbed along with the nearby Cairn Gorm. The two are joined by a high col to the south west called The Saddle (807 metres). However, it is the impressive granite formation known as the Barns of Bynack that is the highlight of the plateau; they lie 500 metres south of the summit and the highest ones are roughly six metres high.  Ascents  The most popular ascent of Bynack More starts from Loch Morlich at grid reference and follows a good path passing through the attractive Ryvoan Pass with the charming Lochan Uaine (green lochan). The path swings east crossing the River Nethy and then the northern ridge of Bynack More is ascended to the summit. It is also possible to start from the car park at the Cairn Gorm ski centre (grid reference ) and ascend Cairn Gorm first before carrying onto Bynack More via The Saddle, though this is quite a rough walk. The summit cairn is made up of granite boulders and provides a unique view of Cairn Gorm across the craggy flanks of Strath Nethy; the Ben Avon plateau is also well seen.

He became a public figure in 1967 as the commanding officer of the 1st Battalion of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. Forces under his command reoccupied the Crater district of Aden which had been taken over by local police mutineers in what became known as \\"the last battle of the British empire\\". The reoccupation and subsequent control of the Crater were controversial and Mitchell resigned his army commission in 1968. Subsequently, he became a Conservative Member of Parliament and served one term from 1970 to February 1974. After participation in a failed business venture he subsequently worked as a security and military consultant. In 1989 Mitchell took a leading role in the Halo Trust, a not-for-profit organisation undertaking mine clearance in former war zones. Early life Mitchell's father (also called Colin) came from an Argyllshire fishing family. Mitchell (Snr) worked in a solicitor's office and for the MacBrayne ferry company before serving in the 10th Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in World War I. Mitchell (Snr) achieved the rank of captain (commissioned ‚Äòin the field‚Äô) and was awarded the Military Cross at the Second Battle of Ypres, but when the young Colin asked him how he would only say, 'Oh, shooting rabbits'. He was badly gassed in 1918. After the war, he worked in the City of London and married a Glaswegian woman (n√©e Gilmour) whose father worked as a manager for the LMS Railway company. The couple took up residence in the South London suburb of Purley where they had two children ‚Äì Colin and Henrietta. The family lived in a modest semi-detached house and Colin would attend services at the local Presbyterian Church wearing a kilt.The Independent, obituary, early paragraphs on family history in 'free to view' section :Lt-Col Colin Mitchell, by Tam Dalyell - 24 July 1996 Mitchell received his formal education at the Whitgift Grammar School in Croydon. Military career In 1940, at age 15, Mitchell enlisted in the Home Guard, and may have been the youngest Home Guard soldier. In May 1943 he joined the British Army, enlisting as a private in the Royal West Kent Regiment. He soon became a Lance-Corporal and instructed newcomers in physical training. One of his fellow instructors was Stan Cullis who had been the captain of the Wolverhampton Wanderers cup side at Wembley in 1939 and was the captain of England at the time. Mitchell was commissioned into the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in 1944. He fought in the final battles of the Italian campaign, and was lightly wounded in the advance on Ferrara. Despite this, his wartime experience inclined him to take up a military career.The Independent, obituary :Lt-Col Colin Mitchell, by Tam Dalyell - 24 July 1996 He was appointed to a regular commission on 21 December 1946. Following the war, he saw action against Jewish guerrillas during the Palestine Emergency. While in Palestine, he participated in operations to arrest Jewish militants. During Operation Agatha, which saw most of the Jewish political leadership in Palestine detained, Mitchell's mission was to arrest Moshe Shertok (a future Prime Minister of Israel). Initially, his unit raided the wrong house. However, they were later able to find and arrest him. In July 1946, he witnessed the King David Hotel bombing: he and his company commander were within 300 feet of the building when the bombing occurred. While on a personal reconnaissance mission, he was shot and wounded by one of his own Bren gunners, who mistook him for a guerrilla. After recovering from his injuries, he was transferred from his regiment to become aide-de-camp to General Gordon MacMillan, the commander of British forces in Palestine and Transjordan. He spent a total of three years in Palestine. While there, he made friends among both the Arabs and Jews, including Moshe Dayan, a future Israeli general who would become one of Mitchell's heroes, as well as Moshe Shertok, who developed a cordial relationship with Mitchell after his arrest and corresponded with him for years afterward, when he became a senior Israeli government official.http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1971/nov/17/northern- ireland-compton-committeesLt-Col C C 'Mad Mitch' Mitchell In 1950, with the outbreak of the Korean War, he was allowed to rejoin his regiment so he could deploy to Korea. He participated in the initial advance into North Korea, seeing close-quarters combat along the way. His regiment ultimately reached Taechon, near the Chinese border on the Yalu River. When the Chinese Army intervened and crossed the Yalu River in overwhelming numbers, the regiment was forced to take part in the retreat of UN forces, and later helped hold the line against Communist forces when UN forces consolidated. The regiment held a position known as \\"Frostbite Ridge\\", where they had to endure freezing conditions. They held the area through the winter until the thaw, and in 1951, they began to advance. However, shortly afterward, they were relieved and withdrawn. Following his service in Korea, Mitchell was posted in Britain, but in late 1957, he returned to the Argylls as a company commander with the 1st Battalion, and was posted to Cyprus. At the time, the Cyprus Emergency was in full swing. Mitchell was placed in charge of the coastal towns of Paphos and Ktima, where his men engaged in counter-insurgency operations against EOKA guerrillas. They faced both conventional EOKA raids and forest fires deliberately lit by EOKA fighters and local villagers who were motivated by the money they would receive to fight them.Edwards, Aaron: Mad Mitch's Tribal Law: Aden and the End of Empire Mitchell was subsequently posted to the British Army of the Rhine with the rest of the regiment, and then joined the King's African Rifles, and was posted to East Africa. Soon afterward, he saw action in Zanzibar with the KAR in breaking up disturbances between the island's Arab and African populations, which had begun during a general election and had descended into widespread rioting and clashes. He also participated in operations on the Northern Frontier District. At the time, Somali guerrillas were launching raids as part of a campaign to unite the region with Somalia, and the frontiers with other neighbouring states were also volatile. In one incident, Mitchell was searching for Somali guerrillas in a low-flying helicopter, and an elephant attempted to attack the helicopter, nearly clipping it with its tusks. It has been claimed that while with the KAR Mitchell was instrumental in obtaining a commission for Idi Amin, who later became President of Uganda. Mitchell's familiarity with the Scottish clan system made him more comfortable with African tribal issues than was the case with his English contemporaries. Impressed by Mitchell and other Scottish officers, Amin would later adopt the title King of Scotland.The New York Times:Mitchell's 1996 obituary Following his service in Kenya, Mitchell rejoined the Argylls, which was sent to Borneo to participate in the Indonesian-Malaysian Confrontation. Mitchell participated in a series of clashes with Indonesian forces. After six months of jungle warfare, the regiment was sent back to Singapore to recuperate. Mitchell was posted back to the UK as a staff officer. Throughout all this time Mitchell was making a reputation as a bold and efficient officer, passing out top of Staff College and serving as GSO1 on the staff of Chief of the Defence staff, Lord Mountbatten. Mitchell was promoted lieutenant in 1947, captain in 1952, major in 1959, and his success in a wide range of appointments won him brevet rank as a lieutenant-colonel in 1964. Mitchell was promoted to substantive lieutenant-colonel on 31 December 1966, and made Commanding Officer 1st Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (the ‚ÄòArgylls‚Äô) on 12 January 1967. Aden In 1967 the British Aden colony consisted of the City of Aden and attached Protectorate areas, with a total land mass similar to that of the United Kingdom. These territories enjoyed a degree of self government as the Federation of South Arabia. Within the City itself was the old quarter known as \\"The Crater\\", so called because it was sited in an extinct volcano.Pirates to Grenades Aden The Crater district had an area of approximately one square mile and housed approximately 80,000 inhabitants.Having Been A Soldier, p. 1. The figure is repeated on p. 204. Between 1963 and 1967 the British administration faced a low intensity insurgency from groups of armed Arab nationalists who were seeking independence for Aden and competing for future power after the inevitable British withdrawal. This insurgency was designated the \\"Aden Emergency\\". Uprising in Aden City In late June 1967 the 1st Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders was due to take over responsibility for security in Aden's Crater district from the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers. However, before this took place, on 20 June 1967 elements of the locally recruited Aden Police mutinied, seizing control over the district in alliance with insurgent forces, staging several ambushes of British troops in the Crater district's streets. Eight British soldiers from a transport unit were attacked and killed by the mutineers, and other British troops were killed in coordinated separate attacks. Three men from the Argylls (its Officer Commanding 'D' company, along with two privates) were killed when a patrol of the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers that they were accompanying was ambushed. All but one of the patrol being shot and killed. For some days a stand-off around the Crater existed between British Forces and the mutineers, with the authorities hesitating. Then, just before sunset on 3 July 1967 Mitchell commanded an operation that reoccupied the Crater. The Argylls and other units entered and reoccupied the Crater, accompanied by 15 bagpipers playing \\"Scotland the Brave\\"The Argylls in Aden :reocupation of the Crater and the Argylls' regimental charge, \\"Monymusk\\".Tam Dalyell, ‚ÄòMitchell, Colin Campbell (1925‚Äì1996)‚Äô (subscription required), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edition, January 2006, . Retrieved 13 February 2008 Mitchell subsequently used what were described as ‚Äústrong arm methods‚Äù to maintain order in the Crater district for the remaining months before British withdrawal from Aden. The reoccupation itself was almost bloodless. One local man was killed and control of the Treasury building holding the Federation's currency reserves was restored.Daily Record, Mad Mitch in Aden Mitchell then used an integrated system of observation posts, patrols, checkpoints and intelligence gathering to maintain the Crater as a pacified area whilst security conditions elsewhere in Aden began to deteriorate. However, British troops in the Crater became subject to sniper and grenade attacks. Allegations were made of abuses by Mitchell and the troops under his command. There were also allegations that British troops had engaged in some looting within the district. Mitchell used the Chartered Bank building in the Crater district as his headquarters, and army snipers positioned upon its roof would shoot at anyone thought to represent a threat in the streets below. A BBC reporter stated \\"Once we stood together in Crater watching the Argylls stacking, as in a butcher's shop, the bodies of four Arab militants they had just shot and Mad Mitch said: 'It was like shooting grouse, a brace here and a brace there'.\\" Mitchell (nicknamed 'Mad Mitch' by sections of the press) imposed what was described as \\"Argyll law\\" on the Crater. The reoccupation of the Crater made Mitchell popular with sections of the British press and public. At the same time it brought disapproval from Mitchell's superiors in both the Army and the High Commission.Army history :the Argylls' 1967 Aden campaign He was criticized for being a publicity-seeker, and there were accusations that the troops under his command lacked discipline. One High Commission official in Aden describing the Argylls as \\"a bunch of Glasgow thugs\\" (a statement for which he later apologised). The reoccupation and subsequent control of the Crater district were controversial. General-Officer-Commanding Middle East Land Forces, Major- General Philip Tower, feared that it would merely provoke trouble. He was of the view that engaging in a full reoccupation of the Crater, with its risk of casualties, was pointless given that British withdrawal from Aden was imminent and British strategy was moving to the role of neutral peacekeeping. Tower had authorized a probe into the Crater but Mitchell had used this authority to carry out a full military reoccupation. Tower subsequently ordered Mitchell to \\"throttle back\\" on the operation. Mitchell stated that he considered Tower's approach to be ‚Äúwet hen tactics‚Äù. The situation that developed was described in The Times as follows:The Times, 24 July 1996 Questions were raised in the House of Commons about the events in Aden. Tam Dalyell (Labour, West Lothian) asked whether it was true that: \\"Mitchell disobeyed operational and administrative orders of his senior officers during the recapture of the Crater\\"?The Times, 17 July 1968, ‚ÄùIndiscipline Denied by Colonel Mitchell‚Äù Mitchell himself later stated that he had been rebuked over the reoccupation by General Tower. The nature of this rebuke was explained by British Government's Defence Minister Denis Healey as follows:The Times, 25 July 1968 The final British withdrawal from Aden took place in November 1967. Mitchell and the Argylls arrived back at their Plymouth garrison on 27 November. Between July and November the regiment had suffered 5 dead and 25 wounded in Aden, a near 5% casualty rate. Unlike all the other battalion commanders from Aden, Mitchell was not decorated, receiving instead only a Mention in Despatches. It was also indicated to him that further career advancement within the army was unlikely. Interviewed by the BBC in 1985, General Tower said \\"Colonel Mitchell, for reasons of his own, wanted to cut a dash with the Argylls in the Crater\\" thereby accepting unnecessary casualties.BBC documentary End of Empire - Aden, available on YouTube, see minute 42:30 onwards Reports began to circulate to the effect that the Argylls were to be disbanded as part of a general cutback in defence spending. In July 1968, Mitchell gave notice of his intention to resign his commission at the end of the year. Although he had not given the customary 7 months‚Äô notice required of senior officers, his resignation was accepted with effect from 1 October 1968. Political career Once he was a civilian, Mitchell assumed a prominent public role in a ‚ÄúSave the Argylls‚Äù campaign to stop the abolition of the regiment. He published a memoir entitled Having Been a Soldier, undertook some freelance journalism and briefly took a job as management trainee with Beaverbrook Newspapers. However, he had become a popular public figure from his time in Aden, and turned this to his advantage when he started a new career in politics. In 1969 he was adopted as the Conservative Party's parliamentary candidate for Aberdeenshire West. This was a Liberal Party held seat, although the sitting member was retiring at the next election. Mitchell took the seat with a 5,000 vote majority in the 1970 general election.1970 General Election :results, see Aberdeenshire West His main opponent in that election was Laura Grimond, wife of former Liberal leader Jo Grimond. He proved to be an energetic and effective constituency M.P. He also served for a year as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Scotland. However, it became apparent that he was not likely to develop a ministerial career. His main political interest was the British Army, and he was frequently critical of its leadership. In August 1970 he was quoted as having referred to \\"... those bastards in Whitehall\\".The Times, 7 August 1970, ‚ÄúEmaciated Thin Red Line Survives‚Äù He gravitated towards the right wing of the Conservative Party, opposing the United Kingdom's membership of the European Economic Community, economic sanctions being placed upon Rhodesia, and the arms embargo on Israel. He also became a prominent member of both the Monday Club and the 'Anglo-Rhodesian Society'. Mitchell became known as a maverick M.P., and was one of 39 Conservatives who defied the Party whip to vote against entry to the EEC in the Commons vote on 28 October 1971.BBC report :voting on the EU Although never promoted to ministerial office, Mitchell was a high-profile backbench M.P., in demand by society and the media. He was a popular member of the Garrick Club, and was reported to enjoy a ‚Äúgregarious social life‚Äù in London.The Times, 25 July 1996 In 1973 he was approached by a consortium that was planning to establish a large sporting and agricultural estate in Scotland, which invited him to take a stake in the project and become the project's General-Manager with a generous salary. Mitchell accepted and announced he would not be seeking re-election to Parliament on the basis that he ‚Äú‚Ä¶could not afford to be an M.P.‚Äù ‚Äî a remark that would come back to haunt him.The Times, 16 January 1974 He left Parliament at the time of the February 1974 general election, against the advice of both his wife Sue and fellow maverick M.P Tam Dalyell. 1974-1989 The Scottish estate project failed and Mitchell became unemployed. He later stated that giving up his seat in Parliament had been a disastrous mistake. Mitchell spent much of the next 10 years trying to get back into Parliament. He applied to several constituency Conservative Associations, including Bournemouth East in August 1977, but at every selection interview the question was raised as to why he had given up Aberdeenshire West in 1974. No winnable constituency would adopt him.The Times, 25 August 1977 He remained on the fringes of Conservative Party politics, The Times Diary columnist reporting on a meeting of the Monday Club at the 1976 Conservative Party conference where he had made a speech on the subject of Rhodesia:The Times, 8 October 1976 During this period Mitchell remained sporadically active in a series of consultancies, mostly of a military or security nature. He is known to have provided services to backers of the Mujahideen insurgents in Afghanistan and Contra rebels in Nicaragua.New York Times :Mitchell's 1996 obituary In November 1980, Mitchell praised the Mujahideen as \\"gallant fighters... expressing themselves, as Afghans know best, in the romantic tradition of sniping, raiding and brigandry.\\" He urged Western leaders to provide them with military training and equipment, and to select \\"proven guerilla fighters\\" from their ranks for training as future leaders of Afghanistan. However, Mitchell became increasingly dissatisfied with his situation. The Halo Trust In 1989, Mitchell took a leading role in the Halo Trust (the hazardous areas life-support organization). This non- profit making organization undertook de-mining operations in former war zones. It employed a core of (mostly British and Commonwealth) de-mining experts and a large number of locally recruited and trained personnel. Most of the Halo personnel were former servicemen.Halo Trust :website Halo became active around the world in areas such as Mozambique, Cambodia and Afghanistan. Mitchell appeared comfortable in his work with Halo. It raised his public profile once again, and in a manner that was both positive and uncontroversial. Death Mitchell died in his 71st year on 20 July 1996 at Westminster in London, after a short illness. His obituary in The Independent was written by his friend the Labour MP Tam Dalyell. Dalyell stated : Personal life Mitchell married Jean Hamilton (Sue) Phillips in April 1956. Phillips was the daughter of Wing Commander Stephen Phillips, R.A.F., and was a native of Meikleour, Perthshire. The couple had three children (2 sons and 1 daughter), the youngest of whom (Colina) was born in 1965. Their son, Dr. Angus Mitchell, is a noted authority on the life of Irish revolutionary Roger Casement.Irish democrat :see 5th image One observer later described Phillips as: \\"his marvellous wife ... who backed him through thick and thin - mostly thin\\".The Independent obituary :Lt-Col Colin Mitchell, by Tam Dalyell - 24 July 1996 References The two major sources for the article are Having Been a Soldier (Mitchell's autobiography) London: Hamilton, 1969. , and from Tam Dalyell's long obituary of Mitchell published in The Independent on 24 July 1996.

The Commission produced its report in 1948 which proposed large changes to county-level areas of local government and changes in the structure and division of powers between tiers of administration. The Commission's proposals were not acted on, and it was disbanded in 1949. Background Alterations to local government boundaries had been suspended with the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. Previously they had been carried out by a number of processes: county boroughs could be constituted or extended by private act of parliament, while county councils were to carry out reviews of county districts (non-county boroughs, urban and rural districts) on a ten yearly cycle. There was no general procedure for adjusting boundaries between administrative counties, or for amalgamating them. The different procedures were not coordinated. The wartime coalition government published a white paper in January 1945, entitled Local government in England and Wales during the period of reconstruction.Cmd. 6579 The document proposed the establishment of a Local Government Boundary Commission with executive powers to alter council areas, taking over the powers of the county councils and Minister for Health to change areas. In future all proposed changes by local authorities were to be submitted to the Commission. The Commission was to consider administration in each geographical county (the administrative county plus associated county boroughs) and see if there was a prima facie case for a review. If it felt a review was warranted the commission was to notify the Minister and the relevant county council, who could then require the holding of an inquiry into local government in the county. The problem of local government in the County of London and Middlesex were deemed to be a special case, with the extension of the County of London, the probable disappearance of Middlesex and annexing of parts of the surrounding counties envisaged. The Commission was not to be allowed to consider these issues, which were to be considered by an \\"authoritative body\\" at a later stage. It was recognised that Middlesex contained a number of towns \\"large enough on any standard for county borough status\\" but the commissioners were not given the power to \\"entertain applications for county borough status in the county\\". The Commission was to have the power to: * Extend or create county boroughs * Reduce the status of county boroughs to non-county boroughs * Merge contiguous county boroughs * Merge small administrative counties The decisions of the commission were to be subject to parliamentary review. The proposals in the white paper were enacted as the Local Government (Boundary Commission) Act 1945 (1945 c.38). It received the royal assent on the last day in office of the caretaker government that had taken over from the coalition in May.\\"Back to Planning\\", The Times, 6 October 1945 Outside observers considered that the establishment of the Commission meant that the Government did not intend to make any changes in the basic structure of local government, and noted that the Commission lacked the power to recommend radical changes such as the establishment of regional councils.The Councillor's Handbook by H. Townshend-Rose and H. R. Page, 2nd Edition, Sir Isaac Pitman & Sons Ltd, London, 1946, pp. 6‚Äì7. Appointment of commissioners Following the 1945 general election, Aneurin Bevan was appointed the Secretary of State for Health in the new Labour government, and took over responsibility for the appointment of the Commission. The five commissioners were appointed by Royal Warrant on 25 October 1945.London Gazette, issue no.37325, 26 October 1945 The chairman was Sir Malcolm Trustram Eve and the deputy chairman Sir John Evelyn Maude. The three other members were Sir George Hammond Etherton, Sir James Frederick Rees and William Holmes. The Minister for Health made regulations governing the work of the commission. Any alterations in the status or boundaries of local government areas were to create \\"individually and collectively effective and convenient units of local government administration.\\" The commission was given nine main factors which were to govern their decisions: *Community of interest *Development, or anticipated development *Economic and industrial characteristics *Financial resources *Physical features, including, but not exclusively, suitable boundaries, means of communication, and accessibility of administrative centres and centres of business and social life *Population size, distribution and characteristics *Record of administration by local authorities concerned *Size and shape of the area *Wishes of the inhabitantsE. W. Gilbert, The Boundaries of Local Government Areas, The Geographical Journal, Vol. 111, No. 4/6. (April - June, 1948), pp. 172-198 Work of the Commission In April 1946 the Commission wrote to county and county borough councils, asking for information on any boundary proposals they were considering. By August they had received replies from 80 of 83 county boroughs and 42 of 61 county councils, stating they were seeking boundary reviews. Acting on the information they had received, the Commission prioritised the review of areas into two categories, \\"A\\" and \\"B\\". Reviews of areas in category A were to proceed as soon as possible, while the review of category B areas would be held back until July, 1947 (except where they would affect the boundaries of areas in category A). The first reviews concerned the claims of Dagenham, Ilford, Leyton, Luton, Rochester-Chatham-Gillingham, and Walthamstow for county borough status. Among the category A reviews were the boundaries of Bedfordshire, the areas of Surrey within the Greater London area, and a request by the municipal boroughs of Beckenham and Bromley to form a joint county borough.Local government boundaries - Commission's order of priority, The Times, 30 August 1946 First report On 22 April 1947, the Commission presented its first report to parliament, covering its work in 1946. The following investigations had been begun:Review of local boundaries - first decisions in May, The Times, 23 April 1947 *Plymouth *Bootle and Liverpool *Luton *Eleven Welsh counties (excluding Glamorgan) *South-west Essex (East Ham, West Ham, Barking, Chingford, Dagenham, Ilford, Leyton, Romford, Walthamstow, Wanstead and Woodford, Chigwell and Hornchurch) *Southampton *Grimsby *Twelve county boroughs in south and east Lancashire (Blackburn, Bolton, Burnley, Bury, Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, St Helens, Salford, Warrington and Wigan) *Part of East Anglia (Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, Isle of Ely, Lincolnshire (Holland, Kesteven and Lindsey), Soke of Peterborough, Rutland, Norfolk and the county boroughs of Great Yarmouth, Lincoln and Norwich) *Chatham, Gillingham and Rochester *Dudley, Smethwick, Walsall, West Bromwich and Wolverhampton *Bath and Bristol *Cheltenham and Gloucester *Portsmouth *Sunderland In addition, the report recommended the ending of the distinction between (non-county) boroughs, rural districts, and urban districts, with all to become known as \\"county districts\\". The privileges granted to boroughs under municipal charters were to be preserved, however. The Commission also sought an amendment of its powers, to extend its power to divide districts to municipal boroughs as well. It was announced that decisions in the \\"urgent\\" category A areas would be given the following month.Local boundaries (editorial), The Times, 23 April 1947 First recommendations Decisions on the category A areas were announced 1 May 1947: *Liverpool: The county borough council had sought to annex the county borough of Bootle and the borough of Crosby, the urban districts of Huyton- with-Roby and Litherland and much of West Lancashire and Whiston rural districts. The commission proposed a much smaller extension to include parts of the two rural districts. *Bootle: The county borough was to be enlarged by gaining the borough of Crosby, the urban districts of Litherland and parts of West Lancashire rural district. The Commission felt that without the extensions Bootle would no longer be a viable local government unit. *Plymouth: the county borough had sought to annex a large area from the two adjoining counties. From Cornwall would have come the borough of Saltash, Torpoint urban district and part of St Germans rural district, and from Devon the entire Plympton St Mary rural district and the southern part of Tavistock rural district. The Commission limited its proposed extension to two parishes from the Plympton rural district. *Hull: The county borough was to be enlarged by the absorption of Haltemprice urban district and parts of Beverley and Holderness rural districts. *Southampton: Interim recommendations were made to allow the county borough to acquire territory in order to provide housing following wartime damage. The corporation had sought to gain part of the borough of Eastleigh, but the extension was limited to small parts of the rural districts of Romsey and Stockbridge and Winchester. *Grimsby: The Commission deferred a decision on the county borough's boundary. Grimsby corporation sought to annex the adjacent borough of Cleethorpes and much of Grimsby rural district, which would probably have ceased to exist as a result. *Luton: The borough had sought county borough status and an extension of its boundaries. The Commission deferred a decision on the status of the borough, and proposed a small enlargement of its area. Suggestions that the borough should merge with that of Dunstable were rejected. *Lancashire and North Cheshire: No final decision on the future of fourteen county boroughs in the area were made. If all the requests for extensions had been granted, much of south Lancashire would have been made up entirely of county boroughs, and the Commission sought to review the areas around Manchester and Salford before making proposals for the fourteen boroughs. *Eastern Counties: The Commission considered that six administrative counties (Huntingdonshire, Isle of Ely, Holland, Kesteven, Rutland, and Soke of Peterborough) were too small to be effective units, and amalgamations would be necessary.Town and county boundaries - First decisions of the Commission, The Times, 2 May 1947 Two weeks later the Commission issued a statement on further proposed changes: *St Helens: The county borough had asked for an extension to absorb two neighbouring urban districts and six parishes. The Commission issued an interim decision, restricting the proposed extension to most of the parish of Windle in the Whiston rural district, as the borough needed land for housing purposes. Further extensions were deferred until the consideration of the wider area. *Oldham: The Commission proposed extending Oldham county borough to absorb Lees urban district and part of Limehurst rural district, the rest of which was to be split between the borough of Ashton-under-Lyne and Failsworth urban district. As in St Helens, this was an interim decision to allow the borough's housing programme to progress. *South-west Essex: The Commission had not made a final decision on the area, but hoped to make a decision on \\"broad principles\\" within a year. *Staffordshire: The Commission also hoped to make a decision on seven county boroughs within a year, noting that the Ministry of Town and Country Planning was to carry out a comprehensive planning survey of the geographical county, which might effect local government reforms.Local government boundaries - Commission's proposals, The Times, 16 May 1947 Second report The Commission's second report was issued in April 1948.Report of the Local Government Boundary Commission for the year 1947 It contained a notably strong section outlining the deficiencies with the existing system of local government,Bruce Wood, \\"The Process of Local Government Reform 1966-1974\\", George Allen & Unwin, 1976, p. 46. and therefore the report made comprehensive proposals for local government areas throughout England, and suggestions for Wales.The Times, 9 April 1948 It was later to be argued that in producing this report, the Commission had significantly exceeded its brief.Bruce Wood, \\"The Process of Local Government Reform 1966-1974\\", George Allen & Unwin, 1976, p. 36. The commission recommended the creation of: *20 one-tier counties (with a target population 200,000 to 1 million) *47 two-tier counties (target population 200,000 to 500,000) *63 \\"most-purpose\\" new county boroughs, which were to be part of the two-tier counties for certain purposes (target population less than 200,000) One- tier counties The proposed one-tier counties were based on twenty large county boroughs, which were to continue to manage all local government services in the area. Two of these counties were to be formed from the amalgamation of a number of existing councils. #Birmingham #Bradford #Bristol #Central Sussex (Brighton county borough, Hove municipal borough, and Portslade, Shoreham and Southwick urban districts) #Coventry #Croydon #Derby #East Ham #Kingston-upon-Hull #Leeds #Leicester #Newcastle upon Tyne #North Staffordshire (Stoke-on-Trent county borough, Newcastle-under-Lyme municipal borough, and Kidsgrove urban district) #Nottingham #Plymouth #Portsmouth #Sheffield #Southampton #Sunderland #West Ham Two-tier counties The two-tier counties were based on the existing administrative counties. The commission felt that in order to provide effective local government a county must have a population of more than 200,000 and less than a million. From this it followed that a number of small counties would need to be merged, and large ones divided. The small counties requiring union were: Cambridgeshire, Herefordshire, Huntingdonshire, Isle of Ely, Lincolnshire (Parts of Holland), Lincolnshire (Parts of Kesteven), Rutland, East Suffolk, West Suffolk, Soke of Peterborough, Westmorland and Worcestershire.

Glamorgan was to remain two-tier, with Merthyr Tydfil as a county borough within it, while Cardiff was to be a one-tier county. No decision had been made on Swansea. The remaining eleven administrative counties were to be grouped as either two, three, four, or five new counties. Third report and abolition On 25 March 1949, the Minister of Health Aneurin Bevan replied to a written question in the House of Commons stating that \\"it will not be practicable to introduce comprehensive legislation on local government reconstruction in the near future\\".Hansard, House of Commons 5th series, vol 463, col 74. This meant that the proposals in their previous report would not be carried out, and the Commission's annual report for 1948 which followed in April 1949 was therefore reduced to recommending orders under existing legislation. The report also noted that the four proposals for combinations of Welsh counties had been unanimously rejected by the county councils. On 27 June 1949 a decision to abolish the commission was announced in parliament. The Minister praised the work done by the Commission, but noted that it did not have the power under the 1945 Act to alter the structure or vary the functions of local government. The Government recognised that it was difficult for the Commission to continue with its work without considering these factors. It was therefore repealing the Act creating the body, restoring the situation for local boundary reviews to that pertaining in 1945. The Government was to carry out a review of the structures and functions of local administration, including London, although the Minister was unable to give a date for its commencement. Local government academic Bruce Wood, reviewing the history of the Commission nearly 30 years later, remarked that its refusal to be constrained in its 1947 report meant the Commission had \\"committed suicide\\". The winding-up of the Commission was enacted by the Local Government Boundary Commission (Dissolution) Act 1949 (12, 13 & 14 Geo. 6 c.83). The planned review never took place. Following the 1950 general election, the Labour government was returned with a small majority. In a debate on local government in the Commons on 17 July 1951, George Lindgren, Parliamentary Secretary for Local Government and Planning stated that the Government was waiting for the results of negotiations between the local authority associations. In the absence of such agreement, no legislation could be introduced due to the state of the parties in the House. The Minister for Housing and Local Government Hugh Dalton, added that \\"the reform of local government was the type of question regarding which, in a parliament like the present, with the Government having a narrow majority, comprehensive legislation was not realistic.\\"Local government - Call for revision of boundaries, The Times, 18 July 1951 The statement effectively delayed reform until the next parliament, a fact not lost on the commission's former chairman who wrote to The Times bemoaning the fact that \\"The Government's review of local government structure, which was stated in 1949 to be already in being, appears to have led nowhere. This lack of decision is bad enough for local government, but surely the reconstitution of district authorities, without previous consideration of any of the functions or boundaries of the existing counties and county boroughs, or even any power to consider them simultaneously, would be a farce.\\"Review of local government - difficulties facing county boroughs, Malcolm Trustram Eve, Letter to the Editor of The Times, 24 July 1951 The Labour party lost power to the Conservatives in the general election of 25 October 1951, and no further review of local government was put forward until the publication of the white papers leading to the Local Government Act 1958.

It is a match play format played against the course, with scoring based on the number of strokes taken compared to the par or bogey of each hole. In this context, bogey is meant in the traditional sense as the score a good player would expect on the hole, usually par but occasionally one stroke more. The winner of the competition is the player with the highest differential of holes \\"won\\" to holes \\"lost\\", with the result on each hole normally based on the players handicap-adjusted score. Par has similarities to the popular Stableford scoring system in that competition is against the course on a hole-by-hole basis, and the occasional very bad hole does not massively affect the overall result. Because of this it also has the same advantage of improving pace of play in large club competitions as holing out is not required once the hole is lost. Unlike Stableford however, there is no reward for a handicap-adjusted eagle (or better). Overview For ease of explanation, assume a player's handicap gives them one stroke per hole (e.g., an 18-hole handicap of 18). This player, playing to their handicap on a given day, will average a bogey on each hole. Playing 'to' ones handicap is expected and so there is no reward or punishment due when a bogey five is recorded on a par four. Thus, a 0 (zero/half) is recorded. A double-bogey six (one over what's expected from a player on an 18 handicap, would incur a penalty of a minus '‚àí' (loss). A four (a genuine, unadjusted par) is one better than an '18-handicapper' would be expected to score and would earn a plus '+' (win). However, for this golfer, sixes and above still incur just one minus '‚àí'. Likewise, fours and below earn just one plus '+'. At the end of the round, pluses and minuses are reconciled (a minus cancels out a plus). If a player finishes with two pluses, they are 'two up' or 'plus two' (+2). The opposite applies if they finish with two minuses ‚àí 'two down'; 'minus 2'; '‚àí2'.

Its main characteristic is humor. Through sarcasm, mockery and irony, the main groups and the people of the street \\"purge\\" the most pressing problems of today.El Pa√≠s (12 february, 2018) The whole city participates in the carnival for more than two weeks each year, and the presence of this fiesta is almost constant in the city because of the recitals and contests held throughout the year. The main characteristics of the carnival in C√°diz are the acerbic criticisms, the droll plays on words, stinging sarcasm, and the irreverence of parody.PAY√ÅN SOTOMAYOR, P. (1983). El habla de C√°diz en las letras de su Carnaval. Carnaval en C√°diz, 65-85. While some carnivals elsewhere in the world stress the spectacular, the glamorous, or the scandalous in costumes, C√°diz distinguishes itself with how clever and imaginative its carnival attire is. It is traditional to paint the face as a humble substitute for a mask. On Saturday, everyone wears a costume, which, many times, is related to the most polemical aspects of the news. However, the Carnival of C√°diz is most famous for the satirical groups of performers called chirigotas. Their music and their lyrics are in the center of the carnival. Carnival of C√°diz is a sociological phenomenon of special singularity. Its historical evolution, from its most remote origins until today, has endowed it with a marked rebellious character. In addition, the development of their groups (mainly their choirs, chirigotas, comparsas and quartets) differentiates them from other carnivals in the world and also identifies them as a communicational phenomenon. It is a vehicle that generates information, opinion and entertainment, but also in its subversive nature, in its condition of counter-power.Sacaluga Rodr√≠guez, I. (2014). El Carnaval de C√°diz como generador de informaci√≥n, opini√≥n y contrapoder: an√°lisis cr√≠tico de su impacto en l√≠nea y fuera de l√≠nea (Doctoral dissertation).  History  The first references to the carnivals of C√°diz that are known come from the sixteenth century. In the process of its own organisation , the Cadiz Carnival takes on peculiarities of Italian, explicable by the fundamentally Genoese influence that C√°diz knew since the fifteenth century. After the Turks' displacement to the Mediterranean, Italian merchants moved to the West, finding C√°diz a place of settlement perfectly communicated with the commercial objectives that the Genoese were looking for: the north and center of Africa. The masks, the serpentines, the confetti are assimilated from the Italian carnival.  16th century  The first documentary references to the celebration of the carnival are from historian Agust√≠n de Horozco. At the end of the 16th century, during carnival time, the inhabitants of Cadiz plucked the flowers from the pots to throw them at each other as a joke. Other documents that record the celebration of the carnivals are the Synod Constitutions of 1591 and the Statutes of the Seminary of C√°diz in 1596, both contain indications so that the religious did not participate in the festivities in a way that the seculars did. These references, about the Carnival, confirm that already at the end of the 16th century, the festivities should have deep roots among the people of Cadiz.Agust√≠n de Orozco (1845) Historia de la ciudad de C√°diz: Imprenta de don Manuel Bosch, 1845. Hay ed. moderna de Arturo Morgado Garc√≠a, 2001.  17th century  There are also references from the seventeenth century. A document of 1636 recognizes the impotence of the civil power against the popular celebration. A letter from General Mencos dated in C√°diz on February 7, 1652, complains that the Cadiz workers refused to repair their boat because they were in Carnestolendas. There is also evidence of the events that took place in 1678, the year in which the cleric Nicol√°s Aznar was accused of having adulterous relations with Antonia Gil Morena, whom he had met during the carnival.Cuadrado, U., & Barbosa, F. (1999). El Carnaval de C√°diz. Or√≠genes y evoluci√≥n: Siglos XVI-XIX.  18th century to 20th century Beginning the 18th century, the orders are repeated frequently, trying to banish the Carnival. In 1716 masked dances were prohibited by the Crown, prohibitions that were repeated throughout this century. In spite of everything, there are testimonies that confirm the disrespect of the orders was quite remarkable. In the carnival of 1776, excesses were committed in the convent of Santa Mar√≠a and in that of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Candelaria, which caused scandals in the city. This same year, the British traveler Henry Swinburne visited the city, who left testimony about the Carnival celebrations of the people of Cadiz. Swinburne, H. (1787) \\"Travels through Spain in the years 1775 and 1776\\" Biblioteca Virtual de Andaluc√≠a, online consultation 14 March, 2018 These festivities were celebrated even during the French invasion. However, there was a time during which the celebration was suspended: on February 5, 1937, during the Civil War and the Battle of the Ebro, the prohibition to celebrate any type of carnival in Spain was published in the ‚ÄúBolet√≠n Oficial del Estado‚Äù. Bolet√≠n Oficial del Estado (BOE), February 5, 1937. It was not until 1947 when the tradition was recovered, a fact that occurred as a result, paradoxically, of a disgrace: the explosion of the San Severiano storage depot, who caused some 200 victims in the city. The civil governor, Carlos Mar√≠a Rodr√≠guez de Valc√°rcel, decided then that it was necessary to raise the spirits and was recovered the festive spirit In the organisation of the Carnival.\\"El carnaval de C√°diz prohibido durante la Guerra Civil\\" Musical groups The most famous groups are the chirigotas, the choirs, and the comparsas. The comparsas are well-known witty and satiric groups that train for the whole year to sing about politics, topics in the news, and everyday circumstances, while all of the members wear identical costumes. There is an official competition in Teatro Falla, where many of them compete for a group award. Their songs are all original compositions and are full of satire and wit. Each comparsa ‚Äì whether a professional group or one made up of family members, friends or colleagues ‚Äì has a wide repertoire of songs. They sing in the streets and squares, at improvised venues like outdoor staircases or portals, and in established open-air tablaos (tableaux) organized by the carnival clubs. The chirigotas are the groups of people (like the comparsas) that sharing a costume and singing together, performed a full repertoire of songs about current topics but with in a humoristic way, unlike the comparsas. The chirigotas¬¥ tunes are happier as well as their lyrics even though they can address the same subjects as the comparsas. They also compete in the Teatro Falla for the awards. The choirs (coros) are larger groups that travel through the streets on open flat-bed carts or wagons, singing, with a small ensemble of guitars and lutes. Their characteristic composition is the \\"Carnival Tango\\", and they alternate between comical and serious repertory, with special emphasis on lyrical homages to the city and its people. The costumes are, by far, the most sophisticated and elaborate of all. [ Other groups can be found in the streets: the quartets (cuartetos), that, oddly, can be composed of five, four, or three members. They do not bring a guitar, only a kazoo and two sticks, that they use to mark the rhythm. They use set-piece theater scenes (pre-written skits), improvisations, and music, and they are purely comical. The minimalist carnival groups in C√°diz are the romanceros, perhaps the oldest, and, certainly, the most invariant carnival representation in C√°diz throughout history. A romancero is a single costumed person who brings a big easel on which posters help him to tell a story with images. The romancero recites humorous verses while pointing at aspects of the pictures and drawings with a long stick. A choir singing at the Carnival of C√°diz Musical forms Specific musical forms have evolved at the Carnival of C√°diz over the years. In the beginning, popular music was used, and tropical rhythms were mixed with popular European dances and songs; only the lyrics changed. Near the end of the nineteenth century, the musical identity of the Carnival was already mature, and, although most of the names (tango, pasodoble, couplet, etc.) are shared with other musical forms around the world, their melodies, rhythms, and character are unmistakably original. *The Presentation is the first piece sung to present the characterisation of the group, called its tipo. The style of the music is absolutely free and unstructured. It can take the form of a well- known form, an original composition, or even a spoken-word recitation. *The Couplet is sung by the chirigotas, comparsas, choirs, and quartets. They are short satirical songs with a refrain that is always related to the costume and the characterisation (tipo) of the group. *The Pasodoble is a longer song without a refrain, and it is usually (but not always) serious, criticising something that happened during the previous year or rendering an homage to someone. They are sung by the comparsas and the chirigotas. Gran Teatro Falla, the venue for the main contest of chirigotas, choirs and comparsas during the twenty days before the Carnival. *The Tango, with its characteristic gaditano rhythm is sung only by the choirs, accompanied by their orchestras, and they are mostly poetical compositions. *The Potpourri, sung by all of the groups, changing the lyrics of well-known songs of the year or any other kind of music, sometimes depending on the group's tipo. Beside these, other musical forms, including short improvisations and theatrical skits are featured, mostly by the so-called illegal chirigotas, murgas, or callejeras, that don't submit to any rule or contest. They just roam the streets singing and performing as they wish. The contests The best known contest among chirigotas, choirs, comparsas, and quartets in C√°diz is the 'Official Contest' at the Gran Teatro Falla, that finishes just before the first Saturday of Carnival. It is broadcast by the regional television and radio stations. Other contests take place before, during, and after the Carnival, usually organized by institutions and private clubs, and their venues are open tablaos in the public squares (plazas) of the city.

The Academy is sponsored by National Educational Charity, E-ACT. In April 2014, the Academy was re-inspected as a new establishment, with Ofsted stating that the school 'Requires Improvement'. In December 2015 the school featured in local news for not testing pupils with dyslexia. Burnham Park was inspected by Ofsted again in July 2016, and overall graded 'Inadequate', leading to the school being placed in special measures. The report states that special needs pupils and disadvantaged pupils did not make good progress. The school was inspected again in March 2017, December 2017 and June 2018. The reports stated progress was being made towards coming out of special measures, but special needs pupils were not making strong progress and the recommendations of the external pupil premium report were still not being fully implemented. The school is however working towards resolving these issues as of the most recent inspection. the report in June 2018 states 5 teachers have left and the school is finding it difficult to recruit replacement teachers. In March 2019 the school was inspected again and found to be inadequate again. On the first day of the inspection 15 of the 20 teachers were sick or absent. The Secretary of State for education has now agreed for Burnham Park to close. Since the 2014 -2015 academic year, the school has received extra pupil premium funding to support teaching of English, Maths and Science to narrow the attainment gap. This funding was less successful in Science. In 2017 Ofsted requested external review of the effectiveness of pupil premium usage.http://www.e-actburnhampark.org.uk/docs/The_E- Act_Burnham_Park_Academy_Final_Report_25_04_17.pdf Pupil numbers are low.

His family's business in Lancaster produced oilcloth and linoleum, which was exported around the world. After serving as a Member of Parliament for Lancaster, he was elevated to the peerage as Baron Ashton in 1895. Unproven accusations that he had purchased his title, however, haunted him and led to his eventual withdrawal from public life.Williamson Park: history Early life Williamson was born the third of four surviving children to Alderman James Williamson and Eleanor (n√©e Miller) of Parkfield, Lancashire. His father, who was mayor of Lancaster, had established a successful coated fabrics business in the town in the 1840s. James was educated at Lancaster Royal Grammar School and worked all his life in the family business. Contributions to Lancaster The Ashton Memorial, which Lord Ashton built after the death of his second wife. The Williamson family was extremely wealthy and dedicated to charity. With his father, Williamson created the city's Williamson Park, on the site of former stone quarries on Lancaster moor, and built other gardens throughout the city. After the death of his second wife, Jessie, who supported him in his political life, he built the Ashton Memorial on a hill in the park in 1909. The Memorial, an Edwardian baroque building, is now used for exhibitions and for weddings. He also donated the city's Town Hall and a monument to Queen Victoria in the city's Dalton Square. Williamson bought Ashton Hall in 1884, serving as High Sheriff of Lancashire for 1885. Williamson was noted in particular for his generosity to children. After he became High Sheriff in 1885, he served a breakfast for 10,000 people of the local population. Williamson's philanthropy in Lancaster over the years, through many gifts, subscriptions, and buildings, amounted to more than ¬£500,000 (). Political career and peerage In the 1886 general election, Williamson was elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for Lancaster, and held his seat at the 1892 election. Williamson was a strong supporter of Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone, the Liberal Party leader, and Gladstone likewise held Williamson in high regard for his business instincts. Williamson was a supporter of Gladstone's Government of Ireland Bill 1893, and gave generously to Irish causes. Gladstone planned to recommend Williamson for a peerage but resigned in 1894, without any outgoing honours. The next year, though, Williamson was elevated to the peerage as Baron Ashton, of Ashton in the County Palatine of Lancaster, during the Prime Minister's Resignation Honours of Lord Rosebery. Williamson's peerage was one of two in Lord Rosebery's honours list that led to heavy criticism, including from the Duke of Devonshire, head of the Liberal Unionist Party, who insinuated that Williamson had bought his title. Lord Rosebery explained that the creation of the two peerages were a \\"point of honour\\" as they had been promised by Gladstone, and added that the idea they had been sold was \\"an infamous lie.\\" Williamson, now Lord Ashton, exclaimed that he had not \\"paid a farthing\\" for his title. Nevertheless, the accusations that Ashton had purchased his title continued, and he was subject to frequent criticism and derision in Lancaster, which led to his eventual withdrawal from public life. Prior to the January 1910 general election, Lord Ashton sent a letter to the electors in the Lancaster Division promising that there was no connection between his politics and philanthropy, but that if the charges continued against him, he would withdraw his support from Lancaster. He followed through with his threat the next year, after insulting incidents related to the 1911 municipal elections, and he cancelled all his significant charitable interest in the city. Lord Ashton's withdrawal as benefactor caused considerable dismay among the various causes he had supported in Lancaster. In response, the Lancaster Town Council passed a resolution \\"expressing gratitude to him for his benefactions to the town and detestation of the attacks to which he had been subject.\\" Lord Ashton was unmoved, however, and transferred his philanthropic efforts elsewhere, particularly to the East End of London. During the First World War, he backed the War Loan, with ¬£3,000,000 in cash (). He also continued to support the Liberal Party. In 1920, Lord Ashton was made Constable of Lancaster Castle for life. He was also Deputy Lieutenant of Lancashire and was elected as president of the Lancashire County Cricket Club in 1927. In later years, he became a virtual social recluse, although still running his business interests. He divided his time between Ashton Park and Ryelands House, his other home in Lancaster. Ryelands became packed with stacks of newspapers and magazines that reportedly reached the ceiling. When in London, he refused to stay at his townhouse, Alford House, instead staying at a hotel. He would not go to social events or pay social calls, and refused to see anyone who had not made an appointment to see him. He even refused to meet a journalist from South America who had traveled to interview him but had mistakenly not arranged the appointment in advance. Marriage and issue He married three times, firstly to Margaret Gatey in 1869, with whom he had two daughters: *The Hon. Eleanor \\"Ella\\" Williamson (6 June 1871 ‚Äì 9 November 1949), married Earl Peel in 1899. *The Hon. Maud Williamson (11 January 1876 ‚Äì 11 May 1906), died unmarried. His first wife died in 1877. He married secondly in 1880 to widow Jessy Henrietta Hulme (n√©e Stewart), who died in 1904. In 1909, he married thirdly to Florence Whalley (n√©e Daniel), widow of Colonel Joseph Lawson Whalley, who survived him. Lord Ashton died at Ashton Hall in 1930, aged 88. He left an estate worth ¬£9.5 million ().England & Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1858-1966, 1973-1995 Arms References  External links  * Category:1842 births Category:1930 deaths Category:People from Lancaster, Lancashire Category:English businesspeople Category:Liberal Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Ashton, James Williamson, 1st Baron Category:UK MPs 1886‚Äì1892 Category:UK MPs 1892‚Äì1895 Category:UK MPs who were granted peerages Category:Deputy Lieutenants of Lancashire Category:English justices of the peace Category:High Sheriffs of Lancashire ","title":"James Williamson, 1st Baron Ashton"},{"id":"7091290","text":"Burns Guitars London is an English manufacturer of electric guitars and bass guitars, founded by Alice Louise Farrell (1908‚Äì1993) and James Ormston (Jim) Burns (1925‚Äì1998) in 1959. The company was first named \\"Burns-Weill\\", then renamed \\"Ormston Burns Ltd\\". At its peak, in the 1960s, it was the most successful guitar company in England. Ormston Burns Ltd. was bought up by Baldwin Piano Company in 1965, and the company was renamed \\"Baldwin-Burns\\". Burns guitars were reintroduced in 1991 under the name \\"Burns London\\", and the product line now includes a collector's edition of the first model the company produced.  History  A 1962 Burns Vista Sonic, with the \\"Wild Dog\\" tone setting (missing original finish) Jim Burns set out to make, in his own words, \\"mass produced one-offs\\", such as the Marvin, a radical take on the Stratocaster style with many more differences than it is generally credited with The Bison, now considered as a classic, combined fewer Fender influences with a shorter scale length of 25 inches, and the \\"Wild Dog\\" electronics, allowing the high-output Tri-Sonic pickups to be selected in many different, and sometimes unusual, combinations. Burns had a proprietary vibrato system, which was used also on Gretsch guitars. Shortscale Jazz Guitar Detail of Shortscale Jazz Guitar The original guitars made many showbiz friends, and were seen in the hands of some high-profile performers of the time, such as Elvis Presley, Hank Marvin and Jimmy Page,Day, pp. 84‚Äì87 and were quite popular since they were much cheaper than US brands such as Fender and Gibson, helped also by import tariffs that made it expensive to buy US-made guitars in Britain. Jim Burns' first commercial foray into electric guitar making came in 1958 when he designed and built the \\"Ike Isaacs Short Scale Model\\" for the Supersound Company. The timing of the establishment of Burns London was perfect with the British guitar market experiencing a huge boom, in part thanks to the popularity of British pop bands like The Shadows, and again thanks to the high tariffs on US-made goods. The US brand Ampeg imported British-made Burns guitars for a short time prior to the Baldwin takeover. Apart from the pickguard badge ('Ampeg by Burns of London') these were exactly the same as their British counterparts.Day, p. 33 Burns manufactured guitar amplifiers as well; the Jimi Hendrix Experience acquired a few small 30-watt amps in 1966, but desired \\"big clout, you know, big amplifiers\\", according to Mitch Mitchell. Despite the good times for guitar sales, Ormston Burns Ltd. was sold in 1965 to the Baldwin Piano and Organ Company of Cincinnati for the price of $380,000, small money in comparison to the $13 million paid at the time for Fender (where Baldwin were outbid by CBS).Gj√∂rde, p. 35 The company was renamed Baldwin-Burns (latterly Baldwin) and released three amplifiers at the NAMM Show of June 1965. Collectors insist that the Baldwin-era instruments were somehow inferior to those produced before the takeover, but with the exception of some newly-introduced models, the quality standards on models like the Marvin, Jazz Guitar and Shadows bass remained consistent, with only minor cosmetic differences and the Baldwin badge to distinguish them from the Burns-branded era of production. For a short time, existing stock was rebadged (initially as 'Baldwin-Burns', then simply 'Baldwin') by the simple expedient of inserting a routed nameplate into the pickguard, from which the earlier Burns routing had been excised. This practise did not last long, and original Baldwin pickguards appeared shortly afterwards, identical to the Burns originals save for the Baldwin routing. Other commercially-driven changes included the replacement of the elaborate, carved scroll head (seen on earlier versions of the Marvin, Virginian and others) with a simpler design, and a standardised neck began to appear on most models around 1967, consisting of this 'flat' scroll head and a bound fingerboard. Towards the end of the 1960s, Baldwin took the decision to concentrate on the Gretsch range of guitars and drums which they had acquired in 1967, and the Baldwin guitar brand was wound down, with production coming to an end in 1970.Day, p. 36  Burns Guitars from 1970‚Äì1983  Burns Flyte, a popular glam rock guitar with Mach One Humbuster pickups While the original Burns guitar line ended in 1970, Jim Burns never quite stopped working on his creations. Several attempts were made to revive the Burns name, in between projects with entirely new companies. In 1966, Jim Burns, unable to use the Burns name, started a new company called Ormston, formed initially to market a range of pedal steel guitars made by Denley. In 1968, just before Ormston shut its doors also, Jim Burns created an original guitar which later became a prototype for the Hayman range, which came about after being hired by the Dallas-Arbiter Organisation to work on a new range of guitars under the name of Hayman. The line lasted from 1969 to 1973, and enjoyed a fair share of popularity. During the '70s, two more attempts were made at resurrecting the Burns guitar line. Again, due to the agreement with Baldwin, the Burns name could not be used, so the first attempt was named \\"Burns UK\\", and the second called \\"Jim Burns Actualizers Ltd.\\" Burns UK (1974-77) The 1977 release of the simpler LJ24 with new Mach Two pickups came too late to save Burns UK \\"Burns UK\\" appeared in 1974 and lasted until 1977. Burns UK guitars were manufactured close to Newcastle upon Tyne in Jim Burns' native north east. Only one guitar model sold well, The Flyte, which was originally to be named the Conchorde, after the supersonic plane, because of its shape. Its design proved popular among glam rock performers of the time, such as Slade and Marc Bolan.Gj√∂rde, p. 47 Despite their unconventional design (which often added to the production cost), the guitars had a rather conventional sound, and again Burns ceased to produce guitars‚Äîbut not before of few examples of the Burns Mirage, the successor to the Flyte, had been produced. Jim Burns Actualizers Ltd. (1979‚Äì1983) Jim Burns Actualizers Ltd. was established in 1979 at Littleport near Ely in Cambridgeshire, and lasted another four years, into 1983, and produced some more recognisably \\"Burns\\" guitars. These were the Steer, Scorpion, Magpie and Bandit. There was also the first attempt to recreate the Bison and Marvin in updated form. Gj√∂rde, pp. 50‚Äì54 The Burns Steer, a semi-acoustic altered to reduce feedback, was popularized by singer Billy Bragg. A variant of the Scorpion was produced for Chris Stein of Blondie in very small numbers.  Burns London Ltd.  After Jim Burns Ltd, no more Burns guitars appeared on the market until 1992, when the company was restarted by Barry Gibson, who employed Jim Burns as a consultant in the company.Gj√∂rde, p. 55 The original idea was to manufacture handmade replicas of famous Burns guitars from previous incarnations, such as the Marvin and the Nu-Sonic; Gaz Coombes of Supergrass played a reissue of the Bison. Later on, in 1999, the company began work on a budget line called the Club Series, outsourcing production to Korea. The Club Series became the first Burns guitars ever to be manufactured outside of Britain, but the original Burns design ethics, construction and style didn't suffer as a result, with the range exploding in popularity throughout the following years. The Club Series expanded quickly, many Jim Burns-designed guitars constructed from 1960 to 1983 receiving its own budget model, such as the Marquee which was a budget version of The Marvin, the Steer (most famously played by Billy Bragg, the London Steer being a copy of a Steer guitar built and given to Billy by Jim Burns many years ago), the Bison and even the Barracuda six-string bass/baritone model. Newer designs have begun to emerge in the last few years, usually building upon the designs of the '60s originals, such as the Batwing, a Marquee with a Bison-style headstock. Burns also worked with Queen guitarist Brian May to produce a copy of May's Red Special guitar (which uses Burns Tri-Sonic pickups), and this model was awarded \\"Best Electric Guitar of the Year 2001\\" by Guitarist magazine.Gj√∂rde, pp. 62‚Äì63 An even cheaper range (manufactured in China) has emerged with two new models, the Cobra and the Nu-Sonic. The Cobra is the closest Burns have come to a straight copy in its lifetime. The body is that of a Stratocaster, but the model retains the sectioned pickguard, Tri-Sonic pickups and (shrunken) batwing headstock common to other Burns guitars. Meanwhile, the Nu- Sonic borrows the name of an original Burns guitar, and resembles more the Fender Telecaster, albeit with a distinctly different pickup setup with two Tri-Sonics and a bridge humbucker borrowing directly from the Steer. As well as the pickups, it also retains the shrunken batwing headstock of its cousin, as well as a German carve around the front edge of the guitar.

Early career He was born in Sidehead, Weredale, County Durham, England in 1787, studied in London and came to Lower Canada in 1801. After further studies at Sorel, he joined John Ogilvy's firm, part of the XY Company. He later joined McTavish, McGillivray and Company, part of the North West Company. Gillespie, Moffatt, and Company In 1811, he became a partner in a new firm, which eventually became Gillespie, Moffatt, and Company, a major supply house associated with the North West Company. He served in the Montreal militia during the War of 1812. In 1815 and 1816, he helped Colin Robertson during his expeditions to the Athabaska country. Moffatt helped bring stability to the fur trade in Canada by helping to smooth the way for the merger of the North West Company and the Hudson's Bay Company in 1821. In the meantime, his company had expanded into a wider range of imports and exports, owning its own ship and opening a branch office in Toronto. The company was also Canadian agents for the Phoenix Fire Assurance Company. Political career Moffatt served as a director of the Bank of Montreal from 1822 to 1835 and he was also involved in the development of railroads. In 1830, he was named to the Legislative Council of Lower Canada, serving until 1838. Following the Lower Canada Rebellion, Moffatt recommended moderation in dealing with the rebels and supported a union with Upper Canada. He was named to the special council that governed the province after the rebellion. In 1841, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada as one of two members for the city of Montreal as a Conservative member; he resigned in 1843 to protest the movement of the capital from Kingston to Montreal but was reelected in 1844. Although initially opposing the use of French in the assembly, he later supported a motion by Denis-Benjamin Papineau to reinstate the use of French as an official language in parliament. Moffatt helped develop the harbour facilities at Montreal, serving as chairman of the harbour commission and was also president of the Montreal Board of Trade from 1844 to 1846. He was chairman of the short-lived British American League at Montreal, which developed in response to the annexation movement in Canada East. Death Moffatt died in Montreal in 1865.

It is situated on a creek of the River Yealm estuary, about south-east of the City of Plymouth. It lies within the South Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. According to the United Kingdom Census 2011 the population of the village of Newton Ferrers was 1,268 and that of the electoral ward of Newton and Noss was 1,814. History The manor of Newton Ferrers is listed in the 1086 Domesday Book as Niwetone. It was granted to a branch of the Norman family of de Ferrers, after which the manor and village became known as Newton Ferrers. It was probably the birthplace of the notorious 17th-century pirate Henry Every. Churches Holy Cross Church, Newton Ferrers, the parish church, was re-built in 1260. It was less than half the size of the present building and in 1342 was enlarged by the then rector, Henry de Ferrers. It received a Victorian restoration by George Fellowes Prynne in 1885‚Äì6 and only the west tower and the north and south arcades remain of the medieval structure. Across the creek in the former parish of Noss Mayo St Peter's Church was built in 1880‚Äì82 by Edward Baring, 1st Baron Revelstoke of Membland, and took over from the nearby Church of St Peter the Poor Fisherman, Revelstoke, built in 1226. All three churches were ministered by Rev. Jonathan Cruickshank. Amenities The village's shops are on Newton Hill: there is a co-op; a Post Office selling fruit, veg, magazines and clothes; a pharmacy; a butcher who also sells cold meat and cheese; and an estate agent. There are no shops in Noss Mayo, but it has two public houses, The Swan and The Ship. Newton Ferrers has one pub, The Dolphin, and all three are on the waterfront. During the summer a river taxi takes passengers around the two villages and makes regular trips between Newton Ferrers Harbour, Warren Point (for access to Wembury and its beach) and Noss Mayo. The art deco house Casa del Rio was built in 1936. Vosses Noss Voss at low tide At low tide there appear two \\"vosses\\", i.e. ancient solid man-made pathways across the estuary mud usable as crossing points. The Newton Voss crosses the Newton Creek between Riverside Road West below the Dolphin Inn to near the Swan Inn. The Noss Voss crosses the brook between the Swan Inn and the Ship Inn in Noss Mayo. Lifeboat station The Royal National Lifeboat Institution established a lifeboat station at the mouth of the Newton Creek in March 1878. A stone boat house was built and the boat was launched into the River Yealm using a slipway. The station was closed in 1927 by which time Plymouth Lifeboat Station had been equipped with a motor lifeboat which could cover the area more effectively. During its 49 years three different lifeboats operated from the 'Yealm River Lifeboat Station': Bowman (1878), Darling (1887) and Michael Smart (1904).

Water-fuelled cars have been the subject of numerous international patents, newspaper and popular science magazine articles, local television news coverage, and websites. The claims for these devices have been found to be pseudoscience and some were found to be tied to investment frauds.State of New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety press release, November 9, 2006 These vehicles may be claimed to produce fuel from water on board with no other energy input, or may be a hybrid claiming to derive some of its energy from water in addition to a conventional source (such as gasoline). Water is fully oxidized hydrogen. Hydrogen itself is a high-energy, flammable substance, but its useful energy is released when water is formed. Water will not burn. The process of electrolysis can split water into hydrogen and oxygen, but it takes as much energy to take apart a water molecule as was released when the hydrogen was oxidized to form water. In fact, some energy would be lost in converting water to hydrogen and then burning the hydrogen because some waste heat would always be produced in the conversions. Releasing chemical energy from water, in excess or in equal proportion to the energy required to facilitate such production, would therefore violate the first or second law of thermodynamics. Professor doubts water car claims ‚Äì A leading alternative fuels expert throws water on Japanese company claims that it's developed the world's first car powered by just water. Professor Theodosios Korakianitis at Queen Mary University of London says water by itself would not be enough to get your car going. Guidelines for Use of Hydrogen Fuel in Commercial Vehicles. Final Report , U.S. Department of Transportation. Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, November 2007, pp. 20-21 What water- fuelled cars are not A water-fuelled car is not any of the following: * Water injection which is a method for cooling the combustion chambers of engines by adding water to the incoming fuel-air mixture, allowing for greater compression ratios and reduced engine knocking (detonation). * The hydrogen car, although it often incorporates some of the same elements. To fuel a hydrogen car from water, electricity is used to generate hydrogen by electrolysis. The resulting hydrogen is an energy carrier that can power a car by reacting with oxygen from the air to create water, either through burning in a combustion engine or catalyzed to produce electricity in a fuel cell. * Hydrogen fuel enhancement, where a mixture of hydrogen and conventional hydrocarbon fuel is burned in an internal combustion engine, usually in an attempt to improve fuel economy or reduce emissions. Extracting energy from water According to the currently accepted laws of physics, there is no way to extract chemical energy from water alone. Water itself is highly stable‚Äîit was one of the classical elements and contains very strong chemical bonds. Its enthalpy of formation is negative (-68.3 kcal/mol or -285.8 kJ/mol), meaning that energy is required to break those stable bonds, to separate water into its elements, and there are no other compounds of hydrogen and oxygen with more negative enthalpies of formation, meaning that no energy can be released in this manner either. Most proposed water-fuelled cars rely on some form of electrolysis to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen and then recombine them to release energy; however, because the energy required to separate the elements will always be at least as great as the useful energy released, this cannot be used to produce net energy. Claims of functioning water-fuelled cars Garrett electrolytic carburetor Charles H. Garrett allegedly demonstrated a water-fuelled car \\"for several minutes\\", which was reported on September 8, 1935, in The Dallas Morning News. The car generated hydrogen by electrolysis as can be seen by examining Garrett's patent, issued that same year. Electrolytic carburetor ‚Äì Charles H. Garrett This patent includes drawings which show a carburetor similar to an ordinary float-type carburetor but with electrolysis plates in the lower portion, and where the float is used to maintain the level of the water. Garrett's patent fails to identify a new source of energy. Stanley Meyer's water fuel cell Stanley Meyer's water fuel cell Method for the production of a fuel gas ‚Äì Stanley A. Meyer At least as far back as 1980, Stanley Meyer claimed that he had built a dune buggy that ran on water, although he gave inconsistent explanations as to its mode of operation. In some cases, he claimed that he had replaced the spark plugs with a \\"water splitter\\", while in other cases it was claimed to rely on a \\"fuel cell\\" that split the water into hydrogen and oxygen. The \\"fuel cell\\", which he claimed was subjected to an electrical resonance, would split the water mist into hydrogen and oxygen gas, which would then be combusted back into water vapour in a conventional internal combustion engine to produce net energy. Meyer's claims were never independently verified, and in an Ohio court in 1996 he was found guilty of \\"gross and egregious fraud\\". He died of an aneurysm in 1998, although conspiracy theories claim that he was poisoned. Dennis Klein In 2002, the firm Hydrogen Technology Applications patented an electrolyser design and trademarked the term \\"Aquygen\\" to refer to the hydrogen oxygen gas mixture produced by the device.Business Wire Hydrogen Technology Applications and UTEK Corporation Announce Strategic Alliance Agreement (April 2002)EVWORLD FEATURE: Electric Cars and the Goldilocks Planet: Global Warming Carbon Dioxide Cold FusionKnight-Ridder/Tribune Business News: Clearwater man puts technology to work Tampa Tribune (Tampa, Florida) (November 2005) Originally developed as an alternative to oxyacetylene welding, the company claimed to be able to run a vehicle exclusively on water, via the production of \\"Aquygen\\", and invoked an unproven state of matter called \\"magnegases\\" and a discredited theory about magnecules to explain their results. Company founder Dennis Klein claimed to be in negotiations with a major US auto manufacturer and that the US government wanted to produce Hummers that used his technology. At present, the company no longer claims it can run a car exclusively on water, and is instead marketing \\"Aquygen\\" production as a technique to increase fuel efficiency, thus making it Hydrogen fuel enhancement rather than a water-fuelled car. Genesis World Energy (GWE) Also in 2002, Genesis World Energy announced a market ready device which would extract energy from water by separating the hydrogen and oxygen and then recombining them. In 2003, the company announced that this technology had been adapted to power automobiles. The company collected over $2.5 million from investors, but none of their devices were ever brought to market. In 2006, Patrick Kelly, the owner of Genesis World Energy was sentenced in New Jersey to five years in prison for theft and ordered to pay $400,000 in restitution. Genepax Water Energy System In June 2008, Japanese company Genepax unveiled a car it claimed ran on only water and air, and many news outlets dubbed the vehicle a \\"water-fuel car\\". The company said it \\"cannot [reveal] the core part of this invention\\" yet, but it disclosed that the system used an onboard energy generator, which it called a \\"membrane electrode assembly\\", to extract the hydrogen using a \\"mechanism which is similar to the method in which hydrogen is produced by a reaction of metal hydride and water\\". The hydrogen was then used to generate energy to run the car. This led to speculation that the metal hydride is consumed in the process and is the ultimate source of the car's energy, making it a hydride-fuelled \\"hydrogen on demand\\" vehicle rather than water-fuelled as claimed. On the company's website the energy source is explained only with the words \\"Chemical reaction\\". The science and technology magazine Popular Mechanics described Genepax's claims as \\"rubbish\\". The vehicle Genepax demonstrated to the press in 2008 was a REVAi electric car, which was manufactured in India and sold in the UK as the G-Wiz. In early 2009, Genepax announced they were closing their website, citing large development costs. Thushara Priyamal Edirisinghe Also in 2008, Sri Lankan news sources reported that Thushara Priyamal Edirisinghe claimed to drive a water-fuelled car about .The news sources said he travelled from Pannipitiya, Thushara, to Anuradhapura and back. on of water.Business Intelligence Middle East:The water-powered car race heats up still furtherDailynews Sri Lanka: In search of creativity Like other alleged water-fuelled cars described above, energy for the car was supposedly produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using electrolysis, and then burning the gases in the engine. Thushara showed the technology to Prime Minister Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka, who \\"extended the Government‚Äôs full support to his efforts to introduce the water-powered car to the Sri Lankan market\\". Thushara was arrested a few months later on suspicion of investment fraud. Daniel Dingel Daniel Dingel, a Filipino inventor, has been claiming since 1969 to have developed technology allowing water to be used as fuel. In 2000, Dingel entered into a business partnership with Formosa Plastics Group to further develop the technology. In 2008, Formosa Plastics successfully sued Dingel for fraud and Dingel, who was 82, was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment. Dr Ghulam Sarwar In December 2011, Pakistani doctor Ghulam Sarwar claimed he had invented a car that ran only on water.New Water Running Car Kit Launched by Dr Ghulam Sarwar Launch, The News Pakistan At the time the invented car was claimed to use 60% water and 40% Diesel or fuel, but that the inventor was working to make it run on only water, probably by end of June 2012. It was further claimed the car \\"emits only oxygen rather than the usual carbon\\". Agha Waqar Ahmad Pakistani man Agha Waqar Ahmad claimed in July 2012 to have invented a water-fuelled car by installing a \\"water kit\\" for all kind of automobiles, which consists of a cylindrical jar that holds the water, a bubbler, and a pipe leading to the engine. He claimed the kit used electrolysis to convert water into \\"HHO\\", which is then used as fuel. The kit required use of distilled water to work. Ahmed claimed he has been able to generate more oxyhydrogen than any other inventor because of \\"undisclosed calculations\\". He applied for a patent in Pakistan. Some Pakistani scientists said Agha's invention was a fraud that violates the laws of thermodynamics. Hydrogen as a supplement In addition to claims of cars that run exclusively on water, there have also been claims that burning hydrogen or oxyhydrogen together with petrol or diesel increases mileage and efficiency; these claims are debated.newsreview: Hydrogen generators get a test drive in the search for fuel economy and lower emissions By Scott D.F. Reeves A number of websites promote the use of oxyhydrogen, also called \\"HHO\\", selling plans for do-it-yourself electrolysers or kits with the promise of large improvements in fuel efficiency. According to a spokesman for the American Automobile Association, \\"All of these devices look like they could probably work for you, but let me tell you they don't\\". Gasoline pill and related additives Related to the water-fuelled car hoax are claims that additives, often a pill, can convert the water into usable fuel, similar to a carbide lamp, in which a high-energy additive produces the combustible fuel. These claims are all false, and often with fraudulent intent, as again water itself cannot contribute any energy to the process. Hydrogen on demand technologies A hydrogen on demand vehicle uses a chemical reaction to produce hydrogen from water. The hydrogen is then burned in an internal combustion engine or used in a fuel cell to generate electricity which powers the vehicle. These designs take energy from the chemical that reacts with water; vehicles of this type are not precluded by the laws of nature. Aluminium, magnesium, and sodium borohydride react with water to generate hydrogen and have been used in hydrogen on demand prototypes. Eventually, the chemical runs out and has to be replenished. The energy required to produce such compounds exceeds the energy obtained from their reaction with water. \\"Forget cars fuelled by alcohol and vegetable oil. Before long, you might be able to run your car with nothing more than water in its fuel tank. It would be the ultimate zero-emissions vehicle.\\" One example of a hydrogen on demand device, created by scientists from the University of Minnesota and the Weizmann Institute of Science, uses boron to generate hydrogen from water. An article in New Scientist in July 2006 described the power source under the headline \\"A fuel tank full of water,\\" and they quote Abu-Hamed as saying: A vehicle powered by the device would take on water and boron instead of petrol, and generate boron trioxide. Elemental boron is difficult to prepare and does not occur naturally. Boron trioxide is an example of a borate, which is the predominant form of boron on earth. Thus, a boron-powered vehicle would require an economical method of preparing elemental boron. The chemical reactions describing the oxidation of boron are: :4B + 6H2O ‚Üí 2B2O3 \\\\+ 6H2 [Hydrogen Generation Step] :6H2 \\\\+ 3O2 ‚Üí 6H2O [Combustion step] The balanced chemical equation representing the overall process (hydrogen generation and combustion) is: :4B + 3O2 ‚Üí 2 B2O3 As shown above, boron trioxide is the only net byproduct, and it could be removed from the car and turned back into boron and reused. Electricity input is required to complete this process, which Al- Hamed suggests could come from solar panels. Although it is possible to obtain elemental boron by electrolysis, a substantial expenditure of energy is required. The process of converting borates to elemental boron and back might be compared with the analogous process involving carbon: carbon dioxide could be converted to charcoal (elemental carbon), then burnt to produce carbon dioxide. In popular culture It is referred to in the pilot episode for the That '70s Show sitcom, as well as in the twenty-first episode of the fifth season and the series finale. \\"Gashole\\" (2010), a documentary film about the history of oil prices and the future of alternative mentions multiple stories regarding engines that use water to increase mileage efficiency. \\"Like Water for Octane,\\" an episode of The Lone Gunmen,\\"The Lone Gunmen ‚Äì Plot Summary.\\" _IMDb_. 2007.

He is known for winning the first Daily Mail aviation prize for the first flight between London and Manchester in 1910. Biography Paulhan was born at P√©zenas, H√©rault, and his heavier-than-air flying career began with making model aircraft. Stationed at St Cyr as a balloon pilot during his military service, in 1905 he won a competition for model aircraft design. Following his national service, he was employed by the balloon manufacturer √âdouard Surcouf as an engineer, working on the construction of the dirigible La Ville de Paris and making many flights as its mechanic during 1907. The same year he won a competition for model aircraft design in which the first prize was to be a full-size construction of the winning design. His design was so complex that instead he was given a Voisin airframe. With the help of family and friends, he obtained an engine and taught himself to fly in 1909. He was issued with French pilot licence No.10. (The first batch of 10 licences was issued in alphabetical order of surname.) He quickly established himself as gifted pilot. He took part in many airshows, including one in La Brayelle Airfield, Douai, in July 1909, where he set new records for altitude () and duration (1h 07m), covering , and the Grande Semaine d'Aviation in Rheims where he crashed. In Lyon, flying a Farman III, he broke three records: height (920 m), speed (20 km in 19 minutes) and weight, carrying a passenger. He flew at the Blackpool Aviation Week in October 1909, Britain's first air show. On 29 October 1909, Paulhan made the first official powered flight at Brooklands, Surrey, England, in his biplane made by Farman Aviation Works. This was also the first public flying display at Brooklands and some 20,000 spectators watched him fly to a height of . Local press reported that the land surrounded by the Brooklands Motor Racing Track was converted into an aerodrome for this event by a gang of men working day and night. Touring America Louis Paulhan at takeoff in a Farman III biplane at the 1910 Los Angeles International Air Meet at Dominguez Field. In January 1910, Paulhan was invited to America to take part in airshows and competitions, at the Los Angeles International Air Meet. He arrived with two Bl√©riot monoplanes and two Farman biplanes. The Wright brothers, though not taking part in the event, were there with their lawyers to prevent Paulhan and Glenn Curtiss from flying. The Wrights claimed that the ailerons on their aircraft infringed patents. Paulhan flew anyway, winning all of the prizes and $19,000. He set up a new altitude record of , beating his own previous record of , and won the endurance prize with a flight lasting 1hr 49mn 40sec. He gave William Randolph Hearst his first experience of flight. However, he seems to have let down William Boeing, who had been enthused by the new invention of the aeroplane: Paulhan and passenger Mrs. Dick Ferris at the Los Angeles Air Meet > While attending the first American Air Meet in Los Angeles, Boeing asked > nearly every aviator for a ride, but no one said yes except Paulhan. For > three days Boeing waited, but on the fourth day he discovered Paulhan had > already left the meet. Possibly, one of the biggest missed opportunities in > Paulhan's life was the ride he never gave Boeing. From Los Angeles, Paulhan moved on to give exhibitions in Salt Lake City, Utah, where the Deseret News headline announced that the \\"Air King is Here to Fly\\". He also appeared in New Orleans and made the first aeroplane flight in Texas. The Wright brothers' case led, on 17 February, to a Federal judge ordering Paulhan to pay $25,000 for every paid display. Furious, he cancelled his American tour and went to New York City to challenge the Wright brothers by giving public demonstration flights for free. The dispute rumbled on and in March an agreement was reached whereby he could continue to give flying exhibitions in his Farman biplane on condition that he pay a $6,000 a week bond, pending the outcome of the case. The affair threatened the planned international aviation meet to be hosted by the Aero Club of America, at which the competition for the Gordon Bennett Trophy was to be held. According to Courtlandt Field Bishop, president of the Aero Club of America, all the leading foreign aviators had assured him that they would not appear in the country until the case was decided. If Paulhan won, they would compete; if he lost they did \\"not care to place themselves within the jurisdiction of American courts.\\" Paulhan eventually left quietly for France. The Wrights' patent case dragged on for many more years, involving Curtiss and many other pilots and manufacturers. Back in Europe Returning to Europe, Paulhan continued his flying exploits. In April 1910, he won the London to Manchester air race, taking the ¬£10,000 prize offered for flying from London to Manchester, a distance of . This prize had been offered in 1906 by the Daily Mail for the first pilot to fly from London to Manchester within 24 hours. The flight had to start and finish within five miles of the Daily Mail office in each city, with no more than two landings en route. In 1906 this seemed an impossible feat ‚Äì the best European fliers at that time could only stay aloft for seconds. Paulhan arrived in Manchester 12 hours after setting out from London, having spent 4 hours 12 minutes in the air, with an overnight stop at Lichfield, 117 miles from his starting point. He thus beat the British contender, Claude Grahame-White. There is a blue plaque on a house in Paulhan Road, Burnage, Manchester, at the site of his winning landing.Chris Paul: Labour of Love: Burnage, Manchester: Claims to Fame In 1910 Paulhan was one of the first pilots to fly a seaplane, the Hydravion designed by Henri Fabre, and won a ¬£10,000 prize for the most flights made in the year. He also turned his attention to aircraft design, producing the Paulhan biplane in association with Fabre, a large triplane which was flown at the 1911 French military aircraft trials competition, and the A√©ro-Torpille in association with Victor Tatin. In February 1912, he opened a seaplane flying school in Villefranche- sur-Mer before moving to Arcachon . First World War In the First World War, Paulhan was mobilised as a pilot with the rank of lieutenant on 15 September 1914, serving initially in northern France near to Amiens. He was transferred to the Serbian front in 1915,L'homme-vent, special issue of L'Ami de P√©zenas, 2010, ISSN 1240-0084. where he was not only the most experienced but also the oldest aviator. In Serbia, he commanded a squadron of 10 Maurice Farman aeroplanes. In flight he was sometimes accompanied by a machine gunner or, it seems, by a mechanic carrying out repairs in flight. The Serbian campaign was unsuccessful, but Paulhan is credited with the world's first \\"medevac\\" when he flew the seriously ill Milan Stefanik to safety. Decorated with the croix de guerre, he returned to France and flew no more missions, but returned to construction, notably of propellors, for the French military. After the war, he was made an Officer of the L√©gion d'honneur. After 1918 Paulhan's monument in P√©zenas Plaque to Paulhan in Rue Conti, P√©zenas. On demobilisation, Paulhan became a seaplane builder, building machines under licence from Curtiss. He worked at aircraft construction with engineer Pillard at the Soci√©t√© Proven√ßale de Constructions A√©ronautiques, building in 1928 the first all-metal seaplane in France, the SPCA Paulhan-Pillard T3. He left the work the day when his only son, Ren√©, died on 10 May 1937, at the presentation of a fighter plane. He contributed to the manufacture of Dewoitine planes, but retired to Saint-Jean-de-Luz, which he rarely left before his death. In 1960, Paulhan was invited by Air France to be one of the passengers on its inaugural non-stop flight from Paris to Los Angeles. In 1927, Paulhan was a co-founder of the company Soci√©t√© Continentale Parker in France together with Robert Det√©, Enea Bossi and Pierre Prier. The purpose was to transfer surface treatment technologies for the growing aerospace industry to Europe. They started with a licence from Parker Rust-Proof of Detroit (Parkerizing or phosphating) and in a later step with the distribution rights of Udylite Corp for specialty chemicals in electroplating. The company's successor organizations, Chemetall GmbH and Coventya GmbH, later became the European market leaders in surface treatment. Paulhan died on 10 February 1963 at Saint-Jean-de-Luz. He is buried in his home town of P√©zenas where a monument has been erected in commemoration; a wall plaque in Rue Conti in P√©zenas also recalls his achievements.

It is owned and run by Belfast City Council and is one of the largest and busiest parks in the city and contains a variety of horticulture, woodland, wildlife and sporting facilities. The park is open daily from dawn to dusk. It features basketball, netball, football and tennis facilities, bowling greens, pavilions, car parking, cycling (and BMX track), ecotrails, horticultural displays, an orienteering course, a playground, seasonal bedding, specimen trees, and multiple walks. The park opens on to the Ormeau Road, the Ormeau Embankment, Park Road, and the Ravenhill Road. Access to Belfast city centre is available on Metro bus routes 7A - 7D. History The land for Ormeau Park was formerly part of the Donegall family estate. It became their home in 1807, when the family moved to Ormeau Cottage from their town house in Donegall Place. The building was extended by George Chichester, 2nd Marquess of Donegall, who lived there until his death in 1844. Eventually the family was forced to sell the estate to pay its spiralling debt. In 1869, the area was purchased by Belfast Corporation and it was opened as a park to the public in 1871. The opening of Belfast's first public park was marked with a parade from Carlisle Circus through Belfast which attracted a large crowd and finished with speeches in the park. The name Ormeau is probably derived from the French family name Ormeau which was a name for a person who lived near an elm tree, having derived its origin from the French word orme, meaning elm tree. This would suggest that there were many elm trees in the surrounding grounds. The surname Ormeau was first found in the Forez region of central France. The park was designed by Timothy Hevey, a successful young architect of the day. He won a competition for the best design for of parkland. The present-day park still roughly follows his design with several alterations. Some of the land is home to the 9-hole course of Ormeau Golf Club, and other nearby land near Ravenhill was laid out in playing fields. The embankment road cut off the river frontage of the park in the 1920s. The park has been used for Orange gatherings on the Twelfth as well as other open-air events such as revival meetings. It was also the scene of the first meeting of the Ulster Vanguard on 18 March 1972 when William Craig called on his followers to attend following his decision to leave the Ulster Unionist Party. Joined by 100,000 followers Craig made a controversial speech in which he stated that \\"we must build up a dossier of the men and women who are a menace to this country because if and when the politicians fail us, it may be our job to liquidate the enemy\\".P. Taylor, Loyalists, London: Bloomsbury, 2000, p. 96 In September 1973 the park was scene of a notably grisly murder in which ten-year-old abductee Brian McDermott was dismembered and his body incinerated. The gruesome nature of the murder was such that local press speculated it may have been carried out as part of a Satanic ritual.Martin Dillon, The Trigger Men, Mainstream Publishing, 2003, p. 104 However, according to British military intelligence and police files the killing had actually been carried out by John McKeague, a noted far right loyalist paramilitary and activist who was a leading figure in the paedophile ring at Kincora Boys' Home.Martin Dillon, The Shankill Butchers, (1989), p. 23 Stadium plan Along with the old Maysfield Leisure Centre site, the Ormeau Park site was one of two sites that emerged as alternatives to the Maze as a site for a new Northern Ireland stadium. A consortium advocating Ormeau Park as the best venue completed a feasibility study. The proposed City of Belfast Stadium would initially have accommodated a capacity of 25,000 seats with the option to extend to 35,000 seats as required. The plans said that the site would not occupy any of the park land used by the local community but that it would occupy the site currently housing the Ozone leisure facility. In 2007 the then First Minister Ian Paisley vetoed use of the Ormeau Park for this purpose and the plan was abandoned.Paisley says no to Ormeau stadium Culture The park hosted the Tennents ViTal festival for the first time in August 2007.
