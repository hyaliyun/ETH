Produced in 1884 by MacLure, MacDonald & Co. MacLure, MacDonald & Co. were, in Victorian times, \\"Ornamental Printers to the Queen\\". They invented a power-driven lithographic printing press in 1853. They engraved and produced stamps for Uruguay (1866), Sarawak (1869 and 1875) and telephone stamps for Great Britain (1884). Next to stamps they produced prints. The company was founded in 1835 and was acquired in 1992 by J R Reid Printers of Blantyre, South Lanarkshire. History Andrew MacLure and Archibald Gray MacDonald set up business as engravers and lithographic printers in Glasgow in 1835. Their first premises were in Trongate but by 1851 they had moved to 57 Buchanan Street, and later relocated to a 5-storey purpose-built facility in Bothwell Street. The firm also opened offices in Liverpool (1840), London (1845) and Manchester (1886). In 1851, MacLure, MacDonald & Co imported a Sigl machine from Germany which was capable of printing 600 sheets an hour and the firm is believed to be the first in the UK to use steam power for lithographic printing.

Biography  Manolova was born on 4 May 1965 in Kyustendil. She attended Moscow University and later the Bulgarian University of National and World Economy, graduating with several master's degrees in History (1988), Economics (1994) and Law (1998), as well as completing a specialty program in social management. Manolova was a registered attorney in her home town of Kyustendil from 1998 to 2015.  Political career  = Member and Deputy Chairperson of the National Assembly = She became a member of Bulgaria's National Assembly representing the Bulgarian Socialist Party in August 2005, taking part in numerous parliamentary commissions. In 2008, she took control of the Socialist Party's Kyustendil branch. Following the 2013 Bulgarian parliamentary election, she was elected as Deputy Speaker of Bulgaria's national assembly. She lost that position after her party's exit from government following the 2014 Bulgarian parliamentary election, but was re–µlected as a member of the National Assembly for another term. = Ombudsman = Manolova was appointed as Ombudsman of Bulgaria by the National Assembly on 20 October 2015. Even though the ruling GERB party, her socialist party's largest rival, initially rejected her candidacy, it eventually voted in its favour after all of the other parliamentary groups in the national assembly announced their support for it. She left the Socialist Party in order to take up her new position, as Bulgarian law doesn't allow the ombudsman to be a member of a political party. Manolova was extremely active during her tenure as Ombudsman, helping push through several landmark laws as she positioned herself as a \\"defender of the little people\\", which made her very popular among the Bulgarian public. By early 2019, she was one of the only two Bulgarian politicians (the other being President Rumen Radev) with an approval rating above 50%. She resigned as Ombudsman in early September 2019, citing \\"systematic neglect of the ombudsman institution\\" and a \\"lack of political will\\" by the National Assembly, as well as her intention to run for Mayor of Sofia, Bulgaria's capital and largest city. = Candidate for Mayor of Sofia = After resigning as Ombudsman, she entered into the race for Mayor of Sofia in the 2019 Bulgarian local elections as an independent candidate without a formal affiliation to a political party. Nevertheless, the Sofia branch of the Bulgarian Socialist Party decided to support and formally endorse her candidacy several days later on 11 September. Her candidacy was deemed as the first serious left-wing challenge for the position of Mayor of Sofia since the end of the socialist period, as following the end of that period Sofia was typically seen as a very safe election for GERB and a stronghold of centre-right and right-wing politics. Following the first round of the election Manolova secured a runoff round, in which she faced longstanding Mayor of Sofia Yordanka Fandakova from Bulgaria's ruling GERB party. Although her opponent Fandakova failed to secure a majority of votes even on the second round of the election, she was nevertheless elected as Mayor of Sofia, as she managed a lead over Manolova by about 4% of the vote. Manolova expressed doubts as to the fairness of the election, expressing the opinion that \\"the entirety of the Bulgarian underground had been mobilized\\" to swing the election in favour of her opponent. A week after the vote, Manolova officially filed a motion before the Bulgarian judiciary for the election in Sofia to be annulled and rerun, presenting 14 folders of what she dubbed as evidence of \\"heavy violations\\" of Bulgaria's electoral code and law, which she deemed had undermined the fairness of the election and skewed its result. In addition, she filed another civil lawsuit for 15,000 Bulgarian lev against Bulgarian Prime Minister and GERB leader Boyko Borisov personally. She accused Borisov of \\"false\\" and \\"defamatory\\" comments due to a statement he made in a television interview in the run-up to the second round of the election, in which he accused her of illegally buying votes from Romani in one of Sofia's districts. She pledged that if granted, she would donate all of the proceeds to fund the construction of a children's playground in that district. = Political project = In late 2019, following Sofia's Mayoral election, Manolova launched a political project dubbed Stand Up.BG, which she stated would not become a political party or affiliate itself to such, but would leverage political demands against Bulgaria's government. She stated that she would not run for leadership of Bulgaria's Socialist Party, nor for President of Bulgaria, and would instead dedicate her work to her new project. She described the project as a \\"civic platform\\" on a national scale, which would aim to coordinate actions of individual citizens and NGOs to \\"fight against monopolies and overconstruction and for living wages, a fair business environment, the lessing of the administrative burden on citizens and the securing of fair elections\\".  Personal life  Manolova was married to Milen Manolov, a customs officer from her home town. She had one daughter from this marriage. She divorced him in 2007. She married Angel Naidenov, a politician from the Socialist Party, on 2 October 2016. Manolova speaks English and Russian in addition to her native Bulgarian.

Biography Bullen was the second son of the Reverend John Bullen, Rector of Kennett, Cambridge, and of Rushmoor-cum- Newburn, Suffolk, and entered the Navy in November 1774 as a midshipman, on board the 36-gun frigate , commanded by Captain The Honourable William Cornwallis. He followed Cornwallis into the 50-gun ship , and was present at the Battle of Red Bank and siege of Fort Mifflin, in October and November 1777. Under Cornwallis he then served in the 50-gun ships , and , and 64-gun ship , in which he took part in the Battle of Grenada on 6 July 1779. Bullen was promoted to lieutenant on 6 March 1778, and shortly afterwards joined the 28-gun , commanded by Captain Horatio Nelson, and was present during the attack on Fort St. Juan during the San Juan Expedition of 1780. He then returned to the Lion, under Cornwallis, and was lent to the 90-gun ship , Captain John Williams, and participated as officer in charge of half the middle gun-deck in the Battle of the Saintes on 12 April 1782.* His subsequent appointments were to the on 2 May 1785, and then the on 6 July 1786, both 74's stationed as guardships at Plymouth, commanded by Captain Anthony Molloy. On 16 June 1790, he moved to the , under Captain Peter Rainier, fitting out at Spithead for the East Indies.

On 11 September 1793 he moved to the , flagship of Lord Hood at the siege of Toulon. For three weeks Bullen commanded \\"Fort Mulgrave\\", a battery mounted opposite the town, and on 20 November 1793 was appointed commander of the 20-gun sloop . That vessel being absent at the time, he was appointed acting-captain of the 36-gun frigate , employed as a floating battery. When the British finally evacuated Toulon, Proselyte brought out 300 Spanish and Neapolitan troops. In March 1794, during the early part of the Siege of Bastia, Bullen served as a volunteer under Captain Walter Serocold, who had superseded him as commander of Proselyte. Towards the end of the operation he commanded an advanced battery. Bullen was invalided out in July 1794, not returning to duty until early 1796, serving first as a volunteer in under Captain Thomas Byam Martin, and distinguishing himself during the recapture of the Tamise.

Between 1964 and 1971 four jute mills established in Pakistan with the small production capacity to meet the domestic demand of jute products. In that way Pakistan Jute Mills Association (PJMA) established.  History of Jute Mills  In 1970, jute industry was established. Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC) launched the initiative to provide packaging material to government agencies for food grains storage. The jute industry is dependent on raw jute imports from Bangladesh. The jute mills are fully equipped with the spinning, weaving and finishing facilities for the production of hessian cloth and jute sacks. The government agencies, public sector corporations and farmers are the lead buyers of the jute products. Usually, jute sacks is being utilized to procure food grains [sugar, wheat etc.] for long term. Other major commodities which are procured in jute sacks are rice, coffee, pulses, ripe seed, cotton seed etc. The Jute Industry in Pakistan has over 30,000 of workforce and fully equipped to meet the demand of the country. Currently, the mills [members of the association] is exporting products globally especially to Sudan, UK, UAE, Iran, Egypt, Thailand and many other countries globally.  Governance  Election Results for the Office bearers/Executive Committee members of Pakistan Jute Mills Association for the year 2012-13, Malik Mohammad Jehangir, Executive Director of Indus Jute Mills Limited, Dhabeji, Karachi and White Pearl Jute Mills Limited, Hafizabad.  Successes  Pakistan Jute Mills Association (PJMA) on regular basis make people aware that jute bag is environment friendly packing [hundred percent biodegradable and recyclable] for the agriculture commodities [especially grains] and the use of woven polypropylene bag is unfavorable for environment and ecology. To meet the requirement of the jute mills Pakistan needs only 150,000 acres. Due to the government‚Äôs decision to use polypropylene bags for procurement has resulted in the closure of five mills out of twelve jute mills of Pakistan. The leading members of PJMA and leading mills are Indus Jute Mills Limited, Dhabeji, Karachi and White Pearl Jute Mills Limited, Hafizabad, Punjab. PJMA launched initiative to convince farmers to sow jute to meet the demand and also to save $100 million annually on import. The association extended full support to the farmers (from plantation to marketing). PJMA also assured farmers regarding free seed provision and promised to provide them guidance. The association also assured farmers buying the whole produce at a better price compared to cotton.

It was released in the United States on April 17, 2014 and in Europe on April 24, 2014. It's a sequel to the 2009 released Bit Boy!! for Nintendo's WiiWare service and the second installment of the Bit Boy!! series. It uses a 3D, isometric playing field, with polygon characters. According to Bplus two more sequels will be released in undefined future. Gameplay Players control a red cube named Kubi (from (kubos) English cube from Old French < Latin cubus < Greek Œ∫œçŒ≤ŒøœÇ (kubos) meaning \\"a cube, a die, vertebra\\". In turn from PIE *keu(b)-, \\"to bend, turn\\".), who they must navigate through a series of worlds. The game follows the principle of rescuing Kubi's friends and avoid monsters that roam the levels. The main goal in each phase, each level consists of 10 normal and 10 action phases, is to rescue seven of Kubis friends. The publisher denotes the game with the terms \\"Hide + Seek\\", \\"Avoid + Collect\\" and \\"Action + Puzzle\\". Each level is based on a square floor plan. On this grid-like basis Kubi is moved. The camera is oriented isometric. The players define how fast Kubi is moving by pressing the control pad and the buttons at the same time. Depending on how fast they are pressed Kubi moves fast or slow. The game uses the 3DS featured play coins to give the player the ability to purchase continues like it would be in a real arcade machine. Plot =Characters= ZeLeLi is a mighty gearwheel-shaped being created out of the essence of our dying sun 7 billion years in the future. ZeLeLi is the origin of time, life and light so it possesses power over these universal forces. Travelling through time and space, ZeLeLi spreads the seed of life and light in all time in the whole universe. Its counterpart are the black Shadow Pl√§ttchen. Forcefully cut out of the negative space of a black hole, the black Shadow Pl√§ttchen represent exactly the opposite of ZeLeLi. Like the ZeLeLi, Pl√§ttchen are not limited within the constrains of time and space. Wherever they come along they spread massive havoc. Central to the plot of the game are two main characters, the games hero Kubi and the game designer Bernd. He appears as a through the air floating pixel head and talks to Kubi during the games sequences. =Story= At the beginning of the game Kubi gets killed by a monster created from the black Shadow Pl√§ttchen. Bernd is devastated and pleads ZeLeLi for help. ZeLeLi turns back the time and gives Kubi and Bernd the ability to speak to each other. In the meantime Bernd deleted the game in which Kubi died to create another one in whom his hero doesn't have to suffer this fate. Kubi thinks that Bernd is the one who has kidnaped all of his friends and refuses to be the hero unless Bernd designs the game exactly like Kubi wants it to be. As the story continues it is hinted that Bernd even if he is the developer of the game is not almighty. The Shadow Pl√§ttchen gained power by killing small fairies called Pixel Flies and by kidnaping their king. With this power they got the ability to take influence on the game. So Kubi and Bernd are forced to work together to save Kubis friends and the game itself. Development Bit Boy!! Arcade was produced by Bplus. The first announcement was made via press release on 16 February 2012 stating that the game was halfway done. A first playable demo was shown at E3 2012. Reception The game received mixed reviews. Nintendo Life praised the overworld, saying it was one of the most interesting on the gaming history and also said it had an excellent soundtrack, but criticized the gameplay was broken and it was hard to play.

From age ten, the drawings of this youthful genius were in great demand, even though he had received no formal artistic training, and faced much opposition in choosing art as a profession. Arriving in London in 1849, he spent some two years in sketching animal life in the Zoological Gardens. During this period he eked out a living by drawing on wood sporting illustrations for Punch and other periodicals. On his return to Salisbury he received numerous commissions, but finding the scope of these too limited, he returned and settled in London in 1857. His first painting exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1856, was ‚ÄòHunters.‚Äô Then followed ‚ÄòThe Casuals‚Äô in 1866, ‚ÄòHome to die: an afternoon fox with the Cotswolds‚Äô in 1868, ‚ÄòThe Tournament‚Äô in 1870, and ‚ÄòSale of New Forest Ponies at Lyndhurst‚Äô in 1872. In 1875, he exhibited a large painting, some fourteen feet in length, depicting ‚ÄòLord Wolverton's Bloodhounds‚Äô - this was highly praised in Whyte-Melville's ‚ÄòRiding Recollections.‚Äô Followed this in 1876 was ‚ÄòColt-hunting in the New Forest‚Äô, in 1877 ‚ÄòThe Fall of Man‚Äô from Milton's ‚ÄòParadise Lost‚Äô and in 1879 ‚ÄòThe Struggle for Existence‚Äô, now in the Walker Fine Art Gallery in Liverpool. In 1881 ‚ÄòRescued‚Äô, in 1883 ‚ÄòLove and War: in the Abbotsbury Swannery‚Äô and in 1885 ‚ÄòCowed‚Äô. ‚ÄòThe Fall of Man‚Äô, depicting a scene from Milton's 'Paradise Lost,' was widely praised and singled out by the Royal Academy for its portrayal of \\"the savagery of the brute nature ensuing upon the disobedience of Adam and Eve\\". Goddard was enthusiastic about all field sports, and at home in both covert and hunting- field. \\"A Hot Chestnut\\" was Goddard's first contribution to the pages of Punch. Although oil-colour was really his medium, his animal drawings were good, and for some years Punch rejoiced in their new-found hunting draughtsman. Goddard though felt that he must paint pictures rather than draw on wood blocks, and left the magazine, after producing fourteen drawings, some of which were adjudged the best horse images seen in its pages since the death of John Leech. Goddard was a great friend of Charles Keene, and for some time shared a studio in Baker Street. He died at his residence at Brook Green, Hammersmith after a short illness, of a chill caught during a visit to his dying father, whom he survived only by a few hours.

The under-occupancy penalty is more commonly referred to as the Bedroom Tax; especially by critics of the changes who argue that they amount to a tax because of the lack of social housing (or in some areas, any rented accommodation) for affected tenants to downsize to (and the refusal to accept the risk of taking in lodgers). The penalties are also criticised as having a disproportionate impact on disabled people. In 2016 it was announced that the penalty would be extended to pensioners. Caroline Abrahams of Age UK, said: \\"Imposing the cap on older tenants will not only cause them anxiety and distress, it is also pointless given the lack of affordable housing options available to them\\".Poorest pensioners to lose hundreds of pounds a year in 'new bedroom tax' BBCPoorest pensioners to lose hundreds of pounds a year in 'new bedroom tax' BBC - \\"And Caroline Abrahams, charity director of Age UK, said: 'Imposing the cap on older tenants will not only cause them anxiety and distress, it is also pointless given the lack of affordable housing options available to them. [...] It will create hardship without any significant financial gains for the Government.'\\" Supporters of the changes have referred to the unreformed system as a \\"spare room subsidy\\" whereby tax-payers allegedly subsidised social-housing tenants living in houses larger than their needs required. The stated intention of the under-occupancy penalty policy is to reduce these costs and to ease housing shortages and overcrowding. A similar policy was enacted over a decade beforehand in private-sector housing, as the Local Housing Allowance, without attracting controversy, and this policy essentially represents an equalisation of treatment of benefit claimants, regardless of whether they live in private tenancies or social housing. The reforms formed one part of the 2010‚Äì2015 Coalition Government's wide-ranging welfare-reform agenda which included the introduction of Universal Credit, the introduction of a cap on the total size of the welfare bill (see welfare cap), reform of Council Tax and reform of disability benefits (see Personal Independence Payment). Policy The under-occupancy rules apply from 1 April 2013 and applies to all those of working age. Having one bedroom more than the calculated allowance means a reduction in housing benefit of 14%, and two \\"spare\\" bedrooms means that a tenant will lose 25% of their housing benefit. The rules for calculating allowed bedrooms are the same as for Local Housing Allowance for benefit claimants in private sector tenancies, except for the rules involving disability or the armed forces. One bedroom is allowed for each of the following: *An adult couple *Each other person aged 16 and over *Two children of the same sex under 16 *Two children who are under 10 regardless of sex *Any other child (other than a foster child whose main home is elsewhere) *A non-resident carer (or group of carers) for a person in the house requiring overnight care *Where a room is required by a disabled child who is unable to share a bedroom =Exemptions= A number of types of housing are exempt from the changes. These include those living in temporary accommodation, shared ownership accommodation and non-standard accommodation such as houseboats and mobile homes. There is a further category of exempt accommodation defined as \\"accommodation provided by a housing association, a registered charity or voluntary association where that body, or a person acting on its behalf, also provides the claimant with care or support\\" (supported housing), \\"or supervision\\" (sheltered housing). The UK Supreme Court ruled that failing to provide a bed room for the partner of a severely disabled tenant was a breach of that partner's human rights to a home. A room is needed in that tenancy for the disabled partner's medical equipment.UK government loses supreme court fight over bedroom tax The Guardian If a \\"spare\\" bedroom is created following a death then a council tenant's housing benefit will not be reduced until a year after the death. Rationale The official rationale of the policy is to encourage council tenants of homes that are supposedly too large for their needs to move to smaller homes so that the existing housing stock can be better used. A second rationale adopted by the Department for Work and Pensions is to reduce the overall housing benefit bill.Wilson, W. (2013) Under-occupation of social housing: Housing Benefit entitlement, House of Commons Library, SN/SP/6272 p 4 In 2012, speaking in the House of Lords, Lord Freud stated: > I remind noble Lords of the core argumentation. We do not think that > taxpayers should be expected to meet the cost of somewhere approaching 1 > million spare bedrooms, a cost of around ¬£0.5 billion every year. Clearly > this is unfair, or certainly different, to those in the private rented > sector who receive benefits based on their household need.HL Deb 14 February > 2012 c706 Public opinion In a November 2013, opinion poll carried out by Ipsos Mori found that more of the public supported than opposed the reduction of housing benefit for under-occupying social housing tenants. The policy was most popular among owner occupiers and least popular among social renters. In July 2014, a YouGov poll found that 49% of people opposed \\"the bedroom tax\\" and 41% supported it.William Jordan, ‚ÄòBedroom tax as divisive as ever‚Äô, 18 July 2014, YouGov.co.uk Positions of political parties =Conservatives= The Conservative Party has tended to refer to the under-occupancy penalty as the removal of a \\"spare room subsidy\\" (implicitly taking into consideration the entire housing benefit paid out for the tenancy, rather than the net payment made by the tenant). Writing in The Telegraph Conservative Minister Iain Duncan Smith has argued: > We need to put an end to the unfair situation where the taxpayer is > subsidising people to have homes, paid for by the state, with spare rooms > they do not need. This is effectively a spare room subsidy. Britain can not > afford it and nor can the taxpayer. =Liberal Democrats= As members of the Coalition government, the Liberal Democrats leadership supported the Welfare Reform Act 2012. However, of the party's 57 MPs, 38 voted in favour, 18 abstained and one, Manchester Withington MP John Leech who was the first MP to speak out against the bill, voted against.https://www.publicwhip.org.uk/division.php?date=2011-06-15&house;=commons&number;=297 At their 2013 Spring Conference, members voted to review the policy that looks at the \\"money saved, costs incurred and the effect on vulnerable tenants\\". In March 2014 Inside Housing reported that the Liberal Democrats plan to scrap the \\"bedroom tax\\" for all except those who refuse a suitable and reasonable offer of accommodation. This represents a change in position as the party voted against a similar amendment to the 2012 Welfare Reform Act. Liberal Democrat Tim Farron (at that time President of the party) has also criticised the distorting effect that the under occupancy changes have on the market. Following their change in policy, the Liberal Democrats voted with Labour on 5 September 2014, for Lib Dem MP Andrew George's private members bill to restrict the number of cases in which the penalty could be levied. In their 2017 general election manifesto, the Liberal Democrats declared their intention to scrap the bedroom tax. =Scottish National Party= In their 2015 General Election manifesto the Scottish National Party stated that: \\"We will vote for the immediate abolition of the unfair bedroom tax\\". =Labour= The Labour Party, pledged to repeal the act had they been elected in 2015. =Other parties= The under-occupancy penalty is opposed by the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition,Trade Union and Socialist Coalition Press Pack the UK Independence Party, the British National Party, the Green Party of England & Wales, Plaid Cymru, the Democratic Unionist Party, the Social Democratic & Labour Party (SDLP), the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, the Ulster Unionist Party and Sinn F√©in. Reaction Protesters opposing the under occupancy penalty outside the Scottish Parliament. The term \\"bedroom tax\\" is used by critics to describe the changes to social housing occupancy rules. In August 2013, The Independent newspaper released figures which (it argued) showed that 96% of the people who would be affected by the changes would be unable to move anywhere else due to the lack of available social housing. Although it is illegal to sub-let a social tenancy, it is perfectly legal for social tenants in this situation to take in lodgers, to cover the extra cost and is encouraged by the government; potentially, this provides the tenant with a net profit, and reduces the total number of people seeking alternative accommodation. The under-occupancy penalty has been criticised for potentially costing more than it saves by forcing individuals into the private rented sector, where rents are higher, thereby increasing the cost to the taxpayer. The National Housing Federation has estimated that the housing benefit bill could increase by ¬£143 million if affected tenants were to downsize by moving into smaller privately rented accommodation. However the Government argues that freeing up social housing would also reduce the cost of housing people in expensive temporary accommodation; since those people would be more likely to find themselves in overcrowded accommodation as compared to those affected by the penalty, the combined impact should be to reduce net costs, and reduce net overcrowding. =Impact of death= Michael Rosen writing in The Guardian has criticised how, under government proposals, parents living in social housing could become liable for what he calls the bedroom tax after only three months following the death of a child, something that inadvertently causes the creation of a \\"spare\\" room. In March 2015, The Daily Mirror reported that a woman had become liable for the bedroom tax after her son's death from a brain haemorrhage following an assault. =Effect on disabled people= The changes in housing benefit have been criticised for having a disproportionate effect on disabled families. Two-thirds of individuals affected by the under-occupancy penalty are disabled. Historically, most care and support for disabled individuals was provided by local councils, and their predecessors, rather than central government; in consequence there is an expectation from the government that costs arising out of care needs, including extra bedroom space, should be met by local council budgets. However, over the 20th century, central government took over the cost of providing benefits that cover housing costs; therefore, the government provided a new annual grant to councils, so that they can make discretionary housing payments for disabled people in this situation. The government has recently merged this grant into the general funding provided to councils. Legal challenges In July 2012, the High Court rejected the premise that the policy was a breach of Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights due to the effect on disabled people. In January 2015, it was announced that the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom would rule in March 2016 on whether the \\"bedroom tax\\" was illegal on the basis that it unfairly discriminated against disabled adults. In May 2015, a father successfully challenged the penalty at a tribunal. The father had separated from his partner but was able to argue that his \\"spare\\" room was occupied by his son who stayed with him three nights a week. However, it was believed that the Government would challenge the ruling. In February 2016, a decision by the Upper Tribunal involving Stevenage Borough Council considered the question of what constituted a room for the purposes of the regulations. Judge Lloyd- Davies decided that a room \\"should be capable of accommodating a single adult bed, a bedside table and somewhere to store clothes, as well as providing space for dressing and undressing\\". This implies a minimum size of 65.81 square feet for a rectangular room. On 13 November 2019, according to the Guardian, the Supreme Court ruled that \\"applying a 14% housing benefit reduction to a man, referred [sic] only as RR, was a breach of his right to home under the Human Rights Act. RR‚Äôs partner is severely disabled so 'it is accepted' that the couple need an extra bedroom for her medical equipment, Lady Hale said\\". =Case law= *Lall v Westminster City Council *SSWP v David Nelson and Fife Council *Rutherford v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions *Bolton Metropolitan Borough Council v BF (HB) *RR v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (2019) Effect A 2018 study found the bedroom tax \\"was not successful in encouraging residential moves\\", but \\"it did incentivise people who moved to downsize ‚Äì suggesting some success in terms of one of the policy goals, namely reducing under-occupancy. The policy did not incentivise people to work more and we find no statistically significant effects on households' food consumption or saving behaviour\\". The Centre for Housing Policy at the University of York have concluded that the under-occupation policy has saved money, but that the potential savings forecast by the Department for Work and Pensions have been overestimated. The use of Discretionary Housing Payment has partly reduced the savings predicted for the penalty. In the twelve months since the policy was introduced, the original aim of freeing up underoccupied properties had, in the eyes of some, largely failed. In July 2014, a report was published by the DWP that said only one in twenty claimants affected by the change had downsized their property. A study published four months earlier had similar results. The report also showed that there has been great demand for downsizing properties but there has been nowhere near sufficient supply of suitable sized housing. In response to this report, the Liberal Democrats signalled a change in their support for the policy, with both Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander stating that they would like to see changes to the way it is implemented.

Blumenthal began work upon the recipe in 1993, and eventually developed the three-stage cooking process for their preparation. The preparation process involves the chips first being simmered and then cooled and drained of water using a sous-vide technique or by freezing, deep fried at and again cooled, and finally deep fried again at . The result is what Blumenthal calls \\"chips with a glass-like crust and a soft, fluffy centre\\". History Blumenthal said he was \\"obsessed with the idea of the perfect chip\\",Blumenthal, In Search of Perfection and described how, from 1992 onwards, he worked on a method for making \\"chips with a glass-like crust and a soft, fluffy centre\\".Blumenthal, The Big Fat Duck Cookbook He researched the starch content of different varieties of potato and experimented with drying chips by microwaving, desiccating or even individually pinpricking them. Eventually Blumenthal developed the three-stage cooking process generally known as triple-cooked chips, which he identifies as \\"the first recipe I could call my own\\". Preparation =Blumenthal's technique= Previously, the traditional practice for cooking chips was a two-stage process, in which chipped potatoes were fried in oil first at a relatively low temperature to soften them and then at a higher temperature to crisp up the outside. Heston's recipe involves simmering the potatoes first in water for 20‚Äì30 minutes until they are almost falling apart and have developed many little cracks across the surface, at which point they are drained and as much moisture as possible is expelled by placing them in either a freezer or desiccator machine. This additional stage is designed to achieve three objectives. First, cooking the potatoes gently in water helps ensure they acquire a properly soft texture. Second, the cracks that develop in the chips provide places for oil to collect and harden during frying, making them crunchy.Blumenthal, Heston Blumenthal at Home Third, thoroughly drying out the chips drives off moisture that would otherwise keep the crust from becoming crisp. Blumenthal describes moisture as the \\"enemy\\" of crisp chips. The second of the three stages is frying the chips at for approximately 5 minutes, after which they are cooled once more in a freezer or sous-vide machine before the third and final stage: frying at for approximately 7 minutes until crunchy and golden. The second stage of low-temperature frying is as essential as the first, according to Heston, as it makes \\"any starch left in the surface cells dissolve and combine to create a rigid outer layer that can withstand the higher temperature of the final frying\\". This second stage is time-consuming, he acknowledges, but must not be omitted. \\"A single frying at a high temperature leads to a thin crust that can easily be rendered soggy by whatever moisture remains in the chip‚Äôs interior.\\" Other chefs, such as Jo√´l Robuchon, had previously used such a method of cooking chips in simmering water before subjecting them to a two-stage frying.Jeffrey Steingarten, The Man Who Ate Everything (New York: Vintage Books, 1998), 409 =Variations= Triple cooked duck fat chips served at the Park Hyatt Washington. Variations include using a refrigerator to cool the chips in between cooking times and the use of different temperatures, such as for the first cooking and for the second. Triple Cooked Chips cooked in duck fat is another variation. Various cultivars of potato are used, such as sebago, Rooster and Maris Piper. Popularity First served at The Fat Duck in 1995, triple-cooked chips have since become a standard feature in restaurants. Reception The Sunday Times described Blumenthal's dish as \\"arguably his most influential culinary innovation\\", and felt that it gave the chip \\"a whole new lease of life\\".

She was known as the first lady of isopods and was one of the first female carcinologists, with only Mary Jane Rathbun before her. Biography Richardson was born on May 9, 1874 in Washington DC to Charles and Charlotte Ann Richardson. She attended the Friends School and Mount Vernon Seminary in Washington before attending Vassar College - where she became interested in biology - from which she graduated in 1896 with a BA, and again with a master's degree in zoology in 1901. In 1901 Richardson was appointed Collaborator in the Division of Marine Invertebrates at the National Museum of Natural History. She earned her PhD in the same field from Columbian University (now George Washington University) in 1903. Richardson began working with the Smithsonian in 1896. She worked at the museum unpaid by the Smithsonian for about twenty years. During this time she produced more output than many that were paid for a lifetime of research. Richardson married William Searle, a lawyer, on December 10, 1913 with whom she had one child, named William, on September 5, 1914. Her son had a mental or physical handicap, resulting in a large amount of her time being spent looking after him. Richardson died at Hahnemann University Hospital on March 28, 1958. Her husband died shortly after. In 1972 , their son, William Richardson Searle, was buried with them at Arlington National Cemetery. Outside of her work on isopods, Richardson was the President of the Vassar College Club of Washington, D.C. from 1911‚Äì1912 and she was a charter member of the Captain Molly Pitcher Chapter, Daughters of the American Revolution, going on to be a Historian, Treasurer, Vice-Regent, and then Regent from 1914‚Äì1915. She was a member of the Biological Society of Washington, the Washington Academy of Sciences, and the Washington Society of Fine Arts. Research Richardson focused on research on isopod (and tanaid) systematics, and began publishing papers on isopoda in 1897; her first study was on the Socorro Isopod and she went on to publish a total of 80 papers. Her best known work was A Monograph on the Isopods of North America, published in the Bulletin of the U.S. National Museum in 1905. This work covered all terrestrial, freshwater, and marine isopods in North America with keys, references, and descriptions. This work was reprinted in 1972, meaning it has had a lasting impact on the field. She wrote reports in foreign publications, including materials from the National Museum of Natural History, Paris and the Rothschild collections from East Africa. Richardson wrote some of her papers in French. Over the course of her career Richardson described over 70 new genera and nearly 300 new species of isopods and tanaids, many of which she named after colleagues or those who gifted collections to her. In turn the isopod species Caecidotea richardsonae and harpacticoida copepod genus Harrietella, among many others, are named after her. After the birth of her son Richardson had to spend a large amount of time caring for him and thus spent less time on her research, publishing papers only occasionally, with her last in 1922. Before December 1952, 6 years before her death, the museum changed her title to Research Associate instead of Collaborator.  Honors  Richardson has the isopod genus Harrieta Kensley, 1987 and the harpacticoid gunus Harrietella T. Scott, 1906 named for her, as well as many species of marine isopods.

Bradshaw designed several posters for London Transport from 1935 to 1937. In 1955, Bradshaw won the commission to design the Tomb of Karl Marx at his burial place in Highgate Cemetery. Bradshaw designed the whole of Marx's monument including the plinth and the calligraphy of the texts on the monument, but did not sign the finished work. Bradshaw considered that his design must be \\"...not a monument to a man only but to a great mind and a great philosopher.\\" The tomb was designated a Grade I listed monument in 1974. Other notable communist figures that Bradshaw sculpted included the African- American scholar and activist W. E. B.

She was registered as Western Australia's first female architect in October 1924. Late in 1925 she travelled to Melbourne, with her parents and in the following year she started working with the architectural firm, Cedric Ballantyne before studying at the University of Melbourne's Architectural Atelier. She then joined the firm, A. & K. Henderson. In 1929 she returned to Perth and joined an architectural firm established by F.G.B. Hawkins, where she worked on the design of the Atlas Assurance Company Office from 1930 to 1931. In the early 1930s, Morison joined the Poster Studios, a commercial art business established by architects Harold Krantz, John Oldham and Colin Ednie- Brown. She then undertook the design of the Myola Club in Claremont with Krantz in 1934. During the following years, she worked mainly for Oldham, Boas and Ednie-Brown, where she did the interior detailing of the Adelphi Hotel, the remodelling of the Karrakatta Club in 1936 and the detailing of the Emu Brewery from 1936 to 1938. In the late 1930s, she established herself as an architectural designer and set up her own practice with Heimann (Heinz) Jacobsohn. The practice, however, closed due to the outbreak of World War II. She worked for the Commonwealth Department as a camouflage officer in 1942. She then went to Melbourne and was employed by architect H. Vivian Taylor, returning to Perth in 1948 where she taught an architectural course at Old Perth Technical School until 1962. At the 1953 Western Australian state election, Pitt Morison stood as an Australian Labor Party candidate for the Legislative Assembly seat of Nedlands. Although she was not elected, there was a swing away from the sitting member Charles Court. In 1967, she commenced work for the City Planners Department at the City of Perth as an assistant research officer, continuing until 1971. In 1971, she was employed by the University of Western Australia in the School of Architecture and Fine Arts as a research officer, where she remained until her death in 1985. In 1979 she was made a Life Fellow of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects. In the same year she published Western Towns and Buildings, with co-editor John White, a comprehensive study of 19th and 20th century Western Australian Architecture. Death and legacy Pitt Morison died at Nedlands on 12 December 1985. The University of Western Australia awards the Margaret Pitt- Morison Memorial Prize to outstanding environmental design students.

History Transun was established in 1982 by Yugoslavian-born Paul Kostich, who founded the company at the age of 30. He had started working as a tour guide in India, East Africa, China, and Thailand at the age of 18, and was working in the airline industry in London when he decided to start Transun. He began with offering tours to Yugoslavia, then diversified into a number of different excursions throughout Europe. He now serves as the company‚Äôs President. The company grew throughout the 1990s and early 2000s to include travel experiences and day trips to destinations such as Lapland, Cairo, Marrakesh, Bergen, and Florence. They also began establishing relationships with airports throughout the UK in order to charter flights to these and other destinations. The company received special attention at the World Travel Market in 2002 for its travel offerings to Thailand, receiving a visit from Her Royal Highness Princess Ubolratana of the kingdom of Thailand, as well as Thailand‚Äôs Minister of Tourism Sontaya Kunplome. Both were interested in Transun‚Äôs focus on Koh Samui as a primary destination for the company‚Äôs travel packages. One of the main focuses of Transun in the late 1990s and early 2000s was promoting tourism to the territories impacted by the Yugoslav Wars. The company promoted travel to places in the Balkans such as Croatia and Slovenia, spending up to ¬£750,000 in two and a half years without support from the Croatia National Tourist Office. Their efforts became a topic of several academic studies of tourism in the region. Transun opened offices in Leeds and London, but later closed those locations in 2005 as part of a reorganization preceding the global recession. The company had also peaked at 200 employees, but reduced those numbers during its restructuring to focus on its digital presence. They currently have offices in Oxford, Bangkok, and Koh Samui in Thailand. Transun Today Transun currently has a number of tour operations. Among them is a location in Lapland, where Transun arranges short breaks that include a trip to see Santa in a cabin located in the woods. Their catalogue includes holidays to Iceland, Greenland, Sweden, and other locations suitable for seeing the Northern Lights, currently a popular attraction for European travelers. The company currently operates the largest number of flights to Lapland direct from the UK - more than any other operator. There is a particular focus on Enontekio Airport in Finland and Kiruna Airport in Sweden, and charter flights run from small UK regional airports such as Norwich, Exeter and Humberside as well as the larger 'hubs' of Manchester and Gatwick.

The family, part Dutch verLoren family then once again moved, this time to the newly constructed house Grandpr√© Moli√®re in the nearby village of Berg en Dal. After finishing his secondary education at the gymnasium in Nijmegen verLoren wished to become an architect.

VerLoren thus chose to study law at Leiden University. He earned his Master of law in 1939. He wished to work on his doctoral thesis on international tax law under the supervision of professor Ben Telders (nl).

In 1958 verLoren moved to Brussels to work for the then recently founded European Economic Community. He was made director-general of the department of competition. Together with European Commissioner Hans von der Groeben he worked on Council Regulation 17/62, which served for forty years as an important foundation of European Union competition law. In 1967 he returned to the Netherlands and was appointed professor of socio-economic law at Utrecht University, the first professor in this subject area in the Netherlands. In 1981 he reached the age of retirement.

The concept is commonly used in military tactical modelling and scientific simulation; and is connected to the idea of shielding friendly forces (as well as foes) from detection and deception.  Definition  Mimicking operations is a ‚Äì ‚Äúcost-effective way of achieving a desired operational effect using superior deception tactics to exploit concealment and camouflage opportunities‚Äù.  Relationship with military deception operations  Carlo Kopp identified in 2002 that 'deception and Mimicry is the insertion of intentionally misleading information. It amounts to mimicking a known signal so well, that a receiver cannot distinguish the phony signal from the real signal.'  Relationship with Fifth Dimension Operations  The mimicking operations concept was acknowledged as an early iteration of contemporary Fifth Dimension Operations.  Use of examples from nature  The concept of mimicking operations simulates activity that resembles a bacterial attack on a large and complex organism. Attacking cells mimic the behavior of their victims, but remain dormant while awaiting an opportunity to launch an attack. The development of mimicking operations has been influenced by biology, ecology and the workings of the natural world. * A species evolves the appearance of another to aid its survival. * Animals or insects develop a physical similarity to their predators, in order to avoid danger. * Portia spiders strum the webs of other spiders to imitate mating behaviors or the actions of distressed prey.  Military tactics use  In military tactics, the employment of mimicking operational strategies, is based on concepts: * A potential target is given confusing information and is encouraged to walk into what appears to be a safe situation. * The use of mimicry manipulates information through the simulation of behavior or of physical appearance. * Mimicking operations represents an increasingly cost-effective way of achieving a desired operational effect using superior information to exploit concealment, deception and imitation techniques.  Mimicking operations as a subset of military deception  Mimicking Operations is a subset of military deception. From a logistics perspective the capacity to develop a deception strategy, reflects the relative capacity of the combatant to collect the resources to develop suitable deception. In the case of terrorism, an individual with few resources is likely to adapt a mimicking strategy, and seek to camouflage themselves. Whereas a more resourced team of terrorists with the backing of an organisation may be more likely to afford the resources to develop a decoy, as part of a developed deception strategy.

Early life  Stephanides was born in Trikomo a village located in the North-east part of Cyprus. When he was eight years old, his father took him from Cyprus to the United Kingdom. Following his parents separation when he was still an infant, he lived with his grandparent in the village. His work documents warm memories of village life of that time that period, which was also marked by the emergence of the EOKA organization and the struggle against British Colonial Rule. His father settled in Bristol but Stephanides was left in Manchester for two years with his uncle's family. He subsequently went to school in Bristol. In his teenage years he developed a love for literature, writing poetry, and learning foreign languages when he was at school and was encouraged by his teachers to pursue literary studies at University. Stephanides graduated from Cardiff University, Wales, in 1973, and obtained a PhD from the same University in 1981.  Life and work  He left the United Kingdom in 1976 and lived and travelled in Greece, Spain, and Portugal for two years before receiving an appointment with the University of Guyana in 1978 where he stayed for six years. As a result, he became immersed in Caribbean and Brazilian culture. He moved to Washington DC in the mid-80s where he worked as a professional translator and conference interpreter, researcher and writer. In 1985 he was awarded a grant by the American Translators Association to translate a book on British Guyana written in Portuguese in the 19th century by a Portuguese writer. In 1988 he made a documentary film on Kali worship in Guyana called Hail Mother Kali that was short-listed for an award for excellence by the Society of Anthro-Journalism. In 1989 he was awarded the poetry award of the Society for Humanistic Anthropology of the American Anthropological Association (AAA)http://www.aaanet.org/sections/sha/sha-prize- winners/ for poetry written during field work in Guyana. In 1991 he returned to Cyprus accompanied by his US-born wife and daughter.http://www.aaanet.org/sections/sha/sha-prize-winners/ Stephanides cites a variety of authors from differing cultural and social backgrounds as influences in his work. He cites Derek Walcott as an influence in the English language, drawing inspiration from him through the way he brings together the Creole idiom into with the classical. He also cites Constantine P. Cavafy as a favourite. He was a friend of the Greek-Cypriot writer Niki Marangou, translating her poetry into English and maintaining a close literary relationship with her until her death.  Contribution to Cypriot literature Stephanides serves as an advisory editor for the publication of Cadences, a journal of literature and the arts in Cyprus which is published by European University Cyprus. He has served twice as a judge for the Commonwealth Writers Prize in 2000 and 2010. He was made Fellow of the English Association and Cavaliere of the Republic of Italy for promoting the Italian culture in Cyprus. In his recent documentary entitled No Man's Land he managed to unite poets from different cultural and linguistic background bringing together speakers of minority languages, such as Catalan, Lithuanian and Portuguese. In 2009, he edited a special issue on Cypriot writing for 91st Meridian, an online publication by the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa, where he also attended the 2016 Fall Residency. The Routledge Encyclopedia for postcolonial writing has also enlisted an entry for Cypriot literature. Selected bibliography since 2000 Monographs * Blue Moon in Rajasthan and other poems.

Overview The lake was formed in 1925 when Blue Ridge Power built a dam on the Green River at Turner Shoals. Lake Adger is approximately 438 acres and has over 14 miles of shoreline. The property around Lake Adger is private with the exception of a public boat landing that is leased from Lake Adger Homeowners Association by the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission for $15,000 a year for public boating and fishing. In 2009 the lake was purchased by Polk County for $1.6 million. Polk County now owns the Lake Adger Dam, all land under the water and all land to the high water line around Lake Adger. Lake Adger was named after Blue Ridge Power Company's founder, John Adger Law. John Adger Law's mother's maiden name was Adger and he chose to name the lake after her family' surname. The lake was originally named Turner Shoals Lake but John decided to change the name after the Dam was complete. The Dam is still known as Turner Shoals Dam. As of 2014, the Dam was still operated by Northbrook Hydroelectric, who leases it from Polk County,for water release and electricity. The Duke Power Steam station at Cliffside, NC, downstream of Lake Adger, uses the water released by Turner Shoals to cool the plant's turbines.

In aerial combat over China and the Pacific, it is said that he shot down 54 enemy aircraft. Biography Okumura was born in Fukui Prefecture, Japan in February 1920. He enlisted in the Navy in 1935, started Air Corps training in February 1938, and graduated in September. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, he was assigned to the 14th Air Group of northern French Indochina in 1940. His first battle was 7 October 1940. This day, 27 G3M \\"Nells\\" escorted by 7 A6M2 \\"Zeros\\" of the 14th Air Group, attacked the Kunming. In aerial combat, 7 Zeros were shot down, as well as 13 I-15s of the China Air Force. Okumura shot down four I-15s. In 1942, after the start of World War II, Okumura was assigned to the carrier Ryujo fighter Corps. He fought in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons on 24 August 1942. He covered the squadron attacking the enemy fleet. He became missing during the fierce fighting, and was for a time thought to have been killed in action. Then, Okumura was assigned to the Tainan Air Group based in Rabaul. He recorded 14 shot down enemy aircraft in the Solomons in the period before returning to Japan in December. Okumura returned to Rabaul in July 1943 as a member of the 201st Air Group. He shot down 10 enemy aircraft in the interception role against the sky Buin on 14 September. After the battle, Admiral Jinichi Kusaka, commander of 11th Air Fleet at Rabaul, presented him with a ceremonial sword for distinguished service. Okumura was assigned to escort bombers for the enemy convoy attack off Cape Cretin, New Guinea on 22 September. He was killed after starting a dogfight with a P-38 and a P-40. At the time of his death, Okumura's rank was Petty Officer First Class but he received a posthumous promotion to Chief Petty Officer. His formal number of kills is unknown, because IJN did not disclose the number of kills in 1943 and later. Henry Sakaida estimated that Okumura certainly shot down 4 aircraft in China and about 50 aircraft in the Solomons.

Life Partington was associated with the London Institution. He lectured successfully also in the North of England, and adopted the style \\"Professor\\". While he at times claimed a closer relationship with the London Institution, professionally he was paid there only as an assistant librarian, by William Maltby. His presumption of a position at the Institute caused friction in the end, and he had to drop any such claim. Partington lectured also at the other institutes in London (the Russell Institution, Surrey Institution, and London Mechanics Institute). He lectured to the short-lived London Chemical Society in 1824. Works Partington published the following: * An Historical and Descriptive Account of the Steam Engine, comprising a General View of the Various Modes of employing Elastic Vapour as a Prime Mover in Mechanics, 1822; 3rd. edit. 1826. * A Brief Account of the Royal Gardens, Vauxhall, 1822. * The Printers' Complete Guide, containing a Sketch of the History and Progress of Printing, 1825. * The Shipbuilder's Complete Guide, 1825. * The Clock and Watchmaker's Complete Guide, 1825. * The Engraver's Complete Guide, 1825. * A Course of Lectures on the Steam Engine, with a work on steam navigation published by Jonathan Hulls, 1826. * A Manual of Natural and Experimental Philosophy, 1828, 2 vols. * Introduction to the Science of Botany, illustrated by a series of highly finished delineations of the plants, coloured to represent Nature, 1835. * An Account of Steam Engines, 1835. * National History and Views of London and its Environs, from original drawings by eminent artists, 2 vols.; 2nd edit. 1835‚Äì7, 2 vols.

However, it was in the interests of the colonial rulers to suppress slave raiding, large-scale slave trading, and the export of slaves, and these ended as their administrations were established. Slavery itself, not covered by the act, was tolerated for many years, and petty slave dealing, together with a small export traffic, continued in some areas until the end of colonial rule. The Brussels conference brought the evils of the slave trade forcefully to public attention, and the act, while serving the interests of the colonial powers, bound them to suppress it. Humanitarians regarded it as a triumph, an important step in the doctrine of trusteeship.

The film was produced in France and Germany and examines the danger posed to agricultural production by energy and resource scarcity. It depicts organic agricultural alternatives in France, the Transition Towns movement and urbanised food production in Cuba as forerunners of the transformation of food production away from industrialised agriculture and towards small-scale, decentralised production methods. The German cinema debut was held on 2 May 2013 as part of a wider German cinema tour, followed or preceded by theatrical releases and tours in Italy[34], USA[35], Portugal[36] Wallonia[5] and Flanders[6] (Belgium), Great Britain[7], Argentina and Chile.[9]  Plot  Using interviews and overlays of graphics and text, the film presents the current problems facing industrial agriculture. It explores why in the interviewees' view the current industrial model is not up to the task of feeding the world's people. According to the film every calorie of energy contained in a food source currently takes between 10 and 20 calories of crude oil in the production of fertilizers and transportation to produce, leading to a strong dependence of the cost of food on oil prices. As a result of peak oil and increasing oil prices this dependence will lead to ever increasing food prices. According to the film, this dependence already represents a significant weak-spot in the global food supply chain. Additionally, agriculture is already responsible for 40% of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change. Furthermore, the film argues that the overuse of inorganic fertilizers has been responsible for the loss of soil fertility and threatens the complete loss of usable soil within the next decades through soil erosion and sinking crop yields. These effects, according to the film, can only be partly mitigated by the increased use of those same fertilizers. The loss of workplaces, the concentration of land in the hands of a few (allegedly a farm closes every 23 minutes in France) as well as the dependence on large corporations are enumerated as side effects of the industrialisation of agriculture since the 1920s. Companies, such as Monsanto and Bayer, control everything from seed stock to fertilizers and the necessary chemical mixes for hybrid plants, thereby controlling the entire supply chain. The film argues that this development was supported through subsidies from the World Bank. Interviews with Vandana Shiva, the founder of the Transition Towns movement Rob Hopkins and various agricultural experts serve to argue this viewpoint. The dependence on crude oil is illustrated through the example of the wholesale food market in Rungis. Agroforestry in Normandy To illustrate alternative scenarios the documentary visits places in England and France to conduct various interviews. Agroforestry expert Martin Crawford gives a tour of his forest garden, explaining how the assortment of different plants on various levels results in a symbiotic relationship between them whereby they supply each other with nutrients. He explains the high productivity rate and efficiencies realised through the use of these Permaculture principles. A further application is shown on farmlands, where rows of trees are planted with cereal crops in between. As a result, the later can still be harvested using large-scale machinery, while the trees provide a better microclimate by providing living space for animals, much higher rates of biodiversity and a replenishing of the soil as a result of the regular loss of root structures. According to the interviewees in the film the trees themselves could provide a counterbalance to the deficit of wood in European countries, act as carbon sinks and contribute to the value of the land. As experts on these matters the film presents Christian Dupraz from the French Institut national de la Recherche Agronomique as well as French soil scientist Claude Bourguignon. Rob Hopkins The second part of the film depicts the British Transition Towns initiative, whose local actors claim to promote a more liveable future by building resilient structures in anticipation of the threats of peak oil, climate change and economic crises. The film shows Permaculture gardener Mike Feingold as he works in his allotment and whilst making apple juice from apples he has harvested himself. Further, the film highlights barter markets, local currencies such as the Totnes Pound and events where plants are planted with the goal of making 'edible cities'. Sally Jenkins, as representative for the project Grofun (Growing Real Organic Food in Urban Neighbourhoods) shows how she plants food in her front yard to inspire her neighbours to do the same. Co-founder of the initiative Rob Hopkins, who stresses the importance of building a vision that will be able to carry people through the decades to come, further explains the whole movement. According to him this will act both as the means to jointly prepare for looming crises while simultaneously re- learning to enjoy life. Cooperative Alamar, Cuba The final third of the film turns to Cuba, whose agriculture was cut off from the use of crude oil and global food markets at the beginning of the 1990s due to the fall of the Soviet Union. As a result, community gardens and urban agriculture developed, in which organically grown food is produced. The film claims that the Cuban capital Havana is able to source 70% of its fresh vegetable needs directly within the city or its immediate surroundings, with a yield of up to 20 kg per square meter. Fernando Funes-Monzote, co-founder of the Grupo de Agricultura Organica (winners of the 1999 Right Livelihood Award) appears as the main interviewee. He claims that Cuba must be the only country which is close to developing a sustainable food supply, a claim which is supported by a WWF study according to which Cuba is the only country to fulfil the minimal criteria for sustainable development. Governmental support of urban agriculture has led to a higher degree of food sovereignty and a degree of independence from the world market and oil prices. Because of this, Cuba's forced development could serve as an example for other countries whose resource shortages are yet to come.  Background  Director Nils Aguilar explained in an interview that he was \\"deeply moved\\" by the experience of large agricultural companies using thugs to silence indigenous groups protesting against their displacement in Argentina. Examining concepts such as permaculture since 2003 and the themes of the book Le Sol, la Terre et les Champs by French soil scientist Claude Bourguignon further inspired him to make the film, which aims to \\"‚Ä¶inspire action by showing positive solutions.\\" The stated aim of the project is to give the Transition Towns Movement an educational tool with which to promote organic agriculture. Aguilar, born 1980 in T√ºbingen, started the project with a Co-Director who left the film early on as he \\"‚Ä¶didn't really believe in it.\\" As a result, Aguilar decided to master the project as a \\"non-specialist autodidact\\", which took around four years. The film depended in large part on voluntary help, as a result of the fact that the Director himself produced the low-budget film. The film was supported by the European Union Programme Youth in Action and the French Ministry of Youth's Envie d'agir Programme. Two successful crowdfunding campaigns also contributed to the making of the documentary. The film is being independently distributed in Germany.  Screenings  A very first prescreening of the yet unfinalised film was organised during the Transition Towns movement conference in Hannover in November 2010.

She served primarily as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named for Port Colborne, Ontario. Port Colborne was ordered in April 1942 as part of the 1942‚Äì1943 River-class building program. She was laid down on 16 December 1942 by Yarrows Ltd. at Esquimalt and launched 21 April 1943. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 15 November 1943 at Victoria, British Columbia. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. War service After working up in Bermuda, Port Colborne was assigned to escort group EG 9 based out of Derry. Beginning in May 1944 she remained in United Kingdom waters on anti-submarine patrols and local escort duty. She participated in Operation Neptune, the naval component of the Invasion of Normandy in June 1944. She returned to her previous duties until December 1944 when she escorted two Russian convoys, JW 62 and RA 62. Port Colborne returned to Canada in February 1945 to undergo a tropicalization refit at Liverpool in preparation for service in the southern Pacific Ocean. This was completed 24 September 1945 and she was paid off at Halifax on 7 November and laid up in Bedford Basin. In 1947 she was taken to Sydney, Nova Scotia and broken up.

The exact use of liturgical combs during the Middle Ages remains unclear. They may have been used in the ceremony accompanying the consecration of a bishop, or before or during the celebration of Mass. Liturgical combs are also known to have been venerated as relics of saints. Possibly they were also used in an everyday, secular context. Liturgical combs were distinguished from secular combs by their design and decoration. So for example were liturgical combs from the 9th and 10th centuries made from a single piece of material (often ivory) and had teeth on both sides, while ordinary, secular combs usually were made in several parts and had teeth on only one side. The decoration also differed in that secular combs from this period usually had abstract, geometric decoration while liturgical combs were decorated with religious scenes.

Consisting of three individual bores, the tunnel is somewhat unusual as there is a slight bend in its alignment. The first bore was constructed during the 1830s, the engineering of which having been performed by the pioneering railway builder George Stephenson. The only of the three bores to accommodate double track, it was first opened to traffic during 1837. During 1857, the eastern bore was opened to serve a branch line from Leighton Buzzard to Dunstable; this has since been closed. In 1876, the western bore was completed, being noticeably narrower than its predecessors. During the 1960s, Linslade Tunnel was outfitted with overhead electrification as part of a wider scheme to introduce electric traction on the West Coast Main Line. In the 1970s, the tunnel portals on either side of the tunnel were recognised as grade II listed buildings due to their connection to early railway engineering history. During the 2010s, remedial engineering works were performed in the tunnel. History =Construction= A total of three bores have been constructed to date, the first of these being the central bore. This is the tallest of the three, and the only one that carries twin tracks. It was also the first tunnel on the site to be constructed, an individual contract for its construction on behalf of the London and Birmingham Railway being issued around 1834, shortly after the purchasing of land along the route was authorised by an Act of Parliament in 1833. The engineering work was performed by the pioneering railway builder George Stephenson. The local geology largely consisted of clay and iron sand.Osborne 1840, p. 135. Possessing a length of and a depth of roughly , its excavation involved the removal of 20,433 cubic yards of spoil. Atypically, the bore has a slight curvature or bend along its length. This first bore was completed during 1837, and services commenced running through it thereafter. Contemporary accounts around the time of its opening described the original Linslade Tunnel as being relatively spacious.Freeling 1838, p. 107. During 1859, the eastern bore became the second to open, carrying a single track to serve a branch line from Leighton Buzzard to Dunstable, which has since been permanently closed. In 1876, the single track western bore was the third to open, it is the narrowest tunnel of the three. The northern portals were finished with a brick castellated retaining wall that incorporated all three of the horseshoe-shaped arches. On 1 May 1975, the northern portals were recognised as a grade II listed building, the listing text observing that it is \\"an interesting example of early railway architecture\\". The southern entrance has also been listed despite being noticeably less ornamental than its northern counterpart. =Activity and services= steam-hauled express emerging from Linslade Tunnel's southern portal, October 1948 During the 1960s, Linslade Tunnel, along with the majority of the West Coast Main Line, had overhead electrification apparatus installed, which facilitated the line's transition to using electric traction. On 9 December 1982, during the British Rail era, a fatal incident occurred at Linslade Tunnel, an inadequately secured load that had fallen from one train was struck by the next train passing through the tunnel, causing its derailment and the death of its driver. During the late 2010s, deteriorated parts of the brickwork within Linslade Tunnel were repaired. In early 2020, the tunnel was again subject to engineering works, largely focused upon a comprehensive track renewal, to improve service reliability. The eastern bore and the eastern side of the central bore are used by goods traffic and West Midlands Trains services to and from London Euston respectively to mainly local stations including traffic using the Northampton Loop Line connecting to and from Birmingham, Rugby, as well as several stations further to the north. The current maximum speed on these lines between Euston and Northampton for passenger traffic is .

Facilities Number of Beds: According to sources, there are 100 beds in this health facility. For residents living in the extended areas of the Bidhannagar township such as Naobhanga, Sukantanagar, and Mahishbatan - this is the only option for an affordable treatment for the common masses. Even patients from far-flung places like Bashirhat, Sunderbans and Sashan opt for this hospital for emergency situations like accidents. There is an operation theatre available in the hospital. There are 2 air-conditioned VIP rooms also available. According to doctors attached to the hospital, they have to handle accident cases almost daily in the morning. The Rajarhat and New Town road being in the vicinity, people end up with severe accidents and injuries due to reckless driving. Most of the patients are first brought to the Bidhannagar Sub-divisional hospital owing to its closeness to Rajarhat and New Town. Transfusion Facilities: The Bidhannagar Sub-Divisional Hospital now has transfusion facilities for Thalassemia patients of the city. The West Bengal state health department can now accommodate these patients. The hospital provides an in-patient unit for people suffering from Thalassemia. Though this is a 100-bed facility, it can easily accommodate 30-40 patients (for blood transfusion) suffering from this ailment. This is an initiative to benefit patients so that unused space in the hospital can be utilized for a good purpose.

On his return, he released the recordings on the Bach Guild label that he set up for the purpose. Later in the year, with the help of a loan from his father and the involvement of his younger brother Maynard, he formed the Vanguard Recording Society, into which the Bach Guild was subsumed. The company took full advantage of the new technology of long-playing records, allowing it to release longer unbroken classical music performances than was previously possible. Although initially recording an eclectic range of classical music, as the label developed through the 1950s and 1960s its roster expanded to include jazz, folk, and blues musicians, including The Weavers, Joan Baez, Odetta, Larry Coryell, Mississippi John Hurt, Charlie Musselwhite, and Buddy Guy. Seymour and Maynard Solomon sold Vanguard in 1986 to the Welk Music Group. In 1988, Seymour Solomon started a new company, Omega Classics, and later bought back Vanguard's classical catalog from Welk, reissuing it on CD on the Omega and Vanguard Classics labels.

He competed in the Olympic Games as a decathlete and a long jumper; his other strong event was the non-Olympic pentathlon, in which he broke the unofficial world record in 1930 and won two medals, including a gold, at the International University Games. Career At the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam Tolamo competed in the decathlon, placing 16th. The following year he exceeded the Finnish long jump record with a jump of 7.42 m, but due to wind assistance that record could not be ratified. At the 1930 Finnish Championships at Tampere he won the pentathlon with 4011 points, an unofficial world record. He also triumphed at that year's International University Games, scoring 3979 points to secure gold ahead of Latvia's JƒÅnis Dimza. Tolamo's world record was broken the following year by javelin thrower Matti Sippala; however, with modern scoring tables Tolamo's score would have remained the record, and it eventually re-emerged as a national pentathlon best, only broken in 2007. Tolamo legitimately broke the Finnish long jump record in 1933 in a dual meet between Finland and Norway, jumping 7.46 m. At that year's International University Games he won silver in the long jump and bronze in the pentathlon. He broke his own national long jump record in September 1934, in another dual meet (between Finland and Germany); he jumped 7.51 m and defeated both Wilhelm Leichum, who had won the European championship the previous week, and future Olympic silver medalist Luz Long. That jump remained the Finnish record until 1954, when Jorma Valkama broke it. Tolamo returned to the Olympics in 1936, competing in both the decathlon and the long jump. He failed to make the final in the long jump and did not finish in the decathlon. He was killed in action during World War II.

She was the managing director of the Sahlgrenska sockerbruket (\\"Sahlgren Sugar refinery\\") in 1736‚Äì1771 and a trade- and shipping company in 1736‚Äì1744. Life Brigitta Sahlgren was the daughter of the merchant Olof Pehrsson Ekmarck and Christina Stillman and married in 1715 to merchant Jacob Sahlgren, who founded the first sugar refinery in Sweden, Sahlgrenska sockerbruket, in 1729, which became one of the greatest businesses in Gothenburg. She took over the refinery, as well as the trade- and shipping company which was also owned by her spouse, when she was widowed in 1736. Sahlgren had a monopoly upon the sugar industry in Sweden. When another merchant applied for permission to found a new one in 1740, she sued him before the government and won after a two-year legal battle. She was represented in court by her son-in-law Count Sparre and her brother-in-law Niclas Sahlgren. However, as she did not manage to increase the sugar production to meet the growing demand (which had been the condition of the government demanded of her in exchange for respecting the monopoly of 1729) Nicolas Jacobson was in 1749, after a new legal battle, allowed to open a second sugar refinery in Gothenburg. The Sahlgrenska sockerbruket kept a leading role in the sugar industry nonetheless. Brigitta Sahlgren had one son, Olaf (died 1758), one daughter, Sara Christina Sahlgren (1723‚Äì1766) who married Count Rutger Axel Sparre , and was succeeded after her death by her grandsons; Jacob Sahlgren and count Gustaf Adolf Sparre.

It is a traditional Otomi community, which has conserved its agricultural economic base and various traditions. However, it is one of the poorest and least populated of the state's municipalities. The town's main landmark is the San Juan Bautista Parish and the municipality contains the remains of colonial era haciendas. The municipality lies on an old lava flow from the nearby La Malinche Volcano, which provides its volcanic soil, but because of the destruction of forests and overgrazing, erosion is a significant problem. The town Parish of San Juan Baustista The town of San Juan Ixtenco has a population of over 5,600 inhabitants. It is centered on a main plaza, which contains the old well, today covered over with a kiosk-like structure. Its main landmark is the San Juan Bautista Parish, originally built in the 17th century, named after the patron saint of John the Baptist. Of the original structure, only the side chapel dedicated to Christ, the octagonal cupola and a posterior building survive. The rest was rebuilt in the century that followed. It has two bell towers, the larger one of gray sandstone, the tallest in Tlaxcala, which contains the state's largest bell, cast in 1906 and donated by Mar√≠a Juana del Carmen de Jes√∫s. The main entrance is carved with motifs of seeds and a flower called ‚Äúchimali.‚Äù In front of this entrance is an atrium cross of stone from the 17th century. The interior is neo classical altars and the main altar is made of carved cypress. To the side of the main altar, there is another small chapel which contains a Baroque altarpiece which probably belonged to the old church. Opposite the plaza from the church is the city hall (municipal palace) which maintains some of its original construction with most modifications made to the interior, with new walls and modern classroom. The outer walls are of 60 cm thick stone. The facade is simple and the roof is tile. Two other chapels face the plaza, the Santa Cruz Chapel and the Virgin of Guadalupe Chapel. The latter was founded by the Franciscans in the 16th century, with construction into the 17th. Its main facade is flat and white, with stone walls up to 90 cm thick. The municipality Socioeconomics San Juan Ixtenco is in a region of the state of Tlaxcala known for its Otomi population. It has kept much of its ethnic identity, traditional and customs, such as the use of the temazcal because of its relative isolation. Its main festivals are that of its patron saint, John the Baptist on June 24 and Carnival . for the latter, the traditional dance is the Huehues (Old Men) accompanied by bands playing wind instruments. The male dancers wear embroidered white shirts and pants and palm frond hats and the women wear embroidered blouses, black skirts and a wrap belt along with rebozo. Traditional dishes include turkey in mole sauce, pipian rojo, barbacoa and dishes made with maguey larvae. The traditional drink is pulque . The municipality is one of the poorest and least populated in Tlaxcala, with just over 60% living in poverty and 6.2% living in extreme poverty. The most important economic activity remains agriculture and livestock production, also the largest employer, followed by commerce and then industry. Crops include corn, wheat, beans, rye, fava beans, potatoes, peaches, capulins, walnuts, plums and apricots, mostly occurring only in the rainy season due to lack of irrigation. Livestock production is minimal but includes cattle, pigs and goats. However, employment in agriculture has diminished, similar to the situation in the rest of the state. As of 2009, there were 87 businesses dedicated to industry and handcrafts, employing just under 200 workers. Handcrafts are principally made by the Otomis, who sculpt sandstone, images from seeds and embroidered blouses. Commerce is the fastest growing sector because of urbanization with 196 units employing 377 workers as of 2009. The municipality has ten schools, eight public and two private. Seven of these serve preschool and primary school students. The average schooling of the population is 8.6 years, just under the state average of 8.8 for the state. History The name Ixtenco is from Nahuatl and means on the edge of water (or bank of river) . It is in this language and not Otomi because of the dominance of the Tlaxcallans in the late pre Hispanic period. The Otomis were the first to settle this area, although the date of their arrival is in dispute. Over time, this migration came in waves, mixed with Nahua migrations which began after the fall of Teotihuacan in the last Classic period. The population became mixed in the state but eventually the Nahuas became dominant. By the 14th century, the last waves of Otomi migration came to the area, fleeing the rising Aztec Empire in the Valleys of Mexico and Toluca. The Otomis managed to remain relatively dominant in the Ixtenco /Huamantla area, but as vassals of the Tlaxcallan dominion, receiving land in exchange for military service. These same Otomi people were some of the first to fight Hern√°n Cort√©s‚Äô initial incursion into central Mexico, and after defeat, allied with the Spanish to conquer the Aztecs . Ixtenco and the surrounding area was one of the first to receive evangelist Franciscans in 1529, with churches and monasteries quickly constructed. The town itself is said to have been founded on January 8, 1532 although a copy of the royal decree states 1534. The decree by Charles V names the founders as Diego Gabriel, Juan Ponce de Le√≥n, Francisco de Barba Torres y Paredes, Francisco Contreras and Antonio G√≥mez Fabi√°n, all conquistadors. Because of Tlaxcala's role in the conquest of the Aztec Empire, the Otomi of Ixtenco were able to avoid the establishment of encomiendas and some of the worst of Spanish abuse, although studies of human remains from that time indicated that the people still suffered from overwork and malnutrition. Unable to simply take possession of land, the Spanish began gaining access through private transactions, such as the purchase of land by Diego Mu√±oz Camargo and his indigenous wife Brigida de Contreras to form haciendas. Although converted, some pagan practices remained and were persecuted. One instance of this in Ixtenco was the case of Juan Co√°tl and his followers in 1665, who worshipped in a mountain cave which contained a spring. For the indigenous of the area, Co√°tl was a priest and the mountain sacred, intercessing for the inhabitants of Ixtenco and Huamantla for good crops and other favors. However, he and his followers were denounced by a Spaniard. They were forced to show the Spanish the location of the cave, then eventually hanged. During the colonial period, the area was governed as part of Huamantla, mostly as an Otomi area. These indigenous formed their own community in Ixtenco in 1681 called San Pedro Cuautla, just outside the main town, accounting for most of the population. While isolated both by geography and social caste, Ixtenco was officially expanded in 1695 and again in 1699, mostly to the north. By the mid 18th century, the Ixtenco area had 2 ranches and four haciendas: Rancho de San Bernardino y Rancho San Miguel, haciendas de San Crist√≥bal, San Jos√© Bautista, San Antonio and San Santiago. In the late colonial period, the town and area around it had disputes with neighbors over the use of regional natural resources, which had to be resolved by province authorities. At the start of the Mexican War of Independence, Ixtenco was still a dependency of Huamantla district. After the war, the state was reorganized can elections were held in 1823. The relative peace allows the haciendas to recover and grow. In 1836 the state was reorganized again but Ixtenco remained under Huamantla. In 1849, the town was divided into five neighborhoods, San Antonio, San Juan, San Gabriel, La Resurrecci√≥n and Santiago. Ixtenco became an independent municipality sometime during the Reform War, consisting of the town and the haciendas of San Antonio Cuamanala and San Crist√≥bal Jalapasco along with the San Miguel and Ixtenco ranches. However, in 1874, the municipalities of Zitlaltepec and Huamantla claimed adjoining lands, but unsuccessfully. Shortly before and during the Revolution, Francisco Bartolo Mendez was a major figure in the municipality, serving as municipal president and on the Agrarian Commission. He worked to return lands and natural resources to Ixtenco from the control of Huamantla. Just before the Mexican Revolution, there were several anti reelection groups active in this area against Porfirio D√≠az. The most important of these was the Partido Antirrelectionista Tlaxcalteca headed by Juan Cuamatzi. In 1910, this leader urged an armed uprising in San Bernardino Contla but was countered by an order from Aquiles Serdan in Puebla. Protests against the Diaz government continued here and elsewhere in Tlaxcala. After Diaz's resignation the Partido Antirrelectionista Tlaxalteca reorganized into the Constitucional Progresista. In 1916, the state was reorganized and the municipality became part of District II. In the 20th century, some industry came to Ixtenco but the major change was the area becoming a bedroom community for those working in Huamantla. However, much of its traditional way of life, farming, textiles and religion, have remained intact. Because of its relative isolation, it remains mostly Otomi in identity. In 1951, the clock was installed at the municipal palace. In 1976 the first deep well was drilled for potable water, with the second drilled in 1986.

The bar opened in 1968, and by the time of its permanent closing in November 2009, it was the oldest gay bar in Houston and one of the oldest in Texas. In 2011, OutSmart said that the bar \\"anchored\\" Houston's gay community in Montrose during its nearly forty-year history. Description In its early days, Mary's employed go-go boys, and originally featured a neon sign that read \\"Mary's Lounge\\" in the front of the building, which was gone by 1979. Early advertisements also referred to the bar as \\"Mary's, Naturally\\". Mary's included a jukebox and its bar tops were decorated with pictures of its patrons. Mary's also included a backyard patio and garden, known as the Outback, that had been planted in remembrance of HIV/AIDS victims; the profits from vegetables grown in this garden, along with drag queen tips, were often donated to charity. A statue of an angel, which had been there since the early days of the bar and which artist Steve Swoveland restored, stood inside Mary's and became a centerpiece for those paying their respects to the victims of the crisis. Mary's became a landmark and catered to virtually every aspect of the LGBT community. History =Opening= Mary's was opened in 1970 at the corner of Westheimer and Waugh Drive in the Montrose neighborhood of Houston, Texas. Montrose was at that time becoming a prominent gayborhood in Houston, and was the first gay bar to open on a main road, as well as to have windows. Joe Anthony had bought the property, which was a bar named Tommy's, and refurbished it into Mary's. Mary's was bought by Jim \\"Fanny\\" Farmer in 1970, with Cliff Owens becoming co- owner sometime in the late 1970s. In Mary's early days, it became tradition for patrons' underwear to be hung from the rafters, until the state health department required the bar to take them down in the late 1980s. Unlike other local gay bars, Mary's never adopted a dress code. The bar also adopted a cat mascot, which they named Mr. Balls, after he began living in the area around the bar and fell out of a tree outside. Mr. Balls was given his own bar stool at the main table. In 1978, the bar's license to sell alcohol was revoked by the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission due to continuous code violations, including the sale of alcohol to minors, but acquired it again shortly after by listing Farmer as a business partner instead of an owner. =June 20, 1980 police raid= At that time, police raids on gay bars were common. One well- known raid occurred in the early morning hours of June 20, 1980, as patrons celebrated Houston Gay Pride Week's third annual pre-opening celebration in Mary's ‚Äî for three consecutive years prior, police raids on gay bars in Montrose had been held the week before pride celebrations began, one of which was at Mary's in 1979. Some earlier and subsequent raids were actually marked as a pride week event, with customers showing up just to be a part of the raid. 1980's Houston Gay Pride Week was slated to be held from June 20 to June 29, and one scheduled event was a softball game between the Houston Police and Fire Departments and the Montrose Sports Association. According to the HPD, undercover agents had been sent to the bar after receiving civilian complaints of \\"lewd actions\\" and public intoxication. Agents had been inside the bar since about 10:30 p.m. and had witnessed \\"illegal activities\\". Shortly after midnight, at 12:05 a.m., the Houston Police Department and the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission entered the bar and arrested 61 people. Among those arrested were Farmer and the assistant manager, Andy Mills. Assistant Police Chief Tony Mitchell stated that the raid's timing with Gay Pride Week was unintentional, although the raid sparked complaints and accusations of police harassment from the LGBT community. Witnesses at the bar said police arrested people indiscriminately, and that the crowd considered starting a riot akin to Stonewall. Farmer stated that most of those who had been arrested were not drunk and complained of previous police harassment at Mary's, and Mills recalled having seen patrons lined up against the wall and loaded into a non- ventilated police van; another witness said some of those arrested were assaulted by police and \\"put in on top of one another.\\" News sources speculated that the TV cameras that arrived shortly after the raid began had been arranged or tipped off, and HPD Police Chief B.K. Johnson was not in Houston at the time of the raid. One news source, KPRC-TV, said the incident \\"damaged relations with the police and the gay community\\". =HIV/AIDS epidemic= During the HIV/AIDS epidemic, Mary's became an epicenter of fundraising efforts, as many of its oldest customers became victims. One of Houston's first HIV/AIDS advocacy groups, the KS/AIDS Foundation, was established at a meeting at Mary's. In its backyard, trees and shrubs were planted in memoriam of HIV/AIDS victims, and some deceased patrons had their ashes scattered there. Mary's also held memorial services for the bereaved, which numbered around 300. One estimate by bar regular John Paul Jones said patron deaths sometimes averaged three per month. When Farmer died of AIDS in 1991, Gaye Yancey and Terry Smith adopted his share of the bar. Farmer was cremated and his urn was buried in the back lot of Mary's, under a tree. =Closing= In 2002, Mary's closed for a brief time due to financial issues. However, the bar was able to stay open after it was purchased by Michael Gaitz. Its grand re-opening was held on January 12, 2003. Mary's closed permanently in November 2009 after a long decline in attendance and financial issues, at which point it was the oldest gay bar in Houston and one of the oldest in Texas. Mary's customers began a group on Facebook to attempt to salvage and preserve furniture and other parts of the bar; after Mary's closed, looters periodically broke into the bar and stole the remaining furnishings. The property was bought by owners of a newly-constructed neighboring restaurant, Anvil Bar & Refuge, in 2011. While a small shed at the back of the property was condemned and demolished, the back lot and main building were spared. The building was reopened in 2012 as a coffee shop named Blacksmith, while its back patio and lot were turned into a parking garage for neighboring businesses. The Gulf Coast Archive and Museum keeps a few Mary's artifacts on display. Murals Between 1990 and 1999, gay artist Scott Swoveland painted more than 500 scenes on the four-paneled Plexiglas front window once per week, portraying events, advertisements, tributes, and other scenes. Swoveland, who had been hired as a barback, was asked by the owner to paint the murals. His designs each took one full day to create. The Houston Police Department sometimes called in with complaints against his often suggestive designs. During the AIDS epidemic, Swoveland worked to create more jovial, upbeat memorials to combat the numerous deaths and memorial services within Houston's LGBT community. Other scenes on the outside walls portrayed Janis Joplin, a memorial to a former owner's German Shepherd, and a false window depicting the inside of the bar. His most famous mural was painted in 1997 on the outside east wall. This mural portrayed a scene inside Mary's with bar regulars, including Swoveland; the bar's cat mascot, Mr. Balls; and two anonymous gay lovers as the centerpiece. This mural became a landmark for the Houston LGBT community. In 2006, the east wall mural was painted over with a scene depicting a blue sky, but it was restored in 2011 by an effort led by local artist Cody Ledvina after Mary's closing. The effort used the image of the cat, the only part of the original mural to be preserved, and a projected image of the original mural to trace and paint the mural onto the wall. The mural was vandalized within 12 hours of being painted, but it was quickly restored.

Since its inception, it has leveraged tens of millions of dollars to support local micro-enterprise programs for low-income women and to reshape public policy. of During her time at the foundation, main initiatives included establishing a $17 million endowment in an organization that had none, and, beginning a 5-year, $50 million endowment campaign. In honor of her work, the Ms. Foundation created The Marie C. Wilson Leadership Fund. Take Our Daughters To Work Day In 1992, during her tenure as President of the Ms. Foundation, Wilson created Take Our Daughters To Work Day, which later became Take Our Daughters and Sons To Work Day. It has since been celebrated every year on the 4th Thursday in April by over 30 million children, parents, and schools, and has been adopted by over four million workplaces across the country. It has been one of the most successful public education campaigns in the nation, and participants in over 200 countries around the world plan for the annual event. The White House Project In 1998, while still at the Ms. Foundation, Wilson created the White House Project a national non-profit organization that aimed to advance women's leadership in all communities and sectors, up to the U.S. presidency. through training programs for women candidates and activists. In 2004, Wilson and the White House Project collaborated with Mattel and Toys \\"R\\" Us to create the Barbie for President doll to encourage girls to become leaders. During Wilson's time with the White House Project, she led a number of initiatives, including the launch of the Vote, Run, Lead initiative in 2004, launched the, which has successfully trained and empowered 15,000 of women to run for office and to vote. With offices in five cities, reaching 15 states, VRL was the largest political training program for women. In 2007, Wilson led in the creation of the first International Women Leaders Global Security Summit. The Summit brought together 70 female leaders from 36 countries. Wilson also formed the largest U.S. delegation to travel to Chile for the inauguration of Michelle Bachelet, the first freely elected female president in South America, and afterwards organized a 500-person event in D.C. introducing Bachelet to women leaders in the U.S., including Hillary Clinton, Sen. Susan Collins, and Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, among others. Awards and honors Wilson was named the Woman of the Year in 2013 by the YES WE CAN Center.

In 2013, al-Ahdal posted a YouTube video decrying child marriage and her being forced into marriage contracts, which quickly went viral and prompted coverage of Yemen's continued practice of child marriage. First marriage pact According to Nada al-Ahdal and her uncle Abdel Salam al-Ahdal, at 10 years 3 months old, she was to be married off to a wealthy expatriate. Her parents accepted money from the suitor, but her uncle told the man that al-Ahdal was not nearly modest enough for him in an effort to scare him away. Abdel stated \\"When I heard about the groom, I panicked. Nada was not even 11 years old; she was exactly 10 years and 3 months. I could not allow her to be married off and have her future destroyed.‚Äù Having the suitor lose interest, al-Ahdal continued to live with her parents but later left and fled to her uncle. At the time of the agreement, the suitor was 26 years old, 16 years older than al-Ahdal. The agreed amount for al-Ahdal was $2000. Second marriage pact In 2013, then at age 10, al-Ahdal uploaded a 2.5 minute video to YouTube which quickly went viral. In the video, al-Ahdal accused her parents of trying to get her married in exchange for money. The video was released with al-Ahdal speaking Arabic, but a YouTube user translated the video and uploaded it to YouTube with English captions. Reddit user Syd_G shared al-Ahdal's YouTube video on the site, prompting even more social media sharing. The video received over seven million views in three days. Al-Ahdal's sister had recently been married off at age 14, with al-Ahdal soon to be engaged at 12 to be married in the \\"near future\\". In the video, al-Ahdal started off by saying \\"It's true that I ran away from my family. I can't live with them anymore. Enough. I want to go live with my uncle. What about the innocence of childhood? What have the children done wrong? Why do you marry them off like that?\\" She continued, saying that she would rather die than be married off, citing lost educational opportunities, suicide among young brides and early death. She also talked about her aunt who was married off at age 14, who endured abuse by her much older husband before finally dousing herself in gasoline and setting herself on fire. Al-Ahdal ran away from home to escape the marriage and was quickly taken in by her uncle, a montage and graphics technician at a TV station. Controversy Many Middle East media outlets have decried al-Ahdal's claims as fabricated or a deception of Yemeni and Islamic custom. The Yemen Post has accused her of trying to ruin Yemeni and Islamic customs. The Arab magazine The Majalla claims that because of her uncle's media connections, he tried to exploit al-Ahdal by \\"turn[ing] the young school girl into Yemen‚Äôs new Nujood [Ali]\\" so that they will be able to abolish child marriage in Yemen. Al-Ahdal's parents stated that her claims were fabrications and that the video was scripted by her uncle. However, contrary to what her parents stated, Nada Al-Ahdal said they threatened to honor kill her if she refused the first marriage pact. Impact Al-Ahdal's claims have raised the discussion of child marriage in international media. Articles from across the globe are often citing the Human Rights Watch's research, which states that Yemen has no minimum age for marriage, and that about half of all women married in Yemen are married off as children. In an article about al-Ahdal, the International Political Forum stated \\"Some statistics can help put her story in context: According to the United Nations, one out of nine girls in developing countries will be married by age 15, and an estimated 14.2 million girls a year will probably become child brides in the next decade.\\" Al-Ahdal and the child marriage pacts have been covered in CNN, The Huffington Post, the BBC and many other media outlets. Reports of the incident by global media brought attention to the issue of child marriage. Works On December 3, 2015 The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Against Child Marriage was published by the Michel Lafon Company in French, co-written by al-Ahdal and Yemeni director Khadija al-Salami. The first version is in French, titled La ros√©e du matin. Another version in Polish is titled Jedenastoletnia zona. Al-Ahdal took part in the movie I Am Nojoom, Age 10 and Divorced. MBC 1 has produced a detailed investigative press of her story.

He also bore the French honorary title of a Chevalier d‚ÄôOr. In 1480, the elector enfeoffed him with the two castles of Berwartstein and Grafendahn which lay in the South Palatine part of the Wasgau region within the Palatinate Forest. In local folklore he is known as Hans Trapp or, more rarely, Hans Trott.  Family  Hans von Trotha was born into the aristocratic Trotha family who came from the area of the present-day county of Saalekreis, and was the fourth son of the Archbishop of Magdeburg's marshal, Thilo von Trotha. He was probably born in the mid-15th century in Krosigk (today in Saxony-Anhalt). His exact date of birth is not known, but he was the younger brother of Thilo von Trotha, the Bishop of Merseburg who was born in 1443. Hans only had one son, Christoph, who succeeded his father as the lord of Berwartstein Castle. Because Christoph had no male issue, the line was extinguished on his death in 1545 and the estate went to his son-in-law from the Alsatian House of Fleckenstein.  Life  = Expansion of Berwartstein Castle = The Berwartstein on the one side... ...and the \\"Little France\\" outwork on the other Grafendahn Castle As one of the younger sons of an aristocratic family, Hans entered the service of the electors and counts palatine of the Rhine in Heidelberg as a young man in the late 1470s. The link to Electoral Palatinate probably came about as a result of Archbishop John of Magdeburg, the patron of Bishop Thilo von Trotha. Hans clearly proved himself, because by 1480 the Elector, Philip the Sincere, who was about the same age, gave him the hereditary fiefs of two castles in the Wasgau on hereditary, namely Berwartstein, \\"including its belongings\\", and Grafendahn. Within four years, the Lord of Berwartstein had expanded it into a fortress, which was impregnable for its time. He achieved this inter alia by erecting the outwork of Little France (Burg Klein-Frankreich) in 1484 on the northern slope of the hill opposite, the Nestelberg. The site consisted primarily of a powerful battery tower on the platform of which, long-barreled culverins could be set up. This made it possible for an accurate crossfire to be brought to bear on any force attempting to besiege Berwartstein. Hans showed no interest, however, in the castle of Grafendahn, six kilometres to the north-west. It was probably already crumbling when he received it, certainly by 1500 it was described as \\"uninhabitable\\". The reason for its poor condition seemed to be that Grafendahn had been designed from the outset as a Ganerbenburg which had always had joint owners with no one person taking the responsibility for its maintenance. = Feud with Weissenburg Abbey = The old abbey church of Weissenburg Interior of the old abbey church Hans became well known as a result of his subsequent feud with Henry, Abbot of the Order of Benedictine monks at Weissenburg Abbey. The reason was that the Berwartstein and other property, the so-called \\"belongings\\", was originally the property of the monastery and, in the abbot's view, Electoral Palatinate had not acquired the castle legitimately because, in 1453, the monastery had only intended to place it under the protection of the Elector. When, in 1485, Hans finally demanded the \\"belongings\\" (i.e. the estate) of the castle, the abbot turned to the Elector for protection. However, the Elector did not support the monastery as expected; first he made excuses, then he elevated Hans to the rank of marshal and sold him the entire disputed possession. When the dispute with the monastery reached its peak, Hans had the nearby Wieslauter river dammed and so deprived the downstream town of Weissenburg (now French Wissembourg) of its water supply. The lord built the dam near the village of Bobenthal, five kilometres south of the Berwartstein. There, eight kilometers above Weissenburg, the little river flows through a narrow gap near the Bobenthaler Knopf (534 m, left of the Wieslauter on the Palatine side) and the D√ºrrenberg (520 m, on the right, on the Alsatian side). A small reservoir was formed, which flooded the water meadows in front of Bobenthal. Following complaints by the abbot, Hans tore down the dam as planned and caused a huge flood in Weissenburg that devastated the town economically. = Imperial ban and anathema = Baron von Trotha now engaged in open warfare against the abbot. When even the invocation of the Emperor could not persuade him to stop, the abbot turned in 1491 to Pope Innocent VIII. Eight years later, Hans was summoned to the papal court by Innocent's successor, Alexander VI, to be questioned about his loyalty to the Church. But he refused to go to Rome and, instead, wrote a letter to the Pope. In it, he emphasized his Christian faith on the one hand, but accused the Borgia Pope with obscure charges of immorality on the other. An anathema was then issued against Trotha which resulted in his excommunication. In order not to suffer the same fate, his former patron, the Elector renounced his vassal. In 1496, the Roman-German king and, later, Emperor Maximilian I also pronounced the imperial ban on von Trotha. However, the Elector only distanced himself from von Trotha publicly and sent him to the French royal court during the Italian Wars because of his diplomatic skills. It was whilst he was there that the French king, Louis XII awarded him the Chevalier d'Or knighthood. = Death and rehabilitation = Hans survived the sanctions of the Emperor and Pope and, two years later, after he had died in on 26 October 1503 at Berwartstein Castle of natural causes, they were posthumously lifted. The knight was interred in St. Anne's Chapel in Niederschlettenbach, four kilometres from Berwartstein above the confluence of the Erlenbach and the Wieslauter. In 1967 the von Trotha family had a memorial tablet placed in the chapel.  Significance  The events of von Trotha's feud with the abbey are depicted in the great hall of Berwartstein Castle. The hall is used as a restaurant that can seat 150 people, but it is open to the public to visit. Hans von Trotha, who was about 2 metres tall and even by today's standards would have been an imposing figure. became a local legend in the Palatinate region under the popular, corrupted name of \\"Hans Trapp\\", or occasionally \\"Hans Trott\\". He was not only described later as a robber baron, but over the course of time became portrayed as figure of terror for children who, as the \\"Black Knight\\" (schwarzer Ritter), was a restless spirit who stalked through the Wasgau at night. Even in the Legend of the Jungfernsprung his name was associated with the fiend who wanted to take the young maiden's virginity. The Christ Child and Hans Trapp in Alsace (1863 illustration) In neighbouring Alsace at the time of Saint Nicholas the name of Hans Trapp was used to frighten children and he was the one who accompanied the saint, not the usual figure of Knecht Ruprecht.Alemannische Wikipedia: Hans Trapp The appearance and dress of Hans Trapp (white beard, pointed hat and rod) are described in an Alemannic German poem from the Alsace: :::D‚Äôr Hans Trapp :::Schoi, do kummt d‚Äôr Hans Trapp. Ar het a scheni Zepfelkapp‚Äô Un a Bart wiss wie a Schimmel.

Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive Director Lawrence Rinder writes: \\"deSoto has explored a wide variety of media in his efforts to express the nuances of various social histories and worldwide cosmologies.\\" The majority of deSoto's work has been in the media of photography, sculpture, and installation. The San Jose Institute of Contemporary Art writes that \\"deSoto‚Äôs multimedia installations combine sound, light, video, space, and sculpture elements and are site-specific or oriented toward making a complete environment. His conceptual artwork utilizes automobiles, inflatables, electronics, photography, wood and metal construction.\\" DeSoto is based in Napa, California and New York City and has been a professor of photography at San Francisco State University since 1988. Background DeSoto grew up in San Bernardino, California and received a Master of Fine Arts from Claremont Graduate School in 1981 after receiving a BA in Studio Art with a minor in Religious Studies at the University of California, Riverside in 1978. The last name that de Soto shares with famed Spanish conquistador Hernando de Soto has been \\"a source of much confusion,\\" says the artist: \\"My heritage is vaguely linked to this ‚Äòexplorer.‚Äô Somehow my great grandfather, the Spaniard Terbosio De Soto, married into the Southern California Cahuilla tribe early in the 20th century.\\" Early work In the 2016 publication EMPIRE, deSoto writes that he began taking photographs of his model cars when he was ten years old; he later graduated to documenting the world around him using Polaroid and Minolta cameras handed down from his father. In Visions of America: Landscape as Metaphor in the Late Twentieth Century, Rebecca Solnit writes that \\"deSoto's oeuvre begins with Botanica (1980), a series of photographs of flowers that Solnit says \\"abandon the rules for landscape photography\\": Solnit posits that the delicate, blurry movements resulting from the slow exposure and flash of deSoto's camera suggest a mechanical analog to the natural beauty of their subject and reflect a process- and time-based emphasis on the \\"encounter\\" that would later inform deSoto's installation work. Subsequent projects such as Tahualtapa (1983-1988) began to draw more explicitly from deSoto's Cahuilla background. The series documents the gradual leveling of a mountain (called Tahualtapa in the Cahuilla language) in what is now called San Bernardino County through a series of photographs whose frames are filled with materials relating to the mountain's history such as feathers, marble, and cement. DeSoto also began transitioning from photography to installation via works such as the \\"Site Projects\\" (1980-1986), which combined large-scale manipulations and \\"non- destructive\\" interventions in the actual landscape reminiscent of Robert Smithson with long camera exposures documenting the temporal changes in each work. Installation works DeSoto's installation works have typically made extensive use of manipulated recorded sound, with an emphasis on using directional speakers and projected imagery to create an evocative environment. Nearly all of deSoto's installations‚Äîe.g. Tahquitz (1994) and Aviary (1990) -- incorporate strategically mounted and/or hidden speakers and amplification systems. In works such as Tahquitz, prerecorded sounds are played through the speakers; in other works, such as Aviary, the sound is generated by dynamic elements in the work's environment and then manipulated and reproduced by the amplification system. DeSoto's more sculptural works often also include a sonic element: for example, in 1999's Recumbent (Three Works), the artist placed speakers and a piezo sound generator inside a replica of a Spanish medieval suit of armor; his 2006 conceptual car Cahuilla incorporates an audio system that plays back casino sounds and Cahuilla chanting. In addition to works drawing from Catholic, Muslim, and Buddhist traditions, many of deSoto's installation works in the 1990s‚Äîsuch as Haypatak, Witness, Kansatsusha (1990) and Pe Tukmiyat, Pe Tukmiyat (Darkness, Darkness) (1991) at the San Jose Museum of Art‚Äîdrew heavily upon Cahuilla creation mythology. But while the light and sound effects generated could appear otherworldly, Solnit noted in 1994 that \\"increasingly, his installations rely upon quotidian objects -- most often, furniture and machines, the objects appropriate to rooms for living and making, rather than looking at.\\" She quotes deSoto's assertion that there is no word for sacredness in the Cahuilla language in support of the idea that his work asks questions about the possibility of locating the sacred in the everyday. This theme is also explored in deSoto's sculpture Paranirvana (Self- Portrait), which was included in the \\"Missing Peace: Artists Consider the Dalai Lama,\\" an exhibition of works \\"inspired by the life and message of the Dalai Lama\\" that has traveled since 2006 to major venues worldwide including UCLA's Fowler Museum, the Rubin Museum of Art in New York, the Nobel Museum in Stockholm, Fundacion Canal in Madrid, and the Frost Art Museum in Miami. The 25-foot-long inflatable cloth sculpture is based on a well known 12th century Buddha at the Gal Vihara in Polonnaruva, Sri Lanka‚Äîbut the Buddha's face has been replaced by the artist's own. Paranirvana was created after deSoto's father died; curator Susan Stoops writes that despite its majestic size, its depiction of the Buddha (and the artist himself) at the moment of death combine with the cyclical deflation and inflation of the sculpture to \\"underscore a sense of insubstantiality and impermanence.\\" In 1991 deSoto was one of five artists commissioned to create site-specific artworks at the former site of the Rose Theatre in Bankside, London; in the accompanying catalog, deSoto states that he aims for his installations to take the form of an \\"experience, rather than a representation of ideas,\\" and intends the work to take on its own \\"independent life...in time.\\" Works on paper, prints, and photography DeSoto \\"has created photographs, prints and tapestries in series and individually,\\" with emphasis in the field of photography, particularly landscape photography. His ongoing Appellation Series, for example, depicts wine-growing regions in California by digitally merging between 50 and 200 photographs into panoramic landscapes, some over eight feet in length. Like his installations, many of deSoto's works on paper consider the relation between cosmological or sacred themes and otherwise mundane objects, locations, or imagery. For example, the 2003 pigment print Pakhan-gyi presents a field of thousands of collaged pornographic images from the internet - a reference to the mythical temptation of Buddha by visions of beautiful women‚Äîfrom which likenesses of the Buddha's footprints (some of the earliest depictions of the Buddha in Pakhan-gyi, Myanmar) emerge or disappear depending on the viewer's distance from the work. In 2005's The Restoration, the artist staged a tableau vivant in the style of Johannes Vermeer's dramatic paintings but set in a contemporary garage, complete with a mechanic working on a vintage Pontiac Grand Prix. Conceptual cars Following La Cena Pasada (2002), where deSoto painted and arranged thirteen 1/24-scale miniature replica cars in a 're-enactment' of Leonardo da Vinci's fresco of the Last Supper, and Sound of the Trumpet (1996), in which a V8 engine was outfitted to generate an environment of shifting light and sound, deSoto's sculpture began turning toward the modification of full-scale automobiles. To date deSoto has created three conceptual car projects: Conquest (2004), Cahuilla (2006), and Imperial America (2008). These projects consist of vintage automobiles outfitted with what Nick Czap calls \\"meticulously deadpan\\" details and design elements. In a 2010 profile in the New York Times Auto section, Czap writes that the extensive and often symbolic modifications made to these cars transform them into \\"vehicles for exploring subjects from the acts of Spanish conquistadors to the empowerment of Native Americans to the military- industrial complex.\\" Czap writes that deSoto views his conceptual cars \\"as an extension of his work as an installation artist, describing the creation of installation art as a process of enhancing the 'performance' of an exhibition space.\\" In a 2011 interview deSoto says, \\"I think each car has a built-in opportunity for meaning, with some meanings needing to be more upfront than others. I view all the work as humorous in some way.\\" DeSoto's first conceptual car Conquest was re-made in such a subtle fashion that the artist presented it as a replica of a rare prototype at a Northern California Chrysler car show, where it won second prize. It was later shown at the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum in Connecticut, the de Young Museum's \\"High 5\\" exhibit, and the International Center for the Arts of the Americas as well as the diRosa Preserve in Napa, CA. Historian Eric Foner writes of Conquest: \\"This 'public sculpture' by the Native American artist Lewis DeSoto links his own surname with more than four centuries of American history.\\" In a 2006 essay about the No Reservations exhibition at the Aldrich Museum, Smithsonian National Museum curator Paul Chaat Smith writes of Conquest: \\"Lewis deSoto embraces the transgressive nature of No Reservations by building a car from a parallel universe.\\" In a 2005 documentary, The DeSoto Conquest, deSoto describes the genesis of the concept cars: ‚ÄúWell I‚Äôm hot-rodding spaces, I‚Äôm hot-rodding the notion of sculpture in various situations. Why not just go back to the hot-rod and start from there?‚Äô‚Äù Publications In 2016, a collection of photographs and essays by DeSoto titled EMPIRE was published by Heyday Books and the Robert and Frances Fullerton Museum of Art in San Bernardino. This book serves as a comprehensive collection of images from his Inland Empire project, a portion of which was exhibited at the Fullerton Museum from November 2015 to February 2016. The artist's Inland Empire project, a photographic survey of various California sites begun in 1979, includes both single-frame and panoramic images; while the exhibition included only panoramas, the book includes both. DeSoto writes that \\"the panoramas constitute a broad public exposure,\\" while the \\"single-frame images count as a kind of private view.\\" Exhibitions, collections and awards DeSoto has exhibited widely across the United States as well as in England, Italy, Mexico, Portugal, and Sweden; in 1997 he was commissioned to create an installation, Dervish, at Metronom in Barcelona. His work Paranirvana has been exhibited in numerous major museums worldwide since 2006 as part of the Missing Peace exhibition.

The company develops and markets a platform for analyzing consumer interactions with mobile applications, packages for marketers to advertise in-apps, as well as a service for applying monetization structures to mobile apps. Flurry analyzes 150 billion app sessions per month. The company's analytics platform tracks application sessions in iOS, Android, HTML5, and JavaME platforms. Flurry has raised a total of $65 million in funding since its founding and in March 2014 announced that it would partner with Research Now to create a panel database on mobile users. Flurry was acquired by Yahoo! on July 21, 2014 for somewhere between $200 and $300 million.How the Yahoo acquisition saved Flurry from an uncertain fate (exclusive) https://venturebeat.com/2014/07/29/how-the-yahoo-acquisition- saved-flurry-from-an-uncertain-fate-exclusive/Yahoo Buying Startup Flurry for More Than $300 Million https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-21/yahoo-acquiring-analytics- company-flurry-to-boost-mobile History Flurry was launched in 2005 by entrepreneur Sean Byrnes. It first started as a premium mobile applications company, that grew mostly in the developing world. As the team realized that it would be hard to monetize through advertising in these markets, they decided to pivot into a universal analytics platform that all mobile apps could use. The Flurry analytics and advertising platform really started to take off with the advent of the iPhone, which, with its own App Store, democratized the ability for developers to launch mobile applications and instantly reach millions of people. The revolutionary part about the App Store was that developers could keep 70% of the revenue (with the App Store taking 30%), and make money in unprecedented ways due to the consumer distribution of the App Store. Google soon followed with their own version of the App Store (initially called Android Market), and soon after Flurry became the de facto analytics platform for mobile apps. Flurry also merged with a company called Pinch Media based in New York that was working on a similar product, and together they had almost 80% marketshare for mobile analytics.  Services  = Flurry Analytics = Flurry Analytics enables users to analyze consumer behavior through data observations. The platform provides features for user segmentation, consumer funnels, and app portfolio analysis. The user segments can be categorized by things like paying versus non-paying customers or light versus heavy users. The platform's funnels measure customized consumer conversions and trending metrics, while the portfolio analytics feature allows companies to manage entire portfolios of mobile applications with the ability to monitor data about overlap among applications as well as up-sell and cross- sell conversions. = Flurry for Advertisers (formerly AppCircle) = Flurry utilizes data-sets gathered from its base of 1.3 billion monthly active devices to help brands and app marketers segment and reach their desired audience in apps. Flurry for Advertisers uses information about app behavior and preferences to segment consumers into behavioral categories, called Personas, that advertisers can then reach with relevant messages about other apps or brand advertisements. = Flurry for Publishers (formerly AppSpot) = Flurry for Publishers is a data-driven tool for generating advertising revenue through mobile applications. The monetization platform provides features such as ad serving, network mediation, targeting, and, among others, reporting.

He achieved renown and success with his psychoanalytic practice, which spanned five decades despite the fact that he expressed ambivalence and doubt about the field and his own work in it (Merkin, 2007). Wheelis died on June 14, 2007 at the age of 91 in a San Francisco hospital after receiving back surgery(Squatriglia, 2007). The Writer Allen Wheelis succeeded as a writer. Over a period of five decades, he crafted a series of novels while also writing a substantial body of wide- ranging works that has gone on to influence students and the educated public alike (Gabbard, 2000). He wrote prolifically, authoring 14 books including novels and memoirs, as well as several pieces for Commentary, the New Yorker, and various professional journals(Squatriglia, 2007). Many of Wheelis's writings have been acclaimed by critics. His writings are typified by a profound philosophical pessimism, and \\"drew heavily from his experiences as both a doctor and a man hobbled by neuroses\\"(Squatriglia, 2007). However, his wife Ilse Wheelis is not alone in pointing out that though Wheelis \\"had a pessimistic outlook on the human condition . . . he also celebrated it. He believed people could find happiness\\"(Squatriglia, 2007). Education Wheelis graduated from the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University in 1943, and was certified in Psychology. He served in the U.S. Navy as a medical officer in the South Pacific from 1943 to 1946. After World War II, he studied at the Menninger Foundation in Topeka, Kansas, and worked at the Austen Riggs Center in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. He underwent further training at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute before moving in 1954 to San Francisco, where he remained in private practice until his death.(Squatriglia, 2007). Influence A story that appeared in Wheelis's nonfiction book The Illusionless Man: Fantasies and Meditations on Disillusionment, published in 1966, was the basis of John Korty's film The Crazy-Quilt. Wheelis's essay \\"Spirit\\" was included in Douglas Hofstadter and Daniel Dennett's 1981 collection The Mind's I: Fantasies and Reflections on Self and Soul. In his book, How People Change: Freedom & Necessity, published in 1975, Wheelis describes in the detail a very defining story about his relationship with his father. The author states that these childhood events not only caused his writing but also what he writes and the conclusions he comes to. He sees in this the determinism he wants to destroy and asks how to get free of it. Quotes ‚ÄúOne can often recognize herd animals by their tendency to carry bibles‚Äù (Wheelis, 1966, p. 23). ‚ÄúThe sequence is suffering, insight, will, action, change‚Äù (Wheelis,1975, p. 8). \\"Desire is endless and unappeasable, is most intense where most forbidden, and is never far from despair‚Äù (Wheelis, 1975, p. 63). ‚ÄúWe must affirm freedom and responsibility without denying that we are the product of circumstance, and must affirm that we are the product of circumstance without denying that we have the freedom to transcend that causality to become something which could not even have been provisioned from the circumstances which shaped us‚Äù (Wheelis, 1975, p. 28).

He first gained prominence in 2001 when serving as the Guild President for Makerere University. He played a significant role in the \\"Save Mabira Riots\\" that took place in Uganda in the year 2007. Also, Mbidde played a noteworthy role in the 1994 liberation war of Rwanda. He is the Patron of the Mbidde Foundation and the reigning attorney general for Kooki chiefdom. Background Mukasa Mbidde was born in Masaka District on 15 October 1973 as the second born of the late Emmanuel Mbidde, a former headmaster and Ms. Mary Kintu, now a retired teacher. A Muganda by tribe, he was born in a Christian family of the Ente clan. Two of his siblings are Henry Mbidde and Balaam Mbidde both of whom are lecturers at Makerere University. He had some military training in the 1990s and played a noteworthy role in the 1994 liberation war of Rwanda when he fought alongside the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) before joining University in 1999. He has been his own boss over the years and has run businesses that include among others, The Financial Times newspaper (1999‚Äì2000), a Forex bureau (1999 to-date), a Radio Station in Rwanda, a law firm Mbidde & Co Advocates (2011 to-date), the Mbidde Foundation headquartered in Nagoya, Japan etc. He is friends with many Japanese and these have supported his programs for many years through the Mbidde Foundation. Education Mukasa Mbidde attended Nakyenyi Primary School, a school where his mother taught, for his primary education and Kabwoko High School for his middle school education. He attended Masuliita Boarding School and Kampala High School for his high school education. He attended Makerere University and Law Development Centre (LDC) for his higher education. He holds a Mass Communication degree (2003) from Makerere University, an LLB (2009) from Makerere University and a postgraduate Diploma in Legal Practice (Dip.Leg.Pract) (2010) from Law Development Centre. He also had leadership training at the Norwegian School of Leadership and Theology (HLT) in 2005. In 2014, Mbidde had a legal engagement in Practice in Sub-regional Courts at the Mandela Institute, University of the Witwatersrand. Junior political career Mukasa Mbidde began his involvement in politics in 1999 as a member of the Uganda Young Democrats (UYD), the junior wing of the Democratic Party. He served as the deputy treasurer for the party and then as the secretary for Students' Affairs. He stood for the Makerere University guild presidency in 2001 on the UYD ticket and won in all polling stations for a number of reasons. His predecessor was Asuman Basalirwa and his successor was Denis Okema. Why he won the guild presidency *Firstly, he had the finances since he was much older than his competitors at the time and had run a number of businesses prior to his tenure at Makerere university. *Secondly, he belonged to the correct group at the time. He was a member of a winning party (UYD). *Thirdly, his speeches were philosophical in nature because of his good background in literature and mass Communication, a course he was pursuing at the time. He won a Makerere University Certificate in The Art of Public Speaking. *Also, the girls voted him for his looks and the fact that they thought he was driving the best car at the university campus at the time. It was a red 1998 Saab 900 convertible. *Finally, his crosscutting nature made it impossible for students to know his exact tribe and hence voted him confusedly. Why he's the most noteworthy guild president of the 2000s *He advocated for and succeeded in the sponsorship of all female students with the automatic addition of 1.5 bonus points to every girl student upon admission. This created a balance between the number of girls admitted to Makerere University and that of boys who were the overwhelming majority before then. *He advocated for and succeeded in the creation of the Makerere University ICT Institute with the successful acquisition of the necessary funds from the Government of Norway. *Being a mass communication student, he started Campus FM, the Makerere University run radio station. Though that was noteworthy, Mukasa Mbidde is still bothered by the fact that his differences with the then editor in chief of The Makererean, the university run newspaper, made him the only guild president in the 2000s not to publish the university weekly in his reign. *There was no strike during his time as guild president because of his superb negotiation skills whenever there was a strike scare. *He created the Ministry for Private Students Affairs to handle the issues of the then neglected privately sponsored academicians. These were looked at as second class scholars at the time and so did not have the same privileges as Government sponsored students. The ministry helped change that perception in a positive way. *He improved the security situation by advocating for and succeeding in the removal of old fashioned hall of residence guards who were then using bows and arrows and replaced them with the current Makerere University Army that use guns and wear green uniform, the color of his political party. *To further improve security at the University, he advocated for and succeeded in the creation of a perimeter fence around the university campus. *He improved the sanitation issue at the University campus by replacing the then smelly and neglected gigantic garbage heap that was between Makerere University School of Law and CCE Complex Ladies Hall with the now famous Club Five, a student recreation facility at the university. The gigantic garbage heap was then a home for madmen, drunkards and rapists. *Mukasa Mbidde also started the annual Japan-Uganda Students Conference at Makerere University among others. It was against that background that: *He was given the title of Otak Olweny (meaning fighter) and the name Okello by the Acholi Makerere University Students Association (AMUSA) and the Acholi Sub- region elders. *Also, he received Japanese Recognition Awards from Chiba University and Soka University in 2002. *Finally, he won the 2001 American Council of Young Political Leaders (ACYPL) award, an accolade given to young political leaders annually by the American Council. Senior political career After his guild presidency, he went on to become the National UYD Vice President in 2005. In 2006, he became the National Deputy Campaigning Director for the senior wing of the Democratic Party. He was deputizing Norbert Mao at the time. He was a candidate in the 2007 parliamentary by- elections for Kalungu East county, Masaka district but lost in controversial circumstances and to-date still blames President Yoweri Museveni's involvement for the loss. He also stood in the 2011 parliamentary elections for the same constituency and lost but this time contentedly. Having failed to go to parliament in 2011, Mbidde saw a loophole in Uganda's East African Legislative Assembly (EALA) representation which then favored the ruling party, the National Resistance Movement, and so sought court redress and lobbied for the inclusion of more opposition party members. On succeeding in court, he was voted in on the DP ticket though in controversial circumstances and has been an EALA MP since June 2012. He serves on three EALA committees, the Committee on Communication, Trade and Investments, the Committee on Legal, Rules and Privileges and the Committee on Regional Affairs and Conflict Resolution. He is the chairperson of the Committee on Communication, Trade and Investments. He also heads the sub committee on legal, rules and privileges. Also, he is the head of the Speaker's legal board and the head of East African Sub- regional human rights practitioners. Bills tabled, supported or unsupported *In January 2013, Mbidde said he was to petition the EALA assembly to declare Museveni's actions in Uganda where he clashed with his parliament, incompatible with his status as the bloc's chair. President Museveni had been on the offensive at the time against parliament since the botched investigations into the death of Butaleja Woman MP Cerinah Nebanda who died under questionable circumstances on December 20, 2012. *In April 2013, Mbidde passed a motion in support of the proposal that SADC and the UN Security Council resolutions for an \\"offensive international peacekeeping force\\" against the M23 rebels be kept in abeyance to give dialogue a chance. *In June 2013, Mbidde stopped by petition the admission of South Sudan into the East African Community (EAC). He had earlier on been quoted saying \\"I am going to table the bill to block South Sudan from joining EAC if that country fails to adhere to my plea. The murder of innocent Ugandans cannot go on unchallenged.\\" *In March 2014, Mbidde successfully filed a petition before the East African Court of Justice seeking orders to stop anybody from drafting a motion to censure Margaret Zziwa, the EALA Speaker. *In March 2015, the Committee on Communication, Trade and Investments which is chaired by Mbidde passed a bill on elimination of non-tariff barriers, the EAC Elimination of Non-Tariff Barriers Bill, 2015. Legal career Mukasa Mbidde has been a practicing lawyer from 2011 to-date. He is a member of the Uganda Law Society, the East African Law Society, the Pan African Lawyers Union and the Coalition for an Effective African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights (African Court Coalition). He is a visiting lecturer at Soka University, Chiba University and Kyoritsu Women's University in Japan. He is a consultant for Kenya Human- rights Commission in Freedom of Movement. His specialty areas are the Law of Treaties, Corporate Financing, Mergers and Acquisitions as well as Conveyancing and Trademarks. He runs a private law firm in the names of Mbidde & Co Advocates and the Mbidde Foundation of which he is the patron is also a legal based NGO. He usually has joint instructions on high-profile cases with Justin Semuyaba of Semuyaba Yiga & Co Advocates. He has been the brain behind many of the cases filed by Uganda's Democratic Party, he being the Chief Legal Advisor of the political party. His practice of late has been inclined to Sub- regional courts especially the East African Court of Justice (EACJ), the highlight of this being his 2011 EALA case in the aforesaid court. Philanthropy Mukasa Mbidde is a philanthropist in Uganda. He sponsored elections of ten or so members of parliament in Uganda. He is a co-sponsor of the activities of Uganda's Democratic Party as well as the Catholic Church in Uganda. His passion for boxing has made him generous in his sponsoring of a number of boxing clubs in the country. Being a lawyer, he has often offered pro bono litigation to indigent clients and has often assisted diaspora members in land matters. Recently, Mbidde was recognized by KCCA for co- sponsoring the construction of a newly erected Kabaka monument at the historical Kabaka Njagala road junction in Mengo. Controversies Mukasa Mbidde has been involved in a number of controversies from his fighting alongside Kagame's Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) in the 1990s to his support of Margaret ZZiwa, the former EALA Speaker. His loss in the 2007 Kalungu East parliamentary elections came with allegations of vote rigging masterminded by President Yoweri Museveni as punishment for Mbidde's role in the 2007 Save Mabira Riots in Kampala in which two Ugandan men and an Indian man were killed and 40 Indians evacuated from a Hindu temple. Mukasa Mbidde also caused controversy when he supported Norbert Mao a non Muganda for the DP presidency and further is believed to have been instrumental to his coming into office of president for a political party that was founded on Buganda and Roman Catholic roots. His election to EALA was also punctuated by opposition strategic disagreements which led to the exclusion of FDC, the largest opposition party in Uganda's parliament. It is alleged that given his then filed new Application No4 of 2012 before the East African Court of Justice made the NRM, to have no alternative but to vote for Mbidde for the resultant effect of saving the elections from court nullification and this in the end worked to foil the FDC-led plot to boycott the elections. Personal details Mukasa Mbidde was married to the late Susan Namaganda, the former Woman MP for Bukomansimbi District, with whom he had three children. He is also a father to Gabrielle Mbidde. He is close friends with about six EALA MPs that include among others Dr. James Ndahiro and Dr. Abdu Karim Harelimana of Rwanda, Hafsa Mossi of Burundi, Peter Mutuku Mathuki of Kenya, Nyerere Charles Makongoro of Tanzania and Suzan Nakawuki of Uganda.

Background and education Annette Akroyd's father William Akroyd was a Unitarian industrialist associated with the establishment of the Bedford College, London in 1849, where she completed her study in 1863. Work in India Annette Akroyd with the students of Hindu Mahila Vidyalaya, 1875. In October 1872 she sailed for British India. Around 1875 she was involved in a public controversy with Keshub Chandra Sen, an Indian philosopher and social reformer who attempted to incorporate Christian theology within the framework of Hindu thought. Akroyd was shocked by her discussions with him and felt that Sen, who spoke up for women's education in England, was a typical Hindu obscurantist back home in India, trying to keep knowledge from the minds of women.David Kopf pg. 34-40 This dispute spilled into the native press and had its impact on the Bethune School. Akroyd was also dismayed with Sen's associates such as Bijoy Krishna Goswami, Aghore Nath Gupta and Gour Govinda Ray, who were traditionally Hindu in educational background and resisted the education of women. :\\"Mr. Sen had a strong prejudice against university education, in fact, against what is generally regarded as high education, of women. He objected to teaching them, for instance, such subjects as Mathematics, Philosophy and Science, whereas the advanced party positively wanted to give their daughters and sisters what is generally regarded as high education. They did not object to their university education and were not disposed to make much difference in point of education between men and women. There was no hope of compromise between two such extreme schools of thought, Accordingly, the radical party proceeded to start a separate female school of their own, called the Hindu Mahila Vidyalaya for the education of the adult young ladies belonging to their party. The successful manner in which they carried on the work of this school under Miss Akroyd, subsequently Mrs. Beveridge, attracted much public notice and was highly praised by the officers of Government. This school did excellent work for many years and was subsequently conducted under the name of the Banga Mahila Vidyalaya and was at last amalgamated with the Bethune College for ladies, to which it furnished some of its most distinguished students.\\"\\"History of the Brahmo Samaj\\" Sastri:1911:p.258 Translation Annette Beveridge translated the diaries of the first Mughal Emperor Babur, the Baburnama, publishing it in four books from 1912 to 1922.

The virus has many synonyms, such as SpV1-R8A2 B, Spiroplasma phage 1, and Spiroplasma virus 1, SpV1 (not to be confused with simply \\"SpV1\\" to refer to the entire spiroplasma virus morphological group 1). SpV1-R8A2 B infects Spiroplasma citri. Its host itself is a prokaryotic pathogen for citrus plants, causing Citrus stubborn disease.  Classification  The phage is a spiroplasmal virus of morphologic group 1 (SpV1), isolated from Spiroplasma citri strain R8A2 (SpV1-R8A2) subclone B (SpV1-R8A2 B). SpV1 viruses are classified by their naked rods.  History  = Documentation = SpV1 virus-like particles were initially observed by electron microscopy in 1973 during the first ultrastructural characterization of S. citri. Nearly two decades later, in 1990, the specific strain of SpV1-R8A2 B was first reported in the publication of its complete nucleotide sequence of its genome.Tidona C, Darai G. 2011. The Springer Index of Viruses. Springer. 749-753. = Derivation of Names = The prefixes for the family and genus are both derived from Greek: Ino is from nos, meaning \\"muscle filament,\\" and Plectro is from plektron, meaning \\"small stick.\\"King AMQ, Adams MJ, Lefkowitz EJ, Carstens EB. 2012. Virus Taxonomy: Classification and Nomenclature of Viruses: Ninth Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Elsevier. 375-383.  Virion  = Morphology = Group 1 spiroplasmal viruses are long, non-enveloped, filamentous (rod-shaped) particles containing a circular, ssDNA molecule of around 8 kilobases. The rods are nearly straight with one rounded end and one more variable end. Their lengths are about 300 nm or less and their diameters are about 15 nm with 4 ¬± 2 nm hollow cores. They also lack lipids. = Genome = SpV1-R8A2 B's complete genome contains 8273 nucleotides totaling 37.1% A, 8.1% C, 14.8% G, and 40% T. (UGA does not specify a stop codon in spiroplasmas; instead, the universal opal stop codon, UGA, codes for tryptophan.) It has 22.9% GC-content. Altogether, the phage has 12 coding sequences (CDS) and 12 genes.Browning GF, Citti C. 2014. Mollicutes: Molecular Biology and Pathogenesis. Horizon Scientific Press. 36-39. = Physiochemical and physical properties = Virions of SpV1 are sensitive to chloroform and ether. They are resistant to cold and heat, a wide range of pH, and non-ionic detergents (Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100). SpV1 buoyant densities are 1.39 g/cm3 in CsCl and 1.21 g/cm3 in metrizamide.Abedon ST. 2005. The Bacteriophages. Oxford University Press. 638-639.  Host  = Spiroplasma citri = Spiroplasma phages affect members of the genus Spiroplasma, which are part of the class Mollicutes, a group of small bacteria without cell walls. In particular, SpV1-R8A2 B infects S. citri, originally found on the Morocco strain. S. citri is the causative agent of Citrus stubborn disease on plants of the genus Citrus. = Infection = There is a high frequency of SpV1 natural infection found in Spiroplasma strains. An early electron microscopic study of negatively stained preparations revealed SpV1 particles in 38 of 67 Spiroplasma strains examined (57%). A single virus particle is sufficient enough to infect a host cell. Infection is nonlytic.  Integration  The S. citri chromosome contains CDS of plectrovirus prophages at multiple sites, often truncated, and many homologous to SpV1. There is evidence that shows, in the partially sequenced S. citri genome, at least 20.5% of CDS are phage-related, while 47.2% of CDS are of unknown function. These sequences of unknown function could be remnants of viral sequence insertions, a common feature with other Mollicute genomes, as they contain repeated clusters of genes that could be \\"mobile genetic elements or remnants of ancient phage attacks.\\" Insertion of the viral sequences occurs by encoded putative transposases resembling those of insertion elements. Integration of a plectrovirus genome can occur upon viral infection.  Resistance  Resistance has also been shown to occur with subsequent infection.  Consequences  Insertion sequence elements may have resulted in gene disruptions, genome rearrangements, and genome expansions.  Replication  = Life cycle via cytoplasmic replication = As a Plectrovirus, the phage's entry mechanism is adsorption to membrane-bound cellular receptors. Transcription takes place in the cytoplasm with a cellular enzyme transcriptase. Genome replication occurs within the cellular membrane in the cytoplasm. Host cell DNA-dependent DNA polymerase serves as the replicase, and replication occurs by rolling circle. Virion assembly takes place in the cellular membrane. The phage's exit mechanism is by extrusion. The typical replication cycle of Inoviridae:Hulo C, de Castro E, Masson P, Bougueleret L, Bairoch A, Xenarios I, Le Mercier P. 2011. ViralZone: a knowledge resource to understand virus diversity. Nucleic Acids Res. 39(Database issue):D576-82. # Viral g3p protein mediates pilus-mediated adsorption of the virus onto host cell. Pilus retraction pulls the virion to the host internal membrane. # The proteins of the capsid mediate the injection of the viral DNA through bacterial membranes into cell cytoplasm. # Host polymerase convert the (+)ssDNA viral genome into a covalently closed dsDNA called replicative form DNA (RF). # dsDNA transcription by host RNA polymerase gives rise to viral mRNAs. # Viral g2p protein nicks RF DNA strand at the origin of replication. # (+)strand replication occurs by rolling circle. # New (+)ssDNA genomes are converted into new RF molecules, and further transcription occurs. # When enough g5p protein is synthesized, conversion into RF dsDNA is inhibited, as neo-synthesized genomic ssDNA is covered with g5p. # g5p are replaced by g8p proteins to trigger the assembly of the viral capsid. # New virions are secreted from host cell. # Infected cells continue to divide and produce virions indefinitely. = Uses = The replicative form of SpV1 has been attempted to be used as a vector to express foreign genes in S. citri R8A2. The goal is to allow foreign genes to be transcribed, translated into proteins, and maintained in a stable form for generations. However, the recombinant viral DNA can prove to be unstable after passaging. SpV1-R8A2 B can be isolated from its host. The replicative form can be cloned in E. coli. Purification before culturing can be accomplished by CsCl density gradient centrifugation.

She is regarded as the mother or daughter of the Heavenly King and, in some myths, as the mother of all shamans. In other myths, the shamans are rather explained as descendants of Dangun. Relation to the shamans In a collection of myths, the origin of the shamans is linked to Sungmo, who is associated with a mountain and presented as either the mother or the spiritual daughter of the \\"Heavenly King\\". In some myths, she is a mortal princess who is later turned into a goddess. The investiture of the shamans, according to such myths, is believed to pass down through female lineage. These myths usually tell of a man, Pobu Hwasang, who encountered the \\"Holy Mother [of the Heavenly King]\\" on the top of a mountain. The Holy Mother then became a human being and married the man who met her, giving birth to eight girls, the first mudang. According to some scholars, this myth was first elaborated in the Silla period, when Buddhism and influences from China had already penetrated the Korean peninsula. The myth of the princess is the most popular, and it differs from region to region. In one of the versions, the princess is Ahwang Kongju of the Yao kingdom, located on the Asian mainland. The princess had a strong link with divinity, granting welfare to her people. Her father sent the princess among the people, whom began to worship her for her healing powers. The first mudang were established as her successors. The princess is worshipped with seasonal offerings in Chungcheong. The yellow and red clothes worn by the mudang are regarded as Ahwang Kongju's robes. In the north of the Korean peninsula the princess is known as Chil Kongju (the \\"Seventh Princess\\"), seventh amongst the daughters of the king. The myth tells that she was rejected by her father, who sealed her in a stone coffin and cast it into a pond, but she was rescued by a Dragon King sent by the Heavenly King, and ascended to the western sky becoming the goddess of healing waters. Names of the goddess in other local traditions Pali Kongju and Kongsim. In the tradition of Jeju Island, where there are more male baksu than female mudang, the myth tells of a prince as the ancestor of all shamans.

He resided in the Mount Gambier region for nearly fifty years prior to his death, living for many years at Glenburnie before moving to Mount Gambier itself several years before his death. In business, he worked as a commission agent, auctioneer and stock broker in Mount Gambier.

The injection of the toxin to treat strabismus, reported upon in 1981, is considered to be the first ever use of botulinum toxin for therapeutic purposes. Today, the injection of botulinum toxin into the muscles that surround the eyes is one of the available options in the management of strabismus. Other options for strabismus management are vision therapy and occlusion therapy, corrective glasses (or contact lenses) and prism glasses, and strabismus surgery. The effects that are due only to the toxin itself (including the side effects) generally wear off within 3 to 4 months. In contrast, improvements in alignment may be long-lasting, particularly in two circumstances. First, if the \\"antagonist\\" muscle (the muscle pulling in the opposite direction) is active, the injected muscle will be stretched, and may permanently lengthen by adding tissue during the period of toxin paresis. Second, if binocular vision has been achieved and stabilized, alignment may \\"lock in\\". There are indications that botulinum toxin therapy is as successful as strabismus surgery for patients with binocular vision and that it is less successful than surgery for those who have no binocular vision.  Principle  Botulinum toxin is the most acutely lethal toxin that is known. It is produced by the bacterium clostridium botulinum. It acts inside nerve terminals by decreasing the release of acetylcholine, blocking neuromuscular transmission and thereby causing flaccid muscular paralysis. As a result, the muscle is weakened for about 3 to 4 months. For treating strabismus, the toxin is used in much diluted form, and the injection is targeted to reach specific muscles that move the eye, thereby temporarily weakening the selected muscles.  Technique  = Injection = After local or general anaesthesia has been applied, the botulinum toxin is injected directly into the selected eye muscles using a specially designed needle electrode that is connected to an electromyography (EMG) apparatus as well as to a syringe containing the botulinum toxin solution., pages 559‚Äì565. In: Gunter K. von Noorden, Emilio C. Campos: Binocular Vision and Ocular Motility: Theory and Management of Strabismus , Sixth Edition. Ophthalmology Books & Manuals (Cyber Sight), Orbis International When under local anaesthesia, the patient is asked to move the eyes just before the toxin is injected. This results in an EMG signal which provides instant feedback on the correct placement of the needle. If the patient is a young child, general anaesthesia is always used. The duration of the intervention is one to two minutes if the person performing the procedure has sufficient experience. = Dosage = The dosage to be used cannot be determined with precision, as no reliable relation between dose and effect could be established so far. The toxicity of botulinum toxin varies from one lot to the next; furthermore, the body may show an immunoreaction by which the efficacy of subsequent treatments is reduced.  Clinical use  Botulinum toxin is considered as an alternative to surgery in certain clinical situations. A study performed in the 1980s found outcomes of surgery to be \\"more predictable and longer lasting\\" than those of botulinum toxin therapy. As stated in a review article of 2007, its use for strabismus \\"varies enormously in different cities and countries for no apparent reason.\\" In a small-scale study, adults whose reading difficulties due to convergence insufficiency had been unsuccessfully addressed by convergence exercises, base-in prism glasses or strabismus surgery showed improved reading after botulinum toxin therapy, maintaining improved reading remaining also after six months. = Use as primary therapy = Botulinum toxin is considered a useful alternative to surgery in particular cases, for example for persons unfit for general anaesthesia, in evolving or unstable clinical conditions, after unsuccessful surgery, or to provide short-term relief from diplopia. For patients who have had healthy vision heretofore until a small, horizontal deviation set in suddenly, the injection of botulinum toxin may allow them to maintain the binocular vision skills that had been acquired earlier. Some consider botulinum injections to be a treatment option for children with small- to moderate-angle infantile esotropia. Studies have provided indications that performing injections into both medial rectus muscles may be more effective than an injection into one medial rectus muscle alone. Botulinum toxin therapy has been reported to be similarly successful as strabismus surgery for patients with binocular vision and less successful than surgery for those who have no binocular vision. One study found that botulinum toxin therapy had similar long-term success rates for treating infantile esotropia with botulinum toxin A before the age of 12 months as would have been expected from strabismus surgery. Another study reported similar long- term success rates for infantile esotropia treated before 24 months of age by either strabismus surgery or botulinum toxin treatment. = Intra- and postoperational use = Botulinum toxin has also been used postoperatively for improving the alignment in patients with over- or undercorrection after strabismus surgery, leading to rapid elimination of postoperative diplopia but possibly requiring repeated injections or reoperation later on. It is considered particularly useful for patients who have the potential for binocular vision; success rates are higher for treating postoperative esotropia than for treating postoperative exotropia. It has also been employed in combination with strabismus surgery in cases in which there is a large horizontal eye deviation and eye muscle surgery on both eyes (binocular surgery) is not an option for other reasons.  Side effects  The most common side effects are droopy eyelids (ptosis) and over- or undercorrections; a further common side effects are diplopia and inadvertent vertical deviation (hypo- or hypertropia). The side effects typically resolve in 3‚Äì4 months. Vision-threatening complications are rare, and the intervention is generally considered safe, also when performed repeatedly.  Bupivacaine  It is also under investigation whether the injection of bupivacaine into extraocular muscles is of possible therapeutic use for treating some forms of strabismus, be it alone and in combination with botulinum toxin. Bupivacaine is a local anaesthetic known to cause considerable myotoxicity and neurotoxicity. Its injection into muscle tissue leads to a dramatic degeneration of muscle fibres accompanied by a moderate inflammatory response. It subsequently leads to a thickening and strengthening of the muscle. The thickening of bupivacaine- injected extraocular muscle has been demonstrated by means of magnetic resonance imaging and by means of ultrasonography. Bupivacaine injection is therefore being investigated as a further possibility of treating strabismus. In some interventions bupivacaine has been used alone. In others, a botulinum toxin injection into an extraocular muscle is accompanied by a bupivacaine injection into the antagonist muscle.  History  Alan B. Scott first injected botulinum toxin into extraocular muscles since the early 1970s and published his results 1981, giving rise to a wide scope of clinical research on the use of the toxin. The effect of bupivaine injection on extraocular muscles was first known as causing postsurgical strabismus as a complication of cataract surgery due to the myotoxicity of the local anaesthetic drug bupivaine when inadvertently injected into an extraocular muscle.

It is a Grade II* listed building, and scheduled monument. The cylindrical stone dovecote has a cone shaped roof. It contains over 300 nest boxes. The pigeons would have been domesticated for food, possibly by Montacute Priory or by the local lord of the manor. It is now owned by the National Trust and used as a store for the neighbouring farm. History The earliest written record of the dovecote was in 1393 although the exact date of construction is not known. It was attached to a mansion house which burnt down in 1875. The manor previously belonged to Montacute Priory, a Cluniac priory of the Benedictine order, founded between 1078 and 1102 although it is not known if the construction of the dovecote was undertaken by the priory or the Lovel family who later held the manor. Pigeons and doves were an important food source historically kept for their eggs, flesh (squab), and dung. The dovecote which forms part of the property of the Holnicote Estate, was donated to the National Trust by Sir Richard Thomas Dyke Acland, 15th Baronet in 1944. It was scheduled as an ancient monument in 1949 and designated as a Grade II* listed building in 1969. Repairs were undertaken to the dovecote in 1993. The building is used as a store by the neighbouring farmer. Architecture The building is cylindrical with an external diameter of and is high to the eaves. The walls, which are thick, are built of Devonian sandstone. The doorway was widened to its current height of high and wide in the 19th century replacing a much smaller door which would have been present when it was used as a dovecote. It contains over 300 nest holes. These are arranged into 11 tiers with an irregular pattern. Each of the boxes is approximately wide and wide but the opening is smaller than the interior of the box. The lowest boxes are about above the earth floor which kept them above the damp and away from brown rats which became common in the area in the 18th century. The original hole in the roof for the entry of the pigeons was covered by a flat stone and is now covered with glass to keep the interior dry. The interior of the roof has putlog holes rather than nesting boxes but may also have been used by pigeons.

The battle was the third largest Civil War battle in Kentucky and is considered important because it \\"blazed a trail for Union troops to move from Kentucky into Tennessee.\\" The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The bill would direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study to evaluate the significance of the Mill Springs Battlefield in Kentucky (relating to the Battle of Mill Springs fought on January 19, 1862, in Pulaski and Wayne Counties during the Civil War) and the feasibility of its inclusion in the National Park System (NPS). Requires such study, among other things, to analyze: (1) the effect of the Battlefield's designation as a unit of the NPS on existing commercial and recreational activities, energy production and transmission infrastructure, and the authority of state and local governments to manage those activities; and (2) the identification of any authorities, including condemnation, that will compel or permit the Secretary to influence or participate in local land use decisions (such as zoning) or place restrictions on non-federal lands if the Battlefield is designated as an NPS unit. Requires owners of private property adjacent to the Battlefield to be notified of the commencement and scope of this study. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources on October 30, 2013. This is a public domain source. H.R. 298 would direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study of the Mill Springs Battlefield in Kentucky to evaluate the national significance of the site and to determine the feasibility of designating the site as a unit of the National Park System. Based on information provided by the National Park Service and assuming the availability of appropriated funds, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that conducting the study would cost about $250,000 over the next three years. Enacting H.R. 298 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 298 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history H.R. 298 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on January 15, 2014 by Rep. Harold Rogers (R, KY-5). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Natural Resources and the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands and Environmental Regulation. On December 2, 2013, the bill was ordered reported (amended) by the committee, alongside House Report 113-280. The House passed the bill in a voice vote under a suspension of the rules on April 28, 2014. Debate and discussion Rep. Rogers, who introduced the bill, said that \\"the Battle of Mill Springs is a source of great pride and interest to the people I serve.\\" Rogers argued that the Battlefield was a \\"jewel\\" and would be \\"an excellent addition to the National Park Service.\\" The Department of the Interior, in a statement given at a subcommittee hearing, said that it \\"supports\\" the enactment, but believes that \\"priority should be given to the 28 previously authorized studies for potential units of the National Park System, potential new National Heritage Areas, and potential additions to the National Trails System and National Wild and Scenic Rivers System that have not yet been transmitted to the Congress.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress References * Hafendorfer, Kenneth A.

It was also named the 'Famine Church' because it was built during the recovery of the Irish population from the Great Irish Famine and was seen by the survivors as a sign of hope after the period of mass starvation.Mount St Mary's, \\"The Famine Church\\", Leeds from 28DaysLater.co.uk, retrieved 11 April 2014 =Construction= On 24 May 1853, the foundation stone of the church was laid by the Bishop of Beverley, John Briggs. The architect was Joseph Hansom.Leeds, Mount Saint Mary‚Äôs, 1851‚Äì1989 from Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate retrieved 11 April 2014 He also designed Plymouth Cathedral and the Church of St Walburge in Preston, both of which, like Mount St Mary's Church, are in the Gothic Revival style. In the same year, Mount Saint Mary's School was founded next door to the church. It was staffed by the Sisters Oblates of Mary Immaculate. They were housed in a nearby convent and also used the church as their place of worship. On 29 July 1857, the church was dedicated in a ceremony presided over by Bishop Briggs. The ceremony was notable, because in attendance were the Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman, his successor Henry Manning and the founder of the Oblates, Eug√®ne de Mazenod, who was made a saint in 1995. They processed through the city streets before having Mass in the church. The church was not complete; only the nave and side aisles were built.Mount St Mary's Church, Interior from Leodis: A Photographic Archive of Leeds, retrieved 11 April 2014 The chancel and transepts were designed by Edward Pugin, who was a partner in Joseph Hansom's architectural firm from 1862 to 1863. When the chancel and transepts were completed, the church in its entirety was opened on 13 September 1866. The main celebrant at the ceremony was the Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Manning. In 1916, a tower building fund was started to collect donations for the construction of a tower which was in the original church architectural plans. However, this was during the First World War and no tower was built. =Repairs= As the church sits on Richmond Hill, it is exposed to strong winds. In December 1894 and February 1962, the church was damaged and needed to be repaired. From the 1930s to the 1950s, the church was renovated. Major repairs and renovation also took place from 1980 to 1981. In 1953, during renovation work, an old coal mine was discovered underneath the church. A mine shaft, that could be accessed through the sacristy, was blocked off during the church's construction. Leeds Council had no records of the mine, but it did confirm a local suspicion that a nearby coal mine once existed. A study by Leeds City Council in August 2007 recorded that more than one mine exists, at three different levels, dating from the late 1600s to 1877. =Rehousing= From 1935 to 1950, much of the local population was moved to new houses in the Osmondthorpe area in east Leeds. This re-housing of population caused the parish of Mount St Mary's to halve in size before the Second World War. It went from 6,000 people to 3,000. After the Second World War it stood at 1,100 people. Postwar efforts to invite people back to the area did not succeed and by 1979, the parish population was 790 people. =Post-Vatican II= In 1953 the orphanage, that the sisters ran from 1853, closed. More than 3000 children passed through it during its existence. In June 1967, it was decided to build a new parish social centre for the church. On 18 October 1964, after the Second Vatican Council, a new English liturgy was introduced to the parish. On 11 April 1965 it was inaugurated and then said at all future Masses. In July 1971 a new altar was added to allow the priest to say Mass facing the congregation. In April 1978, a parish council was introduced. In the same year, Mount St Mary's School became a comprehensive. On 30 November 1986, the link between the church and the nearby Anglican church, St Saviour's, led to an official 'Covenant Declaration to Witness and Work Together'. This was signed by David Konstant, Roman Catholic Bishop of Leeds, and David Young, Anglican Bishop of Ripon. Architecture =Exterior= The church is an example of nineteenth-century Gothic Revival architecture. It has a brick exterior, and a steep slated roof similar to the main parts of St Walburge Church in Preston and Plymouth Cathedral, both by the same architect, Joseph Hansom. It has a tall nave and a semi-circular chancel. It is east facing with north and south transepts. Each transept has a rose window above three smaller lancet windows. There are gables above the windows over the aisles and above the polygonal apse, with Greek crosses carved into them. The tracery is decorated, including the large west window. It has geometric tracery with an arched doorway below. Included with the windows are hood moulds to stop rainwater hitting the stonework below. =Interior= Smashed altar There is one central aisle with two narrower ones on either side. There are columns, each supporting a Gothic arch, either side of the main aisle, six from the back to the chancel. From there, there are seven steps leading up to the sanctuary with two more columns until the bay-shaped sanctuary. The bay has three gothic arches around it, separating it from the back east side of the church. The altar is marble, but the top surface of it has been smashed into pieces since the church was closed. Around the altar are three sculptures set into the wall. The centre one depicts angels; the north side one depicts church leaders and saints; and the south side one depicts royalty, all kneeling towards an emblem of the Blessed Sacrament being crowned by the angels. In the north aisle, confessionals still remain. The floor in the nave is wooden, while the floor in the sanctuary is tiled. Some of the windows still survive in the church, because they have protective screens on them. They were by Hardman & Co.

This was also staffed by the Oblates. It was originally a wooden building, built next to the presbytery. In the early 1950s, it was burnt to the ground by a fire. In the 1960s, work started on the present church and it was opened in 1962. The Oblates served the Corpus Christi parish until 2008 when they handed it over to the Diocese of Leeds who continue to administer the church.The Story of Corpus Christi Parish from Newman Parish, retrieved 11 April 2014 In 2011, together with St Theresa of the Child Jesus Church in Cross Gates and St Gregory the Great Church in Swarcliffe, it became part of the Parish of Blessed John Henry Newman.Diocese of Leeds announces brutal programme of parish closures. Why is this happening? from The Daily Telegraph retrieved 11 April 2014 Closure With the parish population shrinking and the cost of maintaining the church increasing, the Oblates decided to withdraw from the parish. The bill of repairing the church was estimated to be ¬£1.5 million, which was considered to be too expensive for a church with a reduced congregation. In June 1989, the Oblates of Mary Immaculate handed over administration of the parish to the Diocese of Leeds. It was deconsecrated on the departure of the Oblates. Together they worked to sell the church and hoped that it would still be function in a different role for the local community. In 1996, it was sold to Sanctuary Housing Trust for a nominal amount. Since its sale it has remained unused. Scaffolding is visible around the church, showing that only essential repairs to make the building structurally safe have been carried out.Conservation appraisal from Leeds City Council retrieved 3 May 2014 It has been named by the Victorian Society as a heritage building at risk of disrepair.

The school's team currently competes in the Southeastern Conference. The basketball team plays its home games in Bud Walton Arena on the University of Arkansas campus under second-year head coach Mike Neighbors. History Women's basketball has been a part of the fabric of the University of Arkansas for almost a century. Teams of female students took to outdoor courts and peach baskets just after the turn of the century. While the women waited until 1976 for the first varsity team to officially represent the University, these early photos show how the game captured what was then deemed ‚Äúthe fairer sex‚Äù in action. Arkansas' women's basketball history can be definitively traced to the 1976-77 season when the University began keeping records. Since that time, the Razorback women's basketball team has made two SWAIAW Regional appearances, one AIAW Sweet 16 appearance, 8 NWIT and WNIT appearances, and 11 NCAA Tournament appearances including reaching the Final Four in 1998 and winning the WNIT in 1999, beating Wisconsin 67-64. http://www.arkansasrazorbacks.com/pdf/wbasketball/RecordBooks/1617%20WBB%20RECORD%20BOOK.pdf  SWC Title  Arkansas was the first team to beat Texas and the first team to win a share, then later an outright, Southwest Conference championship besides the Lady Longhorns. In 1991, Arkansas also ended the Texas‚Äô dominance of the SWC tournament by defeating Texas Tech for the title. These three trophies‚Äî the 1990 and 1991 regular season championships and 1991 SWC Classic tournament title‚Äîare the only women‚Äôs basketball trophies in captivity outside the state of Texas.  NCAA Final Four  In 1998, Arkansas made NCAA Tournament history as the lowest seed -- #9 in the West‚Äîto advance to the Final Four. They were the first unranked team in women‚Äôs basketball history during the modern era to reach the Final Four. And, they were the lowest finishing team in conference play‚Äîtied for sixth in the SEC‚Äîto reach the Final Four. Arkansas spent two weeks in the Bay Area. Along the way, the Razorbacks beat three conference champions‚ÄîWAC, Pacific, Ivy and ACC‚Äîand three ranked teams‚ÄîHawai‚Äôi, Kansas and Duke‚Äîto face conference rival Tennessee at Kansas City. Arkansas played all four of its pre-Final Four games on late night TV, earning the nickname of Good Morning America‚Äôs team. Every member of the team contributed to the run, starting with a 24-point effort by Karyn Karlin in the opening round win over #20 Hawai‚Äôi, 76-70. Then it was freshman Wendi Willits‚Äô turn with a near-NCAA record six three-pointers to blow open Arkansas‚Äô second round contest with Harvard, 82-64. In the opening round games held at Stanford, Calif., Christy Smith had zero turnovers and 16 assists. At the West Regionals in Oakland, junior Sytia Messer stepped to the front as Arkansas‚Äô leading scorer in both wins, earning herself the honor as the most outstanding player at the West Regional. Messer had 23 points as Arkansas used an impressive 54-point second half to dispatch Kansas, 79-63, in the Sweet 16. Fellow junior Treva Christensen announced herself with 14 points off the bench against Duke to earn all-tournament selection. Junior Tennille Adams was 6-of-9 with 14 off the bench including the go-ahead bucket in the closing minutes against Duke.

The Maha Vir Chakra is the second highest wartime gallantry award and is less in precedence only to the Param Vir Chakra. During the 1965 India-Pakistan War, Sqn Ldr A B Devayya (called 'Wings of Fire') was part of a strike mission (on the Pakistani airbase Sargodha) when he was attacked by an enemy aircraft. He shot down the enemy pursuer's plane but in the process his aircraft was damaged and he went missing. Presumably he died in Pakistani territory. 23 years later, in 1988, he was posthumously awarded the retrospective MVC award for this feat in the 1965 conflict. Biography Devayya was born on 24 December 1932, at Coorg, Karnataka. He was the son of Dr. Bopayya. In 1954 he was commissioned into the Indian Air Force as a pilot. During the outbreak of the 1965 war, he was an instructor at the Air Force Flying College. He was posted to No.1 \\"Tigers\\" Squadron and flew the Mystere IVa fighter bomber. As a senior flying instructor, Squadron Leader Devayya was part of an aircraft strike mission which went to Sargodha airfield in Pakistan. Despite actually being a standby in case one of the first 12 aircraft dropped out, he joined the air battle. Devayya was intercepted by a PAF F-104 Starfighter flown by Pakistani pilot Flt. Lt. Amjad Hussain. Devayya successfully evaded the Starfighter's attacks. But the faster aircraft caught up with him and damaged his plane. Yet Devayya attacked the Starfighter and struck it. The Starfighter went down while the pilot Hussain ejected from his seat and parachuted. It is not known what happened to Devayya. The IAF Mysteres were short on fuel and efficiency. The Mystere aircraft was destroyed and it is assumed that Devayya died on Pakistani soil. Aftermath The IAF was not aware of what had happened to Devayya, first recording him missing and later declaring him dead. Later, a British writer, John Fricker, was commissioned by the Pakistani Air Force to write an account of the war derived from Pakistani sources in 1979. What lead to Devayya's actual death still remains a mystery. It was revealed much later by Pakistan that Devayya's body was found almost intact by villagers not very far from Sargodha and buried. From Fricker's work, the IAF realised what had truly happened and in 1988 announced that the Maha Vir Chakra was to be awarded to Devayya posthumously. This is the only posthumous Maha Vir Chakra that the IAF has received. Mrs. Devayya accepted the posthumous Maha Vir Chakra awarded to her husband in 1988, nearly 23 years after the war. On 7 September 2009, the private bus stand circle in Madikeri in Kodagu was named after him.

Along with the Prairie Grass Trail it serves as the Madison County segment of the Ohio to Erie Trail. Bicyclists, hikers, runners, rollerbladers and other groups such as bird watchers and nature lovers have the opportunity to explore the natural beauty of Central Ohio as the trail weaves its way across the county. The entire length of the Roberts Pass Trail is part of U.S. Bicycle Route 50, an east-west route across Ohio connecting Indiana to West Virginia. History Roberts Pass was intended to be included as part of the Prairie Grass Trail. Due to the difficulty of getting right of way, it was thought this section would remain on country roads. As the result of herculean efforts of local volunteers, the right of way was secured and a work lane cleared for later construction. In a local campaign to rename this special section of trail; Bill Young, one of the original members of the Friends of Madison County Parks and Trails, coined the term ‚ÄúRoberts Pass‚Äù which were the last names of two of the organization‚Äôs leaders. On June 4, 2005 the House of Representatives of the 126th General Assembly of Ohio renamed that section Roberts Pass in honor of (and to the surprise of) Wayne Roberts and Gene Pass. A memorial plaque is mounted on a stone along the trail near Maple Street that briefly records this story. Location *West terminus at London: *East terminus west of Lilly Chapel (and west terminus of Camp Chase Trail): Route Roberts Pass is long between Maple Street in London and Wilson Road in eastern Madison County. The surface is asphalt and much of the trail has trees on both sides. To the west of Maple Street, the Ohio to Erie Trail follows a signed street route SW across London where it connects to the Prairie Grass Trail at Midway Street on the west side of London. Future Route The current signed street route through London is handy to find local amenities, however, it is the intentions of the City of London and local enthusiasts to eventually have an off-street route across London through the historical downtown area.

It is based on the Wired magazine article \\"La Vida Robot\\" by Joshua Davis, about the true story of a group of students from a mainly Latino high school, who won the first place over M.I.T. in the 2004 MATE ROV competition. The film was released by Lions Gate Entertainment on January 16, 2015. Plot In 2004, four Latino teenagers arrive at the Marine Advanced Technology Education Robotics Competition at the University of California, Santa Barbara (USCB); born in Mexico, raised in Phoenix, Arizona, where they attend an underfunded public high school. Oscar Vazquez goes to an American Forces Career Center to enlist into the U.S. Army; while he is waiting for his interview, he sees a video announcement and brochures about a Marine Underwater Robotics Competition, an event sponsored by NASA and the United States Armed Forces. Although he distinguishes himself as part of the Carl Hayden High School Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, he is forbidden to join because of his status as an undocumented immigrant; he is recommended not to present himself to any government office to avoid being reported to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. Vazquez lies to his mother about his progress in the Army; looking for another way to move ahead in life, he investigates the Underwater Robotics Competition. With no previous formal teaching experience and between jobs, Fredi Cameron interviews for a vacant substitute teacher position at Carl Hayden High School. The principal questions his job stability record, but eventually hires Cameron because of his PhD and engineer credentials. After the interview, while in the school's parking lot, Lorenzo Santillan overrides Cameron's car temperature safety sensor for $20 to avoid a more costly repair job. As part of his normal teaching responsibilities, Cameron is assigned to oversee an engineering club, where he meets Vazquez, who is looking for help to build a remotely operated underwater robot for the UCSB robotics competition. Cameron grudgingly accepts to help, even though he doesn't feel he is going to remain at the school for long. Vazquez, looking for more kids to join the engineering club, talks to teacher Gwen Kolinsky, who recommends Cristian Arcega. After agreeing to help, Arcega takes the technical lead of the project and sketches an early design of the potential robot. Before starting to build it, Cameron suggests a prototype so they can do a proof of concept model. Cameron starts to learn about the competition rules and requirements, which demands the robot to successfully complete a series of underwater tasks. Kolinsky offers to help teaching him about the PBASIC programming language, to implement the robot's intelligence module. After catching Santillan stealing from the principal's car, Cameron forces him to join the team and the now named Robotics Academic Club, so he can help with the mechanical design and building of the prototype. They later recruit Luis Aranda, for being strong enough to help lift the machine in and out of the pool. Because of a lack of funds to see the project through, the team starts looking for spare parts and asking for donations from the local businesses, which raise $663.53, plus $134.63 given by Cameron himself. The small budget forces them to scale back the original design and to innovate in how the robot is constructed, including the glue which gives the robot its name, \\"Stinky\\". Needing to go from Phoenix to Santa Barbara creates problems because three of the four boys were undocumented immigrants from Mexico. The day before the competition, they have to fix a critical electrical problem, due to a leak in the case that protected the intelligence module, by using tampons to contain the water. They face several highly funded college teams; the team from MIT is backed by a $10,000 grant from ExxonMobil. The Phoenix teenagers scraped together less than $1,000 and built their robot out of scavenged parts. Yet their robot finishes the practical segment of the competition in fourth place with 75 points after missing three tasks. They are still hopeful for a chance to make it into third place because 30% of the total score would be based on the judges' technical evaluation and interview of the teams. The night of the awards ceremony, they are given a Special Achievement award, which the team assumes is their final result. They are later surprised when they are announced as the champions of the event.

Much of the shooting of the film was done on location in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Reception =Box office= Spare Parts cost $3.6 million. The film opened in North America on January 16, 2015, earning $1.3 million on its opening weekend and finishing 17th at the box office. =Critical reception= Spare Parts received mixed reviews from the critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 53% based on 30 reviews. Many critics praised George Lopez' dramatic performance; Tom McCathry also praised George Lopez saying he really showed true acting talent playing the character like a real human. Lopez received critical acclaim for his performance with many critics calling it one of the best of his career. Differences between real life and film Although Spare Parts was based on real life events surrounding the formation and competition of a group of high school kids, there were creative liberties taken by the filmmakers in order to complete the story. In real life, the Explorer division of the competition was not dominated by private universities, as in the movie. In fact, its entrants consisted of four high schools (including Carl Hayden), four community colleges, two public universities, and MIT. Three of the teams depicted in the movie‚ÄîCornell, Virginia Tech, and Duke‚Äîdid not enter the 2004 MATE competition at all. They instead entered the 2004 RoboSub competition, where remote control was not allowed. All vehicles were required to be fully autonomous, navigating using sensors and software algorithms. In that competition, another team from MIT received first place, followed by Cornell in second. In addition, the students were led by teachers Fredi Lajvardi and Allan Cameron and not just one as depicted in the film. The teachers are not of Hispanic descent. Other media There is also a book with the same title () and a documentary named Underwater Dreams, that chronicle the story of the Carl Hayden team.

This version was either copied or translated by Englishman John Porter in 1583. This version was owned by artist Richard Cosway. Upon his death in the 1820s, it passed hands to a bookshop owned by John Denley, bought by an occultist named George W. Graham on behalf of a Magical organization known as \\"the Society of the Mercurii.\\" In the hands of the Mercurii, it came into the possession of Robert Cross Smith in 1822, who had John Palmer copy it. With Smith's death in 1832, the copy was passed on to Frederick Hockley. At some later date, Hockley acquired the first half of Porter's original manuscript, and attempted to compile both Porter's and Palmer's versions into a single version. Sloane MS 3824 (from the mid- seventeenth century) features a number of elements from the Book of the Office of SpiritsPorter, Hockley, Campbell, p. 59, 73 and is an early form of the Lemegeton.Rudd, Skinner & Rankine, p. 95 MS 3853 is titled The Office of Spirits, starts off nearly identical to more complete Porter version. Hockley's version, and some portions of the other known versions, were published in 2011 by Teitan Press as A Book of the Office of Spirits. The manuscript Hockley copied from was translated and edited by Daniel Harms and Joseph Peterson in 2015 as The Book of Oberon.  Contents  The manuscript in the Folger Shakespeare library is preceded by sundry materials lifted from Arbatel de magia veterum (amazingly only two years after its publication), the Enchiridion of Pope Leo III, and Sefer Raziel HaMalakh, and followed with a version of the Key of Solomon. The section Officium de spirittibus begins describing \\"the three devils\\" (Lucifer, Bell, and Satan), and the four kings of the air (Orience over the east, Paymon the west, Amaymon the north, and Egine the south), and the means of calling them. It then lists an additional seventy-five demons, for a total of eighty-two. Many of the demons are comparable to those in the Lesser Key of Solomon. The next to last entry, \\"Oberyon,\\" shifts the focus from demons to fairies. After the eighty-one demons, the book details Mycob (wife of Oberyon) and their seven daughters.Harms, Peterson, p.191-207 It then repeats the four kings of the air, listing twelve demons under each of them.Harms, Peterson, p.208-215 After this, it begins describing the spirits of the days of the week and the incenses and conjurations needed to summon them, lifting material from The Sworn Book of Honorius and Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa's Three Books of Occult Philosophy.Harms, Peterson, p.215-234 It follows with a list of Greek and Roman gods, a note about which spirits rule hell, and an entry to summon spirits \\"that make books and write books,\\"Harms, Peterson, p.234-235 before giving instructions on how to summon the angel over each day of the week, including instructions for magic circles, consecrations, use of holy water and exorcisms of fire. This portion uses elements of scripture, Sarum Missal, the Key of Solomon, Arbatel, Honorius, Agrippa, Raziel, and what would become the Tridentine Mass. It also shares some prayers found in the Munich Manual of Demonic Magic.Harms, Peterson, p.236-290, especially footnotes After this is a section on necromancy, involving magic circles and calling upon the aforementioned four kings, names of God, and different saints to constrain a called spirit.Harms, Peterson, p.290-319 The instructions on necromancy are followed by a means of finding hidden treasure that is similar to the method used by Edward Kelley, with spells to bind the spirit guarding the treasure.Harms, Peterson, p.319-339 Following this is yet another means of summoning King Egin,Harms, Peterson, p.340-345 and then similar instructions to summon a spirit named Baron, and a spell named \\"an experiment of Rome,\\" and spells to find lost items, steal items, see spirits (involving the invocation of King Arthur), and enchanting hazel rods.Harms, Peterson, p.346-364 These spells are interrupted by a short treatise on the role of angels, demons, and magic in theodicy, before continuing with more spells to see spirits,Harms, Peterson, p.364-369 a collection of talismans,Harms, Peterson, p.370-381 and a selection of names of God, planetary seals and spirits, geomantic figures, fumigations, and notes on the Lunar mansions openly taken from Agrippa.Harms, Peterson, p.382-387 Following this are more instructions on ritual magic, and more spells to acquire unspecified desired items, and identify thieves. The additional spirits in this section include: Bilgal, Annabath, Ascariell, Satan, Baron, Romulon, Mosacus, and Orobas.Harms, Peterson, p.388-453 The instructions on summoning spirits continue with Oberyon and his followers: Storax, Carmelyon, Severion, Caberyon, Aozol, Restun, Ramalath, Zaseres, Castriel, Saziel, and Ydial.Harms, Peterson, p.454-490 Hockley's manuscript starts with an initial list of eighty demons (with several duplicates),Porter, Hockley, Campbell, p.1-9Porter, Hockley, Campbell, p.10-19Porter, Hockley, Campbell, p.20-29 takes a small break to detail several fairies, and then lists four groups of twelve demons, most repeating spirits from the first eighty with various discrepancies.Porter, Hockley, Campbell, p.30-39 Sloane 3853 merely lists ten demons who also appear in Hockley's manuscript, and then names the demon kings of the north, south, east, and west (Egin, Amaymon, Oriens, and Paymon, respectively), generic spirits under them, and non- descript spirits to obtain love or treasure. Cherberus/Naberius appears with two other individual but sparsely detailed spirits (the first two over rhetoric and love, respectively, the last having no noted duties).Porter, Hockley, Campbell, p.70-77 Sloane 3824 lists different unsorted magical procedures, dropping names of spirits from the Book of Spirits in passing, rarely with explanation.Porter, Hockley, Campbell, p.59-69 = Demons shared by this and other grimoires = *Agaros, *Allogor or Algor (also in Sloane 3853) *Amaymon, *Amon, *Asmoday, *Astaroth, *Baall, *Barbaryes, Barbates, or Barbares (separate duplicate entries within the first eighty demons), later Barbais *Beelzebub, *Beliall *Berith, *Byleth, or Bileth *Caleos, *Cherberus (in Sloane 3853), *Coolor (also Doolas, duplicate entry), *Corsone, or Fersone *Darbas or Carbas, later Barbas or Corbas *Egine, Egin, or Egyn *Forcase, also Partas *Gemon or Gemyem *Gloolas or Glolas (in Sloane 3853) *Goorax *Hanar, *Lucifer, *Mallapar, or Mallapas *Orience or Oriens, *Oze *Paymon, *Ryall *Satan, *Saygane or Laygayne, or Zagayne *Semper *Usagoo, Vsagoo, or (with a different description) Vsago = Fairies = Obeyryon or Oberyon, an assistant spirit named Bilgall, Mycob or Myeob, and their seven daughters are listed as fairies. Obeyryon is listed as a king, who teaches physics, mineral and plant lore, as well as making men invisible, revealing hidden treasures and how to acquire them, and revealing past, present, and future events. Bilgall appears as a fire-breathing human-headed ox, though his duties are not detailed. Myeob is described as a crowned green-clad queen. Like her husband, she makes people invisible and reveals secrets about rocks, metals, and plants; in addition to medicine and \\"the truth.\\" The daughters, like their parents, teach physics and herbal knowledge, and give out rings of invisibility.

They all claim to not know where Holly is, so Will does a bit of research, and discovers that sorority girls have been vanishing in and around Grizzly Cove since at least the 1980s, news which shocks Barney, and Lang. Will tries to call Dan, but the police station's line has been sabotaged, leaving the town's only functioning telephones in the possession of Stella, and Mayor Carson. Will, Barney, and Lang travel to Stella's ranch, arriving just as the body of Veronica, who had been murdered with bees, is uncovered. Upon discovering that Stella's phone is dead, Will takes charge, sending Barney to Mayor Carson's house, and Lang to Kreeger, instructing the deputy to have Kreeger ferry her to someone who can get her in touch with Dan. Barney returns from Carson's house, claiming to have found the mayor's severed head there. He and Will then venture to the dock, where Lang is dead in the water, and the frightened Kreeger is fleeing the scene. The law enforcement duo go back to the ranch, and are unable to stop someone from hanging Stella. Everyone, minus the missing Kioko, gathers in the dining room, but they become separated due to panic caused by the power going out, and Kioko's corpse being found in the refrigerator. During the chaos, Sloan is set on fire, and burns to death. Elsewhere on Stella's property, Brooklyn stabs Jessie Lynn in the head. Following a bloody trail leading from Jessie Lynn's remains to a hidden chamber, Will finds Brooklyn and Barney tied up. Barney tricks Will into incapacitating himself with a bear trap, and releases and threatens Brooklyn into going after Paige and Aggo. Barney takes Will to the dock, and informs him that he is the one who has been murdering sorority girls over the past several decades, inspired to do so after helping cover up Stella's murder of her rival, who, unbeknownst to Barney and Stella, was the aunt of Brooklyn. Back at the ranch, Paige and Aggo (who is really a con man named Brian) are chased by the axe-wielding Brooklyn, who hates \\"sorority bitches\\" and was the one who hanged Stella. Paige fights Brooklyn, and strangles her. When Barney finishes gloating, Will grabs a speaker and presses it into Barney's chest, causing Barney's pacemaker to malfunction, and seemingly kill him. Will is joined by Paige and Brian, and together they ready Kreeger's boat to take them to aid. Will is content that everything is over, until he notices the bee stings on Paige's arm. Realizing that the detective is on to her, Paige knocks out Aggo, and throws Will overboard while claiming that she only intended to scare Veronica, not kill her. Will manages to knock Paige into the water, and drown her. Later, while using his precincts' washroom, Will is taunted and mocked by an obnoxious rival detective, who he gives a swirly just as Dan walks in. In a post-credits scene, Barney is shown recovering, and it is announced that \\"Detective Watts Returns in Bachelorette Party Massacre\\".

A 2/5 was given to the film by Staci Layne Wilson of Dread Central, who wrote, \\"Sorority Party Massacre is neither a comedic party nor is it a horror-style massacre. But it's not altogether bad. For me, the best thing was discovering a good actor I don't recall having seen before ‚Äì Keith Compton, whose performance is more nuanced than all the girls put together in a grinder. Some of the death scenes are inventive if, err, poorly executed (the low budget seriously hurts a script as ambitious as this)\\" and \\"If you've got nothing better to do, and especially if you're a dude who likes to watch scantily clad scream princesses prancing around, then perhaps Sorority Party Massacre is worth one peek\\". Similarly, in a review for Horror News, Dave Gammon concluded that it was \\"worth a look for fans of slasher fan fare\\" while giving it a 3/5. The Film Reel's Will Brownridge was highly critical of the picture, writing, \\"Sorority Party Massacre is little more than scantily clad women, running and screaming, and then dying in the least bloodless way possible. If not for Ed O'Ross as Sheriff Lumpkin, and Thomas Downey as Detective Watts, there would be very little to enjoy. Those two characters manage to be entertaining, and hilarious to watch. Towards the end of the film, the script starts getting filled with so many insane twists, that you'll be left rolling your eyes. The film makes for a great drunken night in, assuming you enjoy yelling at your television with friends, but beyond that, it's better avoided\\".

Created by writers Dwayne McDuffie and Robert L. Washington III, and artist John Paul Leon, Daisy first appeared in Static #4 (September 1993), one of the titles published by Milestone Comics, an imprint of DC Comics. After the closing of Milestone Comics, Daisy became part of DC's mainstream universe of characters. Publication history Daisy Watkins first appeared in Static #4 (September 1993) created by Dwayne McDuffie, Robert L. Washington III & John Paul Leon (artist). Fictional character biography =Milestone and DC Universes= Daisy Watkins is a smart but shy girl who attends Ernest Hemingway High School, where she's also friends with Frieda Goren, Rick Stone & Virgil Hawkins despite her shyness. Unbeknownst to Daisy and everyone else, Virgil Hawkins is also the superhero known as Static in secret.Static #4Static #5Static #6Static #8 Daisy once has feelings for Virgil and they date for a brief time, but Virgil's double-life as superhero 'Static' and the constant responsibilities that come with it interfere with their relationship, and it isn't long before Daisy gets tired of Virgil always missing their dates and breaking promises, so they both decide to break up.Static #10Static #11Static #13Static #19Static #20Static #21Static #25Static #26Static #27Static #29Static #30Static #32Static #35Static #40Static #41Static #42 Powers and abilities Daisy has no special powers of her own, she's just a high school student with a talent in science and math, and is an average human with average strength. In other media =Television= *Daisy appears on the TV series Static Shock as a part of the DCAU. This version of Daisy is less shy, more popular like her friend Frieda Goren, and a friend of Shenice Vale as well. She is intelligent, having attended the Vanmoor Institute, a school for gifted youth, but after Daisy's seniors are revealed to be criminals (taken down by Static) and therefore arrested, her parents put her in a safer public school which Virgil also attends. When she comes into contact with Static, she becomes infatuated with him, but he places her in dangerous situations several times; for example, in the episode \\"Consequences\\", the falling debris of a building (caused by a fight between Static and the villains Puff and Onyx) falls down on her, putting her in a coma, but she eventually recovers. Another example of this is in the crossover episode \\"Toys in the Hood\\" where she is kidnapped by a teacher, Ms. Moore, who is revealed to be an android named Darcy Mason, created by Superman's enemy Toyman. Daisy's \\"perfect\\" body is used as a template to create an artificial copy for \\"Moore\\" to use as a new body. Daisy is saved by Static and Superman. She also develops a relationship with Virgil Hawkins (not knowing his secret identity as Static) which becomes on again/off again because Virgil repeatedly cancels plans without warning and suddenly disappears when they are together; due to his responsibilities as Static, interfering with their time together and frustrating Daisy. Daisy was voiced by Crystal Scales.

Thackray began an apprenticeship in pharmacy at the Bradford firm of F. M. Rimmington & Son. He then went to work at the prestigious Squire & Son, Queen Victoria's official chemist's in the West End of London, and rounded off his education with a spell working on the Continent. He qualified as a pharmacist in 1899 and in 1902 opened a chemist shop in Great George Street, Leeds with his partner Henry Scurrah Wainwright. In 1903 Thackray married Helen Pearce, daughter of a leading Leeds jeweller. They lived in Roundhay, moving to bigger houses as business prospered. The company bought a sterilizer 1906 meant to develop another side to the business, supplying sterilized dressings to the Leeds General Infirmary, the nearby Women's and Children's Hospital and neighbouring nursing homes. The early years of the firm coincided with major advances in surgical techniques. Leeds was a centre of high-calibre surgeons, many of whom made their names at the Infirmary; best known was Berkeley Moynihan, 1st Baron Moynihan, who achieved worldwide recognition for his contribution to abdominal surgery. It was Moynihan who first suggested to Charles Thackray that he should make instruments; and the firm, with its experience in repairs at their premises just across the road, was well placed to do so. By 1914 Thackray's was employing 25 people, including eight instrument makers and three full-time representatives. Salesmen visited customers over a wide area, supplying wholesale pharmaceuticals not only to hospitals and nursing homes but also to general practitioners serving rural areas. The War Office's acceptance of Thackray's ‚ÄòAseptic‚Äô range as standard field dressings was important to the firm, both ensuring large contracts for drugs and sundries. By 1918 Thackray's employed fourteen instrument makers, out of a total workforce of 32. In the 1930s the firm began to make its own hospital sterilizers, operating tables and other items of theatre furniture. Charles Thackray died suddenly at the age of 57 in 1934. He failed to return from an evening walk in Roundhay Park near his home and later his body was recovered from Waterloo Lake. The firm continued to prosper as a limited company and in the 1950s acquired the British Cystoscope Co Ltd, in Clerkenwell, London, and Thomas Rudd Ltd of Sheffield, makers of surgical scissors. The company was a pioneer in manufacturing replacement hips, having collaborated with the \\"father\\" of modern hip replacement surgery, Sir John Charnley. Thackray began manufacturing the Charnley Hip System in 1963 and it is still the best selling cemented hip system in the world. The Thackray Medical Museum, founded by his grandson Paul Thackray is situated on the outskirts of Leeds in a Victorian workhouse building adjacent to St James's University Hospital.

He also served as curator for the Staatliche Graphische Sammlung in Munich.  Life  When he was a young child, he moved with his family to Nuremberg, where his father owned a wire braiding factory. Shortly thereafter, his father died, and Ferdinand's mother had to support the family by sewing. At the age of five, a guardian took him and his older brother to an orphanage, where they received vocational training. He went on to learn etching, lithography and map coloring at the firm of H. L. Petersen. From 1845 to 1848, he executed a series of watercolors for Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha: interior portraits of rooms at the various ducal residences in Coburg (Rosenau, Ehrenburg) and Gotha (, Winterpalais). In 1855, he moved to Munich and became a freelance book illustrator, publishing some of his own works directly, as well. He also studied painting, and produced many genre works with landscape or architectural backgrounds. His health was fragile, due to repeated haemorrhages, but he was able to live in Rome from 1860 to 1863, having received a scholarship from the \\"Martin von Wagner Foundation\\". While there, he worked as a librarian in addition to his painting. In 1871, he was hired as curator for the \\"K√∂niglichen Kupferstich- und Handzeichnungs-Cabinet\\" (Royal Engraving and Sketch Collection, now the Staatlische Graphische Sammlung) in Munich. While there, he strove to make the works of the old masters available to a wider audience. He developed severe asthma in 1885, which forced his retirement. After spending recovery time in several spas, he returned to painting and illustrating. Health permitting, he continued to take part in all the affairs of the Munich art community.

Her Native American name is Wak‚Äôamu (camas root), chosen because it represents a \\"stubborn plant that won‚Äôt let go of the earth\\", referring to the long periods of time she spent wandering the hills during her childhood. Pitt is primarily known for her sculpting and mixed media artistry, which focuses on 12,000 years of Native American history and tradition of the Columbia River region. Early life and education Pitt was born and grew up on the Warm Springs Reservation in 1944 and later moved to Portland, Oregon in the early 1960s after graduating from Madras High School. Due to a back issue, she decided to take art classes at Mount Hood Community College and practice designing ceramic masks in 1981. Some of her early influences included the sculptor and painter R.C. Gorman of the Navajo tribe and Japanese mask making and ceramic traditions such as Raku and Anagama. Career =Columbia River Iconography= Lillian Pitt is also known for her iconography, in which she works to identify ancestral Columbia River petroglyphs in order to affirm the indigenous presence in the region. Pitt is skilled in reanimating ancient images illustrated on rocks. And in the 1990s, she began experimenting with several mediums, including precious metals to create jewelry, bronze masks, and sculptures. She has also collaborated with the Pendleton Woolen Mills to create blankets representing the Columbia River legends and petroglyphs. In 2000, the Army Corps of Engineers commissioned her to create bronze plaques on petroglyph imagery for Columbia River tribal fishing sites, which were flooded by a dam. During the same year, she was awarded a fellowship from Portland‚Äôs Interstate Firehouse Cultural Center to create large-scale bronze sculptures. She had also started several public arts projects in the early 2000s, in collaboration with artists such as Rick Bartow of the Wiyot tribe, Gail Tremblay of the Onondaga/Miqmak tribe, and Elizabeth Woody of the Navajo/Warm Springs tribe, who is also her niece. Pitt is a significant partner of the Confluence Project, a collaborative effort of Pacific Northwest tribes that stretches 450 miles from near the mouth of the Columbia River to the confluence of the Clearwater and Snake River in Idaho. Renowned artist Maya Lin, civic groups from Washington and Oregon, and other artists, architects, and landscape designers have also participated. Pitt designed a Welcome Gate for the river side of the Land bridge that reachers oars inset with glass masks honoring Chinook women.  Exhibitions  * 1997 In Search of Self, Ft.

Grove Lime Kiln is a disused 19th century lime kiln on the Isle of Portland, Dorset, England. It is located close to HM Prison Portland and The Grove village. Owned by the prison service, the lime kiln has been Grade II Listed since 2009. The Grove Lime kiln is one of a few remaining lime kilns on the island. A 19th-century lime kiln at Easton Lane, now a residence, is another Grade Listed II example. Another kiln is found opposite, while at New Ground, another well-preserved example exists, but is hidden by undergrowth. Finally at Avalanche Road, within the Southwell village, remains another surviving kiln. History HM Prison Portland was established in 1848 to provide convict labour within the Admiralty Quarries, which produced the stone for the breakwaters of Portland Harbour. As part of the subsidiary operations within the quarries, Grove Lime kiln was used for lime production and dates from around 1900. It was constructed and operated by prisoners. In 1921, the prison was converted into a Borstal Institution and as a result, the quarry and associated masonry works closed. It is likely that the lime kiln also ceased at this time. The lime kiln has a rubble core and is faced with Portland stone. It was built against an enhanced bank with a charging ramp to the right side to facilitate the loading of the kiln with fuel and broken limestone. The design of the building has a tapering cylindrical form, with the charging ramp being more rectangular in plan. In 2009, the lime kiln was designated Grade II. Historic England commented that it remains a \\"well-preserved and distinctive feature of the lime industry and an important survival on Portland\\" and is of \\"special historic interest for its location and association with Portland quarries and the prison's use of convict labour during the 19th century and the early 20th century\\".

It is a right tributary of the Lauter, whose upper reaches are known as the Wieslauter.  Geography  = Course = The Moosbach rises at a height of in the central Wasgau in the region known as the Dahner Felsenland, southwest of the Kaletschkopf hill () in a woodland within the Moosbachtal Nature reserve. Its source is a spring called the Moosbrunnen. It initially presses northwards through a narrow, wooded valley between the Red Rock (Roten Felsen) on the left and the Kaletschkopf on the right. At the Moosbach-Halde it changes direction to run northeast and then fills a small pond south of the Moosbachh√ºtte hut and shortly thereafter the rather larger and very scenic pond of Kranzwoog. Very gradually it turns towards the east. It runs along the southern slopes of the Lehmberg (). South of the Wolfdell it passes through two more small ponds in succession and its then fed from the right by the Seibertsbach stream coming from the south. About downstream the Moosbach bends to the left and now flows in a northerly direction west of the Mehrsberg (). Shortly afterwards it passes through the Neudahner Weiher, which lies on the southeastern slopes of the S√§gk√∂pfchen (). To the east, not far from this lake, rises Neudahn Castle. The Moosbach empties from the right into the Wieslauter at a height of . = Tributaries = * Seibertsbach (right), 4.2 km  Biosphere  The nature reserve of Moosbachtal ist 111 hectares in area. Its calcareous grassland, wet meadows, intermediate bogs, dystrophic ponds with siltation zones, springs, streams, bushes and woods offer a multitude of species their own habitat, so that it forms one of the most important reserves in S√ºdwestpfalz. = Flora = Alder grows in the carrs in the valley, albeit threatened at times by spruce and beech, and in the wet meadows deer fern, milk parsley, yellow flag and marsh marigold thrive. Cranberries, bog pondweed, tussock sedge, bogbean, cottongrass, water lilies, marsh gentian and bog arum also grow richly here. One feature of the valley is the occurrence of the fungi, alder bracket and lilac milk cap. = Fauna = Grass snakes, Alpine newts, Common toads and Common frogs occur in the carrs, and great spotted woodpeckers and red-backed shrike may also be seen there. Dragonflies and damselflies thrive greatly on the brown water ponds; a total of 37 different species have been identified in the valley, including the blue hawker. Other insects living in the valley include the stag beetle, der swallowtail and the large marsh grasshopper.  Geology  Geologically the valley is characterised by depositions of bunter sandstone, which is overlain in places by marsh from the Cenozoic. Occasionally, black peat occurs here.  Tourism  Through the Moosbach valley run several walks, such as the Water Lily Tour (Seerosentour). A campsite at the Neudahner Weiher offers the opportunity to camp in the middle of the Palatine Forest. The valley has recently been opened up by the establishment of the eponymous railway halt of Moosbachtal on the .

Traditionally, he was recognised as the first person to make practical experiments with steam to propel a vessel; but evidence to substantiate the claim that he did more than propose a steam vessel on paper is lacking. Life Hulls was born at Hanging Aston, Gloucestershire. It has been suggested that the background to the efforts of Hulls was the 1734 publication in the abridged Philosophical Transactions of a paper by the French engineer Monsieur Duquet on ships and mechanical propulsion. Duquet was a controversialist also active at that time in a debate on his ideas with Henri Pitot. He died in the middle of 1758 in Broad Campden, where he had lived almost all his adult life. Work Hulls' 1736 proposal for a paddle-tug The protection of his invention by Hulls depended on the financial support of his neighbour named Freeman at Batsford Park. The patent for the invention by Hulls is dated 21 December 1736, and his account of it appeared as Description and Draught of a new-invented Machine for carrying Vessels or Ships out of or into any Harbour, Port, or River against Wind and Tide, or in a Calm; for which his Majesty has granted Letters-patent for the sole benefit of the Author for the space of fourteen years (London, 1737). It was reprinted in facsimile in 1855. A Newcomen engine was to be set up on a tow-boat in front of another vessel, connected by a tow-rope. Six paddles in the stern of the tow-boat were to be fastened to a cross axis connected by ropes to another axis which was turned by the engine. Hulls showed how to convert the rectilineal motion of a piston-rod into a rotatory motion. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography casts doubt on the traditional story about practical trials by Hulls. The Dictionary of National Biography first edition related that they were made on River Avon at Evesham in 1737; that they were a failure; and that Hulls was the butt of humour. In 1754 Hulls published The Art of Measuring made Easy by the help of a new Sliding Scale; he also wrote the Maltmakers' Instructor. Influence Augustus De Morgan says that Hulls's work very likely gave suggestions to William Symington; and that Erasmus Darwin was thinking of Hulls when he prophesied that steam would soon \\"drag the slow barge\\".

In 1972, he moved to Paris with his dance partner and lifelong companion Hawaiian-born Earnest Morgan. In his memoir, Koob wrote of an exciting, and often hectic, life touring as a professional dancer. At first he and Morgan performed in New York, and later in Paris, and elsewhere in Europe and Asia, including Leningrad, Morocco, and throughout France, with a grand finale at the annual arts festival in Avignon. He wrote of contrasts between the hectic life of performing in New York and Paris and evening walks in the countryside of Southern France, where it was \\"so easy to breath the joie de vivre and forget that there might be any destination or goal beyond just being itself\\".Koob, Richard. 2002. Kalani: a leap of faith, hope and love. Kalani Publications, accessed 12-April-2014.Kalani. 2014. Earnest Morgan Arts eXuberance pavilion. Kalani Website, accessed 12-April-2014. While living in southern France, Koob and Morgan conceived of developing a retreat center in an old monastery where they \\"could take a centuries long tradition and give it a modern twist to celebrate the arts, nature, health and spirit\\". After \\"a couple bouts in Paris with bureaucracy and gendarmes\\", Koob and Morgan decided to move to Hawaii to pursue their dream of a retreat center. Koob reflected: After ten years touring the western world as professional dancers and patrons of the arts, in 1973 Koob and his companion Morgan moved to Hawai'i, settling in Honolulu on Oahu, as well as living part-time in Hilo and rural Puna on the Big Island of Hawai'i. He helped Morgan found, manage, and fund Dance O Hawai'i, which performed throughout the Islands' communities and schools, as well as in the Asia Pacific region. While completing his MFA, he also performed with the Honolulu Ballet, directed by Morgan, and with other dance companies.Tsutsumi, Cheryl Chee. 2011. Puna's rich, abundant resources figure in rejuvenating retreat. Honolulu Star Advertiser. October 2, 2011. = Building Kalani Retreat Center = Koob and Morgan began building a retreat center focused on self-development and education. In 1975, with help from Koob's family, they purchased the original Kalani Honua property, now expanded to include the Kalani Kai and Kalani Mauka parcels. The 1982 grand opening of Kalani was described by the Island's newspaper as \\"the best party ever in Puna\\" (an event now eclipsed by the Kalani-organized Puna Music Festival, which attracts over 6,000 attendees).County of Hawaii. 2013. Annual Report FY 2012-2013: preserving our heritage, preparing for our future, accessed 11-April-2014. In 1992, Morgan died of complications of AIDS. According to Koob, \\"Earnest inspired an enduring creativity and love in all his relations\\". Koob continued their work building Kalani Oceanside Retreat, now the largest and oldest retreat center in Hawai'i. He furthered the legacy of Kalani's co-founder by dedicating a large studio ‚Äì popular for weekly classes, ecstatic dances, and community gatherings ‚Äì the Earnest Morgan Arts eXuberance (EMAX) pavilion.\\"Richard Koob retires after 38 years of community service\\".

Kalani mission and nonprofit information. Kalani Website, accessed 12-April-2014. Kalani is built on Koob's concept of \\"social enterprise\\", where non-profits apply market strategies to achieve social purpose: \\"Our goal has never been profit or gain. Our goal was to create a space where people‚Äôs lives could transform, and that has extended into the surrounding district with our community programs.\\" Kalani sponsors an extensive Community Arts Program, with more than 50 offerings per week, typically free to the public or by donation, including offerings of yoga, Hawaiian culture, dance and performing arts, wellness, and personal growth.

The purpose of this organization was to create a strong leadership to lead the student movement.Ling Chai, A Heart for Freedom. Illinois: Tyndale House, 2011 . 159. Structure Defend Tiananmen Square Headquarters was set up by a small group of people. More than half of the organizations were famous student leaders of 1989 student protests. Chai Ling was prominent as commander-in-chief for the Square.Ling Chai, A Heart for Freedom, 160. There were six other key members in this organization, but not all of them were in charge of the group's decision making in the organization, Li Lu, Feng Congde, Zhang Boli, Wang Dan and Wang Chaohua were elected deputy commanders and Guo Haifeng was the secretary-general.Renhua Wu, Major Events, Tiananmen 1989. Renhua Wu, 2011. . In order to form this organization Zhang Boli and Feng Congde had to take a huge risk by returned from their safe houses. They became two very important key members of the team, along with Li Lu. (4) Even though Wang Dan was one of the deputy commanders, he was hardly involved in decision making. Shortly after the Defend Tiananmen Square Headquarters was formed, Wang Chaohua left the organization and announced his resignation due to their differences in decision making. Oath At 10:00 a.m. on May 24, 1989. Chai Ling led the formation of crowd in the annunciation of the following oath on the Tiananmen Square: \\"I swear I will protect the republic and Tiananmen Square with my young life. Heads can roll, blood can flow, but the people's Square can never be lost! We are willing to fight to the last person.\\" According to Chai Ling's book A Heart for Freedom: The Remarkable Journey of a Young Dissident, her Daring Escape, and her Quest to Free China's Daughters, and Wu Renhua's book Major Events, Tiananmen 1989 at least one hundred thousand people gathered in the Square when Chai Ling took the oath. And some people joined them after Wang Dan announced the formation of the Defend Tiananmen Square Headquarters. Actions Defend Tiananmen Square Headquarters established a variety of measures to protect students protesting in Tiananmen Square. Their first was the installation of a broadcasting system for establishing authority and issuing instructions to protestors. The system was used for a final time on June 3 to report the first acts of violence occurring on the square‚Äôs surrounding streets, and to prompt the Hunger Strikers to remain passive. The system‚Äôs use quickly expanded beyond its original purpose. In his memoir, Li Lu notes that early on June 3 the system was used to pacify agitated students by playing Beethoven, with the intent of preventing a violent outbreak among the students. The headquarters also chose to dedicate two hours of airtime per day to a free forum, during which any person could broadcast their thoughts to the masses. On Children‚Äôs Day, the scope of the broadcasting system was further expanded to broadcast the headquarters‚Äô message of democracy to the children with the assumption that they would continue the movement once they entered university. Despite these usages, the students‚Äô loudspeakers were low powered, and easily drowned out by government speakers. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), however, stated that the students in general installed the loudspeakers illegally, and that a small minority utilized them to attack Party and state leaders, disseminate counterrevolutionary propaganda, and promote overthrowing the CCP. In order to fulfill its defence mandate, the Headquarters established a system of pickets (road blockades) and student marshals to control the streets surrounding the square. Scholar Andrew Scobell agrees with Li Lu that student pickets were effective until June 3 in keeping the People‚Äôs Liberation Army (PLA) at bay; as between May 23 and June 3 the troops were ordered not to move on the unarmed students. Once authorized to use force, the PLA broke through student pickets and entered the square, demonstrating the inability of the pickets to resist the army. Once the crackdown began, the responsibilities of the pickets widened to include maintaining order during the square‚Äôs evacuation, as well as physically protecting the Defend Tiananmen Square Headquarters leaders, which facilitated the escape of Chai Ling, Feng Congde, Li Lu, and Wang Chaohua. Attempting to exercise effective authority, the Headquarters established a central location so that they could create security lines and be found easily. It is important to note that the intended use of these security lines differs between the English and Mandarin versions of Chai Ling‚Äôs memoir. Her Mandarin version notes that the lines are intended to protect students, whereas the English version states they are for the protection of the leaders. Considering the English version of her memoir, Chai Ling states that physically strong students were chosen for security roles, such as the Maritime College cadres tasked with protecting the broadcast building. Many of these guards, however, chose to abandon their posts, claiming a lack of effective leadership and tangible results as their reason. To facilitate the security of the Headquarters itself, the student leaders only issued identification passes and established a double line of student guards. The limited effectiveness of these security measures was demonstrated when, on the morning of June 1, Chai Ling and Feng Congde fell victim to an attempted kidnapping by Wu Lai, in which Headquarters guards took an hour to arrive at the scene. The kidnapping was halted, however, once Li Lu confronted Wu, whereupon Wu fled. Considering Chai‚Äôs Mandarin version, security lines were only established around the Headquarters and its associated structures with leaders, not around the entirety of the square with the masses. The student leaders also expressed limited confidence in their security system. Following May 30, student leaders fully expected the PLA to break their security lines in the near future, intending to arrest and kill some of them. The first half of this belief would come true, but the guards performed their intended task during the evacuation from the square, in which they surrounded their leaders and facilitated a safe evacuation. To better provide food to protesting students, who were only being fed one piece of bread per day, the Headquarters established its own donation fund. The fund received some sizeable donations from Chinese Central Television, the private sector, and others. Notably, a Hong Kong concert raised one million US dollars for the students. However, since the various student organizations within the square maintained their own donation funds, accountability waned. For example, the Beijing Students‚Äô Autonomous Federation withheld one million RMB in donations when the Hunger Strike Committee took back control of the Square on May 13. Upon learning of these funds, the CCP‚Äôs official stance was that donations came from reactionary forces and were used by the students in general to procure communication equipment and illegal arms. Intent on increasing support for the movement, Defend Tiananmen Square Headquarters established communication channels with media inside and outside of Beijing. Given the scale and context of the protests, foreign media was plentiful, allowing a series of press conferences to act as a main communication channel, examples of which can be found throughout the duration of the protest. May 27 saw Wang Dan, Wu‚Äôer Kaixi, and Chai Ling hold a conference announcing their intention to order a withdrawal from the square on May 30. Concluding the conference, Wang Dan listed ten points which aimed to publicize the protest as a peaceful and patriotic push for Chinese democracy. This conference successfully found an international audience with such news outlets as the New York Times and Washington Post reporting on it. June 3 saw Chai Ling, Li Lu, and Feng Congde hold another conference criticizing the CCP for using violence against non-violent students. However, this conference appears to have been overshadowed by the crackdown that immediately followed. Notably, Chai Ling attempted to use an interview with American Journalist Philip Cunningham as a tool to broadcast the protest‚Äôs purpose should she be killed or captured by Chinese authorities. This plan fell apart, however, when the interview was featured in the documentary The Gate of Heavenly Peace without Chai Ling‚Äôs knowledge. Chai Ling criticizes the documentary for intentionally misrepresenting her as wanting to bring bloodshed upon her fellow students. Documents and events The Defend Tiananmen Square Headquarters released several documents during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. * On May 24, 1989, the Defend Tiananmen Square Headquarters was formed. Wang Dan announced the formation of the Defend Tiananmen Square Headquarters, and Chai Ling lad students in the square took an oath. They made four decisions: 1. The organization will be responsible for the student safety in Tiananmen Square. 2. Chai Ling was chosen as the commander-in-chief. 3. Within 48 hours, the headquarters should finish reorganizing the Square. 4.

The area had been placed under cultivation and settled by the end of the 12th century. It survives in two manuscripts. The work is sometimes referred to as the Brookmerbrief, using the modern spelling of \\"Brookmerland\\". The Brokmerbrief is the most complete source on Frisian law. It describes the polity and judicial system of a country whose law was based on the will of the assembled people (the 'Frisian freedom'): political and judicial power was in the hands of functionaries selected annually from the ranks of the farmers, who were known as redjeven (consuls, counsellors); their power in turn was regulated by the Brokmerbrief. The period of independent rural self-rule came to an end by about the mid-14th century. However, unlike for example Emsigerland, Brokmerland remained a discrete unit, since the Brokmerbrief forbids the erection of fortified stone residences and castles and this had prevented the establishment of such starting points for localised rule. Thus feudalism, otherwise widespread throughout Europe at this time, remained unknown in East Frisia. However, Emsig Law eventually prevailed in the area, probably as a result of the emergence of the tom Brok dynasty, but certainly by the time of Cirksena hegemony. In the early 16th century, Edzard I then based his East Frisian Law () on the Emsig Law. The Brokmerbrief is unique among the documents of Old Frisian law in consisting of a code of law in the strict sense, rather than a compilation. It is preserved in two manuscripts, one of which is in the State Archives of Lower Saxony in Oldenburg and the other in the Lower Saxony State Library in Hanover. The middle section of the text strongly resembles the Emsig law on fines, indicating a common source.Karl Freiherr von Richthofen, Untersuchungen √ºber friesische Rechtsgeschichte, Volume 1 Berlin: Hertz, 1880, , pp. 218-19 .

This book records the Tiananmen protest of 1989 from April 15, 1989, to June 4, 1989, in detail. Author Feng Congde is one of the student leader in the protest and his day-by- day diary entries, record every activity during the protest including the start of student protests in Peking University, the activities of major student leaders, important events, and unexposed stories about student organizations and their complex decision making. The content of A Tiananmen Journal is based on Feng's Memo of 1989 Student Protests (), first drafted in 1990. To ensure the details of the activities are in correct order and what he heard from others during the protests was truthful, Feng started editing his Memo and adding footnotes in the following eighteen years, before finally publishing them in the book, A Tiananmen Journal.  Synopsis  The book is divided into nine chapters: # Previous Stories # Accidental Involvement (April 15 ‚Äì April 18) # The Establishment of Preparatory Committee (April 19 ‚Äì April 24) # Five Person Standing Committee (April 25 ‚Äì April 28) # In Charge of the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation (April 29 ‚Äì May 6) # From Low Tide to Hunger Strike (May 7 ‚Äì May 13) # Broadcasting Station at the Square (May 14 ‚Äì May 23) # Headquarters at the Square (May 24 ‚Äì June 2) # The Last Few Days (June 3 ‚Äì June 4) =Chapter One= It briefly records the 1987 student protest at Tiananmen Square on New Year's Day. Some of the students were angry about the \\"Ten Regulations\\" () issued by the government on 26 December 1987 because the \\"Ten Regulations\\" restricts people's freedom of demonstration in Beijing.Feng, Congde. Liu Si Ri Ji = A Tiananmen Journal by Feng Congde: Guang Chang Shang De Gong He Guo. Hong Kong: Chen Zhong Shu Ju, 2009, 48. Therefore, some students organized a protest to oppose the \\"Ten Regulations\\". Finally, around 20 university students were arrested and given warnings.Feng, A Tiananmen Journal, 57. At the end of the month, Feng Congde heard news of Hu Yaobang's resignation and recognized that he was forced to resign because he sympathized the student protest on New Year's Day.Feng, A Tiananmen Journal, 63. =Chapter Two= On 15 April 1989, students were very emotional about Hu Yaobang's death. Some memorial slogans and radical words such as \\"Someone is still alive although he has died; someone has died although he is alive\\" () appeared on the notice board in Peking University.Feng, A Tiananmen Journal, 77. This slogan expresses two ideas. One is to criticize the governmental officers who ignored the need of the public. Another is to praise Hu's efforts on government reformation. To mourn Hu, around 3,000 students grouped in front of the monument at Tiananmen Square on 18 April 1989 and some gave public speech.Feng, A Tiananmen Journal, 82. At the same time, some military police stopped the memorial activity organized by students at Xin Hua Gate (), where most of the foreign journalists were reporting the event.Feng, A Tiananmen Journal, 84. =Chapter Three= On 19 April 1989, the Preparatory Committee in Peking University was formed. The members are Ding Xiaopin, Feng Congde, Xiong Yan, Zhao Tiguo, Wang Dan, and others.Feng, A Tiananmen Journal, 92. Some of these members played main roles later in the student protest of 1989. The first job of the Preparatory Committee was to plan a protest to against the \\"April 20 Incident\\" because the government distorted the truth of the incident and covered up the fact that the police beat students.Feng, A Tiananmen Journal, 99. The student protest against the \\"April 20 Incident\\" organized by the Preparatory Committee, however, was unorganized as the committee members lacked experience.Feng, A Tiananmen Journal, 107. =Chapter Four= Due to the failure of the \\"April 20 Incident\\" protest, there was a need to improve and reorganize the Preparatory Committee in Peking University. After the election, the Five Person Standing Committee led by Kong Qingdong, Wang Chiying, Feng Congde, Shen Tong, and Wang Dan replaced the Preparatory Committee.Feng, A Tiananmen Journal, 159. To express the discontent of the government, many students started students' strike. Even though the students were boycotting classes, they emphasized that they would not giving up studying they boycott to attend classes.Feng, A Tiananmen Journal, 174. =Chapter Five= Under the nomination of Wang Chaohua, Feng became the third chairman taking charge of the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation. Feng reveals that members in the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation were not allowed to attend any individual news conferences. Wang Dan and Wuer Kaixi, however, broke the rule and thus monitored by some policemen in plain clothes.Feng, A Tiananmen Journal, 195. They were afraid that they would be arrested so they decided to seek the protection from the federation. They then became \\"committee in name\\" () with no real power in any decision making in the federation and they started to hide for few days.Feng, A Tiananmen Journal, 196. Since Wang Dan and Wuer Kaixi appeared in the news reports frequently, outsiders such as foreign reporters always misunderstood their roles. They thought Wang Dan and Wuer Kaixi were the representatives of the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation and had the real power in decision making. =Chapter Six= While the student protests were last for almost a month and the government seemed to ignore the students' requests, the morale of the students dropped. In order to increase morale, Wang Dan and Chai Ling suggested using a more radical way to urge the government and a hunger strike started. Their suggestions were not approved by the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation because the federation thought that it would be a radical and danger decision.Feng, A Tiananmen Journal, 273. Even though the federation refused to carry out a hunger strike, Wang Dan and Chai Ling gave their suggestion publicly in the \\"Freedom Forum\\" (), a place inside Peking University where people can give speech and express views freely every night, to seek supports.Feng, A Tiananmen Journal, 273. Finally, Chai Ling's \\"Hunger strike letter\\" () brought a huge impact and gained mass support.Feng, A Tiananmen Journal, 280. =Chapter Seven= After Chai Ling's \\"Hunger strike letter\\" was announced, around 800 hunger strikers were at the Square on 13 May 1989.Feng, A Tiananmen Journal, 283. Many hunger strikers fainted including some of the student leaders such as Chai Ling and Wuer Kaixi.Feng, A Tiananmen Journal, 338. Under the pressure of the student protests, Li Peng organized a conversation with some student leaders. Feng criticizes the conversation because it had no live broadcast and it was not wholly reported by all newspapers.Feng, A Tiananmen Journal, 339. Feng also criticizes Wuer Kaixi's performance in the conversation because Wuer Kaixi repeated saying that \\"student leaders and the federation were powerless and students at the square were derivate from the democratic process\\".Feng, A Tiananmen Journal, 340. Feng indicates that Wuer Kaixi gave the government an excuse to use military force because \\"student leaders are not capable of controlling students' behaviors.\\"Feng, A Tiananmen Journal, 340. =Chapter Eight= The Headquarter at the Square was facing financial difficulties because the account book was unorganized and confusion.Feng, A Tiananmen Journal, 408. As the hunger strikes seemed not effective enough, some student leaders started to discuss the issue of retreating from the square. Li Lu suggested having an election and let the students at the Square to decide this issue.Feng, A Tiananmen Journal, 417. Finally, 97% of the students voted to stay indefinitely.Feng, A Tiananmen Journal, 418. Soon, there were rumors of military suppression and student leaders were on the black list.Feng, A Tiananmen Journal, 433. Therefore, the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation gave student leaders one thousand RMB for escape.Feng, A Tiananmen Journal, 463. =Chapter Nine= During the course of the military suppression on June 4, one person witnessed that eleven students were killed by tanks.Feng, A Tiananmen Journal, 522. However, the Voice of America reported that 2,700 people were killed. Feng doubted about the veracity of that number because the number of deaths was given immediately after the military suppression at the Square.Feng, A Tiananmen Journal, 526. The protest was ended and Feng and Chai escaped from China with financial support from the Peking University's Preparatory Committee.Feng, A Tiananmen Journal, 531.

Founded in 1992 by the businessman Eike Batista and headquartered in Pouso Alegre, Minas Gerais, JPX produced an adapted version of the French Auverland sport utility vehicle. Batista's inexperience in the automaking industry and a series of mistakes led to the closing of the company in 2002, being the first failed venture of the billionaire, once the eighth- richest man in the world.  History  Batista's aim was to develop a utility vehicle to serve his mining company activities, as well as the Armed Forces and the general public. Based on the Auverland A-3 used by the French Army, the company produced a car model, the JPX Montez, available in the SUV and pickup versions. The Montez was equipped with imported Peugeot's XUD-9A diesel engine and BA 7/5 gearbox, Carraro's axles and differentials. The body and chassis were made in Brazil. JPX sales were lower than expected: the projection was of 400 units sold/month, but the demand was of 200 units/month; most of them were issued to the army, park rangers and fire departments. Besides, the engines were not adapted to the diesel composition sold in the country and had overheating issues, due to a turbocompressor adapted to it. On the other hand, the cars' suspension was praised by its owners. The company's activities were terminated in 2002. JPX produced nearly three thousand units. Of these ones, roughly a thousand are still on the roads.

Heer, played by Iqra Aziz, is a nice and bright girl hailing from a rich household. She falls in love with a fellow student Jamal (Bilal Abbas) who, although intelligent and hardworking, is extremely poor. Heer idolizes her father, who in turn, dotes on her. She wants to marry someone like her dad, who had gone through struggle and hardship in his life and worked very hard to be a senior Bureaucrat. Heer finds this level of dedication and hard work in Jamal and falls in love with him. Jamal is scared that Heer's family will not accept him, so he does not profess his love to her, but finally, after seeing that Heer will not give up on him, he tells her that he is also in love with her. Through twists and turns in the plot, it is revealed that Heer has already been engaged, since she was two months old, to a boy (Shahmir) in her father's village, who is the grandson of the woman who brought her father up when his family died in a storm. Heer's father tries to break the engagement but then is reminded that ‚ÄòIzzat‚Äô(respect) is the most important thing in the world to the people of the village. He forces Heer to marry Shahmir. A headstrong Heer goes and marries Jamal. No one knows about this nikkah except Heer's friend Mishu and two waiters who work with Jamal. Heer's father is so angry with Jamal for being in touch with Heer,(after her marriage is arranged with Shahmir), that he asks his police force to beat him up. After being beaten up and released, Jamal has a car accident and falls into a coma. Heer looks everywhere for him and even tells her mother that she has married Jamall and cannot marry Shahmir but no one believes Heer. Her mother says she is making excuses so as to not marry Shahmir. Despite everything, Heer and Shahmir are married meaning Heer is stuck in a double nikkah. Turns out, Shahmir has a girlfriend and is rude to Heer. Heer has given up on life and is destined to her fate. She thinks Jamal has left her and taken advantage of her.

Shahmir breaks up with his girlfriend and wants to make it work with Heer. But Heer is hell bent on getting a divorce from Jamal who is nowhere to be found. Shahmir and Jamaal meet, and Shamir asks Jamaal to accept Heer since they both love each other. Upon hearing this, Jamaal figures that Shahmir loves Heer more than he does himself. He leaves, and Heer calls Jamaal to meet. The next day when they do meet, it is revealed that they were being followed by Shahmir‚Äôs elder brother, who is angry seeing Jamaal and Heer together. It is also shown that Shahmir is present in the area. Shahmir‚Äôs brother ends up shooting Jamaal more than once and shoots Heer on the shoulder.

The 'Hospital' was run as a charity by a corporation and a resident Master. The modern hospital, which started life as an isolation unit in 1902, was, by 1979, a rehabilitation centre catering for the young chronic sick and geriatric patients and the terminally ill, as well as those recovering from accidents and serious operations run by Derbyshire Area Health Authority. The decision to close the hospital was resisted by the Etwall Community Action Group and was supported by the staff who led a work-in until March 1980.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), an animal rights organization based in the United States, has released a number of browser games on its website that have parodied existing video games. Various PETA parodies have been made based on games such as Super Mario Bros., Cooking Mama, and Pok√©mon Black and White. PETA creates these games to spread attention about real-life animal rights and animal welfare concerns and advocate vegetarian and vegan diets.

Internet Archive. Archived 10 September 2004. Retrieved 13 May 2014. However it was not until 2007 that PETA began to attract wider attention within the gaming community with its release of Super Chick Sisters, a parody of Super Mario Bros. Controlling two female chicks named Nugget and Chickette, the player sets out to rescue vegetarian actress Pamela Anderson, who has publicly revealed animal cruelty endemic to KFC's food production, from KFC's mascot Colonel Sanders. In 2009, the game was met with a sequel, New Super Chick Sisters, a homage to New Super Mario Bros. In this game, McDonald's mascot Ronald McDonald kidnaps Anderson with the intent of using her as a Happy Meal ingredient, and the Chick Sisters must rescue her again. In 2008, PETA released an adaptation of the cooking simulator Cooking Mama called Cooking Mama: Mama Kills Animals. In it, PETA encouraged users to write to Cooking Mama developer Majesco Entertainment to create a version of the game with only vegetarian recipes. Mama Kills Animals consists of minigames related to the preparation of animal carcasses, in this case, a stuffed turkey. After successfully completing the main levels, Mama goes vegan and hugs a live turkey, while the player makes a tofurkey. The game contains facts about turkeys and includes vegan Thanksgiving recipes. In Super Mario Bros. 3, Mario can wear an item called the \\"Tanooki Suit\\" ‚Äì a costume resembling a tanuki (raccoon dog) similar to those shown here. PETA created Mario Kills Tanooki to draw attention to the real-life killing of raccoon dogs for their fur. Edmund McMillen from Team Meat, the developer of the indie game Super Meat Boy, created various accounts on PETA's official forums to try to get his game parodied by PETA. PETA developed Super Tofu Boy and released it in December 2010. It stars Tofu Boy, an anthropomorphic cube of tofu whose goal is to rescue Bandage Girl, the girlfriend of the original game's protagonist Meat Boy, from Meat Boy. It plays as a standard platformer and is peppered with inter-level pro-vegetarian messages and facts about meat consumption and the livestock industry. After releasing Mario Kills Tanooki, a parody of Super Mario Bros. 3, PETA released a statement that the game was \\"meant to be tongue-in-cheek, a fun way to call attention to a serious issue, that raccoon dogs are skinned alive for their fur.\\" The organization also stated that \\"by wearing Tanooki, Mario is sending the message that it's OK to wear fur.\\" It is an action game in which the player controls a skinned but living raccoon dog that chases Mario to retrieve its fur. PETA took on the Pok√©mon series with Pok√©mon Black and Blue, a parody of Pok√©mon Black and White that focuses on animal fighting and experimentation. In role-playing-style battles, the player controls a Pikachu who escapes Ash Ketchum‚Äôs abusive circus. Pikachu first fights a drunk Cheren, who brutally abuses his Tepig in a dog fighting-esque manner, and then moves on to other Trainers and characters in order to rescue their Pok√©mon from their ownership (a Snivy being experimented on by Professor Juniper, an Oshawott skinned alive by Ghetsis, and finally Ash himself). Pikachu recruits these Pok√©mon to its cause, as well as the sympathetic Nurse Joy. A sequel, Pok√©mon Red, White, and Blue, followed in 2013. The game suggests that Nintendo's continual releases of Pok√©mon games reduce humans' empathy for animals. Also a role-playing game, it stars Pikachu and Miltank, who battle McDonald's characters like the Hamburglar in a crusade against the rare but ongoing practice of meat production in the Unova region. Pikachu must rescue a Jigglypuff from being treated like furniture, a Miltank from the dairy industry and the slaughterhouse, and Grimace from being tortured. At the beginning of the game, Pikachu is nearly eaten by an obese gamer but lives. Also in 2013, PETA released Cage Fight: Knock Out Animal Abuse, a beat 'em up game in the style of River City Ransom. The player controls vegetarian mixed martial arts fighters Jake Shields, Aaron Simpson, and Georgi Karakhanyan and attacks animal testing practitioners to rescue confined animals. There is a warning before the game begins that it is illegal to punch scientists in real life. PETA has parodied Fast Food Nation in a game called ‚ÄúYou Want Lies With That?‚Äù. The player controls an evil chef who must create hamburgers while avoiding the pigs and cows who are chasing him. Successful completion of each level reveals the links between meat consumption and heart attacks or E. coli. There is also a hunting game where the player shoots tofu deer; ‚ÄúStick a Chick‚Äù, where the player must prevent salmonella-infected chicken from entering the shopping cart; an animal testing awareness game that also spreads awareness about breast cancer; a gory maze game about seal clubbing; several games about animal skins used in fashion; and a quiz game that compares the American Kennel Club to the KKK. Reception and impact PETA's games have received mainly negative opinions from video game journalists. Forbes writer Erik Kain summarized the series in general as \\"a long parade of silly protests.\\" He also considered PETA's failure to satirize well-known hunting games like Duck Hunt and Big Game Hunter as well as the general message that video games encourage real-life violence, to be illogical. Response to Mario Kills Tanooki has been negative, generally holding that it was under- researched. While PETA's protest focused on Mario wearing a raccoon dog's skin rather than harming them himself, Gaming Union stated that \\"from any gamers' perspective, it's clear to see that PETA have missed their mark on this one; Mario squishes hundreds of enemies in each of his games, but is never seen harming a tanuki.\\" Kain called the game \\"ludicrous\\" given that gamers had long adored the Tanooki suit and would not be encouraged to kill real-life raccoon dogs. Jessica Conditt from Joystiq found the messages of Pok√©mon Black and Blue to be contradictory: \\"while it's terrible to punch, kick, cut or hit fictional animals with bats, it's perfectly acceptable to electrocute humans\\". Jason Schreier from Kotaku called it \\"ridiculous\\". Kotaku's Mike Fahey wrote a mostly negative piece about Pok√©mon Red, White, and Blue; he stated that despite its occasional humor, \\"mostly it just wanders about, beating its message into your brain with heavy hands.\\" Not all critical response has been unfavorable. Fahey opined that New Super Chick Sisters \\"manages to be a rather capable little platformer despite its heavy-handed message.\\" Nikole Zivalich of G4TV called Super Tofu Boy \\"actually a pretty good time waster\\" and, as she is a vegetarian, claimed to be \\"on Team Tofu.\\" Overall, Mike Splechta from GameZone stated that \\"some are a little less flattering than others, but they do tend to get their point across.\\" He also called Cage Fight \\"kickass\\", praising its gameplay and chiptune soundtrack, and encouraged readers to play it. In some cases, the creators of the original games have responded to PETA's parodies. In response to Super Tofu Boy, Super Meat Boy developer Team Meat added Tofu Boy as a playable character in a Super Meat Boy update. Majesco responded to Cooking Mama: Mama Kills Animals that the Mama character, while not a vegetarian herself, supports treating animals humanely and \\"would never put rat in [her] Ratatouille.\\" Nintendo also released a statement in regards to Pok√©mon Black & Blue stating, \\"Nintendo and the Pok√©mon company take the inappropriate use of our products and intellectual property seriously.\\" Notable titles PETA's games‚Äîand the games they parody‚Äîthat have received press coverage include: *Super Chick Sisters (2007) ‚Äì New Super Mario Bros. *Cooking Mama: Mama Kills Animals (2008) ‚Äì Cooking Mama: World Kitchen *New Super Chick Sisters (2009) ‚Äì New Super Mario Bros.

Reasons for complete autonomy include the linguistic and cultural divide between Denmark and the Faroe Islands as well as their lack of proximity to one another; the Faroe Islands are about 990 km (approximately 620 miles) from Danish shores. History of sovereignty =Pre-Denmark= It is known that Norsemen settled the islands c. 800, bringing the Old Norse language that evolved into the modern Faroese language. These settlers are not thought to have come directly from Scandinavia, but rather from Norse communities surrounding the Irish Sea, Northern Isles and Western Isles of Scotland, including the Shetland and Orkney islands, and Norse-Gaels. A traditional name for the islands in the Irish language, Na Scigir√≠, means the Skeggjar and possibly refers to the Eyja-Skeggjar (Island-Beards), a nickname given to the island dwellers. According to F√¶reyinga Saga, emigrants left Norway who did not approve of the monarchy of Harald I of Norway. These people settled the Faroes around the end of the 9th century. It is thus officially held that the islands' Nordic language and culture are derived from the early Norwegians. The islands were a possession of the Kingdom of Norway (872‚Äì1397) from 1035 until their incorporation into Denmark. =Under Danish rule= The flag of the Faroe Islands was designed by Faeroese students in Copenhagen in 1919 The islands have been ruled, with brief interruptions, by the Danish government since 1388, all the time being part of Norway up until 1814. Although the state of Denmark-Norway was thoroughly divided by the Treaty of Kiel of 1814, the Faroe Islands remained in Danish hands. A series of discriminatory policies were put in place soon after the treaty; the Faroese parliament, the L√∏gting was abolished in 1816 along with the post of Prime Minister of the Faroe Islands. The aforementioned offices were replaced by a Danish judiciary. Concurrently, the usage of the Faroese language was generally discouraged and Danish was instilled as the official language of the region. The renewed Danish Constitution of 1849 granted the Faroese two seats in the Danish Parliament Rigsdagen. 1852 saw the restoration of the L√∏gting, albeit merely as an 18-member consultative body to the Danish authorities. The nationalist fervor has its roots in late 19th century, established initially as a cultural/political movement which struggled for the rights of using the Faroese language in the schools, the church, in media and in the legislature. The designated start is believed to be the Christmas Meeting of 1888, which was held on December 22, 1888 in the L√∏gting (parliament) in T√≥rshavn. Two of the persons who participated were J√≥annes Patursson and Rasmus Effers√∏e. Patursson had written a poem which Effers√∏e read aloud, the first line starts: N√∫ er tann stundin komin til handa,125 √°r s√≠√∞an j√≥lafundin √≠ 1888 which is often cited in support of the movement.N√∫ er tann stundin... Tj√≥√∞skaparr√∏rsla og sj√°lvst√Ωrispolitikkur til 1906 The poem was about preserving and taking care of the Faroese language; over the years it has gained a strong cultural footing in the Faroe Islands. The Faroese language was not allowed to use in the Faroese public schools as teaching language until 1938,F√∏royskar b√≥kmentir, page 4 (in Faroese) and in the church (F√≥lkakirkjan) until 1939. Young students who studied in Denmark played a prominent role in the nationalist movement. The Faroese Merki√∞ flag was designed in 1919 by Faroese students in Copenhagen. Prior to the Merki√∞'s utilization, there were other flags which some of the Faroese people identified themselves with, one was a flag featuring a ram and one was a flag with a tjaldur. Denmark was occupied by Nazi Germany as part of the Second World War on April 9, 1940. The United Kingdom, viewing the Faroe Islands as strategically valuable, began a military occupation of the islands in order to thwart further German conquest of Danish territory. This effectively put the Faroe Islands under British administration until the conclusion of the war in 1945. Under British rule the Merki√∞ was recognized as the official flag of the Faroes so that authorities could discern what vessels were Faroese fishing boats and which were hostile. Status of autonomy In the status quo, the Faroe Islands is an autonomous country of the Kingdom of Denmark, sharing this distinction with Greenland. In response to growing calls for autonomy, the Home Rule Act of the Faroe Islands was passed on March 23, 1948, cementing the latter's status as a self- governing country within The Unity of the Realm. The Act has also allowed the vast majority of domestic affairs to be ceded to the Faroese government, with the Danish government only responsible for military defence, police, justice, currency and foreign affairs.Lov om de f√¶r√∏ske myndigheders overtagelse af sager og sagsomr√•der (written in Danish) The Faroe Islands are not part of the European Union. The Faroe Islands is also operating its own national football team and is a full member of FIFA and UEFA. Political solutions =Organizations= Schematic depiction of the political party spectrum in the Faroe Islands Four local political parties seek independence from Denmark: the People's Party (Hin f√∏royski f√≥lkaflokkurin), Republic (Tj√≥√∞veldi), Progress (Frams√≥kn) and Centre Party (Mi√∞flokkurin). These parties, while spanning the political left and right, make up 17 of the L√∏gting's 33 seats. In addition to this is the Self-Government Party (Sj√°lvst√Ωrisflokkurin) generally touts the idea of sovereignty, albeit with a more moderate fervor than the aforementioned parties. =1946 referendum= On September 14, 1946, a referendum regarding independence was held. With a valid vote count of 11,146, 50.74% voted in favor of independence while 49.26% opted to remain associated with Denmark, leaving a difference of 166 votes between the two options. The chairman of the L√∏gting declared independence on September 18; this move was not recognised by the opposition parties, and it was annulled by Denmark on September 20. King Christian X of Denmark subsequently dissolved the L√∏gting; it was swiftly replaced in the parliamentary election held on November 8, with parties favoring union with Denmark now retaining a majority. =Constitutional crisis= The Danish and Faroese governments have consistently haggled over the drastic revision of the Faroese constitution, with many clauses clashing with those of Denmark. The conflict reached its apex in 2011, when then-Prime Minister of Denmark Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen declared that new edits could not coincide with the state's constitution. Rasmussen presented two options to the Faroese: secede or scrap the hypothetical constitution. Faroese Prime Minister Kaj Leo Johannesen asserted that they would begin a new draft of the constitution and remain in the Danish Realm. Concerns of economic viability Although they enjoy a significant amount of autonomy from Denmark, the Faroe Islands still regularly rely on USD $99.8 million of government subsidies to keep their economy stable; in 1992 a banking decline of 25% sent the economy into a period of stagnation and 15% of the population to mainland Denmark. Financial support from the Danish government takes up 4.6% of the Faroese gross domestic product and accounts for 10-12% of the public budget. Norwegian oil and gas company Statoil has taken interest in the prospects of oil in the waters off of the Faroe Islands, embarking on an estimated US$166.46 million oil exploration operation. Exxon Mobil and Atlantic Petroleum also hold stakes in the drilling platforms being installed in Faroese waters. If these operations succeed and find the bountiful projected amounts of oil (USD $568,500 worth per each resident out of the Faroese population of 49,000) the prospect of independence may receive a boost.

Rotheram is the professor-in-residence in the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior. She is the Director of the Global Center for Children and Families at UCLA and the former director of the Center for HIV Identification, Prevention, and Treatment Services.  Education and early career  Rotheram received her undergraduate degree from the University of California, Irvine in 1971 and her PhD in Clinical Psychology with an emphasis in child and community psychology from the University of Southern California in 1977. She was a Professor of Clinical Psychology in the division of child psychiatry at Columbia University from 1982 to 1993. During her tenure at Columbia, Rotheram co-directed a clinic for suicidal adolescents and initiated her evidence-based programs on suicide, depression, and HIV. She mounted and evaluated multiple interventions which have now been selected and reviewed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Psychological Association (APA) as efficacious programs. In 1993, Dr. Rotheram moved to UCLA, where she has been a professor for over 20 years. During this time, she led a national center for HIV prevention funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and founded the UCLA Family Commons, a placed-based preventive program to promote well-being for children and families.  Research interests  Dr. Rotheram's research interests include HIV and AIDS prevention with adolescents, children and family wellness, and assessment and modification of children's social skills. Dr. Rotheram has received more than 80 grants from the National Institute of Health to study HIV prevention with adolescents, the chronically mentally ill, and persons with sexually transmitted diseases; to study interventions for children whose parents have AIDS and for HIV-positive adolescents; and to examine national patterns of use, costs, outcomes, and need for children's and adolescents' mental health service programs. In 1986, her work on suicide prevention was selected as the Outstanding Child and Adolescent Mental Health Program by the New York State Department of Mental Health, and her assertiveness training with children was chosen as an exemplary model by the American Psychological Association. Her research also has been funded by the National Science Foundation, National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, Society for Research in Child Development, and the W.

Publications  Dr. Rotheram has published more than 300 journal articles, 11 Training Manuals, 63 book chapters, and two edited volumes, Planning to Live: Evaluating and Treating Suicidal Teens in Community Settings and Children‚Äôs Ethnic Socialization: Pluralism and Development.  Scientific leadership  Rotheram pursues research to find better ways to promote family wellness. Her leadership in disruptive technologies is one example of how she is asking science and prevention to progress intentionally and thoughtfully. To that end, Rotheram has been recognized with several awards and commendations for her work. In 2001, Science identified her as number two of the top-funded NIH multi-grant recipients; she was the only woman in the top ten. Dr. Rotheram has overseen dozens of groundbreaking national and international efforts related to all aspects of HIV and AIDS. She has guided researchers‚Äô efforts to identify and address health disparities across different communities by using experts from a variety of fields. She notes 45 trainees whose research is making a difference in people‚Äôs lives, including 22 trainees who are now successful academic faculty members.

April 24, 1915 is considered the beginning of the Armenian Genocide, and is commonly known as Red Sunday, which saw the deportation and execution of many Armenian intellectuals. Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day was first observed on April 24, 1919 in Constantinople, Ottoman Empire (now Istanbul, Turkey), as a commemoration of the victims of the genocide. The event occurred in light of continued Armenian Genocide denial by Turkey.  Lead up  = Armenia = On April 23, 2011, a state commission coordinating of the events dedicated to the 100th commemoration of the Armenian Genocide was founded by a presidential decree. It is headed by the Armenian Genocide Museum-Institute director Hayk Demoyan. The first meeting of the commission was held on May 30, 2011, and chaired by President Serzh Sargsyan. Shavarsh Kocharyan, the Armenian Deputy Foreign Minister, stated in June 2012 that \\"the efforts that have been initiated are important not only for our country and the Diaspora, but for the entire world. The unpunished crimes against humanity and their denial create fertile ground for recurrence of similar events.\\" He claimed that \\"by denying the Genocide, the leadership of modern Turkey resembles the Ottoman Turkish government which perpetrated the Genocide.\\" On July 5, 2013, during a forum of Armenian lawyers in Yerevan about the anniversary of the genocide organized by the Ministry of Diaspora, Armenia's Prosecutor General Aghvan Hovsepyan made a \\"sensational statement\\". He stated: According to ArmeniaNow news agency \\"this was seen as the first territorial claim of Armenia to Turkey made on an official level. The prosecutor general is the carrier of the highest legal authority in the country, and his statement is equivalent to an official statement. Although,Giro Manoyan, Director of the International Secretariat of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaktsutyun) Bureau in Yerevan, commented on the development, saying that it was still impossible to say that Armenia had made a formal claim to Turkey.\\" In response, the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement on July 12, 2013, saying that Hovespyan's statement: Opposition politician and 2013 presidential election runner-up Raffi Hovannisian stated that: Vartan Oskanian, Armenia's Foreign Affairs Minister from 1998 to 2008, stated in 2013 that he has: = Armenian diaspora = The Lebanese-based Catholicos of Cilicia Aram I stated in May 2011 that the 100th anniversary of the genocide is \\"not a regular date\\" and that the Armenian organizations and institutions \\"should consider thoroughly our actions and words.\\" He suggested a \\"need to change our behavior\\" and called on Armenia: He went on to explain: Armenian American writer Harut Sassounian claims that \\"the Turkish government and its agents are closely monitoring all announced Armenian plans, so Ankara could prepare its counter-moves to the anticipated Armenian 'Tsunami'.\\" In his words, Turkey \\"would be helping to publicize the Armenian Cause\\" by attempting to counter the upcoming genocide centennial activities.  Memorials  Eiffel Tower goes dark in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide. In July 2013, the construction of the Armenian Genocide Museum began in Montevideo, Uruguay. Uruguay, which was the first country to officially recognize the Armenian Genocide in 1965, thus became the first country besides Armenia to build a museum dedicated to the Armenian Genocide \\"at the initiative of the state.\\" The Ministry of Education and Culture along with the Armenian community of Uruguay is expected to complete the construction of the museum on the 100th anniversary of the genocide. In September 2013, the Pasadena City Council approved the proposal for a genocide memorial, which is expected to be completed by April 24, 2015. It is expected that the Armenian Genocide Museum of America in Washington DC to be opened in 2015. In addition, the Montebello Genocide Memorial in California is expected to become a historical landmark in 2015, coinciding with genocide centennial.  Reaction  = Armenian Church = On April 23, 2015, the Armenian Apostolic Church held a ceremony outside of the Etchmiadzin Cathedral in Vagharshapat to canonize the victims of the Armenian Genocide. The ceremony was held to coincide with the start of the killings, ending at the symbolic time of 19:15 with a bell ringing 100 times. Armenian churches around the world likewise rang a bell 100 times at 19:15 local time. The ceremony, which created around 1.5 million new saints, was the first canonization by the church in 400 years. Catholicos Karekin II remarked, \\"The canonization of the martyrs of the genocide brings life-giving new breath, grace and blessing to our national and ecclesiastical life. The blood of the Armenian martyred for Christ has placed the seal of unshakeable faith and patriotism on the sands of the desert\\". Among those in attendance of what is believed to be the largest canonization service in history was President Serzh Sargsyan. = Turkey = ;Official In an address to Turkish envoys, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan stated: ;Non-official According to the Turkish journalist Mehmet Ali Birand: ƒ∞shak Alaton, Turkish businessman, stated in 2012 that: Journalist Hasan Cemal, who is the grandson of Djemal Pasha, one of the main perpetrators of the genocide, stated in 2013 that \\"Turkey, as a state, should apologize to the Armenians\\". = United States = On April 10, 2014, on the eve of the 99th anniversary, the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations reported to a resolution (S. Res. 410) United States Senate which condemns and commemorates the Armenian Genocide, describing it as an act of \\"elimination of the over 2,500-year presence of Armenians in their historic homeland\\". Drafted by committee chairman Robert Menendez (D-NJ), it was approved by a vote of 12‚Äì5.

It originally aired on November 4, 2010. The episode was written by Brian Young and directed by Liz Friedlander. Plot The man who kidnapped Elena (Nina Dobrev) meets Trevor (Trent Ford), the vampire who asked him to kidnap her, and transports her into his car. Right after Elena is in Trevor's car, Trevor kills the man and leaves with the unconscious Elena. Damon (Ian Somerhalder) talks with Caroline (Candice Accola) about Tyler (Michael Trevino) and how she covered him killing Sarah in the previous episode, something that triggered the curse and he will now turn into a werewolf to the next full moon. Damon warns her to stay away from him and not let him know about her being vampire or other vampires because a bite of his can kill them. Caroline says she will stay away from Tyler and leaves for school. Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) runs into Stefan (Paul Wesley) and thinks that Elena slept over at his house since she did not sleep at her bed the previous night. Stefan tells him that Elena was not with him and they realize that she is missing. Stefan tells Damon who tells Stefan about what Katherine said before he locked her in the tomb; that Elena is in danger but he did not believe her. Stefan wants to talk to Katherine but Damon says they'll find another way to find Elena because Katherine will negotiate her freedom and that is something they do not want. Trevor takes Elena, who wakes up, in an abandoned house. She asks him what he wants from her but he does not answer when Rose (Lauren Cohan) appears and is shocked on how much Elena looks alike Katherine. Elena thinks they confused her to Katherine and that is why they took her and she tries to tell them. Rose already knows but she reassures her that they know who she is. Elena overhears the two of them talking about a guy named Elijah and the deal they want to have with him; give him Elena in exchange of their freedom. Back in Mystic Falls, Stefan asks Bonnie to undo the tomb spell so Katherine can get out but Bonnie doesn't want to do it. Instead, she tries another spell to find Elena's location. The spell works and Stefan and Damon leave to find her while Jeremy stays behind with Bonnie, whose nose started bleeding after the spell but she hides it and no one sees it. At High School, Tyler tries to talk to Caroline and asks her how does she know about him, but Caroline pretends that she doesn't know what he is talking about. Tyler does not believe her and he later goes to her house to confront her. He thinks she is also a werewolf and he will not leave until she admits it. Eventually, Caroline reveals herself as a vampire and she tells him that he must not tell anyone. Tyler admits that he is scared the day the full moon will come and he will have to turn into a wolf and Caroline tries to comfort him. Jeremy and Bonnie are at the Gilbert house waiting for news and Bonnie tries a new spell. She tries to send Elena a message but during the spell, her nose bleeds again. As soon as she completes it, she collapses. Jeremy manages to recover her and she asks him not to tell anyone about what happened. Meanwhile, Elena wants to know who Elijah is and keeps asking Rose and Trevor about him. Rose explains that he is one of the Originals from which she and Trevor are running away for 500 years. The Originals want them dead because they helped Katherine escape and now they just want Elena to deliver her to Elijah in exchange for their lives/freedom. Elena is valuable to them because her blood (a doppelganger's blood) can break the vampire/werewolf curse. While Rose talks to Elena, Trevor is not sure if it is a good idea that they called Elijah to come and when he arrives, Trevor freaks out, something that makes Elena realize that they are afraid of him. Rose manages to calm him down and leaves to meet Elijah. Rose meets Elijah and tells him that Katherine survived back in 1864 and that there is also a human doppelganger of hers. Elijah seems unwilling to believe her but he does when he sees Elena. Trevor apologizes for his betrayal to Elijah who forgives him but he still kills him. Elena is terrified of him and tries to negotiate with him by telling him that she knows where the moonstone is. When she refuses to tell him unless he lets her free, Elijah tears off her vervain necklace and compels her to tell him. In the meantime, Stefan and Damon have arrived and they enter the house to save Elena. They distract Elijah and take Elena and Rose to safety. They attack him and Damon manages to impale him on the front door with a wooden stake and kills him. Elena is relieved, hugs Stefan and thanks Damon while Rose runs away. They all return home, Elena reunites with Jeremy and Bonnie and the Salvatore brothers agree to set aside the fights and protect Elena together. Rose appears at the Salvatore house to offer her help because, as she says, Elijah might be dead but the rest of the Originals will come for Elena because they all work for him; Klaus. In the meantime, Damon pays a visit to Elena to give her back her vervain necklace but before he does it, he admits to her that he loves her and then compels her to forget about it. He leaves the room and Elena stays behind with the necklace, wondering what happened. The episode ends with Elijah coming back to life and unimpaling himself from the door looking mad.

We also met some new pertinent characters. Most importantly, we found out about the Original Vampires. I also really liked finding out that Katherine was the Petrova Doppelganger. [...] I‚Äôm looking forward to finding out more about all of this.\\" Josie Kafka from Doux Reviews rated the episode with 3.5/4 even saying that it was not one of the best episodes. \\"This was not the best episode ever, and it had some glaring inconsistencies, but the Massive Information Dump pretty much set up the rest of the season and contributed a huge amount of (relevant) lore to the world of the Vampire Diaries.\\" The review from Den of Geek was positive with the reviewer saying that it was a pretty good episode with a good set-up which will allow the next one to start with a bang. \\"While I was shocked to find out that Elena is the key to the sun and moon curse, I wasn't expecting to find out that Katherine was once a doppelganger herself. I am interested to see where this news takes us in episodes to come.\\" Despite the positive reviews, Robin Franson Pruter of Forced Viewing rated the episode with 2/4 saying that it was an uneven episode introduces major storyline and characters. \\"Overall, this episode is a mixed bag. Too much of the episode is weak for me to give it a positive judgment, but two strong closing scenes‚Äîone relationship-related, one plot/threat- related‚Äîand the beginning of a new relationship (Caroline/Tyler, which, at this point, is merely friendship) keep the episode on the cusp of being good.\\" References External links * 2010 American television episodes The Vampire Diaries (season 2) episodes ","title":"Rose (The Vampire Diaries)"},{"id":"42469315","text":"House Spirits Distillery is an American craft distiller based in Portland, Oregon.

The distillery's flagship brand is Aviation American Gin, which comprised 80% of its production in 2012, and around 40% in 2016, after the company's move into a larger distillery facilitated a major expansion of production of its whiskey brand. Production of Westward Oregon Straight Malt Whiskey, made from malted barley grown in the Pacific Northwest, accounted for around 50% of the company's production in late 2016. Other products include Krogstad Festlig aquavit and Volstead Vodka. Small-batch artisanal liqueurs from House Spirits have included Japanese-style sh≈çch≈´ and coffee liqueur. In 2013, the company made plans to expand its distribution to 35 states in a deal with distributor Southern Wine & Spirits. The same year, House Spirits opened a second tasting room at Portland International Airport. Former NFL quarterback Joe Montana is an investor in the company. In November 2015, House Spirits opened a new, larger distillery in Portland's Central Eastside Industrial District. The $6 million, facility, built almost entirely new, also included a tasting room. At the time, House said the expansion would enable them to double their production of American Aviation Gin and increase their production of Westward Oregon Straight Malt Whiskey tenfold.

Lee's men soon took cover in a ditch, while Puller's forces \\"tried to turn Umanzor's left flank.\\" During the firefight, Corporal Bennie M. Bunn grabbed a Browning automatic rifle and began driving the Sandinistas back. The battle concluded, after one hour and ten minutes, in a victory for the Marines and National Guard. Thirty-one Sandinista corpses were found after the battle (and 63 live horses were captured), compared to losses of three killed and three wounded for the Guard. Moncada got to participate in ceremony two days later, as planned. He was so pleased with American performance during the battle that he promoted Puller to major and Lee to captain.

She taught in Philadelphia public schools, becoming a principal in 1935 and serving until her retirement in 1952. She inspired generations of African-American students. During the 1920s she was part of a literary group known as the Black Opals. In 1927-1928, together with Arthur Fauset, she co-edited Black Opals, a literary magazine named after a line from a poem in its first issue. Although it was published in Philadelphia, the magazine was considered part of the larger artistic world of the Harlem Renaissance. Similar literary groups and magazines sprang up in Boston and Washington, DC.Wintz, Cary D., and Paul Finkelman, ed. \\"Black Opals\\", Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance, Vol. 1, (2004), p. 133 Born in Savannah, Georgia to parents who were college graduates and professionals, Bright and her family moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the early 1910s during the Great Migration. Her father was an Episcopal priest and her mother a teacher and social worker. Bright completed most of her education in Philadelphia, graduating from the University of Pennsylvania. She devoted most of her life to her students, as a teacher and a principal.  Early life  Nellie Rathbone Bright was born in Savannah, Georgia on March 28, 1898, the only child of Reverend Richard Bright and his wife Nellie (Jones) Bright. The girl was named after her mother and maternal grandmother; her middle name was in honor of her godmother, a white woman named Caroline Rathbone who was a family friend and social activist. Bright's father was born on Saint Thomas in what was then the Dutch West Indies. He received his education at St. Augustine Collegiate Institute in Raleigh, North Carolina. He went on to graduate studies, earning a divinity degree from the General Theological Seminary in New York in 1891. Upon graduation, he was ordained as an Episcopal priest. Rev. Bright was called to the Episcopal diocese of Savannah, the first black Episcopal priest to be appointed in the diocese. Bright's mother, Nellie, was from Louisville, Kentucky. She had been educated in Europe to escape the racism of the South. After her return, she became a teacher.[Nellie Rathbone Bright Family Papers (Collection 2057), The Historical Society of Pennsylvania. http://hsp.org/sites/default/files/legacy_files/migrated/findingaid2057nelliebright.pdf]Ballard, Allen B. Breaching Jericho's Walls: A Twentieth-century African American Life. Albany: Excelsior Editions/State University of New York, 2011, p. 23 Shortly after their arrival in Savannah, in 1892 the Brights established the first private kindergarten and primary school for blacks in Georgia. Around 1910, the Brights moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where Rev. Bright had accepted an appointment. The industrial city was one of the northern destinations for tens of thousands of black migrants from the rural South, attracted to its jobs and other opportunities in the Great Migration. Bright's congregation aided newcomers to adjust to urban life.  Education and career  Bright attended Philadelphia public schools: first Stanton Public School, and then William Penn High, where she obtained a diploma as a grade school teacher with a special certificate in sewing. In 1919, Bright entered the University of Pennsylvania, where she earned a bachelor's degree in English in 1923.

Johnson, Nellie Rathbone Bright, Pauline Alice YoungWhile at the University of Pennsylvania, Bright was a charter member of the Gamma chapter of the university's first black sorority, Delta Sigma Theta. Other members of her chapter included Virginia M. Alexander, who later became a physician and founded the Aspiranto Health Home; Anna Roselle Johnson, a social worker, educator, civic activist, and wife of the famed chemist Percy Lavon Julian; and Sadie Tanner Mosell, the first woman to receive a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Bright also chartered the Xi Sigma chapter of Delta Sigma Theta, together with ten other women. Bright also studied at the Sorbonne and University of Oxford, as well as studying art at the University of Vermont and at the Berkshire School of Art in Massachusetts. She traveled extensively as an adult and was a landscape painter. After her graduation, Bright worked as a teacher in Philadelphia public schools. Additionally, she became active in a group of young black intellectuals in the city in the 1920s. She co-founded a literary journal called Black Opals with Arthur Fauset. The magazine drew its name from a line from a poem \\"Longings,\\" published in the first issue in 1927. It read \\"... flame like fire in black opals.\\"Aberjhani, Sandra L. West. Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance. New York: Infobase Publishing, 2003, p. 263 Bright and Mae V. Cowdery, another poet from Philadelphia, both had poems published in the first issue; they were praised by Countee Cullen, the new literary editor of Opportunity, a journal in New York. Their literary group became known by the same name; these young people in Philadelphia were typical of literary groups that arose in numerous East Coast cities, inspired by the Harlem Renaissance.Elizabeth McHenry, Forgotten Readers: Recovering the Lost History of African American Literary Societies, Duke University Press, 2002, pp. 292-294 Bright and Fauset intended their journal as a quarterly but ceased publication in 1928 after only three issues, as the journal failed to gain a large enough readership.Aberjhani, Sandra L. West. Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance. New York: Infobase Publishing, 2003, p. 119 In 1935, Bright was appointed principal of the segregated Joseph E. Hill School in Philadelphia. One of her students, future author and history professor Allen Ballard, said that she was a strict principal who instilled a love for and pride of African-American history and culture in her students: > We were all Nellie Bright's children and she expected great things from us. > And so she created a wonderful school. A landscape painter and writer ... > Miss Bright saw to it that the Hill School was immaculate and vibrantly > decorated with pictures and posters. She and her staff made the achievements > of blacks a cause for year-round celebration. Blackboards and walls were > crowded with posters of Harriet Tubman, Toussaint L'Ouverture, Frederick > Douglass, Alexander Dumas, and the great black Russian writer > Pushkin.Ballard, Allen B. Breaching Jericho's Walls: A Twentieth-century > African American Life. Albany: Excelsior Editions/State University of New > York, 2011, p. 24 Bright served as a principal of three different schools before she retired in 1952. During her career, Bright also served on more than fifteen civic boards or organizations directed toward improving schools and neighborhoods; she was concerned about the whole life of her students and their world. She worked to gain improvements in city health services, and to facilitate \\"cooperation among diverse members of society.\\" Later years After her retirement, Bright taught in-service courses to teachers on black history until 1959, under direction of the Board of Education. Classes were held at the Fellowship House in Philadelphia (now located at Fellowship Farm in Pottstown, Pennsylvania). It is an interracial organization dedicated to learning about and understanding cultural and ethnic differences. In 1972, Bright co-authored American - Red, White, Black, Yellow with her longtime colleague Arthur Fauset. This history book for children and young adults focused on the history of minorities in the United States. Bright died on February 7, 1977. She is buried in Eden Cemetery in Collingdale, Pennsylvania.  Personal life  In addition to her educational and writing pursuits, Bright was a landscape painter in oils. She spoke French and Spanish fluently. Bright traveled extensively in her lifetime, spending time in both the Caribbean and Europe. Bright remained single her entire life.

History The hospital has its origins in the North Bierly Union Workhouse which opened in 1858. The workhouse established its own infirmary from an early stage but benefited from a dedicated male infirmary block from 1872. The hospital joined the National Health Service in 1948. The hospital was slated for closure in 1983 to cut expenditure, which led to bitter resentment by the residents of the town of Bradford. The hospital had 82 beds with 70 patients and housed primarily long term elderly patients with no living family members. The impending closure threatened to distribute the long term patients to similar facilities nearby. The closure was discussed in Parliament in January 1983 and again in June 1984. The hospital was occupied by staff led by Alex Corina who resisted closure from August 1983 until April 1985, in an effort to get the facility re-designated as a geriatric hospital. A petition was circulated which resulted in 30,000 signatures and the support of local area residents, the Bradford Community Health Council and Bradford City Council as well as the families of the hospital patients. After the hospital closed, the buildings were converted for academic use by a girls' boarding school in 1992.

The latter agreement granted an autonomous status for Northern Epirus, as well as a number of rights for the local Greek populations, inside the borders of the newly established Principality of Albania.Kondis, 1976: p. 131: \\"By its terms Northern Epirus won completely autonomous existence under the purely nominal hegemony of Prince William.\\" The assembly took place in the town of Delvino (modern Delvine, southern Albania) with the participation of deputies from all provinces of Northern Epirus. It lasted from June 23 to July 26, 1914, and led to the ratification of the terms of the Protocol of Corfu, despite objections raised by various sides asking for wider autonomy. The Greek government under Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, also supported the approval of the Protocol, as the only means to secure peace and stability for the region, while on the other hand the representatives of the coastal region of Himara, insisted that only incorporation to Greece would be a viable solution for Northern Epirus. Background Paris Peace Conference of 1919, by the exiled provisional government of Northern Epirus By the end of the Balkan Wars (1912-1913), Greek armed forces managed to defeat the Ottoman army and control most of the historical region of Epirus. Thus, they reached a line from Himara on the Ionian coast east to Prespa Lake. Pending the final decision of the following peace treaty, the region remained under Greek military control. On 17 December 1913, the Protocol of Florence ceded the northern part of Epirus to the newly established Principality of Albania. This turn of events catalysed an uprising among the local Greek population, who declared the independence of Northern Epirus. The Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus was thus proclaimed in Argyrokastro (Gjirokast√´r) on 28 February 1914, while a provisional government was formed under Georgios Christakis-Zografos.Kondis, 1976: p. 125 Meanwhile, serious disturbances broke out in a number of places between the Northern Epirote forces and Albanian gendarmerie units and irregulars.Kondis, 1976: p. 127 An International Commission of Control formed by the Great Powers to secure stability and peace in the region was unable to achieve an agreement between the two sides.Kondis, 1976: p. 128-129: \\"In the whole of Northern Epirus abnormal conditions prevailed... fighting erupted again between the autonomists and the Albanians.\\" =Protocol of Corfu= Georgios Christakis- Zografos, president of the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus. By May 17, 1914, at a meeting held nearby in Corfu, Greece, representatives from both sides signed an agreement that would be known as Protocol of Corfu. According to this the districts of Korytsa and Argyrokastro, which form Northern Epirus, were recognized as an autonomous self-governing region under the sovereignty of the newly established Prince William of Albania. Moreover, the agreement granted the local Greeks wider religious, educational, cultural and political autonomy, inside the borders of the Albanian state.O' Brien, 2008: p. 65-66 Subsequently, on June 1 the Great Powers approved the terms of the Protocol, while on June 23 they were officially approved by the Albanian Government.Boeckh, 1996: p. 116 First meeting The Northern Epirote representatives in the following Pan-Epirotic Assembly of Delvino had to take the final decision on whether to accept the Protocol.Kaphetzopoulos, Flokas, Dima-Dimitriou, 2000: p. 240 The provisional government had to assemble the representatives from all parts of Northern Epirus in order to ratify the terms of the Protocol. Thus, Delvino, which was one of the first towns in Northern Epirus to declare autonomy against annexation to Albania, was proclaimed the seat of the following assembly. The representatives, listed by province, were as follows: *Himara: Spyros Spyromilios, Dimitrios Lekkas, Nikolaos Milios *Agioi Saranta: Ioannis Kouremenos *Delvino: Evangelos Giatis, Evangelos Trichas, Panagiotis Lezos *Argyrokastro: Kyriakos Kyritsis, Georgios Tselios, Charalambos Katsis *Premeti: Zacharias Alexiou, Charalambos Donatos, Georgios Syngelos *Tepeleni: Petros Charitos, Vasileios Dilios *Pogoni: Georgios Ginopoulos, Papaspyros, Dimitriadis *Leskoviki: Vasileios Sotiriadis, Ilias Oikonomou Rousis *Erseka: Petros Prontinis, Dimitrios Papanastasiou *Korytsa (Korc√´): Iosif Adamidis, Konstantinos Skenderis, metropolitan bishop of Korytsa, Germanos, Konstantinos Polenas *Additional five delegates, representing the wider region. Representatives of Himara region, among them Spyros Spyromilios, insisted that only union with Greece would be a viable solution for Northern Epirus The provisional government was represented by its president, Georgios-Christakis Zografos, as well as by Dimitrios Doulis, Alexandros Karapanos, Georgios Boussios, and the local metropolitan bishops Vasileios and Spyridon. Discussions started at June 23. Zografos, stated in his inaugural speech: Additionally, Zografos proposed that the working sessions be put off until June 26, so the representatives would have the sufficient time to study the text of the Protocol.Kaphetzopoulos, Flokas, Dima-Dimitriou, 2000, p. 241 Political and military developments Meanwhile, political turmoil broke out in Albania, where the official government was unable to control the situation. The guerrilla forces of Essad Pasha Toptani managed to capture Elbasan in central Albania, while various irregular bands in this sector pillaged the countryside and moved against Korc√´, which was part of the Northern Epirus region, but still under the control of the Albanian gendarmerie. Zografos, worried by these developments, and contrary to the warnings of the Greek Prime Minister, Eleftherios Venizelos, ordered the Northern Epirote forces to enter the city immediately, which happened in July. Finally, Essad Pasha requested negotiations with the Northern Epirotes since he was already involved with the conflict against Prince Wied. At the same time, in the sector of K√´lcyr√´ (Kleisoura) the autonomist forces successfully engaged Albanian units. =Disagreements over the Protocol and ratification= The military successes of the Northern Epirote forces triggered much enthusiasm among some of their leaders. The latter claimed that the northern border of Northern Epirus should be drawn further north, including additional areas which, according to them, where once also part of historical Epirus. Additionally, some Epitore representatives claimed that they should negotiate for wider autonomy, while the Greek populations of Vlor√´ and Berat, which lay north of the claimed autonomist boundary, should also enjoy the same religious and educational rights.Stickney, 1926: p. 48 The Greek government, without being involved until then in the situation, was aware of the negotiations and the possibility of a final agreement. Greek Prime Minister Venizelos urged Zografos to approve the protocol‚Äôs terms as soon as possible without asking for even wider autonomy.Kondis, 1976: p. 132: The autonomists took much longer to ratify the agreement... the constituent assembly approved the agreement on July 26, 1914. Venizelos warned Zografos of the risks that would entail in case of non- ratification: Greek Prime Minister, Eleftherios Venizelos, urged Zografos to accept the Protocol of Corfu. The Assembly met in session again at June 26, and discussions were long and intense. The strongest objections were raised by the representatives of Himara, and especially by its representative, Spyros Spyromilios. The latter considered that the Northern Epirotes had nothing to gain from this Protocol, despite the hard won struggle. Especially, he claimed that the Protocol‚Äôs provisions about Himara, were left to the goodwill of the International Commission of Control. Spyromilios also reminded the delegates that when the Northern Epirote struggle started, in February 1914, all participants had unanimously decided for \\"complete autonomy or total destruction\\".Kaphetzopoulos, Flokas, Dima-Dimitriou, 2000, p. 242 In general, all the representatives agreed that the Protocol did not fulfil the aspirations of the Northern Epirote struggle. Finally, the delegates ratified the terms of Protocol of Corfu. On the other hand, the representatives of Himara decided to withdraw, protesting in favor of union (Enosis) with Greece.Kaphetzopoulos, Flokas, Dima-Dimitriou, 2000, p. 243Sakellariou, 1997, p. 381: ...\\"with the exception of the delegates from Cheimara, who walked out of the assembly shooting slogans in favor of union with Greece.\\" Aftermath The Protocol of Corfu, although having been accepted by both sides and sanctioned by the Great Powers, was unable to be implemented. After the outbreak of World War I on July 28, 1914, the situation in Albania became unstable and political chaos ensued. When the country became split into a number of regional governments, Prince William departed the country in September 1914. On 27 October, after approval of the Great Powers, the Greek army re-entered Northern Epirus and the Provisional Government of Northern Epirus formally ceased to exist, declaring that it had accomplished its objectives.Miller, 1966, p. 522 The region was de facto annexed to Greece until the second half of 1916, when Italian troops evicted the Greek army from the area.Stickney, 1926, pp. 57-64Miller, 1966, p. 537 After the end of World War I it was finally ceded to the Principality of Albania.Miller, 1966, p. 543-544 References Sources    * Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus Law by former country Treaties concluded in 1914 ","title":"Assembly of Delvino"},{"id":"42469698","text":"bitComposer Interactive GmbH was a video game publisher headquartered in Eschborn, Germany.

The film was the second Mickey Mouse cartoon shot in Technicolor (after The Band Concert) and is also the first color appearance of Pluto. The cartoon is also the first color cartoon where Mickey speaks (though he only does so at the end when Pluto starts licking him). The film's plot centers on Mickey Mouse trying to rid his garden of insects, but they keep coming back. When he accidentally gets hit with his own bug spray, he begins seeing a warped reality. It was the 76th Mickey Mouse short film to be released, and the fifth of that year.. The only bit of dialogue is during the last 20 seconds when Mickey tells Pluto to stop licking him. Plot Mickey's garden is being invaded by insects. Mickey, in an attempt to get rid of them, uses insecticide, but it eventually runs out, and the insects are able to continue eating. Mickey goes back and attempts to make some more insecticide. The insects return and resume eating all the food in the garden. Mickey comes back and tries to poison the bugs, but the pump is blocked and Mickey tries to unblock it. At the same time, Pluto is following a stag beetle. It bites him on the nose. When it teases him from atop a plant, he lunges at it and gets his head stuck inside a pumpkin. He runs about it with the pumpkin on his head and bumps into Mickey, making him get hit by his own bug spray, after which he begins seeing hallucinations. Mickey finds himself in an imaginary world where he, his house, and Pluto have shrunk and the bugs and plants have grown giant. The giant bugs proceed to drink the insecticide, but instead of killing them, it makes them drunk. They notice Mickey and Pluto and chase them for revenge. After encounters with a worm and a beetle, Mickey and Pluto climb up and hide in a flower but are stung by a bee and fall out of it. Pluto lands on a caterpillar who throws him in the air. He is then swallowed by a hiccuping firefly. Mickey lands on a leaf but a drunk grasshopper saws off the leaf with its leg. Mickey falls and lands in a tomato with a worm, which he proceeds to ride (in the style of Charlie Chaplin) and then wrestle. Eventually Mickey wakes up and discovers, much to his delight, that the worm he was wrestling was really his hose. Pluto manages to break free from the pumpkin and catapults it onto Mickey by accident, and starts licking him.

John Willacy, farmer and legislator, was born in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1859. He moved to Texas in 1892 and settled in the Corpus Christi area as a truck farmer. From 1899 to 1914 he was a member of the Texas legislature, where he served in the House of the Twenty-sixth and Twenty- seventh legislatures and in the Senate of the Twenty-eighth through the Thirty-third. He was chairman of committees on finance and internal improvements and served on committees on judicial districts and stock raising. Willacy was perhaps best known as the author of the bill providing for county local option, which is the ability of local political jurisdictions, typically counties or municipalities, to allow decisions on certain controversial issues based on popular vote within their borders. In practice, it usually relates to the issue of alcoholic beverage sales, which in the 1920s and 30s was a controversial issue, especially as prohibition in the United States was in effect. In 1911 Willacy introduced a bill to form a new county out of parts of Cameron and Hidalgo counties, and the resulting new county was named in his honor. He moved from Corpus Christi to San Antonio in 1912, and in the early 1920s was state tax commissioner under Governor Pat Morris Neff.

Fictional character biography =1960s= Zota of Pergamum possessed vast knowledge of the mystic arts, which he exploited to cast Cleopatra into a deep trance in 47 BCE, as well as send her to 20th-century New York City. He did so as a form of retaliation against the Egyptian pharaoh for rejecting his love towards her. Doctor Strange discovers Cleopatra and, with the assistance of the Ancient One, travels back in time to end Zota's diabolical ways. Having had a premonition of Strange's coming, Zota quickly generates a force-field out of light, which entraps Strange. The Sorcerer Supreme hits back by conjuring a billow of smoke, destroying the light prison. After a long showdown leaves Zota exhausted, the victor Strange uses a mystical amulet to hypnotize Zota. He is forced to reveal how to reverse the spell he placed on Cleopatra. Strange later takes away all knowledge of sorcery from Zota and sends them back to ancient Egypt. =1990s= During the Infinity Gauntlet storyline, Thanos the Mad Titan uses his newfound abilities to send Doctor Strange and his fellow sorcery exponent Clea to circa 37 BCE. Their presence is noted by Zota, who at this point in time still has knowledge of magic and is combing the Library of Alexandria for what would become known as the Scroll of Vishanti. His efforts are to no avail, as the scroll has found Zota unworthy to be its owner and has thus magically vanquished from his view. After being received by Julius Caesar and a younger Cleopatra (in comparison with the one Strange first met), Strange and Clea set off to find the fabled Library of Alexandria. It is there where Strange bumps into Zota for the second time (but it is the first time for Zota). The Egyptian warlock captures Clea and places her in a magical mirror. Holding her ransom, Zota demands the Scroll of Vishanti in exchange for Clea's life. Strange relents and hurls the scroll to him; however, the scroll electrocutes Zota by instinct.

Its educates musicians, technicians, creative leaders, and music business professionals for secular or religious careers.Visible Music College Academic Catalogs Visible Music College is authorized for operation as a post-secondary educational institution by the Tennessee Higher Education Commission, offering four-year Bachelor's degrees, three-year Master's degrees and a one year certificate program. It is accredited by the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS).Visible Music College awarded accreditation History Visible School was created in early 2000, after Dr. Ken Steorts, founding guitarist of the Christian rock band Skillet, had left the band to travel to Coventry, England to view a Christian music college resembling the idea of Visible School. After visiting the Nexus Academy of Music, he began Visible Community School of Music and Worship ArtsVisible Music College Academic Catalog as a ministry of Grace Covenant Church, also located in Memphis, Tennessee. The 2000-2001 school year began with twenty-one students and four full-time faculty. During the 2001-2002 school year, the school formally separated from Grace Covenant Church, now Lifelink Church, and became an incorporated and authorized school of higher education in the state of Tennessee.Tennessee Higher Education Commission, Listing of authorized post-secondary institutions In August 2002, the school grew to sixty-nine first and second year students, and partnered with Crichton College for accredited coursework through the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). The school also formalized relations with Days Inn, Lakeland, Tennessee for dormitory housing, creating a campus for the institution. The faculty increased to twelve and programs increased to match student and faculty growth. In the late 2003, Visible School increased again to seventy-nine first and second-year students, twenty faculty members, and added a School Board. Working towards institutional accreditation through TRACS, Visible School is nearing all of its original intended goals of one hundred new students per year, and programs in the arts to minister worldwide. In early 2003, faculty and staff decided to gain independent accreditation from Crichton College through TRACS. Throughout mid-2003, investigation into several arts accrediting bodies and various Christian accrediting bodies was completed. The decision to pursue TRACS recognition was made, and the school moved forward. In mid-2005, Visible School ended its relationship with Crichton College. Visible School, now able to receive United States Department of Education (DOE) Authorization for Title IV aid, stood alone as a college for which students could get loans and aid directly. However, the Department of Education denied Visible School the ability to obtain aid for its students due to low ratio scores financially. Expected enrollment of 100 became 65, with the course load of 35 students paying in cash and unsecured loans. Financially the budget shrank, and many of the faculty took part-time hours and pay cuts to balance. In the late 2005 and early 2006, a single donor stepped up to cover the costs of running the school for the remainder of the 2005-2006 academic year. Visible School was able to hire a full-time Librarian and continue offering full course loads to students as a result of the TRACS accreditation process. The faculty continued to receive training. Many assessment processes began, as the College matured in planning, executing, and assessing the results of student education. Mid 2006 saw an increase in enrollment and positive audited financial statements, bringing 65 full-time students, and with tight financial restraint and budgeting, a successful enough year to receive DOE authorization for the spring term. This in turn, granted financial aid to all students in any economic situation. In early 2007, the student body number rose and the school focused on International Programs and Recording Projects, such as Visible Media Group; an artist development facet of Visible School, and VMI;Visible Music Week a national and international week-long music training program. The Executive Council expanded to include all the Directors, including the new Director of Institutional Development. The College improved, with consolidated offices, technological updates, and reduced faculty workload. The focus of TRACS requirements link, coupled with the ongoing assessment and response with TRACS that had begun years before combined to give Visible School 70 new students. In February 2008, the student population rose again. With more fundraising and spending, the financial success of the school is beginning to materialize. A healthy student body and faculty relationship is the hallmark of Visible School, and that connection has returned and grown through the initiatives of the school over the 2007-2008 school year. Expecting 80 full-time students in a reduced number of courses and major programs, Visible School has had the most successful year of its history in 2008-2009, culminating in a decision by second Self-Study, a TRACS Self-Study Team visit, and a TRACS Commission decision to grant Accredited Status to the College in 2009.

The pristine mustached bat (Pteronotus (Phyllodia) pristinus) is an extinct Late Quaternary species of bat in the endemic Neotropical family Mormoopidae. It was distributed in Cuba and possibly Florida (United States). Distribution This bat is known only from subfossils. It was described from Late Quaternary cave deposits in Cuba (Las Villas Province, Trinidad, Cueva de los Masones) and found also in Rancholabrean cave deposits in southern Florida (Monkey Jungle Hammock). Fossil distribution of the pristine mustached bat. Pteronotus pristinus - red (Trinidad, Cuba), P. cf. pristinus - black (Monkey Jungle, Florida, USA). Florida specimens (two mandibles) were only tentatively referred to Pteronotus cf. P. pristinus, because they could not be directly compared with the Cuban material (several skulls, postcranial elements), but they may represent P. pristinus. This is the only occurrence of Pteronotus in the United States, fossil or recent. Cuba is the most likely source for West Indian bats in Florida. Extinction shaded relief map of the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea area contoured at -100 m depth. In Florida, the pristine mustached bat became locally extinct at the end of the Pleistocene, what probably resulted from the rise in sea level, the subsequent flooding of caves and loss of roosting sites. The sea level in Florida was as much as 100 m lower in late Pleistocene, as well water tables, and cave systems in Monkey Jungle Hammock, Cutler Hammock and Rock Springs were dry. But during the latest Pleistocene the rising sea level caused flooding of these cave systems and destroyed a hot and humid microclimate of so-called hot caves. Currently two first of them are sediment-filled sinkholes few meters above sea level, third one is submerged. In these three sites in southern peninsula, the sea level stand change presumably was also reason of extirpation of another tropical cave-dwelling bat in the Neotropical family Mormoopidae (extralimital ghost-faced bat Mormoops megalophylla) and one North American species (southeastern myotis Myotis austroriparius) as well. The fourth species - big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) became rare in Florida caves. Such a pattern of extinction or extirpation is known also from many small islands in West Indies (Bahamas, Cayman Islands, Lesser Antilles).

Empress Maria Theresia was satisfied with his performance to such an extent that in 1769 she gave him the important position of the Emperor's special envoy and plenipotentiary at the Court of St James's in London. In the following years he also accompanied Maria Theresia's son Joseph on his journeys to a number of European courts and cities. On 3 May 1781, Belgiojoso was admitted a Fellow of the Royal Society.

He remained as authorised minister in Brussels the next four years until 1787. In this period emperor Joseph II tried to introduce a number of reforms, especially in the field of education, which caused a lot of resistance. When Joseph replaced the central organs of government (most notably the Collateral Councils) with a single General Council of Government, and abolished the Council of Brabant, replacing it with a supreme court, he provoked widespread rioting and a rising in Brussels known as the \\"Small Revolution\\" in May 1787.Dale Pappas, Belgium from Revolution to the War of the Sixth Coalition 1789‚Äì1814, at napoleon-series.orThe Southern Netherlands, 1789‚Äì1795, at zum.de The government in Brussels tried to calm down the unrests by suspending the edicts from January 1787 which caused the troubles. This prompted a furious reaction from the emperor. With order from 24 June 1787 Count Belgiojoso, his authorised minister in the Austrian Netherlands, and the Duke of Teschen, his governor-general, were both recalled to Vienna. They left Brussels between 19 and 20 July. Both were replaced ad interim with Joseph Count Murray de Melgum, commander-in-chief of the Austrian army in the Austrian Netherlands. Following an invitation of the emperor, a delegation of the Provincial States of Brabant travelled to Vienna to meet the Emperor. Although Joseph felt a bit satisfied by this gesture, the disputed issues remained unsolved and both sides left frustrated. In an attempt to soothe the tensions Count Murray again suspended in September 1787 the edicts from January.

About to start his compulsory military service in early January 2011, just before 25 January revolution, Mansour remained anonymous without announcing his role as the underground Cairo-based administrator of the Facebook page \\"We are all Khaled Saeed\\", the main online tool that mobilized the initial mass protests against torture and police brutality, and which culminated weeks later in the ouster of Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak, who had ruled the country for the previous three decades.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-revolution- idUSTRE73C18E20110413 Wael Ghonim, who was living abroad at the time, was the page's publicly known administrator.

After his graduation and immediate conscription, he traveled to the United States in late 2013 to continue his academic studies.  Career  He first became politically active in 2005, joining the protest movement Kefaya to demand political reforms in Egypt, and later participated in student movements across several Egyptian universities. Since then, he has been active in raising awareness among Arab audiences on the importance of political activism, citizen movements and broadcasting Abdelrahman became an active blogger with \\"Kulina Layla (We are all Layla),‚Äù a feminist initiative that provided Arab women with an electronic platform to counter conservative voices in mainstream social media. He worked to expand the platform, introducing it in Morocco and Saudi Arabia. In 2009, he began collaborating with Wael Ghonim to moderate and manage the online page of Mohamed Elbaradei, who had returned to Egypt the same year. After the tragic death of Khalid Saeed, the two online activists started the Facebook page \\"We Are All Khaled Saeed\\". Involvement in the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 In 2010, Abdelrahman and Wael Ghonim founded the Facebook page, \\"We Are All Khaled Saeed,\\" to commemorate the death of Khaled Saeed, a young Egyptian who was tortured to death by police in Alexandria in the same year. They utilized the page, with up to 3,000,000 followers, to mobilize for anti-government and anti-torture protests on 25 January. On 14 January, Abdelrahman conducted a survey on the page to test the waters, asking members if they would follow in the footsteps of Tunisians and take to the streets on 25 January. Enough enthusiasm poured prompting him and Wael to generate an online event entitled: 25 ŸäŸÜÿßŸäÿ± ÿ´Ÿàÿ±ÿ© ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿπÿ∞Ÿäÿ® ŸàÿßŸÑŸÅÿ≥ÿßÿØ ŸàÿßŸÑÿ∏ŸÑŸÖ ŸàÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ∑ÿßŸÑÿ© (January 25: Revolution against Torture, Corruption, Unemployment and Injustice). This first call to protests was soon picked up by many other activists. Both Abdelrahman and Wael collaborated anonymously with other activists on-the-ground to plan the locations for the protests.

Results STARS-II was successfully launched at 3:37am (JST) on February 28, 2014 (February 27 UTC), and amateur radio downlink showed that it successfully separated from the carrier vehicle, however, the experiment was only partially successful, and tether deployment could not be confirmed. Initial radio data suggested that the solar arrays and antennas were not deployed. The beacon from the daughter spacecraft became weak, and after several weeks was no longer received. It was inferred that solar battery power was low due to its small body. However, the beacon from the mother spacecraft later became strong, and it was inferred that the solar arrays and antennas were deployed by restarting. However, the Command and Data Handling subsystem did not work, possibly due to radiation.M. Nohmi, \\"Initial Orbital Performance Result of Nano-Satellite STARS-II\\", International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and Automation in Space (I-SAIRAS), Montreal, Canada, June 17‚Äì19, 2014(accessed 7 July 2016) The orbit decayed from 350 km to 280 km in 50 days, considerably faster than the other cubesats launched on the same mission, which is indirect indication that the tether deployed, increasing the drag. However, telescopic photography of the satellite from the ground showed the satellite as a single point, rather than two objects. The experimenters suggest that this may have been due to the tether extending, but being tangled by rebound.

Her own mother was the playwright and novelist Ad√®le Daminois. She was also the mother of French knight Ange Du Fresnay and the ancestor of French writer and silent film director Guy Du Fresnay as well as of French contemporary essayist and economist Philippe Du Fresnay. Her life inspired Honor√© de Balzac's most famous novel Eug√©nie Grandet (1833), which depicted in part her family, who were living at the time in the French city of Sartrouville.  Biography  In 1833, as he revealed in a letter to his sister, Honor√© de Balzac entered into a secret intrigue, with Marie (aka \\"Maria\\") du Fresnay, who was then 24. Her marriage to Charles Antoine Du Fresnay, son of Charles Du Fresnay, former mayor of Sartrouville (portrayed as \\"Charles Grandet, nephew of the former mayor of Saumur\\" in Eug√©nie Grandet) had been a failure from the start, with a 23-year age difference between them. In this letter, Balzac reveals that the young woman had just come to tell him she was pregnant. In 1834, 8 months following Honor√© de Balzac's letter to his sister, Maria du Fresnay's daughter Marie-Caroline Du Fresnay was born. In 1839, she appears as the dedicatee of the second edition of Honor√© de Balzac's Eugenie Grandet under the pseudonym \\"Maria\\", which was her nickname in her social circle. This is also the year of birth of her second son and third child, Ange Du Fresnay. In 1850, she would inherit a statue of French sculptor Francois Girardon from Honor√© de Balzac, which confirmed the rumor of his paternity. However, the link was only confirmed in 1946, when Maria's grandson Charles du Fresnay told French journalist and historian Roger Pierrot that Marie's nickname used to be \\"Maria\\".

Plot The young Marion von Hoff lives with her widowed mother Vera on their estate in East Prussia. As the Trakehner Breeding Farm was evacuated in the winter of 1944/1945, the farm's manager Kalweit along with his men and many valuable Trakehner studs arrive at the von Hoff estate. Kalweit convinces Vera von Hoff to leave the estate and to flee westward. Before he dies as a consequence of stress from fleeing the stud farm, Kalweit entrusts Marion von Hoff with the newly born Trakehner foal Prusso, for whom he predicts a bright future in equestrian sports based on his pedigree. Along with the other refugees and with a heavy heart, mother and daughter leave their home and flee with Prusso and their most valuable possessions in a cart as the Second World War reaches its end. After being turned away many times, the von Hoffs are finally taken in by Mrs. Buddensiek on her farm in Lower Saxony. As time passes, Prusso grows into a stately horse that is envied by many. When Dr. Peter Meining, the local veterinarian, prevents Prusso's theft, Marion falls in love with him. However, Marion does not realize that Dr. Meining's interests are instead directed at her mother. As Vera one day helps him deliver a newborn foal, Dr. Meining finally reveals the nature of his intentions to Vera. She reciprocates but tells him to hide their feelings for the moment in order to avoid hurting love-struck Marion. At Russo's first tournament debut, he is ridden by Dr. Meining. Dr. Meining sets an overly-quick tempo and suffers a hard fall as a result. Vera cares for Dr. Meining while Marion retrieves Russo. As she makes a chance glance out a window, she suddenly sees the sort of close relationships that has developed between her mother and Dr. Meining. In her shock, she attempts to drown herself, but her swimming instinct is too powerful and she eventually washes up unconscious on the riverbank. The relationship between Vera von Hoff and her daughter Marion remains strained for a while thereafter. Prusso, meanwhile, has received such critical acclaim that he is asked to join the national team and be trained at the equestrian training center in Eberslohe. Marion reluctantly acquiesces to the offer and takes Russo to be introduced to his new trainer G√ºnther Legler. Legler is far too hard in his handling of Prusso, and there are many tense exchanges between Marion and Legler as a result. Although Marion threatens multiple times to leave the center with Prusso, she is unable to make good on her threat because her mother, Prusso's legal owner, has signed an official Terms of Training document. Ultimately, Marion accepts the situation and an improvement eventually occurs in her relationship with the self-confident Legerer who was convinced from the beginning that he could ‚Äútame‚Äù Marion. At the Riders‚Äô Ball on the night before Legler and Prusso compete in the Prize of Nations Tournament in which Legler, Marion dances with Legler as her mother and Dr. Meining enter the ballroom. Marion is now overjoyed to see her mother again and forgives her for keeping her relationship with Dr. Meining a secret. The next morning as Prusso and Legler face the formidable Berndella ridden by Lieutenant Ortega, Marion sends her horse and her new love off with the Trakehner saying: ‚ÄúShow your courage, Trakehner-blood!‚Äù In a thrilling race, Prusso and Legler prevail in the international competition over Berndella und Ortega.

Life and work  He was the son of painter Johannes Hau (1771-1838), who had emigrated from Northern Germany in 1795, and he grew up in the German community of Tallinn (\\"Reval\\" in German). His half- brother was the painter Woldemar Hau. From 1830 to 1832, he studied at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts. From 1836 to 1839, he lived in Tartu (\\"Dorpat\\"), where he also spent the last years of his life. In between, he apparently lived in Saint Petersburg, where he produced numerous interior portraits of rooms in the Winter Palace, the Peterhof Palace and other Royal residences. He was on the membership list at the Imperial Academy of Arts in 1854,University of Tartu Library: Short Biography and probably remained in Russia until c.1880. The Gatchina Palace was burned by German troops during World War II. When it was rebuilt, the interior was restored using Hau's paintings as a guide. Outside of Russia, he is primarily known for his portraits of the Professors at the University of Dorpat. They appeared from 1837 to 1839 and were distributed in a series of lithographs, in six issues, by the firm of Georg Friedrich Schlater (1804-1870).

Abstinence-only sex education does not include joint curriculum covering other options including safe sex practices, family planning, and is espoused as the only sure way to avoid pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Uganda is commonly recognized as an exemplary case of lowering the rate of HIV prevalence Cohen, J., & Tate, T. (2005). The less they know the better. Abstinence-only HIV/AIDS programs in Uganda pg 1. Prevalence figures may have also been distorted by the lack of treatment, meaning that the percentage of infected is decreased by disproportionately early deaths. Abstinence-only sex education has been implemented and supported for this cause to a large degree in Uganda, to some controversy. Critics have questioned its effectiveness in lowering HIV/AIDS transmission. They have also highlighted discrimination, gender inequality and social stigma as the outcomes of the program in Uganda. Origins In the wake of an increase of HIV prevalence in Uganda since it first appeared in 1982,Stoneburner, R. L., & Low-Beer, D. (2004). Population-level HIV declines and behavioural risk avoidance in Uganda. Science, 304(5671), 714-718. many programs were introduced to lower incidence of HIV and educate about the disease. Abstinence-only sex education was implemented as one way to quell the spread of HIV/AIDS, in addition to creating a positive behaviour change to the same end over time. As the epidemic became known on the international scene, money and resources from many nations flooded Africa in general and Uganda in particular. Abstinence-only sex education in Uganda in the late 1990s onward was largely financed by the United States and independent faith-based organizations Programs =Abstinence, Be faithful, use a Condom (ABC)= The ABC approach was introduced during the US-Ugandan efforts to propose Abstinence-only as a way to lower HIV transmission. ABC is an acronym, A being Abstinence, B being Be Faithful, and C being Condom use. It would seem that this form of abstinence-only includes some education and encouragement of condoms, but the application of ABC is disaggregated for specific populations. The breakdown is Abstinence for people not yet married, Be Faithful for those in marriages, and Condom Use only for people that are already infected or are in a marriage where one person is infected. ABC has evolved since its inception to a program known as AB, released in 2004 as an official abstinence-only education program for Uganda specifically. AB has lessened the emphasis on condoms due to the confusing nature of teaching the two simultaneously and the fear that condoms undermine the message of abstinence. AB is criticized for its lack of follow-through of collecting data on whether participants are abstaining or not. The main source of data collected for AB is the number of AB rallies, organizations and discussions concerning AB, instead of the behavioural changes proposed by AB. Therefore, AB is difficult to monitor as the true success of the programs aims for abstinence and social modifications, but no data is kept. =Condoms, Needles, and Negotiation (CNN)= Condoms, Needles and Negotiations was born out of the necessity of failing marital monogamy. CNN stands for Condoms, Needles and Negotiation. In sub-Saharan Africa, Uganda included, married women in monogamous relationships are at a disadvantage due to the lack of rights within marriage, bargaining power, and domestic violence.Sinding, S. W. (2005). Does ‚ÄòCNN‚Äô(condoms, needles and negotiation) work better than 'ABC'(abstinence, being faithful and condom use) in attacking the AIDS epidemic. International Family Planning Perspectives, 31(1), 38-40 The need was discovered as most new HIV cases come from HIV women contracting the disease in their marriage through their husbands. In this way, AB abstinence-only education falls short for protecting the lives of those practicing it. The Condoms part of CNN is two-fold to reduce condom stigma and promote use within the B (Be Faithful) section of AB. Women are still practicing faithfulness, but in order to protect their health, they still need to be able to understand and use condoms. The first N in CNN covers needle exchange, which doesn't relate to abstinence-only sex education. But the second N stands for Negotiation, which again plays a part for individuals practicing faithfulness who could still be harmed. Negotiation informs partners of the risks they might encounter if their partner is not being monogamous and teaches them skills to bargain in their position in the relationship. =Presidential Initiative on AIDS Strategy for Communication to Youth (PIASCY)= In 2001, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni introduced his official program for sex education for the youth of Uganda, Presidential Initiative on AIDS Strategy for Communication to Youth, abbreviated as PIASCY. PIASCY mainly targets primary schools, secondary schools and after school youth rallies with materials and instruction (HRW, 29). The main focus of PIASCY is for young people to empower themselves to delay their sexual relations until marriage through abstinence. PIASCY is primarily funded through the United States Agency for International Development and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, both of which provide many other services outside of finances to support the program. In addition, PIASCY has since become a foundation feature in the United States‚Äô President's Emergency Plan for AIDS relief (PEPFAR). Primary schools The medium for primary school involvement with PIASCY is a combination of manuals, instruction for teachers to relay to students, as well as materials given directly to the students based upon their age/grade. An assembly is normally held twice a month school wide for teachers to give presentations outlined from the curriculum within the PIASCY manuals. The first message is the choice of abstinence and its benefits, but subsequent lessons can include teachings of self-esteem and how to be above peer-pressure. Although other parts of PIASCY include correct condom application and uses, at the primary level, abstinence- only is the majority of the message. Secondary schools In 2004, the Ugandan government incorporated PIASCY in secondary schools, in the form of handouts for students as well as teachers. The curriculum is disseminated in the classroom format on a regular basis. The secondary school level information was drafted to include age sensitive subjects such as masturbation, abortion and homosexuality, but was met with strong opposition from many powerful, yet undisclosed, groups in Uganda and the United States. In addition, draft copies of the secondary school handouts contained misleading and inaccurate information about condoms and HIV prevention. Furthermore, condoms were encouraged after marriage as HIV prevention, but did not explain how this differed with unmarried youth. The final drafts did include rudimentary instruction on condoms without the corresponding photos. Out-of-school programs PIASCY also has a significant section of their focus targeting youth that are not in school by holding rallies and events after school or outside of school. In Uganda, there are significant numbers of youth that are not enrolled in school, despite the recent movements to educate everyone. Although these events are generally held on a school campus or facility, anyone aged 15‚Äì30, student or not can participate. These events generally have speakers who are as diverse as the President of Uganda to religious leaders. In more rural areas, these serve to disseminate important abstinence messages but have been criticized as supporting an agenda of re- election and political messages and including inaccurate information about condoms and abstinence. After the formal rallies and programs, it is made aware that political leaders are around to take questions that youth may have about the current government. PEPFAR, an organization providing funding to PIASCY, outlines promotion of information, prevention and treatment of HIV, and is in contradiction with the political agenda and misleading information sometimes found in the PIASCY after school programs. =Faith-based organizations= In Uganda, there are a number of faith-based organizations that provide abstinence-only education to youth. Many of these are financed and supported by not only the Ugandan Government, but also the United States. In general, these are based on Christian beliefs, as 60% of Ugandans are Christian.Human Rights Watch interview, Kampala, November 10, 2004. National (Uganda) Youth Forum The National Youth Forum was founded by one of the nation's largest activists for abstinence-only sex education, first lady Janet Museveni. The primary objective for the National Youth Forum (NYF) is to coordinate assemblies where young boys and girls pledge to stay sexually pure until marriage. More than 70,000 Ugandan youths have committed to this through NYF.Janet Museveni, \\"The AIDS Pandemic: Saving the Next Generation,\\" World Congress of Families, New York, May 3, 2002, http://www.worldcongress.org (retrieved January 11, 2005). Anne Mugisa, \\"Janet to Host 70,000 Virgins,\\" The New Vision, December 1, 2004, http://allafrica.com (retrieved December 2, 2004). NYF and Museveni advocate abstinence-only education in its most exclusive form, even pushing the notion that condoms are inadequate in preventing HIV and education involving them promote sexual activity among youth. She has gone so far as to propose a nationwide testing of young boys and girls for virginity, although this has not come to pass. Ms. Museveni's organization NYF also obtains funding from the American government.Priya Abraham, \\"Hooked on Failure Africa: In Africa‚Äôs Fight Against AIDS, the United States Continues to Support Family-Planning Groups that Stifle the White House Abstinence and Fidelity Message,\\" World Magazine, November 6, 2004, http://www.worldmag.com (retrieved December 8, 2004). This relationship has been called under scrutiny on the grounds that UNF Proselytizing and the laws of the United States regarding the secular nature of congressional funding.A December 2002 executive order governing federal funding of community and faith-based organizations states that, in accordance with the U.S. Constitution's separation of church and state, \\"organizations that engage in inherently religious activities, such as worship, religious instruction, and proselytization, must offer those services separately in time or location from any programs or services supported with direct Federal financial assistance.\\" Executive Order 13279‚ÄîEqual Protection of the Laws for Faith-Based and Community Organizations, Federal Register, vol. 67, no. 241, December 16, 2002. Makerere Community Church The Makerere Community Church is another national leader in the abstinence-only push. Martin Ssempa, who is one of the writers of the Ugandan AB policy, directs the church and foundation. Ssempa leads the fundamentalist Makerere Christian Church and his policies fall in line. He takes a more extreme version of abstinence only sex education, sometimes speaking out directly against condoms and women's rights. His is a more outlying approach to abstinence-only and the lifestyle that he connects with it. Family Life Network The Family Life Network is a non-profit organization that teaches abstinence-only techniques alongside value based sexual education. Since 2002, they have reached at least 130,000 students in over 400 schools. A tactic readily put into place is to create abstinence-only in the public discussion is a signing of \\"True Love Waits\\" cards to pledge abstinence until marriage. Stephen Langa, the executive director, defines the Family Life Network as having four goals: bring back faith in the marriage institution; show the danger of sexual involvement; warn children on the dangers of globalization, such as pornography; and ask children to make a commitment of abstinence. Although Langa does not actively speak out against condom use, his beliefs when questioned contain false information about the protection provided by condoms against sperm and HIV transference. The Family Life Network receives money from foreign and Ugandan donors, but has not in the past received any contributions from the United States or PEPFAR. Effectiveness Looking at the effectiveness of abstinence-only sex education, it can't be measured in the knowledge received from the education, but instead the translation to the decisions that stem from the education. Three of these are STI/HIV prevention, the levels of teenagers participating in sexual activity and unplanned pregnancies. In terms of lowering new infection rates of STIs and HIV in particular, there is a mixed opinion on the influence of abstinence only. Edward C. Green, frequently consults for USAID has been published remarking that abstinence-only was the main proponent of the lowering of HIV/AIDS infection in Uganda and that condoms were not effective.Schoepf, Brooke Grundfest. \\"Uganda: lessons for AIDS control in Africa.\\" Review of African Political Economy (2003): 553-572. Furthermore, AIDS specialist Sophie Wacasa- Monacco explains that abstinence has played a very important role in the HIV decline, but only in conjunction with comprehensive education. It is the knowledge about HIV and STIs in general that allow for people to make educated decisions concerning their body and that of a prospective sexual partner. Abstinence is a good outlet to avoid sexual behaviour and therefore sexually transmitted infections, but without the full scope of the situation regarding sexual decisions, the consequences can be unclear and misleading. Abstinence- only sex education encourages youth to delay their sexual d√©but until marriage. Between the years of 1989 and 1995, Uganda saw large success with the employment of abstinence and subsequent HIV infection rates comparatively to their regional neighbours. In males aged 15‚Äì24 years old, there was a decrease from 60% to 23% participation in premarital sex. Similarly, females aged 15‚Äì25 saw a decrease from 53% to 16% in 1989 and 1995 respectively. This decrease coincided with a policy called zero-grazing, which emphasizes monogamous relationships and the faithfulness that is implied. Curiously, there were very few abstinence-only education programs in place during this decrease, despite the choice of abstinence from sexual intercourse having a significant decline. Abstinence-only sex education leaves women socially vulnerable.Schoepf, B. G. (2003). Uganda: lessons for AIDS control in Africa. Review of African Political Economy, 553‚Äì572. Women in Uganda have a diminished ability to hold dominion over their bodies. Young women are often coerced into relationships with older men, teachers, or \\"sugar daddies\\" that provide them with items that would not be accessible otherwise. Biologically speaking, if women or men break their abstinence vow, a woman is twice as likely to contract HIV due to her anatomy. Furthermore, abstinence only sex education doesn't teach ways to avoid HIV/AIDS infection after marriage. In Uganda, married women are one of the highest at risk populations. One of the biggest concerns is extra-marital sex that brings HIV into a seronegative relationship, in fact, in Uganda, men are twice as likely to infect their wives in marriage after entering into the relationship as seronegative. In addition, men are less likely to communicate the fact that they are infected with HIV to their partners. For example, of men that are hospitalized for HIV/AIDS, only 12% of the wives knew of their husbands' infection. When seronegative women engage in sexual intercourse with seropositive men, they are twice as likely to contract HIV than men in the same situation. In this respect, abstinence-only sex education neglects protecting anyone that does participate in sexual acts, and especially women, due to the gender power relations in Uganda. In abstinence-only sex education, there is not a program within to plan for pregnancy or control birth spacing. As the only tenant is to abstain from sexual relations until marriage, once in marriage this feature is not utilized. In Uganda, there are strict tradition surrounding sex post- partum and while breastfeeding.van de Walle, E., & van de Walle, F. (1988). Birthspacing and abstinence in Sub-Saharan Africa. International Family Planning Perspectives, 14(1), 25-6. Postpartum abstinence is a widely held belief and generally practiced. Unfortunately, this often leads to extramarital intercourse. In monogamous relationships, 31% of husbands abstain completely. This remaining 69% look elsewhere for sex, through polygamous relations, sex workers, or casual relationships. This abstinent period is not effective in the realm of preventing HIV from entering a seronegative relationship. In addition, in relationships that don't observe the post-partum abstinence, birth spacing becomes non-existent. In this case, many women find themselves pregnant in quick succession. Controversy Abstinence-only sex education became quite controversial in the examination of HIV/AIDS and pregnancy prevention due to the common link with morals and proselytizing. Often, abstinence-only sex education is taught from a Christian perspective and creates a connection with virginity and self-worth. In many cases, if someone slips from abstaining, they will then view their self-worth as less as they no longer have their virginity, leading to risky sexual behaviour. Many countries have pulled support for any abstinence-only education due to concerns with the idea of HIV prevention information being coupled with missionary work and message. Support has also been retracted when abstinence- only sex education was discovered to have been distributing false information regarding condom use and effectiveness. Abstinence-only sex education in Uganda has reportedly distributed the misinformation that there are tiny pores in condoms that allow the HIV virus to pass through, therefore deeming them unsafe to use against infection. It has also been disseminated that condoms are not effective birth control and the chance of getting pregnant is very high. This information that is easily disproven in the Global North, is difficult to combat in Uganda when it comes from political, spiritual and community leaders. This further stigmatizes condom use and lowers the likelihood that people engaging in sexual acts will use them. This misinformation is a large proponent against abstinence-only sex education as the organizations implementing the programs are unreliable or have proven to be in the past. =Socio-economic considerations= In many situations, the choice to abstain is non-existent. Many young girls and some boys are sex workers, selling their bodies to survive. In these high-risk environments, the participants do not have the ability to abstain or enter into a faithful monogamous relationship. Abstinence-only sex education in Uganda has been criticized for ignoring the thousands of citizens that are forced into sexual relations and therefore unprotected against HIV/AIDS. Due to abstinence-only sex education teaching abstinence until marriage as the only option, many sex workers do not know about or use condoms. This creates a breeding ground for HIV transmission. Abstinence-only sex education is woefully discriminatory against lower socioeconomic peoples. Outside of sex work, there exists young women and men that also cannot abstain due to social or financial pressure from older parties that act as \\"sugar mommies\\" and \\"sugar daddies\\".Hindin, M. J., & Fatusi, A. O. (2009). Adolescent sexual and reproductive health in developing countries: an overview of trends and interventions. International perspectives on sexual and reproductive health, 35(2), 58-62. Young men and women engage in sexual relationships in order to obtain items, treats or opportunities that they would not be able to otherwise receive. Abstinence- only sex education in Uganda disregards the existence of these relationships and does not provide any program or policy to protect against HIV/AIDS infection. =Non-recognized unions= Another criticism levelled at abstinence-only sex education in Uganda is the limiting language and subsequent exclusion that the policy promotes when addressing lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people. Abstinence-only sex education teaches to abstain from sex until marriage to a faithful partner. In Uganda, same-sex marriage is not recognized, and gay people can be penalized for coming out. In this way, some believe that abstinence-only sex education in Uganda discriminates against LGB individuals and does not provide them with adequate tools to combat HIV/AIDS infection. =Mutual exclusivity= Critics of abstinence-only sex education have made the point that abstinence-only truly curbs education and a well- rounded knowledge to fight HIV/AIDS infection. The implied mutual exclusivity of abstinence-only harms followers as they are not able to receive as much knowledge as possible. Leaders of the ABC method have highlighted the use of abstinence as a tool among others. The mutual exclusivity that so many abstinence-only teachers espouse does not need to exist. Abstinence can be an aspect of sex education without being the only curriculum in order to support an educated platform against HIV/AIDS infection in Uganda.

The centre spare wheels are unpowered, but can roll freely. An H-drive drivetrain is a system used for heavy off-road vehicles with 6√ó6 or 8√ó8 drive to supply power to each wheel station. H-drives do not use axles but rather individual wheel stations, usually carried on a punt chassis. A single differential splits the drive into separate left and right drive shafts, which each run fore and aft inside the bottom corners of the chassis. At each wheel station a bevel box drives the half shaft out to the wheel.  Advantages  * Each wheel station has independent suspension. * Greater ground clearance than conventional axles, as there is no central housing for the differential and final drive. * Lower unsprung weight as only the halfshafts are carried, not the centre differential of an axle. * Only one differential is required; however, this also requires that final drive to transmit all of the vehicle's torque. * Losing traction with one wheel still retains traction for the other wheels on that side; in effect, a longitudinal differential lock is permanently engaged. This does have the downside of driveline windup. H-drive is not commonly used for 4 wheel vehicles, as it is relatively complicated for small vehicles. It has been used most widely for military 6√ó6 chassis in the West. Vehicles of the Warsaw Pact, such as the Tatra 813 and MAZ-535 series, were instead based on narrow backbone chassis with a central propeller shaft.  DAF  Post-war H-drive was first developed by Hub van Doorne of the Dutch truck maker DAF. It was a derivative of their Trado conversion to produce a 6√ó4 off-road truck from a commercial 4√ó2 chassis. The Trado used a bogie rear suspension for both sets of rear wheels. This suspension, best known through the Scammell Pioneer of 1927, uses a single central axle, or driveshaft, that in turn drives two walking beams (balanceur, in Dutch) one on each side. The wheels are supported by overhung stub axles. The conversion added the walking beams to the ends of the original truck beam axle. From that point, the drive between the axles of each side was separated side by side. In 1938, a later version of the Trado 3 conversion added drive to the front wheels and so converted a 6√ó4 vehicle to 6√ó6 drive. Unlike most all-wheel-drive vehicles, the front axle was no longer a live beam axle with added articulation for steering, but used two separate drive shafts, one to each front hub. This principle of divided drive already being established for the front of the Trado, it was a minor step for van Doorne to divide the drive to the rear wheels as well. The DAF YA-328 used walking beams where the axle was no more than a pivot and the drive was supplied entirely by external longitudinal drive shafts, one on each side. As was usual for heavy vehicles of this period, the final drives and right-angle drive to the stub axles were combined through a worm gear box. This also had he advantage that it is easy to connect such boxes in series, using the rear end of the worm shaft as an output. YA-328 \\"Dikke Daf\\" DAF YA-328 ladder chassis, with outboard drive shafts This type of drive was used by DAF for several types of military vehicles: * The four-wheel drive DAF YA-054 (prototype) * The four-wheel drive DAF YA-126 * The 6-wheel drive DAF YA-328 * The 6-wheel drive (8√ó6) DAF YP-408 armoured personnel carrier DAF also made cars and were particularly known for their Variomatic continuously variable transmission, introduced with the DAF 600 in 1958. Although at a different scale to their military vehicles, these also used the unusual principle (outside DAF) of a side-by-side divided drive.  Daimler scout cars  Daimler Armoured Car The first major production of the H-drive and the greatest numbers produced were for the British Daimler Armoured Car and Daimler Dingo scout cars of WWII. As relatively small four- wheeled vehicles, these used a simplified layout of the H-drive. A single wide casing housed the differential and transfer box, with four articulated driveshafts running to bevel gear boxes inboard of each wheel. The use of bevel boxes, rather than DAF's worm gears, required the final drive reduction to be placed in the hubs, using an epicyclic reduction in each hub. This had the advantage of reducing torque in the driveshafts, allowing their unsprung weight to be made lighter. Ferret scout car, sectioned. The transfer case is painted (pale blue) and one driveshaft may be seen running forwards. In later years a similar layout would be used for the Ferret scout car. This had an even more compact layout, with the gearbox and transfer case within a single housing. The driveshafts were articulated with Tracta joints and epicyclic reduction gears in the hubs. An advantage of the H-drive was the low overall body height as the hull could sit between the suspension units, rather than above axles. This was demonstrated by the Canadian Lynx Scout Car, a derivative of the Daimler Dingo but using conventional Ford axles, which was a foot higher overall ( vs ).  Alvis FV600 series  Alvis Stalwart H-drive is probably best known today through the Alvis FV600 chassis, the Alvis Saladin armoured car, the Stalwart and family. The initial requirement was developed by the Department of Tank Design (DTD) immediately post-war and the six-wheel, all-driven configuration with all-round independent suspension chosen on the basis of experience with the best of WWII vehicles from four to eight wheels. The Saladin was designed as a 10-ton vehicle built on a welded steel punt chassis, forming an armoured monocoque hull. It was to use the equally new 8 cylinder Rolls-Royce B series engine, the B80. The contract for development of the FV600 chassis was awarded to Alvis in October 1947. By 1950, events of the Malayan Emergency had overtaken the British Army and with an urgent need for their first armoured personnel carrier, protected against guerilla ambush, the FV603 Saracen took priority over the Saladin. Saracen used an almost identical chassis and drivetrain to Saladin, although the engine was relocated from the rear to the front of the vehicle. The transmission used a 5-speed Wilson preselector gearbox with a fluid flywheel. Reverse gear was provided within the transfer box, allowing all five gears in either direction. The centre bevel boxes were included within the transfer box housing and had a slight overdrive to the drive shafts fore and aft. Each wheel station used double wishbones and torsion bars for suspension with four (three on the centre stations) shock absorbers. Steering was applied to the centre wheels and a lever arrangement moved the front wheels by a proportionately larger amount. A mark of the FV600's chassis' success was its application across a range of vehicles of varying weights and operational requirements, with great success at each and with little need for variation between them. One difference was in the braking system; the Saracen used drum brakes, the Saladin ring brakes. In time, the heavier Stalwart would require more effective disc brakes.  Driveline windup  Alvis Saladin, with white-marked hubs to show windup A drawback to the H-drive is the risk of driveline windup. When used for equally spaced wheels (i.e., rather than cargo trucks with close-set rear axles) the front two wheels are arranged so that both steer, the rear less so than the leading wheel. The varying track radii mean that when the vehicle drives in a curve on firm tarmac each wheel travels a different distance. As there is no differential action between the wheels on each side, this causes a lot of wind-up in the bevels and shafts. Standard operating instructions for the Stalwart recommend that after travelling some miles on firm ground, the vehicle should be bounced over a kerb or railway sleeper to lift wheels clear of the ground, one-by-one, so allowing them to spring back and release the windup. Excess windup could easily lead to a broken gear in the bevel or hub gearboxes. To indicate this, white lines were painted across the ends of the hubs. Normally the lines should be parallel but as windup occurred they would become misaligned, indicating the need to release this.

Richard Martin, and Audrey Long also star in the film. The screenplay was written by Norman Houston loosely based on the novel Wanderer of the Wasteland by Zane Grey, the film is about a young cowboy searching for the man who killed his father when he was a boy. With his lifelong friend at his side, he travels the country following his one clue‚Äîa distinctive brand on the killer's horse. When he tracks down the now elderly murderer, he finds he cannot kill him because of his feelings for the man's kindhearted daughter. Wanderer of the Wasteland was filmed on location in Lone Pine, California. Produced by RKO Radio Pictures, the film was released on September 28, 1945 in the United States. Plot In 1880 the Rafferty family is traveling by covered wagon across the Mojave Desert with their sheep when young Chito hears a voice crying out for help. A boy named Adam Larey stumbles in from the unforgiving sands of Death Valley and leads them to his parents' burning wagon, where they discover the body of his murdered father‚Äîthe mother having died earlier that day. The family's ten thousand dollars and a framed picture of his mother are missing. The only clue left behind is the crescent J brand on the murderer's dead horse. Angered by the loss, Adam vows to avenge his father's death. The kindhearted Raffertys adopt Adam and raise him as their own. Ten years later, Adam (James Warren) returns to Randsburg, California and the Raffery's sheep ranch after a year of wandering in search of his father's killer. Adam and Chito (Richard Martin) have remained close through the years, and Mama and Papa Rafferty are overjoyed at their stepson's homecoming. The next day in town, Adam notices the crescent J brand on a suitcase owned by Jeanie Collinshaw (Audrey Long) who is passing through town. When he questions her about the brand, her travel companion knocks him out, and the two board a stagecoach to Pichacho, Arizona. After he revives, Adam learns the stagecoach's destination and soon heads off to Arizona with Chito. When they arrive in Pichacho, Adam spots a horse bearing the crescent J brand outside a saloon and confronts the owner, Jeanie's reckless brother Jay Collinshaw (Robert Clarke). When Jay goes for his gun, Adam shoots him in the wrist in self-defense, then leaves the saloon with Chito and checks into a local hotel. Unknown to Jay, the card dealer and Guerd Eliott (Harry Woods), the forman at the Crescent J Ranch, have been cheating him in cards. That night Adam returns to his hotel and finds Jeanie waiting for him. She invites him to the ranch on behalf of her uncle, Jim Collinshaw (Robert Barrat), who owns the ranch. The next day they meet on the trail as planned and ride together to the ranch. Along the way a hidden gunman fires a shot at Adam but misses. Later at the ranch, Jeanie introduces Adam to Collinshaw, who is confined to a wheelchair. When Collinshaw offers Adam a job keeping Jay out of trouble, he accepts the offer as long as Chito is also hired. After Adam leaves, Collinshaw takes out a small framed photo of Adam's mother. The next day at the town hall, Adam examines the deed to the Crescent J Ranch and discovers that Collinshaw purchased the ranch ten years earlier for ten thousand dollars‚Äîthe exact amount stolen from Adam's family. Convinced that Collinshaw killed his father, Adam decides to confront the old man at Jeanie's birthday party later that night. At the party, Jay sneaks into his uncle's office and steals a thousand dollars and rides off to town to gamble. When Adam arrives, he meets with Collinshaw and accuses him of murdering his father. The old man acknowledges the crime, explaining that he killed his father out of revenge because he took away Adam's mother, the woman Collinshaw loved. He hands Adam the framed photo of his mother. As he's about to shoot Collinshaw, Adam thinks about Jeanie, whom he loves, and knows he cannot go through with his plan of revenge. Collinshaw shows Adam his will and confession. Realizing he can never live happily with Jeanie as long as Collinshaw is in their lives, he decides to return to California, but agrees to try and recover the stolen money from Jay. After Adam leaves, Guerd Eliott enters Collinshaw's office and learns that the old man is about to confess to the Larey murder and that he has left his entire estate to Adam in his will. Knowing the old man's confession would implicate Adam if he were murdered, Eliott shoots Collinshaw dead and then organizes a posse to arrest Adam for the crime. Meanwhile, at the saloon, Adam proves that the dealer has been cheating with marked cards and confiscates the money stolen from Jay. On his way out of town, Adam is arrested by Eliott and the posse and taken to jail. That night, Jeanie visits Adam in jail and reveals that her brother admitted to stealing the thousand dollars. She pleads with him to tell the truth and save himself, and stop protecting Jay. Soon Chito arrives and breaks Adam out of jail. Adam rides off alone, goes to Eliott's room, and forces him at gunpoint to accompany him on foot into the desert. Weakened and exhausted, Eliott admits that he murdered Collinshaw just as Jeanie, Chito, and the posse arrive. Jeanie shows everyone her uncle's confession, which contains on the back his last handwritten note acknowledging that Adam, out of his love for Jeanie, decided not to avenge the murder of his father. Sometime later, Chito, Adam, and Adam's new bride Jeanie return to Raffery's sheep ranch and are welcomed with love by Mama and Papa Rafferty. Adam assures Mama that this time he is home to stay.

Release Wanderer of the Wasteland was released by RKO Radio Pictures on June 1, 1945 in the United States. The film was reissued on June 16, 1951.Hulse, p. 331. Critical response Upon its theatrical release, Wanderer of the Wasteland received generally poor reviews. The reviewer for The New York Times called the film a \\"soporific little Western\\" and a \\"pallid and static picturization\\", while praising the performances of James Warren and Richard Martin who \\"supply the few flickers of spirit and humor\\" in the film.Hulse, p. 333. The reviewer for Variety magazine was equally unimpressed with the film, noting that it \\"doesn't offer much for fans of Western action and virility\\". In his review for AllMovie, Bruce Eder wrote that the film had promise and some good performances, but that it lacked character development and \\"could have been a better movie if the makers had been allowed to deliver something longer than 67 minutes\\". Despite these shortcomings, Eder appreciated the \\"engaging\\" performance of James Warren in his first starring role, as well as the \\"excellent support all around\\" from Richard Martin, Minerva Urecal, Harry D. Brown, and Audrey Long. Adaptations Wanderer of the Wasteland was the third film adaptation of Zane Grey's 1923 novel Wanderer of the Wasteland, which was published serially in McClure's magazine, beginning in May 1920. The first adaptation was a silent film made using Technicolor process 2 (an early Technicolor process), produced by Famous Players-Lasky in 1924, directed by Irvin Willat and starring Jack Holt, Noah Beery, and Billie Dove. A sound film adaptation was produced by Paramount in 1935, directed by Otho Lovering and starring Dean Jagger and Gail Patrick.

The company's flagship product is the \\"Micro 3D\\" or \\"Micro\\". The company was founded by David Jones and Michael Armani, natives of Maryland and both graduates of the University of Maryland, College Park. Armani has a Ph.D. in bioengineering and Jones has a computer science degree. Business model =Startup= Financing leading up to launch of M3D was obtained by the founders through personal finances amounting to . Subsequent funding for M3D was obtained through a Kickstarter campaign aimed at pre-sales of Micro units. The price point for the Micro was The price point for the earliest investors was $199. and the initial fundraising goal was , which was reached 11 minutes after the campaign's launch; the campaign went on to raise a total of through pre-sale of 11,000 units. In August 2016, M3D released a new 3D printer aimed at more experienced users named the M3D Pro. It ran on Kickstarter for 45 days until its conclusion on October 1, 2016 after raising over . As of May 2017, the M3D Pro had raised over . It was announced as publicly available for purchase with a 2-week delivery time. The announcement also revealed the option of \\"Using a 750-micron nozzle to fuse plastic layers together with a stronger bond, M3D believe the structural printing mode to be unique.\\" At the same time as the M3D Pro announcement, M3D also announced a 2017 version of the original Micro 3D Printer, the Micro+, which differs by having an ARM-core processor, enabling double the print speed, and better third party software integration, according to one article. As of this date (May 15th, 2020) M3D LLC has not delivered all the M3D Pro units to backers and after a host of issues and the companies inability to include or enable most of the important features promised in the campaign, the Pro was removed from the M3D web site. =Consumer market= The company's business model is to address the consumer market with a low cost, small form, simple to program unit. According to one report, 56,000 personal 3D printers were shipped globally in 2012 and the market is expected to grow to close to 2 million units by 2018. The Micro was described in October 2014 as \\"one of the lowest-priced personal 3-D printers that you don't have to build yourself.\\" The form of the unit is a 7-inch cube weighing 2 pounds. The initial Kickstarter price point of $299 has not been maintained, but increased to $349 by October 2014. This low cost was achieved through reduction of \\"power consumption by a factor of 10 compared to professional 3D printers\\", and the use of locally sourced, standardized electronics. =Consumables Market= The company also produces 3D Ink (Filament) used in 3D printing, including color changing 3D Ink which responds to temperature. In 2016 the company announced Tough 3D Ink, which \\"bonds seamlessly at full strength and can be as rigid or flexible as you want,\\" and ABS-R 3D Ink, an alternative to ABS with less odor that \\"bonds \\"better, warps less, and doesn‚Äôt require a heated print bed.\\" It is, however, not ABS, but regular PETG. =Industrial 3D Printing= In June, 2017 the company announced the Promega, its first large-format 3D printer. The printer has a 20\\" cubed outer dimension and offers a 15.3\\" cubed print volume, which its stated to be one of the most space efficient printers made. It also leverages a newly released \\"Compound\\" print head, which takes an input of two filaments and combines the flows into a single extrusion, allowing printing of individual materials or mixing of materials as long as they have similar printing temperatures. =Color 3D Printing= In April 2018, the company launched the Quad, a 4-color mixing extruder on Kickstarter. In June, 2018 the company announced the Crane Quad Color 3D Printer which also leverages the Duet3D Operations The company was founded in Bethesda, Maryland, but moved into new offices in Fulton, Maryland in late 2014. , M3D employed 25 people, with plans to multiply that number within a year. , M3D employed 70 people, citing local hires to fill positions in customer/technical support teams, marketing/design, engineering, software development, and management teams. Manufacture of the Micro units takes place in a plant in Howard County, Maryland which opened in October 2014.

It has only two characters, hence the subtitle \\"a comedietta for two voices\\". The first scene takes place aboard a liner, the second in a village shop. The characters are known only as \\"A\\" and \\"Z\\". Characters *A, a genteel young man *Z, a working class young woman Plot First conversation: On a cruise liner, A, an aesthetic young man, is writing. Z, a young woman, appears and tries to engage him in conversation, which he resists. He explains that he is writing about the cruise for the \\"Marco Polo Series of Chatty Guide Books\\". Z asks whether she will be included in his account of it, and replies that she will. She says she is thrilled, but must now give an account of herself, explaining that her father was a man of letters, as he was a postman. Second conversation: In a village shop, A enters. He is served by Z, but does not recognise her. He gets into a conversation with her, and talks about having met a persistent woman on a cruise. Z asks him to tell her more about this woman. She eventually persuades him to buy the shop. Third conversation: In the village shop again, A is now the owner of the shop, and is working on writing a checklist of reasons for staying there. Z argues with him about whether he is a shopkeeper or a poet. Eventually the pair decide they ought to be married. Z phones the church to make the arrangements. The play ends as she is about to tell the church their names. Productions The play was first performed on 16 April 1934 in Dallas, Texas, by the Little Theatre Company.Archibald Henderson, George Bernard Shaw: Man of the Century, Appleton-Century-Crofts, New York, 1956, p.575 Two weeks later, on 1 May, it was produced for the first time in England by the Wells Repertory Players, at Tunbridge Wells with Christopher Fry as A. Sybil Thorndike and Arthur Wontner gave the first London performance some months later at the Little Theatre in the Adelphi.Blanche Patch, Thirty Years with G. B. S., Dodd, Mead, New York, 1951, p.92 =Adaptations= Village Wooing was first shown on television in 1952 with Michael Golden as \\"A\\" and Ellen Pollock as \\"Z\\". There was an ITV version in 1979 starring Judi Dench and Richard Briers. There was also an Australian version filmed for TV in 1962 starring Michael Denison and Dulcie Gray. Origin Shaw was not very impressed with his own play, which he wrote while on a cruise. He wrote a letter to his friend Blanche Patch saying \\"Tell Barry Jackson -- but no one else -- that my efforts to write resulted in nothing at first but a very trivial comedietta in three scenes for two people which only Edith Evans could make tolerable.\\" Patch suggests that the play was influenced by his own experiences on the cruise and that the character of Z was based on Mrs. Jisbella Lyth, the postmistress in Shaw's village, Ayot St Lawrence. In a letter to Lillah McCarthy Shaw said that the male character was a \\"posthumous portrait\\" of Lytton Strachey.Holroyd, Michael, Bernard Shaw, Random House, 2011, p679. Mrs Lyth later commented that she went to see the play when she was told she'd inspired it, but she much preferred a play by John Galsworthy that was shown with it in a double-bill, , Shaw's friend Archibald Henderson agrees that the action in the village shop cum post-office was inspired by Shaw's experiences with Mrs. Lyth, but thinks the character of Z was mainly based on Shaw's wife Charlotte Payne-Townshend, Critical views Critic John Bertolini sees the play as an allegory of the relation between writer and text, \\"In Village Wooing Shaw dramatizes his own creative process as a writer of comedies, by figuring the subject of comedy, courtship and marriage, as the marriage of writer and text.\\" The marriage at the end is \\"the paradigmatic one of all written comedy, hence the play is the closed circle of its own writing and reading.\\"John A.

The region lies within the Tropoj√´ District and is part of a wider area between Albania and Kosovo that is historically known as Mal√´sia e Gjakov√´s (Highlands of Gjakova). Krasniqi stretches from the Valbon√´ river in the north to Lake Fierza in the south and includes the town Bajram Curri. Members of the Krasniqi tribe are also found in Kosovo and Northern Macedonia. Geography Valbona The region is called Krasniqe (Krasniqja in definite Albanian) and its people are called Krasniq√´. The Krasniqi region is situated in the District of Tropoja and stretches from the Montenegrin border in the north to Lake Fierza in the south, from the M√´rturi region in the west to the District of Has in the east, and includes most of the upper Valbona valley. It borders on the traditional tribal regions of Bugjoni to the south, Gashi to the northeast, Nikaj-M√´rtur to the west, and Byty√ßi to the east. The main settlements of the region are the town of Bajram Curri, Bujan, Shoshan, Kocanaj, Dragobia, Bradoshnic√´, Deg√´, Llugaj, Murataj, Margegaj, L√´kurtaj, Bunjaj. Krasniqi has its roots in the highlands of Gjakova, but over the centuries has spread to neighbouring areas. Thus, today many descendants of the Krasniqi fis are found within present-day Kosovo, especially in the western part (to the east of Krasniqi itself), having settled there since late 17th century. On the Kumanovo Black Mountain, descendants of the Krasniqi fis were recorded in the villages of Go≈°ince, Slupƒçane, Ala≈°evce (in Lipkovo) and Ruƒëince (in Staro Nagoriƒçane) in 1965. There are also Krasniqi tribe members in Morani village of Skopje.https://mk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9C%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8quote:–ò—Å–∞–ª–∞—Ä (–æ–¥ —Ñ–∏—Å–æ—Ç –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–∏—ú –≤–æ —Å–µ–≤–µ—Ä–Ω–∞ –ê–ª–±–∞–Ω–∏—ò–∞).}}  Origins  Oral traditions and fragmentary stories were collected and interpreted by writers who travelled in the region in the 19th century about the early history of Krasniqi. Johann Georg von Hahn recorded the first oral tradition about Krasniqi's origins from a Catholic priest named Gabriel in Shkodra in 1850. According to this account, the first direct male ancestor of the Krasniqi was Kast√´r Keqi, son of a Catholic Albanian named Keq who fleeing from Ottoman conquest settled in the Slavic-speaking area that would become the historical Piperi tribal region in what is now Montenegro. His sons, the brothers Laz√´r Keqi (ancestor of Hoti, Ban Keqi (ancestor of Triepshi), Merkota Keqi (ancestor of Mrkojeviƒái) and Vas Keqi (ancestor of Vasojeviƒái) had to abandon the village after committing murder against the locals, but Keq and his younger son Piper Keqi remained there and Piper Keqi became the direct ancestor of the Piperi tribe. The name of the first ancestor, Keq, which means bad in Albanian, is given in Mal√´sia to only children or to children from families with very few children (due to infant mortality). In those families, an \\"ugly\\" name (i √ßudun) was given as a spoken talisman to protect the child from the \\"evil eye. The name Kast√´r has also been recorded as Krasno, Kras or Krasto. The name Kast√´r and its variants correspond to a settlement that appears in the Decani chrysobulls of 1330 as Krastavljane and in the defter of the sanjak of Scutari in 1485 as Hrasto. This toponym's etymology probably comes from the Slavic word hrasto (oak). It had ten households and its head household was that of Petri, son of Gjonima. One of the household heads, Nika Gjergj Bushati was related to the Bushati fis. Villages that later were part of Krasniqi that appear in the defter of 1485 are Shoshan (20 households) and Dragobia (six households). These villages were not part of the same community or the same administrative unit as other tribes of northern Albania and Montenegro like Hoti or Piperi which were in the process of their final formation at that time. It is also unclear what the relation of the people of these settlements is to the first historical ancestor of Krasniqi who lived about 70 years later. Krasniqi is a fis (tribe) of two different patrilineal ancestries. Most brotherhoods of Krasniqi come from Kol√´ Mekshi who lived in the mid 16th century. After 1550, he and his brother Nik√´ Mekshi are recorded as the first, historical, direct ancestors of the Krasniqi and Nikaj tribes. To Kol√´ Mekshi trace their descend the Kolmekshaj brotherhoods and their branches. They form the population of Shoshan and Dragobia. They also founded Bradoshnic√´, Deg√´, Kocanaj, Murataj and also form half of the village of Margegaj. The other half of Margegaj descend from its founder Mark Gega. The inhabitants of Kolgecaj (renamed to Bajram Curri in 1957), L√´kurtaj and Bunjaj stem from other brotherhoods that were unrelated to the Kolmekshaj, but later were included in the tribe. History Albanian bayraks as of 1918. Krasniq covers section 33 of the map. As for much of its history Krasniqi was a Catholic community, its early history is traced through official reports of Catholic clergy to the Vatican. The tribe's name was recorded for the first time in 1634 as Crastenigeia in a report of the Catholic bishop Gjergj Bardhi. Four years later, his nephew bishop Frang Bardhi passed through Krasniqi territory and noted that they had their own church. The settlement of Krasniqi at that point had 60 households with 475 people. He also remarked the extreme poverty that the Krasniqi were enduring. Heavy taxation against Catholics and Ottoman repression kickstarted the conversion of the population to Islam at the end of the 17th century. This process was mostly finished by the middle 19th century, but the Krasniqi community in and around the towns of Gjakova and also Prizren remained Catholic. From these Krasniqi families stem Catholic archbishop Matej Krasniqi and apostolic vicar Gasp√´r Krasniqi. The Catholics of Krasniqi were put under the Austrian kultursprotektorat in the late 1760s, which gave some religious freedom to Catholics in the Ottoman Empire under the state protection of the Austrian Empire. This allowed for the Catholic parishes of Gjakova and Prizren to rebuild their churches and schools. Traditions The tribe's (historical) patron saint is St. George, whom they still revere after Islamization.

The game is notable for being one of the first commercial RPGs to take place in Ancient India. The game was released on Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux platforms on July 23, 2014.  Gameplay  Unrest is a role-playing video game. It plays in a 2-dimensional perspective, with graphics designed to look hand-drawn. A large portion of the game involves making dialogue choices to influence NPCs and progress the story. NPCs all possess and react based on three values: Friendship, Respect, and Fear. Combat is relatively rare, always avoidable, and very risky. However, playable character death does not result in a Game Over. Instead, the game proceeds to the next chapter, with the previous playable character's death influencing how the story ultimately plays out.  Plot  The game takes place in ancient India in a time of great social upheaval. It also contains some fantasy elements, such as the Naga, a race of snakelike humanoids. The game's story is divided into eight chapters, with players taking on the role of five different characters, who each have their own back story. The playable characters include a peasant girl who doesn't want to go through her arranged marriage, an elderly priest, the chief of the mercenary guild, and the sole heir of the former royal family who now lives as a street urchin.  Development  The developers posted the game on Kickstarter. The campaign started with an initial goal of US$3,000 to finish the game. On the second day of the campaign, the goal had been met. The developers included stretch goals in the campaign which included enhancing the visuals and additional chapters. The campaign ended on June 21, 2013, with Unrest raising $36,251. On August 3, 2020, Arvind Raja Yadav from Pyrodactyl Games released the source code for the game under the MIT License on GitHub.  Reception  Unrest received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Hardcore Gamer gave it a score of three-and-a- half stars out of five and called it \\"a choice-driven RPG with little combat to speak of that touches on relevant social issues.\\" National Post gave it six out of ten and called it \\"a bold, powerful, and interesting game. I'm just not sure how much fun it is.\\" Common Sense Media also gave it three stars out of five and said, \\"There's plenty to admire about this daring, story-driven RPG experience, but it's not quite as accessible or polished as one might have hoped.\\" Paste gave it a similar score of six out of ten and said, \\"For a game that sets out with intent to include elements rarely embraced in games, Unrest comes across as an underwhelming mixture of a smartly constructed core without any layers to complement it.\\"  References   External links    2014 video games Commercial video games with freely available source code Crowdfunded video games Fantasy video games Indie video games Kickstarter-funded video games Linux games MacOS games Open-source video games Rebellions in fiction Role-playing video games Single-player video games Software using the MIT license Video games based on Hindu mythology Video games developed in India Video games featuring female protagonists Video games set in India Video games with alternate endings Windows games ","title":"Unrest (video game)"},{"id":"42470713","text":"Ahuriri Harbour also known as Ahuriri Lagoon or locally just Ahuriri, was a former estuary and tidal lagoon located on the Eastern Coastline of New Zealand's North Island, just north of present-day Napier.

Ahuriri was the final stop for the Tutaekuri and Waiohinganga Rivers, which made the lagoon and surrounding lands a sacred place to the native MƒÅori. The European settlers also realised the importance of the area, particularly economic wise and Napier was soon settled. Cultural History Napier was settled on an island in the harbour, known as Scinde Island (present day Bluff Hill) and soon became a prosperous region on New Zealand's East Coast. Napier's growth then haltered, as there was not enough flat land to construct on. The southern end of Ahuriri stretched between Scinde Island and the mainland, separating Napier from the settlement of Taradale and many people moving into the region chose Taradale over Napier because of the abundance of land. In the 1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake much of Ahuriri was uplifted, exposing roughly 30 km (3000ha) of seabed. This included a new land bridge between Napier and Taradale and in the years to come the towns grew in size. In 1968, Taradale amalgamated with Napier, forming Napier City.

(Private collection) Polidoro de Rienzo da Lanciano (Lanciano, 1515 - 1565) was an Italian painter. Relatively little is known of his life. He was born in Lanciano, a town that is a few miles inland from Ortona, a port on the Adriatic Sea. This is in the Abruzzi region of Italy, lying southeast of Pescara. His grandfather, Alessandro Rienzo, was a ceramic painter in Lanciano. Based on Venetian documents Polydoro's birthdate is taken to be 1515. At an early age he apparently showed great artistic talent. and for that reason he moved to Venice, the center of art in that region of Italy, at a young age. There he assumed a Venetian form for his name, Lanzani. His first mention in official Venetian documents is 1536, when he would have been 21 years of age. He probably came to Venice at least five years prior to that in order to begin his artistic training. His name appears as a witness to a document in the years 1536 and 1549. His Last Will and Testament bears his signature, and is dated 20 July 1565. He died the following day, with his age reported as 50. He likely worked as an assistant to Titian (1488-1576) for many years, especially given the close resemblance of his style with that of the Venetian master. This would have been in the 1530s and possibly early 1540s. It is not known whether he then set up his own studio, but that was common practice. Polidoro was also influenced by Bonifacio Veronese (1487-1557), Pordenone (1484-1539), and later possibly Paolo Veronese (1528-1588).Collection of Mediaeval and Renaissance Paintings, Volume 1, by Fogg Art Museum, page 233.Giulia Viva, review (2013) by Leo Marchetti of book by Vincenzo Mancini titled Polidoro da Lanciano (Rocco Carabba editore) financed by the Banca Popolare di Lanciano e Sulmona.

History In 1990, the Rembrandt toothpaste brand was developed and owned by closely held Den-Mat Corp, which had been founded in 1974 by dentist Dr. Robert Ibsen. In 2003, it had about $73 million in sales. In 2004, Gillette purchased the Rembrandt brand. As part of Procter & Gamble's acquisition of Gillette in 2005, the company was required by the Federal Trade Commission to divest itself of Rembrandt. Consequently, it sold Rembrandt to Johnson & Johnson's McNeil-PPC division. That year, Rembrandt had sales that likely exceeded $100 million. Products Rembrandt Intense Stain and Rembrandt Deeply White toothpaste contain hydrated silica. In a study published in 2011 in the Journal of Clinical Dentistry, Rembrandt Intense Stain was found to have a relative dentin abrasion of around 90 (mildly abrasive) and was in the middle of those tested in terms of cleaning. Rembrandt offered Canker Sore Toothpaste for the benefit of \\"canker sore\\" (i.e. aphthous stomatitis) sufferers in 1993, reformulated the toothpaste in 2008, and changed its name to Rembrandt's Gentle White in 2012. Johnson & Johnson marketed it as a whitening toothpaste that was gentle enough for people whose mouths were prone to canker sores. The company targeted, and the toothpaste was used by, canker sore sufferers. Approximately 20% of the general population suffer from canker sores, which can make eating, swallowing, or talking painful. Rembrandt's Gentle White does not contain sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), an ingredient that a Swedish study showed was dramatically correlated with canker sores. Rembrandt discontinued the canker sore toothpaste line in 2012. This led to the three-ounce tube of the toothpaste, which had formerly sold for $6.99, being instead sold for approximately $50 on eBay in 2014.

Meaning The word, ChintƒÅ (‡§ö‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§æ), is derived from the root ‚Äì ‡§ö‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•ç meaning - to think, consider, reflect, ponder over; and by itself means ‚Äì thinking, thought, sad or sorrowful thought, reflection, consideration, anxiety Nature ChintƒÅ is one of thirty-three VyabhichƒÅri bhavas, the transient feelings which rise irregularly and support the permanent basic sentiments, because of their fleeting nature they are also called sanchƒÅri bhavas. Manas, which is the ordinary mental equipment of the individual, is the perceiving and arranging mind. In Samkhya system it refers to the personal organ of thought, not diffused like theƒÅtman but localized in the individual. Manas has its own illumination (chetas) which gives man awareness or consciousness (chetna), faculties of perception (pratyaksha), thought (chintƒÅ), imagination (kalpanƒÅ) and volition (praytana). ChintƒÅ is the faculty whereby the current of thought dwells, thinks and contemplates upon the subject so recalled by Samarnam (memory), and previously known and determined by buddhi (intellect) Implication Rishi Shant VaikhƒÅnsa of the Rig Veda (IX.66.25) in a mantra addressed to Soma tells us that : ‡§™‡§µ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§ú‡§ô‡•ç‡§ò‡•ç‡§®‡§§‡•ã ‡§π‡§∞‡•á‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ ‡§Ö‡§∏‡•É‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§§ : ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§∞‡§æ ‡§Ö‡§ú‡§ø‡§∞‡§æ‡§∂‡•ã‡§ö‡§ø‡§∑‡§É |when the material darkness is dispelled by the powerful purifying (‡§™‡§µ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø) light emanating from the divine source, coinciding therewith is also the destruction of the darkness of the mind (‡§ú‡§ô‡•ç‡§ò‡•ç‡§®‡§§‡§É) (which darkness is ignorance), then that light (‡§ú‡•Ä‡§∞‡§æ‡§É) (the bright divine source) which is Brahman (‡§Ö‡§ú‡§ø‡§∞‡§æ‡§∂‡•ã‡§ö‡§ø‡§∑‡§É) is seen which delivers the yogins beyond all (imaginable) folds (barriers) of existence, which existence with reference to the body is gross but is subtle with reference to the mind. The epithet ‚Äì Soma as the ever glowing one, is used with regard to Agni, Aditya and Brahman. Sankara in his Vivekachudamani (Sloka 539) uses the term ‚Äì ‡§ö‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§æ‡§∂‡•Ç‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Æ‡•ç (chintashoonyam) as meaning without anxiety or worry (chinta here means anxiety). Chinmayananda Saraswati explains that it refers to the man of perfection to whom no thought comes to mind so as to disturb and destroy him because worry cannot reach him who refuses to worry. In Vedanta, Chinta, along with and therefore interconnected with vƒÅsanƒÅ and karma, is a factor which represents the chain of causation. Chinta and karmas create powerful vasanas and by themselves are the effects of vasanas. Vasanas are not destroyed if chinta and karmas are not destroyed. Significance Gaudapada in his Karika on the Mandukya Upanishad (Slokas III.31-48) explains that all that there is, is perceived by the mind; when the mind ceases to be (stops thinking) duality is not perceived; the mind ceases to think as a consequence of the realisation of the Truth that it is the Self, it becomes a non-perceiver. Truth is known through knowledge and both are birth-less; the mind that does not lose itself when under control becomes the fearless Brahman possessed of the light of Consciousness; then all mentation (‡§ö‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§æ) stops, he states:- : ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§≠‡§ø‡§≤‡§æ‡§™‡§µ‡§ø‡§ó‡§§‡§É ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§ö‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§æ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•Å‡§§‡•ç‡§•‡§ø‡§§‡§É : ‡§∏‡•Å‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§∂‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§É ‡§∏‡§ï‡•É‡§ú‡•ç‡§ú‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã‡§§‡§ø‡§É ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ß‡§ø‡§∞‡§≤‡•ã‡§Ω‡§≠‡§Ø‡§É |: \\" The Self is free of all sense- organs, and is above all internal organs. It is supremely tranquil, eternal effulgence, divine absorption, immutable, and fearless. \\" In this verse, the word chinta derived in the sense of that by which things are thought of, means - the intellect. Gaudapada calls the moment of direct apprehension of the Paramatman (whose presence is known through the mind) the state of the highest Samadhi in which all talk is at an end, all anxiety is at an end.

In the 13th century, another type of Kormchaia appeared, where some elements of the Bulgarian and Serbian Kormchiye Books were consolidated. This was so-called Saint Sophia version, or the Synodic version (named from the place of discovery in the St. Sophia Cathedral of Novgorod and then was keeping in the Synodic library in Moscow). It was also supplemented by Russian articles: Russkaya Pravda, the church statutes of the princes Vladimir and Yaroslav, the rules of the 1274 Council and others. Synodic Kormchaia has been widespread and is known in a large number of copies. In the late 15th and early 16th centuries, Kormchiye books were revised due to the large number of variant readings. In 1650, so-called Joseph Kormchaia (of Patriarch Joseph) was published in a printing, it was based on Zakonopravilo of Saint Sava. In 1653, was published Nikon Kormchaia (of Patriarch Nikon). In 1787, so-called Ekaterina Kormchaia was. The latest edition of Kormchaia was in 1816. Since 1816 Book of Rules (Kniga pravil) are publishing instead of Kormchiye Books in Russia.

On March 27, 2014, 145,604 acres (589 km¬≤) of federal land in Clark County were temporarily closed for the \\"capture, impound, and removal of trespass cattle.\\" BLM officials and law enforcement rangers began a roundup of such livestock on April 5, and Cliven Bundy's son, Dave, was arrested. On April 12, 2014, a group of protesters, some of them armed, approached the BLM \\"cattle gather.\\" Sheriff Doug Gillespie negotiated with Bundy and newly confirmed BLM director Neil Kornze, who elected to release the cattle and de-escalate the situation. As of the end of 2015, Cliven Bundy continued to graze his cattle on federal land and still had not paid the grazing fees. The ongoing dispute started in 1993, when, in protest against changes in grazing rules, Bundy declined to renew his permit for cattle grazing on BLM-administered public lands near Bunkerville, Nevada. According to Bundy, the federal government lacks the constitutional authority to own vast tracts of lands, an argument repeatedly rejected by federal courts. According to the BLM, Bundy continued to graze his cattle on public lands without a permit. In 1998, Bundy was prohibited by the United States District Court for the District of Nevada from grazing his cattle on an area of land later called the Bunkerville Allotment. In July 2013, federal judge Lloyd D. George ordered Bundy to refrain from trespassing on federally administered land in the Gold Butte area of Clark County. Cliven and his son Ammon Bundy, and their supporters, have claimed that the federal government lacks the authority to manage public lands. These arguments have been repeatedly rejected by legal scholars and federal courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court; the property clause of the United States Constitution grants plenary authority to Congress to manage federal property, including land.Public Land Transfer Laws: Not Constitutional Then, Not Constitutional Now . Graybill, Raph. American Constitution Society, 11 March 2015Are U.S. Public Lands Unconstitutional?. John D. Leshy, Hastings Law Journal vol. 69:499  Background  = History = federally owned land in the United States. The area in yellow represents land managed by the Bureau of Land Management The land to which Cliven Bundy claims ancestral rights was originally inhabited by the Moapa Paiute people. In 1848, as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the United States purchased from Mexico land that is now the southwestern region of the United States. Since then, the government has continuously owned land in what is now Nevada, including the Bunkerville Allotment.Gray, Tom. \\"Teaching With Documents: The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo\\". National Archives and Records Administration. Retrieved April 24, 2014. The Nevada Territory was partitioned in 1861 from the Utah Territory, and became a state in 1864. The original settlers in the 1840s and 1850s were Mormons from Utah and southern small-time farmers and ranchers from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi. After the end of the American Civil War, much of the land was settled by rural farmers, squatters and small-time cattle ranchers from Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri and Kansas, escaping from the post‚ÄìCivil War Reconstruction and the associated violence and displacement. Since 1934 federal rangelands in Nevada have been managed principally by either the Bureau of Land Management or its predecessor, the United States Grazing Service, or the United States Forest Service. , 47.8 million acres (more than two-thirds of Nevada's 70.3 million acres) were managed by the BLM. Throughout the nation, the BLM manages nearly 18,000 grazing permits and leases, of which about 700 are in Nevada. The season of use and the details of forage are stipulated in permits and leases; thus federal control can be exerted on the land used for grazing. = Permits = Under BLM permits first issued in 1954, Bundy grazed his cattle legally and paid his grazing fees on the Bunkerville Allotment until 1993. In 1989, the federal government declared the desert tortoise an endangered species and began negotiating a habitat conservation plan in Clark County, Nevada, to meet the needs of both the tortoise and the people, such as Bundy, who were using the land. In mid-1991, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service approved a short-term conservation plan that allowed for development of about 22,000 acres of tortoise habitat in and around Las Vegas in exchange for strict conservation measures on 400,000 acres of federal BLM land south of the city. This included the elimination of livestock grazing and strict limits on off-road vehicle use in the protected tortoise habitat. In 1993, a permanent conservation plan was put into place that more than doubled the conservation area, and included the Bunkerville Allotment. Unlike many ranchers, Bundy refused to sell his grazing privileges back to the federal government. Instead, as a protest, Bundy did not pay his renewal fees in 1993. His permit was canceled in 1994. Although the agency made several attempts to have Bundy renew the permit, he declared that he no longer recognized the BLM's authority to regulate grazing, and asserted that he had \\"vested rights\\" to graze cattle on the land. Federal courts have consistently ruled against Bundy, ruling him a trespasser with no right to graze on federal land. The courts authorized the BLM to remove Bundy's cattle and to levy damages for his unauthorized use. Bundy accumulated more than $1 million in unpaid grazing fees and court-ordered fines. The Portland Oregonian newspaper reported in May 2014 that the amount that Bundy owed stood in \\"stark contrast\\" to the situation in Oregon, where just 45 of the state's roughly 1,100 grazing permit holders collectively owed $18,759 in past-due payments to the BLM, and only two ranchers had unpaid fees more than 60 days past due. Excluding Bundy's unpaid fees, the total of all late grazing fees owed nationwide to the BLM was only $237,000. = Bundy's worldview = Cliven Bundy in 2014 Bundy has said that he does not recognize federal police power over land that he believes belongs to the \\"sovereign state of Nevada.\\" He also denies the jurisdiction of the federal court system over Nevada land and he filed an unsuccessful motion to dismiss the BLM case against him, saying that the federal courts have no jurisdiction because he is a \\"citizen of Nevada, not the territory of Nevada\\". and that federally owned land in Nevada actually belongs to the state.Bundy doesn't understand Constitution, Ian Bartrum, Las Vegas Review-Journal, April 27, 2014 According to The Guardian, Bundy told his supporters that \\"We definitely don't recognize [the BLM director's] jurisdiction or authority, his arresting power or policing power in any way,\\" and in interviews he used the language of the sovereign citizen movement, thereby gaining the support of members of the Oath Keepers, the White Mountain Militia and the Praetorian Guard militias. The FBI considers sovereign citizen extremism a domestic terrorism threat. J. J. MacNab, who writes for Forbes about anti-government extremism, described Bundy's views as inspired by the sovereign citizen movement, whose adherents believe that the county sheriff is the most powerful law-enforcement officer in the country, with authority superior to that of any federal agent, local law-enforcement agency or any other elected official. On April 12, 2014, Bundy \\"ordered\\" Clark County Sheriff Doug Gillespie to confront the federal agents, disarm them and deliver their arms to Bundy within an hour of his demand, and later expressed disappointment that Gillespie did not comply. The Southern Poverty Law Center has described Bundy's views as closely aligned with those of the Posse Comitatus organization, and says that such views focus on secession, nullification, state sovereignty and the principles of the Tenther movement. Bundy was at first praised by some Republican politicians and conservative personalities. On April 19, 2014, Bundy said that \\"the negroes\\" ‚Äúwere basically on government subsidy, so now what do they do?‚Äù Bundy said. ‚ÄúThey abort their young children, they put their young men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton. And I‚Äôve often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy? They didn‚Äôt get no more freedom. They got less freedom.‚Äù After his comments, Bundy was repudiated by some conservative politicians and talk-show hosts who had previously supported him. Many condemned his remarks as racist. In May 2014, Bundy changed his political affiliation from the Republican party to the Independent American Party. =Cancellation of 1996 cattle removal= Alan O'Neill, superintendent of the Lake Mead National Recreation Area from 1987 through 2000, is a retired National Park Service official whose tenure at Lake Mead included the early years of the Bundy dispute. He wrote that he was \\"told to back off at one point because of concern for violence\\". In 1996, the National Park Service made plans to remove cattle that were illegally trespassing in Lake Mead NRA. O'Neill recalls veiled threats similar to those made against government workers during the 2014 round-up. Against this background, he says, \\"the U.S. attorney's office told us to back off,\\" and the operation was canceled. = Grazing on federal rangeland in Nevada = The Taylor Grazing Act of 1934 (TGA) regulates grazing on public lands (excluding Alaska) to improve rangeland conditions. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages about 167 million acres (676,000 km¬≤) of publicly owned rangeland in the United States, with the United States Forest Service managing approximately 95 million acres (380,000 km¬≤) more. Permittees on federal rangelands are required to pay a fee, and the permit cannot exceed ten years but is renewable.43 U.S. Code ¬ß¬ß 315-316o (P.L. 73-482)  United States v. Bundy  The case of United States v. Bundy played out over many years in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada. It involved court orders, injunctions, and notices. Bundy argued pro se (without a lawyer) that the land belongs to the state. The Bureau of Land Management was represented by the U.S. Attorney's Office for Nevada and the United States Department of Justice. District Judge Larry R. Hicks ruled that the land on which Bundy was grazing his cattle was indeed owned by the federal government, that Bundy had not been paying to use it as he should have been, that Bundy was trespassing, and that the government had the right to enforce the injunctions against trespass. Hicks found that Bundy had repeatedly violated court orders. =1998‚Äì2012: Legal actions= United States v. Bundy \\"arose out of Bundy's unauthorized grazing of his livestock on property owned by the United States and administered by the Department of the Interior through the BLM and the National Park Service\\". On November 3, 1998, United States District Judge Johnnie B. Rawlinson \\"permanently enjoined (Bundy) from grazing his livestock within the Bunkerville Allotment (\\"The Allotment\\"), and shall remove his livestock from this allotment on or before November 30, 1998 ... (and) ordered that Plaintiff shall be entitled to trespass damages from Bundy in the amount of $200.00 per day per head for any livestock belonging to Bundy remaining on the Bunkerville Allotment after November 30, 1998.\\" Rawlinson wrote that \\"[t]he government has shown commendable restraint in allowing this trespass to continue for so long without impounding Bundy's livestock.\\" This sentence was restated on October 8, 2013, by District Judge Larry R. Hicks. On September 17, 1999, after Bundy failed to comply with the court's earlier order(s), the court issued another order directing Bundy to comply with the 1998 permanent injunction and modifying the trespass damages owed.Knightly, Arnold M. (April 11, 2014). \\"Cliven Bundy supporters bring cattle roundup protest to Las Vegas police headquarters\\". Las Vegas Review-Journal. =2012‚Äì2015: Legal actions= Bundy's cattle expanded into additional public land over the years. A planned April 2012 roundup of his cattle was called off when Bundy made violent threats against the Bureau of Land Management. The bureau's requests for assistance from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department were met by a demand of Sheriff Doug Gillespie that the bureau seek a new warrant because, he said, the original 1998 order had become \\"stale\\". Because of Gillespie's demand, in May 2012 the government filed a second United States v. Bundy case, seeking renewed enforcement authority for the original court orders along with relief for Bundy's trespassing on a new set of additional lands not covered by the original 1998 ruling: \\"including public lands within the Gold Butte area that are administered by the BLM, and National Park System land within the Overton Arm and Gold Butte areas of the Lake Mead National Recreation Area.\\" On December 21, 2012, the United States moved for summary judgment in this new case, and this motion was granted in an order signed by Senior District Judge Lloyd D. George on July 9, 2013. The ruling permanently enjoined Bundy and his cattle from trespassing on the New Trespass Lands. Another order was issued by Judge Larry R. Hicks on October 8, 2013, which stemmed from the earlier 1998 civil action against Bundy. The order allows the United States to \\"protect the ... Bunkerville Allotment against ... trespass\\" by Bundy and \\"to seize and remove to impound\\" any of his cattle that remain in those areas. Court judgments against Bundy's claims The Cliven Bundy family owns a 160-acre farm southwest of Bunkerville, which serves as headquarters and base property for the family's ranching operation on nearby public lands. The farm property was purchased by the Bundy family in 1948, after they moved from Bundyville, Arizona, and Bundy has claimed that he inherited \\"pre-emptive grazing rights\\" on public domain land because some of his maternal grandmother's ancestors had kept cattle in the Virgin Valley beginning in 1877. Bundy alternatively argued in legal cases that federal grazing rules infringe on Nevada's rights. =Claim of inherited grazing rights= There are no legally recognized inherited grazing rights, preemptive rights, special rights, or grandfathered public-domain land-use rights held by the Bundy family or Bundy's ancestors. Bundy lost his special-rights arguments in the United States v. Bundy cases. Bundy had only base property and normal AUM grazing-allotment permits, like the permits of thousands of other ranchers throughout the western United States. The court found that Bundy and his father actually first began grazing their cattle on the Bunkerville Allotment in 1954 and used it for several years. They paid for cattle grazing again from 1973 until 1993, when Bundy paid the last fees for his final grazing application for the period from December 1, 1992, through February 28, 1993. On January 24, 1994, the Bureau of Land Management delivered a Proposed Decision Order to Remove and Demand for Payment to Bundy by placing it on the dashboard of Bundy's vehicle while he was in the vehicle. BLM officials allege that Bundy became agitated, descended from his truck and accused the BLM of harassing him. He then returned to his truck, threw the proposed order out of the window and drove away. One of Bundy's sons then picked up the document, tore it to pieces and threw it on the ground. On February 17, 1994, the BLM issued a final decision canceling Bundy's range-grazing permit. Bundy subsequently informed the BLM in several administrative notices that he intended to graze cattle \\"pursuant to my vested grazing rights\\". Bundy failed to demonstrate the existence of any such special rights when given an opportunity to do so in court. =Claim of lack of federal jurisdiction= Bundy lost in U.S. District Court on all his arguments regarding states' rights and jurisdiction in the United States v. Bundy cases. He had argued that the U.S. District Court for Nevada lacked jurisdiction because the U.S. did not own the public lands in question. The court ruled that \\"the public lands in Nevada are the property of the United States because the United States has held title to those public lands since 1848, when Mexico ceded the land to the United States.\\" Bundy had argued that the Disclaimer Clause of the Nevada Constitution carries no legal force. Bundy also argued that the United States' exercise of ownership over public-domain lands violated the Equal Footing Doctrine, that Article Four of the United States Constitution (the Property Clause) applied only to federal lands outside the borders of states, that the government had based its authority to sanction him on the Endangered Species Act (as opposed to an action for trespass) and that Nevada's open-range statute excused Bundy's trespass. These arguments were rejected by the court. Lawmakers in about a half-dozen states have adopted resolutions which assert that states have sovereignty over federal land within states. Legal scholar Rob Natelson, formerly of the University of Montana, has argued that the federal government is required to dispose of public land within states, with few exceptions.What Does the Constitution Say About Federal Land Ownership?. Natelson, Rob. Independence Institute, 6 February 2016 However, these claims have been repeatedly rejected by federal courts, citing the Property Clause's clear grant of power to Congress to manage federal property, including land.No, federal land transfers are not in the Constitution. Gray, Bryce. High Country News, 4 February 2016. Although challenged periodically in court, federal application of the Property Clause has been consistently supported in a chain of legal precedent that extends back to 1840. Citing the 1840 Supreme Court case, United States v. Gratiot, which ruled that \\"the power over the public lands is vested in Congress by the Constitution, without limitation,\\" Yale University legal scholar Raph Graybill wrote that \\"the Constitution grants the United States exclusive legal control over American public lands.\\" University of Utah law professor Robert Keiter argued that legal efforts to demand transfer of federal public lands were not only futile as a matter of law, but counterproductive as well‚Äîby declaring federal agencies to be the enemy, \\"the Transfer Movement does more harm than good to the federal-state relationship needed for effective public land management.\\"A Legal Analysis of the Transfer of Public Lands Movement. Wallace Stegner Center, University of Utah. 27 October 2014 In the Fort Leavenworth Railroad Co. v. Lowe Supreme Court decision (1885), Justice Stephen J. Field wrote that the authority of the federal government over territories is \\"necessarily paramount\\", but that once a territory is organized as a state and admitted to the union on equal footing with other states, the state government assumes concurrent jurisdiction over federal lands, and the federal government then has the rights of an \\"individual proprietor\\" over lands it owns, unless there has been a formal cession of jurisdiction over a given area by the state under the Enclave Clause.Property Clause. Heritage Institute retrieval date=7 October 2017 The power of proprietary rights are those of a property owner, and in Utah Power & Light Co. v. United States, a unanimous Supreme Court ruled in 1917 that as regards federal public lands, \\"the power of Congress is exclusive, and that only through its exercise in some form can rights in lands belonging to the United States be acquired.\\"Utah Power & Light Co. v. United States, 243 U.S. 389. (1917) This was further reinforced in 1920 when the Court ruled in Cameron v. United States that the president's use of the Antiquities Act to set aside national monuments was constitutionalCameron v. United States, 252 U.S. 450. (1920) and in 1922 in McKelvey v. United States, where the Court ruled that \\"It is firmly settled that Congress may prescribe rules respecting the use of the public lands. It may sanction some uses and prohibit others, and may forbid interference with such as are sanctioned\\" and that \\"states may prescribe police regulations applicable to public land areas, so long as the regulations are not arbitrary or inconsistent with applicable congressional enactments.\\"McKelvey v. United States, 260 U.S. 353 (1922)  Bureau of Land Management actions  BLM Trespass Cattle Closure Map Apr 11, 2014 The BLM was tasked with environmental assessment and various enforcement issues regarding the cattle-trespass injunctions. During March and April 2014, it closed some areas of government lands during the planning for roundup of the trespass cattle owned by Bundy. In early April, \\"just before the roundup got underway, a survey conducted by helicopter counted 908 head of cattle scattered across roughly 1,200 square miles of remote mountains and desert managed by the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service.\\" The BLM stated on its website: > Cattle have been in trespass on public lands in southern Nevada for more > than two decades. This is unfair to the thousands of other ranchers who > graze livestock in compliance with federal laws and regulations throughout > the West. The Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service have > made repeated attempts to resolve this matter administratively and > judicially. An impoundment of cattle illegally grazing on public lands is > now being conducted as a last resort. A page on the BLM website, since removed, listed the impacts of Bundy's trespass cattle. Among these were risks to people driving on roadways, destruction of crops on private property, damage to community property in the city of Mesquite, negative impacts on city facilities in Bunkerville, destruction of archaeological artifacts and unauthorized reservoir construction. The regional off-site mitigation strategies of non-governmental organizations were also delayed for the Dry Lake Solar Energy Zone, and a matching $400,000 grant from the Walton Family Foundation to restore habitat for the southwest willow flycatcher along the Virgin River was delayed on the condition that Bundy remove the trespass cattle. = BLM preparations and execution = A closure of the public lands known as Gold Butte, Mormon Mesa, and Bunkerville Flats Areas was approved by the Department of the Interior on March 24, 2014 and was to be effective March 27 to May 12, 2014. Additionally, the Federal Register stated that: \\"This temporary closure is necessary to limit public access, use, and occupancy during an impoundment of illegally grazing cattle to ensure the safety and welfare of the public, contractors, and government employees.\\" The project area consisted of 802,571 acres, primarily composed of the Bunkerville Allotment (145,604 acres) and the New Trespass Lands (451,775 acres). Portions of the project area are managed under the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the National Park Service. Not all of the public areas would be closed at the same time if operations were moved to another location. No 30-day comment period or public scoping was conducted due to the confidential nature of law enforcement actions.  Involvement of state and local authorities; attempts to negotiate  Before the round-up, the Bureau of Land Management contacted state and local authorities. The bureau advised Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval and Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto of the agency's proposed actions. Clark County sheriff Doug Gillespie relayed information from the BLM and helped negotiate an end to the standoff. In 2012 and again during the 2014 roundup, the BLM had reportedly offered to buy Bundy's cattle and give him proceeds from their eventual sale. According to Cliven Bundy's son, Ammon Bundy, Gillespie also delivered an offer for the bureau to leave the area and keep the cattle.  First Amendment zones  The Bureau of Land Management designated two First Amendment zones \\"...for members of the public to express their First Amendment rights: Interstate 15 and Exit 112 for Riverside and State Route 170 and White Rock Road\\" with just one of the two First Amendment zones open at any one time at the daily discretion of the \\"Incident Command staff.\\" A third area, Interstate 15 and Toquap Wash (between mile marker 114 and 115), was designated as a media area and \\"...BLM/NPS credentialed media...\\" could request tours by appointment inside the enclosure area to obtain b-roll video, no live feed and satellite trucks allowed.Notice of Temporary Closure on Public Lands in the Gold Butte, Mormon Mesa, and Bunkerville Flats Areas in the Northeastern Portion of Clark County, NV, (March 27, 2014).  Roundup yield  Government contractors using horses and a small helicopter succeeded in penning almost 400 trespass cattle from April 5 to 9, 2014. \\"According to state brand inspectors, almost 90 percent of the cattle rounded up by midweek bore Bundy's brand. Of the remaining animals, five belonged to a neighboring rancher, four were marked with brands that couldn't be read, and the rest were slicks, a ranching term for unmarked livestock.\\" Six animals died, four were euthanized. One, a bull \\"posed a significant threat,\\" while another ran into a fence, injuring its spine. The circumstances for the other two were not explained. A state brand inspector said the bull \\"might have got frightened, but that's no reason to shoot a bull.\\" Another said that bulls sometimes charge at people, adding that it takes \\"a pretty good-size weapon\\" to kill Bundy's breed of bull. After the roundup was suspended because of safety concerns, BLM spokesman Craig Leff said the agency would try to resolve the matter \\"administratively and judicially.\\" Leff said: \\"The door isn't closed. We'll figure out how to move forward with this.\\" He added: \\"The BLM and National Park Service did not cut any deal and negotiate anything.\\"  Confrontations and protests in April 2014  In late March, Bundy sent letters entitled \\"Range War Emergency Notice and Demand for Protection\\" to county, state, and federal officials. In media interviews, Bundy used the language of the sovereign citizen movement as a rallying call, beckoning support from members of the Oath Keepers, the White Mountain Militia, and the Praetorian Guard. At a March 27 meeting of the Bunkerville Town Advisory Board, Cliven Bundy's son, Ryan Bundy, spoke on state sovereignty and land-ownership matters: \\"This is an issue of state sovereignty ... These large tracts of land that Bureau of Land Management, Forest Service, monuments, parks and, you know, National Parks, et cetera, et cetera, there is no constitutionality to them at all.\\" He also described his family's position: > If they are going to be out in the hills stealing our property, we will put > measures of defense. And they have always asked us, \\"What will you do, what > will you do?\\" and our stance has always been we will do whatever it takes. > Open-ended. And because of that, that's why they are scared, because they > don't know to what level we will go to protect, but we will protect. In early April, armed people and private militia members from across the United States joined peaceful protesters against the trespass-cattle roundup in what has become known as the Battle of Bunkerville (evoking an association with the Battle of Bunker Hill). BLM enforcement agents were dispatched in response to what were seen as threatening statements by Bundy, such as calling the events a \\"range war\\". With many roads closed to ensure safety during the cattle removal, controversial designated First Amendment zones where protesters could safely congregate or exercise their First Amendment right to peaceably assemble were marked with signs and orange plastic fences adjacent to the road. On April 8, 2014, Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval issued a statement calling for the removal of the First Amendment restrictions he described as offensive. After stating that peaceful protests had crossed into illegal activity, the federal agencies allowed protesters to go anywhere on the public land as long as they were peaceful. = April 10 confrontations and protests = On April 10, protesters blocked a BLM truck and demanded to know why a backhoe and dump truck were being used in the operation. The BLM's director in Nevada later said that the equipment was being used for field restoration. According to a statement from the BLM, the blocked truck \\"was struck by a protester on an ATV\\" (all-terrain vehicle). Officers protecting the truck driver had Tasers and police dogs. The protesters angrily confronted the rangers. According to CNN, \\"Federal officials say a police dog was kicked and officers were assaulted. Bundy family members say they were thrown to the ground or jolted with a Taser.\\" = April 12 confrontations and suspension of roundup = On the morning of April 12, an armed crowd rallied under a banner that read \\"Liberty Freedom For God We Stand\\". Most had signs, many of which chided \\"government thugs\\". Addressing the protesters, Bundy said, \\"We definitely don't recognize [the BLM director's] jurisdiction or authority, his arresting power or policing power in any way\\" and \\"We're about ready to take the country over with force!\\" After the BLM announced a suspension of the roundup, Bundy suggested blocking a highway. Armed protesters blocked a portion of Interstate 15 for more than two hours, causing traffic backups for three miles in both directions. Protesters also converged at the mouth of Gold Butte, the preserve where the cattle were corralled, and a tense, hour-long standoff ensued. BLM rangers warned over loudspeakers that they were prepared to use tear gas. Former Arizona Sheriff Richard Mack, who was with the protesters, said that they were \\"strategizing to put all the women up at the front. If they are going to start shooting, it's going to be women that are going to be televised all across the world getting shot by these rogue federal officers\\". Protesters with rifles took positions on a highway overpass, offering cover as horse-mounted wranglers led protesters to face off against BLM rangers and snipers. Utah Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox, who officially traveled to the Bundy standoff to convey that Utah did not want the cattle, put the number of federal agents present at over 200. According to Las Vegas assistant sheriff Joe Lombardo, there were 24 BLM rangers and Las Vegas deputy sheriffs present at the standoff. Las Vegas police were not allowed to wear protective gear because of fear that it would be seen as a provocation. Clark County Sheriff Gillespie blames the escalation of the situation on the BLM, stating to the Las Vegas Review-Journal that the BLM has lied to him about having a place to take the cattle and the BLM did not attend town-hall meetings and disregarded his advice as County Sheriff. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that tensions reached a \\"critical level\\" during the standoff, \\"with rifles pointing toward each side.\\" Las Vegas station KLAS-TV also reported that guns were pointed at officers. Assistant Sheriff Lombardo recounted that \\"they were in my face yelling profanities and pointing weapons,\\" and said, \\"We were outgunned, outmanned, and there would not have been a good result from it.\\" A photojournalist for Reuters wrote that armed supporters had \\"taken up tactical positions on government officers,\\" and that one man pointing a rifle in the direction of BLM employees said, \\"I've got a clear shot at four of them.\\" Another man said, \\"I'm ready to pull the trigger if fired upon.\\" Las Vegas Metro Deputy Chief Tom Roberts defused the situation by announcing that Bundy's cattle would be returned within 30 minutes. The BLM announced that it would suspend the mass roundup, citing safety reasons. Clark County Sheriff Gillespie mediated the agreement between the Bundy family and the BLM, saying, \\"[W]hen a group of protesters threaten civil unrest or violence in this county -- it is my job to step in and ensure the safety of citizens.\\" BLM Director Neil Kornze said that \\"Based on information about conditions on the ground, and in consultation with law enforcement, we have made a decision to conclude the cattle gather because of our serious concern about the safety of employees and members of the public.\\" BLM spokesman Craig Leff stated on April 14 in an email that \\"The gather is over\\" but that the agency planned to seek a solution \\"administratively and judicially\\" and intended to pursue court action to collect more than $1 million in back grazing fees owed by Bundy. Las Vegas police stated that business owners in Mesquite had received threats because of the conflict. Militiamen were reportedly seen carrying rifles, keeping a round-the-clock security detail on Bundy, and setting up checkpoints. =Unmet demands to disarm federal agents and destroy entrance stations= After the BLM announced that it would release the gathered cattle, Bundy demanded that the county sheriff disarm the National Park Service \\"at Lake Mead and Red Rock park and all other parks where the federal government claims they have jurisdiction over.\\" He requested that the arms be delivered within one hour. Bundy further demanded that county bulldozers or loaders be used to \\"tear down that entrance places where they ticket us and where they injure us and make us citizens pay their fees.\\" The demands, which he described as a \\"mandate from we the people\\", were not met. Bundy made similar statements two days later when he appeared on Glenn Beck's radio show and the Fox News program Hannity. He reiterated the demands on Sean Hannity's program: \\"The demand on the sheriff was de-arm the Park Service rangers, and de-arm Red Rock rangers ‚Äî that's two parks very close to the Lake Mead area. And then the demand was, tear down the toll booth shacks.\\" After expressing disappointment that the demands had not been met, he requested to \\"every county sheriff across the United States\\" that they \\"disarm the federal bureaucrats.\\" Bundy is reported to have described these demands as \\"a revelation that I received.\\" According to Esquire, Bundy told a crowd, \\"The good Lord said, 'Bundy, it's not your job, it's their job.'...This morning, I said a prayer, and this is what I received. I heard a voice say, 'Sheriff Gillespie, your work is not done. Every sheriff across the United States, take the guns away from the United States bureaucrats.\\"  Events following April 2014 cattle gather  = BLM attempts to communicate with Bundy = After the roundup was suspended, Cliven Bundy received several certified letters from the BLM that he refused to open. A BLM spokesperson said that the letters included notices that \\"provide Mr. Bundy the opportunity to buy back the gathered cattle.\\" The spokesperson did not explain why the agency had sent Bundy notices regarding cattle that had been released to him. =Cliven Bundy statements and actions= Bundy alleged that the federal government wants to kill him for challenging its authority. During a press conference, he made controversial racial statements that were widely repudiated. On May 2, 2014, Bundy and his family filed a complaint with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department alleging crimes committed by federal agents, including illegally blocking roads, harassing photographers, using attack dogs, pointing weapons and threatening people. During a June 3, 2014, radio program Cliven Bundy spoke with a small group of candidates for Clark County sheriff. He did not endorse any candidate, but he said that he did not want a peacemaker in that position. \\"You gonna be a peacemaker,\\" said Bundy, \\"you're gonna be on the BLM's side.\\" =Continued presence of Bundy supporters= At a \\"Patriot Party\\" after the standoff, supporters were treated to music from Ron Keel, a singer who worked with Black Sabbath for a short while in 1984. In late April, Nevada Congressman Steven Horsford contacted Clark County sheriff Doug Gillespie regarding complaints from community members. The reported complaints alleged that Bundy militia supporters had established a persistent presence along roads, that they had set up checkpoints for citizens to prove residence, and that they had established an armed presence around churches, a school, and other community locations. One local resident said that neighbors on their way to an Easter Sunday church service were greeted by armed militia members, causing some of them not to enter \\"for fear and disgust of having their church basically held captive.\\" According to the Associated Press, Cliven Bundy acknowledged \\"creating a stir\\", saying that there may have been weapons in the parking lot, but there were none in the church. Las Vegas station KLAS-TV reported that armed protesters had blocked a county road and attempted to prevent a news crew from passing. The station also reported that \\"some poured lighter fluid around our news vehicle while others got physical.\\" Bundy says that armed guards screen visitors at his ranch, but says that militia have not set up checkpoints on public property. Mike Vanderboegh, a militia leader who remained in Nevada after the standoff, accused Senator Harry Reid of provoking a \\"civil war\\" and said not to \\"poke the wolverine with a sharp stick, Harry, unless you want your balls ripped off.\\" Vanderboegh is the author of a novel that allegedly inspired a domestic terror plot and the leader of the Three Percenters Group, which the Anti-Defamation League characterizes as \\"part of an anti-government extremist movement\\". Media outlets reported on conflict between different factions of Bundy supporters. A \\"wild, paranoid rumor\\" that Attorney General Eric Holder was preparing a drone strike against them caused Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes to remove his men from the supposed \\"kill zone\\". In a recorded video, other Bundy supporters talked openly of shooting Rhodes for what they viewed as \\"desertion\\" and \\"cowardice\\". Rhodes later described one situation as \\"this close from being a gunfight\\". He recounted another situation in which he said a man drew a gun on a member of another militia. Esquire has described an assortment of fringe beliefs held by individual Bundy supporters who remained at the ranch: That Barack Obama is \\"a Muslim Kenyan\\", that the BLM works for the United Nations, that people born in or after 1980 may be implanted with microchips, and that bar-certified lawyers have sworn allegiance to Britain and regularly have sex with clients. Militia members have attempted to crowdfund their continued stay at the Bundy ranch. The site GoFundMe took down campaigns by Blaine Cooper and Christopher E. Ferrell. According to Nevada representative Steven Horsford, only about 15 armed militia remained as of early June 2014. = FBI and U.S. Capitol Police investigations = On May 8, Clark County sheriff's officials said that they were interviewed by the FBI as part of an investigation into armed Bundy supporters who confronted federal officers during the standoff. The investigation was confirmed by Clark County Sheriff Doug Gillespie, who stated \\"I've said all along there has to be accountability for what took place on April 12.\\" Joe Lombardo, who was in charge of police officers at the scene and who was interviewed on May 1, said the FBI agents were primarily interested in who was pointing weapons at federal agents, and that he expected the FBI to be poring over videotapes and photos taken during the standoff in order to identify people making threats. After Senator Harry Reid criticized Bundy supporters, Politico reported that sources said the Senator had been the subject of threats and consequently had increased his security detail. A spokesman for the US Capitol Police, without commenting on the nature of any threats against Harry Reid, said, \\"We are currently looking into threatening statements made against Sen. Reid as part of an ongoing investigation.\\" = 2014 Las Vegas shootings = Two people who were briefly at the ranch during the standoff were later involved in a shootout in Las Vegas. Cliven Bundy said that the couple, Jerad and Amanda Miller, had been asked to leave the ranch after a few days because they were \\"very radical\\" and did not align themselves with the protest's main issues. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Jerad and Amanda Miller were two of \\"perhaps hundreds of thousands\\" who saw the outcome of the Bundy standoff as \\"a huge victory against the federal government,\\" which \\"may have pushed them over the edge.\\" This shooting occurred on June 8, 2014, when Jerad and Amanda Miller killed two Las Vegas police officers and an armed civilian before Amanda Miller took her life. Jerad Miller was fatally wounded and died during a shootout with police. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell reacted to the shootings, saying, \\"It's very important to bring lawbreakers to justice. ... [Bundy] put our people in grave danger by calling in armed civilians from around the country, and that's not okay.\\" Carol Bundy said, \\"I have not seen or heard anything from the militia and others who have came to our ranch that would, in any way, make me think they had an intent to kill or harm anyone.\\" = 2016 Burns, Oregon standoff = In January 2016, armed men led by Ryan and Ammon Bundy seized control of the headquarters of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge near Burns, Oregon. The occupation ended 40 days later on February 11, when the final occupier willingly went into custody. On February 10, 2016, Cliven Bundy posted to his Facebook page that he was on his way to the refuge, in part saying \\"Wake up patriots! Wake up militia! It's time!!!!\\" He was arrested a few hours later at Portland International Airport. On December 1, 2019, an investigation commissioned by the Washington House of Representatives reported Washington state legislator, white supremacist Matt Shea had planned and participated in domestic terrorism on at least three occasions.From Ruby Ridge to Matt Shea, eastern Washington struggles to shake far-right extremism, Los Angeles Times, December 20, 2019.

This included his participation, organizing, planning, and promotion of the 2014 standoff in Nevada, the 2015 armed conflict in Priest River, Idaho, and the 2016 armed seizure of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge by a group led by the Bundys. Shea led a delegation of right-wing legislators from Oregon, Washington and Idaho that met with law enforcement on January 9, 2016, in Burns, Oregon where they were appraised of confidential intended law enforcement strategies for dealing with the refuge occupiers.Ore. state legislator meets with armed group at wildlife refuge, KGW, January 11, 2016. Retrieved December 24, 2019. Shea then disclosed those details to the Bundys, according to the report.  Aftermath  =Reactions by public officials= Senators Republican Senator Dean Heller of Nevada said of the Bundy supporters, \\"These people are patriots.\\" Heller made that statement during the same television interview in which Senator Harry Reid described the Bundy supporters as \\"domestic terrorists.\\" Heller also complained of federal actions during the standoff, saying, \\"I told him [BLM Director Neil Kornze] very clearly that law-abiding Nevadans must not be penalized by an over- reaching BLM\\". After the resolution he stated, \\"emotions and tensions are still near the boiling point.\\" Later on he said that Bundy should pay the BLM the more than $1 million in grazing fees owed to the agency. After the BLM left the area for safety concerns, Nevada's senior U.S. Senator and then Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said, \\"Well, it's not over. We can't have an American people that violate the law and then just walk away from it. So it's not over.\\" Reid also referred to the militia supporting Bundy as \\"domestic terrorists\\". Congressional representatives Republican Representative Chris Stewart (R-Utah) decried the BLM and other agencies for staffing their departments with what he called \\"paramilitary units\\" and \\"SWAT team[s]\\". However, the BLM does not have a SWAT team, according to The Salt Lake Tribune, which editorialized that Stewart's views \\"may be one of the worst ideas in the history of bad ideas.\\"Editorial: Stewart misses the point on BLM cops, The Salt Lake Tribune, May 1, 2014 In response, a BLM agency's spokeswoman said that the BLM doesn't have any SWAT or tactical teams. An Interior Department representative said that the BLM \\"had law enforcement personnel present to provide safety for their employees and the public\\". On April 19, 2014, Texas Republican Steve Stockman sent a letter to President Barack Obama, Department of the Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, and BLM Director Neil Kornze, stating that the BLM was overreaching its law enforcement authority with what he called a \\"paramilitary raid.\\" In a July 20, 2014 column in The Washington Post titled \\"Nevada: Burned by the Rants of Hotheads'\\", then-Representative Steven Horsford (D-Nevada) described recent incidents of violence in his district and nearby states, and criticized the \\"nonstop attention and demagoguery from media and politicians alike,\\" saying: \\"There can be reasonable disagreements about the Bundy Ranch. But we can disagree without offering refuge to dangerous individuals on the fringe.\\" Nevada governor and state lawmakers Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval sided with Bundy, saying, \\"No cow justifies the atmosphere of intimidation which currently exists nor the limitation of constitutional rights that are sacred to all Nevadans. The BLM needs to reconsider its approach to this matter and act accordingly.\\" Nevada Assemblywoman Michele Fiore, who supported Bundy, aiding him with his returned calves, said, \\"It's time for Nevada to stand up to the federal government and demand the return of the BLM lands to the people of Nevada.\\" Arizona lawmakers On April 15, 2014, a group of Republican state legislators from Arizona, including Representatives Bob Thorpe (R-Flagstaff), David Livingston (R-Peoria), Kelly Townsend (R-Mesa), Senators Judy Burges (R-Sun City West), and Kelli Ward (R-Lake Havasu City) traveled to Mesquite, Nevada, to support Bundy in his standoff with the BLM.Republican Legislators Caravan To The Bundy Ranch, Tucson Weekly, David Safier, April 16, 2014. Retrieved December 24, 2019. Arizona Representative Kelly Townsend said that the scenes at the ranch amid the dispute gave her a \\"visceral reaction ... It sounds dramatic, but it reminded me of Tiananmen Square. I don't recognize my country at this point.\\" Her colleague, Bob Thorpe of Flagstaff, said that he was one of about three dozen state legislators who had sent a letter about the standoff to Nevada and federal officials. Congressman Paul Gosar also joined the group. =Reactions from media= Media personalities have weighed in on the confrontations. During the standoff, Bundy was interviewed (via remote link) by television host Sean Hannity. Hannity stated that some fear events could wind up mirroring the Waco siege and Ruby Ridge and said, \\"This is public land, and it's not being used, in my mind, and I'm not a rancher, (but) I would think the federal government might be thankful because you're cutting the lawn for free, and they're charging huge amounts of money, right, to let your cattle graze there with these fees\\". In contrast, a comparison of BLM grazing fees with private land market prices demonstrated the Bundy's are getting a 93% discount by grazing on BLM land. Joy Reid an others mocked Cliven Bundy calling him a welfare cowboy as a derogatory term inspired by Welfare queen. Editorial responses from newspapers have been mixed. The Las Vegas Review-Journal wrote that the BLM was right to defuse the situation, but that the confrontation showed the problems of federal land ownership in the state and called for the federal government to sell off the land in question.Editorial: BLMs cattle battle ends ‚Äî for now, Las Vegas Review-Journal, April 16, 2014 The Las Vegas Sun wrote that \\"Bundy hit a trifecta of sorts: He violated the laws Congress made, ignored the judicial branch's orders, and defied the executive branch's efforts to enforce those laws and orders ... In the end, Bundy isn't the victor; anarchy is. The rule of law, and society as a whole, lost.\\" The Casper Star-Tribune wrote that Bundy was cheating taxpayers, an \\"embarrassment to ranchers in Wyoming and across the West who work hard, pay their taxes and maintain good relationships with managers of federal land on which their cattle graze.\\"Editorial board: Dismiss Cliven Bundy for what he is -- a guy trying to dodge a bill, Casper Star-Tribune, April 28, 2014 In response to Bundy supporter Mike Vanderboegh's comment, \\"Don't poke the wolverine with a sharp stick, Harry [Reid], unless you want your balls ripped off\\", a writer for The Nation framed the remark as part of a larger, right-wing obsession with castration. Gawker lampooned militia crowdfunding attempts as a \\"welfare drive\\" to \\"sit around doing nothing\\". =Reactions by Bundy and supporters= About 1,500 Bundy supporters attended a celebration on April 18, where they ate Bundy beef, read cowboy poetry, and wore \\"domestic terrorist\\" name tags, referencing a comment made by Nevada Senator Harry Reid. Bundy said he would continue holding a daily news conference. Some Tea Party Movement supporters expressed solidarity with the Bundys, including three Southern Nevada Tea Party groups that organized a protest outside Las Vegas police headquarters on April 11, 2014, claiming that Sheriff Doug Gillespie had failed in his duty to protect Nevadans from abuse by the federal government. The Bundy family claimed victory on having its cattle returned.Dobson, Jennifer (April 13, 2014). \\"Nevada ranching family claims victory as government releases cattle\\". Yahoo! News In an interview after the BLM's withdrawal, Sean Hannity asked Bundy if he had a reply to Senator Harry Reid's comment that the situation was not over. Bundy said, \\"I don't have a response for Harry Reid, but I have a response for every county sheriff across the United States. Disarm the federal bureaucrats.\\" An Oklahoma militia with members present in Nevada stated their support for Cliven Bundy. During an appearance on The O'Reilly Factor, host Bill O'Reilly asked Scott Shaw, a co-founder of the Oklahoma Volunteer Militia, what made Cliven Bundy different from Occupy Wall Street supporters. Shaw replied that Cliven Bundy is \\"providing the country with beef\\" and that the two groups have different methods of dissent. In Texas, Michael Joseph Kearns, a convicted felon with alleged ties to the sovereign citizen movement who describes himself as a \\"self-taught paralegal\\", filed a motion seeking to overturn a 2013 ruling allowing the BLM to seize Bundy's cattle. After the judge ruled that Kearns had no standing, Kearns filed another motion. He wrote that the judge's \\"orders, judgments and mandates, have no rightful or lawful force and effect upon the people of the United States.\\" Describing Kearns as an \\"abusive filer\\", the judge directed the federal clerk to return, \\"without docketing,\\" any future documents Kearns tries to file. Kearns, who has denied that he is part of the sovereign citizen movement, was convicted in 1996 of one count conspiracy to defraud the United States and seven counts of aiding and abetting mail fraud.Judgment and Commitment, May 10, 1996, entered May 16, 1996, United States v.

But I don't recognize the United States government as even existing,\\" is at odds with Nevada's law, specifically the state's constitution. Framed during the Civil War, Nevada's constitution specifically mentions the rights of the federal government, stating in Article 1, Section 2, > \\"The Paramount Allegiance of every citizen is due to the Federal Government > in the exercise of all its Constitutional powers as the same have been or > may be defined by the Supreme Court of the United States ... whensoever any > portion of the States, or people thereof attempt to secede from the Federal > Union, or forcibly resist the Execution of its laws, the Federal Government > may, by warrant of the Constitution, employ armed force in compelling > obedience to its Authority.\\" The Salt Lake City Tribune published an editorial on April 15 entitled \\"Bundy is a lawbreaker, not a hero\\", in which it said, \\"Don't let him get away with it\\" and \\"The only winner in this was a scofflaw who has twice lost in the courts for running cattle where they don't belong and skipping out on grazing fees. Some 20,000 ranchers in Western states abide by BLM regulations, so what makes Bundy special?\\" To sum it up, the Tribune said, \\"When some manage to avoid justice by extralegal means, the rule of law is weakened for all Americans.\\" Dallas Hyland, in his column in Utah's St. George News, wrote, \\"The stand-down was necessary to prevent bloodshed, but it must be recognized that if Bundy and a multitude of his supporters, militia friends, and even family members who broke the law, are allowed to go unpunished, anarchy will follow. In the case of Bundy and the Gold Butte designations, the government did it right. They continued to do it right in the face of the lawless behavior of a rancher and his militia henchmen.\\" =Reactions related to American Indian history= Indian Country Today Media Network wrote that government treatment of Cliven Bundy \\"stands in stark contrast to what was done to the Dann sisters and other Indigenous Peoples on Shoshone territory\\" and that \\"United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination found \\"credible information alleging that the Western Shoshone indigenous people are being denied their traditional rights to land.\\" An editorial in the Las Vegas Review-Journal also contrasted Bundy's dispute with that of the Dann Sisters. A Las Vegas news outlet reported that the Moapa band of Paiute Indians had provided them with a map indicating that a federal treaty had promised them the land on which the Bundy ranch is situated.\\" =Political commentary reactions= David Damore, a political science professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said that there is \\"a great ability on the part of these folks to overlook the reality of how much the federal government subsidized Nevada in terms of big projects ‚Äì the Hoover Dam, the mining subsidies. It's a welfare cowboy mindset.\\" Elaine Hurd, a resident of nearby Mesquite Nevada, told local television station KLAS \\"I feel that the rule of law supersedes armed militias coming in from all over the country to stand with a law-breaking rancher, which is what he is.\\" Brad Knickerbocker of the Christian Science Monitor saw the events as echoing the Sagebrush Rebellion, a 1970s movement to transfer control of public domain lands to the states. =Environmentalist reactions= The nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity stated, \\"Despite having no legal right to do so, cattle from Bundy's ranch have continued to graze throughout the Gold Butte area, competing with tortoises for food, hindering the ability of plants to recover from extensive wildfires, trampling rare plants, damaging ancient American Indian cultural sites and threatening the safety of recreationists.\\" Rob Mrowka, also with the Center for Biological Diversity, said that the BLM \\"is allowing a freeloading rancher and armed thugs to seize hundreds of thousands of acres of the people's land as their own. It's backing down in the face of threats and posturing of armed sovereignists.\\" Environmentalists held that the BLM's withdrawal sent the wrong message to law-abiding ranchers who do secure grazing permits and operate within the law. =Aftermath from Bureau of Land Management= Twenty months after the incident, Bundy had not paid the fees and continued to graze cattle on Federal land. A spokesperson for the Bureau of Land Management wrote in response to a reporter's inquiry: \\"Our primary goal remains to resolve this matter safely and according to the rule of the law.\\" The response added \\"The Bureau of Land Management remains resolute in addressing issues involved in efforts to gather Mr. Bundy's cattle and we are pursuing the matter through the legal system.\\" The BLM spokesperson also said \\"The Department of Justice has the lead on any investigation of federal crimes that may have been committed.\\" The US Attorney's Office in Las Vegas would neither confirm or deny that there was a criminal investigation. Roger Taylor, a retired BLM district manager in Arizona, said the agency's decision to release the cattle would have repercussions. \\"The (agency) is going to be in a worse situation where they will have a much more difficult time getting those cattle off the land and getting Bundy in compliance with regulations,\\" he said.  2016 standoff  On February 10, 2016, Cliven Bundy traveled to Portland, Oregon, in response to federal law enforcement moving to end a standoff led by his sons Ammon and Ryan at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. He was arrested at the airport by the FBI and was incarcerated at the Multnomah County Jail. He was indicted for 16 federal felonies on February 17, along with Ammon and Ryan Bundy, militia leader Ryan Payne, and broadcaster Peter Santilli, who were already under arrest for their role in the Malheur standoff. Another 14 individuals were charged on March 3, 2016. Santilli subsequently pled guilty to felony conspiracy to injure or impede a federal officer.Defendant In Bundy Case Pleads Guilty To Conspiracy . KXNT, 6 October 2017 On January 8, 2018, U.S. District Judge Gloria Navarro in Las Vegas dismissed with prejudice the criminal charges against Cliven Bundy, his sons Ammon and Ryan, and co-defendant Ryan Payne regarding the standoff.  Prosecutions of some standoff participants  The first criminal case resulting from the standoff, against six Bundy supporters, was declared a mistrial by U.S. District Judge Gloria Navarro on April 24, 2017. Six men had been charged with conspiring with Cliven Bundy to prevent a court-ordered cattle seizure. The mistrial was declared hours after the jury convicted two men of some of the 10 counts in the indictment. The jurors reported to the court they were \\"hopelessly deadlocked\\" on the remaining counts and defendants, despite the judge having sent them back to deliberate further but they were unable to reach any unanimous verdicts for four defendants, described by prosecutors as the \\"least culpable\\" of the 17 who were charged, and on the remaining counts for the two who were convicted. Over 50 prosecution witnesses testified in the two-month trial. Former militia group member, Gregory Burleson, of Arizona, who has also been a paid FBI informant, was convicted of assault upon and threatening of a federal officer, aiding extortion via both interstate commerce and travel, obstruction of justice, plus multiple gun counts.

Most of the region now lies within Kotor Municipality. It is a fertile region defined by the Lovƒáen to the east, and terminating at the low western hills overlooking the Adriatic sea to its west. Etymology Grbalj was derived from Gripuli or Grupuli, a derivation of Acruvium, the ancient Roman city located in this vicinity (considered most likely at present-day Kotor). Geography The east side of the field, collectively referred to as Upper Grbalj, encompasses ten settlements. Lower Grbalj consists of all settlements at the western edge of the field. Bigova, located within a cove of the same name, is the only settlement situated on the coast. Upper and Lower Grbalj are divided by two creeks. To the south, Kovaƒçki Potok (\\"creek\\") drains along the alluvial plain of Mrƒçevo Field into Jaz Bay at the west end of Jaz Beach. Grbalj's named settlements include Bigova, Brate≈°iƒái, Vi≈°njeva, Vranoviƒái, Glavati, Glavatiƒçiƒái, Goroviƒái, Dub, Zagora, Kovaƒçi, Krimovica, Kubasi, Lje≈°eviƒái, Nalje≈æiƒái, Pelinovo, Pobrƒëe, Prijeradi, Sutvara, Tre≈°njica, Ukropci, ≈†i≈°iƒái and Maƒçiƒá. The Adriatic Highway goes through Grbalj. After its construction, and the subsequent 1979 earthquake, several new settlements were established along its route. Economy The region is an important agricultural area. The southern part of the field consists of orchards, vineyards and vegetable gardens. This part of the field ends with the Jaz beach. The industrial area of Kotor lies at the northern part of the Grbalj field. History =Middle Ages= Medieval region. Grbalj had been a ≈æupa (county) of the medieval Serbian state of Duklja, and subsequently part of the Grand Principality of Serbia (1091‚Äì1217), the medieval Kingdom of Serbia (1217‚Äì1346), and the Serbian Empire (1346‚Äì1371) until its fall. It was also the personal estate of Stefan Vukanoviƒá Nemanjiƒá (fl. 1252). Most of Grbalj became part of the Principality of Zeta (1371-1378). Grbalj was part of the Serbian Despotate from 1421-1439. The regional, 1427 Code of Grbalj was issued at the ≈æupa's Podlastva Monastery. During a transitional period of government, a peasant rebellion erupted in Grbalj (Zeta coast) against Kotor regarding the effects of control by Venice (1451-1452). As part of his efforts to align himself with Venice, Stefanica Crnojeviƒá suppressed the rebellion, devastating the region. In 1497 Firuz Beg captured Grbalj and put Zeta under his effective military control, although it was still part of the Principality of Zeta governed by Stefan II Crnojeviƒá. Grbalj eventually became part of what was known as Venetian Albania. =Ottoman period= The Ottoman census of 1582‚Äì83 registered the \\"vilayet of the Black Mountain\\" (vilayet-i Kara Daƒü), part of the Sanjak of Scutari, as having the following nahiyah, with number of villages: Grbavci with 13 villages, ≈Ωupa with 11, Malon≈°iƒái with 7, Pje≈°ivci with 14, Cetinje with 16, Rijeka with 31, Crmnica with 11, Pa≈°troviƒái with 36 and Grbalj with 9 villages; a total of 148 villages. =Contemporary history= In 1869, Ivo and Jovan Rafailoviƒá led a Grbalj uprising against Austria. Grbalj had been an op≈°tina, (\\"municipality\\") in post-WWI Yugoslavia. In 1970, football club OFK Grbalj was founded in Kotor Municipality. Culture Grbaljski knez i knjeginja, iz 1804. godine (po ilustracijama iz putopisne knjige Wiliama Millera) The Serbian Orthodox Podlastva Monastery lies in Grbalj. People from Grbalj are known by the demonym Grbljani and are often perceived as a clan. Overall, in Montenegro, the Nemanjiƒá cult was more widespread than that of Prince Lazar's, though in Grbalj, the latter cult became particularly popular, with the locals claiming Lazar as a native.

Biography Bezobrazov was born to a well-connected noble family. He joined the Imperial Russian Army, attaining the rank of captain in the Horse Guards. After the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881, he became a member of a secret counter-revolutionary organization known as the ‚ÄúHoly Militia‚Äù. In 1896, Bezobrazov submitted a petition to the throne, in which he predicted the inevitability of war with the Empire of Japan and urging an aggressive policy against Japan in Korea and Manchuria. His proposal involved the establishment of a commercial enterprise reminiscent of the British East India Company, which would provide the government with tangible financial benefits while setting the stage for the peaceful conquest of the region. Although the proposal met with sympathy at Court, Bezobrazov was initially thwarted by Finance Minister Sergei Witte, who suspected Bezobrazov‚Äôs political intentions. However, in 1896, King Kojong of Korea was persuaded by Jules BrinerYul Brynner's grandfather., a Russian merchant based in Vladivostok to grant a timber concession along the Yalu River border between Korea and Manchuria. Briner offered to sell the concession to the Russian government in 1897. In 1898, Bezobrazov was introduced in person to Tsar Nicholas II by Grand Duke Aleksandr Mikhailovich Romanov, along with Bezobrazov‚Äôs cousin, Rear Admiral Alexey Abaza. This formed the core of what was later called the ‚ÄúBezobazov Circle‚Äù, along with Dowager Tsarina Maria Feodorovna, Prince Felix Yusupov, Mikhail Rodzianko, Admiral Yevgeni Ivanovich Alekseyev, and others. Bezobrazov convinced Tsar Nicholas II of his plans, and the imperial cabinet approved the purchase over Witte‚Äôs objections in May 1898. To avoid complications with foreign powers, the concession was chartered as a private company in July 1901, and it was suggested that shares might be offered to Germany and France (although not to Japan or Great Britain). In the interim, the Boxer Rebellion had resulted in a tremendous increase in Russian military influence in the area, and Russia was able to obtain similar concessions from China on the Manchurian side of the Yalu River. After the signing of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, Tsar Nicholas dispatched Bezobrazov to the region in person, where he alarmed Admiral Alekseyev with talk of war with Japan, and the need to stop the withdrawal of Russian troops from Manchuria. In 1902, with Witte out of favor at court, Bezobrazov was given almost unlimited access to state funds and was allowed to set up a private company called the Yalu River Timber Concessions. Although the company ostensibly was private, Bezobrazov was appointed a state secretary. Russian army units, dressed as civilians, established several military strongholds along the Yalu River, including some on the Korean side of the river. Bezobrazov also armed local Honghuzi bandits to drive out Chinese settlers in the region. From May 1903, Bezobrazov‚Äôs influence continued to increase, as the Tsar, after appointing Alekseyev as viceroy of the Far East, instructed him to discuss economic policy with Bezobrazov rather than Witte. Bezobrazov also returned to Manchuria to organize the Russian Timber Producing Association of the Far East. This Association was merged with Witte‚Äôs Manchurian Mining Association in August 1903. However, the actual outbreak of conflict between Japan and Russia in February 1904 caused the collapse of Bezobrazov‚Äôs enterprises, which were already financially overextended. He fled his creditors to Switzerland, but returned to Russia in late 1904. He left Russia again after the October Revolution and died in exile in Paris in 1931.

Built to withstand a nuclear attack, the former military structure is today used as a farmers' market, film studio, and venue for Toronto Roller Derby. History In 1952, the Canadian federal government acquired an airfield and several buildings located in the then North York neighbourhood of Downsview. A de Havilland Canada aircraft production facility was already located on the property, and the site would eventually become Canadian Forces Base Downsview. Several new structures were erected, including a large building which would be used for storage and shipping. Completed in 1954, the building consisted of a one-story warehouse with an adjoining two- story office building. de Havilland referred to the building as \\"Building 151\\" in accordance with a numbering system used by the company, and the Department of National Defence adopted this and officially named the structure \\"Building 151\\". The Treasury Board of Canada later referred to the building as \\"Supply Depot #1\\", and it was commonly called the \\"Supply Depot\\". The Supply Depot's location was well-suited for shipping and receiving, with a Canadian National Railway mainline located along the building's east side, connected to the north side of the Supply Depot by a spur-line. The recently-constructed Ontario Highway 401 was a short distance south. The building became the central supply location for the Canadian military, and contained small items such as screws and nails, as well as larger inventory like aircraft engines and wings. The warehouse portion of the Supply Depot was so expansive that workers moved from station to station using bicycles. When CFB Downsview closed in 1996, a portion of the former base--including the Supply Depot-- became part of Downsview Park, the first national urban park in Canada. In 1998, the Supply Depot became one of 11 properties at the site listed on a municipal heritage inventory. Design The Supply Depot is a unique example of Cold War military construction in Canada, with heavily reinforced concrete used to create a fortress-like structure designed to survive a nuclear blast. The walls are thick, and the flat roof is a thick slab of exposed concrete supported by columns spaced apart. In the Supply Depot's basement are two deep, water reservoirs used to supply the fire sprinkler system, and the roof was designed to store up to of water as a backup supply. On the building's south side is a door leading to a \\"Decontamination Centre\\", where individuals could enter the Supply Depot following a nuclear attack. The heavily- reinforced building also contained a bomb shelter. An architectural review from 2009 wrote, \\"the building was constructed during the period of Cold War and reflects the uncertain mood of the time with its tough envelope and back- up systems\\". Today The Supply Depot is used as a farmer's market and movie studio. Doors Open Toronto tours have also been conducted there. Since mid-2011, Toronto Roller Derby has played its home games in the south end of the building, known as The Bunker, including hosting the inaugural Roller Derby World Cup in 2011.

In 1913 Anstey's thesis, 'The Romance of Bible Chronology' was published, explaining how subtle pieces of information within the Bible text resolve these apparent chronological gaps.http://www.preteristarchive.com/Books/1913_anstey_romance.html He was the brother of John Anstey and also a keen 'Anstey' genealogist, mapping many of the early branches of the Devon Ansteys.  The Romance of Bible Chronology  Anstey identified five apparent chronological gaps within the Bible text, that had been attempted to be resolved with varying degrees of success by previous Bible chronologers. The five apparent chronological gaps that Anstey identified were: 1\\\\. The Noah-Shem connection, which determines the exact age of Noah at the birth of Shem, (which Anstey calculated to be 502 years). 2\\\\. The Terah-Abraham connection, which determines the exact age of Terah at the birth of Abraham, (which Anstey calculated to be 130 years). 3\\\\. The Joseph- Moses connection, which determines the exact number of years which elapsed between the death of Joseph, with which the Chronology of the book of Genesis ends (Gen. 50:26), and the birth of Moses, with which the Chronology of the book of Exodus begins (Exodus 7:7), (which Anstey calculated to be 64 years). 4\\\\. The Joshua-Judges connection, which determines the number of years that elapsed during the administration of Joshua and the Elders that survived him, between the division of the land at the end of the Seven Years' War of Conquest, with which the Chronology of the Book of Joshua ends (Joshua 14:7,10 with Numbers 10:11,12; 13:17,20), and the oppression of Cushan-Rishathaim of Mesopotamia, with which the Chronology of the Book of Judges begins (Judges 3:8), (which Anstey calculated to be 13 years). 5\\\\. The Eli-Saul connection, which determines the number of years that elapsed between the death of Eli and the beginning of the reign of Saul, (which Anstey calculated to be 20 years). This is given in the summary of I Samuel 7:2.  Contribution to biblical literalism  Having resolved the apparent chronological gaps in the Bible text, Anstey was able to argue that the Bible provided a coherent yet select historical record of human civilization. Anstey's thesis also critiqued other chronological records for their chronological errors compared to the Bible text. While archaeological discoveries during the twentieth and twenty-first century have in some instances dated the arguments and data presented in Anstey's thesis, his original chronological calculations and observations remain accurate.

During her time in the Near East Relief (now Near East Foundation), Nellie Miller Mann was instrumental in caring for hundreds of Armenian refugees who had survived the Armenian Genocide. During her time working with the refugees, Miller Mann wrote and photographed much of what she experienced. Her writings and photographs have been recently been published in a book entitled, Letters from Syria 1921-1923. Early life Nellie Miller Mann was born to parents Abram Rohrer and Selena Bell (Wade) Miller in Elkhart, Indiana on March 27, 1897. During her early life, she became a member of the Mennonite Church. Mann then went to Goshen, Indiana where she attended Goshen College. She studied there from 1918 to 1921. While studying there, she had overheard of the situation regarding the Armenians in the Ottoman Empire. Having been motivated to help, Orie Miller, the leader of the Mennonite Relief Commission, which later became known as Mennonite Central Committee, arranged for a number of Mennonite young men to go to Russia, Turkey and Syria under the Near East Relief Foundation to assist the refugees and orphans. After joining the Near East Relief, she immediately set sail to Syria where she was to assist Armenian refugees who have been deported outside of the Ottoman Empire as a result of the Armenian Genocide. Near East Relief Nellie Miller Mann with a child at the Bird's Nest orphanage in Beirut It was decided by the committee that Miller-Mann was to be shipped to Beirut where she was to serve as secretary to Ray Bender, the treasurer of the Near East Relief in the Beirut headquarters. She left from the New York City harbor on August 20, 1921 on the S.S. Patria, a French ocean liner, taking four weeks for her to cross the ocean, change ships, and stop at numerous ports in Italy, Greece, Egypt and Palestine, before arriving in Beirut on September 20, 1921. Earlier, in January 1920, as the Turkish War of Independence took hold, Mustafa Kemal advanced his troops into Marash where the Battle of Marash ensued against the French Armenian Legion. The battle resulted in a Turkish victory alongside the massacres of 5,000 ‚Äì 12,000 Armenians spelling the end of the remaining Armenian population in the region.Kerr. The Lions of Marash, p. 196. Upon her arrival in Beirut, she noted that in addition to the Armenian refugees who escaped in 1915, there was continuous influx of refugees as a result of the circumstances for the Armenians in Cilicia. She described the situation as follows: The Bird's Nest Orphanage with hundreds of children gathered in front. Miller-Mann provided relief to many of the children in this orphanage. While in Beirut, Miller-Mann went beyond her duties as a secretary and assisted as many orphans as possible in the surrounding area. The orphans by this time had reached an estimated 130,000. Throughout this period, Mann kept a diary where she wrote extensively about the plight of the orphans and her service to various orphanages. She notes that when many of the orphaned children arrived in Syria, they were placed in one of the 18 or 20 orphanages in the vicinity, where they were fed, clothed, given medical care and given a vocational education. Miller-Mann first worked with the orphanage of Antilyas, which, as she noted in a December 6, 1921 entry of her diary, was filled with Armenian orphaned girls: Nellie Miller-Mann was instrumental in helping prominent Danish missionary Maria Jacobsen with her orphanage called \\"The Bird's Nest\\". In January 1922, Jacobsen transferred many orphans to Beirut. After moving to Zouk Michail in July 1922, she established an orphanage which sheltered 208 Armenian children from Cilicia. Through the efforts of the Danish missionary, an Armenian orphanage that had previously been owned by the Near East Relief was acquired by The Women‚Äôs Missionary Workers (K.M.A.) in 1928. The orphanage, which was located in Byblos, became known as the \\"Bird's Nest\\" and was to eventually help 400 orphaned children who were aged from infants to up to nine years old. In January 1922, while Jacobsen was occupied transferring the orphans to Beirut, Miller-Mann visited the orphanage when it was under Near East Relief supervision. At the time of her initial visit, she noted that there were 600 Armenian orphans stationed at the orphanage and that they arrived about a year ago from Marash (now Kahramanmaras) and Aintab (now Gaziantep). While in the Middle-East, Miller-Mann toured the region and visited several sites including Baalbeck, Damascus, and Aleppo. Miller-Mann continued assisting the orphaned refugees until retired from her tours of duty in 1923. Later life Nellie Miller married to Cleo Mann on August 25, 1924. She eventually taught at a local Sunday school. Cleo and Nellie Mann moved to Indianapolis where they were instrumental in the founding of the first Mennonite church in the city. She died on February 2, 1997 at the age of 99 in Goshen, Indiana. Legacy Upon her return to the United States, Nellie Miller Mann was awarded the Near East Relief Service medal by the national field director of the Near East Foundation for her significant contributions to the Foundation and the relief effort. Her writings and photographs have been recently published in a 226 page book entitled Letters from Syria 1921-1923: A Response to the Armenian Tragedy, Including Stories, Travel and Reports.

It is most often used in women who have vaginal aplasia (the congential absence of a vagina). Background Vaginal aplasia is a rare medical condition in which the vagina does not form properly before birth. Sufferers of the condition may have a partially formed vagina, or none at all. The condition is typically treated by reconstructive surgery. First a space is surgically created where the vagina would typically exist. Then tissue from another part of the body is harvested, molded into the shape of a vagina, and grafted into the vagina cavity. This technique has significant drawbacks. Typically, the implanted tissue does not function normally as a muscle, which can lead to low enjoyment of sexual intercourse. Additionally, stenosis (narrowing of the cavity) can occur over time. Most women require multiple surgeries before a satisfactory result is achieved. An alternative to traditional reconstructive surgery is transplantation. Donor technique In a handful of cases, a woman with vaginal aplasia has received a successful vagina transplant donated by her mother. The first such case is believed to have occurred in 1970, with no signs of rejection taking place after three years. In at least one case, a woman who received such a transplant was able to conceive and give birth. In 1981, a 12-year-old girl with vaginal aplasia received a vaginal wall implant from her mother. She became sexually active seven years later, without incident. At age 24, she conceived and carried a child to term. The child was born via cesarean section. Laboratory-grown technique In April 2014, a team of scientists led by Anthony Atala reported that they had successfully transplanted laboratory-grown vaginas into four female teenaged girls with a rare medical condition called Mayer-Rokitansky-K√ºster-Hauser syndrome that causes the vagina to develop improperly, or sometimes not at all. Between 1 of 1,500 to 4,000 females are born with this condition. The four patients began treatment between May 2005 and August 2008. In each case, the medical research team began by taking a small sample of genital tissue from the teenager's vulva. The sample was used as a seed to grow additional tissue in the lab which was then placed in a vaginal shaped, biodegradable mold. Vaginal-lining cells were placed on the inside of the tube, while muscle cells were attached to the outside. Five to six weeks later, the structure was implanted into the patients, where the tissue continued to grow and connected with the girls' circulatory and other bodily systems. After about eight years, all four patients reported normal function and pleasure levels during sexual intercourse according to the Female Sexual Function Index questionnaire, a validated self-report tool. No adverse results or complications were reported. In two of the four women, the vagina was attached to the uterus, making pregnancy possible. No pregnancies were reported, however, during the study period. Martin Birchall, who works on tissue engineering, but was not involved in the study, said it \\"addressed some of the most important questions facing translation of tissue engineering technologies.\\" Commentary published by the National Health Service (NHS) called the study \\"an important proof of concept\\" and said it showed that tissue engineering had \\"a great deal of potential.\\" However, the NHS also cautioned that the sample size was very small and further research was necessary to determine the general viability of the technique. The laboratory-grown autologous transplant technique could also be used on women who want reconstructive surgery due to cancer or other disease once the technique is perfected. However, more studies will need to be conducted and the techniques further developed before commercial production can begin.

Work may included online or in-person jobs, such as writing blogs, virtual assistant, handyman, nanny, website design, dog boarding or errands, etc. The income varies depending on the job and the fee charged by the micro jobs website.  History  World War II sparked the beginning of temporary work, when housewives were employed to fill jobs vacated by men deployed to war Employers found temporary workers attractive, as they could be hired as needed and often worked hours which did not require payment of benefits and detailed paperwork. Additionally, companies could try before buy, and hire only stellar employees for full-time positions. The number of temporary workers in the United States has steadily increased. The Internet changed how workers find jobs. Websites made it possible for workers with an Internet connected device (computer, smartphone or tablet) to find virtual jobs both in their current city and worldwide.Can't Get a Job? Get a Microjob! Worker vetting processes, and on-line job review systems, build trust; which allows strangers to connect with increasing frequency. On-line micro job marketplaces offer a venue for workers, or newly termed micropreneurs, to grow their business by building up positive reviews and star-ratings. The micropreneur may then launch the business and become a traditional business owner if desired. In the past, workers were relied on classified advertisements or word-of-mouth for jobs which, offered payment, but had no safety measures and no information in regard to the person posting the job. Additionally there was no way to find temporary jobs on a real-time basis or post that a worker is available for work now. Its equivalent in the non-profit world is called \\"micro-volunteering\\" whereby individuals donate their time and skills to undertake micro-tasks such as tagging pictures or transcribing handwritten messages in support of development projects worldwide.  Controversies  Micro job workers are independent contractors and are legally responsible for their actions. The law is murky, however, on the relationship between micro job workers and marketplaces where workers find jobs. Lawsuits are expected to test this connection. In January, 2014 the Kuang-Liu family, of San Francisco, Ca.; filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Uber and driver Syed Muzzafar. The accident, which caused the death of their 6-year-old daughter and injured two other family members, was allegedly caused while Muzzafar was fulfilling a driving job from Uber.Ride service Uber faces new lawsuit after fatal San Francisco crash Individual auto insurance policies do not cover commercial activities, which may result in denials of claims if drivers are working for hire. To prevent legal complications, some ride service providers are requiring their drivers to purchase commercial insurance. Legislation for micro job worker issues remains unclear and unresolved. Advantages Micro jobs allow people to earn income to pay rent, expenses, or just earn extra spending money.How 'microjobs' help you ditch your boss Young workers may also use micro jobs as a great first step toward independence. Having a micro job can help with resume building, can set up future business relationships, and may evolve into full-time work. Micro jobs can also be done by people working from home who are self-employed. The number of websites listing micro jobs are growing and offer thousands of different micro services 35 Places to Find Micro Jobs Micro jobs sites are growing rapidly and creating a new type of on-demand income for workers. Micro jobs sites are earning billions of dollars. Disadvantages Most micro jobs don't pay benefits. Also, work might fluctuate, which means workers can't rely on a steady paycheck. Other disadvantages include difficulty in finding quality jobs, managing work and life balance, and the solitude of online work. Additionally, in the U.S., as an \\"independent contractor\\" one is obligated to report and pay income taxes on all income generated through one's commercial activities, including the performance of \\"micro jobs.\\" The U.S. Tax Code, enforced by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), requires all self-employed individuals to file quarterly tax returns detailing (among other things) any and all amounts earned from said activity, estimated annual income (from all sources, including that derived from hourly wages), as well as advance payment of income taxes based upon estimated earnings from said activity. These returns are required to be filed quarterly (every three months), and failure to do so may/will result in penalties and interest being assessed on any unpaid amounts due to the IRS. In addition, failure to estimate annual income within a 10% margin may result in additional penalties being assessed, and failure to meet all of the requirements could result in collection action being initiated by the IRS, which could include wage garnishment and seizure of personal assets, including vehicles, real property and bank accounts. The advice of a professional financial advisor should be sought before engaging in any independent earning activities (including \\"micro jobs\\") in the U.S. to determine exactly what requirements and obligations are under the law and the U.S. Tax Code.

She is the first woman to hold the position. Early life MacDonough grew up near Washington DC, graduating from Greens Farms Academy in 1984 and earning her bachelor's degree from George Washington University in 1988. Career MacDonough began her career in 1990 as a legislative reference assistant in the Senate library and later as assistant morning business editor to the Congressional Record. She left in 1995 to attend Vermont Law School, graduating with a JD in 1998. During law school, MacDonough interned with Judge Royce C. Lamberth (United States District Court for the District of Columbia) and the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Burlington, Vermont. After graduating, she worked as a trial attorney for the United States Department of Justice handling immigration cases in New Jersey. MacDonough joined the office of the Senate Parliamentarian in May 1999 as an assistant parliamentarian and was promoted to senior assistant parliamentarian in 2002. She advised then-Vice President Albert Gore on the procedure for counting ballots following Bush v. Gore. At her appointment to Parliamentarian in 2012, she was praised by outgoing Parliamentarian Alan Frumin as \\"down-to-earth,\\" describing her personal knowledge of Capitol staffers; and by Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL) as \\"smart, diligent ... and she's got integrity.\\" Sen. John Thune (R-SD) said \\"she's very steeped in the traditions of the Senate and understand how it works here\\" and Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) said he had \\"no question about her ability to read the rules and make the right decisions.\\" During the 2015 congressional effort to partially repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), MacDonough ruled the provision that would roll back the Independent Payment Advisory Board disqualified the 2015 package from consideration as a reconciliation bill in the Senate under the Byrd Rule, which requires that reconciliation bills must have a budgetary effect. Rather than the simple, filibuster-free 51-vote majority required to pass a reconciliation bill, the 2015 package would require a 60-vote threshold to pass in the Senate, which effectively killed the legislation in the Senate, as Republicans did not hold the requisite votes. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) commented MacDonough should be fired or ignored, although since the procedural rulings are officially made by the president of the Senate (in 2015, it was then-Vice President Joe Biden), firing MacDonough would have made no difference, and Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), the senior senator from Texas, dismissed Cruz's comments, saying ousting MacDonough would be \\"like firing the judge if you disagree with his ruling.\\" During the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 MacDonough ruled the repeal of the Johnson Amendment, which limits the political speech of churches, could not be included in the bill.Johnson Amendment Repeal Removed from Final GOP Tax Bill News & Reporting Christianity Today In January, 2017, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) said that MacDonough would be the person to \\"watch\\" in the Senate, because budget reconciliation would likely again be the tool used to pass amendments to the Affordable Care Act. In 2017, MacDonough read the language of Senate Rule XIX to freshman Senator Steve Daines (R-MT), which Daines carefully repeated while warning Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) for reading statements from Ted Kennedy and Coretta Scott King condemning the nomination of Jeff Sessions. The Senate subsequently voted 49 to 43 to uphold Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's objection that Warren had impugned Sessions's character. In a 2018 commencement speech at her alma mater, Vermont Law School, MacDonough called the invocation of the 'nuclear option' in 2013 and 2017 as a \\"stinging defeat that I tried not to take personally\\". The 2013 vote removed the need for a three-fifths supermajority for cloture for all executive and judicial nominations bar those for the Supreme Court, while the 2017 vote removed the requirement for nominations to the Supreme Court. MacDonough received attention prior to the 2020 impeachment trial of Donald Trump due to her role in advising Chief Justice John Roberts on parliamentary procedure while presiding over the trial. MacDonough has been praised by former President pro tempore Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and former majority whip John Cornyn (R-TX), with Leahy saying that he had \\"been here with many, many parliamentarians. All were good. But she‚Äôs the best.\\" and Cornyn saying that \\"she's tough\\" and \\"she calls them straight down the middle.\\" In June 2020, MacDonough provided a decision to Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) ruling that a vote on the Senator's WTO withdrawal resolution was in order. However, she had to reverse herself two weeks later after pressure from Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). MacDonough speaks publicly only once a year, to address the United States Senate Youth Program. Personal life MacDonough lives in Arlington, Virginia.
