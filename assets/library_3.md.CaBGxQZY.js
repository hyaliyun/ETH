It was written by Joy Wilkinson and directed by Sallie Aprahamian, and was first broadcast on BBC One on 25 November 2018. In the episode, the Thirteenth Doctor (Jodie Whittaker) travels to 17th century Lancashire, alongside her companions Graham O'Brien (Bradley Walsh), Ryan Sinclair (Tosin Cole), and Yasmin Khan (Mandip Gill), finding themselves in the middle of a witch hunt held by a local land owner. The episode was watched by 7.21 million viewers, and received generally positive reviews from critics.  Plot  The Thirteenth Doctor and her companions arrive in 1612 Lancashire near Pendle Hill. At a nearby village they find an old woman accused of witchcraft being dunked, and the Doctor tries to save her, but fails. She attempts to prevent further trials by pretending to be the Witchfinder General, fooling landowner and magistrate Becka Savage. King James arrives, complicating matters, as he assumes she is Graham's assistant. Meanwhile, Yasmin finds the old woman being buried by her granddaughter Willa Twiston, who is also Becka's cousin, and saves her from a tendril made of mud. The Doctor realises the cause of the witch hunt is of alien origin when recent victims begin to reanimate. While her companions follow the reanimated corpses, the Doctor is accused of witchcraft when confronting Becka over her hiding something. The Doctor attempts to reason with James before being dunked, escaping from her bonds underwater. Afterwards she notes how Becka could not bear touching the tree used to dunk her. As her reanimated victims approach, Becka reveals that she was infected by an alien entity while chopping down the tree atop the Hill. Becka started the witch trials thinking to find a cure. An alien entity takes over Becka's body. Speaking through her, the entity reveals herself to be queen of a race called the Morax. The tree Becka chopped down is in fact a disguised alien prison keeping the Morax war criminals within, its systems now damaged and malfunctioning. The escaping Morax intend that their king possess James and conquer Earth. The Doctor uses parts of the tree to save James and restore the prison systems. While the other Morax are forced out of their host bodies, the queen refuses to leave Becka's body. James kills them both. The following day, James tells the Doctor that all records of the events will be erased before he and Willa watch in surprise as the group leave in the TARDIS. Continuity Towards the end of the episode, when entering the TARDIS, the Doctor says \\"A brilliant man once said, 'any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.'\\" This is a reference to the third of British science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke's three laws, which was also referenced by the Seventh Doctor and his companion Ace in the episode \\"Battlefield,\\" Captain Jack Harkness in the Torchwood episode \\"Immortal Sins,\\" and sort of by the Twelfth Doctor in the episode \\"The Girl Who Died.\\" Outside reference Towards the end of the episode, when warning King James not to resume the witch trials, Graham partially quotes Quentin Tarantino's version of biblical verse Ezekiel 25:17, from his film Pulp Fiction. Historical reference When King James and Ryan talk in the forest, King James explained that his mother (Mary Queen of Scots) killed his father, a reference to the historical speculation.https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/nov/25/doctor-who- recap-series-37-episode-8-the-witchfinders  Production  Exterior scenes for \\"The Witchfinders\\" were filmed around Wales, and within Gosport, England, at the 17th century living museum of Little Woodham. Filming for the episode took place during February 2018, and overseen by Sallie Aprahamian.  Broadcast and reception   Early release  The episode was released to Amazon Prime subscribers three days before its BBC One broadcast, when the streaming service accidentally uploaded \\"The Witchfinders\\" to the slot for the seventh episode, \\"Kerblam!\\", instead of the seventh episode itself.  Ratings  \\"The Witchfinders\\" was watched by 5.66 million viewers overnight, a share of 27.9% of the total United Kingdom TV audience, making it the fourth-highest overnight viewership for the night and the nineteenth-highest overnight viewership for the week on overnights across all UK channels.

C. Allen, was a wealthy businessman in the Kingdom of Hawaii and the Territory of Hawaii. He was the namesake and nephew of Massachusetts politician Samuel Clesson Allen and a cousin to Hawaiian diplomat Elisha Hunt Allen. The bark S. C. Allen, and Port Allen on Kauai were named in his honor. Background He was born in New Salem, Massachusetts and raised in Bangor, Maine, the son of Frederick H. Allen. After receiving his basic education, he was briefly employed by Wilkinson, Stetson & Co. in Boston. The Allen family had a record of government service in both the United States and the Kingdom of Hawaii. His cousin Elisha Hunt Allen (1804‚Äì1883) was United States Minister to the Kingdom of Hawaii at the time S. C. relocated to the islands in 1850. He was the namesake of Minister Allen's father, US Congressman Samuel Clesson Allen (1772‚Äì1842).; Elisha's son William Fessenden Allen (1831‚Äì1906) would serve on the staffs of Kamehameha V, Lunalilo and KalƒÅkaua, as well as on the Advisory Council of the Provisional Government of Hawaii and the Executive Council of the Republic of Hawaii. Business After arriving in Hawaii, he used the name S. C. Allen professionally, and entered into a mercantile partnership with William A. Aldrich and John Smith Walker. In 1875, he and his brother-in- law Mark P. Robinson formed the Allen & Robinson Lumber Company and engaged in the operation of inter-island sailing ships. Allen's business enterprises extended to the sugar industry in Hawaii. He was one of the directors of C. Brewer & Co., which commissioned the New England Shipbuilding Corporation of Bath, Maine to build the bark (sailing ship) S. C. Allen. The ship was launched May 8, 1888, and sailed from Boston on June 27. After a sea route that passed Melbourne, Australia, the ship arrived in Honolulu on January 5, 1889. It was partially gutted in 1913 in Honolulu Harbor, by a fire believed to have been caused by a carelessly tossed lit cigarette. The ship was eventually rebuilt. Death and estate In his later years, he lost his vision and was dependent on family members for his mobility. When S. C. died in 1903, he left an estate valued at $2,454,464.59 (Hawaiian dollars). The bulk of it was left in trust to wife Bathsheba, Mark P. Robinson, Joseph O. Carter (confidant and legal advisor to Lili ªuokalani) and Paul Muhlendorf (VP of Allen & Robinson) and their heirs. His wife had unrestricted access to the use of the estate's assets. The individual bequests made in the will included immediate family and distant relatives, close friends and employees, and public institutions. S. C. and Bathsheba had no natural children of their own, but on November 12, 1877, they formally adopted George C. Allen (1868‚Äì1925), aka George F. Allen, aka George Clesson Fyfe Allen. In his will, S. C. nullified the adoption, leaving him $1 and disinheriting him from any claim to the estate. Citing George as having been in non-adherence to the signed Articles of Adoption, George was asked to sign a legal document relinquishing his rights to the estate. Port Allen on Kauai was originally named Eleele Landing. In 1909, terminal owner Kauai Railway renamed it for Allen. Extended family The first Allen to become related to Hawaiian royalty through marriage, albeit indirectly, was William Fessenden Allen who wed Cordelia Church Bishop (1837‚Äì1912), a cousin of Charles Reed Bishop, in 1865. Bishop was married to Bernice Pauahi PƒÅkƒ´, of the royal House of Kamehameha. In 1865, S. C. Allen married Bathsheba Maria Kulamanu Robinson (1849‚Äì1914), daughter of John James Robinson (1799‚Äì1876) and Rebecca Prever (1817‚Äì 1882), a descendant of Hawaiian chiefess Kamakana. The marriage merged two families who would influence Hawaiii's politics, ecology, and business economy for decades. Among his Robinson in-laws were: *Mark P. Robinson (1852‚Äì1915) served in the House of Nobles of the Legislature of the Kingdom of Hawaii, and Minister of Foreign Affairs during the reign of Lili ªuokalani. He was a member of the Committee of Safety that drafted the Bayonet Constitution of 1887 which codified the legislature as the supreme authority over any actions by the monarchy. He twice helped financially bail out the Hawaiian government. M.P.'s son James Lawrence Prever was a founder of the Hawaiian Broadcasting System. *Mary Robinson (1844‚Äì1930) was a philanthropist. Her husband Thomas R. Foster (1835‚Äì1889), along with his brother William, George Norton Wilcox, William B. Godfrey, and John Ena, created the Inter-Island Steam Navigation Company in 1883. The service transported passengers and cargo between the islands until 1947. The site of Foster Botanical Garden had been their homestead, bequeathed to the city of Honolulu upon her death. *Victoria Robinson (1846‚Äì1935) wed Curtis Perry Ward (1826‚Äì1882), who had ties to Lili ªuokalani and Hawaii's royal court. The couple had seven daughters, including Victoria Kathleen Ward (1878‚Äì1958) who is mentioned in S. C.'s will as his adopted daughter \\"Victoria Kathleen Ward Allen\\". This might have been the informal Hawaiian hƒÅnai tradition of adoption, since her 1958 obituary made no mention of S. C. Allen, and her legal name remained \\"Victoria Kathleen Ward\\". The site of the Ward family coconut plantation home is now the Neal S. Blaisdell Center. *Annie Robinson (1855‚Äì1921) wed Albert Jaeger (1845‚Äì1900), a German immigrant who was appointed Hawaii's commissioner of the Bureau of Forestry. He became a manager at Allen & Robinson Lumber Company. His uncle Hermann A. Widemann was Minister of Finance under Lili ªuokalani. Together, Jaeger and Widemann ran an amateur planting operation on Kauai. A biology hobbyist, Jaeger planted numerous trees on Mount Tantalus, and amassed a large collection of rare plants. Upon his death, the government was given the collection to re-plant on public lands.; References  Bibliography   External links * 1831 births 1903 deaths ","title":"S. C.

The goal was to have all patients with a centralized electronic health record by 2010. Lorenzo patient record systems were adopted in a number of NHS trusts While many hospitals acquired electronic patient records systems in this process, there was no national healthcare information exchange.   \\"The government today announced an acceleration of the dismantling of the National Programme for IT, following the conclusions of a new review by the Cabinet Office's Major Projects Authority (MPA) ... The MPA found that the National Programme for IT has not and cannot deliver to its original intent.\\"(sic) Ultimately, the program was dismantled after a cost to the UK taxpayer was over $24 Billion (¬£12 billion), and is considered one of the most expensive healthcare IT failures. In November 2013 NHS England launched a clinical digital maturity index to measure the digital maturity of NHS providers but 40% of NHS managers surveyed by the Health Service Journal did not know their ranking, and the same proportion said improving their ranking was of low or very low priority. Electronic palliative care coordination systems have been developed by Marie Curie Cancer Care and the Royal College of General Practitioners which mean that terminally ill patients no longer have to explain their circumstances afresh to every new professional they meet and are less likely to be inappropriately taken to hospital.  Personalised Health and Care 2020  The publication of Personalised Health and Care 2020 by the Department of Health elaborated a new attempt to integrate patient records. Its stated ambition was that every citizen would be able securely to access their health records online by 2018 and make real time data available to paramedics, doctors and nurses. A real time record across health and social care is seen as the key to the provision of integrated care.  Hospital systems  Transferring hospital records to electronic systems has generally been much slower and more difficult than in primary care, apart from clinical imaging, which has been largely electronic for several years. In 2019 only 10% of NHS trusts claimed to be fully digitised. Plans for a paperless NHS by 2020 are clearly not going to be realised. The NHS Long Term Plan requires all hospitals to move to digital records by 2023, so clinicians can access and interact with patient records and care plans wherever they are. 62% of trusts have plans to digitise all their patient records.  GP Systems  GP2GP is an NHS Connecting for Health project in the United Kingdom. It enables GPs to transfer a patient's electronic medical record to another practice when the patient moves onto the list. In General Practice in the UK the medical record has been computerized for many years, in fact the UK is probably one of the world leaders in this field. There are very few General Practices in the UK which are not computerized. Unlike the USA GP's have not had to deal with billing and have been able to concentrate on clinical care. The GP record is separate from the national Care Record and contains far more data. Shaun O'Hanlon, EMIS's Chief Clinical Officer says that the legal framework around data sharing is the main problem in integrating patient data because the Data Protection Act 1998 puts responsibilities on GPs to protect the confidentiality of patient data, but at the same time they have a \\"duty to share\\" when it is in the best interests of the patient. He says the quickest, easiest route to large scale record sharing is to put patients in the driving seat using smartphone technology. He quotes a YouGov poll which found that 85% of the population wanted any medical professional directly responsible for their treatment to have secure electronic access to key data from their GP record, such as long term conditions, medication history or allergies. Clinical IT suppliers are moving towards greater interoperability, already achieved with the GP2GP project allowing different systems to exchange complete medical records between practices. There are projects allowing access between hospitals & GP practices. The main Primary Care systems are EMIS Health, SystmOne, iSOFT, and INPS Vision. The NHS in Scotland widely used GPASS until 2012. From April 2014 practices are contractually required to promote and offer patients the opportunity to book appointments online, order repeat prescriptions online and provide online patient record access. The assistant coroner for inner north London has twice written to Jeremy Hunt warning that ‚Äúfuture deaths could occur [if] further action is not taken to facilitate secondary care access to GP records‚Äù. Leeds was the first city to implement the NHS Digital programme GP Connect. This makes patient records available across care settings, including social care, general practice, community, mental health and hospitals.  Patient access  It has been possible for patients to access their own medical records online for some time. By 2013, the debates had moved onto discussing the impact of patient access on patient care.

He was sired by Raven's Pass who showed top class form in Europe but is best known for being the only horse trained in Britain to win the Breeders' Cup Classic. His other foals have included Secret Number (Bosphorus Cup) and Richard Pankhurst (Hungerford Stakes). Royal Marine's dam Inner Secret, a half-sister to Dubai Destination, finished third on her only start but produced at least three other winners. Mysterial, the dam of Inner Secret and Dubai Destination, was a half-sister to Agnes World. Racing career 2018: two-year-old season Royal Marine made his debut in a minor race over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 25 August in which he was ridden by Pat Cosgrave and started the 9/4 second favourite in an eleven-runner field. He was \\"unruly\\" in the starting stalls and failed to live up to expectations in the race as he came home sixth behind Jash, more than twelve lengths behind the winner. Oisin Murphy took the ride when the colt started at odds of 11/2 for a seven furlong maiden race at Doncaster Racecourse on 14 September. Royal Marine led from the start and recorded his first success as he came home two and a quarter lengths clear of the John Gosden-trained Turgenev. On 7 October Royal Marine was sent to France and moved up sharply in class to contest the Group 1 Prix Jean-Luc Lagard√®re over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. Ridden by Murphy he started the 5/1 third choice in the betting behind Anodor (Prix des Ch√™nes) and Boitron (Denford Stakes), while the other three runners were Broome (runner-up in the Juvenile Stakes), Shaman and Dark Jedi. After racing in second place behind Broome, Royal Marine took the lead in the straight and stayed on well to win by a neck with Anodor three quarters of a length back in third place. After the race Saeed bin Suroor said \\"Royal Marine has been good since he won at Doncaster last time. What I like about him is he stays well, but he also has plenty of speed. He's a big, strong horse and in the future he could be anything. He's still a baby and he will be better in the future. We'll talk to Sheikh Mohammed and make a decision about what we are going to do\\". 2019: three-year-old season In the winter of 2018/19 Royal Marine was sent to Godolphin's base in the United Arab Emirates and made his three-year-old debut when finishing fourth in the UAE 2000 Guineas Trial at Meydan Racecourse on 10 January. On his return to Europe the colt started the 13/8 favourite for the Craven Stakes (a major trial for the 2000 Guineas) over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket. Ridden as on his previous start by Christophe Soumillon he pulled hard in the early stages before coming home fourth of the eight runners behind Skardu. In the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket on 4 May he never looked likely to take a hand in the finish and came home tenth behind Magna Graecia, beaten more than sixteen lengths by the winner. At Royal Ascot in June he started a 33/1 outsider for the St James's Palace Stakes and finished unplaced behind Circus Maximus. In July he finished last of the twelve runners behind Too Darn Hot in the Prix Jean Prat at Deauville Racecourse. A month later he was gelded.

Biography  Lozovoi was born in Novocherkassk, and was notable for his huge and powerful physique. Before the murders, he was convicted for robberies and brigandage a total of three times. On July 25, 2002, while in Rostov-on-Don, Lozovoi robbed an apartment and killed its owner, stealing a collection of antiques (jewelry and ancient orders) amounting to 400 thousand rubles. In August, he killed a taxi driver on the highway leading to the Oktyabrsky District, stealing 6 thousand rubles. In September, while he was in Sochi with accomplice Andrei Pismensky, both robbed and killed a married couple, stealing money and property worth 200 thousand rubles. In the same month, while in the vicinity of Roston-on-Don, Lozovoi killed another taxi driver, stealing 5 thousand rubles. And finally, he killed a saleswoman in the village of Bagaevskaya, robbing her of 4 thousand rubles. After the last murder, Lozovoi went into hiding, but Pismensky, the accomplice in the Sochi murder, was arrested. The offender immediately gave a confession and told about Lozovoi, after which the court sentenced Pismensky to 17 years imprisonment.–ü–æ—Ç–µ—Ä—è, –ò—Ä–∏–Ω–∞. –í –ù–æ–≤–æ—á–µ—Ä–∫–∞—Å—Å–∫–µ –∑–∞–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–ª–∏ —Å–µ—Ä–∏–π–Ω–æ–≥–æ —É–±–∏–π—Ü—É : [–∞—Ä—Ö. 18.09.2016] // –ù–æ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –ö—É—Ä—Å–∫–∞. –ö–æ–º—Å–æ–º–æ–ª—å—Å–∫–∞—è –ü—Ä–∞–≤–¥–∞ –≤ –ö—É—Ä—Å–∫–µ : —Å–∞–π—Ç. ‚Äî –ö—É—Ä—Å–∫ : –ê–û –ò–î ¬´–ö–æ–º—Å–æ–º–æ–ª—å—Å–∫–∞—è –ø—Ä–∞–≤–¥–∞¬ª, 2008. ‚Äî 27 –æ–∫—Ç—è–±—Ä—è. ‚Äî –î–∞—Ç–∞ –æ–±—Ä–∞—â–µ–Ω–∏—è: 18.09.2016. ‚Äî ISSN 0233-433X.

The US Congress included a formula of both incentives (up to $44,000 per physician under Medicare, or up to $65,000 over six years under Medicaid) and penalties (i.e. decreased Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements to doctors who fail to use EMRs by 2015, for covered patients) for EMR/EHR adoption versus continued use of paper records as part of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, enacted as part of the, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 42 CFR Parts 412, 413, 422 et al. Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Electronic Health Record Incentive Program; Final Rule The 21st Century Cures Act, passed in 2016, prohibited information blocking, which had slowed interoperability. In 2018, the Trump administration announced the MyHealthEData initiative to further allow for patients to receive their health records. The federal Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology leads these efforts. One VA study estimates its electronic medical record system may improve overall efficiency by 6% per year, and the monthly cost of an EMR may (depending on the cost of the EMR) be offset by the cost of only a few \\"unnecessary\\" tests or admissions. Jerome Groopman disputed these results, publicly asking \\"how such dramatic claims of cost-saving and quality improvement could be true\\". A 2014 survey of the American College of Physicians member sample, however, found that family practice physicians spent 48 minutes more per day when using EMRs. 90% reported that at least 1 data management function was slower after EMRs were adopted, and 64% reported that note writing took longer. A third (34%) reported that it took longer to find and review medical record data, and 32% reported that it was slower to read other clinicians' notes. Coverage In a 2008 survey by DesRoches et al. of 4484 physicians (62% response rate), 83% of all physicians, 80% of primary care physicians, and 86% of non-primary care physicians had no EHRs. \\"Among the 83% of respondents who did not have electronic health records, 16%\\" had bought, but not implemented an EHR system yet. The 2009 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey of 5200 physicians (70% response rate) by the National Center for Health Statistics showed that 51.7% of office-based physicians did not use any EMR/EHR system. In the United States, the CDC reported that the EMR adoption rate had steadily risen to 48.3 percent at the end of 2009.Are More Doctors Adopting EHRs? Retrieved 31 March 2011. This is an increase over 2008 when only 38.4% of office-based physicians reported using fully or partially electronic medical record systems (EMR) in 2008.National Center for Health : United States, 2008]. Retrieved 15 December 2009. However, the same study found that only 20.4% of all physicians reported using a system described as minimally functional and including the following features: orders for prescriptions, orders for tests, viewing laboratory or imaging results, and clinical progress notes. As of 2013, 78 percent of office physicians are using basic electronic medical records. As of 2014, more than 80 percent of hospitals in the U.S.have adopted some type of EHR. Though within a hospital, the type of EHR data and mix varies significantly. Types of EHR data used in hospitals include structured data (e.g., medication information) and unstructured data (e.g., clinical notes). The healthcare industry spends only 2% of gross revenues on Health Information Technology (HIT), which is low compared to other information intensive industries such as finance, which spend upwards of 10%. The usage of electronic medical records can vary depending on who the user is and how they are using it. Electronic medical records can help improve the quality of medical care given to patients. Many doctors and office-based physicians refuse to get rid of traditional paper records. Harvard University has conducted an experiment in which they tested how doctors and nurses use electronic medical records to keep their patients' information up to date. The studies found that electronic medical records were very useful; a doctor or a nurse was able to find a patient's information fast and easy just by typing their name; even if it was misspelled. The usage of electronic medical records increases in some workplaces due to the ease of use of the system; whereas the president of the Canadian Family Practice Nurses Association says that using electronic medical records can be time-consuming, and it isn't very helpful due to the complexity of the system. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center reported that doctors and nurses prefer to use a much more friendly user software due to the difficulty and time it takes for medical staff to input the information as well as to find a patients information. A study was done and the amount of information that was recorded in the EMRs was recorded; about 44% of the patient's information was recorded in the EMRs. This shows that EMRs are not very efficient most of the time. The cost of implementing an EMR system for smaller practices has also been criticized; data produced by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation demonstrates that the first-year investment for an average five- person practice is $162,000 followed by about $85,000 in maintenance fees. Despite this, tighter regulations regarding meaningful use criteria and national laws (Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and the Affordable Care Act) have resulted in more physicians and facilities adopting EMR systems: * Software, hardware and other services for EMR system implementation are provided for cost by various companies including Dell. * Open source EMR systems exist but have not seen widespread adoption of open-source EMR system software. Beyond financial concerns there are a number of legal and ethical dilemmas created by increasing EMR use, including the risk of medical malpractice due to user error, server glitches that result in the EMR not being accessible, and increased vulnerability to hackers.  Legal status  Electronic medical records, like other medical records, must be kept in unaltered form and authenticated by the creator.National Archives and Records Administration (NARA): Long-Term Usability of Optical Media. Retrieved 30 July 2006. Under data protection legislation, the responsibility for patient records (irrespective of the form they are kept in) is always on the creator and custodian of the record, usually a health care practice or facility. This role has been said to require changes such that the sole medico-legal record should be held elsewhere.Shabo, Amnon (2014): \\"It‚Äôs Time for Health Record Banking!\\" editorial to special issue of Methods of Information in Medicine, Vol. 53, No. 2, pp. 63‚Äì65 \\"change in current legislation so that the copy of a legally-authenticated medical record stored in an IHRB [Independent Health Record Bank] is the sole medico-legal record and healthcare providers are no longer required by the law to hold archives of medical records.\\" page 65, The physical medical records are the property of the medical provider (or facility) that prepares them. This includes films and tracings from diagnostic imaging procedures such as X-ray, CT, PET, MRI, ultrasound, etc. The patient, however, according to HIPAA, has a right to view the originals, and to obtain copies under law.Medical Board of California: Medical Records ‚Äì Frequently Asked Questions . Retrieved 30 July 2006. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) (,¬ß2.A.III & B.4) (a part of the 2009 stimulus package) set meaningful use of interoperable EHR adoption in the health care system as a critical national goal and incentivized EHR adoption. The \\"goal is not adoption alone but 'meaningful use' of EHRs‚Äîthat is, their use by providers to achieve significant improvements in care.\\" Title IV of the act promises maximum incentive payments for Medicaid to those who adopt and use \\"certified EHRs\\" of $63,750 over 6 years beginning in 2011. Eligible professionals must begin receiving payments by 2016 to qualify for the program. For Medicare the maximum payments are $44,000 over 5 years. Doctors who do not adopt an EHR by 2015 will be penalized 1% of Medicare payments, increasing to 3% over 3 years. In order to receive the EHR stimulus money, the HITECH Act requires doctors to show \\"meaningful use\\" of an EHR system. As of June 2010, there were no penalty provisions for Medicaid. In 2017 the government announced its first False Claims Act settlement with an electronic health records vendor for misrepresenting its ability to meet ‚Äúmeaningful use‚Äù standards and therefore receive incentive payments. eClinicalWorks paid $155 million to settle charges that it had failed to meet all government requirements, failed to adequately test its software, failed to fix certain bugs, failed to ensure data portability, and failed to reliably record laboratory and diagnostic imaging orders. The government also alleged that eClinicalWorks paid kickbacks to influential customers who recommended its products. The case marks the first time the government applied the federal Anti-Kickback Statute law to the promotion and sale of an electronic health records system.\\"EHR vendor eClinicalWorks reaches ground-breaking $155 million whistleblower settlement\\", Phillips & Cohen LLP Press Release, May 31, 2017 The False Claims Act lawsuit was brought by a whistleblower who was a New York City employee implementing eClinicalWorks‚Äô system at Rikers Island Correctional Facility when he became aware of the software flaws. His ‚Äúqui tam‚Äù case was later joined by the government. Notably, CMS has said it will not punish eClinicalWorks clients that \\"in good faith\\" attested to using the software. Health information exchange (HIE) has emerged as a core capability for hospitals and physicians to achieve \\"meaningful use\\" and receive stimulus funding. Healthcare vendors are pushing HIE as a way to allow EHR systems to pull disparate data and function on a more interoperable level. Starting in 2015, hospitals and doctors will be subject to financial penalties under Medicare if they are not using electronic health records.  Goals and objectives  * Improve care quality, safety, efficiency, and reduce health disparities :: Quality and safety measurement :: Clinical decision support (automated advice) for providers :: Patient registries (e.g., \\"a directory of patients with diabetes\\") * Improve care coordination * Engage patients and families in their care * Improve population and public health :: Electronic laboratory reporting for reportable conditions (hospitals) :: Immunization reporting to immunization registries :: Syndromic surveillance (health event awareness) * Ensure adequate privacy and security protections  Quality  Studies call into question whether, in real life, EMRs improve the quality of care. 2009 produced several articles raising doubts about EMR benefits. A major concern is the reduction of physician-patient interaction due to formatting constraints. For example, some doctors have reported that the use of check- boxes has led to fewer open-ended questions.Cohen GR, Grossman JM, O'Malley AS (2010). \\"Electronic Medical Records and Communication with Patients and Other Clinicians: Are We Talking Less?\\". Center for Studying Health System Change, Issue Brief No. 131 (full text)  Meaningful use  The main components of meaningful use are: * The use of a certified EHR in a meaningful manner, such as e-prescribing. * The use of certified EHR technology for the electronic exchange of health information to improve the quality of health care. * The use of certified EHR technology to submit clinical quality and other measures. In other words, providers need to show they're using certified EHR technology in ways that can be measured significantly in quality and in quantity. The meaningful use of EHRs intended by the US government incentives is categorized as follows: * Improve care coordination * Reduce healthcare disparities * Engage patients and their families * Improve population and public health * Ensure adequate privacy and security The Obama Administration's Health IT program intends to use federal investments to stimulate the market of electronic health records: * Incentives: to providers who use IT * Strict and open standards: To ensure users and sellers of EHRs work towards the same goal * Certification of software: To provide assurance that the EHRs meet basic quality, safety, and efficiency standards The detailed definition of \\"meaningful use\\" is to be rolled out in 3 stages over a period of time until 2017. Details of each stage are hotly debated by various groups.  Meaningful use Stage 1  The first steps in achieving meaningful use are to have a certified electronic health record (EHR) and to be able to demonstrate that it is being used to meet the requirements. Stage 1 contains 25 objectives/measures for Eligible Providers (EPs) and 24 objectives/measures for eligible hospitals. The objectives/measures have been divided into a core set and menu set. EPs and eligible hospitals must meet all objectives/measures in the core set (15 for EPs and 14 for eligible hospitals). EPs must meet 5 of the 10 menu-set items during Stage 1, one of which must be a public health objective. Full list of the Core Requirements and a full list of the Menu Requirements. Core Requirements: # Use computerized order entry for medication orders. # Implement drug-drug, drug-allergy checks. # Generate and transmit permissible prescriptions electronically. # Record demographics. # Maintain an up-to-date problem list of current and active diagnoses. # Maintain active medication list. # Maintain active medication allergy list. # Record and chart changes in vital signs. # Record smoking status for patients 13 years old or older. # Implement one clinical decision support rule. # Report ambulatory quality measures to CMS or the States. # Provide patients with an electronic copy of their health information upon request. # Provide clinical summaries to patients for each office visit. # Capability to exchange key clinical information electronically among providers and patient authorized entities. # Protect electronic health information (privacy & security) Menu Requirements: # Implement drug-formulary checks. # Incorporate clinical lab-test results into certified EHR as structured data. # Generate lists of patients by specific conditions to use for quality improvement, reduction of disparities, research, and outreach. # Send reminders to patients per patient preference for preventive/ follow-up care # Provide patients with timely electronic access to their health information (including lab results, problem list, medication lists, allergies) # Use certified EHR to identify patient-specific education resources and provide to the patient if appropriate. # Perform medication reconciliation as relevant # Provide a summary care record for transitions in care or referrals. # Capability to submit electronic data to immunization registries and actual submission. # Capability to provide electronic syndromic surveillance data to public health agencies and actual transmission. To receive federal incentive money, CMS requires participants in the Medicare EHR Incentive Program to \\"attest\\" that during a 90-day reporting period, they used a certified EHR and met Stage 1 criteria for meaningful use objectives and clinical quality measures. For the Medicaid EHR Incentive Program, providers follow a similar process using their state's attestation system.Torrieri, Marisa \\"Dealing with Meaningful Use Attestation Aggravation\\" . Physicians Practice. January 2012.  Meaningful use Stage 2  The government released its final ruling on achieving Stage 2 of meaningful use in August 2012. Eligible providers will need to meet 17 of 20 core objectives in Stage 2, and fulfill three out of six menu objectives. The required percentage of patient encounters that meet each objective has generally increased over the Stage 1 objectives. While Stage 2 focuses more on information exchange and patient engagement, many large EHR systems have this type of functionality built into their software, making it easier to achieve compliance. Also, for those eligible providers who have successfully attested to Stage 1, meeting Stage 2 should not be as difficult, as it builds incrementally on the requirements for the first stage.\\"Meaningful Use: Stage 2 Regulations Overview\\" Robert Anthony, CMS, 30 August 2012.\\"EHR Incentive Program: A Progress Report\\" Marisa Torrieri, Physicians Practice, September 2012.  Meaningful use Stage 3  On March 20, 2015 CMS released its proposed rule for Stage 3 meaningful use. These new rules focus on some of the tougher aspects of Stage 2 and require healthcare providers to vastly improve their EHR adoption and care delivery by 2018.  Barriers to adoption   Costs  The price of EMR and provider uncertainty regarding the value they will derive from adoption in the form of return on investment have a significant influence on EMR adoption. In a project initiated by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information, surveyors found that hospital administrators and physicians who had adopted EMR noted that any gains in efficiency were offset by reduced productivity as the technology was implemented, as well as the need to increase information technology staff to maintain the system. The U.S. Congressional Budget Office concluded that the cost savings may occur only in large integrated institutions like Kaiser Permanente, and not in small physician offices. They challenged the Rand Corporation's estimates of savings. > Office-based physicians in particular may see no benefit if they purchase > such a product‚Äîand may even suffer financial harm. Even though the use of > health IT could generate cost savings for the health system at large that > might offset the EMR's cost, many physicians might not be able to reduce > their office expenses or increase their revenue sufficiently to pay for it. > For example. the use of health IT could reduce the number of duplicated > diagnostic tests. However, that improvement in efficiency would be unlikely > to increase the income of many physicians. ...Given the ease at which > information can be exchanged between health IT systems, patients whose > physicians use them may feel that their privacy is more at risk than if > paper records were used.Evidence on the costs and benefits of health > information technology. Doubts have been raised about cost saving from EMRs by researchers at Harvard University, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, Stanford University, and others. = Start-up costs = In a survey by DesRoches et al. (2008), 66% of physicians without EHRs cited capital costs as a barrier to adoption, while 50% were uncertain about the investment. Around 56% of physicians without EHRs stated that financial incentives to purchase and/or use EHRs would facilitate adoption. In 2002, initial costs were estimated to be $50,000‚Äì70,000 per physician in a 3-physician practice. Since then, costs have decreased with increasing adoption. A 2011 survey estimated a cost of $32,000 per physician in a 5-physician practice during the first 60 days of implementation. One case study by Miller et al. (2005) of 14 small primary- care practices found that the average practice paid for the initial and ongoing costs within 2.5 years. A 2003 cost-benefit analysis found that using EMRs for 5 years created a net benefit of $86,000 per provider. Some physicians are skeptical of the positive claims and believe the data is skewed by vendors and others with an interest in EHR implementation. Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, estimated it achieved net savings of $5 million to $10 million per year following installation of a computerized physician order entry system that reduced serious medication errors by 55 percent. Another large hospital generated about $8.6 million in annual savings by replacing paper medical charts with EHRs for outpatients and about $2.8 million annually by establishing electronic access to laboratory results and reports. = Maintenance costs = Maintenance costs can be high. Miller et al. found the average estimated maintenance cost was $8500 per FTE health- care provider per year. Furthermore, software technology advances at a rapid pace. Most software systems require frequent updates, sometimes even server upgrades, and often at a significant ongoing cost. Some types of software and operating systems require full-scale re-implementation periodically, which disrupts not only the budget but also workflow. Costs for upgrades and associated regression testing can be particularly high where the applications are governed by FDA regulations (e.g. Clinical Laboratory systems). Physicians desire modular upgrades and ability to continually customize, without large- scale reimplementation. = Training costs = Training of employees to use an EHR system is costly, just as for training in the use of any other hospital system. New employees, permanent or temporary, will also require training as they are hired. In the United States, a substantial majority of healthcare providers train at a VA facility sometime during their career. With the widespread adoption of the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic health record system at all VA facilities, fewer recently-trained medical professionals will be inexperienced in electronic health record systems. Older practitioners who are less experienced in the use of electronic health record systems will retire over time.  Software quality and usability deficiencies  The Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, a very large U.S. health care IT industry trade group, observed that EMR adoption rates \\"have been slower than expected in the United States, especially in comparison to other industry sectors and other developed countries. A key reason, aside from initial costs and lost productivity during EMR implementation, is lack of efficiency and usability of EMRs currently available.\\"Defining and Testing EMR Usability. Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, June 2009. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology of the Department of Commerce studied usability in 2011 and lists a number of specific issues that have been reported by health care workers. The U.S. military's EMR \\"AHLTA\\" was reported to have significant usability issues.  Lack of semantic interoperability  In the United States, there are no standards for semantic interoperability of health care data; there are only syntactic standards. This means that while data may be packaged in a standard format (using the pipe notation of HL7, or the bracket notation of XML), it lacks definition, or linkage to a common shared dictionary. The addition of layers of complex information models (such as the HL7 v3 RIM) does not resolve this fundamental issue. As of 2018, Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources was a leading interoperability standard, and the Argonaut Project is a privately sponsored interoperability initiative. In 2017, Epic Systems announced Share Everywhere, which lets providers access medical information through a portal; their platform was described as \\"closed\\" in 2014, with competitors sponsoring the CommonWell Health Alliance. The economics of sharing have been blamed for the lack of interoperability, as limited data sharing can help providers retain customers.  Implementations  In the United States, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has the largest enterprise-wide health information system that includes an electronic medical record, known as the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA). A key component in VistA is their VistA imaging System which provides a comprehensive multimedia data from many specialties, including cardiology, radiology, and orthopedics. A graphical user interface known as the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) allows health care providers to review and update a patient's electronic medical record at any of the VA's over 1,000 healthcare facilities. CPRS includes the ability to place orders, including medications, special procedures, X-rays, patient care nursing orders, diets, and laboratory tests. The 2003 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) ensured that the VA and DoD would work together to establish a bidirectional exchange of reference quality medical images. Initially, demonstrations were only worked in El Paso, Texas, but capabilities have been expanded to six different locations of VA and DoD facilities. These facilities include VA polytrauma centers in Tampa and Richmond, Denver, North Chicago, Biloxi, and the National Capitol Area medical facilities. Radiological images such as CT scans, MRIs, and x-rays are being shared using the BHIE. Goals of the VA and DoD in the near future are to use several image sharing solutions (VistA Imaging and DoD Picture Archiving & Communications System (PACS) solutions). Electronic health records flow chart Clinical Data Repository/Health Data Repository (CDHR) is a database that allows for the sharing of patient records, especially allergy and pharmaceutical information, between the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense (DoD) in the United States. The program shares data by translating the various vocabularies of the information being transmitted, allowing all of the VA facilities to access and interpret the patient records. The Laboratory Data Sharing and Interoperability (LDSI) application is a new program being implemented to allow sharing at certain sites between the VA and DoD of \\"chemistry and hematology laboratory tests\\". Unlike the CHDR, the LDSI is currently limited in its scope. One attribute for the start of implementing EHRs in the States is the development of the Nationwide Health Information Network which is a work in progress and still being developed. This started with the North Carolina Healthcare Information and Communication Alliance founded in 1994 and who received funding from Department of Health and Human Services. The Department of Veterans Affairs and Kaiser Permanente has a pilot program to share health records between their systems VistA and HealthConnect, respectively. This software called 'CONNECT' uses Nationwide Health Information Network standards and governance to make sure that health information exchanges are compatible with other exchanges being set up throughout the country. CONNECT is an open-source software solution that supports electronic health information exchange. The CONNECT initiative is a Federal Health Architecture project that was conceived in 2007 and initially built by 20 various federal agencies and now comprises more than 500 organizations including federal agencies, states, healthcare providers, insurers, and health IT vendors. The US Indian Health Service uses an EHR similar to Vista called RPMS. VistA Imaging is also being used to integrate images and co-ordinate PACS into the EHR system. In Alaska, use of the EHR by the Kodiak Area Native Association has improved screening services and helped the organization reach all 21 clinical performance measures defined by the Indian Health Service as required by the Government Performance and Results Act. Privacy and confidentiality In the United States in 2011 there were 380 major data breaches involving 500 or more patients' records listed on the website kept by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights. So far, from the first wall postings in September 2009 through the latest on 8 December 2012, there have been 18,059,831 \\"individuals affected,\\" and even that massive number is an undercount of the breach problem. The civil rights office has not released all of the records of tens of thousands of breaches in the United States, it has received under a federal reporting mandate on breaches affecting fewer than 500 patients per incident. Privacy concerns in healthcare apply to both paper and electronic records. According to the Los Angeles Times, roughly 150 people (from doctors and nurses to technicians and billing clerks) have access to at least part of a patient's records during a hospitalization, and 600,000 payers, providers and other entities that handle providers' billing data have some access also. Recent revelations of \\"secure\\" data breaches at centralized data repositories, in banking and other financial institutions, in the retail industry, and from government databases, have caused concern about storing electronic medical records in a central location. Records that are exchanged over the Internet are subject to the same security concerns as any other type of data transaction over the Internet. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) was passed in the US in 1996 to establish rules for access, authentications, storage and auditing, and transmittal of electronic medical records. This standard made restrictions for electronic records more stringent than those for paper records. However, there are concerns as to the adequacy of these standards. In the United States, information in electronic medical records is referred to as Protected Health Information (PHI) and its management is addressed under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) as well as many local laws.US Code of Federal Regulations, Title45, Volume 1 (Revised 1 October 2005): of Individually Identifiable Health Information (45CFR164.501). Retrieved 30 July 2006. The HIPAA protects a patient's information; the information that is protected under this act are: information doctors and nurses input into the electronic medical record, conversations between a doctor and a patient that may have been recorded, as well as billing information. Under this act there is a limit as to how much information can be disclosed, and as well as who can see a patient's information. Patients also get to have a copy of their records if they desire, and get notified if their information is ever to be shared with third parties. Covered entities may disclose protected health information to law enforcement officials for law enforcement purposes as required by law (including court orders, court-ordered warrants, subpoenas) and administrative requests; or to identify or locate a suspect, fugitive, material witness, or missing person.Summary of the HIPAA Privacy Rule Medical and health care providers experienced 767 security breaches resulting in the compromised confidential health information of 23,625,933 patients during the period of 2006‚Äì2012.Privacy Rights Clearinghouse's Chronology of Data Security Breaches One major issue that has risen on the privacy of the US network for electronic health records is the strategy to secure the privacy of patients. Former US president George W. Bush called for the creation of networks, but federal investigators report that there is no clear strategy to protect the privacy of patients as the promotions of the electronic medical records expands throughout the United States. In 2007, the Government Accountability Office reports that there is a \\"jumble of studies and vague policy statements but no overall strategy to ensure that privacy protections would be built into computer networks linking insurers, doctors, hospitals and other health care providers.\\" The privacy threat posed by the interoperability of a national network is a key concern. One of the most vocal critics of EMRs, New York University Professor Jacob M. Appel, has claimed that the number of people who will need to have access to such a truly interoperable national system, which he estimates to be 12 million, will inevitably lead to breaches of privacy on a massive scale. Appel has written that while \\"hospitals keep careful tabs on who accesses the charts of VIP patients,\\" they are powerless to act against \\"a meddlesome pharmacist in Alaska\\" who \\"looks up the urine toxicology on his daughter's fiance in Florida, to check if the fellow has a cocaine habit.\\" This is a significant barrier for the adoption of an EHR. Accountability among all the parties that are involved in the processing of electronic transactions including the patient, physician office staff, and insurance companies, is the key to successful advancement of the EHR in the US Supporters of EHRs have argued that there needs to be a fundamental shift in \\"attitudes, awareness, habits, and capabilities in the areas of privacy and security\\" of individual's health records if adoption of an EHR is to occur. According to The Wall Street Journal, the DHHS takes no action on complaints under HIPAA, and medical records are disclosed under court orders in legal actions such as claims arising from automobile accidents. HIPAA has special restrictions on psychotherapy records, but psychotherapy records can also be disclosed without the client's knowledge or permission, according to the Journal. For example, Patricia Galvin, a lawyer in San Francisco, saw a psychologist at Stanford Hospital & Clinics after her fiance committed suicide. Her therapist had assured her that her records would be confidential. But after she applied for disability benefits, Stanford gave the insurer her therapy notes, and the insurer denied her benefits based on what Galvin claims was a misinterpretation of the notes. Within the private sector, many companies are moving forward in the development, establishment, and implementation of medical record banks and health information exchange. By law, companies are required to follow all HIPAA standards and adopt the same information-handling practices that have been in effect for the federal government for years. This includes two ideas, standardized formatting of data electronically exchanged and federalization of security and privacy practices among the private sector. Private companies have promised to have \\"stringent privacy policies and procedures.\\" If protection and security are not part of the systems developed, people will not trust the technology nor will they participate in it. There is also debate over ownership of data, where private companies tend to value and protect data rights, but the patients referenced in these records may not have knowledge that their information is being used for commercial purposes. In 2013, reports based on documents released by Edward Snowden revealed that the NSA had succeeded in breaking the encryption codes protecting electronic health records, among other databases. In 2015, 4.5 million health records were hacked at UCLA Medical Center. In 2018, Social Indicators Research published the scientific evidence of 173,398,820 (over 173 million) individuals affected in USA from October 2008 (when the data were collected) to September 2017 (when the statistical analysis took place). Regulatory compliance * Health Level 7 In the United States, reimbursement for many healthcare services is based upon the extent to which specific work by healthcare providers is documented in the patient's medical record. Enforcement authorities in the United States have become concerned that functionality available in many electronic health records, especially copy- and-paste, may enable fraudulent claims for reimbursement. The authorities are concerned that healthcare providers may easily use these systems to create documentation of medical care that did not actually occur. These concerns came to the forefront in 2012, in a joint letter from the U.S. Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services to the American hospital community.U.S.Department of Health & Human Services and U.S. Departments of Justice Letter The American Hospital Association responded, focusing on the need for clear guidance from the government regarding permissible and prohibited conduct using electronic health records. In a December 2013 audit report, the U.S. HHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) issued an audit report reiterating that vulnerabilities continue to exist in the operation of electronic health records. The OIG's 2014 Workplan indicates an enhanced focus on providers' use of electronic health records. Medical data breach The Security Rule, according to Health and Human Services (HHS), establishes a security framework for small practices as well as large institutions. All covered entities must have a written security plan. The HHS identifies three components as necessary for the security plan: administrative safeguards, physical safeguards, and technical safeguards. However, medical and healthcare providers have experienced 767 security breaches resulting in the compromised confidential health information of 23,625,933 patients during the period of 2006‚Äì2012.Privacy Rights Clearinghouse's Chronology of Data Security Breaches involving Medical Information The Health Insurance Portability and Accessibility Act requires safeguards to limit the number of people who have access to personal information. However, given the number of people who may have access to your information as part of the operations and business of the health care provider or plan, there is no realistic way to estimate the number of people who may come across your records. Additionally, law enforcement access is authorized under the act. In some cases, medical information may be disclosed without a warrant or court order. Breach notification The Security Rule that was adopted in 2005 did not require breach notification. However, notice might be required by state laws that apply to a variety of industries, including health care providers. In California, a law has been in place since 2003 requiring that a HIPAA covered organization's breach could have triggered a notice even though notice was not required by the HIPAA Security Rule. Since 1 January 2009, California residents are required to receive notice of a health information breach. Federal law and regulations now provide rights to notice of a breach of health information. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act requires HHS and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to jointly study and report on privacy and data security of personal health information. HITECH also requires the agencies to issue breach notification rules that apply to HIPAA covered entities and Web-based vendors that store health information electronically. The FTC has adopted rules regarding breach notification for internet-based vendors.Department of Health and Human Services Breach Notification for Unsecured Protected Health Information  Vendors  Vendors often focus on software for specific healthcare providers, including acute hospitals or ambulatory care. In the hospital market, Epic, Cerner, MEDITECH, and CSPI (Evident Thrive) had the top market share at 28%, 26%, 9%, and 6% in 2018. For large hospitals with over 500 beds, Epic and Cerner had over 85% market share in 2019. In ambulatory care, Practice Fusion had the highest satisfaction, while in acute hospital care Epic scored relatively well. Interoperability is a focus for systems; in 2018, Epic and athenahealth were rated highly for interoperability. Interoperability has been lacking, but is enhanced by certain compatibility features (e.g., Epic interoperates with itself via CareEverywhere) or in some cases regional or national networks, such as EHealth Exchange, CommonWell Health Alliance, and Carequality. Vendors may use anonymized data for their own business or research purposes; for example, as of 2019 Cerner and AWS partnered using data for a machine learning tool.  History  As of 2006, systems with a computerized provider order entry (CPOE) had existed for more than 30 years, but by 2006 only 10% of hospitals had a fully integrated system.Smaltz, Detlev and Eta Berner.

It was in the Palazzo Farnese in Rome until 1662, when it moved to Parma. There it hung in the Palazzo del Giardino and later in the Galleria Ducale - the 'Descrizione' of the latter in 1725 called it one of the finest works on display there. It and the rest of the Farnese collection were later moved to Naples and the work was exhibited for a few years in the Palazzo Reale before moving to its present home in the National Museum of Capodimonte. Two early copies remain in the Galleria Nazionale and Palazzo Comunale in Parma. Its attribution to Parmigianino is almost undisputed, though its dating is more debated - some scholars place it in his period in Rome (1524-1527) and others to his time in Bologna (1527-1530), whilst Freedberg argues it belonged to a second stay in Parma (1530-1539). Its technique and style probably date it to his time in Bologna - the mineral colours are typical of work in fresco and the work is in glue tempera or gouache. Vasari records Parmigianino painting two works in gouache in Bologna \\"for Master Luca di Leuti\\". Four preparatory drawings for the work survive (one each) in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle (RCIN 990346), the Galleria nazionale di Parma (inv. 510/5), the British Museum (1905,1110.18) and the Ashmolean Museum (inv. 446).

He was therefore made royal commissioner with the task of investigating irregularities allegedly committed by the Danish East India Company governor of Tranquebar, Axel Juel. Kalnein travelled to India on three merchant-men, accompanied by some military specialists who would restore the defences of Fort Dansborg. He returned in 1687 with Governor Juel as prisoner, and with four captured privateers and a captured English ship that had sailed under the Mughal flag. Returning to the army as a colonel in 1688, Kalnein was the following year made commander of Prince Frederick's Battalion in the Danish Auxiliary Corps in Ireland.

Following on from the principles developed in the operation of the UK's previous STOVL aircraft, the Harrier, the formation is a joint organisation falling under RAF Air Command. History The Lightning Force concept was established during the planning stages for the introduction into UK service of the F-35B, taking the idea that had previously been put in place for the operation of the Harrier. This saw the units of both the Fleet Air Arm and Royal Air Force amalgamated under a single command structure, with crews of both services intermixing in all units. Initially, two operational squadrons were formed to operate the F-35; in July 2013, 617 Squadron was announced as the first operational F-35 squadron, while in September 2013, 809 Naval Air Squadron became the first Fleet Air Arm squadron. These would be tasked primarily with operating from the Royal Navy's new s, as well as from deployed air bases. The intention is to form two further squadrons, one each from the Fleet Air Arm and RAF, as well as an Operational Conversion Unit, which was formed as 207 Squadron in August 2019. The Lightning Force was formed as a command organisation in October 2015. In the summer of 2018, 617 Squadron began the process of bringing its new aircraft across the Atlantic to the home base of the new Lightning Force, RAF Marham in Norfolk. The first four aircraft made the transit on 7 June 2018, with another five following in August. In October 2018, undertook the first trial operations of F-35s during her deployment to the United States. 617 Squadron is planned to declare initial operating capability for land based operations by the end of 2018, before beginning carrier trials. 809 Naval Air Squadron is intended to reform by 2023. Two further operational squadrons, one as part of the RAF and the other in the Fleet Air Arm, are also due to be formed. In May 2019, 617 Squadron took six of its aircraft to RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, the first time the United Kingdom had sent the F-35 on an overseas deployment. This was undertaken to test the capabilities of the F-35, its crews and support structures on an overseas tour. During this deployment, the aircraft undertook their first operational missions, being used on a total of 14 armed reconnaissance overflights of Syria and Iraq as part of Operation Shader. In October 2019, Lightnings of 17 Squadron became the first UK-owned examples to begin operating from HMS Queen Elizabeth during the ship's Westlant 19 deployment to the United States, which saw the second-stage flying trials undertaken to continue preparations for the eventual declaration of carrier strike capability. This was followed in early 2020 by 207 Squadron undertaking its first period of carrier qualifications, which was also the first time that the Lightning had operated from a carrier in UK waters. In 2021, Queen Elizabeth will sail on her first operational deployment, with sixteen F-35s including as part of the ship's air group - of these, eight will be British aircraft operated by 617 Squadron, while the remainder will be from VMFA-211, a squadron of the United States Marine Corps.

Dedicated to Saint George, the 13th-century church comes under the Diocese of Exeter and has been designated a Grade I listed building since 25 February 1965.St George's Church, Georgeham - Historic England Listed Building database History The 13th-century effigy to Sir Mauger de St Aubyn III (died 1294) The first record of a church in the village was in 1231St George's Church - Georgeham Parish Council website when Robert de Edington was recorded as the 'persona' or parson and patron of Hamme. There may have been an earlier church on the site in Saxon or Norman times but there is no firm evidence for this other than some 13th- century artifacts in the church. These include a stone font to the right of the altar; a small carving of the Crucifixion in the chancel c.1300 with mutilated heads to Christ and two flanking figures of John and Mary with weeping angels to each end of the Cross; a piscina on the south wall of the Pickwell Chapel, and a prone effigy of a knight also in the Pickwell Chapel (c1294). Also, there is a small quatrefoil window in the north wall of the chancel near the altar and a trefoil-headed piscina in the chancel, both dating to the 14th-century. The first record of the church being dedicated to Saint George was in 1356.Rev Mike Newbon and Brian Harris, Guide to St George's Church, Georgeham, (ND) pg 4 Built of random stone rubble with large blocks to tower, the building has ashlar dressings to the openings and dressed stone quoins. The oldest part of the building is the 14th-century tower which is of three stages with set back buttresses and an embattled parapet and stair turret with four slit windows to the north side. Externally on the east side of the tower there are traces of a higher nave than the present one. The main arcade between the nave and side aisle with its arches is most likely 15th- century.Guide, pg 5 Design The Pickwell Chapel with its Georgian Screen The south porch bears a wall sundial dated 1773 which may also be the date of the porch. A major restoration in 1762 changed the church interior to a Classic or Romanesque style at which time most of the windows were altered. The wooden screen between the nave and the Pickwell Chapel with its Corinthian pilasters and broken segmental pediment dates to this time and was restored in 1912. New boxed seating was installed in 1767 together with raised galleries for the gentry on the west wall.Guide, pg 6 Further restoration took place under James FowlerNikolaus Pevsner, The Buildings of England: North Devon, Penguin Books (1952) pg 89 in 1876 when the box pews in the nave were replaced with the current pews and the elevated gallery was removed. The vestry was enlarged and parts of the chancel were rebuilt. The Last Supper reredos above the altar dates from this period while a new pulpit of Caen stone was installed; this has carvings of St John the Baptist in the wilderness, the Sermon on the Mount and Saint Paul in Athens. There are unceiled waggon roofs to nave and south aisle with carved bosses at each of the intersections. The arcade of bays has Pevsner 'B' type piers with leaf capitals to the main shafts.Guide, pg 7 Memorials Mural monument to Tobie Newcourt (d.1645) and his descendants The Harris Family Monument The stone effigy in the Pickwell Chapel is of Sir Mauger de St Aubyn III who fought the Welsh in 1283 and who died in 1294. Some records state that he was of giant-like stature and of so great a strength that he threw a heavy stone into Georgeham over a great distance and two strong men of half his age could not lift it. His effigy shows him as 6 feet tall, cross-legged with two dogs at his feet, a sword, shield and supportive angels. His wife Isabella de Pidekswell is also buried in the church but her monument has not survived, most probably having been moved during the Georgian or Victorian restorations.Guide, pg 8 The Newcourt Family monument (see left) is the oldest wall memorial in the church dating to 1645 and is dedicated to Tobie Newcourt. It show Tobie Newcourt his son William and his four sons: John, William, Tobie and another John. The two female heads represent the wives of Tobie and his son.Guide, pg 9 The Harris Family monument dates to 1776 and was erected by Honour Harris in the Pickwell Chapel to her parents Dorothy and John Harris (MP for Barnstaple) and their three children who had died in infancy. On Honour Harris's death a cameo carving of her was placed on the monument.Guide, pg 10 The memorial to the Chichester Family is on the wall to the right of the altar and is to William Chichester, who was Rector at St George's church from 1750 to 1770, and his wife, Mary. The memorial also mentions his daughter Ann Chichester (1751-1780).Guide, pg 11 The large bible in the Pickwell Chapel is a memento to Archibald Cleveland who took part in the Charge of the Light Brigade in October 1854 but who was subsequently killed during the Battle of Inkerman in November 1854. On the north wall of the nave is a memorial to Croyde resident Henry Tinker who drowned in 1916 while trying to save a lady who had gotten into difficulties off Croyde Beach. The plaque shows the Royal Humane Society Medal which was awarded to him posthumously. The copper insignia can rotate on its centre to show both faces of the disc. The Parish Map The Parish Map tapestry On the south wall of the nave is a tapestry map of Georgeham Parish which was unveiled in 1995. The stitching took more than 3,000 hours to complete and was achieved with the co-operation of about 85 Georgeham and Croyde artists and embroiderers, with 70 children from Georgeham Primary School also contributing. The project was initiated by the Women's Institute and commemorated the 75th anniversary of the founding of the WI in the Devon area and was displayed at The Barbican in London in 1996. Other features The Sanctuary View up the nave The stained glass is mainly 19th and 20th- century with the exception of the north quatrefoil window which is 14th- century and which was discovered hidden during the Victorian restoration. It was repositioned in the chancel and glazed with a picture of an angel holding a scroll on which is written \\"Sanctus Sanctus Sanctus\\".Guide, pg 16 The organ was installed in 1881 in memory of Frances Hole, wife of the Rev Francis Hole who was Rector from 1831 to 1866. The organ was restored in 1999 at a cost of ¬£10,000 when the hand pump was converted to an electric one. The tower has a peal of eight bells: five were cast in 1748, one in 1765 and the last two in 1926. The church clock was installed in 1921 in memory of those parishioners who died on active service during World War I and was paid for by residents of the village. In 2014 as part of the WWI centenary commemoration the dial and hands were regilded and an electric winding mechanism was installed. The murals on either side of the altar represent Saints Francis and George, the Archangel and the Virgin Mary and are the work of artist Margaret Kemp-Welch, who lived in the village during the 1920s and 1930s.

The main event was the Eponymous IWRG Rey del Ring tournament, the fifteenth annual version of the tournament, IWRG's version of WWE's Royal Rumble, multi- man elimination event. In IWRG the winner of the Rey del Ring tournament also wins the IWRG Rey del Ring Championship, after the previous champion Imposible vacated the championship prior to the match. Imposible outlasted 29 other wrestlers to win the 2017 version of the tournament and the championship. The show included four additional matches. Background The Mexican professional wrestling company International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; at times referred to as Grupo Internacional Revoluci√≥n in Mexico) started their annual Rey del Ring (\\"King of the Ring\\") event in 2002, creating an annual event around the eponymous Rey del Ring match, a 30-man elimination match similar in concept to the WWE's Royal Rumble match. From 2002 until the 2011 event the \\"prize\\" for winning the match itself was simply the prestige of outlasting 29 other competitors, but at the 2011 Rey del Ring IWRG introduced the IWR Rey del Ring Championship complete with a belt to symbolize the championship that would be awarded to the winner each year. At that point in time the Rey del Ring title became a championship that could be defended and lost or won in matches in between the annual tournaments. For the tournament the champion would vacate the Rey del Ring Championship prior to the actual Rey del Ring match itself. All Rey del Ring shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general are held in Arena Naucalpan, owned by the promoters of IWRG and their main arena. The 2017 Rey del Ring was the fifteenth over all Rey del Ring tournament held by IWRG. Event The Rey del Ring event featured four professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Prior to the main event M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. came to the ring carrying the IWRG Rey del Ring Championship belt with him. He looked visibly upset over having to give up the championship and immediately challenged the next champion to a match since he was not losing the championship in a match. The Rey del Ring tournament is a 30-man battle royal with staggered, timed entrants like the WWE' annual Royal Rumble match. For the 2017 tournament wrestlers entered every two minutes and could be eliminated by being pinned, forced to submit or thrown over the top rope to the floor. The match came down to Imposible and Super Mega as the last two wrestlers in the match. Imposible ended up pinning Super Mega after a move off the top rope, winning the match and claiming the IWRG Rey del Ring Championship.

Done in oil on canvas, the painting depicts a French cavalryman on a yellow field. The work is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Description  Cavalryman depicts a French dragoon of either the First or Second French Empires. Dragoons were mounted infantry capable of riding into on an engagement on horses before dismounting to engage enemy forces on foot; this important role, coupled with the cost of horses, resulted in dragoons being known as elite-but-expensive troops. Some sources identify the painting subject as a trumpeter. Dragoons became a subject of various works of military art, including the works of Ernest Meissonier, whose style De Neuville directly emulated in A Cavalryman. The painting itself was produced after the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War resulted an upsurge of interest in the military in the French Third Republic. As noted by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, De Neuville \\"capitalized on the intense patriotism and dreams of military glory that the French defeat aroused\\" with his work.

They are named Atlantic Star, Atlantic Sail, Atlantic Sea, Atlantic Sky, and Atlantic Sun. History Atlantic Sail Early design work for a new ConRO design began at International Maritime Advisors, which finished the basic plans in 2008. Knud E. Hansen modified the design to ACL specifications, and in July 2012 the construction contract for five ships was awarded to Hudong-Zhonghua Shipbuilding. Construction began with steel- cutting for the first ship, at the time unnamed, in September 2013. In October 2014, ACL announced the names of the ships in the fleet, having selected them from employee suggestions. The first ship of the class, Atlantic Star, was launched in November 2014 and was planned to enter service in mid-2015, but ACL did not take delivery of the vessel until October 2015 and her maiden voyage did not occur until early 2016. The remaining four ships were delivered over the course of 2016, beginning with Atlantic Sail in April. The entire fleet had originally been planned to enter service in 2015, but construction at the shipyard was delayed due to challenges building to the brand new design. Immediately following their entry into service, problems with the quality of major components license-built in Asia to European designs were identified, requiring drydocking of the vessels for replacement of the faulty parts. Design The G4 class is the largest ConRO design in the world, slightly larger than the preceding 1980s-built G3 class but with significantly more cargo capacity. They are long, with a beam of and a draft of , and have a gross tonnage of 100,430 GT, with a deadweight tonnage of 55, 649 DWT. Each ship is driven by a W√§rtsil√§ RT-flex68D eight-cylinder low speed diesel engine with a power output of that gives a service speed of up to . There are three W√§rtsil√§ thrusters installed for maneuvering, two at the bow and one at the stern. Shipboard power is supplied by a generator driven by the main engine, as well as four Yanmar gensets that have a total of . There are seven decks for roll-on/roll-off (RoRo) cargo, totaling 5,270 lane meters and of space, with a 3,807 TEU container capacity. In contrast to typical ConRO designs, which carry containers abovedecks and RoRo cargo below with the superstructure situated aft, G4 vessels carry exclusively containers at the bow through the entire depth of the hull, with RoRo garage space primarily amidships in and below the superstructure, and containers above decks at the stern, with Ro/Ro space and the machinery belowdecks. This configuration allows for greater cargo capacity, as well as lower ballast requirements. Unusually for cargo vessels, the G4 design does not include a bulbous bow, instead specifying a vertical prow that is more efficient across a wide range of cargo loads and sea conditions.

E. Myers Company, until 1940. At that time, he went to work for SWEPCO as a superintendent and vice president-general manager, remaining with the company until his retirement in 1971. Welsh served as SWEPCO President from 1954 to 1966, and Board Chairman from 1966 to 1971. He also served as president of the Southwest Atomic Energy Associates, as director of the Texas Atomic Energy Research Foundation (a Texas consortium of ten electrical power companies), and as a member of the board of directors of the National Association of Manufacturers, among numerous other roles at regional and national levels in the utilities industry. Welsh and his wife, Marcella, had seven children. One of their sons, John Robert \\"Jack\\" Welsh (1926 - 2005), was a Jesuit priest. Likewise, one of their five daughters, Marietta Welsh (1927 - 2017), was a Roman Catholic nun who served as the Mother Superior of the St. Vincent's convent and as the Superior General of the Daughters of the Cross, the Order which established 21 Catholic schools throughout north Louisiana, including St John Berchmans Catholic [elementary and middle] school and the now defunct all-girl high school St. Vincent's Academy (1868 - 1988), both in Shreveport. From 1969 to 1977, Welsh Sr., served as the first president of the Board of Trustees of Jesuit High School of Shreveport Corporation, which saved the all- male institution, founded in 1902 (now known as the coeducational Loyola College Prep), from closing by providing the necessary financial oversight after the Society of Jesus made the decision to pull out of the school. Welsh's son Jack had earlier attended this institution (as St. John's High School) and returned to teach there (from 1959 to 1976), subsequently serving as President and Rector. J. Robert Welsh was also a Board member of Centenary College of Louisiana. The title of Knight of the Order of St. Gregory the Great, one of the highest papal honors bestowed on a Roman Catholic lay person, was conferred on him in 1956 by Bishop Charles P.

History left Founding It was founded in Havana on March 13, 1916. Established by legislation, the compulsory licensing of these professionals and the Provincial Colleges of Architects were founded, giving way in 1933 to the constitution of the National College of Architects of Cuba. Legal On April 5, 1916, at a meeting held at Tac√≥n Street No. 2, with the presence of the architects Gabriel Rom√°n Casals, Rogelio Santana Fern√°ndez, Jorge Broderman de Vignier and Lorenzo Rodr√≠guez Ubals, the following minutes were drawn up:  Architecture  Colegio Nacional de Arquitectos de Cuba. Floor Plan The circulation of the Colegio Nacional de Arquitectos building is through a double-loaded corridor. It was one of the first curtain walls to be used in Cuba. The building consists of a semi-basement and two floors that houses offices, a library, recreation rooms, an auditorium, and a large spiral staircase that forms a large space on three levels which is illuminated by natural light from three panels of glass blocks. It has several outdoor porches. On the outside, coral stone and green Cuban marble are used. The main part of the building (auditorium) is covered by a gable roof, the rest of the building has a flat roof. Directors In 1928 the board was formed by Esteban Rodr√≠guez Castells who was the first vice president, Emilio de Soto, the second vice president, Miguel √Ångel Moenck served as treasurer and Alberto Camacho was the librarian, artistic director of the magazine and member of the Legal and Advertising Commission. Other members were the architects Joaqu√≠n Weiss, Enrique Luis Varela, Pedro Mart√≠nez Incl√°n and P√©rez Benitoa, who was a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Between 1950 and 1961, they occupied the presidency, Rene Echarte Mazorra, Pedro Guerra Segu√≠, Agust√≠n Sorhegui V√°zquez, Vicente J. Salles Burell, Horacio Navarrete Serrano and Rodulfo Ibarra P√©rez. Decree-Law No. 3174 The Colegio Nacional de Arquitectos de Cuba emerged as a result of Decree-Law No. 3174 of the Ministry of Public Works on December 13, 1933. The Colegio had six provincial headquarters throughout the country. The law established that all work built in the country should have the approval of the school.

As of December 31, 1958, there were 676 architects licensed and registered in the National College of which 590 were in the Provincial College of Havana. In 1924, proposals were requested and the project was awarded to Architect C√©sar Guerra. In 1926 the building was finished, however soon thereafter it was discovered that the building was too small to include many of the required functions. In 1945 proposals were once again accepted for the enlargement of the existing building. The new building by architects Esquiroz and Zarraga resulted in a total reconstruction of the existing building. Other organizations In 1932 the Federation of Architects of Cuba was created, which grouped the professionals who began to practice outside of Havana, until the 1950s had about 90% of architects based in the capital.

The first recorded grammatical treatise in the Ga and Fante languages was written by Protten and published in Copenhagen in 1764.  Early life   Ancestry and family  Christian Jacob Protten was born on 15 September 1715 in Christiansborg, Gold Coast, now known as the suburb of Osu, Accra in Ghana. His Danish father, Jacob Protten, alias \\"Prot\\", \\"Prodt\\", \\"Prott,\\" was a soldier stationed with the garrison at the Christiansborg Castle in Osu. His Ga mother of Togolese ancestry, was a princess and the daughter of a chief or king, Nii Ofori Ashangmo, the ruler of the Ga state from 1660 to 1680. Historical records list his mother's name simply by her initials, \\"N. N\\". Protten had two older siblings: a brother, Wilhelm or Friderich Protten (born 28 April 1709) and a sister, Anna Protten (born 2 February 1713), both raised in Christiansborg. Archival records indicate that Christian Protten's maternal uncle, Ashangmo, also Foli Bebe or Ofori Bembeneen was a coastal chieftain in the former Portuguese slave market of Little Popo (An√©ho) in modern-day Togo, and ruled the Guin/Ge State there from 1694 to 1727 or 1731/33. After the passing of Ashangmo, his son, Assiongbon Dandjin became the new ruler at Aneho sometime between 1731/33 and 1737. Christian Protten appears to have been a candidate for succession but only matrilineally.  Education  Christian Protten's early education was at the Danish language-Christiansborg Castle School for mulattoes, where he was tutored by a Lutheran minister. Within the confines of the fort, Protten was introduced to Christianity and mastered the Danish language. In 1726, at the age of 11, he was chosen by his teachers and sent to Copenhagen, Denmark, together with another Euro-African pupil, Friederich Pedersen. Protten recalled that the decision to send him to a school in Denmark was against his will. His mother's family was also against this development. On the day of his departure, as he was rowed out to the waiting ship, his relatives stood on the beach, hoping the canoe would capsize and Protten would return to safety on the shore. At the age of 12, King Frederick IV of Denmark (reigned 1699‚Äì1730) took interest in his welfare and became his godfather at his baptism on 27 November 1727. After his baptism, he assumed the name Christian Jacob Protten. Protten then enrolled in a trade apprenticeship to become a blacksmith. Initially, he was disheartened to partake in the vocational training as he desired a more academic education. In 1732, he finally matriculated at the University of Copenhagen where he studied theology, completing his studies in 1735 at the age of twenty.  Work   Teaching and Christian mission  Christian Jacob Protten In 1735, Christian Protten met Nikolaus Ludwig, Reichsgraf von Zinzendorf und Pottendorf (1700‚Äì60), the Bishop of the Moravian Church, at the Danish court. Shortly thereafter, he became acquainted with the Moravian fellowship and moved to Herrnhut, the Moravian colony at Berthelsdorf, which later became Saxony, staying there for the next twelve months and learning German along the way. Also in 1735, Frederick Pedersen Svane, a Ga- Danish Euro-African from Christiansborg (Osu) graduated in the arts and philosophy from the University of Copenhagen, befriended a Moravian, Carl Adolph von Plessen. Together with his Danish bride, Svane sailed to the Gold Coast as an independent missionary. Protten was deeply unhappy in Germany, noting in his diary that Europeans described him as ‚Äúafrikanisch wild‚Äù (African savage) and ‚Äúmohrisch‚Äù (Moorish). In 1737, Christian Protten, along with Moravia native, Henry Huckoff, sailed from Amsterdam, the Netherlands to the Gold Coast to begin a new life as Moravian missionaries. Commenting on Protten's perceived conceitedness, Zinzendorf wrote, \\"Protten has a high opinion of himself. Presumptiveness and a high opinion of oneself only prostitute a person and carry no weight with the Saviour.‚Äù He was alleged to have been prone to fits of uncontrollable anger. Prior his departure to the Gold Coast, Count Zinzendorf instructed, \\"Dear Christian: In order to convert the Moors, you must leave all your Moorish bad habits in Amsterdam\\". Despite these negative remarks before his departure, Protten was nonetheless tasked with establishing a school for Euro- African children in Elmina. The ship docked at Elmina on 11 May 1737. Henry Huckuff passed away, presumably from fever, a month after their arrival. This new situation resulted in a change in plans for Protten who ended up visiting his mother in Little Popo/An√©ho, Togo. According to the Gold Coast historian and Basel Mission pastor, Carl Christian Reindorf, Protten visited his relatives at An√©ho in September 1737. He was reportedly kept there against his will and only returned to Osu in 1739. His plans to start a school at Elmina were thwarted by the Dutch Governor at the time, Martinus Fran√ßois de Bordes who viewed Protten as a Danish spy and detained him for three years until 1740. de Bordes died in office on 16 March 1740. The political situation at the time was unfavourable as the Dutch had waged a war against the Dahomey. During Protten's imprisonment in Elmina, he was infected with malaria. Upon his release, he served as an educator for a year. In 1741, upon the receipt of a letter of invitation from von Zinzendorf, Christian Protten returned to Herrnhut, after failing to win converts on the Gold Coast. In 1743, he sailed to the island of Saint Thomas in the West Indies as an independent missionary. While in the Caribbean, he remained detached from other missionaries there. He returned to Germany in 1745 with the aim of going back to the Gold Coast. However, the Moravian leaders were not in favour of that proposal, although homesick Protten was desperate to return to his homeland. He therefore remained in the Moravian communities for the next decade. There were constant tensions between Zinzendorf and Protten due to the latter's alcoholism and alleged haughtiness. In 1756, Protten and his wife, Rebecca were banished from the Moravian commune in Herrnhut to the village of Gro√ühennersdorf in the G√∂rlitz district. He received permission to return to West Africa, leaving his wife, who rejoined the religious community at Herrnhut. In 1757, he received his commission from the Royal Chartered Danish West India and Guinea Company to become a teacher and a preacher at his alma mater, the Christiansborg Castle School. As the vessel approached the West African coast, it landed on the Grain Coast (now Liberia) where he stayed for almost four months. He arrived in Christiansborg in June 1757 and reconnected with his family. He returned to Europe in July 1761, arriving in Herrnhut in 1762; he reunited with his wife and the other Moravians. This particular journey occurred after the death of a Euro-African pupil, who Protten had accidentally shot while cleaning his rifle at the castle. Christian Protten was briefly imprisoned for this incident. In 1765, he returned to the Gold Coast with his wife, Rebecca. With the blessing of the Moravian church, he became the schoolmaster of the castle school until his death in 1769. Earlier in 1764, he had submitted a proposal to the Danish Crown, King Frederick V of Denmark (reigned 1746‚Äì66), to establish a boarding school at Christiansborg which would include a curriculum in indigenous languages, highlighting the importance he attached to literacy in his mother tongue. Historians have concluded that his mission education initiatives on the Gold Coast were essentially failed projects. His last years in Christiansborg seem to have been troubled. In the final decades of the 18th century, several other Moravian missionaries who were sent from Europe did not survive beyond the first few months due to tropical afflictions, particularly malaria and yellow fever.  Foray into linguistics  In 1764, Christian Jacob Protten wrote his magnum opus, \\"En nyttig Grammaticalsk Indledelse til Tvende hidintil gandske ubekiendte Sprog, Fanteisk og Acraisk,\\" an introductory treatise to the grammar of the Ga and Fante languages which was published in Copenhagen. Seen as his greatest achievement, the text acted as a trilingual (Danish, Fante, Ga) catechesis manual for European missionaries who yearned to learn the two Ghanaian native languages. Furthermore, Protten translated Martin Luther's Smaller Catechism into the Fante and Ga languages.  Selected writings  * Protten, Christian Jacob (1764), \\"En nyttig Grammaticalsk Indledelse til Tvende hidintil gandske ubekiendte Sprog, Fanteisk og Acraisk,\\" Copenhagen [A Useful Grammatical Introduction to the Ga and Fante languages]  Personal life  Rebecca Freundlich Protten On 6 June 1746, he married Rebecca Freundlich (1718‚Äì1780) in Herrnhut, Germany. Freundlich was also known as \\"Shelly\\", a mulatress and a former slave from the Caribbean who was the widow of a Moravian missionary, Matth√§us Freundlich (c. 1681-c. 1742). Rebecca Freundlich was born on the island of Antigua in Antigua and Barbuda. Rebecca Freundlich had an arranged marriage to Matthaus Freundlich. They were married on 4 May 1738. The Freundlichs were persecuted and imprisoned for their Christian faith while they were sharing the Gospel to slaves in Saint Thomas. Rebecca Freundlich had a daughter, Anna Maria Freundlich, from her first marriage, who was born circa 1740, on the island of Saint Thomas, now the US Virgin Islands. Anna Freundlich died in 1744, aged 4 years, in Germany. The Freundlich family had travelled to Germany due to Matthaus Freundlich's ill-health. He however died during the voyage across Germany. In 1750, Christian and Rebecca Protten had a daughter, Anna Maria Protten who died in infancy in Herrnhut, Dresden in Sachsen, Germany.  Death and legacy  Christian Jacob Protten died in 1769 in Christiansborg, Accra, leaving his wife, Rebecca, widowed for a second time. She had not fully acclimatised to the Gold Coast and the Moravian missionaries contemplated sending her back to Saint Thomas. As she was in poor health, it was decided she remained on the Gold Coast, where she eventually died in 1780, aged 62 years. The appendix to Protten's booklet was the first published grammar of an indigenous language of the Gold Coast. His linguistic work in the Ga language predated that of the German philologist and Basel missionary, Johannes Zimmermann (1825‚Äì1876) by a century. Zimmerman also translated the entire Bible into the Ga language. In effect, his grammatical output was an example for both Zimmermann and the Basel Mission pastor and historian, Carl Christian Reindorf (1834‚Äì1917), whose literary masterpiece, The History of the Gold Coast and Asante was written in the Ga and English languages and published in 1895 in Basel. Moreover, as a mulatto or an Atlantic Creole, Protten was able to hone his linguistic talents and abilities by blending his African upbringing and his European education, through a spatial awareness of the missionary settings he lived in during the 1700s.

It was founded by Dr. Leslie Field in 2008, and is based in Menlo Park, California. The organization was previously known as Ice911.  Solution  The Arctic Ice Project's approach is to spread hollow silica microspheres (reflective sand) on top of ice in the Arctic. The microspheres raise the reflecting power of polar ice. This reduces the amount of sunlight absorbed, and slows the melting of the ice. The microspheres are bright white, and each one is 35 microns in diameter (less than the diameter of a human hair). The microspheres are filled with air and they float. The vision is to cover a strategic area of the Arctic about the size of Belgium with microspheres. Target locations will be near communities that depend on the ice, and routes through which melting ice reaches the wider ocean. The Arctic Ice Project aims to rebuild a natural system with the least possible intervention. The Arctic Ice Project's silica microspheres will dissolve over time. This is a form of ‚Äúsoft geoengineering‚Äù. It is claimed to be less damaging and more reversible than other techniques. Some scientists are concerned about the risks of restoring Arctic ice, as this approach could have unintended consequences. The Arctic Ice Project maintains that its approach will not drastically alter the ecosystem or pollute the environment.  Testing and Deployment  Since 2008, the Arctic Ice Project has tested various materials that might provide a protective barrier to the sea ice. Tests were first conducted in laboratories, on a pond in Minnesota, and on lakes in California and Canada. In 2015, the Arctic Ice Project set up its first trial site above the Arctic Circle. In Utqiaƒ°vik, Alaska in 2017 and 2018, the Arctic Ice Project developed and successfully tested an automated deployment method for covering the ice.

He has performed stand-up, written comedy, and acted in sketches and shows, who is known for his frequent collaborations with All India Bakchod. Career Chakraborty gained online popularity, in 2012, for operating a Chetan Bhagat troll account called @SatanBhagat on Twitter. He started performing stand-up comedy across India. He was briefly employed as HuffPost India's Trends Editor, for three months in 2015 and later on went on to work as a staff writer at All India Bakchod (AIB.) He has since written for television shows and performed sketches with contemporary Indian comedians. As an actor, and performer, he was known for his frequent collaborations with All India Bakchod (AIB) on comedy sketches and branded content. Between 2016 and 2018, Chakraborty acted in numerous projects that included branded content, reality television, and comedy sketches. He acted in Behti Naak (running nose), a dark-comedy YouTube series (created by Sumukhi Suresh,) and was a recurring cast member in the first two seasons of, mockumentary web-series, Better Life Foundation. During the first half of 2017 he worked as a writer on the second season of Son of Abish‚ÄîAbish Matthew's YouTube talk show. The following year, Chakraborty was a participant on TLC's comedy reality-TV show (Queens Vs Kings) in April, and Comedy Central India's Impractical Jokers spinoff (Challenge Accepted). He also hosted a YouTube segment for VICE about Indian Men's Rights Activists. In October 2018, a number of unverified allegations of sexual impropriety surfaced on Twitter claiming Chakraborty had allegedly sent unsolicited explicit messages to multiple women. Chakraborty initially apologized for his transgressions, then remained inactive for about a year. In November, 2019, a leaked call recording between him and one of the prime accusers surfaced in which Chakraborty challenged the authenticity of the allegations and claimed the unverified allegations effectively destroyed his career, maligned his reputation and made him suicidal.  Style  Chakraborty's stand up is in nature, a comedic style he cultivated since operating @SatanBhagat. He leveraged his online fame into open-mic spots and writing gigs for comedy sketches and television. He has since won multiple open mics and gigged across India.  Controversy  In October 2018, fellow comedian Mahima Khukhreja tweeted accusing Utsav of sending her a dick pic, followed by screenshots of anonymous messages accusing him of attempting to harass a younger girl. Utsav later said that he never harassed her, and that she was only a year younger at 26 years of age Chakraborty initially apologized and his actions prompted an apology from All India Bakchod (AIB). AIB apologized for continuing to work with him after Tanmay Bhat, the chief executive officer at the time, had received \\"specific, detailed allegations\\" of sexual harassment against Chakraborty prior to the public call-out. Eight months later, aided by a separate allegation against a co-founder surfaced, AIB fired its staff, and halted production of its YouTube channel, after a majority of brands decided to not work with them.  Consequences  As a result of allegations of sexual misconduct against him, All India Bakchod delisted the videos he worked on from their YouTube channel. AIB's show, On Air With AIB, was cancelled in its third season (compounded by allegations against another co-founder) and some of his work from Queens Vs Kings has also been removed from YouTube, while other projects he worked on remain online. One year later, in October 2019, Chakraborty said he has few friends left and would like to be in therapy but couldn't afford it because he is not working. \\"I haven‚Äôt worked or seen a paycheck since last October,\\" he said. He admitted his past behavior was \\"problematic\\" and realized he made people \\"uncomfortable,\\" which took a heavy toll on him. He said the media was irresponsible by exaggerating the accounts relating to his case without any verification or investigations into the allegation. Aftermath On 21 November 2019, a year after the initial allegations of sexual impropriety, an audio clip of a conversation between Chakraborty, Kukreja and her sister was uploaded to YouTube. The conversation, broken into two uploads, happened one month after the initial allegations were made public. In it, Chakraborty can be heard listening to Kukreja and her sister, who identified herself as a lawyer, threatening him with legal action as Chakraborty planned to provide evidence that would disprove her accounts of the incident. On the same day, in a flurry of tweets, Utsav claimed that all of the earlier allegations were false, stating that the instagram conversations had been leaked without the alleged victim's consent, and with one half of the conversation which showed her consenting deleted. This was confirmed by said accuser, who then apologised to Utsav before deleting her account.Sirur, Simrin (22 November 2019) - Year after #MeToo apology, comic Utsav Chakraborty calls out 4 women on Twitter for ‚Äòlies‚Äô ThePrint. Utsav also asserted, using screenshots, that the girl purported to be 'much younger' than him was only an year younger at 26 years of age, and that he never harassed her. Chakraborty claimed Kukreja didn't verify any allegations of impropriety sent to her. In response to claims of malicious intent against her, Kukreja penned a statement in Firstpost calling Chaktraborty's claims a, \\"planned and orchestrated PR-led campaign [that] has been led to malign me Kukreja, the women who spoke up, and the #MeToo movement itself.\\" She said the leaked audio and screenshots of their previous chats were misleading, false, and claimed the audio was doctored.

It has been described as possibly the largest money laundering scandal ever in Europe, and as possibly the largest in world history. It includes incoming funds from Estonia (23%), Russia (23%), Latvia (12%), Cyprus (9%), UK (4%) and others (30%, more than 150 countries each of which account for a smaller part than the UK). Outgoing funds were distributed between Estonia (15%), Latvia (14%), China (7%), Switzerland (6%), Turkey (6%) and others (52%)  Financial supervision  Danske Bank, headquartered in Copenhagen, is the largest bank in Denmark. The bank's local branch in Estonia, which was acquired by Danske Bank as part of a merger with Finnish Sampo Bank in 2007, was used for the activities. It was under the jurisdiction of both the Financial Supervisory Authority of Denmark (due to the location of the headquarters) and the Financial Supervisory Authority of Estonia (due to the location of the branch), and both have blamed the other side for deficiencies.https://www.dfsa.dk/~/media/Nyhedscenter/2019/Report_on_the_Danish_FSAs_supervision_of_Danske- Bank_as_regards_the_Estonia_case-pdf.pdf?la=en The Danish and the Estonian supervisory authorities later released a joint press release on collaborating and sharing information on the case. Both were allegedly criticized in a draft prepared by the European Banking Authority, an EU banking watchdog controlled by the national financial supervisory authorities of EU members states. However, the EBA closed its investigation early and did not publish the findings ‚Äì a decision that itself caused criticism.  Events  In 2007, the Estonian Financial Supervision Authority came out with a critical report on the Danske Bank's activities. One of the Magnitsky's stolen Hermitage Capital Management subsidiaries, Diron Trade LLP which had a Great Britain postal box, assisted in $5.8 billion in money laundering transfers between Swedbank's Baltic subsidiaries and Danske Bank during 6 months in 2010 and 2011 according to SVT. During that time, Aivars Bergers, a board member of Latvia's leading pro-Russian party Harmony and one of its largest financiers, received EUR 270,000 from Diron Trade LLP and Murova Systems LLP, a company which has a Great Britain postal box and is associated with the Azerbaijani Laundromat in which $2.9 billion was money laundered through Danske Bank's Estonia branch. In 2013, the first whistleblower disclosed that Danske's branch in Tallinn was knowingly dealing with funds from the family of the Russian President Vladimir Putin (his cousin Igor Putin) and the Russian security service (FSB). The claims were not properly looked into and hence did not catch enough attention. The local Estonian branch of Danske Bank, after being acquired in 2007, still used its own IT-system and many documents were written in Estonian or Russian. Despite these difference in systems and language, the Danske Bank did not implement changes that would make it easier to control for the headquarters in Denmark. In a 2018 report released by Bruun&Hjejle;, a law firm retained by Danske Bank, the bank claimed to have had believed for a \\"long time\\" that the high risks represented by non-resident customers were mitigated by proper Anti-Money-Laundering procedures. It had become clear that the AML procedures were not sufficient after being tipped off by an internal whistleblower. The whistleblower was later identified as Howard Wilkinson, former head of trading for Danske Bank in Estonia, Latvia & Lithuania. According to the Danish FSA, non-resident portfolios from Russia in 2012 made up 35% of the profits of the local branch. The overall percentage of Russian clients in the branch was 8%. Some of these transaction have been linked to the Russian Government and were done via shell companies that were registered in the United Kingdom, Cyprus and New Zealand, as well as other banks in Latvia and Moldova. The second highest amount of non-resident portfolios were from the United Kingdom. Another significant non-resident portfolio has been linked to the President of Azerbaijan and his family. In 2013, US bank JPMorgan Chase halted its services to the Estonian branch of the bank, suspecting it was laundering large amounts of Russian money. Other banks continued providing services into 2015. In 2014, The Estonian Financial Supervision Authority found \\"large-scale, long-lasting systemic violations of anti-money laundering rules\\" in the Estonian branch of Danske Bank and notified the Danish authorities on the findings. According to the Estonian Financial Supervision Authority, the activities decreased after they requested the bank to target the violations. According to the Danish FSA, a critical report sent by the Estonian FSA was discussed at the bank's board meeting on October 7, 2014. The conclusions of the report were \\"toned down\\" in the minuted discussions of the Executive Board. According to the report, during a meeting in June 2014, the bank's board members \\"were interested in the branch‚Äôs earnings, while the minutes have not recorded any comments on the significant AML challenges.\\"https://danskebank.com/-/media/danske-bank- com/pdf/investor-relations/fsa-statements/fsa-decision-re-danske- bank-3-may-2018.pdf?rev=47d2a3f36ea54a27a4a06315617e48e3&hash;=6FF0797DF9CCBCD211BD1D0578406123 A former executive of the Estonian branch of Danske Bank was found dead on September 25th, 2019. Estonian police discovered the body of , who was in charge of the branch from 2007 until 2015, during a search operation after his disappearance that began two days earlier. Rehe was a key witness in the ongoing criminal investigation. The cause of his death has been reported as suicide. Results Ten former employees in the local branch of the bank were arrested by Estonian authorities in December 2018, and the bank was required by the Estonian government to close its Estonian branch in 2019. The CEO Thomas Borgen resigned in 2018 following the scandal. Danish authorities charged him in May, 2019 with neglecting his responsibilities. At the same time, Danish prosecutors charged Henrik Ramlau-Hansen, the bank's former finance director, with failing to prevent the suspicious transactions. The Danish Parliament increased penalties for money laundering eight-fold, making them some of the toughest in Europe. Danske Bank shares fell by half in half in 2018. The bank has said it will donate 1.5 billion kroner ( US$225 million) to a charity. It expects to pay fines of several billion dollars to financial regulators in Denmark, the U.S. and other European countries.

It is characterized by a confirmed viral load above 400 copies / ml after 24 weeks or above 50 copies / ml after 48 weeks of treatment or, even for individuals who have reached complete viral suppression, by confirmed rebound of viral load above 400 copies / ml. After the institution of antiretroviral treatment, basically three aspects of the evolution can characterize failure or therapeutic success: the evolution of viral load, T-CD4 + lymphocyte count and the occurrence of clinical events. The progressive decline in T-CD4 + lymphocyte counts is characterized by immunologic failure. It should be considered, however, that there is a wide biological variability (individual and interindividual) in the counts of these cells, as well as laboratory variability related to the technical reproducibility of the test. There is also circadian variation of CD4 levels and therefore it is recommended that the sample for the test be obtained in the morning. Variability related to the various motifs described above may result in oscillations of up to 25% in absolute CD4 T-lymphocyte counts, with no clinical significance. It is therefore recommended that reductions greater than 25% in T-CD4 + lymphocyte counts are suspected of immunological failure and confirmation is given.

This reaction to the MeToo movement started in October 2018 after a tweet from a mother about her son being afraid to date because of a climate of false rape allegations. It rose to greater prominence during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings. The #HimToo movement is seen as a response to the sexual assault allegations from the #MeToo movement.  History  The meaning of the #HimToo hashtag has constantly changed throughout the course of its existence. When it was first used before 2015, #HimToo had no political meaning attached to it. It was simply an acknowledgement to the participation or presence of a male in an activity. #HimToo first began to carry a political connotation in 2016, although it was still not used for issues regarding rape allegations or gender related issues. Instead, it was a way of showing support for Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs running-mate in the 2016 United States presidential election. During that time period, the hashtag #ImWithHer referred to Clinton, while #HimToo was connected to Kaine. Eventually, Donald Trump‚Äôs supporters used the same hashtag #HimToo to criticize Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, using #LockHerUp followed by #HimToo. Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee (video from Voice of America) #HimToo became connected with rape allegations following the emergence of the #MeToo movement when a mother in the United States tweeted about her son with the #HimToo hashtag. She claimed that her son, Pieter Hanson, was afraid to go on dates because of false rape allegations. Hanson himself disavowed his mother‚Äôs tweet, saying that he does not avoid dating for fear of being falsely accused of sexual misconduct, he never has and never will support #HimToo, and that he supports the #MeToo movement. However, the hashtag became increasingly popular for criticizing rape allegations, especially after actress Asia Argento, one of the major leaders of the #MeToo movement, was accused of sexually assaulting men. During the Brett Kavanaugh hearings, the #HimToo hashtag was re-popularized in defense of Kavanaugh. People used the #HimToo hashtag to express support for Kavanaugh and to criticize women who allegedly gave false rape accusations. The hashtag then evolved and became more generally used to defend men against false rape accusations. #HimToo became the anti-thesis to #MeToo as a call for fairness towards men during sexual assault hearings by asserting that men should not be implied as guilty before sexual assault hearings begin.  #HimToo rally  On November 17, 2018, a rally supporting the #HimToo movement hosted by Patriot Prayer member Haley Adams was held in downtown Portland, Oregon. According to Adams, she and about 40 others gathered to show support for men who are victims of false rape allegations, which they blame the rise of the #MeToo movement for. The speakers shared stories of false rape accusations and spoke about other points regardings \\"Men's Rights.\\" Joey Gibson, the leader of the Patriot Prayer movement was present in the #HimToo rally. Many of those who attended as well as those who spoke are associated with Gibson and the Patriot Prayer group. A counter-protest attended by 350 people was held nearby to express their support for victims of sexual assault in light of the #MeToo movement under a banner saying \\"Survivors are Everywhere.\\" Among the attendees were various different left wing groups including antifascists dressed in \\"black bloc\\" outfits and members of the Portland Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). After the rally held by the right wing group, a larger number of anti-fascist protestors from the left wing rally chased them. The protesters allegedly started using pepper spray and fireworks, as well as tossing bottles, flares, silly string, and smoke bombs. The police then placed a protective wall around the right wingers who were left. The opposing rallies ended in six arrests.  Alternative views  Although the Him Too movement remains largely associated with highlighting the false rape allegations that men have faced, some argue the movement has been used in other ways. During the rise of the Me Too movement, the Him Too movement began to take on a new meaning of supporting men who have been victims of sexual harassment and violence themselves.https://www.npr.org/2018/10/11/656293787/-himtoo-left-and-right- embrace-opposing-takes-on-same-hashtag.  Criticism  Criticism of the Him Too movement primarily focuses on how it misrepresents the frequency of false sexual assault allegations. Critics also claim that the HimToo movement discourages men who do deal with sexual abuse from coming forward because HimToo creates a gender line where men are the accused and women make the accusations. They state that HimToo movement discredits the idea that men can be sexually assaulted as well, and casts doubt that those who come forward can be believed.

It is to be found on the seabed in shallow water in the Pacific Ocean. Description G. repens is orange in colour and grows to an unstretched length of about . It is cylindrical in shape with bluntly tapering ends. Proboscis worms are known for their eversible proboscises, but in most species these are unbranched and cylindrical, or may have a sharp, venomous stylet part way to the tip. In a few instances, they are branched but the side branches are short and the proboscis resembles a feather. In the case of G. repens, the proboscis is a densely branching structure giving the impression of a cloud of mucus secretion. Distribution and habitat G. repens is native to the Pacific Ocean where it is found in shallow water on the seabed, living on the surface or tunnelling through soft sediment. Ecology Proboscis worms in general are predatory, snaring or spearing their prey. At first, zoologists were unclear precisely how this species fed; the branched proboscis resembles the feeding tentacles of sea cucumbers in the family Synaptidae, which feed by sifting through sediment, and might have the same function; alternatively, the proboscis might function like the cirri in the oral hood of the lion nudibranch (Melibe leonina) which feeds by filtering zooplankton out of the water. It is now accepted that the branched proboscis is shot out like a sticky harpoon and snares animals such as molluscs and other worms. It is then reeled in, dragging the prey back to the mouth, where it is swallowed whole. The proboscis is also used defensively if the proboscis worm is stressed.

History The origins of Wins Finance as a publicly listed company start with Sino Mercury Acquisition Corporation (SMAC), which was formed as a special-purpose acquisition company. SMAC had been established and listed on the Nasdaq in 2014. The intention of forming the shell company was to raise money and serve as a backdoor for a Chinese company in the non-traditional financial sector to become listed in the US. The founders of SMAC were Richard Xu and Brad Reifler. The sole book runner on the IPO was Cantor Fitzgerald. SMAC's August 2014 IPO on the Nasdaq would raise $40 million. Wins Finance was the target Chinese company acquired by SMAC in 2015 with the merged entity taking the name of Wins Finance. It would start trading on the Nasdaq in October 2015. The main subsidiary of Wins Finance is Shanxi Dongsheng Finance Guarantee, which was founded in 2006, but the leasing business started in 2009. Soaring stock price in 2017 In early 2017, the company's stock generated widespread media interest because it had soared by as much as 4,555% since its Nasdaq listing. At its peak in February 2017, the company had a market capitalization of $9 billion and its largest then shareholder Wang Hong was worth $6 billion. A Bloomberg investigation into the price spike summed it up as \\"a little-known Chinese stock that went crazy for no apparent reason\\". Corporate affairs Wang Hong was in 2016 the largest shareholder, holding 67% of shares. By the end of the year, Wang Hong entered into an agreement to sell his shares to Hong Kong Stock Exchange listed Freeman FinTech at a 79% discount to the trading price of Wins Financial on the day of the agreement. Wins Financial was in the midst of a meteoric ascent. The deal would be completed in August 2017 with Freeman FinTech paying $260 million for Wang Hong's shares. Other major shareholders in mid-2016 were Zhao Peilin and Zhao Jing. Connections to Deyu Agriculture Key players in SMAC and Wins Finance also have connections to Deyu Agriculture, a Shanxi based company like Wins Finance, that had also been listed on the Nasdaq in 2010. Deyu Agriculture's US listing had ended with the collapse of the stock price. Jianming Hao served as the chairman and co-chief executive officer Wins Finance and had also been the CEO of Deyu Agriculture. The largest shareholder of Wins Finance, Wang Hong, was also a top shareholder of Deyu Agriculture. Wang Hong was CEO of Deyu Agriculture after Jiaming Hao stepped down as CEO in 2013. Peiling He was both the CFO of Deyu Agriculture and later Wins Finance. Business The company provides financial services including loan guarantees, equipment leases, and direct loans to small and medium sized businesses in Shanxi. About 2/3 of its business is in Jinzhong, a 4th tier city economically reliant on coal mining in Shanxi. In the fiscal year ending in June 2017, the company's loan guarantee business fell by half to $2.8 million with a limited client base of only 2 customers accounting for 1/3 of the revenue.

SWAP was designed to record Solar Wind en route, at, and beyond Pluto. At Pluto, SWAP was designed to record the potential nature between the solar wind and ions and/or material entering space from the atmosphere of Pluto.  Background  The atmosphere of Pluto was discovered in 1988, but it remained enigmatic and it was hard to understand an atmosphere existing in such low temperatures (45 Kelvin (‚Äì380¬∞ Fahrenheit)). One of the ideas about Pluto is atmospheric loss, with Pluto being compared to losses from comets. The idea of atmospheric loss was suggested in 1980, even before the atmosphere was discovered. One idea is the photoionization of escaping neutral particles might alter the flow solar wind around the dwarf planet. The atmosphere was known to be very tenuous compared to Earth, and one of the questions was how the gases were interacting with the solar wind and sunlight, likewise weaker at Pluto's orbit than at Earth's. One of the ideas was that Pluto's atmosphere would be stripped away by the solar wind over time. Kelly Beatty - Pluto‚Äôs Atmosphere Confounds Researchers (March 25, 2016) - Sky & Telescope Magazine By the 2010s, only three other spacecraft besides New Horizons have collected extensive data about the solar wind beyond 10 AU, Voyager 2, Pioneer 10, and Pioneer 11. Overview SWAP is designed to be able to detect the sparse solar wind concentration at 32 AU, which is about three orders of magnitude less than near Earth (1 AU). However, at that distance the flow of the Solar Wind is still supersonic, and thus liable to create a bow shock around an obstacle. One of the areas of investigation is the relationship between high altitude atmospheric loss and the solar wind. After the July 2015 flyby of Pluto by New Horizons, data from SWAP was used to study the nature of Pluto's interaction with the solar wind. It was determined that NH entered a Plutopause and passed through a heavy ion tail. Earlier in the mission SWAP was intended to observe the Solar Wind around Jupiter. SWAP was also designed to be used in conjunction with PEPPSI and REX, to study how the solar wind changes with greater distance from the Sun. SWAP took only limited observations before 2012, but after that took a greater amount of data. Starting in 2012, while the rest of the spacecraft was in hibernation most of the time, SWAP was turned on to collect data about the Solar wind as it journeyed out to Pluto at 33 AU. SWAP recorded data about solar wind in the outer solar system and beyond Pluto, and some of the data that is sought about the solar wind are the proton density, speed, and temperature. One of the observations made with SWAP was that Pluto's interaction region on sunward was limited to an area of 6 Pluto radii (about 7000 kilometers); this was smaller than expected. Design SWAP mounted to New Horizons spacecraft SWAP is a top-hat electrostatic analyzer. SWAP has a barrier known as the Retarding Potential Analyzer (RPA) that can be open or shut depending on the conditions. When closed ions must pass through the RPA before reaching the inner detectors. Beyond the orbit of Jupiter, it was not necessary to have the RPA engaged for measurements to protect the sensors from being overloaded. The RPA can protect the sensors from being overloaded by solar wind intensities that are too strong, as the device is also required to measure much fainter solar wind fluxes at 33 AU from Sun where Pluto would be at the time of the flyby, and even beyond. SWAP can detect ions up to 6.5 kiloelectron volts (keV). SWAP weighs 3.3 kilograms (7.3 pounds) and uses an average of 2.3 watts of spacecraft electrical power. Overall swap is designed to study the solar wind, including at the distant of 32 AU, and to study atmospheric loss from the atmosphere of Pluto.

In 1904, she founded her own legal agency, the Kvinnliga Juridiska Byr√•n ('Women's Legal Bureau') in Stockholm. She thereby became the first woman in Sweden to start a legal agency, run by a woman, and with primarily female clients.

Cheng and based on the novel We Are Panic by Mian Mian. It is considered part of the dGeneration, having been shot on digital video, and is experimental in style.  Synopsis  Shanghai Panic follows the lives of four friends in Shanghai in the early 2000s. They are part of the post-70s generation, twenty-somethings born after the one-child policy was introduced in China. They spend their time taking legal highs and dealing with various self-inflicted traumas. Very little happens in the film, with many scenes consisting of lengthy conversations over cigarettes. Major plot points revolve around Bei, who at the beginning of the film mistakenly believes he is HIV positive, and then later decides to pursue a romantic relationship with his friend Jie, despite the fact they are both straight. Cheng describes the panic of the title as \\"individual search for identity,\\" and asserts that the lack of love experienced by his characters is symptomatic of Shanghai's materialist culture. This disconnect leads to them to a 'curious niche between potential and actuality, a crack in between promises for the future down which many find themselves falling.'  Production  Cheng filled most production roles, including camera and editor. Many of the scenes were improvised, with the director saying that the cast 'play themselves.' Cheng has described his film as docu-drama, although Jamie Tweedie argues that it deviates from the documentary principle of locating its characters within a specific location and history.  Reception  Shanghai Panic screened at various international festivals, including San Francisco Lesbian & Gay Film Festival, Beijing Queer Film Festival, Film Fest Gent and Berlin International Film Festival. Cheng won the Dragon and Tigers Award at Vancouver International Film Festival.  References  External links * 2001 films ","title":"Shanghai Panic"},{"id":"58752844","text":"Nicholas D.

It is noted for its alvars and large dolomite pavements., ground flat by glaciers. It also contains grykes and ecologically significant wetlands.  History  Misery Bay is a young landscape. The area was covered by the Laurentide Ice Sheet 20,000 years ago. It was only exposed 10,000 years ago, with most of the area being inundated with glacial lake water 4,000 years later. The land has been slowly rising since then as it is no longer weighed down by the glacier. The land surrounding Misery Bay was privately owned, purchased by the Sifferd family in 1959. They recognised its significance and worked to protect it. A visitor's centre was built in 1982, and the land donated to Ontario Parks in 1989.

Rooke has exhibited his \\"Brutalist\\" ceramics Brutalist architecture: a concept made concrete FT https://www.ft.com/content/4dcac1fe- be25-11e2-9b27-00144feab7de and painting both in the UK and abroad with work in many collections both public and private including the Victoria and Albert Museum, Cleveland Museum of Art, Nuffield Foundation, Paisley Museum and Art Galleries, Leicester Museum, Buckinghamshire County Museum, R√∂hsska Museum in Sweden and the Trondheim Kunstmuseum in Norway. His work has become sought after at auction houses in the UK and USA.  Early years  Bernard Rooke attended Ipswich School of Art studying painting and lithography before going on to study at Goldsmiths College of Art. It was while studying here that he decided to take up pottery. Although unfamiliar with this craft and tradition, he found that working with clay provided new opportunities for freedom of interpretation and creativity.  Forest Hill studio  In 1960, Rooke set up his first pottery in Forest Hill in South London along with Alan Wallwork. It was a very small room with enough space for a small electric kiln. He was initially using mainly hand building, coiling, blocking and slabbing techniques. While researching ideas, he was supporting himself by part-time lecturing at London University, Goldsmiths College and St Mary's College. In addition, Rooke's membership of 'The Craftsman Potters' Association' enabled him to show his work in a shop in Carnaby Street in London.  The Old Mill, Swilland in Suffolk  In 1967, both the need for a larger working space and becoming disillusioned with living in London spurred Rooke into moving out of the city and to an old mill building in Swilland in Suffolk.http://www.suffolkmills.org.uk/newsletters/047%20January%201990.pdf Rooke wanted to widen the range of work so as to become more commercial. With the birth of his son, Aaron, and much needed work to be done on the mill, it was important to be able to make a living. In 1968, the Grand Metropolitan Hotel commissioned Rooke to make 120 standard lamps, 120 table lamps as well as a 24 foot long ceramic mural and another 9 foot high, which incorporated interior lighting. The money from the commission helped to pay for much needed restoration work on the mill. By the 1970s, a gallery space was opened in the windmill and run by Susan Rooke, Bernard's wife, selling work to locals and tourists as well as to American airmen based nearby. The vision for Mill Gallery was beginning to develop and alongside this a reputation was building bringing in a good source of income.  Later years  Sons Aaron and Felix were becoming more involved with the running of the pottery, giving Bernard more time to develop new ideas and designs and more time to continue with his painting. In 2004, the Rooke family decided not to sell to the public through the gallery anymore and close the pottery to concentrate more on painting and printmaking. In 2017 Bernard's lighting was featured in the Exhibition: ‚ÄúGlass, Light, Paint & Clay‚Äù at the Peterborough Museum and Art Gallery. The exhibition featured four artists: Bernard Rooke, John Maltby, Duncan Clarke and Sam Herman selected from the Graham Cooley collection. The catalogue () features an interview with Bernard in which he describes his life and work.

It is said to be one of his \\"most significant sacred works.\\"  History  There are three recorded compositions of Dixit Dominus ‚Äì Psalm 110 in Latin (or Psalm 109 in the Vulgate) ‚Äì by Vivaldi. Each is an extended setting of the vespers psalm for five soloists, choir and orchestra; one only having been identified as his work in 2005. Psalm 110 is regularly included in Vespers services, usually as the opening psalm. Dixit Dominus has been said to be one of his \\"most significant sacred works\\".  RV 594  Vivaldi's best-known setting, catalogued as RV 594, is structured in ten movements, eight psalm verses and two movements for the doxology. It is set for soloists, double choir and orchestra.

This is because they both mutually benefit. From the WBG, Uruguay asks for the development of finance services and innovative knowledge, the use of integrated services with the participation of the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) and the publication of Uruguayan development experiences in web sites where the WBG can serve as a platform for the dissemination of successful reforms. On the other hand, working with Uruguay is interesting for the world bank, because it is a country that is interested in increasing the productivity and insertion in the international sphere plus they are both interested in finding innovative development solution to assist the country and create positive externalities.  Current state of Uruguay  Uruguay has had an annual growth rate of 4.54% between 2003 and 2016, it was reported a high income country by the WB in 2013, and by 2016 extreme poverty almost disappeared, it went from 2.5% of the population to .2%. As of 2017, Uruguay's GDP per capita is US$16,245.6.  WBG projects in Uruguay  The WBG is formed by the IBRD, the IFC and MIGA. As of October 2017, the World bank has invested in 12 projects worth US$1.347 billion, these projects are in areas such as infrastructure, transport agriculture natural resources, education, sanitation and health.  IBRD projects  The IBRD has several different projects happening some of them are for road construction. There are also loans for policy development, which result in the improvement of the country's credit rating, which obtained the Investment grade in 2012.  IFC projects  Since October 2017, the IFC is focusing on infrastructure, the financial sector and the angro-industry, their projects are valued at US$101 million.  MIGA projects  In 2016, the Uruguayan Subsidiary of Banco Santander received a guarantee of US$439 million from the MIGA.  Specific projects   FMD Emergency Recovery Project  In May 2001, Uruguay suffered from a major crisis, that was caused the Foot and Mouth disease (FMD) which affected about 8.3% of the cattle. The livestock sector makes up 6% of the total GDP therefore this affected the economy drastically. The IBRD contributed with the FMD Emergency Recovery Project with US$18.5 Million. The project consisted of treating the livestock with vaccines and training workers and having awareness campaigns, this resulted in the improvement of the sanitary status and the FDM was eradicated from the country. Furthermore, the country's economy was reactivated and it is globally recognized for effective food safety and surveillance. Since 1996 livestock production has grown 124% which proves the success of the project.  Uruguay Water  Although Uruguay's economy is one of the largest in Latin America, it is also pretty small (3 million people), meaning all public utilities are monopolies because once someone is in charge no one wants to be the competition, which would push for reform. Although the country has tried to make progress concerning infrastructure the pipe sewerage is still relatively low compared to Chile, Colombia, and Mexico. This problem has been addressed by the IBRD for the past 2 decades with 3 infrastructure investment loans and it extended one of the Uruguay a Technical Assistance Loan. Thanks to this Uruguay's OSE (the country's public & sanitation utility) has slowly evolved, water treatment supplies have increased from 440,000m^3per day in 1988 to 630,000m^3per day in 2006. Moreover, the IBRD has financed 12300 sewerage connections in 12 cities that cover 60,000 people. And thanks to the IBRD OSE now is part of a system that includes an autonomous water and electricity regulator and a separate policy-making agency.  Energy efficiency  Two decades ago Uruguayans did not care for energy efficiency but in 2004 the Project Energy Efficiency Uruguay promoted using energy in a more efficient way. The WB loaned US$6,8 million for this project. This project changed the way Uruguayans use energy, since part of the project was to educate about energy efficiency.  Results  Uruguay suffered from a crisis in 2001 and 2002 with the contribution of the World Bank Uruguay got out of this crisis. The bank did this by providing Uruguay with lending and non lending services that included measures in areas of tax reform, financial sector and capital market development. The bank made these lendings easier by providing part of this aid in Uruguayan pesos in 2007. Thanks to the collaboration of the bank Uruguay overcame its crisis and achieved macroeconomic stability. Poverty was reduced by nearly 39% between 2003‚Äì09 and of the 3% of the population that lived in extreme poverty went down to 1.3%.

It was created by Catharina Ledoboer and produced by Iginio Straffi and Pierluigi Gazzolo. The series premiered on Rai Gulp in Italy on 15 April 2019, followed by its debut on Nickelodeon Latin America on 6 May 2019. The show follows a student from the 21st century named Eva (Evaluna Montaner) who accidentally travels to the year 1957 with her brother Ruben (Sebasti√°n Silva). After Eva falls in love with an Italian greaser named JJ (Riccardo Frascari), she decides to stay in the past. The show's first season was green-lit after Iginio Straffi held a meeting with other Nickelodeon creatives. Straffi wanted to co-develop another series with Nickelodeon after Winx Club. He watched an unaired pilot episode for Club 57, which was filmed at Viacom's Miami studio in 2016. Straffi took an interest in the concept, and at his direction, the show's male lead (JJ) was written as an Italian immigrant. Series creator Catharina Ledoboer worked closely with the Italian team during all aspects of production in order to suit the program for a European audience. Iginio Straffi brought over many of his former crew members from Winx Club to work on Club 57, including most of the writing staff and design team. The first sixty episodes were recorded over a period of six months, beginning in the Apulia region of Italy in September 2018 and continuing in Miami, Florida. During filming, the cast members studied films from the 1950s in order to accurately represent the time period. Riccardo Frascari, a native Italian speaker, learned the Spanish language for his role as JJ. The series' music was composed by Evaluna Montaner's father, Ricardo Montaner; her brothers, Mau and Ricky Montaner; and her fianc√©, Camilo Echeverry. Club 57 premiered with high ratings, becoming the top-rated program in its time slot on Viacom's Telefe in May 2019. In October 2019, Rainbow SpA's Andrea Graciotti stated that a second season is in development.  Premise  Eva (Evaluna Montaner) and Ruben (Sebasti√°n Silva) are two siblings from the year 2019. After discovering an old time machine in their grandfather's laboratory, they accidentally send themselves back to the year 1957. As they try to find a way to return, Eva and Ruben initially try to stay as unnoticed as possible. Eva soon falls in love with an Italian boy named JJ (Riccardo Frascari), who works as a lighting technician for a popular dance show called Club 57. Eva also becomes friends with the show's lead performer, Amelia (Isabella Castillo), and provokes the ire of JJ's ex-girlfriend, Vero (Carolina Mestrovic). Not wanting to leave JJ, Eva decides to stay longer in the past. Meanwhile, Ruben starts selling his technology to his grandfather (Andr√©s Mercado), who is in his twenties in 1957. Eva and Ruben's presence in 1957 attracts the attention of the Guardians of Time, a group of interdimensional agents monitoring the universe's timeline. They send an apprentice guardian named Aurek (Mart√≠n Barba) and his robotic assistant Droide (Jonathan Quintana) to catch the two siblings and stop their disruptions in the past. Eva and Ruben evade their capture and eventually return to 2019, but there they find that their actions in the past have had a butterfly effect on the present: their parents are no longer together and their grandfather is a spiteful millionaire. Eva and Ruben return to the past to undo their actions and recover their old lives.

At a 2017 meeting, Nickelodeon executives presented Rainbow's founder Iginio Straffi with potential follow-up projects to jointly produce. One was the pilot episode for Club 57, which was produced at Viacom's Miami studio in 2016. Rainbow held discussions with RAI to garner financial support for the show. In December 2017, Nickelodeon officially greenlit the series for a full season of 75 episodes, an order which was later reduced to 60 episodes. At the direction of Rainbow, series creator Catharina Ledoboer rewrote the show's original outline to portray the character JJ as a 1950s Italian immigrant. Nickelodeon's vice president of programming, Tatiana Rodriguez, said in 2018 that this change helped the script have \\"greater depth.\\" Ledoboer stated that \\"from the cast, the writing, all the way to the songs, Rainbow had a very important influence on the series to ensure that their audience would like it, not only in Italy but in the wider European community.\\" The show began filming on 24 September 2018 in the Italian city of Monopoli, Apulia. All of the show's exterior shots were filmed in the city of Martina Franca. Filming continued for six months, moving to Viacom's studio in Miami and involving an international cast of actors from the United States, Latin America, and Italy. Iginio Straffi, who produced the series alongside Pierluigi Gazzolo, commented that the multilingual cast \\"created real friendships... They have real chemistry. That was experiment number one accomplished!\\" In total, over 2,700 minutes of footage were shot across 118 days of filming. After work on the first season wrapped, Iginio Straffi spoke about Rainbow and Nickelodeon's ongoing productions and said, \\"the know-how of Rainbow and the know-how of Nickelodeon are very complementary; the sensibilities of the Americans, with our European touch.\\"  Casting  Actress and singer Evaluna Montaner was cast as the lead character, Eva. During the casting period, Montaner's father received a message from a friend, telling him that the show's lead role seemed fit for his daughter. Montaner's manager recommended that she audition for the character, who was named \\"Luca\\" at the time and renamed Eva after Evaluna got the part. For the show, Montaner sang multiple songs in both Spanish and Italian. Her father, brothers, and fianc√© composed the music, continuing the Montaner family's tradition of creating songs together. Riccardo Frascari, a native Italian, was cast as the show's male lead, JJ. Frascari first learned of the show in May 2018, when he was notified of a new Rainbow project looking for Italian actors who could dance, sing, and speak Spanish. Frascari sent Rainbow a video presentation of him singing a Spanish song, but he could not fluently speak the language at the time. After being cast as JJ, Frascari took an intensive Spanish class to become fluent. With the exception of Evaluna Montaner and Sebasti√°n Silva, most of the show's actors were given a list of 1950s films to study so that their characters would act like those from the time period. The cast members even took courses that covered \\"how they walked in the 50s, how they talked in the 50s, and what they ate.\\" Montaner and Silva, whose characters Eva and Ruben are from the 21st century, were left out of the instruction so that their surprised reactions to the 1950s customs would come more naturally.  Episodes   Reception  When Club 57 was replayed on Viacom's Telefe network, it became the highest-rated program in its timeslot from May to July 2019, reaching an total of 17.8 million viewers. According to data from IBOPE Media, the Nickelodeon broadcast of Club 57 ranked as the top-rated program in Argentina and Mexico among the target audience of viewers aged 4‚Äì11. It also ranked as the second highest-rated series in Brazil and Colombia in the same age group. On the \\"Nick Play\\" mobile application, streams of the first season reached over 1.8 million viewers. On Nickelodeon's YouTube channel, music video clips from Club 57 achieved a combined total of over 30 million views, as of August 2019. At RAI's Pulcinella Awards festival in Positano, Italy, Club 57 was nominated as the best live-action/hybrid TV series of 2019. At the 2019 Kids' Choice Awards Mexico, the series received multiple nominations: Favorite TV Show, Evaluna Montaner as Favorite Actress, and Riccardo Frascari and Sebasti√°n Silva as Favorite Actor.  Related media   Merchandise  In March 2019, Rainbow SpA announced a set of tie-in books based on the show, including a 128-page novel written from Eva's point of view. The books were released in Italy on 10 July 2019. Rainbow also launched a Club 57 magazine in October of the same year.  Live events  At the 2019 Giffoni Film Festival, Rainbow SpA held a \\"Rainbow Day\\" event featuring a performance from Riccardo Frascari as JJ. Then-unaired episodes of Winx Club and Club 57 were screened for the festival's jurors, and Frascari appeared for a question-and- answer session with fans. On 30 November 2019, a live stage musical based on the series opened at the Teatro Gran Rex. It featured most of the television cast and all of the show's original songs. The stage show's plot was described by Billboard as a \\"spin-off\\" taking place after the first season's story.

Early life  He had an older brother, Andrzej, who died at the age of 2. For this reason, Kolanowski's mother often took him to the Mi≈Çostowo cemetery. In primary school, Edmund had to repeat the first, third and fifth grades. Due to his behavior, the doctor directed him to a facility for the mentally ill. Later he continued his education at a vocational school, which he did not finish; nevertheless, he eventually got a job as an electrician. He married to a woman named Zofia in 1970, with whom he had two daughters (born in 1970 and 1972, respectively), but their marriage was annulled at his wife's request in 1975. From 1980, Kolanowski lived with a prostitute named Gabriele, with whom he had one daughter.  Crimes  Since the age of 11, Kolanowski enjoyed watching corpses in the hospital. At the age of 15, he began to accost women in the center of Pozna≈Ñ, for which the juvenile court sentenced him to stay in a youth detention center, but the sentence was suspended for a period of two years. He attempted suicide by shoving a knife in his stomach, but was rescued. In 1966 he was sentenced to one and a half years in prison for beating up an inmate, and left in November 1967. From 1972 onwards, he began to terrorize (kicking, beating, tearing the hair, threatening and wounding with a knife) women at Lake Rusa≈Çka. The militiamen eventually detained him, and the court could prove 3 assaults, sentencing him to 9 years imprisonment. He left prison in 1979, after serving two-thirds of his sentence. Kolanowski later admitted to the following murders: * On October 27, 1970, he murdered and then mutilated 21-year-old Kazimiera G. in the village of Babor√≥wko near the railway station. Her body was never found. * On March 16, 1981, he murdered a 20-year-old woman in Warsaw's Wawer district. * On November 4, 1982, he murdered and mutilated an 11-year-old girl in Naramowice. He also admitted to the following crimes: * desecrating the corpse of a deceased neighbor * in 1972, at the age of 25, he excavated and desecrated corpses * in July 1980, he mutilated the corpses in the cemetery chapel of Nowa S√≥l. * on February 26, 1982, he stole and then mutilated the corpse of a woman from the cemetery chapel in Naramowice * on November 29, 1982, he excavated and desecrated a body from the Mi≈Çostowo cemetery in Pozna≈Ñ. * on January 28, 1983, he excavated and desecrated another body from the Mi≈Çostowo cemetery. He mutilated the corpses by cutting off the breasts and genitals, and would then sew them onto a mannequin for sexual purposes. After a few days, he burned some of the corpses in his furnace.  Arrest, trial and sentence  On May 7, 1983, he managed to escape an ambush set by the militia at the Mi≈Çostowo cemetery, but he lost a piece of paper on the site with the inscription of Pollen ≈Åaskarzew. In the course of the investigation, militiamen reached the Pollen factory and on May 16, 1983 they arrested Kolanowski, who worked there. During the interrogations he admitted to desecrating corpses. A comparison of the murdered girl's blood type (B Rh-) with traces of blood on the suspect's jacket and the testimony of a crossing railway conductor at Naramowice incriminated him, and after four months, Kolanowski admitted to killing her. He went to a psychiatric hospital for observation. Despite assuring that he understood his mistakes by saying \\"Now I think I did wrong\\", he called himself the \\"Cold surgeon\\" in the hospital. On the basis of a three-year investigation, Kolanowski was accused of three murders, five corpse desecrations and the theft of a gold ring. During the trial, which began on January 22, 1985, he canceled his testimony, claiming that it was forced.Events in Poznan in 1985. Part one, in: Kronika Miasta Pozna≈Ñ , No. 3/1986, pp.177, ISSN 0137-3552 Expert doctors ruled that he was not mentally ill while committing his crimes. The Provincial Court in Pozna≈Ñ found Edmund Kolanowski guilty and on June 4, 1985, he was sentenced to death. Kolanowski's lawyer appealed the decision and requested a review of the sentence, but the Supreme Court of Poland upheld the verdict. On July 28, 1986, Kolanowski was hanged in the detention center in Pozna≈Ñ.

The total payload mass was approximately , including the payload adapter.  BepiColombo  BepiColombo had a liftoff mass of approximately . It comprises 3 different elements that will remain attached together during launch and cruise to Mercury: the Mercury Transfer Module (MTM), the Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO), and the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (Mio or MMO). The assembly was accommodated inside the long version of the upper stage fairing. BepiColombo, a joint mission between ESA and JAXA, is Europe's first space mission to Mercury. The European modules (MTM and MPO) were designed and manufactured by Airbus at its Friedrichshafen site in Germany as prime contractor for ESA, heading a consortium of 83 companies from 16 countries. The Japanese module (Mio) was built by ISAS for JAXA. This flight was Airbus's mission, ESA's mission and spacecraft launched by Arianespace, and the latter's deep space mission.  Mission overview   Launch date  The Arianespace launch of took place on at 01:45:28UTC ( 22:45:28 local time) from Ariane Launch Complex No. 3 (ELA 3) in Kourou, French Guiana.  Pre-flight activities  The different parts of the spacecraft arrived in French Guiana between April 24 and May 9. Deployment testing of BepiColombo MTM 2 solar arrays (which will generate up to 11.2 kW of power) were performed at the Guiana Space Centre in the SC5 facilities. The MMO was integrated on the MPO between August 20 and 21. They were both integrated on the MTM between September 19 and 20 to complete BepiColombo. BepiColombo was assembled with its payload adapter on October 4, integrated on the launch vehicle on October 9, and enclosed within the fairing on October 11. The launch readiness review toko place on in Kourou to authorise the start of the final operations.  Orbit  The launch lasted 26 minutes and 47 seconds until separation, placing BepiColombo into a Mercury transfer orbit, escaping the Earth with a hyperbolic escape velocity of about and at an inclination of about -3.8 degrees. It is expected to be captured by and start orbiting Mercury approximately on , after a 7-year travel that will include several flybys of the Earth, Venus, and Mercury itself.

Activism   American Museum of Natural History  Since 2016, Decolonize This Place has organized an Indigenous Peoples Day/Anti- Columbus Day tour of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. Initial demonstrations on October 10, 2016 brought forward a series of demands under the slogan of \\"Rename, Remove, Respect,\\" calling for a renaming of Columbus Day as Indigenous Peoples' Day, removal of the Theodore Roosevelt statue at the museum's entrance, and renovation of several museum exhibitions with the consultation of curators who are representatives of the communities depicted in the exhibitions.Van Broekhoven, Laura N.

In 2019, following the news that the Brazilian- American Chamber of Commerce had rented out space in the museum for a gala to honor Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro, Decolonize This Place issued a statement on Instagram denouncing this use of museum space and promising protests if the event was not canceled.  Brooklyn Museum  Decolonize This Place has organized events on Columbus Day at the Brooklyn Museum. Actions in 2018 around the Brooklyn Museum, both in April and October, have been organized around decolonization in response to the recent hiring of Kristen Windmuller-Luna as consulting curator for African art. An open letter was sent to the Brooklyn Museum from Decolonize This Place criticizing this hiring decision and highlighting it as proof of the disconnect between the museum and its surrounding community.  Whitney Museum  In December 2018, Decolonize This Place organized an action at the Whitney Museum to protest Board vice-chairman Warren Kanders' ownership of Safariland, the manufacturer of tear gas used against members of one of the late 2018 migrant caravans along the US-Mexico border. In response to plans for the 2019 Biennial, Decolonize This Place launched nine weeks of protests beginning March 22, 2019, calling for the removal of Kanders from the museum's Board. After eight artists left the program in solidarity with the protests, Kanders resigned his position on July 25.  Subway protests  In the fall of 2019, the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced a crackdown on fare evasion in the subway, adding 500 NYPD officers to enforce the measure. Decolonize This Place organized a protest in response, focused on the presence of police in New York City subways and calling for free transit in the face of declining service. Around one thousand protesters marched through the streets and later staged a mass fare evasion, jumping turnstiles and holding open emergency gates in several stations in downtown Brooklyn.

Early life and education  Elizabeth Roboz was born in 1904 in Sz√°szv√°ros, Transylvania, Kingdom of Hungary (now OrƒÉ»ôtie, Romania). Her father, a high school teacher and the town's chief rabbi, died in 1914, and her mother moved Elizabeth and her five siblings to Nyiregyh√°za, Hungary. She received a grade of excellent in all five of the Matura examination's subjects but during her last year in high school, the Hungarian parliament restricted the number of Jewish students who could be accepted to the University of Budapest. Recognizing that the restriction could prevent her from getting into the University of Budapest, she instead enrolled at the University of Vienna. She earned a Ph.D. in organic chemistry from the University of Vienna, summa cum laude, in 1928, after which she returned to Hungary where the University of Budapest required her to repeat examinations before confirming her degree. In 1940, she emigrated from Hungary, where antisemitism was on the rise, to the United States through an agricultural specialist's visa. Her family remained in Hungary, where they were impacted by World War II; her mother died during the war and her brother Karl and two of her brothers-in-law were killed by Hungarian Nazis. After the war, her other siblings joined her in the United States with one of them, Edith, sharing her Palo Alto, California home.  Career and research   Career  Roboz-Einstein began her research career as a plant scientist. As an undergraduate student, she studied plant biochemistry in Zellner's laboratory in Vienna. She instituted a plant nutrition laboratory at the Hungarian company Agricultural Industry and represented the company at international scientific conferences. After immigrating to the US, she set up another plant nutrition laboratory, this time at a potato company in Stockton, California. After these early industry positions, Roboz-Einstein transitioned to academia, where her career spanned multiple institutions. The first was the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) which she joined as a research assistant in 1942 and studied Aloe vera with bioorganic chemist Arie Jan Haagen-Smit. She was promoted to research associate, but Caltech did not appoint female professors, so she took a position as associate professor of chemistry at the University of Wyoming in 1945. She remained in this position, while also working at the College of Engineering as a research chemist, until 1948, when she joined Stanford University as a research associate, and worked at Stanford Research Institute's Food Research Laboratory. In 1952, she left Stanford and moved to Georgetown University, where she took a position of associate professor of biochemistry, teaching medical students as well as lecturing at the Veterans Administration hospital. It was at Georgetown that she developed an interest in multiple sclerosis after studying neurochemistry to teach her students. She returned to Stanford University in 1958, (this time as an associate professor of neurology and medical microbiology), where she was selected to head Stanford's new Koshland Laboratory of Neurochemistry. She moved to the University of California, San Francisco's School of Medicine in 1959 to be closer to home, and later moved to the University of California's Berkeley Campus. Much of her work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), for which she was an Investigator for Laboratory of Clinical Science, NIMH (formerly the Clinical Biochemistry Section, Clinical Physiology Section, and Psychosomatic Medicine Branch). She was a member of the American Chemical Society, the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine, and the American Academy of Neurology. In 1957, together with Maynard Cohen and Donald B. Tower, she started a neurochemistry section within the American Academy of Neurology, with the section first meeting at the Boston meeting in 1957.  Research  Roboz-Einstein, as well as Karian Kies at the National Institute of Health's NIMH, identified myelin basic protein (MBP) as being the antigen responsible for inciting the immune response in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model system used to study multiple sclerosis (MS) and other demyelinating diseases. Scientists had known that they could produce an autoimmune response that led to encephalitis and demyelination (degradation of the fatty sheath called myelin that insulates nerve fibers) by injecting animals with nervous tissue, but before then they didn't know what specifically in this tissue was inciting the immune response. Roboz-Einstein and Kies were able to purify MBP and show it caused EAE. This discovery allowed Roboz-Einstein and other scientists to narrow down which specific regions of the protein were antigenic, leading to an improved model system and research on potential immunotherapies for demyelinating diseases. In 1968, she received a $28,405 research grant from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, which Einstein and her colleagues at the University of California, San Francisco, including Dr. Li-pen Chao, used to investigate what made this protein encephalitogenic. She also developed methods to measure levels of immunoglobulin and glycoproteins in components of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and studied how their alteration resulted in disease. From 1961 to 1962, she was a SEATO Scholar at the University of Bangkok, and carried out research at Bangkok's Pasteur Institute involved studying rabies postvaccinal encephalomyelitis. In addition to investigating diseases of the nervous system, she performed research to try to better understand normal nervous system development. At the University of California, San Francisco, she led an investigation of the proteins in neural tissue, particularly those formed during myelinogenesis, and how they change throughout the course of development. At the University of California, Berkeley, she collaborated with colleague Paola S. Timiras to study brain-endocrine interactions. In particular, they looked at the effects of thyroid hormones on the process of myelinogenesis, finding that they influence the onset of the process as well as the composition, and abundance of myelin produced during brain development. This helped lead to hormone replacement therapy for newborns suffering from hypothyroidism.  Personal life  Roboz married Hans Albert Einstein, first son of physicist Albert Einstein, and professor of hydraulic engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, in June 1959. They did not have any children together, although Hans had four children from his first marriage to Frieda Knecht, only two of whom survived into adulthood. Hans died on July 26, 1973, and Roboz wrote a biography of him, Hans Albert Einstein: Reminiscences of his Life and our Life Together (1992). Roboz-Einstein's discovery of myelin basic protein as encephalitogenic piqued the interest of Jonas Salk, who was interested in whether it was involved in multiple sclerosis. He visited Roboz in October 1965 to learn more; they developed a friendship and professional collaboration, exchanging letters for years. Roboz-Einstein also corresponded with microbiologist Esther Lederberg. Her interests included travel, cooking, music, and nature. She died January 9, 1995 at her home in Berkeley, California.

While recovering from injuries during his time in Peru, Schmid met Salvatore Lucia, who suggested to Schmid that he apply to the University of California, San Francisco, where Lucia taught. After completing the UCSF medical internship program, Schmid began his residency and doctoral study at the University of Minnesota Medical School under Cecil Watson and Samuel Schwartz. While pursuing advanced medical studies, Schmid married Sonja Wild in Sacramento, and naturalized as an American citizen in 1954, upon completing his degree. Schmid was a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University, then worked for the National Institutes of Health before joining the Thorndike Memorial Laboratory, a division of the Harvard Medical Unit at Boston City Hospital. He began teaching at the University of Chicago in 1962. Four years later, Schmid joined the UCSF faculty. He was dean of the UCSF School of Medicine from 1983 to 1989. Over the course of his career, Schmid was granted membership into the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine, and the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. He was later honored with the establishment of the Rudi Schmid Distinguished Professorship in Neurology at UCSF. Schmid died of pulmonary failure on 20 October 2007, at home in Kentfield, California, aged 85.

Cross (January 29, 1933 ‚Äì May 2, 2020) was an American ice hockey player and coach who led the Vermont Catamounts of the University of Vermont for nineteen seasons. Playing career Cross graduated from Boston University in 1960, having played ice hockey for the Terriers for two seasons. In his senior year, he helped the team record a third-place finish at the 1960 NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament. While at BU, Cross played collegiate summer baseball with the Dennis Clippers of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Coaching career After graduating from BU, Cross became the director of physical education at Lyman C. Hunt School, a position he held for four years before accepting the head coaching position at nearby Vermont. Cross joined the program in only its third year of existence and took a few years to get the team going in the right direction. In 1970 Cross won his first ECAC 2 tournament title but did not participate in the national tournament because the Division II championship did not start until 1978. After two more good seasons Cross's teams won back-to-back ECAC II titles, and went undefeated in conference play in 1973, earning Cross the Edward Jeremiah Award that year. In 1974 Vermont promoted its program to Division I and was immediately accepted into ECAC Hockey. The Catamounts exceeded general expectation by finishing the season with a 24‚Äì12 record and in third place in the conference. The team also finished third in the ECAC tournament. After this promising start, Vermont declined to middling records for four years before winning an ECAC West divisional title in 1980. The 1979‚Äì80 season was Cross's last winning season, and over his final four years Vermont finished no higher than 12th in the conference. In 1984 Cross resigned, saying, \\"I want to step aside before I get to the burnout stage.\\" Cross remained with the University of Vermont until his retirement in 1994 and two years later was inducted into the University of Vermont Athletic Hall of Fame. He was honored in 2001 with the American Hockey Coaches Association's John MacInnes Award, which \\"recognizes those people who have shown a great concern for amateur hockey and youth programs.\\" In 2019, Cross received the prestigious Hobey Baker Legends of College Hockey Award, and in 2020, he was inducted into the Vermont Sports Hall of Fame.

The track was the second single from their second studio album, Joy as an Act of Resistance. The track was released as a single on 5 June 2018. Considered a pro- immigration track, the track has been described a hybrid of the British pub rock and classic hardcore punk sound, with a modern retrofitting on the European migrant crisis of the 2010s.  Composition  The track is the story of Ukrainian immigrant, Danny Nedelko, who is a close friend of the members of the band and the lead singer of the band Heavy Lungs. The song's lyrics take aim at and are heavily critical of nationalism, while making the focus of the song as a celebration of multiculturalism and diversity. The song celebrates various immigrants from Freddie Mercury to the \\"local Polish butcher\\". Chris DeVille, writing for Stereogum described the track as \\"a bit of righteous post-punk agitprop that morphs into something like a soccer chant along the way, is a tribute to the immigrants that have taken so much heat from nationalists across Europe and America lately\\". Born Music compared the track to contemporary bands such as METZ, Savages and Protomartyr. The website also stated that despite \\"the trademark growls from Joe Talbot are there, and the bouts of guitar feedback and angular riffage are present, this is a much more uplifting song\\".  Critical reception  The song's message, and music video has been well-received by contemporary music critics. Chris DeVille, writing for Stereogum said of the song, \\"Nedelko is a total ham, and his charisma carries the concept to success\\". Rob Hakimian, writing for The 405 praised the lyricism and musicianship, calling \\"Danny Nedelko\\" \\"a rollicking torrent of guitars and chant-along lyricism. This is sure to become a live anthem that will galvanise fans all over the world.\\" Jennifer Buchanan, writing for Indie Shuffle described the song as \\"pure punk rock\\". \\"On ‚ÄúDanny Nedelko,‚Äù Idles shred guitar riffs over lyrics that address the current anti-immigration movement. It is a true song for the people. ‚ÄúDanny Nedelko‚Äù is downright catchy while maintaining Idles‚Äô politically charged roots. The chanting chorus is unapologetically British and reminiscent of Buzzcocks. If there is a Bristol City football player whose name rhymes with ‚ÄúDanny Nedelko‚Äù he should expect to have this sung at him this season\\". Jamie MacMillan, writing for Dork magazine raved the song's message, composition, and believed the track was important in the wake of the migrant crisis. Of the track, MacMillan said that \\"once again, IDLES show themselves to be a band willing to tackle the important subjects and turn it into moshpit gold. We‚Äôve never needed them more.\\"  Live performances  \\"Danny Nedelko\\" made its television appearance on Later... with Jools Holland on 25 September 2018. The performance of \\"Nedelko\\" on Later... was described by DIY magazine as a chaotic and triumphant rendering of the song.  Music video  The music video was directed by the members of Idles. It features Nedelko himself, who spends part of the time parodying Bob Dylan's \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\". Nedelko is wearing a T-shirt that reads, \\"no one is an island\\". Throughout the video, Nedelko poses for photos with immigrants to the United Kingdom, while posting with the \\"OK\\" hand gesture as an attempt to reclaim the gesture back from white nationalists. Alex Gallacher, writing for Folk Radio UK, described it as \\"an uplifting and unifying video\\".

It is the fifth single from their second album, Joy as an Act of Resistance. The track was released as a single for streaming on 2 September 2018 through the band's YouTube channel. Lyrically, the song has been described a critique of toxic masculinity and a rallying cry for men to address the dangers of toxic masculinity and what it really means to be a man. Joe Talbot, the lead singer of the band, has described the song as a critique of masculinity, as well as a personal exposure to his past behavior when he was younger and involved in fights and such scenes.  Background  In 2018, Talbot explained his creative inspiration for the song to NPR: ‚ÄùThis song came about when I said the album needed a knife to cut through the macabre timbre of the album's arch; as soon as I mentioned \\"knife,\\" Bobo [guitarist Mark Bowen] shat the riff out like he knew the album wanted it also. I wanted the song to be an exploration of the horrid corners of my past; the bit I felt shame from. I think of my art as a way of being vulnerable, an exercise in catharsis, and a reflection of my ugliness that can exalt shame. Here it manifested into something beautiful, as all catharsis should be.  Themes and composition  In an interview with Kerrang!, lead singer, Joe Talbot discussed how the song focuses on his personal mental health and toxic masculinity. Specifically, Talbot exposes how the song is a portal to his dark past where the toxic masculine culture he criticizes was a culture he was immersed in earlier on his life, and how he is trying to rid himself of that behavior while acknowledging it happening. Writing for the Leamington Courier Peter Omerod compared the song's sound and composition \\"positioned somewhere between Quentin Crisp, Morrissey and the toilet door of a Wetherspoon's\\". Omerod stated that this song, and the band in general is \\"quite rightly reluctant to be filed under any particular genre: the drums often have a post-punk or motorik intensity; the bass is full, fat and sometimes even funky; the guitars bite and churn; the vocals snarl warmly.\\"  Reception  Reception for the song has been widely positive by contemporary music critics and journalists. Ludovic Hunter-Tilney, writing for The Financial Times praised the song as the \\"right kind of noise\\". Hunter-Tilney described the song as a satire of violence through the critique of masculinity, while describing the violent sounding noise in the track. He described the song as a \\"musical maelstrom aimed to shake up norms, but in the cause of self-growth rather than exhausted rock-and-roll rebellion\\". Olivia White, writing for The Mancunion called the track a \\"fan favourite\\", and described the track as having \\"relentless vitality\\". Thomas Gale, writing for The Oxford Times praised the \\"cathartic noise\\" of the track's introduction before launching into the recognisable, raucous punk they're known for. Omerod also felt the song, especially the song as \\"bright and devastatingly direct. And the lyrics carry a barbed and brutal beauty.\\" Omerod further felt the band's song is \\"potent, powerful, and enormous fun\\". Omerod further said \\"at this point in their career, Idles are so perfect that you might almost want them to retire now. Only that would deny us the possibility of their taking over the world and making everything right. This explosive mix of fierceness, conviction and wit means they can go places others may dare not.\\"  Popular culture  The song is played on the last episode of season 5 of the TV show Peaky Blinders, and also during the fourth episode of season 1 of the Netflix drama series Biohackers. The second verse plays as Oswald Mosley enters a rally at Bingley Hall in Birmingham.

Early life  Cale was born in England in 1958 or 1959 and grew up in the town of Luton, Bedfordshire. He failed out of secondary school. After an unsuccessful attempt to get by as a rock singer in London, he changed his name and moved to New York City in 1979‚Äîa decision that, as he later described in his play We're Only Alive for a Short Amount of Time, was motivated by violent and traumatic experiences in his youth. His early writing began as song lyrics, which he then began to read at poetry readings, until they developed into monologues. Previously, his only experience in theater had been as a stagehand.  Playwright and solo performer  In 1986, Cale made his solo stage debut at New York's PS 122 with The Redthroats, playing a semi-autobiographical character named Stephen Weird; the play won a Bessie Award and was later featured in an HBO special. After touring the play across the country, he brought it to Chicago's Goodman Theatre, beginning a long association with the Goodman, which has presented many of his stage works and commissioned several of them. He followed this the next year with Smooch Music, opening at The Kitchen, featuring a live score by jazz musician Roy Nathanson. Nathanson also composed and performed music for Cale's next play, Deep in a Dream of You, a series of character monologues that Cale described as \\"the first time I've looked outside myself for material and consciously adopted a point of view other than my own onstage.\\" Cale premiered Deep in a Dream of You at the Goodman, where it was nominated for a 1991 Joseph Jefferson Award for New Work; in New York he performed it at The Knitting Factory, where the New York Times called it \\"a significant breakthrough for Mr. Cale\\" with \\"surreal imagery that evokes the connection between passion and dreams with a brilliant clarity,\\" and at The Public Theater, with these two productions collectively winning another Bessie Award. His next collection of character sketches, Somebody Else's House, included pieces that focused on homosexuality more directly than Cale had done before, which he said came from personal experience and an interest in \\"showing people who don't quite fit in with the mainstream gay and lesbian community,\\" as well as a larger theme of \\"people who get overlooked, who are isolated, who might fall between the cracks.\\" One sketch, about a London woman who begins an affair with a younger man, became the basis for Cale's play Lillian, premiering at the Goodman in 1997. Lillian was broadcast on This American Life, and the 1998 New York production at Playwrights Horizons won an Obie Award Special Citation. The San Francisco Chronicle called Lillian \\"Cale's richest and most memorable character.\\" Cale's next two monologue collections, Betwixt (the first time he performed his own work alongside another actor: Cara Seymour) and A Likely Story, premiered in New York in the 2000s. He then returned to the Goodman in 2005 for his first non-monologue production, the musical Floyd and Clea Under the Western Sky, for which he wrote the book and lyrics. Cale acted the lead role, based on a character he had played in the film The Slaughter Rule. Floyd and Clea was negatively reviewed in Chicago, but in New York it was nominated for an Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding New Off-Broadway Musical. Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut commissioned The Blue Album for its 2006‚Äì2007 season as a collaboration between Cale and New York playwright Dael Orlandersmith, with both of them playing a variety of characters that they each wrote for themselves and Cale also contributing songs. Palomino, about an Irish immigrant working as a carriage driver in Central Park who becomes a gigolo, opened in 2010 at the Kansas City Repertory Theatre. Cale had worked as a carriage driver to research a film role. The play also toured the West Coast, to positive reviews. This was followed by The History of Kisses, which premiered at Studio Theatre (Washington, D.C.) in 2011. His solo show Fluffing for Beginners appeared at Dixon Place in 2017. In the same year, he created Harry Clarke‚Äîthe story of a Midwesterner reinventing himself as a British libertine‚Äîas a co-production between New York's Vineyard Theatre and Audible, with Audible also releasing an audiobook of the play; both the stage production and the audiobook were performed by Billy Crudup, a rare case of Cale writing monologue work for another actor. The audiobook also features Cale performing Lillian. Harry Clarke won a Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Solo Show. Cale premiered We're Only Alive for a Short Amount of Time at the Goodman in 2018. He described it as his most directly autobiographical work, depicting his childhood in Luton, and said that he had avoided writing about these experiences earlier because \\"I didn't want people to feel sorry for me.\\" The Chicago Tribune wrote that Cale \\"has been working his whole life toward this one show\\" and called it \\"deeply personal, indisputably courageous, frequently shocking and deeply moving\\". Also in 2018, Cale and musician Matthew Dean Marsh began performing sketches and songs together at New York's Pangea Restaurant under the title More Songs for Charming Strangers, intending to continue this as a \\"monthly concert residency.\\"  Other acting work  As a stage actor, when not performing in his own plays, Cale has mostly worked in New York City. He appeared in Curtains, which received a 1996 Obie Award for the entire acting ensemble. Cale's first screen role was in Woody Allen's Radio Days in 1987. He has since appeared in more than 20 films, as well as TV roles.  Songwriter  Cale's original songs have been recorded by several musicians including The Jazz Passengers, Debbie Harry, and Syd Straw.

It is described by Strabo as situated upon a height near Mount Helicon; its territory was called ŒöŒøœÅœâŒΩŒµŒπŒ±Œ∫ŒÆ. The town stood upon an insulated hill at the entrance of a valley leading southwards to Mt. Helicon, the principal summit of which is seen at the head of the valley. From this hill there was a fine view over the Lake Copais, and at its foot there was a broad plain extending as far as the marshes of the lake. On either side of the hill flowed two streams, one on the eastern or right hand side, called Coralius or Cuarius, and the other on the left, named Phalarus: a tributary of the latter was the Isomantus or Hoplias. Coroneia is said to have been founded by the Boeotians from Arne in Thessaly, after they had been driven out of their original homes by the Thessalians; and they appear to have called it Coroneia after the Thessalian town of this name. At the same time they built in the plain in front of the city a temple of Athena Itonica, also named after the one in Thessaly, and likewise gave to the river which flowed by the temple the name of Cuarius or Curalius, after the Thessalian river. In this temple was held the festival of the Pamboeotia, which was common to all the Boeotians. The Thessalian origin of Coroneia is also attested by Pausanias, who ascribes its foundation, as well as that of Haliartus, to Athamas and his descendants, who came from Thessaly. et seq. Coroneia is mentioned by Homer in the Catalogue of Ships of the Iliad, in conjunction with Haliartus. In historical times several important battles were fought in the plain in front of the town. It was here that in the Battle of Coronea (447 BC) the Athenians under Tolmides were defeated by the Boeotians in 447 BCE, in consequence of which defeat the Athenians lost the sovereignty which they had for some years exercised over Boeotia. The plain of Coroneia was also the scene of the Battle of Coronea (394 BC), which saw a victory gained by the Spartans and their allies under King Agesilaus II over the Thebans and their Argive allies in 394 BCE.Plutarch Ages. 17. In the Third Sacred War, Coroneia was twice taken by the Phocians under Onomarchus. Philip II of Macedon, after the conquest of the Phocians, gave up the town to the Thebans.Dem. de Pac. p. 62, Philip. ii. p. 69. Coroneia espoused the cause both of Philip V of Macedon and of Perseus of Macedon in their wars with the Romans. Pausanias says that the most remarkable objects in Coroneia were altars of Hermes Epimelius and of the winds, and a little below them the temple of Hera. The principal remains of the ancient city are those of the theatre, of the temple of Hera, and of the agora. Coroneia minted its own coins, which are very rare, featuring the Boeotian shield on one side, and on the other a full-faced mask or Gorgonian head, with the epigraph graph KOPO.Dodwell, vol. ii. p. 132, et seq.; Forchhammer, Hellenika, p. 185.

She is currently a professor emeritus in the Department of Psychology and the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior at Cornell University.  Education and career  Adkins-Regan received her B.S. in Psychology from the University of Maryland, College Park in 1967. She earned her Ph.D. in Physiological Psychology from the University of Pennsylvania in 1971. She was one of the first graduate students of Norman T. Adler. Her dissertation research focused on the hormonal control of mating behavior in Japanese quail. After receiving her graduate degree, she was an assistant professor at Bucknell University from 1972-1974 and then at the State University of New York College at Cortland from 1974‚Äì1975. She joined the faculty at Cornell University as an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology and the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior in 1975. She became an associate professor at Cornell in 1981. In 1986, she received a Fulbright Research Scholar Award to work as a visiting scientist at the French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA), where she studied the sexual differentiation of behavior in pigs. She became a full professor in the Department of Psychology and Department of Neurobiology and Behavior at Cornell University in 1988. In 2005, she published the book Hormones and Animal Social Behavior, a major synthesis of the study of animal social behavior and steroid and peptide hormones. She served as the Editor-in-Chief of the journal Hormones and Behavior from 2008-2011 and was the President of the Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology from 2015‚Äì2017.  Research  In her early research using the Japanese quail, Adkins-Regan performed a number of fundamental experiments on the mechanisms of sexual differentiation of behavior in birds, which have a ZW sex determination system. Her work demonstrated that, unlike what is observed in mammalian sexual differentiation, female-typical reproductive behavior can be activated in both male and female Japanese quail by estrogen treatment. She also demonstrated that treatment of male Japanese quail embryos with estrogens de-masculinizes behavior, resulting in adult males that fail to show male-typical courtship behavior even when later treated with testosterone. These experimental findings suggested a model of sexual differentiation for birds in which the steroid hormone estradiol secreted by the heterogametic sex (in this case, females) is responsible for the process of differentiation. Thus, the absence of male-type sexual behavior in adult females would result from their early exposure to endogenous estrogens, a process that would be experimentally reproduced in males by the injection of exogenous estradiol. In the 1980s her research program expanded to include research in both Japanese quail and zebra finches. In the socially-monogamous zebra finches, she performed a series of parallel experiments demonstrating the effects of steroid hormones on the development sexually differentiated behaviors in these songbirds. Adkins- Regan's later research focused on the hormonal and neural mechanisms of a broader range of reproductive and social behaviors in birds, including courtship, mate choice, pair formation, mating behavior, parental behavior and aggression. She also published research in 2016 demonstrating that King quail, a closely related species to the Japanese quail, form monogamous pair bonds.  Hormones and Animal Social Behavior  On 7 August 2005, she published Hormones and Animal Social Behavior.

She is most well known for her 1906 book Annuzza la maestrina, a semi-autobiographical work depicting the life of women in Sicily. This work, and other writings of Mancuso, have caused some to consider her ante-litteram feminist.  Biography  Elvira was born in Italy in 1867. She was born into a wealthy family; her father was a noted criminal defense lawyer. Elvira began studying literature as part of her traditional, upper-class education; one of her major inspirations was realist writer Giovanni Verga. Between 1890 and 1891 Elvira wrote several articles for the Florence-base magazine Cornelia under two pseudonyms, Lucia Vermanos and Ruggero Torres. Elveria produced her most famous - and only - novel, Annuzza la maestrina, in 1906, also under a pen name. The semi-autobiographical novel concerned the lives of married women in Sicilian society at the turn of the 20th century. The work was deeply critical of the gender inequality present within Sicilian culture, especially when pertaining to the stigmas surrounding women who chose a career (the protagonist of the novel, much like Mancuso herself, decides to forgo a traditional marriage and become a teacher) over marriage and motherhood. Upon its release, the article was well-received, though it would remain relatively obscure until the late 20th century. Mancuso continued to write after Annuzza, producing several essays related to gender inequality in Italian society. Much of this later criticism was also personally inflected, as it concerned the forced domesticity and rigid lifestyle upper class Sicilian woman were coerced to practice. Elvira also advocated for girls education, though she also lambasted girls primary schools as being only used to train young women for the life Italian society expected them to live.Luigi Capuana, Women's Literature , Catania, 1988, p. 66Elise Magistro, \\"English translation of 'On the condition of the bourgeois woman in Sicily' by Elvira Mancuso (1867-1958)\\", in the Journal of Italian Translation , edited by Luigi Bonaffini, Vol. VIII, N ¬∞ 2 (2013), pp . 78-95 Following the rise of Fascism and the accompanying censorship in Italy, Elvira pursued a career as a schoolteacher.

It is a depiction of the Al-Khazneh temple in the historical city of Petra, Jordan, which Church visited during an extended trip to the Middle East and Europe in 1867 and 1868. He visited the tomb with American missionary D. Stuart Dodge in February 1868 and made sketches there. The painting is located at Olana State Historic Site, the preserved homestead where Church lived in his later years. It may be the last canvas that he painted entirely with his right hand, owing to worsening rheumatoid arthritis. The mausoleum is carved out of sandstone and at the time was only approachable by the depicted passageway, called the Siq. Church composed the painting as he would have first glimpsed the temple; he frames it with the dark rock in a manner that is unconventional for its time. Church found the site \\"astonishing\\" and wrote in his diary of a \\"beautiful temple ... shining as if by its own internal light\\",Raab, 148 which he described as a salmon color. The composition is unlike those of the paintings that had made Church famous; there is no panoramic view, no conveyance of a \\"greater whole\\", and little sense of depth.Raab, 151 The narrow passage has a stream running through it, and the two Bedouin figures at left, barely discernible, provide a sense of scale. Church set out for Petra from Jerusalem with a large entourage of 21 men who provided meals and protection, and got on well with them. The area was popular with artists but considered dangerous; Church reported that an artist had been shot before him. Taking sketches of sacred locales was not necessarily seen as an innocent activity. As Church wrote: The painting was a gift to Church's wife. He designed it, along with its frame, for the sitting room in which it still hangs at the Olana site. Its salmon color is reflected in the interior decoration.

She was born Marylise Ben Ha√Øm in Algiers on October 10, 1928. Early life Her father was a communist who had served in the French army during the October revolution, and her mother was a musician. She was raised in a non-religious household, recalling later that she was seven years old before she realized her family was Jewish. In 1940, the Vichy French regime revoked the 19th century Cr√©mieux Decree, so depriving Jewish Algerians of citizenship and resulting in Ben's expulsion from the lyc√©e she had been attending in Algiers. She briefly attended a Jewish school, but completed her education at home due to her father's opposition to Zionism. Social and political justice Even at a young age, Ben was active in the cause for social justice, particularly combatting poverty among Algeria's indigenous population. At 14 she became the president of the Young Communists. She was also active in the Women's Union, and through the organization's sponsorship became a school teacher in the town of Miliana. She and her fellow teachers instructed the students ‚Äî mostly Muslim and impoverished ‚Äî but also endeavored to raise their political consciousness and promote a decolonized sense of history. Ben supported the anti-French National Liberation Front (FLN) from the beginning of the Algerian War of Independence, and joined the communist Combattants de la Lib√©ration guerrilla group where she helped transport weapons. The French government considered her a criminal and sentenced her, in absentia, to 20 years of hard labor; however, she was never captured and years later would be forgiven. When the war ended in 1962, Ben became a member of the independent Algerian government. Writings Having already been a teacher, a rebel, and a legislator, in 1967 Ben began her artistic career as a poet, short-story writer, novelist, and painter. She published a number of collections of poetry, a collection of short stories (Ainsi naquit un homme; 1982), and a novel (Sabrina; 1986). She was also celebrated for her abstract paintings. France In 1991, as Algeria entered a period of civil war, Ben moved to France. She continued to write and paint until her death in 2001.

Little Beach is a remnant of Short Beach; the northern remnant was encroached upon and attached to Long Beach Island before succumbing to erosion. Geography Short Beach was located southwest of Long Beach Island and northeast of Brigantine Island. History Short Beach first appears as a named feature on the 1777 map of New Jersey by William Faden, where it is labeled as a part of Brigantine Beach called Mihannon Shoal. Short Beach Island and its demise was described in 1878, viz., In time, the northern remnant of Short Beach came to be known as Tucker's Island. The Annual Report of the New Jersey State Geologist for 1905 addressed and described the dynamic of the opening and closing of inlets in the Little Egg Harbor area: A lighthouse was established on Tucker's Island in 1848. Unmanned, this facility was closed in 1860. After the close of the American Civil War, the manned Little Egg Harbor Lighthouse was activated. This remained in operation until 1927, when erosion rendered the structure unsafe. A United States Life-Saving Service station was established on the island in 1856, and was in operation until the early 1930s, when it, too, became unsafe due to erosion. In the late nineteenth century, an attempt was made at the development of a seaside resort known as Sea Haven. Two hotels were constructed, which enjoyed some success for several years until competition from more accessible resorts drew business away. In 1907 another attempt at development, St. Albans by the Sea, was attempted, but was not successful. By the 1920s, Beach Haven Inlet had opened, which once again severed Tucker's Island from Long Beach Island, and increased erosion to an alarming rate. By 1927 the lighthouse was undermined to the point where it had to be abandoned; it collapsed into the ocean on October 12 of that year. The Life Saving station followed in the early 1930s. The island had completely disappeared by 1950. An ephemeral, intertidal island labeled on modern nautical charts as Tucker's Island has emerged in recent years at the approximate former location.

S.) - 11(12) July 1946) was a Belarusian-born pathologist and scientist in Mandatory Palestine. She grew up in a Jewish shtetl in Belarus and during her medical studies at the University of Bern, she became engaged to Chaim Weizmann, who would become the first president of Israel. Together they worked in the Zionist movement. After a four year romance, Weizmann broke off their engagement and Getzowa returned to her medical studies, graduating in 1904. She carried out widely cited research on the thyroid, identifying solid cell nests (SCN) in 1907. Because of her status as a Jew, a woman, and a foreigner, Getzowa's employment status was unstable. She worked through the 1920s in various locations in Switzerland and also briefly in Paris. In 1925, after a recommendation from Albert Einstein, she was hired to work as a pathologist in the yet to be created Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where she would become the first female professor in 1927. She collaborated with a wide range of European scientists over the remainder of her career, before her retirement in 1940. Early life Albert Einstein and Chaim Weizmann (1921) Sophia (also Sonia) Getzowa (Gecova) was born on 23 January 1872 in Belarus, which at the time was part of the Russian Empire. In 1874, her family resided in Svisloch, a shtetl in the Pale of Settlement, near Novogrudok, which was also occasionally noted as her home town. In her own account, Getzowa stated that her parents, Beila Gelfand-Romm of Vilinus and Beiness Getzow (or Beinus Getsov, 1845-1896) of Gomel, moved the family from the rural estate near Svisloch, where she was born, to Vilnius soon after her birth. When she was around four years old, they moved to Gomel, where three years later she began studying with a Jewish scholar and learned the Hebrew alphabet. Getzowa's mother died when she was eight and a cousin, Marie Scheindels-Kagan, who ran a school in ≈†venƒçionys took her in and taught her Russian orthography. She returned to Gomel in 1882 and entered the newly founded Progymnasium, where she studied for three years. For eight years, she then attended the –ñ—ñ–Ω–æ—á—É –≥—ñ–º–Ω–∞–∑—ñ—é –≤ –†–æ–º–Ω–∞—Ö (Women's Gymnasium in Romny), before pursuing medical studies at the University of Bern, in Switzerland, beginning in 1895. Getzowa was active in the Zionist movement and in 1898 was a delegate to the Second Zionist Congress, held in Basel. That year, she became engaged to Chaim Weizmann, who took her to meet his family in Pinsk over the summer breaks in 1898 and 1899. Getzowa traveled to Pinsk on both occasions, with her sister Rebekka, who was also studying medicine in Bern. It is probable that the two lived together after their engagement, as was common at the time. Getzowa became an important member of the Zionist community, attending the 5th Zionist Congress as a delegate of the Democratic Fraction, a radical group formed by her friend Leo Motzkin and Weizmann in 1901. Weizmann, who had been simultaneously carrying on a relationship with his future wife, Vera Khatzman, broke off his four-year engagement with Getzowa in July 1901, but did not tell his family until March 1903. Because Weizmann was vague about his intention, promising to meet Getzowa three months later and encouraging her to continue to work with him in the Zionist movement, she interpreted his relationship with Vera as a flirtation. Having been westernized by his long exposure to European cultures in Germany and Switzerland, Weizmann had now decided on a partner who was less defined by Eastern Jews in the confines of the shtetle. His behavior was seen as dishonorable, and created fractures with Motzkin and others in the Democratic Fraction. His fellow students held mock-court proceedings and ruled that he should uphold his commitment and marry Getzowa, even if he later divorced her. She never recovered from the trauma of the break-up, suffering yet another blow when her sister died from abdominal cancer on 16 April 1902. Encouraged by her professors to continue her studies, she graduated with a medical degree in 1904. In researching her thesis, √úber die Thyreoidea von Kretinen und Idioten (On the Thyroid Glands of Cretins and Idiots), she discovered foreign tissue elements, which would become the foundation of her career. Her observation was that cell rests and cysts of the postbranchial body in atrophic goiters of the thyroid were not formed from thyroid tissue and did not react with the thyroid. Career University of Bern in 1909 In 1905, Getzowa was hired by Professor Hans Strasser as first female assistant at the Bern Institute of Anatomy. She began analysis of goiters and parathyroid tissues and along with Langhans and other of his students was one of the key researchers who clarified the origin of thyroid tumors. She continued with her studies, this time at the Institute of Pathology, under the direction of Theodor Langhans and Ernst Hedinger,. Thanks to her pleasant demeanor, she was popular with her fellow students and colleagues. In 1907, Carl Wegelin was so impressed by her removal of a tumor by abdominal incision that he developed a close professional relationship with her. Wegelin later became the first president of the Swiss Academy of Medicine. That same year, she discovered solid cell nests (SCN), becoming the first to describe them. As Langhans was nearing retirement, he prepared for his departure and both Wegelin and Getzowa were encouraged to apply for the post. Wegelin had habilitated in 1908 and Langhans used Getzowa's research to grant her Habilitation in 1912. Though seven years younger than Getzowa, Wegelin succeeded Langhans as director of the Anatomical institute. and she was appointed as a Privatdozent at the University of Bern. In 1913, Getzowa was appointed first assistant at the Institute and with the beginning of World War I in 1914, she stood in for the director who had been called to military duty. After two years of service, as a woman and a foreigner she was dismissed in October 1915. Without any income, her previous professor Ernst Hedinger offered her a post at the University of Basel in 1916. The position ended after nine months and she became the prosector at the Kantonsspital St. Gallen on a recommendation from Wegelin. Over the next two years, she worked in the pathology clinic where she performed abdominal operations. When the war ended, Getzowa was cut off from friends and family in her former homeland. The Polish‚ÄìSoviet War (1919‚Äì1921) devastated what was left of her home and annexed the land as part of the Second Polish Republic. She returned to Bern, and experienced both emotional and financial difficulties, which did not dissipate until 1921 when the American Putman-Jacoby Foundation arranged for her to work as a freelance researcher at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Given an opportunity to come back to Bern, she returned to work at the Institute in 1924. The following year was awarded special retroactive remuneration for teaching experimental pathology at the university. Hadassah University Hospital, Mount Scopus (c.1934) At the time she left Paris, Getzowa learned of another opening, that of working for the Hadassah Women's Zionist Organization of America in a pathology institute in Eretz Yisrael, but she was unsure of its financial reliability as there was a dispute between the Swiss officials who were providing the chairs for the medical facility and the Palestinian bankers. She sought advice from Albert Einstein and he wrote to the authorities in Jerusalem recommending her and suggesting they offer reasonable, well-defined conditions. Getzowa, reluctantly, also asked Chaim Weizmann for support, as it was he who was involved in founding a Jewish university in Jerusalem. Weizmann replied half a year later, supporting her desire to receive a post of pathologist but explaining administrative structures first needed to be established. Finally matters were sorted out and Getzowa was engaged as a pathological specialist. She set sail on a steamer in the autumn of 1925, having been appointed director of an as yet non-existent pathological institute to be located at the Rothschild Hadassah Hospital. In 1927, Getzowa became the first female professor of Israel, when she was appointed as a lecturer of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. She began working at hospitals in Tel Aviv, undertaking abdominal examinations which in some cases identified tumors in need of removal. The operations upset orthodox Jews who smashed her laboratory windows. In 1931, Getzowa returned to Basel, seeking international support to complete the pathological institute, visiting her European friends, and keeping up with pathological practice. In 1933, the death in Paris of her friend, colleague and financial supporter, Leo Motzkin, caused Getzowa to fall into a deep depression. In 1939, Getzowa returned to Jerusalem, where her pathology center had been completed as an addition to the Hadassah Hospital on Mount Scopus. The administration of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem refused to recognize her as a professor, taking no account of her background in Bern or the 13 years she had already spent working for Palestine. She was offered the chance to obtain a habilitation in Jerusalem but she refused, maintaining it would take years off her career. On 1 February 1939, the university asked for her resignation. Calling on support from international colleagues, Getzowa obtained references for the rector of the university, Abraham Fraenkel, and requests asking him to reconsider her application. Three months later, on 19 February 1940, Fraenkel granted her status as a professor emeritus of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Contribution to research As documented in her 1907 paper titled \\"\\"√úber die Glandula parathyreoidea, intrathyreoideale Zellhaufen derselben und Reste des postbranchialen K√∂rpers\\", Getzowa was the very first to identify Zellhaufen or solid cell nests (SCN). They have long been of interest to pathologists as it is thought they could be behind ectopic structures in thyroid glands or in thyroid tumors. Recent studies have indicated the importance of SCN as they have been found in at least three percent of routinely examined thyroids. Her work in connection with the thyroid also led to research on the relationship between Riedel's struma and remnants of the post-branchial body, such as that conducted by Louise H. Meeker as early as 1924. Credit is specifically given to Getzowa for the detailed descriptions of the ultimo-branchial body in seven individuals she made in her 1905 paper titled \\"√úber die Thyreoidea von Kretinen und Idioten\\". Death and legacy Getzowa died on 11 or 12 July 1946 in Jerusalem, where she was buried in the Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery. In Palestine, she was considered to have been a pioneer in pathology, undertaking autopsies and examinations throughout the country over many years.

Roughly bounded by Calumet Street to the north, Columbia Avenue to the east, Cables Avenue and Tower Road to the south, and Willow an Fisk Streets to the west, it includes the city's finest concentration of turn-of-the century residential architecture, which was developed as its first major planned residential subdivision. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The Overlook residential district was a combination of farmland and country estates of wealthy Waterbury businessmen prior to its development beginning in the late 19th century. In 1897, real estate developer Cornelius Cables began purchasing land in the area, and made a comprehensive plan for residences catering mainly to middle and upper-class families. Columbia Avenue, a boulevard with a grass median, was the central feature of his plans, with three distinct subareas with differing lot and house sizes. Roads were laid out somewhat informally, respecting the hilly terrain. The area was built out by 1930. With The historic district is about in size, and includes nearly 500 historic buildings. About 350 of these are residences, and only five are institutional buildings; the remainder are outbuildings such as garages that date to the period of development. Most of the houses are of wood frame construction, and the majority are Colonial Revival in style. Other period styles are well represented, including the Queen Ann and Craftsman.

As an anarchist social centre, the venue hosted a bookshop, cafe, infoshop, library, meeting space, office space, printing facility, and rehearsal space. Organisations using the space included Food Not Bombs, Anarchist Black Cross prisoner aid chapters, an anarcho-feminist magazine, a squatters aid organisation, and an anarchist queer group. Regular events at 121 Centre included punk concerts, a women's cafe night, and a monthly queer night. The centre kept a low profile and was one of the longest- lasting squats in London. Original occupation 121 Railton Road was first squatted by Olive Morris in 1973. Sabarr Books was established there before moving elsewhere. The centre then became an anarchist social centre. Activities During the 1981 Brixton riots, the centre was left untouched. In 1983, the centre hosted people coming to London for the Stop the City demonstration. The Kate Sharpley Library (KSL) was founded at the 121 in 1979 by, among others, Albert Meltzer. From 1993 onwards, the venue hosted industrial, speedcore, and gabber electronic music events, such as the Sate industrial nights. The social centre was a networking centre for these experimental subgenres. The Dead by Dawn club hosted London's hardest and fastest music between 1994 and 1996. Attendees shared aesthetic interests, including zines, lectures by Sadie Plant, and intellectual literature by the Situationists, Deleuze and Guattari, and William Burroughs. Unlike other club or party series, Dead by Dawn was conceived to be unique in its combination of discussions, videos, films, exhibitions, Internet access, and stalls. The centre was set on fire during a rise in right-wing violence in 1993. Eviction The Lambeth London Borough Council obtained a court order to repossess the building in early 1999. The squatters responded with multiple actions to rally opposition: modifying billboards, wheatpasting protest fliers, publishing the South London Stress, and occupying Lambeth Town Hall with a \\"drink-in\\" protest of a new law against drinking in public. The Evening Standard reported their campaign as \\"highly efficient\\". As the eviction date approached, the squatters barricaded themselves inside and held an all-day street party in April. An armed police force later removed the remaining occupants. Rising property values were a core impetus for the building's repossession.

Its nearest higher peak is Mount Saskatchewan, to the northwest, but they are separated by the Alexandra River. Mount Amery can be seen from the Icefields Parkway north of Saskatchewan Crossing, with optimum photography conditions in the early morning light. Precipitation runoff from Mount Amery drains into tributaries of the Saskatchewan River.  History Mount Amery honors Leo Amery (1873-1955), who was a British politician and journalist who twice visited the Canadian Rockies. Unusually, he (along with Brian Meredith and Edward Feuz Jr.) made the first ascent of the mountain in 1929, after it had been named for him in 1928. Geology Like other mountains in Banff Park, Mount Amery is composed of sedimentary rock laid down from the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Amery is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below -20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below -30 ¬∞C. The months June through August offer the most favorable weather for viewing and climbing this mountain.

The first animal cafe was established in Taiwan in 1998. The concept of this cafe was a cat which is very popular and familiar. Since the cat cafe was established, a number of cafes for various animals have shown up.  History  The first animal cafe was created in Taiwan in 1998 which has the concept of a cat. Although animal cafes originated in Taiwan, they were initially popularized in Japan. One Japanese tourist visited Taiwan and discovered the potential of the animal cafe. Then he came back to Japan and established the first animal cafe in Osaka in 2004. Nowadays, Japan is known as the country which has the most animal cafes in the world. Although there are some countries in Europe and America which also have animal cafes such as Spain, Germany, France, United States, Australia. United Kingdom etc., animal cafes are still more popular in Asian countries yet. When the animal cafe was first created in Taiwan and Japan, it was mainly for people who just want to spend the time with animals. However, there are also several animal cafes for abandoned or lost animals these days as well. Such animal cafes are used as a way to help these abandoned or lost animals by providing them not only home and food but also opportunity to be adopted by customers of the cafe.  Types  As individuals prefer different animals, there are a number of various animal cafes in the world.  Cat cafe  Laika ac Cat Cafe Due to the fact that the first animal cafe was a cat cafe in Taiwan, the cat cafe is one of the most common animal cafes. A cat cafe is like a basic animal cafe that can be found easily especially in Asian countries like South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan. A number of different types of cats can be found at the cat cafe. Normally it separates the play area where people can play with cats and the regular area where people just drink and eat food without cats. Some of the cat cafes create a good interaction between cats and humans. some cat cafes look after and feed cats who were stray cats or abandoned by people. Cat cafes provide those cats home, food and affection. Also, customers who visit a cat cafe regularly and are interested in raising cats can be potential adopters of cats. Cat cafe's staffs try to find a perfect adopter for cats.  Dog cafe  Dog caf√© is another very common animal cafe that can be found easily. People who like dogs would enjoy their time with a number of different kinds of dogs at the dog cafe. Dog cafe is more active, noisy, and filled with motion compared to a cat cafe due to the characteristic of dogs. Like a cat cafe, a dog cafe also provides an adoption system to customers who have the ability to raise them. The dog cafe can be seen as a sanctuary providing a good experience for customers to make a connection with abandoned dogs, and they probably adopt dogs. There is a dog cafe in Los Angeles which has the goal of finding the perfect home for shelter dogs. Customers enjoy the time with dogs and, potentially, become a new owner of shelter dogs. American Eskimo Dog  Raccoon cafe  Raccoon An unusual animal cafe can be found as well such as a raccoon cafe. There is a raccoon cafe in South Korea in which people can play with raccoons while they drink and eat the food. Because this cafe is divided into two rooms, people can choose to play with a raccoon or just enjoy their food and drinks. Because raccoons have such sharp claws and teeth, there is a warning that the cafe is not responsible for any damage from raccoons.  Hedgehog cafe  In 2016, a hedgehog cafe was opened in Tokyo for the first time in the world. Because of the strangeness, many foreigners have visited the cafe. At the same time, some people criticize this cafe from a viewpoint of animal protection.  Sheep cafe  There is a sheep cafe in South Korea which is established in 2011. This cafe is the first sheep cafe in the world which has two sheep named Sugar and Honey. It is allowed to feed them some food. People can watch the sheep as they enjoy their meal. However, sheep cannot stay at the cafe during the summer season due to the weather issue.  Rabbit cafe  Rabbit cafe is located in Japan. Most rabbits are not wandering around like other cats and dogs at cafes but they are often kept in their cages. However, this cafe sometimes provides a chance to walk around a nearby place with rabbits.  Bird cafe  There are a few different kinds of birds cafe in Japan such as owls, parrots, falcons, hawks, etc. They are not dangerous and do not attack people because they are well trained by the staff. The staff shows customers the way they handle and feed the birds in a safe way. Also, people can take a picture with birds if they have permission from the staff.  Reptile cafe  In Cambodia, there is a famous reptile cafe in which people can see a number of different species of reptiles such as turtles, snakes, iguanas, and spiders. People can relax, eat, drink, and learn about a number of different species of reptiles at the cafe. They can also take pictures with a variety of reptiles. The owner opened up this cafe in 2018 with the permission from Cambodia's Ministry of Forestry, Fisheries and Agriculture. He regards the animal welfare as the primary concern at the cafe.  Controversy  There are not a few objections from a viewpoint of animal protection. Some examples are below. „ÉªSome animal experts say that animal cafes might provide some positive effects to animals, but they are more likely to encourage people to buy animals than pay attention to animal welfare. „ÉªSome people argue that the way the animal cafes operate their business is very harmful to animal safety, because some animals are not quite suited for the lifestyle at the cafe. „ÉªSome visitors of animal cafes in Japan express their concerns for the safety and welfare of the birds. „ÉªJapanese animal rights activists also argue that bird cafes abuse birds for the entertainment of humans. As a result, the Japanese government had made much stricter Animal Protection Law which strengths the new rules and restricts trading hours of animal cafes. The stricter regulations are intended to make sure that those animals at the cafes have appropriate human treatment and care. Actually, some cases occurred in the world. The owner of the cat cafe in Thailand was arrested by police due to disobedience against the Animal Protection Law. Seven cats died at his cafe due to the poor safety care. Also, such welfare and safety problem can be found in South Korea as well. For example, animals in the cafes cannot sleep until the cafes shut the door late at night. Such animal safety problems are generated due to the absence of regulations on animal cafes in South Korea because animal cafes are a relatively recent phenomenon. What is more, some customers who have been injured by animals at the cafe have complained about the safety policy when the owners of the cafe do not take any responsibility for injuries.

Her murder was solved in 1989, but she remained unidentified for years following the confession of Robert Leroy Nelson, who was a former Minnesota State Trooper. Busha's remains were identified in 2015 after a DNA profile was obtained following the exhumation of her remains. Disappearance Busha and her sister were raised and homeschooled by their mother and stepfather, who were Jehovah's Witnesses. Consequently, the sisters were \\"highly isolated.\\" Michelle ran away from home when she was 17. She was found by police over 1,000 miles away in Burlington, Colorado, who proceeded to contact her father, Don Busha, Sr. She was later taken to his residence in Bay City, Texas. Busha, described as having a \\"rebellious\\" personality, left home at 18 after an argument with her father while living in Bay City, Texas. Don Busha admitted he slapped her and she made the decision to leave Bay City. She was last seen in December 1979 while she was travelling to Louisiana. She made calls to her family from the states of Mississippi and Indiana, between the months of January and May 1980. After the calls stopped, loved ones feared for her safety. On May 9, 1980, she was reported missing. Michelle's father kept the same phone number and address, hoping she would contact him again. Murder Nelson, while on duty, offered Busha a ride on May 26, 1980 after witnessing her being dropped off by a vehicle near the Bricelyn overpass along Interstate 90. Busha was raped, beaten, tortured and strangled with a ligature. Her fingernails were removed while she was still alive and her head had been shaved, except for an area in the back of the head, which was left about an inch long. After her murder, the body was moved to a ditch along Interstate 90 and her clothing and personal items were removed and disposed of. The decomposed, nude body was discovered about three days to one week after her death. Heavy rains had washed her body into a visible area, where it was discovered by a farmer among broken corn plants.Erickson, David. ‚ÄúRunaway Jane.‚Äù Who Killed Jane Doe?, season 1, episode 6, Investigation Discovery, 4 Apr. 2017. The unidentified victim was estimated to be between the ages of 20 and 35. It appeared she was a transient, as her feet were \\"heavily calloused.\\" She was 5'3\\" and weighed 128 pounds. Her left ear, at least, had been pierced and she had an overbite. Near the scene, bloodied clothing and a Texas driver's license were found. The blood was later found to be that of an animal and the license was counterfeit. The body was later buried in the Riverside Cemetery in Blue Earth in an unmarked grave. Investigation After Busha was reported missing on May 9, 1980, various efforts were made to locate her. In February 1984, a potential match was noticed with a set of remains discovered in New York. In May 1984, her dental records were compared to that of an unidentified woman, known as the Cheerleader in the Trunk, who was discovered in Maryland in 1982. She was excluded as a potential match to both decedents. The unidentified victim's fingerprints and dental records were compared against missing persons from Colorado and Minnesota but did not line up with any of the potential matches. Fliers describing the case were distributed nationally. Henry Lee Lucas confessed to killing a young woman along Interstate 90 in the area, but when questioned in prison during 1983, he gave details inconsistent with the murder and was excluded as a suspect. In June 1988, while in police custody in Smith County, Texas, former Minnesota State Trooper Robert Leroy Nelson confessed to murdering the victim while on duty. He claimed he did not know her name, but she apparently was travelling to Idaho or Oregon and she had spent time in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin area. He admitted to handcuffing her to prevent her escape. Police found his confession credible, as he stated he had removed her fingernails, a fact that had not been released publicly at the time. He pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter, while he was already serving two life sentences. He was sentenced to an additional 86 months on August 25, 1989. Nelson had left Minnesota after becoming involved with a religious cult. Blue Earth resident Deborah Anderson became intrigued by the case in 2002 and made efforts to bring the murder into the public eye. Anderson met with officials and presented a plan to raise funds for the victim's exhumation, which was eventually scheduled for late July of 2014. On August 12, 2014, the body was exhumed for DNA information, which was successfully obtained. The entire process would have cost approximately $10,000, but the exhumation was performed without cost by a local funeral home and construction companies, leaving only the $1,000 cost for the actual DNA testing. In 2004, hairs from the body were examined and a mitochondrial DNA profile (always much less specific than a nuclear DNA profile due to the far lower number of genes contained in mitochondrial DNA) was developed. Authorities had previously taken her dental information and obtained a single fingerprint from the remains to compare against potential matches. Following the exhumation, a new facial reconstruction was created by the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children via an MRI scan. Isotope testing was also performed on a tooth by the Smithsonian Institution to identify regions where the victim may have lived prior to her death. Results from the examination indicated the victim was 17 to 23 years old and was likely white with a possible African admixture. On March 5, 2015, samples obtained from her family in 2007 were matched to her remains. Dental records were compared as well. The body was officially identified on March 13. The remains were then cremated and released to the Busha family on April 9, 2015.

The earliest documented \\"All-Championship\\" show is the EMLL Carnaval de Campeones (\\"Carnival of Champions\\") held on January 13, 1965. In 2007 WWE held a pay-per-view called Vengeance: Night of Champions, making WWE Night of Champions a recurring theme.

Storylines The Caravana de Campeones event featured five professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. For the 2017 Caravana de Campeones show, five out of the nine championships active in IWRG at the time were defended. Pantera I won the IWRG Intercontinental Lightweight Championship on November 13, 2016 when he defeated Diablo Jr. in the finals of a tournament for the vacant championship. His scheduled match against Aram√≠s would be only the second defense in his championship reign. Rel√°mpago had held the IWRG Intercontinental Middleweight Championship since January 22, 2017, after defeating Imposible to win the championship. While he had held the title for days he had only defended the championship once, on Mach 5 where he defeated Apolo Estrada Jr.. The IWRG Intercontinental Welterweight Championship was held by Emperador Azteca at the time, defeating the Argentinean La Mosca on June 18, 2017. Imposible had held the IWRG Rey del Ring Championship after winning it at the 2017 Rey del Ring tournament. He had defended the championship twice before, both against Super Mega, whome he would also face at Caravana de Campeones. The father/son duo of Black Warrior and Warrior Jr. won the IWRG Intercontinental Tag Team Championship from the team of El Diablo Jr. I and Black Terry on September 3, 2017, just two weeks before the Caravana de Campeones show, marking their first championship defense. Mr. Electro had held the IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship since December 18, 2016 but was not slated to put his title on the line for the show. While La Dinast√≠a de la Muerte (\\"The Dynasty of Death\\"; Negro Navarro, Trauma I and Trauma II) had held the IWRG Intercontinental Trios Championship since August 9, 2015 they had not defended it for several months prior to the event and were not booked to defend the championship on September 17, 2017 either. Likewise the current Distrito Federal Trios Champions Los Mariachis Locos (El Hijo del Diablo (5), El Diablo Jr. and Imposible) did not defend on the show either. The reigning IWRG Junior de Juniors Champion, M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr., did not defend the championship, instead he was challenging for the tag team championship at the Caravana de Campeones show.

It was formed from the separation of the two continental plates of Australia and Antarctica about 30 to 40 million years ago. The Tasman Passage connects the Indian Ocean with the Pacific Ocean south of Australia. The term comes from geology. The distance between the two continents is currently about 2,300 kilometers (1,400 miles). Through the opening of the Drake Passage and the Tasmanian Passage, the Antarctic circumpolar current was able to form in the course of the Oligocene, replacing the circumpacial equatorial flow conditions of the Cretaceous. The emergence of the circumpolar current led to a thermal isolation of the Antarctic, since the exchange with equatorial warm waters was greatly reduced. As a result, the ice sheets of Antarctica formed and the Earth entered the Late Cenozoic Ice Age (the current ice age).

Before studying engineering, he worked as a street vendor and grocer during his early life. He also played club soccer for Atl√©tico de Vit√≥ria. Azeredo received his engineering degree from the Federal University of Esp√≠rito Santo. He then moved to Rio de Janeiro, where he studied business administration and computer science at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro from 1968 to 1969. He was hired by the Vale S.A. company (Companhia Vale do Rio Doce) at the invitation of company president . While at Vale S.A., Cunha held the positions of permanent engineer, head of civil engineering, signaling coordinator of the Vit√≥ria a Minas railroad, and head of the company's Intervale S.A. subsidiary. Azeredo founded his own engineering firm, called Engenharia e Estudos Ferrovi√°rios, in 1977. The company eventually expanded to five Brazilian states, as well as an office in London. Political career Azeredo was originally joined the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB), which opposed the military dictatorship, in 1970. However, once other parties were granted limited recognition in 1979, Cunha switched to the new Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB). He worked as the secretary of planning for the municipality of Cariacica during the 1980s, until Esp√≠rito Santo Governor appointed him to his cabinet as state Secretary of Planning and Transport in 1988. During his tenure as Secretary of Planning, Azeredo established the in 1989, which reorganized the public transportation system in the Vit√≥ria metropolitan area.

Design and Construction In 1904 Clyde Steamship & Co. following an increase in their freight business placed an order for two steamers of approximately to serve on their East coast route between Boston and southern ports. Chippewa was the first of these ships, and was laid down at the William Cramp & Sons' Kensington Yard in Philadelphia (yard number 330) and launched on 8 April 1905, with Mrs. Harry W. Hand, wife of the general manager of Cramp Shipbuilding Company being the sponsor. The ship was of the three-deck type, and had all the modern machinery fitted for quick loading and unloading of the cargo, including a large number of derricks. Following an inspection on May 4 and the successful completion of sea trials, the steamer was transferred to her owners and departed for New York on May 20. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a depth of . Chippewa was assessed at and and had deadweight of approximately 4,000. The vessel had a steel hull, and a single 131 nhp triple- expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller, and moved the ship at up to . Operational history Upon delivery Chippewa sailed from Philadelphia for New York on May 20, 1905. After loading, she departed on her maiden voyage on May 24, arriving at Charleston on May 27. The vessel then continued down to Jacksonville to take on more cargo, and left it on May 30 for her return trip. After stops at Brunswick and Charleston, she arrived at Boston on June 5, thus ending her maiden voyage. Chippewa continued serving the same route for the rest of her career, connecting Charleston, Brunswick and Jacksonville with Boston, with occasional stops at Georgetown and Baltimore. The steamer carried a variety of general cargo from the southern ports, mostly lumber, cotton, naval stores and fruit. For example, on January 19, 1907 the ship brought to Boston over 1,200 bales of cotton, nearly 450,000 feet of yellow pine lumber, 2,500 barrels of rosin in addition to other general cargo. On May 30, 1906 while sailing from Jacksonville to Boston, Chippewa encountered schooner Edward P. Avery about forty miles off Winter Quarter Shoal, floating helplessly with both of her main and mizzenmast broken after she was ran down by another schooner, George May. Chippewa took Edward P. Avery in tow and brought her into New York harbor on June 1. Chippewa again came to the rescue, when she picked up six men crew of schooner J.W. Balano, wrecked about forty miles off Frying Pan lightship, and safely brought them to Boston on September 21, 1906. On March 3, 1908 the steamer arrived at Jacksonville, and after loading sailed for her return trip to Boston. Shortly after leaving the port, Chippewa lost her propeller and tail-shaft and had to be towed back into port by her sister-ship Onondaga. She was towed from Jacksonville by another Clyde steamer, Apache, on March 10 but only went as far as Brunswick due to Apache being heavily laden. Chippewa was instead taken in tow by steamer Katahdin, also of Clyde Line, which called at Brunswick on her way up north, and brought her to New York for repairs on March 18. After finalizing her repairs the vessel arrived at Boston on April 3 to resume her regular service. 1908 Grounding Chippewa left Jacksonville on her usual trip on June 19, bound for Boston. She called at Charleston on June 21 and continued sailing north. She was under command of captain Barksdale MacBeth and had a crew of 28 men and carried a cargo of lumber, naval stores and watermelons in addition to some livestock. At around 20:30 on June 23 the ship passed the Shinnecock Light and the soundings were taken indicating depth of about 18 fathoms. The weather was clear the whole trip until about 23:30 when the vessel entered thick fog. At around 23:50 while maintaining her course thought to be paralleling the Long Island's south coast, Chippewa ran aground about three miles west off Montauk Point Lighthouse, and about half a mile east of the Ditch Plains Life Saving Station. As the steamer went ashore she hit a submerged rock making a hole in her bottom. The water rushed in extinguishing her engines which made the vessel helpless. The crew had to wait until the fog lifted before going on shore to request help. Two wrecking tugs were dispatched to their aid, but they could not dislodge the steamer. It became apparent that the only way the ship could be refloated if most of her cargo is removed, and the work commenced almost immediately on lighting the vessel. Some cargo was brought to ports, but the rest, like 60,000 watermelons had to be thrown overboard to the delight of local residents. The lightening work continued uninterrupted until mid-July when most of the cargo was discharged from the ship and an attempt to refloat the steamer was scheduled for July 18. However, the weather which up to this point was very fine, suddenly changed for the worse in the morning of July 18. By noon Chippewa had waves washing over her destroying the temporary accommodations of the captain and the crew that were still aboard the vessel making them to take to the rigging. Their call for help was answered by the head of the local Lifesaving Station and a crew of boarders from a nearby inn. They managed to put a 1,400 feet long line between the ship and the cliffs allowing all the crew to safely reach the shore as the storm raged. Finally, after several more delays due to storms passing through the area, Chippewa was finally refloated on August 4 and towed to New York for repairs. It took a little over a month to finalize the repairs, and the steamer arrived at Boston on September 28 to resume sailing on her regular route. An inquiry was held into grounding in late September 1908 and both captain Macbeth and second officer Googins were reprimanded for inattentive navigation and failure to use sounding machine and had their licences suspended for 30 days. Return to commercial service In 1907 Clyde Line was acquired together with a number of other lines by Charles W. Morse's holding company, Consolidated Steamship Lines, which collapsed in 1908. Several entities including Clyde and Mallory Lines were acquired by the Atlantic, Gulf & West Indies Steamship Lines in 1909 with most of the lines retaining their flags and vessels. Following the grounding incident Chippewa resumed her usual trading activity between Jacksonville, Charleston and Boston, but in July 1909 a new route was added to her travels taking the vessel to Galveston. She departed New York for her new destination on July 20, 1909 and reached it on July 30. There she embarked a cargo consisting of 2,455 sacks of rice, 1,582 sacks of wool, cotton and other general goods and left next day for Boston via Jacksonville. In April 1910 Chippewa was temporarily assigned to the Georgetown-Wilmington-New York route due to an increase in freight volume out of these southern ports. She arrived at Wilmington for the first visit on May 2 but only made two trips before being reallocated to her normal New York-Charleston-Jacksonville route in mid- May. Following the acquisition by AGWI, reorganization took place in summer 1910, with Chippewa temporarily being moved to the newly organized Mallory Line route between Baltimore and Galveston. She left Baltimore in her new capacity on September 9, 1910 with a cargo of 100,000 cases of canned goods and arrived at Galveston on September 17. She returned to Boston on October 3 with a cargo consisting of, among other things, 5,200 bales of cotton. The steamer departed Baltimore for her second trip to Galveston on October 11, carrying a cargo of 106,000 cases of canned goods. The weather was rough throughout her journey, but it turned into a gale on October 15. The vessel continued on her journey, and passed Key West early in the morning of October 17, with the storm getting progressively stronger. At around 09:30 on October 17 Chippewa ran into the center of a hurricane, with the winds increasing in strength and reaching and with barometer dropping down to . The ship was at the storm's mercy for nearly five hours and could be hardly kept under control. By about 14:00 the storm started subsiding, and Chippewa resumed her westerly trip. Surprisingly, the steamer sustained only minor damage, amounting to blown out windows, torn out doors, and shifted cargo, which gave her a port list. The warning was issued on October 15, with most ships taking cover in harbors and ports along the coast, but since Chippewa lacked wireless she was unaware of it and continued sailing and only saw one vessel on her journey, believed to be a Morgan Line freighter (most likely SS Brazos). She managed to safely arrive at Galveston in the evening on October 19 still listing to port. The steamer made one more trip on the route before returning to her regular service from New York and Boston to Charleston and Jacksonville. After leaving Charleston at around 19:00 of October 6, 1912 Chippewa ran into a northeasterly gale about two hours later, with the winds continuously increasing in strength until they reached hurricane strength. The vessel spent 56 hours covering 275 miles between Charleston and Cape Hatteras, and at times could barely steer. Eventually, the storm, which was the tail of another hurricane, turned towards Gulf stream and Chippewa could resume her voyage coming out largely unscathed and safely reaching Boston on October 11. On her next trip she ran aground about ten miles out of Jacksonville on October 20, but was able to refloat herself after several hours and could resume her trip suffering apparently no damage. Following United States occupation of Veracruz in April 1914, it was reported on May 11 that Chippewa along with other vessels was chartered by the War Department for possible use as a transport, however, as the tensions subsided, she was released in June and went back to her regular commercial service sailing between Brunswick and New York, and then Boston and Galveston until the end of the year. On November 9 while berthed in Galveston harbor, she was run ashore by a strong storm and ebb tide that passed through the area, but was refloated in the evening on the same day without suffering any injuries. Early in 1915 she was temporarily put on Philadelphia to Tampa, Port Arthur, Texas City route with the Southern Steamship Company. In May 1915 Chippewa had to make an emergency trip down to Wilmington and transport nearly 1,500,000 feet of lumber to New York due to large freight congestion in that port following the loss of steamer Seminole. Rising prices of sugar during World War I made it very attractive for Clyde Steamship Company to add extra steamers to this lucrative trade, and Chippewa was no exception, making a couple of trips to Dominican Republic and Turks and Caicos Islands in September 1915. The steamer was next put on New York- Wilmington-Georgetown route, which she served until April 1916, before returning to her usual service. 1916 Grounding Chippewa left Jacksonville loaded with cargo of 500,000 feet of lumber, cotton, naval stores, fruits and vegetables on November 4, 1916. The steamer was under command of captain Maguirre and had a crew of 26 men. Shortly after leaving port she ran aground at Dames Point shoal, in the St. John's River and remained stranded for a few hours before being able to refloat herself and proceed to Boston via Charleston. The ship arrived in Buzzard's Bay in view of Cape Cod Canal early in the morning of November 10 during a strong gale and attempted to pick up a pilot to guide her to the port of Boston. However, Metropolitan Line's steamer Henry M. Whitney on passage from New York arrived just a few moments earlier and was able to secure pilot's services. Captain Maguirre attempted to maneuver the ship at the entrance of the canal while awaiting the pilot, and during one of the turns struck a rock about five miles from the canal entrance, off Wing's Neck. The water quickly rushed in flooding her engine room and extinguishing fires. The captain and the crew managed to safely get off the ship, which was in no danger being grounded in only 18 feet of water. Lighters Colonel and Trilby came to her help, bringing divers to assess and repair the damage. Chippewa was successfully refloated on November 16 and was towed to Boston by tugs Juno, Alert and Beckwith on the same day. The steamer's cargo was discharged there before she was placed in the East Boston drydock and it was discovered the vessel had her bottom plates indented or broken over 100 feet length of her hull. Chippewa was subsequently towed to New York for repairs which took around 3 weeks and cost her owner $39,600.00. Captain Maguirre was exonerated of the blame as the charts showed the area his ship ran aground had ample depth and therefore should have been safe to navigate. Last years Following return to service after her grounding accident, the vessel made one trip to Wilmington in December 1916 before being assigned to Mallory Line route to Mobile, Port Eads and other Gulf ports. In October 1917 following United States entry into World War I, Chippewa together with many other vessels over 2,500 tons capacity was requisitioned by the US Government. Under government control, Chippewa continued sailing between New York and Mobile until late October 1918 when she was temporarily put in New York to Tampa service following the loss of steamer San Saba. With World War I coming to an end, Chippewa was put in drydock in New York at the end of 1918 and underwent extensive repairs before returning to her usual route in February 1919 which the vessel worked on until the end of the year. At the end of 1919 USSB allocated several steamers to Clyde Steamship Company to operate on Boston to Jacksonville route, with Chippewa being assigned temporarily to New York-Brunswick service. On March 31, 1920 the vessel left New York for West Indies and after visiting the ports of La Romana and Macoris returned on April 29 with a large cargo of sugar. Chippewa continued her trips to Dominican Republic and Cuba until the end of 1920 when due to overabundance of cargo and scarcity of freight, she was laid up in New York. The steamer was reactivated in April 1923 and through the end of August 1925 continuously sailed between New York, Wilmington and Brunswick. At the end of August 1925, due to embargo imposed by several shipping lines and railroads on Florida there was a huge congestion of cargo in Jacksonville which needed to be moved down to Miami. Originally, it was planned for Chippewa to sail between these two ports, however, due to a strike by port workers in Miami demanding higher wages, the steamer instead brought around 150 stevedores from New York to take over unloading process. At the same time, she was berthed continuously in port through the end of January 1926, serving as temporary housing for New York workers while their permanent quarters were constructed. After serving Clyde Steamship Company for over twenty three years, Chippewa was sold to Union Shipbuilding Company and arrived in Baltimore on October 15, 1928 in tow of wrecking steamer Columbine for breaking at their Fairfield Yard.

The main route extends 22 miles from Lake Needwood in Maryland to the Inlet Bridge in Washington, DC, with a loop in the north part of Rock Creek Park and other trails through the Klingle Valley, Turkey Branch Valley and along the North Branch of Rock Creek. There are three separate trails that make up the main Rock Creek Trail route and others that connect to it. Along the Potomac River from Arlington Memorial Bridge to Rock Creek is a section sometimes called the Shoreline Trail. The trails are some of the oldest recreational trails in the Washington, DC region as parts were built on bridle trails dating back to the early 20th century. They are heavily used for both recreation and transportation. History Physical segments of the trails trace back to bridle trails that utilized several bridges across the creek. These bridges were constructed by the National Park Service (NPS) in Rock Creek Park prior to 1904. Parts of the bridle trail, and several of the bridges, were rebuilt in 1934 after a 1932 flood. The idea of a set of shared-use trails along Rock Creek and the Potomac was born in the 1960s trail movement. In August 1963 the Park Service decided to experiment with ways to make the park more enticing to cyclists and other active recreation, so they closed mile-long Ross Drive to cars from 6 am to noon on Sundays. As part of President Johnson's trail movement, planning for a separate trail system was undertaken by the Department of the Interior in its 1965 \\"Trails for America\\" report which identified a shared-use trail along Rock Creek as one of many trails for the DC area. That same year, the ‚ÄúFort Park System, A Re-evaluation Study of Fort Drive, Washington, D.C.‚Äù report suggested running the Fort Circle Trail through the park. Rock Creek Loop The Rock Creek Loop is a loop trail in the north part of Rock Creek National Park, it runs along Bingham Dr., Beach Dr., Military Road and Oregon Avenue. The 3.2-mile-long trail system includes spurs to Wise Rd. and the Nature Center. The system started in January 1967 when NPS announced a plan to build a trail from Military Road to the District boundary. That trail, the first hiker-biker trail in Rock Creek park, was built in the summer of 1967. The crushed bluestone trail was constructed from the Nature Center, past Wise Road to a turnaround loop just southwest of Beach Drive and the DC boundary. Over the next few months, NPS announced plans to add additional unpaved trails along Military Road from Oregon to Beach, along Wise to Fenwick Branch, beside Fenwick Branch to the District boundary and through Pinehurst Parkway Park (most of which were never constructed). In 1968 they built a second trail along Beach from Joyce to Bingham. By 1969, the two existing northern trails were connected with a trail along Bingham from Oregon to Beach. Later that year, NPS built the final section of the loop along Military between Oregon and Beach. By 1972, NPS had paved all of these trails except the section north of Wise to the DC Boundary. The section along Military Road was originally intended to serve as part of the Fort Circle Trail, passing by Fort DeRussy, but work on the Fort Circle Trail ended in the 1970s with only three parts, the one in Rock Creek, a section of the C&O; Canal towpath and another from Fort Stanton to Fort Mahon, completed. Over time, the Rock Creek section ceased to be viewed as part of the Fort Circle Trail system. Between 1979 and 1981, the unpaved trail and turnaround loop north of Wise was abandoned. As part of a 2016‚Äì2019 project to rebuild Beach Drive, the trail along it was widened to 8‚Äì10 feet, repaved and realigned. Work on the trail section between Joyce and Bingham was completed on September 27, 2019. Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway Trail Aerial view of Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway Trail below the L Street Bridge, at center, 1973 The Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway Trail is a 1.91-mile-long trail from the Inlet Bridge in West Potomac Park to the Smithsonian Zoo. It consists of two pieces, the first ‚Äì the Shoreline Trail or Promenade ‚Äì extending from West Potomac Park at the Inlet Bridge along the DC shore of the Potomac River to Rock Creek, and a second along the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway and Beach Drive to the Zoo Tunnel where it connects to the Rock Creek Park Trail. The first part of the Shoreline section, between Memorial Bridge and Virginia Ave, NW, was constructed in 1964 as part of the Roosevelt Bridge construction. By 1990 it was extended south to the Inlet Bridge. The section between Memorial and Inlet bridges was completed sometime between 1964 and 1979. The Rock Creek Parkway section got its start in 1971 when the Park Service set aside a lane of the Parkway north of Virginia Avenue for a week to promote commuting by bicycle. The experiment was a success at encouraging bike use, but caused traffic jams, so the Park Service paved bridle paths immediately to the west that had existed since the park was founded. This included two bridges, the Lyon's Mill and Saddle Club footbridges, that were built in 1934 and a connection to the C&O; Canal towpath. The section of bridle path used between P and Q streets was built in conjunction with the Pentagon in 1942, as that project needed dirt and the park service needed dirt removed. The trail was extended in September 1971 to Calvert Street, and then two miles to Bluff Bridge in 1972. Beach Drive and the Rock Creek Trail over Rock Creek, 2010 Since its original completion in the 1970s, the trail has been improved and widened many times. * In 1981‚Äì82 the parkway bridge over Rock Creek at L Street was replaced and as part of that project a separate trail bridge was built. The trail bridge replaced a narrow section of the old bridge that had served as part of the bike path. * In 1997, the Shoreline Trail section was repaved and realigned. * In 2007‚Äì08, the Park Service and Federal Highway Administration rehabilitated the Rock Creek Parkway between Virginia Avenue and P Street and at the same time widened and repaved the trail, and installed wooden barriers between the trail and roadway in places. * In 2007, the connection between the trail and the Capital Crescent Trail was improved as part of Phase II of Georgetown Waterfront Park, with several blocks of sidepath constructed south of Water Street. This replaced a temporary connection built in 2000‚Äì01 following the handover of the land from the District to the NPS. * In 2009, as part of phase III of the Georgetown Waterfront Park, the section of the trail between Virginia Ave and F Street was resurfaced, an existing unpaved social trail was paved and the nearby bridge over Rock Creek, connecting the trail to the waterfront, was resurfaced. * In 2018, DDOT built a protected bikeway along Water Street that further connected the Rock Creek Parkway Trail to the Capital Crescent Trail's trailhead. * From 2014 to 19, the Kennedy Center constructed a bridge over the Rock Creek Parkway from the trail to the Kennedy Center, as part of the center's expansion. At some point prior to 2000, NPS constructed a trail connection on Shoreham Hill to Calvert Street, as recommended by the Park Service's 1990 Plan for Paved Recreational Trails of the National Capitol Region (which also recommended adding a new connection at Massachusetts Ave; bypassing the Zoo Tunnel; widening the bridge south of the Zoo; and improving the ramp crossings at P and Pennsylvania) and paved a small parallel trail through Rose Park in Georgetown. In the NPS's 2016 Paved Trails Study for the National Capitol Region, NPS identified several future improvements to the trail. These included widening the trail along Ohio Dr.; removing the stairs on the south side of the Inlet Bridge to extend the trail south; improving the trail at the Belvedere/Constitution Avenue extension; and creating new trail connections at F St NW and to the new bridge planned for near the railroad bridge. As part of a rehabilitation of Beach Drive that started on September 22, 2016, part of the trail was rehabilitated. Much of the trail between Shoreham Drive and the Zoo Tunnel was widened to 8‚Äì10 feet, repaved and realigned; and the Shoreham Drive crossing, reworked in 2006, was again improved. Work was completed on January 8, 2018. In 2018, DDOT announced plans to rehabilitate part of the Parkway Trail from M Street to Shoreham Drive, and to build a new bridge over Rock Creek just south of the Zoo Tunnel. The project also includes a new connection to the Rose Park Trail which will be rehabilitated as well. Rock Creek Park Trail The Rock Creek Park Trail is a 4.33-mile-long trail from the south entrance of the Zoo Tunnel on the Smithsonian Zoo property to Broad Branch Road in Rock Creek Park. The trail through Rock Creek Park was first constructed in 1971 along a bridle path dating back to the early 20th century. After the September 1971 experimental closing of a lane of the Rock Creek Parkway for the use of cyclists showed the interests of bike commuters, NPS paved a parallel bridle path from Bluff Bridge, built in 1934, to P Street, NW. It opened on September 23. These first sections of trail were 4 to 8 feet wide with rough pavement, steep slopes, poor visibility and sharp curves. By 1977, the trail was extended to Broad Branch Road, crossing the creek at Bluff Bridge and twice on newly-constructed \\"breakaway\\" bridges. NPS continued to make small improvements to the trail. In 1982 they built a new bridge across Rock Creek between Pennsylvania Ave and K Street in conjunction with reconstruction of the roadway bridge. Prior to the project, the trail used a narrow section of the existing bridge. That same year one of the two low-water breakaway bridges just south of Pierce Mill that was washed away by Tropical Storm David in 1979 was replaced with a high water bridge.Based on the engraving on the upstream side of the bridge. In 1991 the trail bridge beneath Porter Road, the other low-water breakaway bridge built in the 1970s, was replaced with a high-water bridge. NPS has long sought a way to close the gap between the park trail, the loop and the section in Maryland. Following a 1973 proposal to extend the trail, NPS launched a study and then announced a plan to do so in 1983, but quickly retracted it. In 1980 NPS, inspired by road closures in New York's Central Park, prepared an assessment of alternatives for a Bicycle Trail Study of the park that analyzed nine alternatives including construction of a new bike trail and alteration of the existing road network. After a period of public comment, NPS proposed expanding the weekend closure; constructing an additional 3.5 miles of trail, designating Beach Drive north of Bingham a bicycle route and studying the suitability of a trail in that section. After years of additional study, public hearings and trial closures, NPS announced in February 1983 a plan to expand weekend closures and close Beach between Joyce and Broad Branch to automobile traffic. At first only one lane of Beach would be closed during rush hour, but after Metro's Red Line opened in Montgomery County in 1985, the section would be permanently closed. Six months later, under pressure from the American Automobile Association and the governments of DC and Montgomery County, NPS decided not to close the section of Beach. Instead, they decided to go ahead with the weekend closures and build a bicycle trail along a horse trail between Joyce and Broad Branch by 1986, but that trail was never built.Construction of initial roads, bridle paths and foot paths took place during 1897‚Äì1912. The prospect of completing a bike route across the park re- emerged in the 1990s when the Park was required to come up with a General Management Plan. The 1990 Paved Trails plan recommended completing the trail (as well as increasing the clearance below Klingle Road; widening and repaving the trail; adding new connections at Piney Branch and Blagden; and replacing the low-water crossing at Porter). In 1991, a loosely knit, cyclist-dominated group called \\"Auto-Free DC\\" renewed the push to ban automobile traffic on Beach Drive. They suggested limited road closures to discourage commuters, but allow access to most locations in the park by car. When NPS failed to take up their suggestion, the group led a series of \\"rolling road block\\" protests which aimed to peaceably draw attention to the cause by disrupting rush hour traffic. Nonetheless, the protests led to some confrontations and arrests, and at one point the Military Road Bridge was graffitied with anti-automobile slogans. In 1996 NPS initiated a federally-mandated General Management Plan for the park. In June 1997 NPS laid out several management alternatives, one of which would improve and expand the paved multi-use trails and add a new trail along Wise, with the police substation converted to a visitor center and bicycle rental facility. Another alternative suggested that sections of Beach Drive be permanently closed and converted into a wide multi-use trail and that Wise Road, Sherrill Drive, Bingham Drive, Grant Road, and Blagden Avenue be converted to paved trails. Both of these alternatives were less popular than the status quo. An additional alternative created by the People's Alliance for Rock Creek (PARC), a group consisting of the Washington Area Bicyclists Association, the Sierra Club, Friends of the Earth and 18 other advocacy groups, suggested making Beach Drive auto-free north of Broad Branch as a means of completing the trail envisioned in 1965. In 2003, in an attempt to appease both groups, NPS proposed extending the weekend closures of Beach Drive to weekdays from 9:30 am to 3:30 pm. The proposal was one of several, but was the \\"preferred alternative.\\" The plan had popular support, but no political support. Mayor Anthony Williams who had supported closure as a candidate, opposed it as mayor, citing the need to evacuate in a post-9/11 world. In May 2004, NPS proposed instead to only close the section from Joyce to Broad Branch, but again found opposition among politicians. So, in November 2005, NPS finalized their management plan which included no further road closures, the prospect of lowering speed limits and adding speed bumps, and improvements to the trail south of Broad Branch. However, speed limits were never reduced and no traffic calming was ever implemented. The 2005 District of Columbia Bicycle Plan only called for \\"an improved bicycle connection\\" between Broad Branch and the Maryland line, but, despite this and the Park's management plan, the District's 2013 MoveDC Multi-modal transportation plan proposed a future trail on this section. Completion of the Management Plan cleared the way for NPS and DDOT to rebuild Beach Drive and the trail. Despite planning that started in 2005, work on the project didn't begin until September 22, 2016. The project rebuilt both Beach Drive and the trail. Much of the trail between the Zoo Tunnel and Broad Branch was widened to 8‚Äì10 feet, repaved and realigned; the traffic lanes in the Zoo Tunnel were narrowed to widen the trail through it by 3 feet; a new access to Harvard Street was built and 1000 feet of new trail was constructed between the Porter Street Bridge and Bluff Bridge. In conjunction with the project, the trail through the Klingle Road intersection was redesigned to connect to the new Klingle Valley Trail, built on the washed out section of Klingle Road and opened on June 24, 2017. The work on the trail south of Broad Branch was completed on January 8, 2018. In 2018, DDOT announced plans to rehabilitate and expand the trail within both Rock Creek Park and outside of it. Within Rock Creek Park, they will rehabilitate a section between Klingle Road and Bluff Bridge and a section on the west side of the creek south of Broad Branch Road. They will also build a new trail along Piney Ridge Road from Beach Drive to Arkansas Avenue. Klingle Valley Trail A view of the trail through the Klingle Valley The Klingle Valley Trail is a 0.7-mile-long trail through the Klingle Valley built on the former right-of-way of Klingle Road along Klingle Creek. It connects the remaining portion of Klingle Road west of Rock Creek to the Rock Creek Trail at Porter Street. The road was closed due to water damage in 1990. After two decades of study and conflicting ideas of what to do with road ‚Äì restore it or convert it to a trail ‚Äì the District Council voted in 2008 to convert it to a trail, overruling Mayor Adrian Fenty. Work began in 2015 and was completed in 2017. Rock Creek Stream Valley Trail The Rock Creek Stream Valley Trail in the Rock Creek Manor Neighborhood The Rock Creek Stream Valley Trail is a 14.4-mile-long multi-use trail in Montgomery County, MD from the District boundary to the Lake Needwood Parking lot. It runs through the Rock Creek Stream Valley Park and Rock Creek Regional Park, both purchased and preserved by the National Capital Park Commission starting in the 1920s. A separate trail, the Matthew Henson Trail, follows Turkey Branch Stream, a tributary of Rock Creek, and connects to the Rock Creek Stream Valley Trail. Several other smaller connections have been built to the trail as well. Other connections were planned. The 1978 Montgomery County Master Plan of Bikeways proposed extending the trail along the North Branch of Rock Creek to Olney- Laytonsville Road and west along a tributary to Woodfield Road. Later plans echoed these in part or in whole and included a spur along Needwood Road; connections to a proposed I-270 trail and the ICC trail; and along Crabbs Branch. These proposals were controversial due to environmental concerns and have not been built. Planning for the trail began in the late 1960s and faced strong opposition from the same groups who had opposed extending Beach Drive in 1968. In 1971, the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (MNCPPC) began experimenting with bicycle-only use of sections of Beach Drive on Sundays similar to what the NPS was doing in Rock Creek Park, in order to build support for the trail. Construction began the following year when MNCPPC opened a fly-ash surfaced trail along Beach Drive in Kensington. That first section of trail ran from the Stoneybrook Road, in Rock Creek Stream Valley Unit 2, to Franklin Street, in unit 3. Ridership on the trail was light, so in 1974 they paved the trail. Over the next few years, MNCPPC extended the trail. From 1975‚Äì77 they extended the trail south to East-West Highway and north to Knowles Avenue with four connections to Parkwood, in Rock Creek Stream Valley unit 4, adding another 3.1 miles. By 1978, it was extended to Wexford Drive. By 1980, it went as far south as Meadowbrook Stables, where it became an unpaved trail to Wise Boulevard in DC. In 1979, MNCPPC began work to extend the trail from Veirs Mill north to Baltimore Road, which was completed by 1981. In 1980, MNCPPC built a connection to Linthicum Street and Edwin Broome Middle School. Between 1981 and 1985, the trail section between Wexford Drive and Veirs Mill Road - which replaced a planned extension of Beach Drive north of Garrett Park Road - was constructed. They built two other connections to the east side, at Puller and Clearbrook, in 1984. Between 1985 and 1989 the trail was extended north to Lake Needwood. It was extended 1.2 miles south from East-West Highway to the District boundary by 1998. Even before the trail was completed, the county began making numerous new connections to the trail. In 1980 the county, with help from NIH and the federal government, built a trail along Elmhirst Parkway to connect the NIH hospitals to the trail. In 1981, the planning board authorized three new connections to the section of trail between Veirs Mill and Baltimore Roads; one to Oriental Street, one to Russett Street and one to Greenspan Lane at Drake Drive Park. None of these were constructed until sometime between 1994 and 2009. In 1987, the National Capitol Planning Commission approved connections to Weymouth Road, Saul Road and along Beach and Grovesnor to Wisconsin Ave, but only the latter two were built. The connection to Weymouth had faced opposition from residents of Bethesda's Parkside Condominiums since it was first proposed in 1983, and had to be rerouted to avoid wetlands, but despite the rerouting it was never built. In 2008, developers of the old National Park Seminary constructed trail connections from Ament Street and Stephen Sitter Avenue to the \\"Ireland Trail\\", which predated the Rock Creek Stream Valley Trail and connected the Seminary to the Creek via Ireland Creek. On July 23, 2011 Montgomery County Parks and the Maryland State Highway Administration opened the $5.8 million trail bridge over Veirs Mill that had been in planning since at least 2004. In the same year they completed the Ceder Lane Bridge reconstruction project, which included a trail connection between the Stream Valley Trail and the Bethesda Trolley Trail via the Elmhirst Parkway Trail. In 2016 the County started work on the Twinbrook Connector, a 4500 foot long connector trail between the trail near Veirs Mill Road and Rock Creek Mill Road, but ran out of funding before completing it. They plan to complete it in the future. From the opening of the Georgetown Branch Trail in 1997 to the completion of the Rock Creek Trestle in 2003, the section between Susanna Lane and Freyman Drive served as the interim Georgetown Branch Trail. In 2007, a section of trail was repaved from East-West Highway to just north of the newly repaired Capital Crescent Trail trestle. The retaining wall under the CCT trestle was also rebuilt, to improve the choke point at the curve directly below the trestle by increasing the sight distance. North Branch Trail The North Branch Connector Trail in Rockville, MD The North Branch Trail is a partially constructed trail along the North Branch of Rock Creek from the Rock Creek Stream Valley Trail to the ICC Trail and on to Olney, MD. A trail along Lake Frank, a connector from that to the Rock Creek Stream Valley Trail, the Emory Lane Bikeway, part of the ICC Trail and a pair of disconnected trails in the North Branch Stream Valley Park form the existing portions of the North Branch Trail. The trail was first proposed as part of the 1978 Montgomery County Bicycle Masters Plan and repeated in several plans since then. It will ultimately extend from the Rock Creek Stream Valley to the North Branch Stream Valley Park using trails along Lake Frank and bikeways along Emory Lane and Muncaster Mill Road. It will then use the ICC Bike trail to connect to a developer-built trail at the Preserve at Rock Creek residential development and then traverse the rest of North Branch Stream Valley Park to MD 108 in Olney along existing trails. =Lakeside Trail= The unpaved Lake Side Trail next to Lake Frank in Maryland The Lakeside Trail is a trail system along the south and east side of Lake Bernard Frank, with a connector to the Rock Creek Stream Valley Trail. It consists of 1.8 miles of paved trail and another 1.1 miles of shared-use natural surface trail. The Lakeside trail stretches from the Avery Road trailhead, around the lake and then north to Muncaster Mill Road with a connection to Trailway Drive. The northernmost section is unpaved. MNCPPC constructed the trail in the early 1980s and then connected it to the Rock Creek Trails in 2012. The county constructed a half- mile (0.8 km) long trail to connect it to the Rock Creek Stream Valley Trail as part of the ICC mitigation program. Preliminary design work on the connector trail began in 2006 when it was selected for funding by the Compensatory Mitigation and Environmental Stewardship fund for the Inter- County Connector (ICC). After a year-long controversy, during which the Manor Lake Civic Association fought the connector trail on grounds that a \\"bike highway\\" would drastically change the area around the lake, work began in 2010 and was completed in 2012. The connector was built atop an existing hiking trail. Montgomery County is planning to build an additional extension of this trail in 2021. Planning began in 2005 and the design was approved in 2017. The project would extend the paved trail north - at times using an existing abandoned road alignment, bridge the North Branch and connect with Muncaster Mill Road at both the east end of the existing Muncaster Mill Bikeway and near the intersection with Emory Road. As of August 2019, work was to start in Fall 2019/Spring 2020 and complete in Fall 2021. =Muncaster Mill and Emory Road Bikeways= The Muncaster Mill and Emory Road Bikeways are sidepaths that, when complete, will connect the North Branch trail to the ICC Trail. A 0.7-mile section of the Muncaster Mill Road bikeway from Avery Road to Meadowside Lane was constructed by the county between 2002 and 2008 when the road was redesigned following a fatal bus crash. The bikeway was extended west to the ICC Trail when that trail opened in July 2011. Montgomery County plans to extend the North Branch Trail along two paths in 2021, with one of them ending at the eastern terminus of this bikeway. A bikeway along Emory Lane between Georgia Avenue and Holly Ridge Lane was built between 2005 and 2008 and in 2011 it was connected to the ICC Trail. Montgomery County plans to extend the North Branch Trail along two paths in 2021, with one of them ending on Muncaster Mill east of the North Branch. The trail will be connected to the Emory Lane bikeway by a new bikeway along Muncaster Mill Road and an extension of the Emory Lane bikeway to it. =ICC Trail= The section of the ICC Trail, from Muncaster Mill Road to Emory Lane, that serves as part of the North Branch Trail opened on July 30, 2011. The section is 1.4 miles long, crosses the North Branch and runs directly adjacent to Maryland Route 200. With it, connections to both the Muncaster Mill Road and Emory Lane bikeways were created. =North Branch Stream Valley Trail= The North Branch Stream Valley Trail is a partially constructed trail that will eventually run north from the ICC Trail to Olney-Laytonsville Road. In the same corridor, the county will build the parallel Kengala Trail, a natural surface trail for all users. The first section of the trail north of Muncaster Mill was the 1.6-mile-long Wickham Road Bike Path in Olney which was constructed in 2002. It connected Laytonsville Road to trails planned along the North Branch as part of the Norbeck Grove development. Shortly afterward, developers built the Norbeck Grove Bike Path as part of that development. The mostly-paved path extends 1.8 miles from Bowie Mill Road to Olney Mills Road with connections to Wickham Road in 3 places, including the Wickham Road Bike Path; Rushbrooke Drive; Tothill Drive; Weston Place and Brightwood Road. Boardwalk section of Matthew Henson Trail In 2016‚Äì17 a 1.8-mile-long section of trail located north of the ICC on Park and Planning property was constructed as part of the Preserve at Rock Creek project. It includes connections to Harbiner Road and Heartwood Drive. Montgomery County plans to build a small connection from the Preserve at Rock Creek trail section under the ICC to the ICC Trail, and a bridge across the North Branch at the ICC to be part of the natural surface Kengala Trail. As of August 2019, work on the connection was to start in Fall 2019/Spring 2020 and complete in Fall 2021. The Bowie Mill Local Park section between the Preserve at Rock Creek and Bowie Mill Road, meanwhile, is in the 2016 Countywide Park Trails Plan as a future project, but there is no design or schedule for this section. Matthew Henson Trail The Matthew Henson Trail is a 4.2-mile-long paved trail through Matthew Henson State Park from Rock Creek to Alderton Road in Silver Spring along a corridor originally intended to serve as a highway. It starts out following Turkey Branch but then crosses over to the Anacostia Basin, crossing over Bel Pre Creek and ending near the Northwest Branch of the Anacostia River. It includes multiple connections near Bel Pre Neighborhood Park and Layhill Village Neighborhood Park.

It was proposed by Eugene Wigner in probability theory. The surmise was a result of Wigner's introduction of random matrices in the field of nuclear physics. The surmise consists of two postulates: *In a simple sequence (spin and parity are same), the probability density function for a spacing is given by, :: p_w(s) = \\\\frac{\\\\pi s}{2} e^{-\\\\pi s^2/4}. : Here, s = \\\\frac{S}{D} where S is a particular spacing and D is the mean distance between neighboring intervals. *In a mixed sequence (spin and parity are different), the probability density function can be obtained by randomly superimposing simple sequences. The above result is exact for 2\\\\times 2 real symmetric matrices, with elements that are independent and identically distributed standard gaussian random variables. In practice, it is a good approximation for the actual distribution for real symmetric matrices of any dimension. The corresponding result for complex hermitian matrices (which is also exact in the 2\\\\times 2 case and a good approximation in general) is given by :: p_w(s) = \\\\frac{32 s^2}{\\\\pi^2} e^{-4s^2/\\\\pi}.

Its nearest higher peak is Mount Cline, to the northeast. Mount Wilson is situated immediately north of the confluence of the North Saskatchewan River, Mistaya River, and Howse River near Saskatchewan Crossing, where the Icefields Parkway intersects with the David Thompson Highway.  History Mount Wilson honours Tom Wilson (1859‚Äì1933) who was an early explorer in the Canadian Rockies. The mountain was named in 1898 by Norman Collie. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1902 by James Outram and Christian Kaufmann. The mountain's name was made official in 1924 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology Like other mountains in Banff Park, Mount Wilson is composed of sedimentary rock laid down from the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. The west and south aspects of the mountain are characterized by rugged, rocky cliff bands, whereas the north and east aspects of Mount Wilson are covered by expansive glacial ice called the Wilson Icefield.

Viral shunting helps maintain diversity within the microbial ecosystem by preventing a single species of marine microbe from dominating the micro-environment. The DOM recycled by the viral shunt pathway is comparable to the amount generated by the other main sources of marine DOM.Robinson, Carol, and Nagappa Ramaiah. \\"Microbial heterotrophic metabolic rates constrain the microbial carbon pump.\\" The American Association for the Advancement of Science, 2011. Viruses can easily infect microorganisms in the microbial loop due to their relative abundance compared to microbes. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic mortality contribute to carbon nutrient recycling through cell lysis. There is evidence as well of nitrogen (specifically ammonium) regeneration. This nutrient recycling helps stimulates microbial growth.Tsai, An-Yi, Gwo-Ching Gong, and Yu-Wen Huang. \\"Importance of the Viral Shunt in Nitrogen Cycling in Synechococcus Spp. Growth in Subtropical Western Pacific Coastal Waters.\\" Terrestrial, Atmospheric & Oceanic Sciences25.6 (2014). As much as 25% of the primary production from phytoplankton in the global oceans may be recycled within the microbial loop through viral shunting.  Discovery and impact  Viral shunt was first described in 1999 by Steven W. Wilhelm and Curtis Suttle. Their original paper has since been cited over 1000 times. For his contributions to understanding of viral roles in marine ecosystems, Suttle has received numerous awards, including being named a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, receiving the A.G. Huntsman Award for Excellence in Marine Science, and the Timothy R. Parsons Medal for Excellence in Ocean Sciences from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. Both Suttle and Wilhelm have been elected Fellows of the American Academy of Microbiology as well as the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography. The field of marine virology has rapidly expanded since the mid-1990s, coinciding with the first publication of viral shunt. During this time, further studies have established the existence of the viral shunt as a \\"fact\\" of the field. The recycling of nutrients in the viral shunt has indicated to scientists that viruses are a necessary component in new models of global change. Virologists in soil sciences have begun to investigate the application of viral shunt to explain nutrient recycling in terrestrial systems.  Bacterial growth efficiency  There is evidence to suggest that the viral shunt system can directly control bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) in pelagic regions Carbon flow models indicated that decreased BGE could be largely explained by the viral shunt, which caused the conversion of bacterial biomass to DOM. The biodiversity in these pelagic environments are so tightly coupled that the production of viruses depends on their bacterial host metabolisms, so any factors that limit bacterial growth also limit viral growth. Enrichment of nitrogen has been observed to allow for an increase in viral production (up to 3-fold) but not bacterial biomass. Through the viral shunt pathway, the high viral-induced mortality relative to bacterial growth of this region resulted in the effective generation of DOC/DOM that is available for microbial re- consumption and offers an effective way to recycle key nutrients within the microbial food web. Data extracted from other aquatic regions such as the Western-North Pacific displayed large variability, which may be a result off methodologies and environmental conditions, nonetheless, a common trend appeared to be a reduced BGE with an increasing viral shunt pathway. From carbon flow models it is clear that viral shunting allows bacterial biomass to be converted to DOC/DOM that are ultimately recycled such that the bacteria may consume the DOC/DOM, indicating that the viral shunt pathway is a major regulator of BGE in marine pelagic waters.  Links to microbial processes   Microbial loop  The microbial loop acts as a pathway and connection between different relationships in an ecosystem. The microbial loop connects the pool of DOM to the rest of the food web, specifically various microorganisms in the water column. This allows for constant cycling of this dissolved organic matter. Stratification of the water column due to the pycnocline affects the amount of dissolved carbon in the upper mixing layer, and the mechanisms shows seasonal variation. The microbial loop is based on micro-interactions between different trophic levels of microbes and organisms. When nutrients enter the microbial loop, they tend to remain in the photic zone longer, due to the location, and slow sinking rates of microbes. Eventually, through varying processes, DOM, through use of available nutrients, is produced by phytoplankton, as well as consumed by bacteria. Bacteria utilize this DOM, yet are then preyed on by larger microbes, such as microflagelletes, which helps to regenerate nutrients. Viruses tend to outnumber bacterial abundance by about ten times and phytoplankton by about a hundred times in the upper mixing layer and bacterial abundance tends to decrease with depth, while phytoplankton remain closer to shallow depths. The effects of the viral shunt are more pronounced in the upper mixing layer. Viruses found can be non-specific (broad host range), abundant, and can infect all forms of microbes. Viruses are a magnitude higher in abundance in almost all aquatic locations compared to their microbial hosts, allowing high rates/levels of microbial infection. The impact of the viral shunt varies seasonally as many microbes show seasonal abundance maximums in temperate and oligotrophic waters during different times of the year, meaning viral abundance also varies with season.  Biological Pump  The viral shunt may result in increased respiration from the system. It also helps export carbon through the biological pump. This is a very significant process as approximately 3 gigatonnes of carbon may be sequestered per year due to lysed and virus-infected cells having faster sinking rates.Lawrence, Janice E., and Curtis A. Suttle. \\"Effect of viral infection on sinking rates of Heterosigma akashiwo and its implications for bloom termination.\\" Aquatic microbial ecology37.1 (2004): 1-7. The biological pump has an important role at sequestering carbon to the benthic zone, thereby impacting global carbon cycles, budget, and even affecting temperature. Crucial nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, cellular components, such as amino acids and nucleic acids, would be sequestered through the biological pump in the event of cells sinking. Viral shunting helps increase the efficiency of the biological pump by mostly altering the proportion of carbon that is exported to deep water (such as the recalcitrant carbon-rich cell walls from virally lysed bacteria) in a process called the Shunt and Pump. This allows the crucial nutrients to be retained in the surface waters. Concurrently, a more efficient biological pump also results in an increase in nutrient influx towards the surface, which is beneficial to primary production, especially in more oligotrophic region. Despite viruses being in the smallest scales of biology, the viral shunt pathway has a profound effect on food webs across marine environments as well as on a more macro scale on the global carbon budget.  Recycling of nutrients   Carbon cycling  Viral shunt influences carbon cycling in marine environments by infecting microbes and redirecting the type of organic matter that enters the carbon pool. Phototrophs constitute a large population of primary production in marine environments and are responsible for a large flux of carbon entering the carbon cycle in marine environments.Stockner, John G. \\"Phototrophic picoplankton: an overview from marine and freshwater ecosystems.\\" Limnology and Oceanography 33.4part2 (1988): 765-775. However, bacteria, zooplankton and phytoplankton, (and other free-floating organisms) also contribute to the global marine carbon cycle. When these organisms eventually die and decompose, their organic matter either enters the pool of particulate organic matter (POM) or dissolved organic matter (DOM). Much of the POM generated is composed of carbon-rich complex structures that is unable to be decomposed effectively by most prokaryotes and archaea in the oceans. Export of carbon-rich POM from the upper surface layer to deep oceans causes increased efficiency of the biological pump due to a higher carbon-to-nutrient ratio. DOM is smaller and tends to stay mixed within the euphotic zone of the water column. The labile DOM is easier for microbes to digest and recycle, allowing incorporation of carbon into biomass. As microbial biomass increases due to the incorporation of DOM, most microbial populations such as heterotrophic bacteria will be preyed on by organisms at higher trophic levels such as grazers or zooplankton. However, about 20 to 40 percent of the bacterial biomass (with similar and relative amounts of eukaryotes) will become infected by viruses, due to the viral shunt. The effect of this energy flow results in less carbon entering higher trophic levels and a significant portion being respired and cycled between the microbes in the water column.Suttle, Curtis A. \\"Viruses in the Sea.\\" Nature 437.7057 (2005): 356-61. ProQuest. Web. 22 Nov. 2018. Based on this mechanism, as more carbon enters the DOM pool, most of the matter is used for increasing microbial biomass. When the viral shunt kills a portion of these microbes, it decreases the amount of carbon that gets transferred to higher trophic levels by converting it back to DOM and POM. Most of the generated POM is recalcitrant and will eventually make it down to the deep oceans where it accumulates. The resulting DOM that re-enters the DOM pool to be used by phototrophs and heterotrophs is less than the amount of DOM that originally entered the DOM pool. This phenomenon is due to the unlikeliness of organic matter being 100% DOM after a viral lytic infection.  Nitrogen cycling  Flow chart of nitrification in the deep ocean (aphotic zone) and ammonium regeneration in the upper ocean surface (photic zone).  Nitrogen cycle  Viral shunt is a big component to the cycling of nitrogen in marine environments. Nitrogen gas from the atmosphere gets dissolved into surface of the water. Nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria, such as Trichodesmium and Anabaena, convert the nitrogen gas (N2) into ammonium (NH4+) for microbes to use. The process of converting nitrogen gas to ammonia (and related nitrogen compounds) is called nitrogen fixation.The process of uptake of ammonium by microbes to be used in protein synthesis is called nitrogen assimilation. The viral shunt causes mass death of heterotrophic bacteria. The decomposition of these microbes releases particulate organic nitrogen (PON) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), which either stay in the upper mixing layer or sink to the deeper parts of the ocean. In the deep ocean, PON and DON are converted back into ammonium by remineralisation. This ammonium can be used by deep ocean microbes, or undergo nitrification and be oxidized into nitrites and nitrates. The sequence of nitrification is: :NH4+ ‚Üí NO2‚àí ‚Üí NO3‚àí Dissolved nitrates can be consumed by microbes to become re-assimilated, or revert in nitrogen gas by denitrification. The resultant nitrogen gas can then be fixed back into ammonium for assimilation or exit the ocean reservoir and back into atmosphere.  Ammonium regeneration  Viral shunt is also able to increase ammonium production.Shelford, Emma J., et al. \\"Virus-driven nitrogen cycling enhances phytoplankton growth.\\" Aquatic microbial ecology66.1 (2012): 41-46. The basis for this claim is based on fluctuating carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N in atoms) ratios caused by the viral shunt. Susceptible microorganisms such as bacteria in the water column are more likely to be infected and killed off by viruses, releasing DOM and nutrients containing carbon and nitrogen (about 4C:1N). The remaining microbes that are still alive are assumed to be resistant to that viral infection episode. The DOM and nutrients generated from the death and lysis of susceptible microorganisms are available for uptake by virus-resistant eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The resistant-bacteria uptakes and utilizes the DOC, regenerate ammonium, thereby lowering the C:N ratio. When C:N ratios decrease, ammonium (NH4+) regeneration increases. The bacteria begin converting the dissolved nitrogen into ammonium, which can be used by phytoplankton for growth and biological production. As phytoplankton use up the ammonium (and subsequently limited by nitrogen-species), the C:N ratio begins increasing again and NH4+ regeneration slows down. The phytoplankton also shows enhanced growth rates due to uptake of ammonium. The viral shunt is continuously causing changes to the C:N ratio, affecting the composition and presence of nutrients at any given time.  Iron cycling  A significant fraction of the world's oceans are iron limited,Moore, J. Keith, et al. \\"Iron cycling and nutrient-limitation patterns in surface waters of the World Ocean.\\" Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography 49.1-3 (2001): 463-507. thus the regeneration of iron-nutrients is an important process that is needed for sustaining an ecosystem in this environment. Viral infection of microorganisms (mostly heterotrophs and cyanobacteria) is hypothesized to be an important process in the maintenance of high-nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) marine environments. The viral shunt plays a key role in releasing assimilated iron back into the microbial loop which helps sustain primary productivity in these ecosystems.Hutchins, D. A., et al. \\"An iron limitation mosaic in the California upwelling regime.\\" Limnology and Oceanography43.6 (1998): 1037-1054. Dissolved iron usually binds with organic matter to form an organic-iron complex that enhances bioavailability of this nutrient to plankton. Some species of bacteria and diatoms are capable of high uptake rates of these organic-iron complexes. Continued viral activity by the viral shunt helps sustain growing ecosystems in iron-limited HNLC regions.  Effect on the marine food web  Viral shunt increases the supply of organic and inorganic nutrients to the pelagic food web. These nutrients increase growth rates of picophytoeukaryotes, particularly in multivore systems. Crucial nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and DOM found within cells are lysed by the viral shunt pathway, and these nutrients remain within the microbial food web. Naturally, this prevents the export of biomass such as POM to higher trophic levels directly, by diverting the flow of carbon and nutrients from all microbial cells into a DOM pool, recycled and ready for uptake. Viruses that specifically target cyanobacteria known as cyanophages (found in surface waters) directly affects the marine food web by ‚Äúshort-circuiting‚Äù the amount of organic carbon that is transferred to higher trophic levels. These nutrients are made available for uptake by heterotroph bacteria and phytoplankton alike. The most common nutrient limiting primary productivity in marine waters is nitrogen, and others such as iron, silica, and vitamin B12 have also been discovered to limit growth rate of specific species and taxa. Studies have also identified that heterotrophic bacteria are commonly limited by organic carbon, however some nutrients that limit growth may not limit in other environments and systems. Therefore, viral lysis of these nutrients will have different effects on microbial food webs found in different ecosystems. Another important point to note (on a smaller scale) is that cells contain different fractions of nutrients and cellular components; this will result in different bioavailability of certain nutrients in the microbial food web. 374x374px  Important Organisms  There are many different microbes present in aquatic communities. Phytoplankton, specifically Picoplankton, are the most important organism in this microbial loop. They provide a foundation as primary producers; they are responsible for the majority of primary production in the ocean and around 50% of primary production of the entire planet. Generally, marine microbes are useful in the microbial loop due to their physical characteristics. They are small, and have high surface area to biomass ratios, allowing for high rates of uptake, even in low concentrations of nutrients. The microbial loop is considered a sink for nutrients such as carbon. Their small size allows for more efficient cycling of nutrients and organic matter compared to larger organisms. Additionally, microbes tend to be pelagic, floating freely in photic surface waters, before sinking down to deeper layers of the ocean. The microbial food web is important because it is the direct target of the viral shunt pathway and all subsequent effects are based on how the viruses affect their microbial hosts. Infection of these microbes through lysis or latent infection have a direct impact of the nutrients recycled, availability, and export within the microbial loop, which can have resonating effects throughout the trophic levels.  Shallow water hydrothermal vents  Shallow water hydrothermal vents found in the Mediterranean Sea contain a diverse and abundant microbial community known as ‚Äúhotspots‚Äù. These communities also contain temperate viruses. An increase in these viruses can cause large mortality of vent microbes, thereby reducing chemoautotrophic carbon production, while at the same time enhancing the metabolism of heterotrophs through recycling of DOC. These results indicate a tight coupling of viruses and primary/secondary production found in these hydrothermal vent communities, as well as having a major effect on the food web energy transfer efficiency to higher trophic levels.

The genus Congrogadus has an Indo-Pacific distribution. Characteristics The species in the genus Congrogadus differ from their other genera in the subfamily Congogadinae in that they do not have a spot on their shoulder, a similar spot beingloacted on the operculum. Their dorsal and anal fins have a higher number of rays than all the other species in the subfamily except for the species in the genus Halidesmus which can have up to 90 fin rays. Also compared to the related genera which may have three complete lateral lines, the species in Congrogadus have only have a single curtailed lateral line. In addition some species which are classified in the subgenus Congrogadoides have the gill membranes fused to the isthmus. The gill membranes of the subgenus Congrogadus are not fused while the species in that subgebus and in the third, Pilbaraichthys possess a posterior otic sensory canal pore, which is believed to assist the fish in detecting motion. Biology Congrogadus are secretive fish which hide among rocks and coral rubble and they occur from the surface down to . They feed mainly on crustaceans but larger specimens will take fish, and their large mouth enable them to swallow quite large prey. Most species of the subfamily are protogynous hermaphrodites but Congrogadus subducens appears to be different because the females greater than long have been observed to have small gonads, a feature which almost certainly means that they are not protogynous hermaphrodites. All of this subfamily lay eggs in a small clump. The eggs of species within Congragadus are a distinguishing feature of the genus as each egg is attached to a small hook which has a thin thread. When the egg mass begins to disintegrate the hook falls from the egg to be suspended underneath it by the thread. It is thought this allows the egg to attach itself to the substrate. Distribution The genus is found in the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean and some species have rather restricted distributions while c. subducens has been claimed over a wide distribution from northern Australia through the Malay Archipelago to Japan, although other sources state that it is endemic to Australia. Species The following species are classified as members of the genus Congrogadus: * Subgenus Congrogadoides ** Congrogadus amplimaculatus (Winterbottom, 1980) (Largespot eel blenny) ** Congrogadus malayanus (Weber, 1909) (Malayan eel blenny) ** Congrogadus spinifer (Borodin, 1933) (Spiny eel blenny) * Subgenus Congradadus ** Congrogadus hierichthys D.S.

History  The rise of the Cult of Mithras was the temple's most active time in the Roman Empire during the 1st century. The ruins were not discovered until 1998 through excavation of the site labeled, Grijpenveld. It now one of a total of four mithraea found in Belgium alone. Through excavation, the ruins help determine the building's original form. The remains found in the ritual pits were believed to be parts of the religious practices of the cult because of their close proximity to the mithraeum in comparison to the remainder of the excavation. Reconstruction drawing and photos of fragments of snake vessel (Tienen mithraeum)  Site  The Mithraic temple is located in the southwestern region of Tienen, on the edge of the town's border. Beside the mithraeum is a pebble road that leads to the center of Tienen as well as a discovered tumulus, built a century before the temple. Along the same path, a bronze plaque declaring the cult's devotion to Mithras was found.  Design  When entering the wooden frame of the temple, an aisle of cella, or an enclosed hall, appears with lined side benches known as podia. From the entrance a 12 meter long x 2 meter wide central path is found. At its end was a niche, which can be described as the mithraeum's central focus. Inside the building, the floor contained a 2 x 2 meter relief of the infamous scene of bull-killing, distinct to the god of Mithras. The arrangement of Greek-styled podia, or platforms, inside the temple was appropriate for large crowds gathered for sacred feasts. Dug below one of the side benches was a ravine originally built with a wooden lining, designed to hold water. A second ravine was discovered, but its location was perpendicular to the alternative channel. The complex was surrounded by a wooden fence, or palisade, defining the property lines of the mithraeum.  Archaeological remains  Ritual sites near the mithraeum, were found to contain nearly 14,000 animal remains. The few that could be fully reassembled were: 1 Spanish mackerel, 1 hare, 1 jackdaw, 2 eels, 10 piglets, 14 lambs, and 285 chickens. During the 1st and 2nd century, Spanish mackerel was a rare food found commonly in Roman sites due to its popularity. The reconstructed jackdaw relates to the usage of black birds in religious temples, which is specific to the religion of mithraism. A majority of these animals were pigs, sheep and chickens, killed in a juvenile state, while the other birds were killed as adults. Their ages are clues to Mithraic culture. Since animal sacrifices, especially as adolescents, are historically common in a variety of religions, this separates the sacrificial animals from other uses, such as food. Discoveries include Rhineland oil lamps, black-slipped beakers from Trier Beaker produced in Trier with decoration and the Latin motto: propino tibi, ‚ÄúI drink to you‚Äù (Tienen mithraeum), terra cotta statues and a bronze lamp depicting Silenus. One of the more obvious cultic wares discovered was an incense burner commonly used during religious ceremonies within the mithraeum. thumbHandle with lion of the krater from Rheinzabern with lion and snake in samian ware (Tienen mithraeum) This can be seen from the remnants of its fuel on the temple's floor tiles. In comparison to the vessels found in ordinary cemeteries, the vessels used by the Mithraic cult had enlarged proportions for their religious practices. In one of the sacred places of the Tienen Mithraeum, a burial site that contained a dagger, courseware and animal bones was excavated after the platform above it collapsed. The discovery of the building remains is evidence of the religion's growth from urban territories to more rural areas.

The First Origenist Crisis began in the late fourth century AD in Palestine and later spread to Egypt. It dealt with ideas discussed in some of Origen's writings that some members of the church hierarchy deemed heretical. Objections against Origen's writings and demands for his condemnation were first raised by Epiphanius of Salamis and later taken up by Jerome and Pope Theophilus of Alexandria, who were both initially supporters of Origen's teachings. Origen's defenders included Tyrannius Rufinus and John II, Bishop of Jerusalem. During the crisis, Theophilus issued a condemnation of Origen's incorporeal, non-anthropomorphic conception of God, a view which Theophilus himself had previously vocally supported. The crisis concluded with John Chrysostom, the Patriarch of Constantinople, being removed from his position at the Synod of the Oak in 403 AD for harboring Origenist monks who had been banished from Alexandria. The Second Origenist Crisis occurred in the sixth century AD during the reign of Justinian I. It is less well-documented than the first crisis and dealt more with the ideas of groups that had been influenced by Origen rather than with Origen's actual writings. It concluded with the Second Council of Constantinople in 553 AD possibly issuing an anathema against Origen, although scholars dispute whether the anathema condemning Origen was actually issued by the Council or if it was added later. First Origenist Crisis Palestinian phase St. Jerome in His Study (1480), by Domenico Ghirlandaio. Although initially a student of Origen's teachings, Jerome turned against him during the First Origenist Crisis. He nonetheless remained influenced by Origen's teachings for his entire life. The first Origenist crisis began in the late fourth century AD, coinciding with the beginning of monasticism in Palestine. The first stirring of the controversy came from the Cyprian bishop Epiphanius of Salamis, who was determined to root out all heresies and refute them. Epiphanius attacked Origen in his anti-heretical treatises Ancoratus (375) and Panarion (376), compiling a list of teachings Origen had espoused that Epiphanius regarded as heretical. Epiphanius's treatises portray Origen as an originally orthodox Christian who had been corrupted and turned into a heretic by the evils of \\"Greek education\\". Epiphanius particularly objected to Origen's Subordinationism, his \\"excessive\\" use of allegorical hermeneutic, and his habit of proposing ideas about the Bible \\"speculatively, as exercises\\" rather than \\"dogmatically\\". Epiphanius asked John, the bishop of Jerusalem to condemn Origen as a heretic. John refused on the grounds that a person could not be retroactively condemned as a heretic after the person had already died. In 393, a monk named Atarbius advanced a petition to have Origen and his writings to be censured. Tyrannius Rufinus, a priest at the monastery on the Mount of Olives who had been ordained by John of Jerusalem and was a longtime admirer of Origen, rejected the petition outright. Rufinus's close friend and associate Jerome, who had also studied Origen, however, came to agree with the petition. Around the same time, John Cassian, a Semipelagian monk, introduced Origen's teachings to the West. In 394, Epiphanius wrote to John of Jerusalem, again asking for Origen to be condemned, insisting that Origen's writings denigrated human sexual reproduction and accusing him of having been an Encratite. John once again denied this request. By 395, Jerome had allied himself with the anti-Origenists and begged John of Jerusalem to condemn Origen, a plea which John once again refused. Epiphanius launched a campaign against John, openly preaching that John was an Origenist deviant. He successfully persuaded Jerome to break communion with John and ordained Jerome's brother Paulinianus as a priest in defiance of John's authority. Meanwhile, in 397, Rufinus published a Latin translation of Origen's On First Principles. Rufinus was convinced that Origen's original treatise had been interpolated by heretics and that these interpolations were the source of the heterodox teachings found in it. He therefore heavily modified Origen's text, omitting and altering any parts which disagreed with contemporary Christian orthodoxy. In the introduction to this translation, Rufinus mentioned that Jerome had studied under Origen's disciple Didymus the Blind, implying that Jerome was a follower of Origen. Jerome was so incensed by this that he resolved to produce his own Latin translation of On the First Principles, in which he promised to translate every word exactly as it was written and lay bare Origen's heresies to the whole world. Jerome's translation has been lost in its entirety. Egyptian phase In 399, the Origenist crisis reached Egypt. Pope Theophilus of Alexandria was sympathetic to the supporters of Origen and the church historian, Sozomen, records that he had openly preached the Origenist teaching that God was incorporeal. In his Festal Letter of 399, he denounced those who believed that God had a literal, human-like body, calling them illiterate \\"simple ones\\". A large mob of Alexandrian monks who regarded God as anthropomorphic rioted in the streets. According to the church historian Socrates Scholasticus, in order to prevent a riot, Theophilus made a sudden about-face and began denouncing Origen. In the year 400, Theophilus summoned a council in Alexandria, which condemned Origen and all his followers as heretics for having taught that God was incorporeal, which they decreed contradicted the only true and orthodox position, which was that God had a literal, physical body resembling that of a human. Theophilus labelled Origen himself as the \\"hydra of all heresies\\" and persuaded Pope Anastasius I to sign the letter of the council, which primarily denounced the teachings of the Nitrian monks associated with Evagrius Ponticus. In 402, Theophilus expelled Origenist monks from Egyptian monasteries and banished the four monks known as the \\"Tall Brothers\\", who were leaders of the Nitrian community. John Chrysostom, the Patriarch of Constantinople, granted the Tall Brothers asylum, a fact which Theophilus used to orchestrate John's condemnation and removal from his position at the Synod of the Oak in July of 403. Once John Chrysostom had been deposed, Theophilus restored normal relations with the Origenist monks in Egypt and the first Origenist crisis came to an end. Second Origenist Crisis Beginning of the crisis The Emperor Justinian I, shown here in a contemporary mosaic portrait from Ravenna, denounced Origen as a heretic and ordered all of his writings to be burned. The Second Origenist Crisis occurred in the sixth century, during the height of Byzantine monasticism. Although the Second Origenist Crisis is not nearly as well documented as the first, it seems to have primarily concerned the teachings of Origen's later followers, rather than anything Origen himself had actually written. Origen's disciple Evagrius Ponticus had advocated contemplative, noetic prayer, but other monastic communities prioritized asceticism in prayer, emphasizing fasting, labors, and vigils. Some Origenist monks in Palestine, referred to by their enemies as \\"Isochristoi\\" (meaning \\"those who would assume equality with Christ\\"), emphasized Origen's teaching of the pre- existence of souls and held that all souls were originally equal to Christ's and would become equal again at the end of time. Another faction of Origenists in the same region instead insisted that Christ was the \\"leader of many brethren\\", as the first-created being. This faction was more moderate and they were referred to by their opponents as \\"Protoktistoi\\" (\\"First Createds\\"). Both factions accused the other of heresy and other Christians accused both of them of heresy. The Protoktistoi appealed to the Emperor Justinian I to condemn the Isochristoi of heresy through Pelagius, the papal apocrisarius. In 543 AD, Pelagius presented Justinian with documents, including a letter denouncing Origen written by Patriarch Mennas of Constantinople,Apocatastasis ¬ß2. Opponents in New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, Vol_ I, Aachen Basilians at Christian Classics Ethereal Library along with excerpts from Origen's On First Principles and several anathemata against Origen. A domestic synod convened to address the issue concluded that the Isochristoi's teachings were heretical and, seeing Origen as the ultimate culprit behind the heresy, denounced Origen himself as a heretic as well. Emperor Justinian ordered for all of Origen's writings to be burned. In the west, the Decretum Gelasianum, which was written sometime between 519 and 553, listed Origen as an author whose writings were to be categorically banned. Second Council of Constantinople In 553, during the early days of the Second Council of Constantinople (the Fifth Ecumenical Council), when Pope Vigilius was still refusing to take part in it, despite Justinian holding him hostage, the bishops at the council ratified an open letter which condemned Origen as the leader of the Isochristoi. The letter was not part of the official acts of the council and it more or less repeated the edict issued by the Synod of Constantinople in 543. It cites objectionable writings attributed to Origen, but all the writings referred to in it were actually written by Evagrius Ponticus. After the council officially opened, but while Pope Vigillius was still refusing to take part, Justinian presented the bishops with the problem of a text known as The Three Chapters, which attacked the Antiochene Christology. The bishops drew up a list of anathemata against the heretical teachings contained within The Three Chapters and those associated with them. In the official text of the eleventh anathema, Origen is condemned as a Christological heretic, but Origen's name does not appear at all in the Homonoia, the first draft of the anathemata issued by the imperial chancery, nor does it appear in the version of the conciliar proceedings that was eventually signed by Pope Vigillius, a long time afterwards. These discrepancies may indicate that Origen's name may have been retrospectively inserted into the text after the Council. Some authorities believe these anathemata belong to an earlier local synod. Even if Origen's name did appear in the original text of the anathema, the teachings attributed to Origen that are condemned in the anathema were actually the ideas of later Origenists, which had very little grounding in anything Origen himself had actually written. In fact, Popes Vigilius (537‚Äì555), Pelagius I (556‚Äì61), Pelagius II (579‚Äì90), and Gregory the Great (590‚Äì604) were only aware that the Fifth Council specifically dealt with The Three Chapters and make no mention of Origenism or Universalism, nor spoke as if they knew of its condemnation--even though Gregory the Great was opposed to Universalism.

Many people called Yang and Mao \\"The cutest boy and girl\\"(). Life Yang Yuying born on 11 May 1971 at a village in Nanchang. When she was young, her father died. She lived with her mother and sister. She started singing on stage at the age of five. She was active in the Nanchang Children's Palace Choir in her childhood. Later, she won many awards in the singing competition. In October 1990, she signed a contract with Guangzhou New Era Audio and Video Company to officially debut as a singer and became the first generation of Chinese singer. In the same year, she released her first solo album under the stage name ‚ÄúYang Yuying‚Äù. She only sold 200,000 boxes at the Southern Audio and Video Group National Winter Order Fair held in Zhuhai in December of that year. As a newcomer, she set up a mainland singer. Unprecedented success has become an eye-catching star in the Chinese record industry. On December 14, 1991, with the support of the record company, Yang Yuying boarded the stage of the \\"Gold and Silver List\\" column of CCTV's \\"Rotating Stage\\" column, sang the songs \\"Chashan Love Song\\" and \\"Wind Love, Water and Smile\\" and immediately triggered The craze, the 20-year-old Yang Yuying became a household star in the mainland, and became a household star in the mainland. Countless people saw her appearance on TV and heard her singing. In 1992, Yang Yuying's album \\"Wind and Love, Water and Smile\\" became the first album in the history of Chinese songs to be sold in the same year, which is a million-dollar original record. This has also become the mainland's original pop music. A landmark event in the audiovisual market situation. In the early 1990s, Yang Yuying was very popular in China's music scene, especially with the singer Mao Ning's partner performance. It was hailed as \\"The Cutest Boy and Girl\\", and the two-part concert singer \\"The Heart Rain\\" has been widely sung. As one of the representative singers of the ‚ÄúGuangdong Pop Music‚Äù and ‚Äú94 New Generation‚Äù in the pop music boom of mainland China, the great success of Yang Yuying‚Äôs singing career has established her important position in the history of Chinese pop music development. In a program, Yang Yuying disclosed that she had a relationship with Lai Wenfeng, nephew of Lai Changxing, and was quickly pushed to the forefront of public opinion. Although she insisted that the 23-year-old himself and the 21-year-old Lai Wenfeng started a simple relationship in 1994 and broke up in 1997, they still attracted all kinds of rumors. In 1997, Yang Yuying suddenly announced that she was fading out of the singer's career, and the original record of the mainland's original record and the myth of Chinese native idol singers have not been broken and surpassed. At the beginning of 2012, Yang Yuying returned to the stage again, still showing a strong market appeal, and the media attention and influence did not diminish. Since then, Yang Yuying has appeared frequently in public media and in commercial performances, and has been enthusiastically embraced by a large number of fans of all ages. Yang Yuying was widely reported by the media as the singer with the highest sales volume in mainland China. As of 2012, its total sales of genuine albums reached more than 20 million. Considering that in the early 1990s, the development of the popular music and video industry in the mainland, the audiovisual market was monopolized by pirated publications, and the actual sales volume should be much higher than this, but the specific data is difficult to count.

The album was among Slater's most personal works to date, and his intention for the album was to record music that went beyond the four-to-the-floor nature of techno and push the genre's barriers, resulting in an eclectic, minimal album that also incorporates funk, acid techno and electro styles. The album varies in tone, with aggressive techno tracks and softer, less upbeat material. The album was promoted by the single \\"Freek Funk,\\" and was also Slater's first release in the United States. The producer supported the record with a live tour. Upon release, Freek Funk received critical acclaim and helped popularise Slater's music. It went on to influence many techno and breakbeat producers, and is today hailed as an ambitious album. In 2017, Mixmag named it the fifth greatest techno album of the 1990s. Background and production Throughout the 1990s, Slater built up a reputation as an influential British techno producer, taking influence from Detroit techno in particular and releasing material under the name Planetary Assault Systems. In 1996, he signed to Peacefrog Records for the second time in his career, on which he released the first Planetary Assault Systems album, The Electric Funk Machine (1997), which featured alterations in suctioned percussion and bass. Follow-up album The Drone Sector was also released by Peacefrog Records later that year. Following these releases, Slater signed to NovaMute Records, a techno label owned by Mute Records home to fellow producers Speedy J and Richie Hawtin. While on the label, Slater began releasing his most personal work. His first album for the label, and first major label record, Freek Funk was written and produced by Slater, with the \\"delicious talents\\" of Hulal aiding the recording. Slater's plan for Freek Funk was to write music that was not necessarily techno of a four-to-the-floor nature, and as a result \\"wrote the tracks I wanted and it ended up quite varied,\\" as he told an interviewer. He elaborated: \\"I didn't want to what people expected, but on the other hand I didn't want to purposefully not do it. I might be born of perversion but the album's not.\\" Composition Freek Funk is a sleek and lush album, and continues Slater's Detroit-influenced techno sound, but is more experimental, covering a variety of styles including abrasive techno, string-laden house and ambient music reminiscent of film scores. The album also features styles of electronic funk and acid techno, and was referred to by writer Andy Hermann as a fusion of techno, funk and electro. The NME felt the album was \\"sinister mechanical soul\\" music that was steeped in \\"traditional techno manoeuvres,\\" while Emma Morgan of Select noted that the \\"vast and varied affair\\" alternates between \\"twinkling soundscapes and tinny floorfillers.\\" Dave Turner of Mixmag felt the album was a collection of aggressive techno tracks which is nonetheless relieved with the inclusion of the calmer tracks \\"Zebediah\\" and \\"Walking the Line.\\" Writer Tim Haslett noted Slater's \\"kicked-drummed minimalism\\" sound and felt he \\"[occupied] techno's basic structures and [turned] them inside-out to make them fit his design.\\" The album's sixteen tracks are characterised by their organic percussion sounds. Throughout the album are four numbered \\"Score\\" tracks which Morgan compared to Vangelis' Blade Runner soundtrack. The opening track \\"Purely\\" announces the album's \\"tough techno\\" sound from its first kick. \\"Origin\\" is an intense rave track dominated by bleep sounds. \\"Score Two\\" features a cinematic atmosphere, whereas the following track \\"Are You There\\" is an electro track, with an \\"Egyptian boom-bap\\" style that writer Aaron M. Gonsher felt revealed Slater's \\"vocoded weirdness.\\" \\"Engine One\\" is a relentless, intense techno piece, while the title track is a hypnotic and complex composition, and was described by Morgan as reminiscent of \\"Talking Heads' 'Once in a Lifetime' playing from the Voyager probe in place of Bach's 'Brandenburg Concerto No. 2'.\\" It opens with choir samples and a metallic keyboard sequence before the serene mood is interrupted by a looped, distorted Roland TR-808 kick drum sound. Guitar noise soon appears, albeit put through many filters and effect pedals so that the original instrument is almost unrecognisable. \\"Zebediah\\" is a trip hop-styled track with dub music influences, and is reminiscent of the \\"spiritual bliss\\" of Orbital. \\"Bless Bless\\" features a distressed funk sound, and incorporates rattly but rigid percussion, a drifting bassline and swirly sample bed. By contrast, following track \\"Filter 2\\" features an industrial \\"sound wall\\" style, and is similar to \\"Option\\" in its \\"ravey whirlpool\\" style. \\"Score Four (Black Cloud Over Zin Vortex)\\" is characterised by spacey textures and \\"fraught atmospheres\\" similarly to \\"Zebediah.\\" \\"Time Dancer\\" has been described as a \\"peak-time head spinner.\\" The album is closed by the abstract hip-hop of \\"Walking the Line\\". Release and reception Freek Funk was released by NovaMute on 20 October 1997. In the United States, where NovaMute also released the album, it was Slater's first release, although he had built up a following among \\"import fiends\\" in the country. The title track was released as the album's first single. It contained the B-side \\"Stomp\\", a techno track incorporating broken beats. Upon release, Freek Funk was critically acclaimed, and according to writer Justin Kleinfeld, it put Slater \\"on top of the electronic music circuit.\\" Dave Hoffman of PopMatters reflected that the album \\"was popular on dancefloors all over the world.\\" The album also was a relative commercial success in that it topped the dance charts. In a favourable review, Emma Morgan of Select wrote: \\"As palatable to technoheads as to anyone kicked into touch by Daft Punk's recent triumphs, Freek Funk is a momentarily unifying force as dance music continues to divide and regenerate at light speed.\\" Option called the album \\"an enjoyable collection. It sputters by smoothly and coherently, a 75-minute set of logical progressions.\\" They praised Slater for creating a unified album \\"suitable for solitary consumption,\\" feeling this was unlike many techno producers who the writer felt would make \\"healfhearted\\" albums instead. Praise was given to the title track for being intricate without seeming \\"fussy or overwrought,\\" and for \\"Bless Bless\\" for being \\"outstanding.\\" Vincent Brunner of Les Inrockuptibles felt that the album is \\"as much for dancers as for dreamers, provided they do not have short breath and low vision.\\" He complimented the variety of styles and the music's \\"human\\" feel, and felt that Slater was \\"moving forward\\", describing the record as \\"a veritable kaleidoscope of techno.\\" Andy Crysell of NME hailed the album for reminding listeners of techno's \\"fantastical\\" sound. In their year-end lists of the best albums of 1997, Muzik ranked the album 18th, Nojesguiden ranked it 19th, and OOR ranked it 33rd. Tim Haslett of CMJ New Music Monthly wrote in December 1997 that Freek Funk was a \\"treat\\" and commented: \\"No wonder he counts people like Robert Hood and Carl Craig among his followers.\\" He felt the album's \\"effect\\" was \\"similar to that of reaching a difficulty level in a video game that the game's designers hadn't planned for.\\" Among retrospective reviews, John Bush of AllMusic felt that the album was Slater's most precise and emotional album to date, while also noting its musical experimentation and variety. He concluded that Slater was \\"[o]ne of the few British producers who seems to realize that interesting sounds aren't quite as important as investing the music with spirit,\\" and described Freek Funk as \\"one of the best techno LPs of the year.\\" Resident Advisor felt the record consolidated on previous Slater productions, such as the Al Sage collaboration \\"Freebase\\" and \\"important releases\\" released under the pseudonyms Planetary Assault System and Clementine. Legacy Following the album's release, Slater discussed playing the album live, and announced to Select that he was going to perform a range of songs from the album and other sources on its accompanying tour. Since its release, Freek Funk has gone on to be considered an influential album; Resident Advisor wrote that the album made an immediate, heavy impact on the techno and breakbeat scenes, and felt that it inspired \\"the next generation of electro-tinged breaks and nu-skool techno.\\" Slater was surprised by the album's influence, saying: \\"It was a great feeling to be honest. I was trying to push the barriers of the techno thing. I was surprised.\\" Paul Cooper of Pitchfork felt the album was \\"ambitious and innovative.\\" In 1999, French magazine Trax included the album in their unordered list of \\"The 50 Best Techno Albums 1989-1989,\\" while in 2017, Mixmag ranked the album at number 5 in their list of \\"The 10 best 90s techno albums\\". They said Slater delivered an \\"epic\\" album where \\"every track is potent to keep listeners locked in,\\" and felt that the record \\"sounds like an invasion from an off-world colony of dance freaks.\\" That same year, they also included the album on a list of 20 notable electronic albums released in 1997, and told listeners to \\"revisit Freek Funk to remind yourself of the magic [Slater] conjured up 20 years ago.\\" Writer Paul Morley included the album in a list of 100 great albums \\"that map out the universe as it is because of Kraftwerk.\\" Track listing All songs written by Luke Slater #\\"Purely\\" ‚Äì 8:02 #\\"Score One\\" ‚Äì 1:46 #\\"Origin\\" ‚Äì 3:14 #\\"Score Two\\" ‚Äì 2:06 #\\"Are You There?\\" ‚Äì 4:52 #\\"Score Two (Message from Hulal)\\" ‚Äì 2:20 #\\"Engine One\\" ‚Äì 6:45 #\\"Freek Funk\\" ‚Äì 7:51 #\\"Zebediah\\" ‚Äì 6:57 #\\"Bless Bless\\" ‚Äì 4:21 #\\"Filter 2\\" ‚Äì 6:16 #\\"Time Dancer\\" ‚Äì 6:15 #\\"Score Four (Black Cloud Over Zin Vortex)\\" ‚Äì 1:06 #\\"Love\\" ‚Äì 6:14 #\\"Black Cloud (Epilogue)\\" ‚Äì 1:29 #\\"Walking the Cloud\\" ‚Äì 5:20 Personnel *Luke Slater ‚Äì production, writing *Hulal ‚Äì recording *House ‚Äì design *Spiros Politis ‚Äì photography References 1997 debut albums Novamute Records albums Luke Slater albums Instrumental albums ","title":"Freek Funk"},{"id":"58757414","text":"The 9th Infantry Division is a division of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN), first formed from Viet Cong units in 1964/5 in the Mekong Delta region.

His headquarters were at the stone frigate HMS Baldur, based at Hvitanes, in Hvalfj√∂r√∞ur fjord, on the west coast of Iceland. It was initially administered by the Admiral Commanding, Iceland (C), then as the Flag Officer Commanding, Iceland (C), from 1942 to 1945. The post holder was responsible for commanding the Iceland (C) station. History Following the German invasion of Denmark in April 1940, Iceland, then in personal union with Denmark, declared neutrality throughout the rest of the war. Iceland's location was of strategic importance to the British who decided to station naval forces at a naval base called HMS Baldur at Hvitanes following the invasion of Iceland in May 1940. In addition it also established an accounting and accommodation shore base called HMS Baldur II. Iceland was an important base for North Atlantic convoys, patrol and anti-submarine duties. The Admiralty appointed a flag officer to administer the station. On 5 September 1941 Rear-Admiral Frederick Dalrymple-Hamilton was appointed as Admiral Commanding, Iceland, serving until August 1942. His title changed to Flag officer Commanding, Iceland (C) in 1943. During the war Winston Churchill instructed British officers to refer to the country as Iceland (C) due to someone ordering a ship to go to Ireland instead of Iceland at the beginning of the war. On 31 October 1943 Bertram Watson was appointed Flag Officer Commanding, Iceland, where he served in the rank of Rear Admiral until 7 August 1945. The 1945 Navy List records Watson as holding the position in the rank of Vice Admiral.

Its discovery was led by the laboratory of Nancy Sullivan at the United States National Institute of Health Vaccine Research Center and J. J. Muyembe-Tamfum from the Institut National pour la Recherche Biomedicale (INRB) in the Democratic Republic of Congo, working in collaboration with the Institute of Biomedical Research and the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. mAb114 was isolated from the blood of a survivor of the 1995 outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of Congo roughly ten years later. In early 2018, a Phase 1 clinical trial of mAb114 was conducted by Martin Gaudinski within the Vaccine Research Center Clinical Trials Program that is led by Julie E. Ledgerwood. mAb114 is also being evaluated during the 2018 North Kivu Ebola outbreak. mAb114 has also shown success with lowering the mortality rate from ~70% to about 34%. In August 2019, Congolese health authorities, the World Health Organization, and the U.S. National Institutes of Health promoted the use of mAb114, alongside REGN-EB3, a similar Regeneron-produced monoclonal antibody treatment, over other treatments yielding higher mortality rates, after ending clinical trials during the outbreak.  Chemistry  The drug is composed of a single monoclonal antibody (mAb) and was initially isolated from immortalized B-cells that were obtained from a survivor of the 1995 outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of Congo. In work supported by the United States National Institutes of Health and the Defense Advanced Projects Agency, the heavy and light chain sequences of mAb114 mAb was cloned into CHO cell lines and initial production runs were produced by Cook Phamica d.b.a. Catalent under contract of Medimmune.  Mechanism of action   Neutralization  mAb114 is a monoclonal antibody therapy that is infused intravenously into patients with Ebola virus disease. mAb114 is a neutralizing antibody, meaning It binds to a protein on the surface of Ebola virus that is required to infect cells. Specifically, mAb114 neutralizes infection by binding to a region of the Ebola virus envelope glycoprotein that, in the absence of mAb114, would interact with virus's cell receptor protein, Niemann- Pick C1 (NPC1). This \\"competition\\" by mAb114 prevents Ebola virus from binding to NPC1 and \\"neutralizes\\" the virus's ability to infect the targeted cell.  Effector function  Antibodies have antigen-binding fragment (Fab) regions and constant fragment (Fc) regions. The Neutralization of virus infection occurs when the Fab regions of antibodies binds to virus antigen(s) in a manner that blocks infection. Antibodies are also able to \\"kill\\" virus particles directly and/or kill infected cells using antibody-mediated \\"effector functions\\" such as opsonization, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent phagocytosis. These effector functions are contained in the Fc region of antibodies, but is also dependent on binding of the Fab region to antigen. Effector functions also require the use of complement proteins in serum or Fc- receptor on cell membranes. mAb114 has been found to be capable of killing cells by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Other functional killing tests have not been performed.  History   Discovery  A 2016 paper describes the efforts of how mAb114 was originally developed as part of research efforts lead by Dr. Nancy Sullivan at the United States National Institute of Health Vaccine Research Center and Dr. J. J. Muyembe-Tamfum from the Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale (INRB) in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This collaborative effort also involved researchers from Institute of Biomedical Research and the Unites States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. A survivor from the 1995 outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of Congo donated blood to the project that began roughly ten years after they had recovered. Memory B cells isolated from the survivor's blood were immortalized, cultured and screened for their ability to produce monoclonal antibodies that reacted with the glycoprotein of Ebola virus. mAb114 was identified from one of these cultures and the antibody heavy and light chain gene sequences were sequenced from the cells. These sequences were then cloned into recombinant DNA plasmids and purified antibody protein for initial studies was produced in cells derived from HEK 293 cells.  mAb114 and mAb100 combination  In an experiment described in the 2016 paper, rhesus macaques were infected with Ebola virus and treated with a combination of mAb114 and another antibody isolated from the same subject, mAb100. Three doses of the combination were given once a day starting 1 day after the animals were infected. The control animal died and the treated animals all survived.  mAb114 monotherapy  In a second experiment described in the 2016 paper, rhesus macaques were infected with Ebola virus and only treated with mAb114. Three doses of mAb114 were given once a day starting 1 day or 5 days after the animals were infected. The control animals died and the treated animals all survived. Unpublished data referred to in a publication of the 2018 Phase I clinical trial results of mAb114, reported that a single infusion of mAb114 provided full protection of rhesus macaques and was the basis of the dosing used for human studies.  Development  mAb114 was developed by the Vaccine Research Center with support of the United States National Institutes of Health and the Defense Advanced Projects Agency. The heavy and light chain sequences of mAb114 mAb were cloned into CHO cell lines to enable large-scale production of antibody product for use in humans.  Human safety testing  In early 2018, a Phase 1 clinical trial of mAb114's safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics was conducted by Dr. Martin Gaudinski within the Vaccine Research Center Clinical Trials Program that is led by Dr. Julie E. Ledgerwood. The study was performed in the United States at the NIH Clinical Center and tested single dose infusions of mAb114 infused over 30 minutes. The study showed that mAb114 was safe, had minimal side effects and had a half-life of 24 days.  Ridgeback Biotherapeutics  A license for mAb114 was obtained by Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP in 2018 from the National Institutes of Health-National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP is a small biotechnology company that focuses on pediatric orphan and emerging infectious diseases. mAb114 was given orphan drug status in May 2019.  Experimental use in the Democratic Republic of Congo  During the 2018 √âquateur province Ebola outbreak, mAb114 was requested by the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Ministry of Public Health. mAb114 was approved for compassionate use by the World Health Organization MEURI ethical protocol and at DRC ethics board. mAb114 was sent along with other therapeutic agents to the outbreak sites.WHO: Consultation on Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered and Investigational Interventions for Ebola virus Disease. https://www.who.int/emergencies/ebola/MEURI-Ebola.pdf However, the outbreak came to a conclusion before any therapeutic agents were given to patients. Approximately one month following the conclusion of the √âquateur province outbreak, a distinct outbreak was noted in Kivu in the DRC (2018‚Äì20 Kivu Ebola outbreak). Once again, mAb114 received approval for compassionate use by WHO MEURI and DRC ethic boards and has been given to many patients under these protocols. In November 2018, the Pamoja Tulinde Maisha (PALM [together save lives]) open-label randomized clinical control trial was begun at multiple treatment units testing mAb114, REGN-EB3 and remdesivir to ZMapp. Despite the difficulty of running a clinical trial in a conflict zone, investigators have enrolled 681 patients towards their goal of 725. An interim analysis by the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) of the first 499 patient found that mAb114 and REGN-EB3 were superior to the comparator ZMapp. Overall mortality of patients in the ZMapp and remdesivir groups were 49% and 53% compared to 34% and 29% for mAb114 and REGN-EB3. When looking at patients who arrived early after disease symptoms appeared, survival was 89% for mAB114 and 94% for REGN-EB3. While the study was not powered to determine whether there is any difference between REGN-EB3 and mAb114, the survival difference between those two therapies and ZMapp was significant. This led to the DSMB halting the study and PALM investigators dropping the remdesivir and ZMapp arms from the clinical trial. All patients in the outbreak who elect to participate in the trial will now be given either mAb114 or REGN-EB3. In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved atoltivimab/maftivimab/odesivimab (Inmazeb, formerly REGN-EB3) with an indication for the treatment of infection caused by Zaire ebolavirus.

Accession  In October 1923, a slave from Hamad bin Ibrahim's household murdered the-then Ruler of Umm Al Quwain (and Hamad's cousin), Sheikh Abdullah bin Rashid Al Mualla II. Immediately following the funeral, Hamad out-smarted Abdullah's younger brother, Ahmad bin Rashid, and occupied the government house. Hamad managed to balance the ensuing situation and made his peace with Ahmad bin Rashid as well as the families of Umm Al Quwain and, by the time the British Resident visited in March 1924, Hamad was clearly the accepted Ruler of the emirate. Having given sanctuary to the deposed Ruler of Sharjah, Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmad Al Qasimi, Sheikh Hamad managed to avoid a conflict with the Ruler of Sharjah, Sheikh Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi, when Khalid bin Ahmad reached a settlement with Sultan which ceded the inland town of Dhaid to him. Unable to take possession of the town because armed Bedouin loyal to Sultan were still there (and Hamad bin Ibrahim being unwilling to have his own forces dragged into a conflict with the Bedouin of the Interior), Khalid managed to broker an association between the Sheikhs of the Bani Qitab and Khawatir Bedouin tribes along with the Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah, which would have him take and hold Dhaid 'on behalf of Khaled bin Ahmed'. To the relief of both Hamad bin Ibrahim and his Northern neighbour, the plan (which would have potentially alienated Sultan of Sharjah) was not needed: Khaled took possession of Dhaid peacefully in July 1928.  Death  Hamad was shot and killed on 9 February 1929, by a slave called Saeed from the household of Hamad's blind uncle, Abdelrahman bin Ahmed Al Mualla. He was succeeded by Ahmad bin Rashid Al Mualla following a colourful incident whereby the population of the town rose up against Abdelrahman and Saeed, who had barricaded themselves in the fort. Abandoning their initial plan of firing on the fort with a cannon, the people of the town instead elected to set a fire around the walls of the fort and in this conflagration both Abrelrahman and Saeed were killed. The British considered the whole affair to be highly suspicious and suspected Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi of Sharjah of involvement, but confirmed the young Ahmed as a Trucial Ruler nonetheless.

The protesters appealed against the sentence after it came to light that Altham had family ties to the oil industry. Altham is a circuit judge in the Crown Court in Lancaster Castle. He is a descendant of James Altham, himself a judge who presided over the Lancashire witch trials. Altham was born in Morecambe and attended Sandylands Primary School, Morecombe and Lancaster Royal Grammar School before studying Latin and Greek at University College London. He then gained his law qualifications at Birmingham University and the Inns of Court School of Law. He was called to the Bar at Gray's Inn in 1993 and went on to join the chambers of David Steer QC in Liverpool. In 2008 he became a Recorder. Gordon Marsden, the MP for Blackpool South contacted the Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox to raise questions about Altham's handling of the 2018 fracking protest case, asking whether would \\"undertake an investigation into compliance with the Judicial Code of Conduct in relation to the trial\\". At an appeal hearing held on 17 October Lord Burnett, Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales ruled that an \\"immediate custodial sentence in the case of these appellants was manifestly excessive\\". After saying that a community order imposing on them unpaid work would have been appropriate. However in light of the fact they had spent six weeks in prison, he reduced the sentence to a conditional discharge. Judicial Conduct Investigations Office spokesperson indicated they had received a complaint concerning Judge Robert Altham, which \\"will be considered in accordance with the Judicial Conduct Rules 2014\\".

His Marks and Monograms on Pottery and Porcelain, first published in 1863, has appeared in many later editions. Life Chaffers was the son of William Chaffers and wife Sarah, and was born in Watling Street, London, in 1811; he was descended from a brother of Richard Chaffers (1731‚Äì1765), a manufacturer of Liverpool porcelain. He was educated at Margate and at Merchant Taylors' School, where he was entered in 1824. He was attracted to antiquarian studies while a clerk in the city of London, by the discovery of Roman and medieval antiquities in the foundations of the Royal Exchange during 1838‚Äì9. At the same time he began to concentrate attention upon the study of gold and silver plate and ceramics, especially in regard to the official and other marks by which dates and places of fabrication can be distinguished. In 1863 Chaffers published two important works: * Hall Marks on Gold and Silver Plate, illustrated, with Tables of Annual Date Letters employed in the Assay Offices of the United Kingdom; in the 8th edition of 1896 it included \\"Histories of the Goldsmiths' Trade, both in England and France, and revised London and Provincial Tables\\", and an introductory essay by C. A. Markham. * Marks and Monograms on Pottery and Porcelain of the Renaissance and Modern Periods, with Historical Notices of each Manufactory, preceded by an introductory Essay on Vasa Fictilia of the Greek, Romano-British, and Medi√¶val Eras. The aim of the work was to be for ceramics what Franz Brulliot's Dictionnaire des Monogrammes was to painting, and it at once established Chaffers as the leading authority upon his subject. Many subsequent editions have appeared, revised by later editors; the 9th edition appeared in 1900, and the 15th edition in 1965. Other publications are The Keramic Gallery, in 2 volumes, with 500 illustrations (1872); a handbook abridged from Marks and Monograms (1874); Gilda Aurifabrorum, a history of goldsmiths and plate workers and their marks (1883); also a priced catalogue of coins, and other minor catalogues. His reputation was furthered in organizing exhibitions of art treasures, at Manchester in 1857, South Kensington in 1862, Leeds in 1869, Dublin in 1872, Wrexham in 1876, and Hanley (at the great Staffordshire exhibition of ceramics) in 1890. Chaffers was elected Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1843, and he was a frequent contributor to Arch√¶ologia, to Notes and Queries, and to various learned periodicals upon the two subjects of which he had particular knowledge. In 1841 he married Charlotte Matilda, daughter of John Hewett. About 1870 he retired from Fitzroy Square to a house in Willesden Lane, and later moved to West Hampstead, where he died on 12 April 1892.

Early life  Rovshan Rzayev was born 15 October 1969 in Baku, Azerbaijan. He studied at the secondary school in Baku and later continued his education at the Higher Military School of Vladikavkaz, Russia. He voluntarily joined the ranks of Azerbaijani Armed Forces and frequently visited the front line.  Military career  He was appointed the Commander of the regiment of the company. He killed dozens of Armenian soldiers in the battles around the villages of Pircamal, Aranz…ômin, ≈ûelli, Nakhichevanik and Paprav…ônd in Agdam District. Although he suffered severe injuries during the battle in the Nakhichevanik village in 1992, he didn‚Äôt leave alone his military personnel and saved the lives of many of the injured soldiers. After completing his military service in Nagorno-Karabakh, Rovshan Rzayev was the commander of various military units at different times. Subsequently, he worked as a commander of the guard unit at the Gobustan high-security prison. On January 8, 1999, a riot took place in the security prison in which he was the commander of the guard unit at that time. The soldiers were taken hostage by a group of prisoners. Rovshan immediately went to the prison when he heard about this event. He reached the agreement with the prisoners that they were going to release the soldiers and Rovshan himself remained as a hostage. Rovshan Rzayev was killed by the prisoners while he was performing his duties.  Personal life  Rovshan Rzayev was married and had two children.  Honors  Rovshan Rzayev was posthumously awarded the title of \\"National Hero of Azerbaijan\\" by Presidential Decree No. 73 dated 12 January 1999.

Israeli law in the West Bank settlementsIs a New Israeli Bill Creeping Annexation of West Bank?, Yonah Jeremy Bob, Jerusalem Post, 5 September 2017Fearing International Ire, Netanyahu Blocks Annexation ‚Äì but Promotes Applying Israeli Laws to Settlements, Haaretz, Jonathan Lis, 17 February 2018 refers to application of Israeli law to Israeli settlements and Israeli civilians in Area C of the West Bank, a Palestinian territory under military occupation and therefore otherwise subject to military law. Some provisions are applied on a personal basis, such that it applies to Israeli residents rather than territory. Application of the laws has created \\"enclaves\\" of Israeli law in the Israeli- occupied West Bank,Gilead Sher, The Application of Israeli Law to the West Bank: De Facto Annexation?, INSS Insight No. 638, December 4, 2014 and the term \\"enclave law\\" or \\"enclave-based justice\\" is used to describe the resulting legal system. In parallel, other portions of Israeli law, including Israeli criminal law, are applied to Israelis on a personal basis in the West Bank. Since January 2018, all laws proposed in the Knesset are actively considered vis √† vis their application to the settlements. Implementation in practice Territorial aspects of \\"enclave law\\" are implemented via a method called \\"pipelining\\". Under this method, Israeli Military Orders, which constitute the primary laws in the West Bank, apply Israeli laws specifically to the jurisdictions of the Israeli settlement local councils. This method is used to give Israeli ministries, such as the Israeli Ministry of Education and Israeli Health Ministry, jurisdiction over public facilities such as schools and hospitals in the territories. Dual legal system Through this system, Israeli settlers are subject to large portions of Israeli law whereas Palestinians are subject to a combination of Israeli military law and some local laws based on Jordanian law. In 1989, Eyal Benvenisti described how \\"through extensive military legislation, exterritorial application of Israeli legislation and Israeli court rulings\\" the border between Israel and the West Bank was no longer relevant for \\"almost all legal purposes that reflect Israeli interests\\", but the same was not true for the Palestinian population, especially with respect to civil rights. Israeli laws that are applicable to Israeli citizens living in the West Bank are often administrative in nature, and include taxation, product supervision, national insurance, education, welfare, health, work, personal status,◊ê◊ë◊ô◊®◊ù, ◊ê◊û◊ô◊™◊ô, ◊©◊ô◊¢◊®◊ï◊ö ◊õ◊°◊§◊ô◊ù ◊î◊û◊ï◊ó◊ñ◊®◊ô◊ù ◊¢◊ú- ◊ô◊ì◊ô ◊®◊©◊ï◊ô◊ï◊™ ◊¶◊ô◊ë◊ï◊®◊ô◊ï◊™ ◊ë◊ê◊ñ◊ï◊® ◊ô◊î◊ï◊ì◊î ◊ï◊î◊©◊ï◊û◊®◊ï◊ü.: ‚Äé◊ë◊õ◊ö ◊î◊®◊ó◊ô◊ë ◊î◊û◊ó◊ï◊ß◊ß ◊ë◊¶◊ï◊®◊î ◊¢◊ß◊ô◊§◊î ◊ê◊™ ◊™◊ó◊ï◊ú◊™ ◊î◊ê◊ô◊°◊ï◊® ◊î◊ß◊ë◊ï◊¢ ◊ë◊ó◊ï◊ß ◊¢◊ú ◊î◊ê◊ñ◊ï◊®◊ô◊ù. ◊ñ◊ê◊™ ◊ï◊¢◊ï◊ì, ◊ë◊¢◊ë◊® ◊î◊ï◊ó◊ú◊ï ◊î◊ï◊®◊ê◊ï◊™ ◊ó◊ï◊ß ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú◊ô◊ï◊™ ◊©◊ï◊†◊ï◊™, ◊ì◊®◊õ◊î ◊©◊ú ◊™◊ó◊ô◊ß◊™ ◊î◊ë◊ô◊ò◊ó◊ï◊ü ◊î◊ó◊ú◊î ◊ë◊ê◊ñ◊ï◊®◊ô◊ù, ◊ë◊©◊ò◊ó◊ü ◊©◊ú ◊î◊®◊©◊ï◊ô◊ï◊™ ◊î◊û◊ß◊ï◊û◊ô◊ï◊™ ◊î◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú◊ô◊ï◊™ ◊ë◊ê◊ñ◊ï◊®◊ô◊ù )◊î◊ó◊ú◊î ◊ñ◊ï ◊ô◊¶◊®◊î ◊ê◊™ ◊î◊™◊ï◊§◊¢◊î ◊î◊û◊õ◊ï◊†◊î \\"◊û◊©◊§◊ò ◊î◊û◊ï◊ë◊ú◊¢◊ï◊™\\"(. ◊ô◊ï◊ì◊í◊© ◊õ◊ô ◊î◊ó◊ï◊ß◊ô◊ù ◊î◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú◊ô◊ô◊ù ◊©◊î◊ï◊ó◊ú◊ï ◊ë◊ì◊®◊ö ◊ñ◊ï ◊î◊ô◊†◊ù ◊ë◊¢◊ú◊ô ◊¶◊ë◊ô◊ï◊ü ◊§◊®◊°◊ï◊†◊ú◊ô ◊û◊ï◊ë◊î◊ß )◊ì◊ï◊í◊û◊™ ◊†◊ï◊©◊ê◊ô ◊ó◊ô◊†◊ï◊ö, ◊®◊ï◊ï◊ó◊î, ◊ë◊®◊ô◊ê◊ï◊™, ◊¢◊ë◊ï◊ì◊î, ◊û◊¢◊û◊ì ◊ê◊ô◊©◊ô ◊ï◊õ◊ô◊ï\\"◊ë ◊¢◊†◊ô◊ô◊†◊ô◊ù( ◊ï◊ú◊ê ◊ë◊¢◊ú◊ô ◊¶◊ë◊ô◊ï◊ü ◊ò◊®◊ô◊ò◊ï◊®◊ô◊ê◊ú◊ô- ◊ß◊®◊ß◊¢◊ô but exclude laws relating directly to the territory itself such as land and planning laws. The Supreme Court of Israel has ruled that labour laws applied in this way also apply to those Palestinian workers in Israeli settlements due to the \\"significant linkages\\" test and the principle of equality within the settlements.

Rubinstein noted regarding the legal system for the West Bank, that: > once perceived as an 'escrow' under the rules of international law ‚Äì that is > as a trust ‚Äì they have become a 'legal mongrel' and have gradually been > incorporated in practice into the realm of Israel's rule. In a 2009 report authored by Virginia Tilley, the South African Human Sciences Research Council wrote that \\"The outcome of the extraterritorial application of Israeli legislation on a personal basis, combined with the enclave law as described above, is that a settler lives within the framework of the West Bank law only in a very partial way\\".Occupation, colonialism, apartheid?: a re- assessment of Israel's practices in the occupied Palestinian territories under international law, 2009, pages 108‚Äì109 The report then quoted Rubinstein's 1986 Hebrew work: > A resident of Ma‚Äôale Adumim, for instance, is supposedly subject to the > Military Government and to the local Jordanian law, but in fact he lives > according to the laws of Israel both with respect to his personal law and > with respect to the local municipality wherein he lives.

The concept in Israeli courts The concept and application of Israeli law in the West Bank settlements has been described numerous times in Israeli courts. Examples include a 2004 case, Yinon Food Manufacturing and Marketing Ltd v.

Unlike the other two churches, the South Zelenchuksky Church is a simple cross-domed church without beams. The church was renovated at the end of the 19th century, during which a cornice was added under the dome, the walls were plastered, the frescoes were painted over,–ö—É–∑–Ω–µ—Ü–æ–≤ –í. –ê. –ó–æ–¥—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ —Ñ–µ–æ–¥–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π –ê–ª–∞–Ω–∏–∏. –°. 62. the slab flooring was replaced with wooden flooring,–û—Ç—á–µ—Ç –≥–≥. –ù–∞—Ä—ã—à–∫–∏–Ω—ã—Ö, —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ä—à–∏–≤—à–∏—Ö –ø—É—Ç–µ—à–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ –Ω–∞ –ö–∞–≤–∫–∞–∑ (–°–≤–∞–Ω–µ—Ç–∏—é) —Å –∞—Ä—Ö–µ–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Ü–µ–ª—å—é –≤ 1867 –≥–æ–¥—É // –ò–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏—è –ò–º–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –†—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∞—Ä—Ö–µ–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞. ‚Äî –°–ü–±., 1876. ‚Äî –¢.

Additionally, because the church's original doorway was plastered over, a new doorway was built into the church's northern wall.

Because of the renovation, the church is now one of the most studied cross-domed churches in Alanya. Architecture The South Zelenchuksky Church is a three-apse three-nave cross-in-square building based on four square pillars, and plastered with a thin layer of grout. The church is built out of sandstone blocks, with largest of these blocks being on the bottom, the smallest in the middle, and the medium-sized blocks on top. It is possible that the church was covered with flat stone slabs. The outside of the building is 8.5 meters long and 7.75 meters wide, while the inside is 7.7 meters long and 6.16 meters wide. The dome of the building is asymmetrical and has a length of 1.8 meters and a width of 2.7 meters. The northern and central naves of the church have the same width, while the southern nave is much narrower. Differences between this church and similar churches include its arches, which are uneven and are narrower than its pillars, and its vaults, which are shaped differently than most Alanian and Abkhazian architecture. Due to the elevation of the corner compartments of the church, it is believed that the church originally had a curved coating. The church's apses are semi- circular and small, with side apses being nearly the same height as the central one. Each apse has a window with a corbel arch, indicating that this church was built later than most other Alanian churches. Originally, the church's windows were located in its northern and southern walls, however, the windows were plastered over and moved during the church's renovation.

It was built from 1810 to 1811 by James King. It is also known as Mulgoa Cottage; The Cottage, Coxs Cottage, and was formally known as Fern Hill and Estate of Mulgoa before the new house was built. The property remains privately owned and is the oldest house in Australia still in residence. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Aboriginal land The traditional owners of the land now occupied by Cox's Cottage were the Mulgowie people, who became known as the \\"Mulgoa tribe\\".Karskens, 2009, p9 There is a reference to an attack on the Cox property by Aboriginal people in 1814.Sydney Gazette, May 1814. Colonisation Cox's Cottage is part of early colonial land grants and purchases to members of the Cox family in the Mulgoa Valley, south of Penrith, eventually totalling some .Kinhill Stearns, 1983; Bertie 1930, p51 The first of these grants, of , made in 1809 to the infant Edward Cox and confirmed by Governor Macquarie the following year,Watson, 1917 became known as \\"Fernhills\\" or Fernhill. Edward's father, Lieutenant William Cox, is perhaps best known for supervising the construction of the first road over the Blue Mountains in the second half of 1814.Betteridge, 2009 Lt. William Cox sailed to New South Wales on the Minerva in 1799. During his 37 years of residence in the early colony, he made a substantial and enduring contribution to its progress in the fields of public administration, building and agricultural development. The Cox family were remarkable \\"house and garden\\" people. During the middle years of the 19th century, William Cox Sr. was at Clarendon, near Windsor; his eldest son William, lived at Hobartville, Richmond; his sons Henry, George and Edward were to build and occupy their respective houses of Glenmore, Winbourne and Fernhill at Mulgoa. Another son, James, settled in Van Dieman's Land, where he built his own magnificent Clarendon. Around all these houses the Cox families created beautiful gardens.Chippindall/Broadbent, 1979, 2 The Cottage/Mulgoa Cottage or Fernhill was built for Lt. William Cox under the supervision of James King, a retired sergeant of the New South Wales Corps, on land granted to the infant Edward Cox in 1809-10. Surveyor James Meehan apparently sighted boundaries for neighbouring grants from \\"Mr Cox's house\\" in July 1811,Meehan, Field Books and the earliest part of the house - (verandah-less, with jerkin- head gables, intact in the roof space today) - may date from this time.Chippindall/Broadbent, 1979, 3 The house noted by Meehan, probably built -11, is most likely to have been the building known as The Cottage or Cox's Cottage. The farm was well established by 1815 when Mrs Cox prepared for the visit of Governor Macquarie with \\"an excellent cold collation\\". For some time James King, a servant of the Cox family, managed their Mulgoa properties from the site of The Cottage, with the occasional help of William Cox's fourth, fifth and seventh sons, George, Henry and Edward. Between 1821 and 1825 George and Henry Cox lived in turn at The Cottage with their new wives before moving to their own houses in the Mulgoa area. At about this timeChippindall/Broadbent, 1979 says . The Cottage was extended from a simple three room house with jerkin head gabled roof by the addition of another room, at the western end, and an encircling verandah. Adding a verandah was an innovation of architectural significance: the former vernacular English weatherboard box became a colonial bungalow. The cottage was the nucleus of the Mulgoa Settlement and was also the site of religious gatherings before the construction of St. Thomas' Anglican Church nearby. About 1825 Edward Cox, who had been only four years old when he was granted the land, returned from schooling in England.Roxburgh, pp.239-40 In 1827, at the age of 22, he married Jane Maria Brooks and they lived at The Cottage for the next sixteen years.Cox, Jane Maria, \\"Reminiscences\\", B391 By the late 1830s Fernhill, including The Cottage and Lot 2 was described as one of the five principal estates in the Mulgoa Valley.Riley, W E, JRAHS, vol.XXXII, p.251 et al. In 1843 Edward Cox built and moved into a much grander Greek Revival style house, Fernhill, on the hill to the west of The Cottage on the western side of Mulgoa Road. Apparently designed as a two-storey building but built as single storey, possibly by colonial architect Mortimer Lewis, Fernhill was not finished, possibly as a result of the economic recession of the 1840s. Perhaps also as a result of the recession The Cottage and of land were put up for lease. At this time the property was described as: In 1847 a medal was won by Edward CoxAustraliana, November 2008 for wines produced on his property, Fernhill, competing against his brother and neighbour Henry at Glenmore also at Mulgoa and Sir John Jamison at Regentville. Competition in 1847 for the West Cumberland Agricultural Society (now Royal Agricultural Society of NSW) medal for the production of the best wine, was keen. The magnificent diameter, medal by Richard Lamb is a reflection on the status of the prize, possibly engraved by the colony's leading exponent Samuel Clayton, then living close by at Windsor. A case could be made for this medal being amongst the earliest and possibly the grandest of all surviving New South Wales agricultural medals and one of the great objects of Australian silver. Historical archaeologist Judy Birmingham1979, p.158 has listed the literature on wine making that would have been available to the early European settlers of the colony, including William Macarthur's comprehensive Letters on the culture of the vine (1844). She cites William Cox's vineyard at Mulgoa as being planted in 'deep trenches, and their parallel lines can still often be seen clearly as \\"crop marks\\".Birmingham, 1979, p.158 The vineyard terracing on Lot 2 was very evident in 1983 when the Mulgoa Valley Regional Environmental Study was prepared and is still obvious today. It is likely that the vines that produced the medal winning wine in 1847 were grown on Lot 2, since terraces have not been identified on the property now known as Fernhill to the west of Lot 2. In the early 1850s Colonel Godfrey Mundy, aide-de-camp to Governor Fitzroy singled out Fernhill for the way in which the Cox family had manipulated the landscape by removing or thinning eucalypts and retaining the local angophoras, which had more of the appearance of English trees.Mundy, pp.150-151 Edward Cox died in 1863 and the property passed to his oldest son Edward King Cox (1829-1883) of Rawden, Mudgee, who until 1885 operated a noted racehorse stud at The Cottage, producing several famous horses including 1880 Melbourne Cup winner Grand Flaneur.Clibborn, 1926, pp.16, 23 In late 1982 the once-fenced gravesites of Grand Flaneur and famous sire, Yattendon, were no longer evident.Mulgoa Valley RES appendices item C14 The stables behind The Cottage were still evident in 1917.Watson, 1917, p.187 Following the death of Edward King Cox, his third son, Alfred Edward Cox and a J. Blaikie formed a partnership and ran a dairy on the property during the period to 1913.Palmer, 1972 After the Cox family In 1913 the property was sold to Fowler and Baylis of Penrith, then to a Mr Max Lam for a short time. In 1920 it was purchased by H. J. Davey. Mrs Davey and J. Love had a short partnership, then Mrs Davey and Mrs Love ran the dairy farm until about 1969, when Mrs Davey retired to a fibro house she had built to the west of The Cottage. The Cottage was then leased to a Mr Sheehan until 1972. Rescue and revival The Cottage endured years of neglect with the inevitable consequence of the serious deterioration of its fabric. An important step was taken when Miss Valerie Cox made a donation to the National Trust of Australia (NSW): payment was made for the eradication of termites and the boarding up of its windows. The house thus was given some protection, but unfortunately the stone verandah flagging was removed shortly before Mr. Broadbent purchased the house.Chippindall/Broadbent, 1979, 4 The Cottage has been owned by James Broadbent and his family since the 1970s. Dr James Broadbent is a noted architectural and landscape historian who has preserved the house and reconstructed/ recreated the garden to retain the significance of the building and its setting. Broadbent has embarked on a lengthy scheme of restoration. His plan was to work from the outside in: therefore his attention was given firstly to the repair of the verandah and roof. Beautifully sited on a small rise near Mulgoa Creek, The Cottage is one of the earliest and most important colonial houses, and still retains its fine rural setting. It formed the nucleus of the Mulgoa settlement.Proudfoot,1987 It is perhaps the oldest weatherboard house in New South Wales, in proportion and roofline being one of the first early colonial bungalows. It is the oldest building in the Mulgoa/Wallacia Valley, and the oldest surviving of the numerous Cox family houses.  Description  Cox's Cottage Cox's Cottage, dating from 1810 or 1811, is probably the oldest inhabited residence in Australia (other earlier surviving domiciles are now typically run as museums). It is probably also the oldest weatherboard cottage in New South Wales. The cottage is an early colonial bungalow which retains its rural setting and remnants of its original garden (including white cedar trees (Melia azedarach var.australasica) and the striking succulent \\"century plants\\" (Agave americana), both documented as growing here in the mid 19th century). Post 1980 plantings include a number of species typical of Cumberland Plain colonial gardens, such as Bunya Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii) and silky oak (Grevillea robusta).Stuart Read, pers.comm.5/3/2012 It has a rectangular, asymmetrical plan with double pitched roof. Appears to have reached present form by 1820. It was originally shingled but this was replaced by zinc coated roofing tiles.AHC entry for RNE, 1978 The original SHR listing for Cox's Cottage included two ten hectare lots of land, Lots 3 and 4 DP 241971. The Cottage is located on the northern end of Lot 3 and a contemporary home with associated outhouses has been built on Lot 4 DP 241971 to the north and out of sight from the cottage. Mulgoa Creek runs from north to south near the eastern boundary of both Lots 3 and 4. Most of the 20 hectares comprising Lots 3 and 4 is pastoral in appearance. The Cottage is oriented to the north-east and positioned at the end of its ridge (a pattern of development through the immediate area) with views along the creek to the north and over the river flats.Davies, 2007, p2 The still intact historical and visual relationships between Cox's Cottage, St Thomas's Church to the south and Fernhill to the west are important.AHC Lot 2 Lot 2 DP 241971 is an undeveloped lot of adjacent to Cox's Cottage to the north, with its narrow western end fronting onto Mulgoa Road. It is L shaped and extends to the north along the river flats on its eastern boundary. The block generally slopes from Mulgoa Road to the creek with a small rise of saddle near the road. The site features two small dams located on the natural watercourse along the northern boundary which are fed by rain and not by a watercourse.Davies, 2007 Two areas of former vineyard terraces are still evident. Vegetation on the cleared lower flats and the flat area east of Mulgoa Road is mainly pasture species with agricultural weeds including St John's Wort and blackberry in places. Along Mulgoa Creek are remnant native trees interspersed with mature exotic species including English and Japanese elms and privet. Vegetation elsewhere is mostly regenerating rough-barked apple oak (Angophora sp. - e.g. A.intermedia, A.floribunda) and stands of Acacia sp.Musescape, 2009  Condition  As at 28 November 2007, the property is considered likely to contain archaeological evidence relating to the Cox family period of occupation of the area, including possible building sites and orchard locations, for example: *Site of early buildings - large area of ridge to south of the cottage with signs of former buildings from farm and possibly race horse stud; *Site of clay pits, - distinct impression in ground in gully to west of cottage; source of bricks for house; *Site of the vineyard, - distinct impression of many terraces over wide area on slope; *Site of dam/weir, century - possibly marked by vertical timber piling; *Site of former house, - marked by surviving fruit trees; *Possible site of former horse graves, s - no visible remains of graves of \\"Yattendon\\" and 'Grand Flaneur'.s.6.5.4 Mulgoa, p.92 in appendix D, Historical Archaeological Component by Wendy Thorp, 8/1986 in Fox & Associates, Heritage Study of the City of Penrith, Volume 2 - appendices.  Modifications and dates  Cox's Cottage was almost derelict when bought by historian and conservator James Broadbent and his family in the 1970s. He has spent decades carefully conserving the building and its landscape following Burra Charter principles.  Heritage listing  As at 21 May 2010, Cox's Cottage or The Cottage, dating from 1810, is of State significance as one of the oldest weatherboard-clad dwellings in NSW and probably the oldest occupied residence in the country. Located on the early land grant made to the influential Cox family in the Mulgoa Valley, Cox's Cottage is historically significant and rare at a State level for retaining the original pastoral landscape of its immediate surrounds, providing evidence of colonial settlement patterns in the western part of the Cumberland Plain and of early attempts at farming and viticulture in the Sydney region. The property has historical associational significance at a State level through several generations of the Cox family, who were important in the development of agricultural and pastoral industries in the colony of NSW, including William Cox, who supervised the first road over the Blue Mountains. The house is of State aesthetic significance as a relatively intact early Colonial Georgian cottage and its surrounding fields are also of State significance for providing an intact pastoral landscape setting for the Cottage. Cox's Cottage is of social significance at a State level for the esteem in which it is held by heritage organisations and other community groups. Cox's Cottage has research potential at a State level for the tangible evidence of its early nineteenth century heritage fabric including the Cottage building itself and the former vineyard terracing on Lot 2 dating from the first half of the 19th century. The property is considered likely to contain other archaeological evidence relating to the Cox family period of occupation of the area, including possible building sites and orchard locations. Cox's Cottage has rarity significance at a State level as an integral part of one of the most significant cultural landscapes in NSW, namely the Mulgoa Valley landscape which is also associated with Fernhill and St Thomas' Anglican Church. This is a designed landscape which includes historic and existing visual links between the three properties and which demonstrates attempts by early European settlers to manipulate the native vegetation to achieve a particular design outcome. Cox's Cottage is also of State significance as representative of early colonial homesteads and cultural landscapes associated with early farming practices in the western part of the Cumberland Plain. Cox's Cottage was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Cox's Cottage or The Cottage, dating from 1810, is of State significance as one of the oldest weatherboard-clad dwellings in NSW and probably the oldest occupied residence in the country. Located on the early land grant made to the influential Cox family in the Mulgoa Valley, Cox's Cottage is historically significant and rare at a State level for retaining the original pastoral landscape of its immediate surrounds, providing evidence of colonial settlement patterns in the western part of the Cumberland Plain and of early attempts at farming and viticulture in the Sydney region. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The property has historical associational significance at a State level through its strong associations with several generations of the Cox family, who were important in the development of agricultural and pastoral industries in the colony of NSW, including William Cox, who supervised the first road over the Blue Mountains. William and other members of the Cox family were instrumental in developing the Mulgoa Valley and the houses they erected include some of the most significant surviving colonial residences in NSW. The land is considered to have historical associational significance at a State level. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The house is of State aesthetic significance as a relatively intact colonial cottage, thought to be the oldest weatherboard-clad dwelling in Australia and probably the oldest occupied residence in the country. Its surrounding fields are also of State significance for providing an intact pastoral landscape setting for The Cottage. This cultural landscape remains substantially intact unlike the settings of many other colonial homesteads on the Cumberland Plain. The land also has potential local natural heritage significance since it includes remnant riparian vegetation (albeit with a species composition that includes a number of exotic species, including weeds), that is part of a wildlife corridor along Mulgoa Creek which may be the last of western Sydney's waterways to remain in a natural, largely undisturbed state. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Cox's Cottage is of social significance at a State level for the esteem in which it is held by heritage organisations and other community groups including the Australian Garden History Society and National Trust of Australia (NSW)) as well as the locally based Mulgoa Progress Association and Mulgoa Valley Landcare Group. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Cox's Cottage has research potential at a State level for the tangible evidence of its early nineteenth century heritage fabric including The Cottage and the former vineyard terracing on Lot 2 dating from the first half of the 19th century. The property is considered likely to contain other archaeological evidence relating to the Cox family period of occupation of the area, including possible building sites and orchard locations. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Cox's Cottage has rarity value at a State level as an integral part of one of the most significant cultural landscapes in NSW, namely the Mulgoa Valley landscape which is also associated with Fernhill and St Thomas' Anglican Church. This is a designed landscape which includes historic and existing visual links between the three properties and which demonstrates attempts by early European settlers to manipulate the native vegetation to achieve a particular design outcome. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.

Giorgio Vasari's biography of Uccello states that he had \\"a daughter who knew how to draw.\\"Vasari, Giorgio (1550). Le Vite de'Piu Eccellenti Pittori, Scultori ed Architettori, I, ed. P. Barocchi , Florence: Sansoni, p. 72 Antonia was recorded in the Libro dei Morti (Book of the Dead) of the painter's guild, Arte dei Medici e Speziali, as a \\"pittoressa.\\"Vasari, Le Vite II, ed.

Life Antonia was born to Paolo di Dono and his wife Tomasa di Benedetto dei Malifici on Via della Scala in Florence.Hudson, Hugh (2008). Paolo Uccello: Artist of the Florentine Renaissance Republic, Saarbrucken: VDM Verlag Dr. Mueller, pp. 7-8, 21, 23, 189-190, 239. She was baptized in the Florence Baptistery on October 13, 1456.Opera di Santa Maria del Fiore online, Registro 1, fol. 311 Her grandfather, a barber-surgeon, had immigrated from Pratovecchio and was of middle social status whereas her grandmother belonged to the old Florentine del Beccuto family. Following custom, Antonia was named for her grandmother. Her brother Donato was also an artist and both of them continued in the family tradition.Rizzo, Anna Padoa (1991). Paolo Uccello: catalogo completo dei dipinti. Florence, 1991, pp. 128, 132. Around the age of 10‚Äì13 (1466‚Äì1469) she probably left home to join a Carmelite religious community. Her father's 1469 tax return declared that he was old, could not work, and his wife was sick. His testament in 1475 does not mention his daughter Antonia or any convent donations.Hudson, Uccello, p. 313 She may not have been an enclosed nun when he died. The Florentine Carmelites began with pious women living near the church of Santa Maria del Carmine. As the community grew, the prior went to Rome and asked Pope Nicholas V for permission to have Carmelite sisters. The Pope licensed the female branch of the Carmelites in 1452.https://maddalenadepazzi.jimdo.com/english-spanish/the- community-of-florence/ [retrieved January 15, 2018] Santa Maria degli Angeli (on the site of San Frediano in Cestello) was founded c. 1450‚Äì1460, and the smaller Nunziatina house appeared in May 1453.Paatz (1952). Die Kirchen von Florenz, II, p. 145-146; IV, p.401. Richa, Le Chiese, (1761) IX, pp. 113‚Äì117. The women worked and prayed together, attending religious services at the Carmine, but were not yet subject to enclosure.Vasciaveo, C. (2013). Una Storia di Donne, Rome: Carmelite Order, pp. 19-24. Between 1479 and 1482 they were granted the scapular and adopted the enclosed lifestyle.Paatz, Die Kirchen von Florenz, II, p. 145. Therefore, Antonia entered a Carmelite tertiary or lay sisters community by 1469 and became an enclosed nun in the last decade of her life (c. 1482‚Äì1491). According to the Libro dei Morti, she died February 9, 1491. Works There are no known signed or documented artworks by Antonia. Several small-scale devotional paintings from Paolo Uccello's workshop have been attributed to her when she was identified as the \\"Karlsruhe Master,\\" but most scholars now reject this hypothesis.Fredericksen, Burton B. (1972) Catalogue of Paintings in the J. Paul Getty Museum https://books.google.com/books?id=chdHAgAAQBAJ&printsec;=frontcover#v=onepage&q;=Uccello&f;=false [retrieved January 14, 2018] These include the Adoration (Karlsruhe, Germany), the Hyland Madonna, dated 1470‚Äì1475 (The J. Paul Getty Museum, Malibu), the Thebaid (Academy Gallery, Florence), and a predella from the Beata Giulia of Certaldo Altarpiece (Museum of Sacred Art, Church of Saints Jacopo and Filippo, Certaldo).On the Beata Giulia Altarpiece, see Parronchi, p. 27. It was believed lost, but see Allegri, Tosi, Hollander, Certaldo: Posie del Medievo: Alla scoperta delle chiese, delle Torre, e dei Palazzi nel Paese di Giovanni Boccaccio (Certaldo, 2002), pp. 54‚Äì55. The miniature \\"Vestition of Novices from the Vecchietti Family\\" from San Donato Polverosa, Florence (Uffizi Gallery, Florence) was thought to have Antonia's signature, but it is now recognized as the pledge of profession for a Benedictine nun in 1501.Marini, Marino (1997). \\"Il Monastero di San Donato Polverosa (Fi) fra Medievo e Rinascimento. Fonti Storiche e Archeologiche\\" La Columbaria¬∏ LXII, 1997, pp. 87‚Äì127. So far, the most reasonable hypothesis is that she helped her father after he closed his workshop in 1469‚Äì1475. She likely supplied drawings of small figures of saints, clothing details, or animals for Uccello's later cassoni and after his death continued to provide drawings to other cassoni furniture workshops. Her art was collaborative and created in support of male artists, but she was sufficiently well known to have been publicly recognized as a woman painter.

It was built from 1821 to 1890. It is also known as Fairlight Homestead & Barn. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Norton family have a history over many centuries in the County of Sussex, England, as owners of considerable landed property.Bertie, 1933, 40 James Norton was born in the mid 1700s at Hurstpierpont in County Sussex, England on the family estate Northend.Cox Tanner P/L, 1981, 2 He resided on that estate (one of his estates) marrying Rebecca Steel, of Newtimber, by whom he had one son and two daughters. His only son John and his (second) wife Mary had 10 children. Nathaniel, their second son, like eldest brother, John (born , also served in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars, fighting against the French. Nathaniel's last ship was the 74 gun battleship HMS Tigre and in 1815, following the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo and the end of the wars, HMS Tigre was paid off and Nathaniel retired from the Navy on half pay before he departed for New South Wales. The third son, James, had apparently qualified as a solicitor before he left England. He emigrated to Australia in 1818 and commenced practice as a solicitor, only to be followed the next year by his father John, his brother Lieutenant Nathaniel and three of his sisters, all of whom arrived in Sydney aboard the Harriet on 8 February 1819. One of the sisters, Emma, was to marry John Oxley the Surveyor General of NSW and leader of several successful journeys of exploration. James Norton the solicitor enjoyed an extensive practice in which he continued to be active for over 40 years. Three Government grants were made on 5 April 1821 - Northend of to James, Fairlight of to Nathaniel, and Grovers of to their father John in the Bringelly district. Norton's Basin on the Nepean River is named after John Norton. Later the family acquired an extensive estate in the Kanimbla Valley in the heart of the Blue Mountains, where they carried on agriculture and stock breeding for many years. A house was built at Fairlight and the whole family moved in late 1821, while the three grants were managed as one from Fairlight by Nathaniel.Cox Tanner P/L, 1981, 1 The original homestead of Fairlight was built .Davies, 2014, 142 James continued to practise as a solicitor in the Leichhardt area and never took up residence on his own estate, and the father John, moved to a grant made later in the Kanimbla Valley.Norrie, 1990, 131-3 John Norton, with his younger son, James after a few years, moved down to the Kanimbla Valley to a large property on the Cox's River, leaving Nathaniel in possession of the Mulgoa grants, which henceforth became known under the name of Fairlight. In 1821, the first house was built of slabs, plastered with clay, whitewashed, originally shingle-rooved. It had two wings, each with two rooms. According to the style of the period the rooms were only high, and the doors , a tall man having to stoop to enter. Nathaniel, a bachelor, lived with one of his sisters as housekeeper until he married Ellen Barber in 1841. He died in 1851 aged 66 years, and Ellen died some 15 months later. William Arthur Helleyer, a Sydney solicitor, bought Fairlight after Nathaniel's death (in 1863) and the property was eventually successfully managed by his son. Mrs Helleyer wrote in 1869 \\"We have lovely fruit growing there, all kinds, also two vineyards and made wine. We were overrun with deer belonging to our neighbour, Mr E. King Cox, which was a great annoyance to us...\\". The vineyard at Fairlight flourished with a large stone wine cellar, which recently was demolished by developers, being built opposite the house. A photograph of the original house, a windmill on the estate and a sample wine label from the Helleyer days are shown.See pictures p.132, NB: annotation on windmill photo notes it was cut down c.1912; the wine label annotation notes it was used on bottles from Fairlight's vineyards under Helleyer, 1869-76 Other photographs on p. 133 show the winery, noting its use of gravity - with its construction running down the slope; the barn and a domed pig feeder structure). Snakes, bushfires and poor road access made the property less desirable than one would imagine and eventually Mr Helleyer sold out to Mr W. Jarret, who overdeveloped the estate. He built a new homestead, large stables, meat-curing rooms, fruit-drying lofts and a large building of four-storeys to store wine. Overcapitalised, he was forced to sell up. William Jarret was a gentleman well known in Sydney business circles during the last years of the past (19th) century. When he took up the property he appears to have seen its great value as a wine making place, and all the improvements about the place were the outcome of the 20,000 pounds he spent on it. When he took it over, in addition to the old homestead, there was an old stone wine cellar, a post windmill, which was almost intact five years ago, but only the post in the well now remains, and a wooden store for wine in casks, built up against a cutting in the side of a hill. This latter, in Jarret's time, was removed, and in its place a four-storied solid brick building was put up. Next to this, and also of brick, was a dairy and creamery, with men's' quarters and kitchens, and a large room overhead 70' x 30' for what purpose it is difficult to say, iron bars with running hooks from side to side, indicate some kind of industry on an extensive scale was carried on, which none of the villagers have now any knowledge of. Machinery of various sorts, some still standing, show that Fairlight, a quarter of a century ago, was a busy place. The structure described as a 'dairy and creamery, with men's' quarters and kitchens, and a large room overhead' is the subject of this report.Cox Tanner P/L, (barn restoration) 1981, 1-2. Davies (2014, 142) says the current Fairlight house was built at the time of Jarrett's purchase in 1876. the homestead was replaced by a substantial single storey brick dwelling, and the barn modified to provide a large workroom or dormitory on the upper level. In 1914 the owner was Mr A. G. Witts.Cox Tanner P/L, 1981 Hassall in his book \\"In Old Australia\\" says of his school days at Mulgoa rectory about 1837; \\"About two miles from the school lived Nathaniel Norton, brother of James Norton senior, solicitor and uncle to the Oxleys. He was an old naval man, a good hearted sailor, whom boys were fond of visiting.\\" The owners imagine he sat under the Port Jackson fig (Ficus rubiginosa). trees and took in the best views in the County of Cumberland. In 1821 Macquarie gave grants of land, to Nathaniel, James and John Norton. The original house stood beside the Port Jackson figs, remnants of the original garden including a row of cabbage palms (Livistona australis) and a clump of bamboo (which may be seen beside the driveway). The present house and barn were built by Jarrett in the late 1860s and there are a number of trees that may have been part of his garden, such as the carob (Ceratonia siliqua), kurrajong (Brachychiton populneum) and turpentine (Syncarpia glomulifera). Since the garden was last opened in 1993 the dry stone wall has been extended and now envelopes the westerly aspect of the garden. The wall was built by a local stonemason, George Progmelja. The garden was severely disturbed on 25 December 2001 when strong, hot, westerly winds fanned fires in the Blue Mountains which leapt over the Nepean River and came swiftly to this area. Three houses were destroyed, fruit orchards and packing sheds felt the wrath but fortunately there were no fatalities. Fairlight was saved by the local fire brigade and the owner's sons. The garden on the western side near the pool was totally destroyed, as was the hedge on the fence line near the barn and other areas of hedging. The ancient hedge of Cape Honeysuckle under the Angophora floribunda in front of the house, woody and always in need of a good prune, vanished and has given a new perspective now with glimpses down the paddock to the Blue Mountains. It is taking time for the Angophora floribundas to recover but has given the owners the chance to simplify the planting. Following the fires, a severe wind storm came through in September 2003 and trees weakened by the fires came down as did huge limbs from the Port Jackson figs and Angophoras.From the owner, 10/2004  Description  The site is a very elevated one, with views across rolling landscapes to Sydney, the Nepean (River) gorge and to Camden and Mittagong. Two articles by Captain J. H. Watson in the Nepean Times of 24 and 31 October 1914 provide an account of the property: The original homestead was a single storeyed building not unlike Cox's Cottage, Mulgoa or Clarendon, Richmond. At its rear a large barn was constructed. the homestead was replaced by a substantial single storeyed brick dwelling, and the barn modified to provide a large workroom or dormitory on the upper level. Hassall in his book \\"In Old Australia\\" says of his school days at Mulgoa rectory about 1837; \\"About two miles from the school lived Nathaniel Norton, brother of James Norton senior, solicitor and uncle to the Oxleys. He was an old naval man, a good hearted sailor, whom boys were fond of visiting.\\" The owners imagine he sat under the Port Jackson fig (Ficus macrophylla) trees and took in the best views in the County of Cumberland. In 1821 Macquarie gave grants of land, to Nathaniel, James and John Norton. The original house stood beside the Port Jackson figs, remnants of the original garden including a row of cabbage palms (Livistona australis) and a clump of bamboo (which may be seen beside the driveway). The present house and barn were built by Jarrett in the late 1860s and there are a number of trees that may have been part of his garden, such as the carob (Ceratonia siliqua), kurrajong (Brachychiton populneum) and turpentine (Syncarpia glomulifera). The present garden has been grafted on to these remnants. The line of Chinese elms (Ulmus parvifolia) forming the drive to the east of the house mark part of the original driveway. To the west, a rose walk (Rosa x \\"White Spray\\" and 'Iceberg') links the house with the tennis court and pool and incorporates an old Bougainvillea and quince (Cydonia oblonga) tree. The majestic Port Jackson fig trees frame the south vista. Adjacent is the orchard and vegetable garden. Since the garden was last opened in 1993 the dry stone wall has been extended and now envelopes the westerly aspect of the garden. The wall was built by a local stonemason, George Progmelja, whose craft had been handed down by his father, brought up in Serbia, where houses and dry stone walls are common in rural areas. The owners have planted Bunya Bunya trees in the paddocks, a tree they neglected to plant in bygone days, but somehow essential in this setting. Glimpses of the Blue Mountains and the Nepean Gorge can be seen through the rough barked apple gum (Angophora subvelutina / A.floribunda / A.intermedia). This tranquil garden was severely disturbed on 25 December 2001 when strong, hot, westerly winds fanned fires in the Blue Mountains which leapt over the Nepean River and came swiftly to this area. Three houses were destroyed, fruit orchards and packing sheds felt the wrath but fortunately there were no fatalities. \\"Fairlight\\" was saved by the local fire brigade and the owner's sons. The garden on the western side near the pool was totally destroyed, as was the hedge on the fence line near the barn and other areas of hedging. The ancient hedge of Cape honeysuckle (Tecomaria capensis) under the Angophora floribunda in front of the house, woody and always in need of a good prune, vanished and has given a new perspective now with glimpses down the paddock to the Blue Mountains. It is taking time for the Angophora floribundas to recover but has given the owners the chance to simplify the planting. Following the fires, a severe wind storm came through in September 2003 and trees weakened by the fires came down as did huge limbs from the Port Jackson figs and Angophoras. The property is now facing lack of rain - the last good rain was in February 2004. Currently dam levels are dropping so the owners are applying lots of mulch, being cautious with watering.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. As of 2018, the space houses the Fire Historical and Cultural Arts Collaborative. History Kalamazoo grew rapidly at the end of the nineteenth century; in particular, southeastern part of Kalamazoo near Washington Square experienced rapid growth after a series of large paper mills opened nearby between 1890 and 1900. However, the area lacked adequate fire coverage. In 1903, the city council hired Kalamazoo architect Robert M. Gallup to draft plans for a new fire station. After some revision, local contractor Moore McQuigg was hired to construct the building. The station was completed in mid-1904. The station, called \\"Engine House No. 2,\\" was used by the city until 1953 when a new fire station was constructed nearby. The building housed a laundromat until about 1976. However, the building becamee severely deteriorated. It was purchased by a new owner in 1982 and rehabilitated to house a contracting business in the first floor and office space upstairs. As of 2018, the space houses the Fire Historical and Cultural Arts Collaborative. Description The Portage Street Fire Station is a two-story orange brick structure, trimmed with yellow-gray, rock-face limestone, with a hip-and gable roof containing a total of five dormers. It measures 40 feet by 60 feet. It stands on a corner lot; attached to the building corner nearest the intersection is a pyramid-roof tower, projecting outside the footprint of the building proper. All of the building windows are one-over-one double hung units. The front facade has arched fire-door openings on the first floor.

An ancient Roman Road, it was once one of the major routes into Norwich city centre, since the 12th century. The street now exists as a fragmented row of historical buildings and post-war industrial buildings as a result of 1960s slum clearance and Second World War bomb damage. History Ber Street Gate was first mentioned in 1146 AD, and it was built on a corner of the city wall which runs southeast and southwest from the gate. The gate itself was demolished in 1808 but the street remained busy and densely populated. It was known locally as \\"Blood and Guts Street\\", due to its many slaughterhouses and butcher shops, and because cattle was driven down the road into the city.  Richmond Hill  The area between Ber Street and King Street was densely populated from the 1840s onwards. It consisted of many yards and courts leading off Ber Street. Known locally as the Village on the Hill, three main roads, Mariners Lane, Horns Lane and Thorn Lane lead into the district. It became the settlement for a small Italian community, who later set up Vallori's Ice Cream. In 1960, the district was condemned as slums, and many residents were forced to leave due to compulsory purchase orders on the old terraces and lanes. The whole borough was demolished, which consisted of around 56 acres of existing streets, including 833 dwellings (612 considered unfit for human habitation), 42 shops, 4 offices, 22 public houses and 2 schools. Communities were moved to high rise buildings such as Normandy Tower, or new housing estates such as the Tuckswood Estate, that were being built around the city at the time. A new road, Rouen Road was developed in the area's place in 1962, which consists mainly of light industrial units and council flats. Ber Street had its whole eastern side demolished. Low rise council housing was built in 1967-8.  Present day  The street currently houses some light industrial units, and one public house, The Berstrete Gates. A small cafe has recently opened, The Ber Street kitchen. Various schemes have been proposed to reinstate the eastern side of the street, and make it part of the city centre once again.

The emblem was originally designed in 1916 for the then United Provinces of Agra and Oudh and continued in use following Indian Independence in 1947.  History  In the second half of the 18th century the autonomous princes clashed with the English East India Company, expanding from Calcutta into the valley of the Ganges. One after the other had to recognize the sovereignty of the Company. In 1816 Awadh (Oudh) had to accept a British protectorate. In 1835 all of the territory of modern Uttar Pradesh came, as ‚ÄúNorth-Western Provinces‚Äù, under British rule. In 1856 the last nawab of Awadh was deposed and his empire placed under direct British rule. In 1902 the North-Western Provinces were renamed ‚ÄúUnited Provinces of Agra and Oudh‚Äù. In 1935 the name was changed into ‚ÄúUnited Provinces‚Äù and after independence into Uttar Pradesh. With the last change the enclave-states of Benares, Rampur and Tehri Garhwal were incorporated and in the south parts of Samthar and Charkari, princely states formerly belonging to the Central Provinces. The state emblem probably dates from the time when it was known as United Provinces. The state emblem of Uttar Pradesh owes its origin to the Royal Society in the United Kingdom, which approved the symbol in 1916. The 'Coat of Arms' adorning all UP government files, letterheads and vehicles and other government stationery, including its publications using it as seal, has an underlined idea. Unveiling this quite an unknown idea first suggested by Mr Baker, assistant director of UP state archives, Dr Sandhya Nagar, says the combination of a \\"pair of fish and the arrow-bow, embellished with three waves stresses on 'Unity in diversity'. Dr Nagar said the symbolism attached with each of these characters marked their presence in the logo, the pair of fish with the Muslim rulers of Oudh while the bow and arrow identifying Hindu Lord Ram while the waves marked the confluence of the rivers Ganga-Yamuna. The proposed logo also contained a star at the bottom, which was deleted later. \\"The symbol is a vivid representation of geographical, historical and cultural integrity of Uttar Pradesh,\\" Dr Nagar said.  Design  The emblem consists of a circular seal depicting the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers at Prayagraj, a pair of Matsya fish to represent the state of Oudh (Awadh) and a pair of Bow and Arrow representing the Budelkhand area. The legend around the seal translates as \\"Government of Uttar Pradesh\\". Government banner The Government of Uttar Pradesh can be represented by a banner displaying the emblem of the state on a white field.https://www.dreamstime.com/uttar-pradesh- state-india-flag-textile-cloth-fabric-waving-top-sunrise-mist-fog-beautiful- uttar-pradesh-state-india-image127909984http://www.vexilla- mundi.com/india_governments_b.html File:..Uttar Pradesh Flag(INDIA).png|Banner of Uttar Pradesh See also * National Emblem of India * List of Indian state emblems References External links * Government of Uttar Pradesh *What is the meaning of the Emblem of Uttar Pradesh Government of Uttar Pradesh Uttar Pradesh Symbols of Uttar Pradesh ","title":"Emblem of Uttar Pradesh"},{"id":"58758537","text":"\\"Tegridy Farms\\" is the fourth episode of the twenty-second season of the American animated television series South Park. The 291st overall episode of the series, it aired on Comedy Central in the United States on October 17, 2018. The episode parodies the popularity of vaping, its increased use by children, and the legalized use of marijuana in Colorado. Plot Randy and Sharon Marsh are called in to Mr. Mackey's office because their daughter Shelly has been texting inappropriate pictures to the recess monitor so that she can get away with vaping during recess. Frustrated with the recent issues in South Park including events over the previous three episodes, Randy convinces Sharon to sell their home and move out to a cannabis farm Randy names Tegridy Farms, where he harvests the plant and manufactures a variety of products from hemp. Randy meets an agricultural inspector who will authorize him to sell his marijuana, who turns out to be Towelie who personally samples the various strains of marijuana. Randy is later visited by a representative of a vape manufacturer called Big Vape Colorado who wants to add Randy's product to their line, but Randy angrily refuses, not wanting to be associated at all with vaping. Kyle Broflovski discovers that his brother Ike and his kindergarten classmates are also vaping. Kyle, Stan Marsh, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick discover that Butters Stotch is the person selling vaping pens and accessories to the children, and Cartman punches him for doing so. Later, Butters confronts Cartman for this act in a restroom, where it is revealed that he and Cartman are partners in this venture. Kyle overhears their conversation, and attempts to report Butters and Cartman to the principal, but Cartman begs Kyle to let them continue selling until they get out of debt for the products they already purchased. Kyle agrees on the condition that Cartman promise to stop marketing to kindergartners but Cartman nonetheless has a costumed mascot named Vaping Man crash through the cafeteria wall in the style of the Kool-Aid Man to boost sales among young children, much to Kyle's outrage. Cartman and Butters introduce Kyle to their dealer outside the Big Vape Colorado where he has just purchased his supplies, but then implicate the two of them by beating the dealer and planting a dead prostitute's body near the both of them before stealing the dealer's cash and vape products. Kyle goes to Mr. Mackey's house to ask for help, but Butters and Cartman are already there. Pulling Kyle aside, they tell Kyle that the sixth graders are angry at all of them for attacking their vape supplier, and that the only solution is to rob the vape store to appease the original dealer, who is revealed to be Vaping Man. Angered that his neighbor Joe has sold his farm to Big Vape, and further outraged that his son Stan was caught with a vaping pen at school, Randy goes to a Big Vape Colorado store and attacks the patrons there. Kyle, Butters and Cartman steal the store's vape juice, only to be confronted by the Big Vape Colorado representative. After Kyle discloses the details of Big Vape Colorado's involvement in the vaping epidemic at the school, the representative attacks Randy, but Towelie assists Randy in dispatching the representative. Randy starts to vaporize all of the large tanks of vape juice before lighting a marijuana cigarette and tossing it inside, causing the building to explode. Back at the farm, he celebrates with Towelie as Stan sadly realizes that this farm lifestyle will continue. Reception Jesse Schedeen with IGN rated the episode a 9.2 out of 10 and summarized in his review, \\"'Tegridy Farms' is easily one of the best South Park episodes in several years, in large part because it captures so much of what made the show stand out in its earlier seasons. It features a healthy sprinkling of topical humor but a ridiculous storyline that can hold up over time. It also banks heavily on the appeal of Randy without completely ignoring the younger characters.\\" Joe Matar with Den of Geek rated the episode two out of five stars, and stated in his review, \\"There's nothing particularly wrong with the plot of 'Tegridy Farms.' It makes enough sense and sticks to one topic. It's just so inconsequential and aimless that it's difficult to care about any of it. The greater sin is how, like the rest of Season 22 so far, it's almost uniformly unfunny.\\" John Hugar with The A.V. Club gave the episode an A grade and opened his review stating, \\"I'll be honest, while I appreciate South Park's earnest social commentaries, as well as their desire to atone for the negative effect the show's early years might have had on society, ultimately, this show is at its best when it just focuses all of its energy on telling jokes and making fun of shit, which was certainly the case tonight.\\" References External links *\\"Episode 2204 'Tegridy Farms' Press Release\\".

Marie Stewart has written: \\"Until the age of 11 when his father died, Namba Roy had his father, his uncle and his grandfather as tutors in the traditions of his people.

These subjects were predominantly Christian, presenting the Child Jesus and His Mother as coloured, identifying his people with God‚Äîrefusing to subscribe to a colour bar of the spirit.\\" Roy himself noted in an article in The Guardian: \\"It was Sir Jacob Epstein himself who pointed out to me the similarity of the head and torso of the ivory-carved Christ in my 'Crucifixion' to his colossal and magnificent 'Ecce Homo.' The same out-of-proportion head in contrast to the torso. I had not realised it before and was a little embarrassed until I saw the look of pleasure on the face of this great man.\\"Namba Roy, \\"So grows the head\\", The Guardian, 13 October 1960. Roy's novel Black Albino was published in 1961, with a foreword by Tom Driberg, who described the story as an \\"inverted parable of colour prejudice\\". It drew on 18th-century Maroon history, although as well as using information handed down by his own family Roy also conducted research in the British Museum. While Black Albino has primarily been discussed only in relation to evidence of Africa in the Caribbean, and has received limited and variable critical attention (including from O. R. Dathorne and Kamau Brathwaite), Mervyn Morris in a 1984 article in Jamaica Journal concluded: \\"But the success, the value, of this book does not primarily reside in its fidelity to history, its recording of African culture in the Caribbean, nor in such patterns, meanings, literary effects as may be less than obvious. Primarily it works ‚Äì works well ‚Äì as an adventure story with boldly drawn characters and a clear-cur morality. Apparently under-edited, the writing is a little clumsy here and there.

He was the first Italian male protagonist in Italian cinema performing non-simulated sex on screen and has been called the first Italian \\"pornodivo\\".  Early life  Mark Shannon was born as Manlio Cersosimo in Rome on December 8, 1939, the son of Vincenzo Cersosimo, a known magistrate and criminal lawyer. He worked at the exchange office of the Bank of Italy from 1965 to 1975 and as a tourist guide. Film career (1979-1988) Shannon already appeared in a small role in Vino, whisky e acqua salata (1962), but started his film career starring in Roberto Mauri's Le porno killers (alongside Carmen Russo) and in Joe D'Amato's Caribbean films Porno Holocaust, Erotic Nights of the Living Dead, Hard Sensation, and Sesso nero, all shot in the second half of 1979 and released in 1980 and 1981. During his film career, he kept working as travel agency correspondent. From 1979 to 1981, he was stationed in Tanzania and only acted in films during breaks, which usually lasted about three months. Shannon continued to star in many films by Joe D'Amato, but also of Mario Bianchi, Antonio D'Agostino, Sergio Bergonzelli and Claudio Bernabei, until 1983. He had scenes with many notable Italian pornographic actresses, among them Lucia Ramirez, Annj Goren, Laura Gemser, Ajita Wilson, Marina Frajese, and Moana Pozzi. Already during, but mostly after Shannon's active period, many of his scenes were reused in other adult productions. Later life and death From 1984 to 1988, Shannon was correspondent for \\"International Travel Dixie Bird\\", after which he returned to Italy, working in tourism until 2004. Shannon occasionally appeared in cameo roles on Italian television and made a last appearance in a film made for theatrical distribution, Giovanni Veronesi's L'ultima ruota del carro (2013). For the blu-ray Erotic Nights of the Living Dead released by Code Red on June 15, 2018 in the United States, Mark Shannon gave a 20-minute interview in which he talked about his experiences as hardcore pornographic actor and how they came to affect his life both during his active time and beyond.

The museum contains the paintings and personal object of one of the most famous Serbian painters, Paja Jovanoviƒá. History It is not known when Paja Jovanoviƒá (Vr≈°ac, 1859 ‚Äì Vienna, 1957) first visited Belgrade. It is reasonable to guess that it might have happened during his visits to the hometown, Vr≈°ac, or on his travels to the southern parts of Serbia in the closing decades of the 19th century. Although he never spent much time in Belgrade due to his painting commitments all over the globe, it remained a place to which he eagerly returned. After the plan to build an art studio for him in Belgrade had been abandoned with the break-out of World War II, in 1950, Paja Jovanoviƒá started a correspondence with the officials of the Belgrade City Museum about establishing his legacy in Belgrade. He wanted to bequeath to the City the pieces of his work and items of his painting equipment that he considered ‚Äúworth preserving‚Äù, so that a studio could be set up ‚Äì the master‚Äôs room attracting those who would like to learn something more about him and his art. The legacy of Paja Jovanoviƒá, including more than 800 objects, was handed over to the Belgrade City Museum in 1952. In compliance with the artist‚Äôs wish, after his death in Vienna on 30 November 1957, the urn with his remains was also delivered to the museum. Just as he wished, it was buried at the Alley of Meritorious Citizens at the Novo Groblje Cemetery in Belgrade on 11 June 1970, on the same day when the Belgrade City Museum fulfilled the painter‚Äôs second wish by opening to public the Museum of Paja Jovanoviƒá. In 1972, the collection was extended by the gift of the painter‚Äôs wife Hermina ‚Äì M√∂uny Dauber. She bequeathed to the Belgrade City Museum eleven paintings by Paja Jovanoviƒá from her private collection and a number of pieces of antique furniture.

Only a single prototype was built, which crashed on landing from its first flight, killing the pilot. The Bl√©riot 74, Bl√©riot 75 and Bl√©riot 76, respectively, a heavy bomber / airliner, airliner and heavy bomber, directly evolved mfrom the Bl√©riot 71 / Bl√©riot 73 bombers. Design and development Bl√©riot 73 The Bl√©riot 73 was a large equal-span biplane with a fuselage suspended from the lower wing and bearing a resemblance to, and slightly larger than, the Bl√©riot 71, with the exception of the flying-boat like fuselage, attached beneath the lower mainplane, sweeping elegantly upwards to the biplane tail unit with twin rudders.. Four Hispano-Suiza 8Fb water-cooled V-8 engines were mounted as close to the centreline as possible, two on the upper wing leading edge and two on the lower wing. The fixed landing gear had two twin wheel- wheel units, with large track, on struts and no tailskid. During flight testing the Bl 73 disintegrated on 22 January 1919, killing the pilot: One prototype built. Bl√©riot 74 After the poor performance and crash of the Bl√©riot 73, Touillet developed a heavy bomber come airliner with a large rounded biconvex fuselage sitting above the lower wing. The wings were virtually identical with those of the Bl√©riot 73, again with four Hispano- Suiza 8Fb engines grouped around the fuselage. Flight testing at Villacoubly was abruptly terminated on 22 January 1920 when oscillations in the tail unit resulted in structural failure and the fatal crash of the sole Bl√©riot 74: One prototype built.  Bl√©riot 75 Aerobus The airliner version of the Bl√©riot 74 had a new wing with dihedral on both upper and lower mainplanes, a longer rear fuselage and enlarged vertical tail surface. Despite promising flight- test results of the sole Bl√©riot 75, the design did not attract any orders: One prototype built.  Bl√©riot 76 Designed for the wartime BN4 specification the Bl√©riot 76 bomber followed the same configuration as the previous members of the Bl√©riot 73 family, but had the lower Hispano-Suiza 8Fb engines further outboard than the upper Hispano-Suiza 8Fb engines, slightly swept-back wings and a pair of very large mainwheels: Design only, not built.

Early life and education  Christine Guthrie was born in Brooklyn, New York. She received a BS in Zoology from University of Michigan and a PhD in genetics from University of Wisconsin. Her PhD advisor was Masayasu Nomura. She is the daughter of Brooklyn native and humorist Irene Kampen, whose book, Life Without George, was the basis for The Lucy Show, which aired for six seasons on CBS in the 1960s. (Lucy's daughter on the show was named Chris.)  Academic career  In 1973, she was hired as an Assistant Professor at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). After a tough pre-tenure review in 1976, she found support in a group of women and men who met informally for 20 years to help each other thrive in academia.Ellen Daniell 2008 Every Other Thursday: Stories and Strategies from Successful Women Scientists Yale University Press, New Haven, CT. She is now professor of biochemistry and American Cancer Society Research Professor of Genetics at UCSF. Scanning Electron Micrograph of Yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae  Research  Guthrie showed that yeast have introns in their pre-messenger RNAs. They also have small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) involved in splicing pre- messenger RNA into messenger RNA in eukaryotic cells. 2 In work described in her citation for the Genetics Society of America Medal as a ‚Äúmacromolecular tour de force‚Äù, she cloned and sequenced the SNR genes for the yeast snRNAs. To accomplish this feat, she had to invent methods to discriminate functional snRNAs from degradation products and also to create widely used intron- containing reporter genes. Her work established the role of base pairing between the snRNAs and their target sequences at each step in the removal of an intron and allowed identification of proteins that formed part of the spliceosome complex with the snRNAs.

The station room for passenger service was insufficient. The building was designed to stay 700 passengers per day, but sometimes more than 1500 people used this station per day. The approach to the trains was carried out directly through the tracks, which, while simultaneously stopping several trains, created inconveniences. The project for the reconstruction of the station was sent to the Ministry of Railways in 1956, but this issue was not implemented. In 1963, the reconstruction of the station began, completed by 1966. The main station building was built a reinforced concrete two-story building in the style of functionalism. An underground pedestrian to go to platforms was built. In March 2000, reconstruction of building was begun, completed in 2007 - the two- story building was turned into a three-story building. As a result of the reconstruction, the building acquired a new architectural look - in the style of Russian modern. Reconstruction of the station complex cost more than 670 million rubles. Ten thousand people can use new station, and almost three million passengers a year.

(January 3, 1999) * 1999 On January 8, a leak in a 12-inch pipe at a Koch Industries tank farm in Benavides County, Texas spilled about 10,500 barrels of crude oil. The cause was internal corrosion of the pipe. * 1999 In Bridgeport, Alabama, on January 22, while digging a trench behind a building, a backhoe operator damaged a 3/4-inch steel natural gas service line and a 1-inch water service line. This resulted in two leaks in the natural gas service line, which was operated at 35 psig. One leak occurred where the backhoe bucket had contacted and pulled the natural gas service line. The other was a physical separation of the gas service line at an underground joint near the meter, which was close to the building. Gas migrated into a building nearby, where it ignited. An explosion followed, destroying three buildings. Other buildings within a two-block area of the explosion sustained significant damage. Three fatalities, five serious injuries, and one minor injury resulted from this accident. * 1999 On January 23, a construction crew ruptured a 10-inch diameter petroleum products pipe near Germantown, Wisconsin, spilling about 41,000 gallons of gasoline. * 1999 A pipeline ruptured in Knoxville, Tennessee, and released over of diesel fuel into the Tennessee River on February 9. A brittle-like crack was found on the pipe in an area of coating failure. The NTSB expressed concern that the material's toughness had a role in this rupture. Two days before the rupture, an in-line inspection device was run through the pipe segment, with no anomalies in the rupture area reported. Contributing to the severity of the accident was Colonial Pipeline Company's failure to determine from the SCADA system that a leak had occurred, with the result that the pipeline controller started and restarted the pipeline, increasing the amount of diesel fuel that was released. * 1999 On May 1, excavation equipment damaged a Koch Industries pipeline in Pleasant Hill, Iowa, spilling 3,663 barrels of crude oil. * 1999 A pipeline in a Bellingham, Washington park ruptured and leaked gasoline, and later vapor from the leak exploded and burned, killing two 10-year-old boys and an 18-year-old man on June 10, 1999. Issues causing the rupture were found to be previous pipe damage by excavation, an incorrectly set up pressure relief valve, unexpected repeated remote valve closures, and new software tests on the live controlling computer. * 1999 On June 24, about 100 barrels of gasoline spilled in a Buckeye Partners Terminal in Breinigsville, Pennsylvania. * 1999 On August 10, an auger being used to install utility poles hit a 14-inch ethane-propane pipeline, causing an explosion & fire that killed the auger operator, and forcing evacuations near Liberty Hill, Texas. * 1999 On August 29, a pump on Olympic Pipeline failed, in Renton, Washington, spilling about 3,360 gallons of gasoline and aviation fuel. About 950 tons of soil were removed due to contamination. * 1999 A Lakehead Pipeline (now Enbridge) was damaged by outside force, on November 1, near Crystal Falls, Michigan. 400 people were evacuated from the area. Fire was used to burn some of the released substances, so, of about 223,000 gallons of NGL's and crude oil spilled, only about 115,000 gallons were recovered, with over 2,100 yards of contaminated soil removed in just the first 2 weeks of cleaning. The pipe broke where it was on a rock in the pipeline trench. * 1999 On November 12, a natural-gas pipeline ruptured, killing one man, and injuring another. A spokeswoman for Northern Natural Gas said the 10-inch-diameter pipe was punctured by a digging crew in a field near Oelwein, Iowa, about 125 miles northeast of Des Moines.

When the pipe was excavated, it was found to be buckled and cracked. The NTSB found that the pipeline ruptured because of settlement of soil and trash underneath the pipeline. * 1998 On April 4, a tow of the M/V Anne Holly, comprising 12 loaded and 2 empty barges, which was traveling northbound on the Mississippi River through the St. Louis Harbor, struck the Missouri-side pier of the center span of the Eads Bridge. Three of these barges drifted toward the President Casino on the Admiral, a permanently moored vessel below the bridge on the Missouri side of the river. A natural gas leak resulted when the natural gas supply line to the Admiral was severed in the course of the accident. When the line broke, natural gas began escaping. Although the escaping gas did not ignite, the gas leak had continued for about 3 hours before being stopped. * 1998 In South Riding, Virginia, on July 7, a natural gas explosion and fire destroyed a newly constructed residence in the South Riding community in Loudoun County, Virginia.

As a result of the accident, the wife was killed, the husband was seriously injured, and the two children received minor injuries. Five other homes and two vehicles were damaged. The cause of the gas leak was inadequate separation between the electrical service line and the gas service line which was damaged during installation of the electrical line, allowing release of natural gas into the basement.Natural Gas Explosion and Fire in South Riding, Virginia, July 7, 1998, NTSB/PAR-01/01 (Washington, D.C.: adopted June 12, 2001), NTSB Pipeline Accident Report PB2001-916501. * 1998 On July 14, an earth mover hit an 8-inch LPG pipeline, near Placedo, Texas.

European Westerns had become popular when Germany's Rialto Film bought the rights to Karl May's Western novels, and made several films with director Harald Reinl with his Winetou series. Some of the films in that series were international co-productions involving Italian funding. As they became more successful in Italy, Italian investors began producing their own Westerns with four produced in 1964: Mario Costa's Buffalo Bill, Hero of the Far West, Sergio Corbucci's Minnesota Clay, Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars and The Road to Fort Alamo. Mario Bava biographer Tim Lucas described The Road to Fort Alamo as resembling the Winnetou films, as opposed to the style Leone developed with A Fistful of Dollars. The Road to Fort Alamo was filmed at Elios Film Studios in Rome and on location between February and March 1964. Michel Lemoine, who had a supporting role in the film, spoke about his work on it with Bava, stating that Bava \\"was an extraordinary director and he needed all of his talent to get through [The Road to Fort Alamo], because it was really difficult. The producers had money problems with that picture, and Bava had to fight constantly\\". Franco Prosperi, who served as one of the film's script writers and Bava's assistant director, expressed distaste towards it, stating that \\"Mario was useless at making Westerns; he had no talent for it. I disown [The Road to Fort Alamo] completely; it was kind of a disaster.\\" Release The Road to Fort Alamo was distributed by Comptoir Fran√ßais du Film in France on March 24, 1965. In that country, it was retitled Arizona Bill in the tradition of the twenty Arizona Bill films made in France between 1907 and 1913, starring Joe Hamman. In the United States, it was released by World Entertainment Corporation on July 10, 1966.

It was written by showrunner and executive producer Chris Chibnall, directed by Jennifer Perrott, and first broadcast on BBC One on 4 November 2018. In the episode, alien time traveller the Doctor (Jodie Whittaker) and her companions ‚Äì Graham O'Brien (Bradley Walsh), Ryan Sinclair (Tosin Cole), and Yasmin Khan (Mandip Gill) ‚Äì are brought aboard a medical ship to recover from injuries they recently endured, only to find themselves dealing with a dangerous alien creature that threatens the ship and those being transported by it. The episode guest stars Brett Goldstein, Lois Chimimba, Suzanne Packer, Ben Bailey-Smith, David Shields, and Jack Shalloo. The episode was watched by 7.76 million viewers, and was met with mixed reviews from critics.  Plot  While scavenging on an alien junkyard planet, the Thirteenth Doctor, and her companions, Graham, Yasmin, and Ryan are caught in a sonic mine's detonation. They wake aboard the Tsuranga, an automated ship travelling to a medical space-station. Exploring the ship, the Doctor meets some of the patients being transported ‚Äì Eve Cicero, a renowned general; her brother Durkas; Eve's synth robot partner Ronan; and Yoss, a pregnant man. After gaining access to the ship's systems, the Doctor, alongside head nurse Astos, notice something heading for the ship. They realise it is an alien entity, which gains access to the ship and starts damaging its escape pods. Astos becomes trapped in one that he is inspecting, and dies when the pod is jettisoned into space and explodes. Helped by Mabli, Astos' colleague, the Doctor learns that the entity is a Pting, a creature that eats non-organic material and is classed as highly dangerous. Learning that the ship will be remotely detonated if the space- station detects the creature aboard, the Doctor works to prevent this happening. While Yasmin and Ronan defend the ship's power source from the Pting, Ryan and Graham offer to help Mabli with Yoss as he enters labour. Meanwhile, the Doctor, Eve, and Durkas focus on gaining manual control of the ship. During this time, the Doctor learns that Eve has a critical heart condition that could kill her if she interfaces with the ship. Despite this, Eve sacrifices herself to protect everyone aboard the ship by keeping it safe, before Durkas assumes control in her place. The Doctor suddenly deduces that the Pting was attracted to the ship looking for energy sources, its true food source. With this knowledge, she returns to the ship's power source where she rationalises it has a built-in failsafe bomb. Removing it, she primes the device and feeds it to the Pting, giving it ample energy before she jettisons it into space. Durkas safely brings the Tsuranga to the space-station, while Ryan and Graham help Yoss give birth successfully. Before leaving to recover her TARDIS with the others, the Doctor joins Mabli and the patients in honouring the death of Eve for her courage in protecting them.  Production   Development  The Pting creature was created and named by writer Tim Price, who worked in the story room early in the series' development.

It was written by Vinay Patel, directed by Jamie Childs, and first broadcast on BBC One on 11 November 2018. In the episode, Yasmin Khan (Mandip Gill) asks the Doctor (Jodie Whittaker) to take her to see her grandmother (Leena Dhingra) during her youth (Amita Suman), only to cause both them and her friends Graham O'Brien (Bradley Walsh) and Ryan Sinclair (Tosin Cole) to become caught up in the events preceding the partition of India. During this time, the Doctor questions if aliens are involved in the death of a man killed during their visit. The episode was watched by 7.48 million viewers, and was met with positive reviews from critics.  Plot  While celebrating the birthday of her grandmother Umbreen, Yasmin receives a broken watch from her. Curious over its origins, Yasmin convinces a hesitant Thirteenth Doctor to take her, Graham and Ryan to the Punjab in August 1947 where the watch was broken. Upon arriving, Yasmin learns that the watch's previous owner was a Hindu man named Prem, whom a younger Umbreen intends to marry despite Yasmin's family being Muslim, and Prem definitely not being her grandfather. The Doctor notes that the group have arrived on 17 August, the day before the partition of India. She advises her friends to rush to the wedding ceremony to ensure that they and the family are not caught in the partitioning. But matters become complicated when the group see two aliens, that the Doctor had visions of during brief head pains, over the body of the wedding's overseer sadhu Bhakti. The group are joined by Prem, who saw the aliens around the time of his older brother's death during his military service in World War II, as the Doctor assumed the aliens killed Bhakti and eventually recognises them as members of the Thijarian, a race of assassins, while finding their ship and stealing a capsule from them. But the Doctor learns that the Thijarians are actually the last of their kind, the capsule holding what remained of their destroyed planet, and have dedicated themselves to commemorate those who die alone. After revealing that Prem will become a casualty of the partition they intend to witness, the Thijarians agree to show the Doctor a recording of Bhakti's death. The footage reveals Bhakti was murdered by Prem's younger brother Manish, who opposes the wedding. Returning to the others and convinced by Yasmin to see the event through, the Doctor oversees the marriage ceremony with the group witnessing the watch being accidentally broken as Umbreen cherishes its significance. When the Doctor later accosts Manish for Bhakti's murder, he reveals to have contacted a small group of armed Hindu nationalists to attack the wedding reception. As Umbreen and her mother escape with the Doctor's group, Prem remains behind to reason with Manish and dies when the nationalists shoot him while the Thijarians observe. Back in the present, Yasmin's grandmother comments on her granddaughter's new henna.  Production   Casting  After the premiere episode, \\"The Woman Who Fell to Earth\\" was broadcast, it was announced that Shane Zaza, Shobna Gulati, Hamza Jeetooa, and Amita Suman would be among a number of guest actors that would appear in the series. They play Prem, Nadja, Manish and the younger Umbreen respectively.

David Allen Kirby (born 30 November 1968) is an American professor of science communication studies within University of Manchester‚Äôs Centre for the History of Science, Technology and Medicine. He researches, writes about, and teaches science communication and the history of science. He is best known for his work showing how fictional narratives can be used in the process of design and for his studies on the use of scientists as consultants for Hollywood film productions.  Academic history  Kirby received his PhD in Zoology from the University of Maryland-College Park in 1996. He was an Assistant Professor in the Biology Department of American University until 2001 where he taught molecular biology and evolution. He then received a National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellowship that allowed him to re- train in the fields of science communication and science & technology studies (STS) in Cornell University‚Äôs Department of Science and Technology Studies. In 2004 he took up his current position at the University of Manchester where he is now Professor of Science Communication Studies in the Centre for the History of Science, Technology and Medicine.  Academic work  Kirby's scientific research was in the field of population genetics where he used techniques from molecular biology to explore the evolution of genetic diversity in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. His work contributed to our understanding of the role that genetic interactions play in evolution, a phenomenon known as epistasis. Kirby's concept of the diegetic prototype refers to the ways that fictional depictions can stimulate public discussions about social, cultural, and ethical implications of emerging technologies. The concept of the diegetic prototype provided one of the foundations for the creative approach to technological development known as design fiction. According to Julian Bleecker, the creator of the term design fiction, the \\"diegetic prototype provides a principle for understanding the ways in which science fact and science fiction always need each other to survive. In many ways, they are mutually dependent, the one using the other to define its own contours.\\" SF writer Bruce Sterling has also promoted the concept of the diegetic prototype. Kirby's primary impact on the field of science communication has been to bring the study of science in entertainment media into the mainstream of science communication studies. His work showed the importance of movies, television and other entertainment media for communicating science and it moved the field beyond its narrow focus on news media. He is director of the Science and Entertainment Lab. His 2011 book Lab Coats in Hollywood: Science, Scientists and Cinema was the first academic study of the interactions between the scientific community and the entertainment industry. The work focused on the contributions made by scientists who serve as consultants for Hollywood film productions and the subsequent impact these movies had on real world science and technology. The book transcended traditional academic boundaries with reviews not only in key journals for the history of science, science & technology studies, and science communication but also reviews in the prominent scientific journals Science and Nature as well as journals in the fields of physics, chemistry, psychiatry, literary studies, film studies, and science education. The book was also named one of Physics World magazine's top 10 best popular-physics books of 2011. Kirby's work also provided an academic foundation for the development of initiatives to enhance the use of science in entertainment products including the National Academy of Sciences‚Äô Science and Entertainment Exchange and the German program MINTEEE. In 2013 Kirby received an Investigator Award in the Medical Humanities from the Wellcome Trust for a project entitled \\"Playing God: Exploring the interactions among the biosciences, religion and entertainment media.\\" The goal of the project is to investigate the ways that entertainment professionals use science in entertainment medi, such as TV episodes, movies and computer games, and how religious communities respond to these entertainment texts. He is examining the period from 1930‚Äì1968 when religiously based movie censorship groups like the Hays Office and the Legion of Decency modified movie narratives in order to tell what they considered to be more appropriate stories about science in movies. Kirby's early work after his transition into science communication and STS primarily addressed the relationship between cinema, genetics and biotechnology. He was the first scholar to analyse the 1997 film GATTACA. He shows the ways in which the film serves as a bioethics text that warns society about embracing the notion that an individual's personality and capabilities are defined entirely by their genes, an ideology known as genetic determinism. His other work on the topic of cinema, genetics and biotechnology shows how most movies simultaneously embrace genetic determinism while also strongly opposing any scientific attempts to change our genes.  Science popularization  Kirby has given numerous public lectures on his research including co-headliner for the 2017 Geek Picnic in St. Petersburg, Russia, and co-headliner for the 2014 Imagine Film Festival.

It is one of the many key performance indicators (KPIs) used in the field. A WAULT is simply the product of currently contracted rental income between now and the time the leases expire for any given tenant, summed across tenants, and then divided by the total annual income of the property or portfolio being studied. The result is expressed in years. A closely related measure is the WAULT to break, which sums the individual rents to their first break, the point where the tenants can legally leave their lease. The basic definition is also known as WAULT to expiry to make the distinction clear. Depending on the market conditions, one might desire a high or low WAULT. For instance, if the rental market is strong and rents are rising, a low WAULT is desirable as that indicates that the current leases are going to expire or renegotiate in the short term and rental incomes are likely to rise. Conversely, in soft markets a long WAULT indicates steady income through lean periods. A WAULT-like value can also be expressed using leased areas instead of rents. Depending on the property type this may be a better indication of the market, as some leases like anchor tenants and kiosks might skew the results on a purely rent basis. This measure is sometimes known as a WALE, for weighted average lease expiry, although this terminology is not as common as WAULT.

Background Traditionally, most meat was shipped as primal cuts from the slaughterhouse to the butcher. Meat was then cut to commonly used cuts and packaged at the store or was custom cut for consumers. Case-ready meat is cut and packaged at central regional facilities and sent to retail stores ready for placement in refrigerated display cases. Local butchering, cutting, trimming, and overwrapping the meat at retail stores is greatly reduced. Advantages of the centralized master-packager preparation include: efficiency of centralized operations, tight quality control, close control of sanitization, specialized packaging, etc. Packaging Centralized cutting and processing of meats has the potential of reducing the shelf life of the cuts. Specialized packaging is needed to regain and even extend that shelf life. Packaging includes tray, absorbent pad, specialty plastic films, etc. Oxygen scavengers and Modified atmosphere packaging are used to keep the products visually appealing and consumer safe. Distribution Control of temperature during the distribution cold chain is critical to meat quality and safety. An effective Quality Management System needs to be in place and validated.

Early life Austin was born in Nixa, Missouri in February 1942. His father, J. E. ‚ÄúDutch‚Äù Austin, worked as a lumber trader for Georgia-Pacific, while his mother, Zola, worked in a factory. To supplement the family's income, Austin and his mother would take walks and collect bottles for recycling. During the summer, they picked blackberries and harvested foxgloves and cascara chittem bark for medicinal purposes. As he grew older, he took on a paper route and a host of other part-time jobs. In 1961, at age 19, following an offer from an uncle to work part-time at his hearing aid shop and inspired by medical breakthroughs, Austin attended the University of Minnesota with the intent to become a doctor and one day serve the needs of the poor in the developing world. His college career was cut short, however, after one particular customer changed his life. As Austin tells it, a kind elderly gentleman bemoaned that the feedback from his hearing aid was so loud that it actually worsened his hearing, and that no one had been able to repair it. Austin was able to fashion a new earpiece and helped the man to hear again. The man was exceptionally grateful, and his face beamed with gratitude, an image that stuck with Austin. After only a few weeks in college, Austin quit school and poured his time and energy into hearing devices. ‚ÄúAs a doctor, I could help maybe 20, 25 people a day,‚Äù Austin said. ‚ÄúI felt that if I did the hearing-aid business that I would be able to impact more people.‚Äù Career In 1970, Austin paid $13,000 for Starkey Labs, which at the time was a hearing aid parts shop. He merged it with his business and under his leadership, the business thrived, owing to a dedicated commitment to innovate and provide high-quality service. Starkey offered the market's first custom, in-the-ear hearing aid, which is the product for which the company is still best known. Later, Starkey became the first hearing device manufacturer to utilize both nano and digital technology. Austin also instituted strong customer service policies, including a 90-day free-trial period. Then, in September 1983, the company's fortunes soared after one of the world's best known figures, U.S. President Ronald Reagan, was photographed wearing Starkey hearing aids. Reagan's acknowledgement that he used hearing devices led to much greater acceptance globally of hearing aid technology. That he was fitted with Starkey hearing aids caused sales to quadruple in just a few weeks.30 Years Later, Ronald Reagan's Hearing Aid Fitting Still Reverberates Around the World, Audiology Online, 27 September 2013, retrieved 4 December 2019 Over time, Austin's company began expanding, both in the United States and overseas. Even as his company grew, his determination to help the poor never abated, and he began traveling to developing nations on charitable trips. At times, his trips have been without fanfare; other times, to raise awareness of the imperative for hearing solutions needed in the developing world, he has teamed with notable figures from all walks of life and all political parties. For example, in 2013, he joined former President Bill Clinton on a mission to Africa to give customized hearing devices to nearly 400 people in Zambia and Rwanda; that same year, he traveled with former President George W. Bush to provide hearing devices to more than 200 people in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.30 Years Later, Ronald Reagan's Hearing Aid Fitting Still Reverberates Around the World, Audiology Online, 27 September 2013, retrieved 4 December 2019 During his career, Austin has served five U.S. presidents, two popes and numerous humanitarians and luminaries including Mother Teresa, Walter Cronkite, Arnold Palmer, Billy Graham and many others. As of November 2019, his company had more than 6,000 employees working in 25 facilities, doing business in more than 100 markets worldwide.The Korea Times, 7 November 2019, retrieved 7 November 2019 Personal life and philanthropic activities In addition to his roles within Starkey Hearing Technologies, Austin spends much of his time‚Äîas much as 25 days a month‚Äîworking on behalf of his nonprofit Starkey Hearing Foundation, founded in 1984 by Austin and his wife, Tani.

On June 19, 2020, Attorney General William Barr announced that Carpenito would serve as acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York starting July 3, to replace Geoffrey Berman. However, Berman, whose office had overseen investigations involving President Trump, refused to step down.

While serving as an Assistant United States Attorney, he successfully prosecuted the Chairman of Cendant Corporation Walter Forbes for his role in the largest case of accounting fraud in the country's history at the time. On January 17, 2007, Forbes was sentenced to over 12 years in prison, and ordered to make restitution amounting to $3.28 billion. Prior to the conviction of Bernard Madoff, the Forbes restitution order was the largest restitution order ever imposed. Prior to becoming the U.S. Attorney, he was a partner with the law firm Alston & Bird, where he was a co-chair of the firm‚Äôs Litigation and Trial Practice Group and its Government and Internal Investigations Team.

As a two-year-old in 2018 he was one of the best colts of his generation in Europe, winning three of his five races including the July Stakes and the Phoenix Stakes. In the following year he developed into a top-class sprinter, recording major victories in the Commonwealth Cup and the Prix Maurice de Gheest. Background Advertise is a bay horse with a narrow white blaze bred by the Newmarket-based Cheveley Park Stud. In August 2017 the yearling was put up for auction at Goffs and was bought for ¬£60,000 by the bloodstock dealer Dermot Farrington. The colt's ownership was held by Manton Estate Racing before passing to Phoenix Thoroughbreds. He was sent into training with Martyn Meade at the Manton Estate near Manton, Wiltshire. He was from the fifth crop of foals sired by Showcasing, a stallion who won two of his seven races including the 2009 edition of the Gimcrack Stakes. His other foals have included Quiet Reflection, Toocoolforschool (Mill Reef Stakes), Prize Exhibit (San Clemente Handicap), Tasleet (Greenham Stakes) and Cappella Sansevero (Round Tower Stakes). Advertise's dam Furbelow showed modest racing ability, winning one minor race as a three-year-old in 2012. She was a granddaughter of Heart of Joy, who won the Nell Gwyn Stakes in England and the Palomar Handicap in the United States and was a distant relative of St Paddy and Flying Water. Racing career 2018: two-year-old season Advertise made his racecourse debut in a maiden race over six furlongs at Newbury Racecourse on 18 May in which he was ridden by Richard Kingscote and started the 4/1 joint- favourite in a twelve-runner field. After being restrained in the early stages he finished strongly, took the lead inside the last 100 yards and won by three quarters of a length from Pogo. In June the colt was moved up sharply in class for the Group 2 Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot. Ridden by Oisin Murphy he started at 10/1 and finished strongly to finish second of the 23 runners behind the John Gosden-trained Calyx who raced up the opposite side of the straight. Frankie Dettori took the ride when Advertise started the 11/10 favourite for the July Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 12 July. The best- fancied of his seven opponents were Legends of War (from the Gosden stable), Van Beethoven (Railway Stakes) and Konchek. He was settled towards the rear of the field before making good progress in the last quarter mile, taking the lead inside the final furlong and winning \\"comfortably\\" by a length from Konchek. Martyn Meade commented \\"Wow, that's all I can say. I'm so thrilled. He's done everything right, but of course you never know until you get on to the racetrack. I think he could prove to be a really good horse. He's got a bright future. I'm very much thinking 2000 Guineas next year ‚Äì over an extra distance I think he'll be a better horse\\". Dettori was again in the saddle when Advertise was sent to Ireland to contest the Group 1 Phoenix Stakes over six furlongs at the Curragh on 12 August. Before the race Meade had been very confident about the colt's future objectives, saying \\"It's just a case of which race we want to go and win\\", leading to accusations of \\"arrogance\\" on Twitter. His opponents included three from Aidan O'Brien's Ballydoyle stable, namely Sergei Prokofiev (Rochestown Stakes), The Irish Rover and the filly So Perfect (Grangecon Stud Stakes), while the five runner field was completed by the Jessica Harrington-trained Indigo Balance. In a change of tactics, Advertise disputed the lead from the start, established an advantage in the last quarter mile and won by half a length from So Perfect. Dettori said \\"he's got a great temperament and he really wants to do it for you\\". After becoming the first British trainer to win the race for over 20 years Meade commented \\"I've been quite bullish about this horse and luckily it's paid off, otherwise I might have had to eat my words. We'll give him a bit of a break and then go for the Dewhurst or something like that I suppose. The big question is if he'll get a mile, but he'll definitely get seven. It was a great ride by Frankie and it's great to have him on board. As he said to me after he won the July Stakes, \\"send him anywhere you like\\" and that proved to be right\\". After an absence of two months, Advertise returned in the Group 1 Dewhurst Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket on 12 October and started at odds of 7/1 in a seven-runner field. Ridden by Murphy he took the lead inside the final furlong but was overtaken and beaten into second place by Too Darn Hot. In the official ratings of European juveniles for 2018 Advertise was given a mark of 119, making him the fourth best two-year-old of the year behind Too Darn Hot, Quorto and Ten Sovereigns. 2019: three-year-old season On his three- year-old debut Advertise was one of seventeen colts to contest the 211th running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket on 4 May. He started at odds of 11/1 but was never in contention and came home fifteenth, more than nineteen lengths by the winner Magna Grecia. At Royal Ascot on 21 June the colt was dropped back in distance for the Commonwealth Cup over six furlongs and started the 8/1 fifth choice in a nine-runner field. Ten Sovereigns started favourite while the best fancied of the other runners were Jash (King Charles II Stakes), Hello Youmzain and Khadeem (Carnarvon Stakes). Ridden by Dettori, Advertise was in contention from the start, took the lead jut inside the final furlong and kept on well to win by a length and a half from Forever In Dreams (also owned by Phoenix Thoroughbreds) with Hello Youmzain and Ten Sovereigns close behind in third and fourth. Martyn Meade, whose trainees had been running inexplicably poorly in the spring said \\"There's obviously huge elation but certainly relief as well, as the horses have been well under par. He's only had one bad run in the and I've always believed in him. He was not right at Newmarket; we wanted to see if he got the mile but never found out that day, and we decided to go back to what we know over six, where we knew he was so good last year.\\" Three weeks after his win at Ascot, Advertise started 3/1 favourite when he was matched against older horses for the first time in the July Cup over six furlongs at Newmarket. He was in contention throughout the race and stayed on well but proved no match for Ten Sovereigns who beat him into second place by two and three quarter lengths. The colt was then sent to France for the Prix Maurice de Gheest over 1300 metres at Deauville Racecourse in which he was partnered by Dettori and went off the 2.2/1 favourite. His fourteen opponents included Space Blues (Surrey Stakes), Polydream (winner of the race in 2018), One Master (Prix de la For√™t), Pretty Pollyanna, King Malpic (Prix de Ris-Orangis), Le Brivido (Jersey Stakes) and Brando (winner in 2017). After tracking the leaders Advertise took the lead 300 metres from the finish and held off a late challenge from Brando to win by a neck. Dettori commented \\"he showed a good turn of foot... He was just idling a bit, but when he felt Brando coming, he took off again... he's a tough horse. He doesn't know how to run a bad race.\\" On 19 October Advertise was made 4/1 joint favourite (alongside One Master) for the British Champions Sprint Stakes over six furlongs at Ascot. Racing on heavy ground he was in contention for most of the way but was unable to quicken in the closing stages and came home seventh behind the 33/1 upset winner Donjuan Triumphant. On 1 November it was announced that Advertise had been retired from racing and that he would begin his stud career at the National Stud in 2020.

They are best known for their musical comedy on their YouTube channel, which has reached over 2.75 million subscribers and 646 million views as of 14 September 2020. History Brett Yang and Eddy Chen first met each other in mathematics tutoring, when Yang was 14 and Chen 13. They became acquainted as the youngest members of a youth orchestra and later as students at Queensland Conservatorium Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia. Yang's debut at Queensland Conservatorium was performing the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto in 2012. He has worked with various other Australian orchestras, including a performance at the 2014 G20 Brisbane summit. Chen was a finalist for the National Young Virtuoso Award in Queensland in 2014 and had played with the Queensland and Melbourne symphonies. In 2013, they started posting covers of pop music played on the violin on their YouTube channel. In an interview with CutCommon, Yang said they saw violin virtuosos who had millions of views on YouTube playing covers and attempted to do the same to minimal reaction. They then discovered violinist Ray Chen made comedic videos and shifted their content in a similar direction. They focused their videos on their lives in the conservatory culture, as classical musicians and as students, which led to a dramatic increase in viewership. At the end of 2016, Yang and Chen renounced their places in the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and Queensland Symphony Orchestra respectively to begin performing live concerts of their own. In 2018, their YouTube channel received the Silver Play Button, and in 2019, they received the Gold Play Button.References announcing their play buttons from YouTube:  * Kyle Macdonald of Classic FM listed TwoSet Violin as one of the \\"10 ways the 2010s changed classical music forever\\". On 22 January 2020, it was announced that TwoSet Violin would be attending the Menuhin Competition held at Richmond, Virginia as roving reporters. However, it was postponed to May 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic. On 8 February 2020, TwoSet Violin live streamed their performance of the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto to celebrate achieving 2 million subscribers in which Yang played the solo part and Chen performed an original arrangement of the orchestral component for solo violin. Tours TwoSet announced their first live performance Brisbane, Australia on 8 September 2016 via YouTube. The act featured violin performance more in the format of a comedy act than a traditional concert. With KickStarter as their fundraising method along with street performance in Sydney, they raised enough money to go on a worldwide tour in 2017 to 11 cities in 10 countries, in Asia and Europe including Taipei, Helsinki, and Frankfurt. In 2018, they performed in several places in the United States including New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. In October 2019, TwoSet announced another world tour where they planned to visit multiple locations in Oceania, Europe, Asia and North America. However, the tour was postponed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and new dates have not been announced as of August 2020.  Videos, gimmicks and themes  In 2017, TwoSet Violin made a comedic reference to Ling Ling, a fictional violinist who \\"practices 40 hours a day\\". In an interview with Yle Uutiset, they described Ling Ling as the final boss of a video game: the Chuck Norris of violinists. Chen said they improvised the character from their comedy sketch video concerning a teenage violin student's tiger mom comparing the student to her friend's child. In 2018, they released a series of videos called the Ling Ling Workout. In these challenges, the duo draws a classical piece (or contemporary music) and a handicap such as playing with double speed, scordatura, playing while dancing or hula hooping, with hand positions reversed, or while upside down. Prominent violinists such as Ray Chen, Ziyu He, and Hilary Hahn have also attempted the challenge on their channel.Hilary Hahn Ling Ling Workouts:  In July 2018, they released a series of videos in which they performed classical music using rubber chickens. In August 2018, they released a video series called \\"1% Violin Skills, 99% Editing Skills\\" in which Yang attempts to play a difficult piece, and Chen asks him to play a chromatic scale. Chen then uses video editing to piece together the notes as originally composed. Other gimmicks include violin charades, playing other instruments,References to Twoset Violin's professional vs. beginner videos  and viola jokes.Viola- related videos:   Another popular video series consists of reviews of film and TV show scenes that feature violin playing, in which Yang and Chen critique egregiously fake performances. On 1 April, 2019, they claimed they discovered a new Double Violin Concerto by J.S. Bach. On 14 September 2018, TwoSet Violin uploaded a reaction video to a BBC News story titled \\"Fastest Violinist in the World\\", in which they challenged violinist Ben Lee's Guinness World Record claim of playing \\"Flight of the Bumblebee\\" for what they perceived to be significant inaccuracy. They satirically timed themselves purposefully playing random fast notes before declaring they had broken the world record. In April 2019, the duo similarly called out Vov Dylan, who was awarded the title of World's Fastest Violinist by the Australian Book Of Records, concluding that Dylan's performance of \\"Bumblebee\\" was worse than Lee's.

These mills chiefly ground wheat, often referred to as corn, for flour and oats for animal feed though many were used in the production of other goods such as paper, cloth, leather, wire and gunpowder. The river was home to more mills per mile than anywhere else in Great Britain. The mill situated at Coxes Lock near Addlestone, Surrey, is the largest. There are many mills on the river's principal tributaries, such as the Tillingbourne, the Ock and some mills on the Whitmore Vale stream, Cranleigh Waters and Hodge Brook. The last commercial mill on the Tillingbourne, Botting's Mill at Albury, closed in 1990. Headley Water Mill, on the Wey South branch is still in business.

The book examines some of the universe greatest mysteries, and promotes the view that science is very important in helping to solve problems on planet Earth. The publisher describes the book as \\"a selection of [Hawking's] most profound, accessible, and timely reflections from his personal archive\\", and included, according to a book reviewer, drawing upon \\"half a million or so words\\" from his essays, lectures and keynote speeches. The book was incomplete at the time of the author's passing in March 2018, but was completed with \\"his academic colleagues, his family and the Stephen Hawking Estate\\". A foreword to the book was written by Eddie Redmayne, Oscar-winning actor who portrayed Stephen Hawking in the 2014 film, The Theory of Everything; an introduction by Kip Thorne, Nobel-prize winning physicist; and an afterword by Lucy Hawking, the author's daughter. A portion of the royalties from the book are to go to the Motor Neurone Disease Association and the Stephen Hawking Foundation. Contents The book is divided into four sections: \\"Why Are We Here? Will We Survive? Will Technology Save Us or Destroy Us? How Can We Thrive?\\". Stephen Hawking at NASA's StarChild Learning Center, 1980s The ten big questions that are considered include: Is there a God? How did it all begin? What is inside a black hole? Can we predict the future? Is time travel possible? Will we survive on Earth? Is there other intelligent life in the universe? Should we colonise space? Will artificial intelligence outsmart us? How do we shape the future? The book discusses many of today's challenges, including the biggest threat to the planet (an \\"asteroid collision\\", like the one that wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago ... \\"we have no defense\\" against that), climate change (\\"a rise in ocean temperature would melt the ice caps and cause the release of large amounts of carbon dioxide ... [making] our climate like that of Venus with a temperature of \\"), the threat of nuclear war (\\"at some point in the next 1,000 years, nuclear war or environmental calamity will 'cripple Earth'\\"), nuclear power (\\"that would give us clean energy with no pollution or global warming\\"), the development of artificial intelligence (AI) (\\"in the future AI could develop a will of its own, a will that is in conflict with ours\\") and humans (\\"a genetically-modified race of superhumans, say with greater memory and disease resistance, would imperil the others\\"). The book also discusses the \\"big questions\\", including life (\\"in the next 50 years, we will come to understand how life began and possibly discover whether life exists elsewhere in the universe\\"), time (\\"You can't get to a time before the Big Bang [because] there was no time before the Big Bang ... If the concept of time only exists within our universe and the universe came to be spontaneously ... and with it, brought time into existence, there's simply no 'before' to consider.\\" Further, Hawking believed the universe could reach an end point, either through an eventual cosmic \\"crunch or an expansion\\" ... \\"In the interim ... We are all time travelers, journeying together into the future. But let us make that future a place we want to visit\\"), the possibility of time travel (\\"asking if time travel is possible is a 'very serious question' that our current understanding cannot rule out\\"), and God (\\"knowing the mind of God is knowing the laws of nature ... My prediction is that we will know the mind of God by the end of this century\\"; further, \\"if you like, you can call the laws of science ‚ÄòGod,‚Äô but it wouldn't be a personal God that you would meet and put questions to ... [nevertheless] the simplest explanation is that God does not exist and there is no reliable evidence for an afterlife, though people could live on through their influence and genes\\"). According to Hawking in the book, education and science are \\"in danger now more than ever before\\", and urged young people \\"to look up at the stars and not down at your feet ... Try to make sense of what you see, and wonder about what makes the universe exist ... It matters that you don't give up. Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.\\" Reviews First edition cover (Paperback) Physicist Marcelo Gleiser, reviewing the book for NPR, writes: \\"Stephen Hawking is one of those rare luminaries whose life symbolizes the best humanity has to offer ... [his book is one] every thinking person worried about humanity's future should read ... If there is a unifying theme across the book, it is Hawking's deep faith in science's ability to solve humanity's biggest problems ... His answers to the big questions illustrate his belief in the rationality of nature and on our ability to uncover all its secrets. His optimism permeates every page ... Although Hawking touches on the origin of the universe, the physics of black holes and some of his other favorite topics, his main concern in this book is not physics. It's humanity and its collective future ... Focusing his attention in the book on three related questions ‚Äì the future of our planet, colonization of other planets, and the rise of artificial intelligence ‚Äì he charts his strategy to save us from ourselves ... Only science, Hawking argues, can save us from our mistakes ... Hawking believes that humanity's evolutionary mission is to spread through the galaxy as a sort of cosmic gardener, sowing life along the way. He believes ... that we will develop a positive relation with intelligent machines and that, together, we will redesign the current fate of the world and of our species.\\" According to award-winning science editor Tim Radford, writing for The Guardian, Hawking's book is \\"effortlessly instructive, absorbing, up to the minute and ‚Äì where it matters ‚Äì witty.\\" Radford quotes Hawking, \\"If the universe adds up to nothing, then you don't need a God to create it. The universe is the ultimate free lunch\\"; \\"our worst mistake ever\\" [if we are dismissive about artificial intelligence]; \\"Our future is a race between the growing power of our technology and the wisdom with which we use it. Let's make sure that wisdom wins.\\" and \\"If humanity is to continue for another million years, our future lies in going boldly [with more manned space exploration] where no one else has gone before.\\" Radford writes, \\"People who argue for good education for all, a decently funded NHS (National Health Service) and serious investment in research will rediscover him as a friend.\\" Reviewer Abigail Higgins, writing for Vox, notes that author Hawking, in the book, is \\"funny and optimistic, even as he warns us that artificial intelligence is likely to outsmart us, that the wealthy are bound to develop into a superhuman species, and that the planet is hurtling toward total inhabitability ... [the] book is ultimately a verdict on humanity's future. At first blush, the verdict is that we‚Äôre doomed. But dig deeper and there's something else here too, a faith that human wisdom and innovation will thwart our own destruction, even when we seem hellbent on bringing it about.\\" According to a book review by science journalist Matin Durraniin, current editor of Physics World: \\"Hawking ticks off all the big ideas you‚Äôd expect from one of his books. General relativity. The Big Bang. Inflation. Galaxy formation. Gravitational waves ... This book will stand as Hawking's manifesto. Optimistic, upbeat and visionary, it sees science ‚Äì and scientific understanding ‚Äì as vital for the future of humanity.\\" Criticism According to John Horgan, science journalist writing for The Wall Street Journal, Hawking, in his book, prefers string theory as a way of explaining the \\"theory of everything\\" (which Hawking predicts to be solved by \\"the end of this century\\") and, based on quantum mechanics, considers empty space as filled with virtual particles, \\"popping into and out of existence\\", suggesting our entire universe began as one of those particles, and additionally, that our cosmos is \\"just a minuscule bubble in an infinite ocean, or 'multiverse'\\". In this regard, Horgan refers to the concern of German physicist Sabine Hossenfelder, in her 2018 book \\"Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray\\", that \\"physicists working on strings and multiverses are not really practising physics,\\" and quotes Hossenfelder, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure anymore that what we do here, in the foundations of physics, is science‚Äù. Nevertheless, according to Ephrat Livni writing for Quartz, Hawking believed \\"The laws of nature itself tell us that not only could the universe have popped into existence without any assistance, like a proton, and have required nothing in terms of energy, but also it is possible that nothing caused the Big Bang. Nothing.\\" Jon Christian, writing for Futurism and published in Science Alert, notes that Hawking, in his book, makes several predictions, including predictions about gene editing, artificial intelligence and religion, with which some experts may not fully agree. Reviewer Zayan Guedim, commenting on EdgyLabs, writes, \\"The book is not a culmination of all of the great scientist's works, and it doesn't provide any particularly new discoveries. However, it does show us the importance of our future, the 'Big Questions' and the growing necessity of looking after our planet.\\" See also      References External links    Brief Answers to the Big Questions ‚Äì Overview Description * Brief Answers to the Big Questions ‚Äì More News * Books by Stephen Hawking 2018 non-fiction books Books by Stephen Hawking Popular science books ","title":"Brief Answers to the Big Questions"},{"id":"58759982","text":"' (, ) is a type of naengmyeon (cold noodles) in Korean Chinese cuisine. The dish, consisting of icy cold broth with noodles, blanched seafood, fresh vegetables, and hard-boiled egg, is usually served with mustard and peanut sauce.  History  Despite the name, the dish originated in Korea. The flavour profile is influenced by chilled noodle dishes in Chinese cuisine, such as () and (), which are served cold but aren't noodle soups. The Korean Chinese dish incorporates the Korean tradition of serving noodles in icy cold broth (naengmyeon). Early records of the dish includes the mentioning of (, ) on 22 June 1947 in the newspaper The Jeju Sinbo, and mentioning of (, ) in The Dong-a Ilbo on 25 September 1962. It is assumed that the dish was popularized in South Korea during the 1960s, when Chinese-style peanut sauce was largely replaced by peanut butter from U.S. military bases. In 1980s, high-end Korean Chinese restaurants in major hotels began to serve this dish.  Preparation and serving  Chicken broth is usually used in jungguk-naengmyeon. The broth, seasoned with ginger, onion, and rice wine, is served chilled with Chinese- style wheat noodles and toppings. Mustard and peanut sauce is usually added to the dish.

Plot In Noida, Radha \\"Dolly\\" Yadav is part of a middle-class family with her husband Amit and two sons. While they are financially stable, they struggle to pay the installments for a new luxury apartment they are in the process of purchasing. Unbeknownst to Amit, Dolly manages the payments by selling her jewelry or by stealing money from her employers, a small accounting firm. Dolly's younger cousin Kajal has recently arrived from rural Bihar to chase her dreams and aspirations in the city. When Kajal tells Dolly that Amit makes unwanted advances towards her, Dolly puts it down to misunderstanding and laughs it off. Uncomfortable with her situation, Kajal looks to move out of Dolly's home but this is made difficult by her lack of qualifications. Eventually, Kajal takes up a job at a call center for Red Rose Romance, a paid dating app where men can call in and speak to the women of their fantasies. After working through the initial shock of realization that most men call the app demanding phone sex, she takes on the identity of \\"Kitty\\" and becomes an expert at navigating tricky calls. She moves into a hostel and experiences the freedom of big city life with her new friends Shazia and DJ Gurjar. She hides this information from Dolly, who finds Kajal's line of work indecent and unfit for women from good families. Meanwhile, Dolly struggles with hypoactive sexual desire disorder, leading to lack of intimacy with Amit and frustration. Dolly sets up a meeting with her estranged mother to understand whether her sexual difficulties are genetic, but her mother denies having any sexual problems and encourages Dolly to discover herself and find her own freedom. Dolly also has to reckon with the cross-dressing tendencies of her younger son Pappu, which nearly gets him expelled from school. When Kajal's call center becomes the center of media attention, Dolly confronts her, and the two have a verbal blow-up. Kajal develops a friendship with a man called Pradeep through the Red Rose Romance app. While on a trip to the Taj Mahal, she asks Pradeep to join him for a date, and they soon become intimate. Meanwhile Dolly strikes up a friendship with MBA student and delivery man Osmaan, over several meetings they become close. When local political goons organize a raid on a well-known lovers' lane, Kajal and Pradeep are arrested for public indecency and taken to jail. Pradeep bribes the policemen and arranges himself to be freed, then disappears without a second thought for Kajal. She calls Dolly, who comes and picks her up. The two open up to each other, with Dolly speculating that her disorder is a result of a hymen re-stitching operation that she got to make it seem like she was still a virgin when she married Amit, and Kajal recounting her disappointment at her first sexual experience. Dolly expresses that it would be a great idea if an equivalent for Red Rose Romance existed for women. Later, Kajal tracks down Pradeep, only to find out that he's actually a married man called Chhatrasar Singh. When Shazia breaks up with Gurjar, Kajal becomes intimate with him and is able to achieve orgasm through oral sex. Dolly becomes intimate with Osmaan. When they have sex, she enjoys it, realizing that her lack of sexual satisfaction with Amit is not a result of a clinical disorder, but stems from a lack of desire. Kajal's office is vandalized by the political goons, and several of the women working at the call center quit their jobs, fearing for their safety. Kajal, Dolly, and her family visit a local fair for the unveiling of a new structure by a feminist artist. Kajal comes across Pradeep, who promises to leave his family for her, but she rejects him. The new structure is the shape of a vagina, and the gathering is soon attacked by goons who deem it to be against Indian culture. In the resulting commotion, Shazia and Osmaan are shot dead. Kajal and Dolly grieve for them, and reconcile due to their shared grief. Amit finds out about Dolly's affair, but wants to move on from it and resume the appearance of being in a normal family. However, Dolly explains that she is not attracted to him, and decides that she wants to separate. Her older son chooses to stay with Amit, but Pappu comes with her. Kajal goes back to her bosses, and they re-open the office and launch a new Red Rose app for women. The last shot of the film is Dolly and Pappu taking a bus ride out of town, recalling Dolly's own experience with her mother.

Since 2011, Saleh has participated in several activities in defense of human rights and has been repeatedly detained by the Venezuelan authorities on terrorism charges. The Venezuelan government has accused Saleh of carrying out paramilitary training and planning attacks against Venezuela. In 2014, he was deported from Colombia and handed over to officials of the Bolivarian Intelligence Service (SEBIN). Until 2018, he was being held in La Tumba, in Plaza Venezuela, Caracas during which time his audience had been postponed 52 times. On 12 October 2018, he was released by the Venezuelan authorities and exiled to Spain, where he arrived the next day after landing at the Madrid‚ÄìBarajas Airport. Activism In 2009, Saleh, together with other young people, formed a platform to make national tours of opposition to the government of Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez. In February 2011, he began a hunger strike in front of the headquarters of the Organization of American States (OAS) in Caracas with 13 other young people as the national coordinator of the Active Youth Organization Venezuela Unida (JAVU). demanding the release of , Jos√© S√°nchez Mazuco and Judge Mar√≠a Lourdes Afiuni, among other people considered as political prisoners, and asking Secretary General Jos√© Miguel Insulza to be \\"more forceful in the face of the government's crimes.\\" Saleh was accused the same year of the crime of \\"disseminating false information that causes distress\\" along with Gabriel Vall√©s, another student activist, when they were arrested with slingshots and other materials to use during the protests and with posters pointing at then-President Ch√°vez to lying about his electoral promises. On 2 May 2011, members of the Bolivarian National Guard fired shots at some demonstrators and evicted several youths, including Saleh, who had chained themselves to the gates of the Judicial Circuit of Barinas to demand the release of Delf√≠n Parra G√≥mez, a military man who was processed. for alleged corruption in the Central Agroindustrial Azucarero Ezequiel Zamora (Caeez) and whom the youth considered a political prisoner. Saleh was severely beaten and detained, and as a result of the event, judicial proceedings were opened for the alleged crimes of resistance to authority, basic type injuries and violent outrage against a public official. His mother, Yamileth Saleh, was also imputed during the presentation hearing. At the beginning of July, Saleh was arrested by the Bolivarian Intelligence Service (SEBIN) while he was arriving at a peaceful protest on Urdaneta Avenue, in Caracas. He was released hours later. In December he is arrested again by unidentified individuals after landing at the Santo Domingo airport in T√°chira. In 2012, Saleh's NGO Operaci√≥n Libertad launched an international campaign in rejection of the departure of Venezuela from the Inter-American Human Rights System. Saleh was beaten by military personnel while participating in a protest at the University of the Andes. Days later, in January 2013, when trying to travel to Costa Rica, airport authorities of Valencia, Carabobo prevented him from boarding the plane and canceled his passport. After accusations that at the end of July 2013 Saleh participated in Colombia in the launching of the Nationalist Alliance for Freedom, a political movement that defines itself as \\"Identitarian nationalist\\" in addition to \\"anti-Zionist\\", Saleh said months later in an interview with El Espectador: \\"I am Latin American, of Palestinian family, I can not believe in Nazi, neo-Nazi or radical positions of any kind, I am not Neo-Nazi nor do I believe in militarist governments.\\" In February 2014, Saleh began an international campaign to denounce human rights violations during the 2014 Venezuelan protests. In Costa Rica he got the attention of the Congress, members of the Church and important figures of the country. On February 19, seven days after the start of the protests, the death of three people in Caracas and the handing over of Leopoldo L√≥pez to the Venezuelan authorities, Saleh traveled again to Colombia. On 2 May, Venezuelan Interior Minister Miguel Rodr√≠guez Torres claimed that Henrique Salas R√∂mer financed the JAVU group and read a supposed document with confidential information dated 2011, about supposed \\"training camps\\" held in Carabobo by the group on a farm property of Venezuelan opposition deputy Freddy Curupe, in which Saleh is mentioned. Deportation and detention at La Tumba On 4 September, Saleh notified several friends that there was a suspicious car circulating around his residence in Bogot√°. Hours later he was arrested in an operation that the Migration Office of Colombia justified in a decree that signals the deportation of foreigners when they represent a threat to national security or if they are requested by the authorities of other countries. The same day was handed over to SEBIN officials in San Crist√≥bal and the Migration Office of San Antonio del T√°chira. Upon arriving in Venezuela, Saleh was accused of three other crimes for having falsified, while working for the Venezuelan immigration service, identity documents for Colombian citizens to participate in violent demonstrations in Venezuela. His family and his lawyer stated that Saleh has never worked for the immigration service or for any other Venezuelan government office. In several television interventions, pro- government leaders accused Saleh of having links with Colombian paramilitaries and former Colombian President √Ålvaro Uribe, and of planning coup and terrorist activities in Venezuela, but these accusations are not included in his court file. On 2 March 2015, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) issued precautionary measures of protection in resolution 6/2015 in favor of Lorent Saleh and Gerardo Carrero in response to the request made on 8 July 2013 by Tamara Suj√∫ on behalf of the Foro Penal (Criminal Forum), in which he asked the agency to require the Venezuelan government to protect the life and personal integrity of Saleh and, later in the proceedings, also the protection of Carrero for the alleged violation of his human rights. The IACHR document notes that Saleh and Guerrero \\"would be located in a basement (five floors below ground), known as La Tumba (\\"The Tomb\\"), of the building that serves as the main headquarters of the SEBIN, where they are subjected to \\"prolonged isolation without contact with other people, in a confined space of 2 √ó 3 meters, with video cameras and microphones in each of their cells, without access to sunlight or outdoors,\\" and the two prisoners have reported suffering from \\"nervous breakdowns, stomach problems, diarrhea, vomiting, spasms, joint pains, headaches, dermatitis, panic attacks, muscle disorders and temporary disorientation\\" without \\"presumably receiving adequate medical attention.\\" The Commission considered that the students \\"are in a situation of seriousness and urgency, since their lives and personal integrity would be at risk\\", and in accordance with Article 25 of the IACHR's Rules of Procedure, the agency asked the Venezuelan government to adopt the measures necessary to preserve the life and personal integrity of detainees, in particular to provide adequate medical care in accordance with the conditions of their pathologies, and to ensure that their detention conditions are in accordance with international standards, taking into consideration their current health status. On 20 April 2015, Lorent tried to commit suicide in his cell, which was stopped by SEBIN officials. His lawyer denounced that by then he had not received a response from the Public Ministry about the request for psychiatric evaluations of Saleh and Gabriel Valles. Saleh at his arrival at the Madrid‚ÄìBarajas Airport in October 2018 In 2017, Saleh was one of eight Venezuelans awarded with the Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament, one of the representatives being all political prisoners enumerated by the Foro Penal. In November, after the deferment of the preliminary hearing of Lorent 42 times, his relatives requested his immediate release to the Attorney General appointed by the Constituent National Assembly, Tarek William Saab, explaining that if a trial is not initiated two years after the arrest, the accused must be released immediately.9 On 4 September 2018, his hearing had been deferred 52 times. By 4 September 2018, his hearing had been deferred 52 times. On 12 October 2018, Saleh was released, under the figure of exile (despite being a figure that does not exist in the laws of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela), supposedly to prevent him from committing suicide. He arrived at the Madrid‚ÄìBarajas Airport on 13 October at 10:15 in the morning.

They are a branch of the larger identitarian movement within Europe. The group campaign against immigration and Islamisation as part of what Identitarians call 'the Great Replacement', a white nationalist conspiracy theory comprised by political philosopher Renaud Camus. Identitarian activists participate in a series of actions and stunts of which they use to aim to change the political climate. History In October 2017, key figures of the Identitarian movement met in London in efforts to target the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom and Ireland branch was launched in late October 2017 after a banner was unfurled on Westminster Bridge reading \\"Defend London, Stop Islamisation\\". On 9 March 2018, Martin Sellner and his fianc√©e Brittany Pettibone were barred from entering the UK. The reason stated was that their presence was \\"not conducive to the public good.\\" Prior to the ban, Martin Sellner intended to deliver a speech to the Young Independence party, though they cancelled the event citing alleged threats of violence from the far-left. He intended to deliver his speech at Speakers' Corner in Hyde park prior to being detained and deported. In June 2018, Tore Rasmussen, a Norwegian activist who had previously been denied entry to the United Kingdom, was working in the Republic of Ireland to establish a local branch of Generation Identity. Generation Identity pages on Facebook were removed from the platform in June 2018, however they still remain on Twitter. In June 2018 Martin Sellner was stopped at customs from entering the United Kingdom again to attend the Generation Identity European Conference in London. This then led to well-known far-right activist Tommy Robinson reading out his speech at Speakers Corner. Ideology The Identitarian Movement bases itself on a form of the Nouvelle Droite known as Identitarianism. Generation Identity focuses on its opposition to Islamisation, The Great Replacement and Globalisation as its 'Three Key Points'. Works from Nouvelle Droite authors such as Guillaume Faye and Alain De Benoist are used by Generation Identity. The Identitarian Movement can find its ideological origins in the New Right Groupement de recherche et d'√©tudes pour la civilisation europ√©enne. Identitarianism proposes Ethnopluralism, the belief that individual ethnocultural groups should remain in historical homelands. Guillaume Faye is listed as ideological inspiration of the Identitarian Movement in the UK.

He was instrumental in the construction of Greenock Harbour, and took part in actions against the Jacobite risings. Shaw was the eldest son of Sir John Shaw, 2nd Baronet and his wife Eleanor Nicolson, daughter of Sir Thomas Nicolson, 2nd Baronet, of Carnock. The Shaw (or Schaw) family owned estates in Clackmannan, and his father became instrumental in developing the growth of Greenock to rival Glasgow on the River Clyde, and in particular seeking funds to build a harbour at Greenock. Shaw was educated at Glasgow in 1694. He married Margaret Dalrymple, eldest daughter of Hon. Sir Hew Dalrymple, 1st Baronet of North Berwick, Haddington on 15 March 1700. Also in 1700 he became a Burgess of Glasgow. He succeeded his father to the baronetcy on 16 April 1702 and set out to achieve his father's aim of creating a harbour at Greenock. Shaw's various family properties at Greenock, Renfrewshire, Sauchie, Clackmannanshire; and Carnock Stirlingshire gave him several options for a parliamentary seat at the 1708 general election, and he chose to stand for Renfrewshire. He was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Renfrewshire. He and his fellow citizens raised their own funds to build Greenock Harbour, and the work was completed in 1710, with quays extended out into Sir John's Bay to enclose the harbour. Shaw did not stand at the 1710 and 1713 general elections, but he continued fight for better regulation of customs in western Scotland. Battle of Sheriffmuir, 1715 Shaw celebrated the safe arrival of King George I in October 1714 in an elaborate manner. He did not stand at the 1715 general election but was active during the year in suppressing the Jacobite rising. He fought at several battles, including the Battle of Sheriffmuir in November 1715, acting closely with the Duke of Argyll. He became a burgess of Inveraray, the Duke's home town, in 1720. With the support of the Duke of Argyll, Shaw revived his parliamentary career, and was returned as a Whig MP for Clackmannanshire in the 1722 general election. He supported the government and voted for the bills of pains and penalties against those involved in the Atterbury plot. He protested to Walpole against filling offices in Scotland with Englishmen. He was active on behalf of the Government. in the malt tax riots of 1725, when the Glasgow magistrates would not take action against the mob. For several years he had been pressing for strong measures to prevent the running of Irish goods into Scotland, and in 1725 was granted a commission which permitted him ‚Äòto burn all boats that shall bring meal or grain from Ireland to Scotland‚Äô. Shaw was returned unopposed as MP for Renfrewshire at the 1727 general election. He continued to vote with the Administration. In 1734 he stood for parliament at Clackmannanshire but was unsuccessful. During the 1745 Jacobite rebellion, he and his wife mobilised support locally for General John Campbell's forces, and raised a militia in Greenock despite threats from the rebels. Shaw died at Sauchie on 5 April 1752, and the baronetcy became extinct on his death. His daughter Marion married Charles Cathcart, 8th Lord Cathcart in 1718 and commissioned a new building at Nether Greenock Castle in the 1730. However, on her death in 1733 the mansion reverted to her father. Stravaiging around Scotland - Greenock Castle On his death, his estates went to the family of his sister Margaret, who married Sir John Houston, 3rd Baronet and was grandmother of Sir John Stewart. Stewart adopted the additional surname Shaw, and his succession continued as the Shaw Stewart baronets of Greenock and Blackhall.

Schindler is an assistant professor at the University of Michigan, College of Literature, Science and Arts. Early life and education Schindler grew up in Germany, where she also did her undergraduate work. As an undergraduate, Schindler attended the Technical University of Munich (TUM). She completed her diploma thesis (equivalent of a master of science) under the direction of K. C. Nicolaou at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla. Schindler earned her doctorate degree at the ETH Zurich under the direction of Erick M. Carreira. Her Ph.D. thesis focused on the development of new synthetic strategies of natural products centered on the opening of oxabicyclic ring systems. After completing her doctorate degree, Dr. Schindler joined Eric N. Jacobsen‚Äôs research group at Harvard University as a Feodor Lynen Postdoctoral Fellow. Research interests Schindler‚Äôs research group includes an international team of researchers working in the area of organic chemistry with an emphasis on the synthesis of molecules of biological importance. Key areas of interest include the development of new synthetic routes for molecules that are potentially important in the areas of material science and medicine. Her laboratory recently has been successful in incorporating a ‚Äúgreen‚Äù iron catalyst in a carbonyl-olefin ring closure metathesis reaction that can replace the current precious metal reagents, which are expensive and can be harmful to the environment. The catalyst used is iron (III) chloride. A catalyst is a species that speeds up the kinetics of a reaction by lowering its activation energy and is recovered at the end of the reaction. Catalysts are used to improve reaction yields and decrease reaction times. Schindler's research group also focuses on the biological activity of natural products and their analogs for medicinal purposes.

Description and history The Samuel Parsons House is located in a residential area south of downtown Wallingford, on the east side of South Main Street. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gambrel roof, end chimneys, and a clapboarded exterior. The first floor facade is five bays wide, with sash windows arranged symmetrically around the center entrance. The entrance is sheltered by a 19th-century gabled porch with square columns. Three gabled dormers pierce the steep front face of the roof. The interior has original finishes in most of its downstairs rooms, and its upper level has been opened up to create a museum gallery. With The house has an uncertain construction history, and is currently believed to have been built about 1770, based on stylistic evidence. Uncertain documentary evidence suggests it may have been built as early as 1759, but this assumes that the documents refer to the same building. The house was probably built by John Parsons, and is named for his grandson Samuel, who owned it by 1803. By the turn of the 20th century, a wing had been added to one side, and the building had been converted into a two-family residence.

Her subjects included President William McKinley, Andrew Carnegie, and George Frederick Watts, among others. Cadwalader-Guild spent much of her career abroad and achieved particular notoriety in England and Germany. Cadwalader-Guild works were exhibited at numerous locations, including the Royal Academy of Arts, the 1894 Paris Salon, the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition, and the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, also known as the 1904 St. Louis, or Louisiana Exposition, where she won a bronze medal. Cadwalader-Guild primarily worked in marble and bronze.  Life and career  Cadwalader-Guild was born in Zanesville, Ohio in 1843. The variations on Cadwalader-Guild's name are attributed to differences between the English and American spellings. Cadwalader-Guild's father was part of the English Cadwallader family. Her father was a doctor. While young, Cadwalader- Guild showed an interest in art, as her mother painted with oils and watercolors in a studio in their home. On October 8, 1861, Cadwalader-Guild married Reverend Edward Chipman Guild of the Unitarian church. The pair had two children, Eliza and Rose. After her marriage, Cadwalader-Guild realized her love and talent for art while she and her husband were living in Boston where she spent time with local artists in their studios. Her first recorded exhibition was in 1876 at the Women's Pavilion of the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition, while she was living in Waltham, Massachusetts. Reports note she was inspired to take up sculpting when she came across an African-American man at a market. Cadwalader-Guild spent weeks molding her own rendition of the man, which became known as Free or Freed. Another source attests that her first great work was a lifesize David in clay she completed in 1875. A bronze bust of Abraham Lincoln done by Emma Cadwalader-Guild. Cadwalader-Guild had no formal training and was self-taught. She attended William Rimmer's anatomy lectures as her only formal instruction. She was also known for working without models. Portraiture was her primary subject matter; however, Cadwalader-Guild did create other forms. Her historical subjects include an Endyimon in marble and a corresponding bronze statuette, a marble bust of Lotos/Lotus, a bust of the Head of St. Monica, the mother of St. Augustine, a marble figure of Electron/Electro/Elektron, and Psyche. Her historical subjects were praised for their originality and craftsmanship. Though her primary work was sculpture, she also painted, though mostly without patronage. Her focus was on still lives and landscapes. She also painted a series of oil sketches. Cadwalader-Guild often had showings of her work in her studio. Once Free was completed, Cadwalader-Guild moved abroad in the mid-1880s, exhibiting and working in multiple cities. She placed Free in her London studio, where it was well-received by critics. She traveled and study the masters of art and opened studios in cities with strong art communities, including London, Berlin, Italy, and Frankfurt, to increase the profitability of her travels. While in Europe, she produced pieces that were well-received and brought her recognition including marble and bronze busts of British Prime Minister William Gladstone, who contacted her for in-person sittings, something he had not done with any other sculptor. She returned to the United States at an unknown date to make a bust of President McKinley at the encouragement of then-United States Ambassador Andrew White. Cadwalader-Guild had long wanted to create a study of her fellow Ohioan. However, McKinley did not arrive to the scheduled sittings in the summer due to the campaign of 1900. She returned to Berlin and came back to the United States the following summer to meet McKinley in Canton, Ohio where he was staying. Again McKinley was too busy to pose for sittings but promised to sit for her when he returned to Washington D.C. in October. However, McKinley was assassinated in September 1901 and Cadwalader-Guild made the bust from photographs. Congress purchased the bust for $2,000. It was placed in the President's Room in the Capitol and moved to the Senate Marble Room in 2000. A bronze bust of G.F. Watts by Emma Cadwalader-Guild. From 1885 to 1888 her primary address was in London. The Royal Academy in London listed her 1888 address as in Frankfurt and in 1891, Hamburg, and in 1893, Berlin. The 1894 Paris Salon listed a London address. By 1897 she had relocated the majority of her work to Berlin where her work consisted mostly of portraiture of nobility. At the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition she is listed as still working in Berlin. Prior to December 1905 Cadwalader-Guild purportedly spent several years in England. During this time she made her busts of Gladstone and other notable figures including royalty. Another report attests that prior to March 1905 Cadwalader-Guild spent several years in Berlin before returning to America to work in the Bryant Park Building. At that time she was working on the bust of an unknown but prominent New York resident. Little is known of Cadwalader-Guild's death but that it occurred around 1911, and in the United States.  Notable work and exhibitions  A portrait bust of Princess Helene of Sachsen-Altenburg by Emma Cadwalader-Guild. Cadwalader-Guild exhibited at the Royal Academy multiple times throughout her career.

Her sculpture Lotos was lauded in the German Times as, \\"This psychic masterpiece stamps Mrs. Guild unequivocally as an artist of the very first rank.\\" Cadwalader-Guild's bust of Joseph Joachim was also complimented by the German Times, saying, \\"[the bust is] by far the best and most significant work accomplished by any of the small army of sculptors who have been moved to do the violin-patriarch's characteristic head.\\" Her marble study of Wilhelmina of the Netherlands so impressed Empress Augusta Victoria that when she saw it on public display, she ordered it to be taken to the palace. Princess Sophia of Saxe-Weimar, Wilhelmina's aunt, had Cadwalader-Guild make a duplicate as a coronation gift for Wilhelmina. United States politician John Hay described her bust of President McKinley as, \\"The power of the head is remarkable. It is a great expression of the personality of the man.\\" In an article about Cadwalader- Guild the Boston Evening Transcript wrote, \\"...the work of Mrs. Guild shows unmistakable talent and such as fresh, free spirit of originality that one can almost accept the alleged dictum of Berlin that Mrs. Guild 'is the greatest genius in sculpture that America has ever had.'\\" Her bronze statuette Endymion was complimented in the 1896 Studio International with, \\"...since the Italian bronzes of the Quattrocento no finer work of the kind has been seen than this.\\" Similarly, upon the completion of her marble Endymion a complimentary piece was written in The International Studio which focused on the originality, pose, and composition of the sculpture. An author for The International Studio wrote about the skill of her paintings in the journal's November 1897 to February 1898 volume, saying, \\"Mrs. Guild has a strong predilection for painting...which she does with no small degree of success, as her free and vigorous landscape studies abundantly testify...This pronounced feeling of hers for colour explains to me how in... her sculpture she employs means which really overstep the bounds of plastic art.\\" Notes  References   External links  * Letters exchanged between Cadwalader- Guild and artist Thomas Rossiter at the Smithsonian Archives 1843 births 19th-century American women artists American women sculptors Artists from Ohio People from Zanesville, Ohio 1910s deaths ","title":"Emma Cadwalader-Guild"},{"id":"58761423","text":"The Langham Estate is a property estate in Fitzrovia, London, and is owned by the Mount Eden Land Limited (Guernsey). The company controls 14 acres of real estate in central London.  Background  Great Portland Street as seen in the early 1900s The Langham Estate originates from an entity first established in 1925 to manage a holding of 40 acres of land purchased from the Howard de Walden Estate in central London.The Howard de Walden Estate is said to have sold 40 acres in East Marylebone in anticipation of high death duty obligations. The properties, acquired for ¬£3m and located in eastern Marylebone,The 1925 land acquisition price of ¬£3m is roughly equivalent to ¬£177m in 2018.

Under Sir John Ellerman, the holdings covered almost all Great Portland Street, and much of streets alongside it (including Hallam, Bolsover, Margaret and Great Titchfield Streets). Numerous holdings on Great Portland Street were divested over the years. The Langham Estate operates in an area noted for its media connections, restaurants, design showrooms and art galleries. The Langham Estate was described in 2017 as being one of London's 16 Great Estates with its footprint of 13.8 acres of central London property. Many of the entity's original properties are still held‚Äîbut now in the form of freehold as their long leases have been sold off. Samuel Tak Lee of Hong Kong is said to be its owner. Mr Lee reportedly sought control of Shaftesbury PLC's neighbouring 15 acre estate until his interests in it were sold in June 2020.  Recent Developments  Great Portland Street is long known for its shops and restaurants The Fitzrovia real estate market has been undergoing a renewal. The area has witnessed significant increase in rents and rates along with markedly higher occupant turnovers. Property values have increased in part due to changes in planning constraints, along with the impact of the Cross Rail and Oxford Street projects, which were projected to increase commercial activity in the area. The company markets some of its properties under the banners of Noho and/or FitzNovia to describe an area just north of Oxford Street and just west of Regent Street. The company website states the company holds a \\"1.3 million sq feet (29 acre) mixed portfolio of office, showroom, retail, restaurant, bar, residential and storage\\" properties. A neighbourhood plan is being developed for Langham Estate's Fitzrovia area. This is being done in consultation with stakeholders, the Langham Estate and other local landlords, businesses and residents. The plan focused on improving the local amenity, affordable housing provision, poor broadband data services and air pollution conditions.

It was uncovered in 2018 after translation of 92 cuneiform tablets. The tablets were discovered in summer 2017, near the Kurdish village of Bassetki, by a team of archaeologists. The team hailed from T√ºbingen's Institute for Ancient Near Eastern Studies, and were led by Prof. Dr. Peter Pf√§lzner of the University of T√ºbingen. History The city was continuously occupied between 3000 and 600 BC, but the earliest reference dates to the reign of Naram-Sin of Akkad, the son of Manishtushu. The city joined under its ruler Duhsusu in the \\"Great Revolt\\" against the third Akkadian king. The city was destroyed, but was later rebuilt and is mentioned by sources from the Third Dynasty of Ur in around 2100 -2000 BC as an important city on Mesopotamia's northern boarder. The city was then the center of a kingdom, and was captured by Shamshi-Adad I in 1786. After his fall, the city became an independent kingdom under the Hurrian ruler Tish-ulme. A never dispatched letter, meant to have been sent to Tishe-ulme from Zimri-Lim, requested that he hand over the city to Zimri-Lim, who would give it to a local ruler loyal to him. The relations with Mari seem to have been hostile, also seen in Mardaman's support for Hadnum. The latter changed its alliance from Zimri-Lim to the city of Kurda. Haqba-Hammu, the ruler of Karana and ally of Mari, invaded Hadnum in retaliation, with 2,000 men. Even relief forces from Mardama could not prevent the capturing of five cities of Hadnum. Another letter in the Mari archives informed Zimri-Lim of the conquest of Mardaman by his allies Quarni-Lim of Andarig and Sharraya of northern Razama. Mardaman suffered another sacking by the Turukkaeans, a mountain people from the Zagros Mountains to the north, around 1769/1768. During the Middle Assyrian Empire, the city had a final period of prosperity as a governor's seat between 1250 and 1200 BC. Clay tablets indicate the name of the governor, Assur-nasir and list some of his activities. Archaeology The ruins of a Bronze Age city in Bassetki were discovered in 2013 during field search of the University of T√ºbingen. The excavations were led by Prof. Dr. Peter Pf√§lzner and Dr. Hasan Quasim of the archaeological department in Duhok. In 2016, it was discovered that the city had a wall from c. 2700 BC protecting the upper city and an extensive road network, several residential districts and a palatial building. A temple dedicated to Adad, a Mesopotamian weather god, evidently existed there. In summer 2017, the archaeologists excavated 92 tablets dating to the Middle Assyrian Empire, about 1,250 BC in a ceramic vessel that was protected by a thick layer of clay, possibly for storing of the included tablets. The small, partially broken tablets were deciphered by Dr. Betina Faist, who identified Mardaman.

Incident On Monday 15 October 2018 at 12:30 German time the Syrian refugee Mohammed Abo R. entered a McDonald's fast food restaurant at the Cologne Central Station with a bag and a suitcase. In the restaurant he sat down at a table, drew a pistol, and spilled a flammable liquid on the floor. Shortly thereafter, he took a Molotov cocktail from his suitcase, ignited it and set the floor of the restaurant on fire. The fire ignited the clothes of a 14-year-old German girl, who ran out of the restaurant in a panic. Passersby quickly extinguished the girl's burning clothes, who, despite the rapid reaction of the passersby, suffered severe burns to her legs. Surprised by the triggered fire sprinkler system, Mohammed had meanwhile fled the fast food restaurant and, armed with his gun, stormed into an adjacent pharmacy, where he took an employee hostage. At 12:45 German time the first emergency calls reached the police. The police quickly evacuated the station and cordoned off the surrounding area. On the phone, the perpetrator stated his demands: Free passage to Syria, the release of a Tunisian woman and the return of his suitcase and bag from the McDonald's. He claimed to be a member of ISIL. A two hour standoff led to no peaceful solution. The perpetrator in the meanwhile had poured gasoline over his hostage, put a Molotov cocktail in her hand and a lighter in her mouth. When he tried to set her on fire, the police attacked. At 14:55 German time a SEK team detonated two stun grenades, stormed the pharmacy and shot the perpetrator, who was still armed with his pistol. Three police officers fired a total of six rounds at Mohammed, of which several hit his upper body and one hit him in the head. The hostage was carried from the pharmacy and handed over to paramedics. Mohammed was dragged by the SEK Members to the square in front of the pharmacy, where CPR was applied and his wounds were treated by police medics.  Victims  During the incident a total of three victims were wounded, some of them seriously  The Hostage  The hostage was treated in a clinic after the incident. She suffered a shock and a gasoline poisoning. On Wednesday she was able to leave the hospital.  Lika M.  The 14-year-old German girl Lika M., whose clothes were caught on fire by R.¬¥s Molotov cocktail, was seriously injured. 10 percent of her skin was burned. She was treated in a children's hospital in Cologne. Eight surgeries and two skin transplants later she was able to leave the hospital in December 2018. Doctors expect her to make a full recovery.  Another Victim  The fire department reported another victim. This person suffered smoke inhalation, but was able to leave the hospital on the same day.  Investigation   Crime Scene Investigation  In the McDonald's, the bag and suitcase of the perpetrator were examined and declared safe by EOD Operators. Further Molotov cocktails, containers with a flammable liquid and several IEDs were found in the bags. The IEDs were gas cartridges modified with steel balls for maximum destruction. In the pharmacy the investigators found further containers with flammable liquid and further IEDs. Furthermore, a airsoft pistol and an identity document were seized.  Search of the Perpetrator's Apartment  In the evening of the same day, R.'s apartment was stormed and searched by the police. This happened especially in view of a possible terrorist attack and other perpetrators. Large quantities of gasoline and Arabic characters were found in the apartment. The characters are not related to Islamism or ISIL. Multiple electronic devices were seized in the apartment including two mobile phones.  Terrorism  In the beginning terrorism was a possible motive. During the investigation kept going no evidence of relations between Mohammed Abo R. and terrorism were found. The case was ruled non terrorism related.  Mental health issues  After terrorism was ruled out, it was determined that Mohammed suffered from mental health issues. They found that he had been in psychotherapy since 2017 and was taking medication to combat depression. He was also suffering from gambling and drug addiction. Legal proceedings Police stated that they could not rule out a terror attack.Geiselnehmer soll gedroht haben, Frau anzuz√ºnden, Welt.deGeiselnahme in K√∂ln k√∂nnte terroristischen Hintergrund haben, Frankfurter Allgemeine The Cologne prosecutor's office charged Mohammed Abo R. with two counts of attempted murder, aggravated battery and hostage-taking.

In June 2019, his pre-trial detention was suspended for six months and he was transferred to a specialist neurological clinic.

Introduction  Since the 1920s, the People's Commissariat for Education has organized short courses (2‚Äì6 months long) for school teachers. In those years, the Commissariat decided to create home pedagogical technical schools. These technical schools (that involved 1500 teachers) were established in 1927 with the purpose of training teachers with secondary special education. On October 1, 1929, in accordance with the Decision of the Board of the Branch of People's Commissariat for Education of the Azerbaijan SSR dated July 13, 1929, the Azerbaijan Institute of Advanced Studies of the Personnel of Public Education was opened. The Institute included home pedagogical technical schools, a former pedagogical faculty, and correspondence methodical courses. Initially, the Institute was only engaged in the retraining of pedagogical personnel, which was conducted through correspondence and short-term courses. The retraining was covered by educators of all categories. In 1939, the Institute for Advanced Studies of the Personnel of Public Education was replaced by the Republican Institute for Advanced Studies of Teachers. In 1972, it was also reorganized into the Azerbaijan Central Institute for Advanced Studies of Teachers. By the decision of the Council of Ministers of Azerbaijan SSR No. 398 dated October 4, 1989, improvement was sought for the system of advanced training of the public education employees. The Azerbaijan Central Institute of Advanced Training for Teachers was reorganized into the Institute of Advanced Training and Retraining of Teachers. It was given the status of higher education I category. The Institute moved to the cathedral system and faculties were organized for the implementation of work on advanced training. In 2000, by the Decree of the President of Azerbaijan No. 349, the Azerbaijan Institute of Teachers was established with 12 branches in the Nakhichevan, Ganja, Sumgait, Mingechevir, Gazakh, Shamakhi, Quba, Salyan, Jalilabad, Agjabedi, Sheki, Zagatala and with a training and advisory center in Lankaran. In a short time, the Nakhchivan branch has become an independent Institution of teachers.  Structure  The Azerbaijan Teachers\` Institute includes faculties such as Pedagogy and Philology, Further training and improvement of teaching staff, Psychology, Literature and teaching methods, Azerbaijani language and its teaching methods, Foreign languages, Natural sciences and methods of their teaching, Mathematics and teaching methods, Social Sciences, Information Technologies and methods of their teaching, Education management and vocational training, Methods of primary and preschool education and Civil Defense, Basics of medical knowledge and physical education The Azerbaijan Teachers\` Institute (ATI) and its branches operate in the following areas: * Primary teacher training (bachelor's degree) * Professional development of teaching staff * Retraining of teaching staff * Improving teachers Currently 1079 employees work in the branches, of which 533 are faculty members. The Institute has 260 employees, of which 119 are faculty members. The institute has 3 faculties, 12 departments, a fundamental library, and a computer center.  International relations  On August 27, 2011, a memorandum of understanding was signed between Azerbaijan Teachers\` Institute and the Pakistani University of Punjab. Within the framework of the MoU conferences, training, visits, seminars, etc. are organized, the students of the institutions can exchange their experiences. In the same year on June 23, an academic agreement on organizing teacher and student exchange on training, implementing programs and joining international training was signed between the Azerbaijan Teachers\` Institute and Atat√ºrk University of Turkey with 43,000 students.
