These sequences can be ligated to one another, but then form an asymmetrical sequence that cannot be cleaved by a restriction enzyme.  Examples  For example the enzymes Mbo I and BamH I are isocaudomers: Mbo I N*GATC N N CTAG*N BamH I G*GATC C C CTAG*G N represents any of the four nucleotides. Independently of which nucleotide is present when cleaving with MboI, after cleavage with either enzyme, all termini have the central tetranucleotide - GATC. This allows fragments generated with one enzyme to anneal with fragments generated with the other enzyme. This can be used for elimination of restriction sites from the resulting DNA fragment. For example: Not I GC*GGCC GC CG CCGG*CG Bsp120 I G*GGCC C C CCGG*G In the above example, both enzymes produce tetranucleotides CCGG which can anneal to one another.

History Harvey Cedars Bible Conference has occupied the former, historic Harvey Cedars Hotel since the early 1940s (although it was first called Harvey Cedars Bible Presbyterian Conference). It officially opened on August 3, 1941. Presbyterian minister Jack Murray purchased the old hotel, which was abandoned for around 10 years, and converted it into Harvey Cedars Bible Presbyterian Conference. After around 10 years of directing the conference, Jack left the operations to Al Oldham. The name was changed to Harvey Cedars Bible Conference by 1949 while Jack Murray was still involved, and was run by Al until the mid-1990s when the director position was passed on to his son, Jon Oldham. Originally a small one story hotel started in the 1830s for fishermen and hunters, it was expanded throughout the 19th century to a two-story. A large renovation, completed in 1903, led to the three-story structure which was kept rather similar until the late 1990s when sections of it were gutted and rebuilt, out of style with the original Victorian architecture. In 1949/1950, a separate chapel was built on the property. Stained glass windows purchased from the Engleside Hotel in Beach Haven (built in the 1870s, and torn down during World War II) were used in the new chapel. These windows were, with the exception of two sashes, completely removed years later after years of damage from the high winds. Two of the old sashes remained in the bookstore, off the chapel, until around 2003 when they were also removed. The HCBC complex also contains a modern hotel, a 1960s motel- style building, separate dining hall, a dock and elevated bayside deck, tennis courts, an indoor heated swimming pool, an indoor hot tub, a gymnasium, volleyball court, and soccer fields.  Current Ministry  The Bible Conference has a long history of Biblically oriented ministries and vacations for families and people of all ages and ethnicities. The summers feature week- long Family Weeks and Teen Weeks. The rest of the year is filled with weekend retreats for different organizations, including at least one retreat which brings in hundreds from other countries.  Renovations  Changing times, expectations for improved accommodations and guest amenities led to decisions to renovate in the 1990s, up to the present time. The former bar, (which during the first days of Harvey Cedars Bible Presbyterian Conference served as a lounge, and during the 1980s and 1990s served as the staff lounge, was rebuilt as office space containing 4 rooms around 1996/1997 (several years later the porch on the north end of the former bar was also altered for further office space). The decorative steel ceiling may have been removed‚Äîit was at least covered by a drop ceiling. This bar originally contained one of a set of matching decorative fireplaces completed in 1903 after the major renovation. The matching decorative fireplace in the former South Lounge was removed around 2004 when the South Lounge was completely remodeled. The decorative, functional south porches were also removed, on the first floor to extend former South lounge into needed meeting rooms. On the 2nd and 3rd floor, the former porches were replaced mostly by a concrete block fireproof stairwell. The former dining room (which has served as the main lounge since the 1940s) has been kept mostly original. All the exterior old windows were replaced, but the decorative embossed-steel walls and ceiling are still present. This room originally had gas light fixtures which were removed long ago. The pocket doors on the south side were covered, but are still in the walls. Also on the first floor, the former \\"Woman's Lounge\\" during the Hotel days (which served as the \\"Game Room\\" during the early Harvey Cedar's Bible (Presbyterian) Conference days, followed by living quarters for staff in the 1990s) was gutted and converted into modern bathrooms around 2004. On the north side of the hotel the old back stairway which extended from the first floor (former kitchen) to the attic was removed. A concrete block fireproof stairwell was added to the north and south side to adhere to New Jersey fire code. On the second floor, many guest rooms were gutted and renovated. Some restrooms were also gutted and renovated. All other historic hotels of the same size located on the island have long since been destroyed. For more old photographs of the old hotel, see Harvey Cedars Hotel and Camp Whelen as they occupied the same building during different eras. Namesake A significant signpost in the history of the Bible Presbyterian Church was the publication and approval of what came to be known as the Harvey Cedars Resolutions. In 1945 the Eighth General Synod of the BPC convened at the denomination's conference center in Harvey Cedars, New Jersey. Thus the name applied to the resolutions. With its approval, the Bible Presbyterian Church codified much of what had already characterized the denomination, namely its stance on the twin issues of personal and ecclesial separation.

Atomic tourism is a recent form of tourism in which visitors learn about the Atomic Age by traveling to significant sites in atomic history such as museums with atomic weapons, missile silos, vehicles that carried atomic weapons or sites where atomic weapons were detonated. In the United States, the Center for Land Use Interpretation has conducted tours of the Nevada Test Site, Trinity Site, Hanford Site, and other historical atomic age sites, to explore the cultural significance of these Cold War nuclear zones. The book Overlook: Exploring the Internal Fringes of America describes the purpose of this tourism as \\"windows into the American psyche, landmarks that manifest the rich ambiguities of the nation's cultural history.\\" A Bureau of Atomic Tourism was proposed by American photographer Richard Misrach and writer Myriam Weisang Misrach in 1990. The phenomenon is not exclusive to North America. Visitors to the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone often visit the nearly deserted city of Pripyat. The Hiroshima Peace Memorial (Genbaku Dome), which survived the destruction of Hiroshima, is now a UNESCO World Heritage site at the center of Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. Bikini Atoll was at one time the site of a diving tourism initiative. As of 2012, China planned to build a tourist destination at its first atomic test site, the Malan Base at Lop Nur in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. During the early atomic age when fission was viewed as a sign of progress and modernity, the city of Las Vegas and its Chamber of Commerce nicknamed Vegas as the \\"Atomic City\\" in the mid 1940s and early 1950s in an attempt to attract tourists. So called \\"bomb viewing parties\\" took place on desert hilltops, or more famously at the panoramic Sky Room at the Desert Inn, and casinos held Miss Atomic pageants while serving Atomic Cocktails.< Tri-Cities Visitor and Convention Bureau tour of the Hanford Site (7597549756) Boarding the bus for Chernobyl (11383815603) NNSA-NSO-736 Atomic museums Research and production * Los Alamos Historical Museum, Los Alamos, New Mexico -

It evolved from the original \\"manual protection\\" system in which the program would require the user to enter a specific word from the manual before the game would start up or continue beyond a certain point. This system was popular because it allowed the actual media to be backed up and replaced freely while retaining security, but with the increased availability of photocopiers, those wishing to distribute the games simply started copying their manuals as well to defeat the measure. Although whole code wheels could not be directly photocopied, the component wheels could be disassembled and individually photocopied; these components could then be crafted together into a duplicate wheel. The contents of code wheels could also be copied onto paper and the user of an unlicensed copy could simply apply a mathematical formula to the presented challenges to calculate the correct response. Once a suitable formula was found, code wheels actually made the process of copying easier since the amount of information they could contain was low compared to a manual of potentially unlimited size. Thus, code wheels were rapidly phased out in favor of regular manual protection and protection based around color, as public access to color photocopying at the time was expensive and uncommon. This was itself made obsolete by a return to protection based on the game media itself, when CD- ROMs were introduced. Code wheel forms A code wheel itself is a physical object consisting of several circular sheets of paper or card of different sizes, fastened in the center, creating a set of concentric circles. The game issues the user with a set of challenges (symbols, words, or other identifiers), which instruct the user in how to manipulate the wheel in order to reveal a response, a single symbol or word that the user must enter in order to start the game. Entering anything other than the expected response would result in the game halting or performing other behaviour associated with unauthorised usage of the software (for example, the game Starflight would send unbeatable \\"police ships\\" to destroy the player's spaceship). 2-ply A simple 2-ply code wheel consisted of two circular sheets, both with challenge symbols printed at intervals around the rim, and with the back sheet containing a table of responses printed to fit to the circle, and the front sheet a series of holes allowing the responses to be viewed, each hole labelled with a challenge symbol. The computer would present three challenge symbols, and the user would read the response by rotating the front sheet until the first two challenge symbols were aligned with each other on the rim of the wheel, then read the response from the hole indicated by the third challenge symbol. This type of codewheel was used for a large number of games, such as Neuromancer, and Cybercon 3 (which used a code wheel printed on carbon paper). Single-ply There was one usage of a single-ply code wheel, where only two challenge symbols were used; in the Amiga game Rocket Ranger, the player turned the wheel to match their Ranger's current location, then read a value from the hole corresponding to the location where they wanted to fly to. The holes were in a simple column. Since this was the only mechanism for the player to specify where they wanted to fly, it was impossible for crackers to remove it from the game without destroying the entire gameplay. 3-ply A 3-ply code wheel, used in games such as Star Control and The Fool's Errand, retained the back wheel with printed responses and the front wheel with holes, and added further \\"middle\\" wheels between the front and back which contained a mixture of printed responses and further holes that allowed the next wheel to show through when particular challenge symbols were aligned External links Interactive code wheels online on OldGames.sk Category:Authentication methods Category:Copy protection ","title":"Code wheel"},{"id":"7172944","text":"\\"Dirty Second Hands\\" is a song from Switchfoot's sixth studio album Oh! Gravity. This was the first song released from the album, made available for purchase online as a single. Despite this, the song was never released to radio. When the band first posted the song for streaming on their web site, it contained several differences from the album version. The first verse was backed by an electric guitar section which on the album version does not appear until the second verse. The chorus also did not have the brief electric guitar dropout between vocal lines. Unlike the album version, this version was significantly shorter because it did not contain the vocal portion of the bridge. A few days later this version of the song was replaced by the final album version. \\"Dirty Second Hands\\" was produced & recorded at Bigfish Studio by John Fields. As per executive producer Steve Lillywhite's suggestion, the earliest rough mix from the day the song was tracked was used on the album. Live This song was introduced into the band's live show during the Fall 2006 leg of the Oh! Gravity. Tour prior to the album's release and quickly became a concert favorite. The concert version of the song features an extended instrumental coda which includes frontman Jon Foreman wildly beating a suspended cymbal and climaxes in a distorted guitar solo by Drew Shirley. The light show for this guitar solo during the Appetite for Construction Tour incorporated large amounts of unsynchronized strobe lights, increasing the dramatic effect. The coda closes with an instrumental reprise of the chorus riff, at the end of which the band suddenly cuts off. Structure The song uses unusual time signatures, the intro being in 5/4 with the last bar in 3/4. The chorus is first in 3/4 for three bars and then a bar of 2/4 followed by two bars of 5/4, while the verse is in 5/4. The breakdown is in 4/4 on the drums. Other appearances The song also appears as a track from Dave Matthews Band's tour sampler, So Much to Save.Switchfoot's \\"Dirty Second Hands\\" featured on Dave Matthews compilation album - Published August 18, 2009 (retrieved August 18, 2009) An early version is also found on their late 2010 EP Eastern Hymns for Western Shores.

It derives its name from a voyage the protagonist takes to that faraway land in the west. Plot summary The novel's protagonist is Ranald Sigmundson, an Orkneyman who journeys to Vinland as a youth, fights in the battle of Clontarf, and has other adventures. Later in life, Ranald tends his farm and warns his family and friends against becoming too involved in worldly affairs. The story's prose style is quite minimalistic and vivid, after the manner of an ancient Norse saga. It is, like much of Brown's other work, a revival of that literary form. Written at a time when Brown's health was wavering, Vinland is a rare autobiographical insight into the author's thoughts about death. Like Ranald Sigmundsson, Brown converted to a Christian mentality. In the novel, Ranald yearns for a final voyage back to Vinland. However, the voyage is metaphorical: he dies on Easter Monday, and therefore his voyage is a spiritual rather than a physical one. What Vinland represents is echoed throughout Brown's work in his search for 'silence', that is, a sense for Christian peace, unity, meaning and order. He uses the Vikings' belief in fate (wyrd) as a backdrop to his message for Christian order. Ranald starts to despise the Viking way of life, and he soon turns very introspective and isolated, contemplating the meaning of life along emerging Christian principles. In short, his final voyage to the 'west' is a voyage to heaven, to an Eden ‚Äì a harmonious world that was lost when the mythological representative of the apocalyptical hound Fenrir, Wolf, swings his axe and kills a Native American, destroying any hope of reconciliation.

He is a retired United States Air Force intelligence officer with experience in the Middle East, including tours of duty with the National Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency. He was under contract to NBC News and appeared regularly on NBC, MSNBC and CNBC, as well as Radio Canada and other media. In 2013, he became a military analyst with CNN. Background Francona served for over 27 years in the U.S. Air Force, most of it in the Middle East. Fluent in Arabic, he served in the region with the National Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency. He has a bachelor's degree from Chapman College (now Chapman University) in Government and the Arabic language, and a master's degree from Troy State University in International Relations with a concentration in Middle East studies. He is a cousin of the current Cleveland Indians manager Terry Francona. Francona and his wife Emily, also a retired Air Force intelligence officer, reside in Port Orford, Oregon. Military service Francona enlisted in the United States Air Force in 1970, and served as a Vietnamese linguist until 1973, conducting combat aerial reconnaissance missions over Vietnam and Laos in a variety of strategic and tactical aircraft. After Arabic language training, he served at a variety of locations in the Middle East from 1975 to 1977, and supported the evacuation of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon in 1976. In 1978, he became an Arabic language instructor at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California. Following his commissioning in 1979, Francona was an instructor at the Air Force Intelligence School in Denver, Colorado. From 1982 to 1984, he was a Middle East operations officer with the National Security Agency in the United States and overseas. In 1984, he was assigned as an advisor to the Royal Jordanian Air Force in Amman, Jordan. In 1987, he was assigned to the Defense Intelligence Agency as the assistant defense intelligence officer for the Middle East. During this assignment, he spent much of 1987 and 1988 at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, as a liaison officer to the Iraqi armed forces Directorate of Military Intelligence. Francona worked an observer of Iraqi combat operations against Iranian forces, and flew sorties with the Iraqi Air Force. His observations were key to the discovery of Iraqi chemical weapons capabilities and ballistic missile modifications. Sultan Hashim Ahmad at Gulf War ceasefire talks, Safwan, Iraq, March 3, 1991 Immediately following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 and through the Gulf War, Francona was deployed to the Gulf as an interpreter and advisor on Iraqi armed forces to commander in chief of the U.S. Central Command, General Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr. As such, he was the lead interpreter for ceasefire talks with the Iraqi military at Safwan, Iraq, in March 1991. After the end of the Gulf War, Francona served in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and was a principal author of the Department of Defense report to Congress on the conduct of the Gulf war. In 1992, he was selected to be the first air attach√© to the U.S. Embassy in Damascus, Syria, returning to the United States in 1995. From 1995 to 1996, Francona served with the Central Intelligence Agency, and participated in a variety of sensitive operations in the Middle East. During one of these operations, he survived an attempt on his life by Iraqi Intelligence Service agents. He was later awarded the CIA Bronze Seal Medallion for his service to the CIA. In 1996, he was selected to lead the development of a Joint Services counterterrorism intelligence branch. As a direct result of the success in creating this special Task Force, he was asked to lead a special operations team supporting NATO forces in Bosnia in late 1997. He returned to the United States and retired from active duty in 1998. His decorations include the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Bronze Star, and nine Air Medals, as well as campaign awards for service in Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, and the Balkans. Francona was awarded the Central Intelligence Agency Seal Medallion for his service with that agency. In 2006, Francona was inducted into the Defense Language Institute Hall of Fame. Commentary Francona is a media analyst on Middle East political-military events, formerly under contract to NBC News and appeared regularly on NBC Nightly News, the Today Show, MSNBC, Hardball with Chris Matthews, Scarborough Country, Countdown with Keith Olbermann, and others. He also writes articles for MSNBC, the Council on Foreign Relations, and his blog at Middle East Perspectives. He frequently speaks to conventions and public service audiences. In 2010, Francona appeared as a subject matter expert on the Iraqi military and Saddam Hussein in an episode of Spike TV's \\"Who is the Deadliest Warrior.\\" In 2013, he began working as a military analyst for CNN, commenting on the Syrian civil war and chemical warfare issues, and in 2014 on the deteriorating situation in Iraq. Pentagon military analyst program In April 2008, documents obtained by New York Times reporter David Barstow revealed that Francona had been recruited as one of over 75 retired military officers involved in the Pentagon military analyst program. Participants appeared on television and radio news shows as military analysts, and/or penned newspaper op/ed columns. The program was launched in early 2002 by then-Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Victoria Clarke. The idea was to recruit \\"key influentials\\" to help sell a wary public on \\"a possible Iraq invasion.\\"David Barstow, \\"Behind Analysts, the Pentagon's Hidden Hand,\\" New York Times, April 20, 2008.

Hollace Weiner of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram said in 1996 that the school was a \\"scholastically touted institution that draws students from private schools.\\"  History  Arlington Heights High School was established in 1922 and hosted 715 students in its inaugural year. The current building was built in 1937. Originally, students from this area attended Stripling High School in the 1920s, which is now a feeder middle school. Heights was generally affluent and white until the late 1960s, hosting many children of notable citizens of Fort Worth such as the Belknaps and Dickeys, as well as Governor Connally's children. African American students attended Como High School, which no longer exists and was merged with Arlington Heights at its closing. Students at Arlington Heights referred to their school as \\"The Hill\\", as the main building offers a view of the Trinity River valley to the south, from which AHHS is visible for miles. Notable incidents In 1979, a Paschal High School student (and son of a county Commissioner) stole a bulldozer from a County construction site, drove it up Hulen Street and rammed it into the Arlington Heights High School Field House the day before the annual Heights-Paschal football game, completely leveling the field house.https://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/1985/july/doomsday/ Doomsday \\"D\\" Magazine This resulted in criminal convictions and a nationwide reassessment of safety and security measures, as well as beginning a national discussion about youth violence and vandalism on many national television and radio programs.

The first game between the teams took place on November 25, 1897. Notre Dame leads the all-time series 47‚Äì29‚Äì1. Since 1949, the teams competed for the Megaphone Trophy, a trophy introduced by the Alumni Clubs of Notre Dame and Michigan State to be presented to the winner of the game. Notre Dame leads the Megaphone Trophy series 33‚Äì27‚Äì1. The Notre Dame side of the trophy is blue, while the Michigan State side is green, and the year of the game and teams' respective scores running down the middle. The current trophy is the third trophy as the prior two trophies no longer have space for the respective games to be included. The rivalry includes several notable games, such as the 1966 game, arguably one of the greatest college football games ever played. Notre Dame currently leads the series. Games played prior to 1949 also appear on the trophy to commemorate the entire series.College Football's Unusual Trophies Sports Illustrated Notre Dame is the current holder of the trophy, with a 38‚Äì18 victory on September 23, 2017. They will hold the Megaphone Trophy until 2026 when the two teams are scheduled to play again. Recent games After an 8‚Äì0 series run by Notre Dame from 1987 to 1994, tying the series win streak set by Michigan State from 1955 to 1963 (they didn't meet in 1958), Michigan State won five games in a row. Michigan State won 44‚Äì41 in double overtime at Notre Dame in 2005. Notre Dame pulled out a thrilling come from behind 40‚Äì37 victory in East Lansing in 2006. The trend continued in 2007 for Michigan State under new head coach Mark Dantonio who defeated the Fighting Irish 31‚Äì14, recording MSU's sixth straight victory at Notre Dame. On September 20, 2008, MSU defeated Notre Dame 23‚Äì7 in East Lansing, ending the series \\"jinx\\" of home teams always losing since 2001. Notre Dame returned the favor the following year by defeating MSU at Notre Dame. The 2010 meeting had one of the most exciting finishes to the start of the college football season. A back and forth battle the entire game, Notre Dame took the lead in overtime off of a field goal. After Spartans quarterback Kirk Cousins was sacked on third down, Michigan State lined up for a field goal to tie the game at 31. They faked it, and the holder Aaron Bates tossed a game-winning touchdown pass to Charlie Gantt to win it 34‚Äì31 for the Spartans. In 2011, the Irish reclaimed the trophy with a 31‚Äì13 victory in which they led all the way. Notre Dame's 17‚Äì13 victory in South Bend in 2013 made it three wins in a row for the Irish and was perhaps the most controversial game in memory. The teams renewed the rivalry in 2016, as No. 12 Michigan State reclaimed the trophy by defeating No. 18 Notre Dame in South Bend 36‚Äì28. In 2017, Notre Dame traveled to East Lansing to take on the Spartans once again. Notre Dame quarterback Brandon Wimbush threw for a touchdown and ran for another as Notre Dame routed Michigan State 38‚Äì18. Notre Dame's defense forced three turnovers in the game, including an interception thrown by MSU QB Brian Lewerke. The interception was returned for a touchdown by Irish defensive back Julian Love on MSU's first possession, giving the Irish an early 14‚Äì0 lead. Both teams then swapped touchdown drives. Down 21‚Äì7, Michigan State drove deep into Notre Dame territory, and appeared to score to make it a one touchdown game as running back LJ Scott rumbled into the endzone late in the first half. However, Scott had the ball jarred free at the half-yard line by Notre Dame defensive back Shawn Crawford. Crawford also recovered the forced fumble in the end zone, resulting in a touch back. The play resulted in a 14-point swing, as Notre Dame drove the length of the field in just four plays, taking a commanding 28‚Äì7 lead into halftime off of the three devastating Michigan State turnovers.

Interpretation Helen Vendler (in Words Chosen Out of Desire) presents the poem as a \\"double scherzo\\" on her in the possessive sense and on of in its partitive and possessive sense. The long sequence of possessive phrases Vendler refers to may be enumerated as: 'of the motions', 'of her wrist', 'of her thought', 'of the plumes', 'of this creature', 'of this evening', 'of sails', 'of her fan', 'of the sea', and 'of the evening'. This litany in sequence using the possessive form involving repeated ofs shows syntactically what the poem states semantically, Vendler proposes: the interpenetration of mind and nature, the denial of \\"significant difference\\" among the objects of the various of-clauses. This semantics may be read as a naturalistic denial of metaphysical dualism between mind and matter, a natural twin to the reading of \\"Invective Against Swans\\" as mocking the dualistic soul and its dubious journey to a realm that transcends nature. The princess of the sea in this poem may be compared to \\"donna\\" who is \\"sequestered over the sea\\" in \\"O Florida, Venereal Soil\\", and to \\"Fabliau of Florida\\", which in parallel fashion explores dissolution of boundaries in nature.

The state highway runs from SR 122 at Burnt Chimney north to SR 101 in Roanoke. SR 116 connects northwestern Franklin County with the southeastern part of Roanoke. The state highway forms a major street through Downtown Roanoke and the city's north side. Route description View north near the south end of SR 116 at SR 122 in Burnt Chimney SR 116 begins at an intersection SR 122 (Booker T. Washington Highway) at the hamlet of Burnt Chimney. The state highway heads northwest as Jubal Early Highway, a two-lane road that passes through northwestern Franklin County. After passing through the foothills, SR 116 has a short but steep and curvaceous crossing of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The state highway descends from the summit then has a short climb to Windy Gap, where the highway enters Roanoke County. SR 116 descends to Back Creek and continues northwest as Jae Valley Road, which passes under the Blue Ridge Parkway with no access. The state highway enters the city of Roanoke as Mount Pleasant Boulevard, then veers west as Riverland Road, which parallels the Roanoke River on the northeastern flank of Mill Mountain, down the slope from the Roanoke Star. SR 116 follows Riverland Road to Piedmont Street, onto which the highway turns south for one block to Walnut Street. The state highway uses a viaduct to cross the Roanoke River and the intersection of Norfolk Southern Railway's Winston-Salem and Altavista district rail lines just north of the historic Virginian Railway Passenger Station. Immediately after passing under U.S. Route 220 (US 220) (Roy L. Webber Expressway), SR 116 turns north onto four-lane Jefferson Street to pass through the Old Southwest neighborhood and by the Jefferson College of Health Sciences. SR 116 reaches the southern edge of Downtown Roanoke at Elm Avenue, which heads west as US 221 and east as SR 24. SR 116 and US 221 continue north on Jefferson Street past the Patrick Henry Hotel to Franklin Road, where the highways turn east. After one block on Franklin Road, the highways turn north onto four-lane Williamson Road, on which they head north along the eastern side of Downtown Roanoke. SR 116 and US 221 are joined by US 11 at Campbell Avenue. The three highways expand to a divided highway and cross over Norfolk Southern's Blue Ridge District rail line between the Roanoke Shops to the east and the O. Winston Link Museum and Hotel Roanoke to the west. SR 116, US 221, and US 11 have a partial interchange with Interstate 581 (I-581) and US 220 east of the Gainsboro neighborhood; the interchange features ramps from northbound SR 116 to northbound I-581 and from southbound I-581 to southbound SR 116. The highways pass the Roanoke Civic Center before intersecting Orange Avenue in the middle of the Williamson Road neighborhood. Orange Avenue carries US 460 and U.S. Route 220 Alternate through the intersection, and U.S. Route 11 Alternate west of the intersection. US 11 continues north on Williamson Road, US 221 turns east onto Orange Avenue, and SR 116 turns west onto Orange Avenue. SR 116, US 460, US 11 Alternate, and US 220 Alternate head west as a six-lane boulevard through a cloverleaf interchange with I-581 and US 220; US 220 Alternate has its southern terminus at the interchange. The other three highways continue west as a four-lane undivided street that passes along the southern edge of the Washington Park neighborhood. At 20th Street, the three highways veer southwest on Salem Turnpike, then west again on Melrose Avenue. The highways expand to a divided highway shortly before SR 116 leaves US 460 and US 11 Alternate by turning north onto two-lane Lafayette Boulevard. At the northern end of Lafayette Boulevard, the state highway heads northwest on Cove Road. SR 116 reaches its northern terminus at an oblique intersection with SR 101 (Hershberger Road).

Founded in 1957 by the O‚ÄôReilly family, the company operates more than 5,400 stores in 47 states, and 20+ stores in Mexico. History Ypsilanti, Michigan O'Reilly Auto Parts in Houston, Texas O‚ÄôReilly Automotive, Inc. officially started in the auto parts business with one store in Springfield, Missouri, in December 1957. Michael Byrne O‚ÄôReilly immigrated to America in 1849, settling in St. Louis, he worked his way through school to earn a law degree, and then pursued a career as a title examiner. His son, Charles Francis O‚ÄôReilly, attended college in St. Louis and went to work in 1914 as a traveling salesman for Fred Campbell Auto Supply in St. Louis. By 1924, Charles had become familiar with the Springfield area, having traveled by train to sell auto parts throughout the territory. By 1932, he had become manager of Link Motor Supply in Springfield, and one of his sons, Charles H. (Chub) O‚ÄôReilly, joined the company. Together they provided the leadership and management that made Link the predominant auto parts store in the area. In 1957, Link planned a reorganization, which would have included the retirement of 72-year-old Charles F. O‚ÄôReilly, and the transfer of Chub O‚ÄôReilly to Kansas City. Since neither agreed with these plans, they made the decision to form their own company, O‚ÄôReilly Automotive, Inc. They opened for business on December 2, 1957, with one store and 13 employees at 403 Sherman in Springfield. Their sales totaled $700,000 in 1958, their first full year of business. By 1961, the company‚Äôs volume had reached $1.3 million ‚Äî the combined volume of O‚ÄôReilly Automotive and Ozark Automotive Distributors, a division formed to serve independent automotive jobbers in the area. In March 1975, annual sales volume rose to $7 million and a 52,000 square-foot facility at 233 S. Patterson was built for the O‚ÄôReilly/Ozark warehouse operation. By that time, the company had nine stores, all located in southwest Missouri. Expansion On April 23, 1993, the company completed an initial public offering, and it now trades on the NASDAQ market under the symbol ORLY. The company also has a stock purchase plan to enable as many full-time team members as possible to own stock in the company. On January 30, 1998, O'Reilly merged with Hi/LO Auto Supply, adding 182 auto parts stores in Texas and Louisiana, as well as a distribution center in Houston.Elder, Laura (December 28, 1997) Rejecting Discount, Hi-Lo finds new buyer for its retail operation Houston Business Journal The Hi/LO acquisition made O‚ÄôReilly one of the top 10 auto parts chains in the country.

The book won the 1999 Miles Franklin Award and the 1999 Commonwealth Writers' Prize. Plot introduction Eucalyptus tells the story of Ellen Holland, a young woman whose \\"speckled beauty\\" and unattainability become legend far beyond the rural western New South Wales town near the property where she grows up. Her protective father's obsession with collecting rare species of Eucalyptus trees leads him to propose a contest - the man who can correctly name all the species on his property shall win her hand in marriage. Thematic concerns The novel contrasts a detailed, scientific classifying of Eucalyptus trees, with the story of Ellen told from a parodied fairy tale perspective. This fits well with Bail‚Äôs status as a writer of fiction and non-fiction. The novel begins with a discussion of Australian culture ‚Äúthe poetic virtues which have their origins in the bush of being belted about by droughts, bushfires, smelly sheep and so on; and lets not forget the isolation, the exhausted shapeless women, the crude language, the always wide horizon, and the flies.‚Äù But concludes that: ‚Äúit really doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù This sets a major theme for the novel to explore. The novel could easily be interpreted as a renegotiation of Australian identity. Bail at once glorifies Australian tradition and attacks the notion of ‚Äúa sun burnt country‚Äù. Ellen‚Äôs story begins with ‚ÄúOnce upon a time.‚Äù This fairy tale beginning is furthered by markedly one-dimensional characters. Ellen‚Äôs beauty is renowned across states and oceans, yet apart from this the reader is given little else to go by. Likewise Holland, Ellen's father, a man who likes to plant trees. Mr. Cave is a brilliant, albeit boring, older man. Likewise the unnamed lover is a storyteller. These flat characters contrast against the scientifically intricate details of the Eucalypt trees. Each short story accelerates the narrative frame and is analyzed within the scientific eucalypt theme. This contrast is well implemented, maintaining flow and cohesion in spite of the fragmented medium. The reader is encouraged to guess ahead at what the story may contain. ‚ÄúThere once was a man on a property outside a one horse town, who couldn‚Äôt come to a decision about his daughter. He then made an unexpected decision. Incredible. For a while people talked of little else‚Äù. This encourages a responder to expect a feminist reading where his daughter is empowered. Not so, instead, he designs a test in which a potential suitor must identify every eucalypt growing on his property. Ellen remains disenchanted with the whole scheme, as countless suitors try and fail at this test. This is until Mr. Cave, a botanical genius arrives. Cave appears to be the only man on earth capable of success. Tragically enough just as Cave nears his goal, Ellen finds her own love elsewhere. Proposed adaptations Film A film version of Eucalyptus was once in the works and was highly publicised in the media, set to star Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe.Jocelyn Moorhouse - News The film, whose budget was estimated sometimes at $15 million and sometimes at $25 million, was reportedly shut down by production company Fox Searchlight because of disputes between actor Russell Crowe and director Jocelyn Moorhouse. Talks began in early 2004; the production was originally intended to star Geoffrey Rush, Bryce Dallas Howard and Russell Crowe, to be directed by Jocelyn Moorhouse, written by her and Michelle Joyner and produced by Uberto Pasolini and Lynda House. Bryce Dallas Howard was reportedly dropped from the project because Russell Crowe reportedly didn't want to act with someone outside his home-country, and Kidman subsequently joined.Nicole Kidman - News In early February 2005, Fox Searchlight announced that the film had been postponed to allow time for further work on the script. It was reported that the director had left the project because of dispute with Russell Crowe. After rumours he would direct the project himself, he cited he would like either Driving Miss Daisy director Bruce Beresford or Last Orders creator Fred Schepisi to helm the project. The project's current status is unknown, but it is thought to have been dropped entirely.

Biography Born in Sandomierz, he was the son of priest Jakub of Collegiate Chapter, and was adopted into the nobility (szlachta). Confidant to W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jagie≈Ç≈Ço He was one of the advisors of king of Poland, Jogaila (W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço), becoming his confessor in 1386 and accompanying him during the baptism of Lithuania in 1387 . At court he held the titles of Royal Notary from 1390 and Deputy Chancellor of the Crown from 1403 to 1412. In 1391 with the help of queen Jadwiga of Poland he was allowed by Pope Boniface IX to undertake higher Holy Orders. He was known for his opposition to the Teutonic Knights, and become trusted advisor of the king who often would discuss his plans only with him and his cousin Vytautas the Great. TrƒÖba accompanied the king into many battlefields, including the Battle of Grunwald in 1410 (Turnbull 2003), where he was one of his chief clercs and officials. Because of Jagie≈Ç≈Ço's support, he became the bishop of Halicz from 1410 to 1412, and later an archbishop of Gniezno from 1412 onwards. Council of Constance As the leader of the Polish delegation to the Council of Constance (1414‚Äì1418) (along with Andrzej ≈Åaskarz, Jakub z Korzkwi Kurdwanowski, Pawe≈Ç W≈Çodkowic and Zawisza Czarny), he was part of the larger German delegation (Kloczowski 2000, ≈ªurek 2005). After they arrived in Konstanz in 1415, TrƒÖba was, according to Ioannes Longinus, briefly considered as one of the candidates for papacy, although historians still debate the reliability of this information (Wyci≈õlak 2004, ≈ªurek 2005). Certainly TrƒÖba temporarily abandoned his support for the Polish cause, supporting pro- Teutonic candidate Oddone Colonna, the future Pope Martin V against pro- Jagie≈Ç≈Ço Antipope John XXIII (Wyci≈õlak 2004; ≈ªurek 2005). This would later cause him problems in Poland, as well as his lack of criticism of the sentence on Jan Hus, which caused further questions about his loyalties in Poland and Bohemia, especially when contrasted with strong defence of Hus by W≈Çodkowic (Wyci≈õlak 2004). He also strongly criticized the marriage of king Jagie≈Ç≈Ço to 45-year-old Elisabeth of Pilica and criticized his rival, the Archbishop of Lw√≥w, Jan of Rzesz√≥w, who remained in Poland (Wyci≈õlak 2004). Some speculate that his stance was motivated by a desire to become pope, and that he hoped that after his election he would be able to reverse all the damage he had caused (Wyci≈õlak 2004); others, that he put the elimination of the Western Schism over the good of his country . In 1418 Pope Martin V was elected to that office, and quickly annulled Antipope John XXIII's papal bulls supporting Poland against the Teutonic Knights. Miko≈Çaj and other members of the Polish delegation felt betrayed and demanded reparations, at one point forcing an entry into a papal audience. Eventually Martin condemned some of the more vocal and \\"anti-Polish\\" declarations of the Teutonic Knights, particularly that of Johannes Falkenberg. He offered TrƒÖba the title of cardinal as a consolation, however Miko≈Çaj refused, not willing to become a such close servant of the new Pope, accepting in exchange the honorary title of primate of Poland (Primas Regni); since then, all archbishops of Gniezno were also primates of Poland, which elevated them above the archbishops of Lw√≥w (Wyci≈õlak 2004). In Poland, the title of primate gained much importance, as the primate presided over local synods, crowned kings and even ruled if no king was present (as an interrex).(Kloczowski 2000) Further controversy Upon his return to Poland, TrƒÖba was faced with many challenges, among them the accusation of treason, especially from the angry nobility (szlachta) eventually, he succeeded in clearing his name; ironically, he was defended by his rival, whom he had criticized at Konstanz, Archbishop Jan of Rzesz√≥w (Wyci≈õlak 2004). Legacy He ordered the creation of the manuscript Cronica conflictus Wladislai regis Poloniae cum cruciferis, Anno Christi 1410, and promulgated the Statutes of TrƒÖba in 1420. The statutes became an important body of legal precepts lasting for many centuries (Kloczowski 2000). While on a diplomatic mission to Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, he died on July 2, 1422, in Hungary; his body was brought back to Gniezno by the knight, Jan of Tuliszk√≥w. TrƒÖba is buried in Gniezno Cathedral. On April 22, 2017, the postcard Cp 1772 \\"600th anniversary of the Primate in Poland\\" was issued by Poczta Polska, which in the illustrative part shows Archbishop Miko≈Çaj TrƒÖb, according to a graphic from the catalog of Jan D≈Çugosz, from the collection of the National Library in Warsawhttps://www.kzp.pl/index.php?artykul=nws-n47-n4773 References *Jerzy Kloczowski, A History of Polish Christianity, Cambridge University Press, 2000, , Google Print, p.65 *Stephen Turnbull, Tannenberg 1410, Osprey Publishing, 2003, 1841765619, Google Print, p.48 * Jacek ≈ªurek, * Pierwszy prymas ‚Äì biography * Jan Lucjan Wyci≈õlak, Pierwszy Prymas ‚Äì article External links * Virtual tour Gniezno Cathedral List of Primates of Poland Category:1358 births Category:1422 deaths Category:People from Sandomierz Category:Archbishops of Gniezno Category:Archbishops of Lviv Category:15th- century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:People in the Battle of Grunwald Category:Clan of TrƒÖby Category:Medieval Polish nobility Category:15th-century Polish people ","title":"Miko≈Çaj TrƒÖba"},{"id":"7173157","text":"Be Human is a 1936 Fleischer Studios animated short film starring Betty Boop and Grampy.

History When it was designated in 1923 along existing state highways, SR 38 traveled from Ripley on the Ohio River to Marion. This route included its current segment between Washington Court House and Marysville, but also served Russellville and Hillsboro. In 1927, the segment of SR 38 north of Marysville was deleted and renumbered by a relocated SR 4. The route would reach its long-time routing between Washington Court House and Marysville in 1932 when US 62 was brought into Ohio replacing SR 38 between Ripley and Washington Court House.

History The band, originally called the Lost Sea Dreamers (Vanguard Records insisted on a name change, as the initials \\"LSD\\" were considered too linked to the drug culture), was formed in 1967 by Bob Bruno and Jerry Jeff Walker. Bruno's song \\"Wind\\", from their self-titled first album, became a minor hit in the United States, particularly through airplay on \\"progressive\\" FM radio stations. This track was a great favorite on Boston radio including Dick Summer's seminal \\"Night Light\\" program on WBZ-AM, and also on WNEW-FM in New York, where pioneering DJ Rosko put \\"Wind\\" on his eclectic playlist. In late December 1967, they performed in an unusual pair of \\"Electric Christmas\\" concerts together with the New York Pro Musica, an ensemble devoted to performing early music. There were two 80-minute performances . The material performed included a reworking of 14th-century composer Guillaume de Machaut's \\"La douce dame jolie\\" as an English-language song \\"Sweet Lovely Lady\\" which was arranged by Robert M.Bruno for the ensemble and a Bruno original \\"Chess Game\\" that, unbeknownst to Bruno himself but noted by John White, director of the Pro Musica, strongly echoed the \\"Romanesca\\", a piece first written down in 16th- century Spanish lute books.Hughes 1967, Strongin 1967, Schonberg 1967. The concert was not a critical success. Donal Henahan, writing in The New York Times, said that it \\"fell somewhat short of being the total-environmental trip that was promised‚Ä¶ the night summed up most of the esthetic ideas now in the air: incongruity, simultaneity, games theory, the put-on, the parody, the Trip‚Ä¶ and the effort to create a 'Total Environment' in which all the senses can come into play.\\" Henahan asserted that the concert's commercial success showed a breakdown in the separation of classical and popular audiences.Henehan 1967. Bruno's interest in jazz apparently diverged from Walker's interest in folk music, and by July 1968 the band had broken up and Walker was appearing at the Bitter End in Greenwich Village, sharing a bill with Joni Mitchell.Shelton July 1968. Bassist Gary White went on to write Linda Ronstadt's first solo hit, \\"Long, Long Time.\\" By 1972 Bruno was appearing with Noah Howard's groups which included several appearances at the NY Free Jazz Festival. He is on the recording called \\"Noah Howard Live at the Village Vanguard\\" with Noah Howard, Franke Lowe, Earl freeman, Juma Sultan, and Rashid Ali (Freedom records and re-released on Iron Man in 2004 as a CD).

The lake has a surface area of approximately and is particularly notable for its scenery, including the colorful lotus flowers that bloom on its surface. It is located about east of the county seat. The people who live in the vicinity of the lake are largely of the Yi ethnic group. As of the spring of 2013 a severe drought had resulted in substantial lowering of the water level. The lake is one of the most- visited destinations in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. It used to be called Yulong Lake, an allusion to the Yulong Mountain that lies to the lake's south. The change of name has mythological reasons. It is believed that in 1629, the dragon believed to live in the lake ascended to heaven in broad daylight, prompting the change in the lake's name. Not much is known about how the lake formed. Records tell that the lake formed during the Qin and Han dynasties. The lake is situated at an elevation of 1414 meters above sea level. It is 15 kilometers long, east to west. It is 3 kilometers wide. The lake's holds 220 million cubic meters of water. Its average depth is 4 meters. Fauna Yilong Lake used to host the endemic fish Anabarilius macrolepis and Cyprinus yilongensis. However, the lake dried up in 1981 for 20 days as a consequence of water extraction, and they have not been seen ever since; they are now considered extinct. The shrimp Caridina yilong is also endemic to Yilong Lake and considered critically endangered, possibly extinct, because of declining lake level and pollution. Surrounding geography To the north and the south of Yulong Lake are majestic peaks, whereas the eastern and the western coasts are bound by flat and fertile land. This combination of scenic landscape and rich agricultural lands is synonymous with southern Yunnan. There are three islands in the lake: Da Rui Cheng, Xiao Rui Cheng, and Ma Ban Long. The southern shore of the last of these islands is riddled with bays, totaling, according to some accounts, an amazing 72 bays. These bays further enhance the beauty and diversity of the lake. There are several bays within the larger bays. These small bays include Da Bay, Gao Jia Bay, Yang Jia Bay, Dou Di Bay and five other bays. The islands and hills surrounding the lake contain fascinating structures like the Lai He Pavilion, Huan Wen Tower, Luo Se Temple, Hui Lan Cabinet, Udakacandra Temple, Guang Yin Temple and several other buildings dating back to the Qing and Ming dynasties.

The Ogden was announced in 2004 as the Streamline Tower condominium project, to be built on the former property of the Golden Inn motel, which was demolished at the end of the year. Work on the property began in 2005, to prepare it for the new project, which began construction the following year. The project was financed by Corus Bank, and was developed by a half-dozen investors, including Las Vegas Stars baseball player Dusty Allen. The tower was topped off in May 2007, and was opened on May 1, 2008. After its opening, Streamline Tower suffered poor sales as the result of a weak local and national economy. That year, 48 buyers who had yet to close escrow on their units filed a federal lawsuit against Streamline Tower in an attempt to retrieve their deposit money, after alleging that their units were smaller than expected and that they had been falsely promised the ability to make profits by renting out their units like hotel rooms. In 2009, Corus Bank foreclosed on the property, which was subsequently acquired by ST Residential later that year after the failure of Corus Bank. In 2010, the tower's units were leased to renters. In January 2011, the property was renamed The Ogden, after Ogden Avenue, one of the streets that the building faces. DK Las Vegas purchased the building in 2013, and began renovating and selling the units the following year, as the units' leases ended. History In July 2004, Vegas Valley Properties (doing business as Streamline Tower LLC) purchased the Golden Inn motel in downtown Las Vegas, located at the southeast corner of North Las Vegas Boulevard and Ogden Avenue, across from the Neonopolis mall. In September 2004, the company submitted plans to the city for a 267-foot condominium tower with 251 units and of commercial space, later reduced to . The project was being planned by a group of investors led by Patrick McCourt of Barclays North, and Dusty Allen, a former baseball player for the Las Vegas Stars. Allen was among a half-dozen investors in the project. Kevin Kelly was also a partner in the project through Vegas Valley Properties. Demolition of the Golden Inn motel began on November 30, 2004, to make room for the Streamline Tower, a 21-story, 251-unit condominium tower that was expected to cost $105 million. Occupancy of the new building was expected around December 2006. Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman attended a publicity event held on the property, which included him kicking off the demolition of the motel with the swing of a sledgehammer. The new project would be located in the center of Goodman's planned entertainment district, as part of a revitalization of the downtown area. Sales began on December 3, 2004. Martin-Harris Construction, the general contractor, had cleared the site by January 2005, and was preparing to begin construction soon. By May 2005, PGAL had been chosen as the project's architect. A nearby sales office at 425 Fremont Street opened on August 12, 2005, at which point Martin-Harris had begun work on the property for the tower. Approximately $3 million was saved on concrete and steel as a result of the developers locking in prices before Hurricane Katrina. Martin-Harris spent six months preparing the site at a cost of $2 million, which included the removal of asbestos. Martin-Harris was constructing the project's infrastructure in March 2006, while a building permit was purchased for nearly $1 million. By that point, Corus Bank had agreed to provide financing for the project. The 21-story Streamline Tower was topped off in May 2007, and was scheduled for occupancy in January 2008. At the time, Allen planned to include a restaurant with live music, and was in discussions with a local celebrity chef. A six-story parking garage with 428 parking spaces was also under construction for the new property. To increase sales, a promotion was held later that summer in which five buyers received free BMW convertible vehicles, worth $37,000 each. The opening was later scheduled to occur in February 2008. However, building inspections began that month instead. Allen hoped to obtain a temporary certificate of occupancy the following month which would allow buyers to close escrow on their units. The project was built at a cost of either $125 million or $205 million. Opening and operation Streamline Tower ultimately opened on May 1, 2008, with 275 units. The opening had been delayed because of difficulty obtaining a certificate of occupancy. Prices for units ranged from $469,000 to $1.35 million. Because of the poor local and national economy, only 156 of its units 57 percent had been sold, which was the lowest percentage of sales among five major condominium projects in the downtown area. Each of the property's street-level retail spaces also remained vacant after opening. In October 2008, 48 buyers who had yet to close escrow on their units filed a federal lawsuit against the property, alleging that their units were smaller than expected and that the property had falsely promised buyers the ability to make profits by renting out their units like hotel rooms. The lawsuit sought the return of each buyer's deposit money. Streamline denied wrongdoing, stating that the claims \\"are completely refuted by the clear and unambiguous terms\\" of the purchase agreements. Susan Allen, the sales director for Streamline Tower and the wife of Dusty Allen, stated that sales agents were not supposed to guarantee the leasing of units. Allen also stated that no promises of leasing units had been made during the previous 15 months that she had worked for the project. The plaintiffs also had concerns about the retail spaces on the property, which were still vacant. Streamline Tower in 2008 In November 2008, the property was appraised at $60.3 million, significantly less than the amount loaned by Corus: $104 million. Streamline Tower LLC and other companies related to the project filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2009, halting any further action in the lawsuit. Corus subsequently received permission to foreclose on the property, and was owed $108 million by Streamline Tower LLC. In June 2009, approximately 40 buyers filed a lawsuit to retrieve their deposit money. By August 2009, Corus had begun seeking buyers for the Streamline Tower property, with at least two potential buyers interested, including The Molasky Group. At that time, the appraised value of the property was $30 million to $35 million, and the building remained operational. After the failure of Corus Bank in September 2009, ST Residential, a division of Starwood Hotel Group, acquired the Streamline Tower out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy later that year. In 2010, the building's condominium units were leased, with prices starting at $1,000 per month. The rental concept was to continue for two years, and the company would then evaluate its success and whether to end leasing and sell the units as condominiums. Touch-up work was performed on the building, and included new exterior paint. In January 2011, the building was renamed as The Ogden, after one of the streets it faces. The Ogden in 2014 Tony Hsieh, the chief executive officer of Zappos, had become a resident in the tower as of 2013. Hsieh also leased dozens of other units for employees of Zappos and for entrepreneurs through his Downtown Project. In January 2013, a small bar with a showroom was being planned for a portion of The Ogden's vacant retail space. Private equity firm DK Las Vegas, a partnership of California's KRE Capital and New York's Dune Real Estate Partners, purchased 248 units in the building in December 2013. DK Las Vegas began selling the units as condominiums in October 2014. In March 2015, the company was spending a $2 million budget on upgrades to the units, 40 of which had already been sold. Up to that point, $1.5 million had already been spent, including a $100,000 lobby renovation, a $100,000 improvement of the building's rooftop sky deck, and a $36,500 revamping of the entrance to add new lighting. Other improvements on the rooftop included a desert landscape theme. Condominium improvements included hardwood floors, granite countertops, green building features, and new lighting. A lounge and outdoor pool were also renovated, as well as all the elevator lobbies. An average of 15 units became available each month in 2015 as rental agreements continued to expire. An Asian restaurant and bar, Itsy Bitsy Ramen and Whisky, opened inside the Ogden in April 2015.

A member of the Mujibnagar Government, Kamaruzzaman was murdered along with Syed Nazrul Islam, Muhammad Mansur Ali and Tajuddin Ahmed in the jail killings in Dhaka Central Jail on 3 November 1975.  Early life  Qamaruzzaman was born in 1926 in the city of Rajshahi in the province of Bengal (now in Bangladesh). He obtained degrees in economics from the University of Calcutta in 1946, and a law degree from the Rajshahi University in 1956.

Political career  Kamaruzzaman joined the Awami League in 1956. He was elected to the National Assembly of Pakistan in 1962, 1965 and again in 1970. He rose to national party leadership posts in the late 1960s, becoming a close ally of Mujib.

The tornado was one in a series of tornadoes that hit Southeast Minnesota on that day, causing at least 37 deaths and over 200 injuries, and it was the impetus for the creation of the Mayo Clinic. On July 21, two other tornadoes struck the area. An F4 tornado was one of a family of tornadoes that killed 4 people near Dodge Center (15 miles west of Rochester), and an F2 tornado devastated Elgin, northeast of Rochester. The outbreak Path of the F5 tornado in Rochester, Minnesota According to Joseph Leonard as written in History of Olmsted County, Minnesota, Although meteorology in 1883 was primitive compared with modern science, Leonard's observations reveal quite a bit about the atmospheric conditions in Rochester that day. High temperatures, high humidity, strong surface winds, and vertical wind shear appear to have all been present, and all are key factors in the development of thunderstorms and tornadoes. The Rochester tornado was one of at least 3 violent tornadoes that hit southeastern Minnesota that day, but because the Rochester twister was so devastating, the other two were largely ignored by the press and relatively little is known about them. * The first tornado touched down at 3:30 PM just south of Rochester near Pleasant Grove. This tornado was approximated at an F3, and it killed 2 people and injured 10. * The second tornado was the large F5 that made a direct hit on Rochester. It touched down at 5:30 PM near Hayfield, traveling before lifting back up after it hit Rochester. It killed 37 and injured over 200, mostly in Rochester. Forty farms were hit and at least 10 were leveled, some with homes swept away. A metal railroad trestle was completely destroyed, and a wooden plank was driven through the trunk of a tree. The northern third of Rochester (a residential area known as North Rochester or Lowertown) was devastated, with 135 homes destroyed and 200 damaged. * The third tornado, approximated at an F3, touched down at 8:30 PM just to the east of Rochester near St. Charles. It killed 1 person and injured 19. Impact The city of Rochester did not have a place to treat the injured from this tornado, as there were only 3 hospitals in the state of Minnesota outside of the Twin Cities at that time; none were near Rochester. After the tornado struck, the meeting room in a commercial building downtown (known as Rommel Hall) was transformed into a temporary hospital. One of the businesses on the main floor of Rommel Hall was Johnson's Funeral Parlor, which like all undertakers in Rochester was called into duty as a temporary morgue. Doctors William Mayo and his two sons, William and Charles, took charge of caring for the patients. Mother Mary Alfred Moes of the Sisters of St. Francis helped care for the patients as well. After this disaster, the Mayo family and the Sisters of St. Francis realized the need of a hospital in Rochester. They banded together to form St. Mary's Hospital, which ultimately led to the creation of the Mayo Clinic and the Tornado Guild, a group dedicated to protecting all Minnesotans from the ravages of the swirling winds.

The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001-05. URL accessed 2006-09-27. Of his works, only a small fragment has been preserved, under the title of Introduction to Music (). Works The work of Alypius consists wholly, with the exception of a short introduction, of lists of the symbols used (both for voice and instrument) to denote all the sounds in the forty-five scales produced by taking each of the fifteen modes in the three genera (diatonic, chromatic, enharmonic). It treats, therefore, in fact, of only one (the fifth, namely) of the seven branches into which the subject is, as usual, divided in the introduction; and may possibly be merely a fragment of a larger work. It would have been most valuable if any considerable number of examples had been left us if the actual use of the system of notation described in it; unfortunately very few remain,Charles Burney, History of Music, vol. i. p. 83 and they seem to belong to an earlier stage of the science. However, Alypius's work remains the best source of modern knowledge of the musical notes of the Greeks, including a comprehensive account of the Greek system of scales, transpositions, and musical notation, and serves to throw some light on the obscure history of the modes.Philipp August B√∂ckh, De Metris Pindari c. 8. p. 235, c. 9. 12 The text, which seemed hopelessly corrupt to its first contemporary editor, classical scholar Johannes Meursius, was nevertheless restored, apparently with success, by the Danish scholar Marcus Meibomius.Antiquae Musicae Auctores Septem, ed. Marc. Meibomius, Amstel. 1652Aristoxenus, Nicomachus, Alypius, ed. Joh. Meursius, Lugd. Bat. 1616. Introduction to Music was printed with the tables of notation in Meibomius' Antiquae Musicae Scriptores, (in quarto, Amsterdam 1652).

Karl von Jan published an authoritative edition in Musici Scriptores Graeci, 1895-1899. Identity There are no tolerably sure grounds for identifying Alypius with any one of the various persons who bore the name in the times of the later emperors, and of whose history anything is known. Jean-Benjamin de la Borde places him towards the end of the 4th century.Jean-Benjamin de la Borde, Essai sur la Musique, iii. 133 According to the most plausible conjecture, he was that Alypius whom the writer Eunapius, in his Life of Iamblichus, celebrates for his acute intellect () and diminutive stature, and who, being a friend of Iamblichus, probably flourished under the emperor Julian the Apostate and his immediate successors, that is, during the 4th century.Eunapius, Life of Iamblichus and not. vol. ii. p. 63, ed. Wyttenbach This Alypius was a native of Alexandria, and died there at an advanced age, and therefore can hardly have been the person whom the Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus called \\"Alypius Antiochensis\\", who was employed by the emperor Julian in his attempt to rebuild the Jewish temple.Ammianus Marcellinus, xxiii. 1. ¬ß 2 Julian addresses two epistles (29 and 30) to Alypius (), in one of which he thanks him for a geographical treatise or chart;Julian the Apostate, Epistulae xxix. xxx. and not. p. 297, ed. Heyler it would seem more likely that this was Alypius of Antioch, instead of the Alypius from Alexandria, although Meursius supposes the two were the same.Meursius, Not. ad Alyp. p. 186, &c.; Iamblichus wrote a life of the Alexandrian Alypius, although it is no longer extant.

In the episode, Ryan Howard (B. J.

Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) steals Karen Filippelli's (Rashida Jones) chair and foils her attempts to get it back. Written by B. J. Novak and directed by Randall Einhorn, the episode first aired in the United States on October 19, 2006 on NBC. Upon its debut, \\"Initiation\\" was seen by an estimated 8.46 million viewers according to Nielsen Media Research. It was positively received by television critics. Synopsis Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) plans to go to his first sales call with Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson). Dwight surprises Ryan by taking him to Dwight's beet farm to both teach and haze. When Ryan, a member of a fraternity in college, accuses him of trying to haze him into acceptance, Dwight snaps at him, saying the reason Ryan has yet to make a sale is because he thinks he knows everything, and must think otherwise to sell. After Dwight tries to force Ryan to wrestle his cousin Mose (Michael Schur), Ryan gets angry and walks out. Dwight apologizes to Ryan and begins to give Ryan serious sales advice as Ryan takes notes. The two then go on a sales call which ultimately doesn't work out for Ryan. Irritated, Ryan throws eggs at the building housing the company that refused his sale. Dwight and Ryan then go to a bar and return to the office, where it appears they formed a new bond. Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) instructs receptionist Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) to keep a log of Michael Scott's (Steve Carell) activity, and throughout the day, she dryly notes Michael's antics, including a Bill Cosby impression for a potential customer and waiting in line with Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) for a free soft pretzel, while hinting to Michael that he should focus on being productive. Michael enjoys Gary Glitter's \\"Rock and Roll\\" in his office at a high volume. After consuming his sugary pretzel, Michael emerges from his office and launches into a hyperactive, sugar-fueled speech before falling asleep at his desk. At the end of the day, Pam realizes that Michael's antics secured a large sale. At Dunder Mifflin's Stamford branch, Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones) discovers that Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) swapped his chair for hers, but Jim foils her efforts to switch them back. The two flirt for a while before Karen steals Andy Bernard's (Ed Helms) chair. Later that night, Jim, who was trying to call Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner), ends up talking to Pam on the phone for the first time since the two kissed. The two have a lengthy conversation and begin to reconnect. Jim misinterprets Pam's parting phrase to Ryan as being directed at him, and the two end their conversation, much to their sadness. The episode ends with a brief talking head of Stanley, counting down the days left in the year until the next Pretzel day. Production This episode was the first full episode of the series directed by Randall Einhorn, and also the first time Einhorn had ever directed any episode of a TV show. Einhorn had previously directed all ten webisodes of the spin-off mini-series \\"The Accountants\\". \\"Initiation\\" was written by B. J. Novak, who also acts for the show as Ryan Howard. The episode aired after \\"Grief Counseling\\", but was filmed before it due to the availability of the beet farm location. Although the idea for writer Michael Schur to be Dwight's cousin Mose had been a joke among the writers since the first season, B. J. Novak pitched the idea when writing \\"Initiation\\". In preparation for the episode, Schur grew out his beard for three months. On the days of the shoot, he also wore wool clothes, which was uncomfortable given the high temperatures outside. Mose was based on an actual participant in the UPN reality show Amish in the City. The episode partially filmed on a ranch owned by Disney, and the production was required to have a professional snake wrangler on site due to the potential for rattlesnake visits to the area. The third season DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from the episode, including Jan asking Michael to record his day on a schedule, Ryan being hugged by Michael before leaving for his first sales call, Dwight and Ryan leaving the office, Michael reading his schedule in a talking head scene, Pam encouraging Michael to \\"focus\\" for the day, Ryan reflecting on his life path, and Dwight showing Ryan his family cemetery and making a reference to his Nazi grandfather by calling him \\"a good man...who did some VERY bad things\\". Reception \\"Initiation\\" first aired on October 19, 2006 in the United States on NBC. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was watched by an estimated 8.46 million viewers. This episode was generally well received by critics. Abby West of Entertainment Weekly stated that \\"one of the many things I love about the show is how current it is.

Her plays are considered pioneering works in Asian-American theater.  Biography  Yamauchi (n√©e Nakamura) was born in Westmorland, California. Her mother and father, both Issei, or first-generation Japanese immigrants, were farmers in California's Imperial Valley. Many of her stories and her two plays, And the Soul Shall Dance and The Music Lessons, are set in the same dusty, isolated settings\\".Wong, Shawn. Asian American Literature. New York: HarperCollins, 1996. Her plays and stories examine the hardships that Japanese Americans faced in California's agricultural communities and in the internment camps during the second World War.Tudeau, Lawrence J. Asian American Literature: Reviews and Criticism of Works by American writers of Asian Descent. Farmington Hills: Gale Research. 1999. In 1942, at seventeen, Yamauchi and her family were interned at the Poston, Arizona camp; the title of her play 12-1-A refers to the family's address in the War Relocation Authority camp. While there, she worked on the camp newspaper, the Poston Chronicle, alongside fellow writer Hisaye Yamamoto (with whom Yamauchi would maintain a lifelong friendship).Wakida, Patricia. \\"Wakako Yamauchi,\\" Densho Encyclopedia. Retrieved 6 April 2015. After a year and a half in Poston, Yamauchi resettled outside camp, first in Utah and then in Chicago, where she began to take in interest in theater. In 1948, she married Chester Yamauchi, with whom she had one child before the couple divorced. She returned to the Los Angeles area, where she studied painting at Otis Art Institute (now called Otis College of Art and Design) and continued to write. Her first published story, And the Soul Shall Dance, appeared in Aiiieeeee! An Anthology of Asian- American Writers. Encouraged by East West Players director Mako, she soon after adapted the story into a play. The stage version of And the Soul Shall Dance was first performed at the East West Players in Los Angeles in 1974, and won the 1977 Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award for best new play. It was later produced for public television. Rosebud and Other Stories, a collection of stories she wrote in her seventies and eighties, was edited by Lillian Howan and published by University of Hawai'i Press in 2010. A collection of her plays and stories was published in 1994 under the title Songs My Mother Taught Me: Stories, Plays and Memoir. In 2018, Yamauchi died in Gardena, California at the age of 93. Works Some of Yamauchi's best-known short stories depict the tensions between the aspirations of Issei women and the patriarchal norms of Issei culture. The stories And the Soul Shall Dance and Songs My Mother Taught Me both depict Issei women struggling to fulfill ambitions that contradict traditional gender roles. And the Soul Shall Dance represents one of the most straightforward depictions of an Issei woman's rebellion. By depicting the complex relationships among the female characters, Yamauchi portrays Issei women's resistance and containment.

The show aired from 1993 to 2000 on ABC, part of the network's TGIF lineup for seven seasons. Several of the characters that originated on Boy Meets World later appeared in its sequel, Girl Meets World. The only main characters not to make an appearance on Girl Meets World are Rachel McGuire and Eli Williams.

His best friend is Shawn Hunter, and his mother and father are Amy and Alan Matthews. By the end of the series, he has three siblings: Eric, Morgan, and Joshua. Cory is friends with Topanga Lawrence, his \\"first true love\\", whom, he eventually marries late in the series. Sometimes, Cory does not get along with Topanga, when Cory is not doing the right thing, or not doing things the right way (humorously), complete with deadpan humor and puns. Mr. George Feeny is Cory's teacher/principal, mentor, and neighbour. He goes to him for advice on his problems. Cory always works his problems out. In the last episode, it is revealed that Cory is actually short for 'Cornelius'. He is not fond of this fact, yet he ends up forgetting about it and going on with his life. Cory struggled in high school, where he often had trouble with bullies and has less-than-stellar study habits. Cory's personality changes somewhat as he gets older. For the first few years, he's a slacker and just barely a better student than Shawn. One major difference between Cory and Shawn is that Cory seems to get more worked up or neurotic about random things, whereas Shawn is more laid back. If Cory does not want to do something school-related, he will make a big production about the fact that he does not want to do it, and how unnecessary he finds it; whereas Shawn will just not do it, preferring to fall asleep or make paper airplanes. During the junior and senior years in high school, Cory becomes a hard working student, able to raise his GPA in addition earning an adequate SAT score to get accepted into colleges. As the series progresses, Cory's \\"slacker\\" tendencies diminish, and his neuroses increase, along with his pessimism and paranoia. This leads Cory to occasionally develop an inferiority complex; such as Shawn gets better ideas than him when participating their high school's work study program, meeting art prodigy Alexandra Nechita, and Topanga gets a better job than his after they got married. When Cory and Topanga begin their relationship, many women seem to be attracted to Cory, which Shawn explains as girls being attracted to men who are off the market. In the past, Cory has kissed other women while with Topanga; Lauren (Linda Cardellini), whom Cory develops an affectionate bond with at a ski resort, led to him being suffered indecision between the two women and break up with Topanga for a while until they reconcile, and a college girl almost had sex with him once. By the end of the series, Cory, Topanga, and their friends eventually left Philadelphia for an internship that Topanga got with a law firm in New York City, and by the time of the events of Girl Meets World, Cory has had two children with Topanga, a daughter named Riley plus a son named Auggie. Cory is, at this point in his life, a seventh- grade history teacher and his daughter is also in his class. In this spin-off series, Cory, who is now matured and experienced, plays the similar role as his father Alan and George Feeny had; mentoring his children and their friends about life, while still learning his craft as a young teacher (akin to Jonathan Turner). Mr. Feeny George Feeny (William Daniels) Throughout the series, Feeny tries his best to guide young Cory, Shawn, and their friends as they encounter problems in their lives on their road to adulthood. He first appears on the show as their grade-school teacher. He eventually becomes their high school principal, and lastly college professor (teaching such diverse courses as archaeology, English literature, and quantum physics). Cory mentions more than once that Feeny is the only teacher he has ever had since kindergarten. Later on in the show, Mr. Feeny becomes the mentor and idol of Eric Matthews. Feeny is a Boston native and enjoys gardening. He delivers the final line of Boy Meets World dialogue in the series finale, directed to an empty classroom just vacated by his beloved students: \\"I love you all. Class dismissed.\\" Mr. Feeny was once married to a woman named Lillian, who died before the series began. Although Feeny had dated another teacher named Elizabeth from Boston off-screen for 15 years, a conversation with Eric made him to realize that, despite that he and his romantic partner each believed that they are not married because of their careers; they simply do not love each other. He later marries Dean Lila Bolander (played by William Daniels' real-life wife Bonnie Bartlett; the duo similarly portrayed spouses on St. Elsewhere), whom he finds success after his relationship with Elizabeth and competition with Dean Bolander's ex-husband Dr. Curtis Kincaid (Francis X. McCarthy) for her affection. He makes a brief cameo at the end of the Girl Meets World pilot episode as a figment of Cory's imagination, telling him, \\"Well done, Mr. Matthews\\", and Topanga likens Cory to him in a later episode.In \\"Girl Meets Smackle\\", Topanga defends her insufficient familiarity with all of the life lessons that Cory teaches by explaining that \\"he has so many of them\\". This leads her to gasp, \\"Oh my God; I married Feeny!\\" The character made two appearances in the second season \\"Girl Meets Gravity\\", \\"Girl Meets Pluto\\"., and appeared again in the third and final season, including the series finale. Amy Matthews Amy Matthews (Betsy Randle) is the wife of Alan Matthews and the mother of Eric, Cory, Morgan, and Joshua Matthews. During the earlier years of the show, Amy was a real estate agent and eventually became an art gallery worker toward the end of the show. Amy often plays counterpoint to Alan in giving their children discipline and guidance. In dealing with Eric, she always discourages \\"babying\\" him, whereas several episodes involving Cory see a much more gentle and motherly Amy. Eric Matthews Eric Randall Matthews (Will Friedle) is the elder brother of Cory, Morgan, and Joshua Matthews. He began the show as a suave, popular young man, who constantly went out on dates. He was originally portrayed as the stereotypical elder brother. Eric's character changed mid-series from preppy elder brother to \\"crazy, moronic brother\\". During the fourth season, Eric takes a year off from school when he doesn't get into a college of his choice. Eric often plays off his hero and mentor, Mr. Feeny. Though Eric and Feeny are not originally seen as having a close relationship, the two develop a bond, that‚Äîat least in Eric's mind‚Äîis one of love. It was even implied once that Eric likes to tell people (such as Rachel) that Feeny is his grandfather. This culminates at the end of the fifth season when Eric sings a rousing of \\"To Sir, With Love\\" at Cory's high school graduation. Eric is also the creator of the \\"Feeny call\\", and even makes a talking doll for Feeny to \\"make the call\\", so Feeny will not miss him when he moves to New York with the others. Eric is actually highly intelligent, and Feeny mentions that Eric can get passing grades in his sleep (in fact, he once did). He compares this to Cory who, though lacking Eric's natural intelligence, makes up for it by being hard-working when he wants to be, and thus succeeds. Eric, on the other hand, is too lazy and immature to be anything but a ridiculous \\"goof-off\\", to the annoyance of his family and Mr. Feeny, in addition lacking confidence to his own capability to succeed academically. In Girl Meets World, Cory mentions that Eric is the only person he knows who can do the impossible, and later Jack Hunter asks if he's still an \\"idiot genius\\". During the later years, storylines involving Eric became stranger and wackier, often bending the rules of reality itself, such as an episode where Eric continually tries to sneak up on Topanga by using many disguises and crazy situations. The change from a girl-crazy cool-conscious teenager (the first half of the series) to a scatter-brained odd-ball (the second half of the series) was a drastic change. Eric often provides comic relief in tough situations throughout the series. It is hinted that he is a fan of the raunchy animated comedy South Park, as he has made references to the program, by doing voice impressions of Cartman and other South Park characters on different occasions. On the contrary, Eric has appeared sensitive when it comes to matters of family and friends, as in the episode \\"Brotherly Shove\\", where Eric feels rejected by Cory when he was not asked to help clean out the garage, which was filled with memories from their childhood. Also, in the episodes \\"The War\\" and \\"Seven the Hard Way\\", the audience realizes that Eric finds friendship a serious matter and values it more than anything, apparent in his quote, \\"Lose one friend, lose all friends. Lose yourself.\\" At one point he befriends a young orphaned boy named Tommy and wants to adopt him, but ultimately decides against it, so Tommy can live with a family that can better support him. Upon graduating college in the series finale, Eric decides to get a new lease on life, and in doing so: he moves to New York City with his brother, sister-in law, and Shawn. During the interim between the events of Boy Meets World and the sequel series Girl Meets World, Eric moves upstate, and is elected mayor of [the fictional] St. Upidtown, on the Quebec border. By his own admission, he has no understanding whatsoever of the town's political problems, but the electorate trust him because of his handling of their personal issues. Topanga intentionally mispronounces the municipality's name by disregarding the period and space, thus rendering it \\"Stupidtown\\". Initially, Friedle declined to reprise his role in the sequel series Girl Meets World, but later became a recurring character; Eric made his initial appearance in the season 2 episode \\"Girl Meets Mr. Squirrels\\"; when Cory's daughter Riley and her best friend Maya have a major argument that threatens to destroy their friendship, Eric is called in by Cory to mediate and he successfully reconciles the girls. The episode title is a reference to the Boy Meets World Season 7 episode \\"Seven the Hard Way\\"; and he again administers his \\"Lose one friend‚Ä¶\\" mantra. Early plans for the sequel had Eric's son, Troy, being a prominent part of the cast; the role of the teenage relative is instead filled by Cory and Eric's youngest brother, Joshua (now portrayed by Uriah Shelton). At the end of \\"Girl Meets Mr. Squirrels\\", a TV news anchor reports a major political blunder by Jefferson Davis Graham, a six-term Senator from New York, wrecking his chances of re-election, unless he can find someone even more incompetent to run against him, and the anchor hints at the prospective opponent by showing a picture of Eric (in his guru garb). In the later episode \\"Girl Meets Mr. Squirrels Goes To Washington\\", Eric is chosen to run in the upcoming senatorial election against the incumbent Graham, but when it is revealed that Eric was recruited by Graham's own political advisor in an attempt to get Graham back in good graces with the electorate, Eric is crushed, but Riley and Maya, using a giant bowl of Cocoa Puffs, encourage him to get back in the race. During the televised senatorial debate, the public gets a first-hand opportunity to compare Eric's innate goodness against Graham's incompetence, and Eric goes on to win the election. He gets strong praise and recommendation from a blogger named T.J. who turns to be a now-grown up Tommy. Shawn Hunter Shawn Patrick Hunter (Rider Strong) was born in Ohio and lived in Oklahoma for a while as a child. He had been in five different schools before the age of 12. Shawn has been the best friend of Cory Matthews for nearly their whole lives, since the two met when Cory fell into an animal pen at a zoo and Shawn came to his rescue. Shawn has a personality almost opposite Cory's; Shawn takes more risks and has more of a bad boy image. Their personality differences do cause problems between the two a few times, but these problems never destroy their friendship. Later seasons depict the relationship between Cory and Shawn as being so intimate that it causes Topanga to be jealous, and several innuendos are made referencing the subconscious homoerotic nature of their friendship. In the first season of Boy Meets World, not much is known about Shawn except that he is Cory's best friend. In season two and thereafter, the show begins to focus on Shawn's life as well. In the beginning, Shawn lives with both his parents, Chet and Virna Hunter. One day, Virna runs off with the trailer and Shawn is left under the care of the Matthews family while Chet chases after his wife. When the Matthews find out that Chet will not be returning for a while, Jonathan Turner, a teacher at John Adams High School, offers to take care of Shawn and eventually to become his legal guardian. About a year later, Chet comes back and Virna temporarily rejoins her family before eventually taking off again. Shawn goes through several ups and downs throughout the show, including briefly joining a cult and nearly succumbing to alcoholism, similar to his father. In a later season, Shawn's half-brother Jack arrives in town for college. Shawn moves in with Jack and Eric Matthews, Cory's older brother, leaving Chet free to take off again. However, on a trip back to town, during which Chet attempts to reconcile with Shawn and promises to finally stay, Chet dies of a heart attack. In later seasons, Shawn is able to talk to Chet as a ghost. During the final episodes of the series, Shawn discovers that Virna is not his biological mother when she sends him a letter after Chet's death. Apparently, Chet was left to take care of Shawn after his biological mother, who was actually a stripper, left shortly after his birth. Despite the Matthews family's offer to legally adopt Shawn after he discovers this, Shawn declines, declaring that he still has Jack as family and he still needs to take care of the Hunter clan. Shawn is a ladies' man, a trait which Cory is constantly envious of. However, Shawn is jealous of Cory's close, long-term relationship with Topanga. Later in the series, Shawn falls in love with a girl named Angela. They have a tempestuous relationship, but genuinely care for each other. Angela eventually leaves as well, to travel with her military father. In the episode \\"Fraternity Row\\" it is revealed that during high school Shawn was challenged in writing, but \\"Poetic License: An Ode to Holden Caulfield\\", reveals that during college he has improved significantly and additionally has had a lifelong affinity for poetry. He is also a skilled photographer, and nearly chooses a job at a glamour magazine company over college. At the end of the series, Shawn moves to New York with Cory, Topanga, and Eric. Revealed during Girl Meets World, however, Shawn left New York the day of the birth of Cory and Topanga's daughter Riley, ultimately making a name for himself as a world-traveling writer and photographer. When he returns to the city, he forms a bond with Riley's best friend Maya, sharing a similar childhood upbringing and both coming from broken homes. He also forms a bond with Maya's mother Katy, who shares a similar feeling of abandonment due to her husband and Maya's father's leaving. By the second season, Riley is hopeful that Shawn will become Katy's husband and Maya's father, although Shawn still has unresolved feelings for Angela. Angela returns with news that she has since married a military man, like her now-deceased father, and wants advice on whether she'd be a good mother or not, which she insists can only come from Shawn. Shawn encourages her to be a mother, and Angela encourages Shawn to pursue a relationship with Katy. Shawn and Katy eventually date and get married, and Shawn becomes a father figure to Maya.\\"Girl Meets Hurricane\\" After directing two first-season episodes of Girl Meets World, Rider Strong has become a fixture behind the scenes, while also making appearances in a recurring role. Stuart Minkus Stuart Minkus or simply just Minkus (Lee Norris) was the resident genius and nerd in Cory's sixth grade class. During his time on the show, he was shown as being in love with Topanga, and was often made fun of by Cory and Shawn. Everyone referred to him as simply \\"Minkus\\", except Topanga and Mr. Feeny. Before Topanga's character changes, he was the one constantly obsessed with grades and academic achievements. Minkus was on the show from 1993‚Äì1994, reappearing in the \\"Graduation\\" episode in 1998, with Minkus and Topanga now portrayed as bitter rivals. The reason given for his absence was that his classes were on the other side of the school all along. Despite his brief tenure on Boy Meets World, Stuart appears as a major recurring character in the sequel Girl Meets World, with Norris reprising his role. He makes his first appearance in the episode \\"Girl Meets Maya's Mother\\" where he is revealed to be the doppelganger father of Farkle, one of Riley Matthews' best friends. He brags to Cory and Topanga that he has become a wealthy businessman who owns a helicopter. Despite being a married man, Stuart still longs for Topanga. His wife and Farkle's mother, Jennifer (Kristanna Loken) an ex-girlfriend of Shawn Hunter makes her first appearance in the second season. Jennifer appeared as the main antagonist in two episodes of Boy Meets World. In the updated series she is shown to be a much nicer, doting parent. Morgan Matthews Morgan Matthews (Lily Nicksay; seasons 1-2/Lindsay Ridgeway; recurring season 3, main seasons 4‚Äì7) is the only daughter of Alan and Amy Matthews, the younger sister of Eric and Cory and the older sister of Joshua. She inexplicably disappeared after the show's second season and reappeared midway through the following season played by a different actress. In the episode of her return, a joke is made about her long absence. Upon her reappearance, she says, \\"That was the longest timeout I ever had!\\" With the introduction of a new actress in the role came a shift, not just in age, but also in personality as Morgan went from being the cute and innocent girly girl little sister interested in dolls, pretty dresses and perfume to being a more sassy, rude and sarcastic and more tomboyish character who delights in making fun of her brothers, especially Cory. In the series finale she, along with Amy and Alan, say goodbye to Cory, Eric, Shawn and Topanga when they depart for New York. Both Nicksay and Ridgeway appear as Morgan in the series finale of Girl Meets World. A joke is even made about the two, with Cory and Topanga's son, Auggie being frightened when he is comforted by both. Alan Matthews Alan Matthews (William Russ) is the husband of Amy Matthews, and the father of Eric, Cory, Morgan, and Joshua. Alan, as the father of the Matthews children, provides guidance to his children. He has a quick temper, though when it shows up, usually through consultation with his wife, he often apologizes afterwards for words spoken in anger. In some later episodes, Alan does not support Eric in all of his ventures, and Amy, in turn, tells Alan that his coddling of Eric is the reason Eric has turned out the way he is. Alan was also somewhat of a \\"father figure\\" for Shawn Hunter. He explained to Cory in the first season that he saw a lot of his younger self in Shawn, and encouraged Cory to be there to help Shawn through his tough life. While there were times when he thought that Shawn was too much of a negative influence, such as when Cory and Shawn were arrested for underage drinking, he always cared about Shawn's well-being, even stating in the fourth season that he would \\"kill to protect Shawn from con men like you\\" to a cult leader who was trying to take advantage of Shawn's feelings of isolation. He began his career as the manager of the Market Giant supermarket, eventually winning a prized \\"Grocie\\" Award. Prior his marriage, Alan joined the United States Navy instead of enrolling in college after high school, a decision he is regretting and glad that his children did not made the same choice. In the episode \\"Better Than the Average Cory\\", reveals that after Alan's father's health deteriorated, he took over his job as a janitor for a factory before working at Market Giant. Eventually, he becomes disillusioned with his standard \\"9-5\\" job that he had worked for so many years, and quits without discussing it with his family first. A brief period of family distress follows, with Amy proclaiming that she will, in turn, \\"make a major decision that affects the entire family without consulting with him first\\". Accordingly, she purchases a sporting goods and outdoor supply store that is up for sale, which Alan happily takes over, and renames Matthews & Son. Topanga Lawrence ' (Danielle Fishel) is Cory's main love interest. Her character underwent dramatic changes during the course of the series. When she was initially introduced in the first season, first as a guest character and later recurring, she was a hippie vegetarian and somewhat of an outcast, sitting at the table with the other \\"weird kids\\". Even her name was taken from a hippie hangout, Topanga, California. However, once the characters entered high school (and Danielle Fishel became a main character), she became more of a \\"regular teenage girl\\", and her beliefs about the environment and other topics were less emphasized. Much was now made of the fact that Topanga was the most attractive and the most popular girl at school, and academically successful. She also cut her trademark long hair in an episode in season 4 while trying to show Cory that true beauty is on the inside. She grows distant from her parents, whom she once was very close to; by the fourth season. In A Long Walk To Pittsburgh Part 1, her parents force her to move to Pittsburgh; but in part 2, she runs away from them back to Philadelphia to be with Cory. Her relationship with her parents became further apart after their divorce. Also starting in high school, her on-again/off-again relationship with Cory became one of the major elements of the show. Their relationship seems to mirror traditional high school sweethearts, dealing with normal boyfriend/girlfriend problems; such as Cory suffers indecision between Topanga and another girl named Lauren (Linda Cardellini) which causes them to break up until reuniting in \\"Starry Night\\". The series tries to justify this by saying that Cory and Topanga first met as toddlers and became best friends, only to be driven apart as they grew older and Eric pressured Cory to think of girls as \\"icky\\". By the time of the first-season episodes, Cory has apparently completely forgotten about Topanga and knows almost nothing about her. Although Topanga was accepted to Yale University, she decided to attend Pennbrook College with Cory and their friends. She proposed to Cory at their high school graduation. They married during their sophomore year (during the final season), after which the show attempted to put them in stereotypical marriage problem situations. At the end of the series, she and Cory, along with Eric and Shawn, moved to New York City where Topanga pursued a law internship. Shortly after the Boy Meets World finale, Topanga became pregnant and later gave birth to their first child, a daughter named Riley. Several years later, she had a second child, a son named August \\"Auggie\\" Matthews. In addition to raising the family, Topanga continues her pursuit of a career in law and eventually passes the bar exam. Cory and Topanga's marriage continued in Girl Meets World, by which point Topanga has become a successful attorney and soon the owner of a local Ukrainian bakery, and Riley is thirteen years old. It is strongly implied that Topanga's name is the result of a journal entry by her maternal grandmother, Rosie McGee, concerning a chance encounter with a young artist in 1961.In \\"Girl Meets 1961\\", Rosie McGee (Rowan Blanchard) ventures down to Greenwich Village for the first time. At Caf√© Hey, she unknowingly meets the ancestors of three of her great-granddaughter's classmates (along with an off-camera Bob Dylan and Joan Baez). A mysterious blonde artist (Sabrina Carpenter) tells of her plan to travel to Topanga Canyon, leading Rosie to remark in her diary about what a nice name Topanga is for something one loves. She has, in her own words, a middle name even more embarrassing than \\"Topanga\\". Mr. Turner ' (Anthony Tyler Quinn) was the teacher of Cory, Shawn, and Topanga starting in the second season. His more laidback approach to teaching often clashed with Mr. Feeny's more traditional methods, and the students found that they could more easily identify with the hip, Harley-riding Mr. Turner. In the second season, Shawn found residence with Mr. Turner (when his dad went on a cross- country search for Shawn's mother Verna), and found in him a friend and mentor. Mr. Turner remained on the show until midway through the fourth season, when he was put in the hospital after being involved in an accident. When Chet Hunter got back, Shawn again lives with his father briefly, until Chet had him live with his half-brother, Jack, as his roommate; thus Jack taking over the guardianship for Shawn from Chet. As homage to the character, the show made a reference to him in the last episode of Season 5; when Stuart Minkus returns for a cameo and calls out to an unseen Mr. Turner, indicating that he has recovered from his accident and returned to work. Mr. Turner is also best friends with Eli Williams. Mr. Turner later returns as a recurring character in Girl Meets World beginning with the episode \\"Girl Meets the New Teacher\\" where it is revealed that after his accident he fell in love with his nurse and married her. He has also gone on to become the superintendent of New York's public school system. Cory's daughter, Riley, sees him as an uncle figure as he has formed an even closer affinity with the Matthews family than before, visiting their home often. Though thankful for him being a good educator, Topanga holds a grudge against Turner because he gave her an A- in high school. He made another appearance in the episode \\"Girl Meets Creativity\\". Eli Williams Eli Williams (Alex D√©sert) was another teacher to Cory, Shawn, and Topanga. He joined the show in season three when his best friend and former college roommate Jonathan Turner got him a job at the school, teaching media arts. Like Turner, Williams is considered \\"hip and cool\\", and can relate easily to the young students. However, being a former journalist at a television station in Philadelphia, he sometimes finds teaching and reaching out to students to be a difficult chore, something that Turner helps him out with. Stories in the third season were written to focus on the friendship between Turner and Williams and the single bachelor life of dating, partying, and socializing that they experience outside of their teaching, showing the life of young adults post-college. Williams had a starring role throughout the third season, and is last seen in the episode \\"Brother, Brother\\". Although he is never mentioned again after season three, he is featured in flashbacks via archive footage in the series finale \\"Brave New World\\", and as a result, Alex D√©sert (who by this time was co-starring on Becker) is credited as a special guest star despite never making an actual appearance. In the DVD commentaries, Michael Jacobs and some of the actors discuss the network pressure during seasons 2 and 3 to bring more young adult characters to the cast. Eli Williams strongly reflects this trend. Despite Michael Jacobs' intention to include every Boy Meets World cast member on Girl Meets World, Eli Williams never made an appearance. Jack Hunter Jack Hunter (Matthew Lawrence) is Shawn's paternal half-brother, and very different from him. Growing up in a wealthy stepfamily at New York City, Jack has money, works out, and has experienced relatively little difficulty in his life. Besides Shawn, Jack has at least one maternal half-sister at home. Jack's mother left Chet Hunter with her son due to not being able to cope with her former husband's alcoholism, and eventually she and Chet both remarried after their divorce. Shawn learned about Jack's existence from his father when he was seven years old; he happily wrote to his half-brother in hopes of getting acquainted as brothers. Jack's mother, however, hid Shawn's letters from her son, leaving Shawn to believe that his half-brother turned his back on his paternal family with his mother for years until Jack finds out. Despite of it, Jack and Shawn did meet before the former enrolled to Pennbrook College at some point, but they weren't yet aware of Jack's mother's deception at the time. Despite Jack resenting his father for his past alcoholism, he also wants to have relationships with him and Shawn, which leads him to choose Pennbrook in hopes of becoming close to them. Dialogues imply that though Jack has a good relationship with his stepfather, but never as close as Jack would like with his father. Jack's aversion to his family's alcoholism makes him vow never to drink, and tries to save Shawn from it in one episode. However, despite having been raised by his stepfather, Jack had a gambling problema trait he shares with his father, but falls into brief relapse when placing a school bet. Chet continued to visit his sons at Pennbrook and began to reconcile with them before his death, leaving both Jack and Shawn devastated. Chet had Shawn live with Jack during Shawn's senior year in high school, effectively having Jack taking over the guardianship for Shawn from his father and Jonathan Turner until his half-brother's graduation, though Shawn eventually moved back in with him later. Like Eric and Cory Matthews, Jack and Shawn share a comical and somewhat hostile sibling rivalry which ultimately ends with reconciliation; they have acknowledged each other brothers with Jack entering Shawn's life. Jack became Eric's roommate, and the pair developed a friendship parallel to their siblings'. Jack, along with Eric, pined for Rachel after she moved in with them, eventually winning this battle once Eric realizes he was competing more for the sake of competing, rather than due to any genuine feelings for Rachel. The relationship between Jack and Rachel ultimately doesn't work out. Jack's personality was often adapted to the episodic storyline, rather than having his own distinct character. He once mentions having six percent body fat, though he confides that in high school he was referred to as \\"Jumbo Jack\\", much to Eric's amusement. In the Girl Meets World season two episode \\"Girl Meets Semi-Formal\\", it is revealed that Jack left the Peace Corps and ended his relationship with Rachel. He has joined a corporation looking to buy Eric's vote for a pipeline which would harm the environment. Jack ultimately decides not to go through with the pipeline after Eric reminds him about how simple life was when they were younger, by taking him to a middle school semi-formal dance. Jack happens to meet Cory's daughter Riley at the dance. Angela Moore Angela Moore (Trina McGee-Davis) was the sweetheart of Shawn Hunter in Seasons 5‚Äì7. Her first appearance, uncredited, was in Season 5, and she became a regular cast member later that season but was only billed in the closing credits with a special \\"And Starring\\" credit. Angela is witty and passionate about causes and people. She enjoys things for their artistic value. Although she broke up with Shawn during one or two episodes, and once for a longer period in the show's Pennbrook stage, eventually revealing that, like Shawn, Angela also comes from a broken family as her mother left her and her father. Angela fears that she would hurt Shawn as her mother did to her father. They resolved their issues and became very close, declaring their love for each other. Angela left for Europe with her father to be close to him in the series' second to last episode, therefore she is the only main character absent in the series finale. Angela later returns in the sequel series Girl Meets World in a guest appearance. Prior to her debut, she is mentioned in the program's season one episode \\"Girl Meets Master Plan\\" when Cory and Topanga explain to their daughter Riley, and her friend Maya, how Shawn and Angela met. It's also revealed that Angela and Shawn never spoke again after she left (unwittingly fulfilling her prediction that she would leave Shawn after all). She is similarly referenced in season two's \\"Girl Meets Pluto\\". Angela finally makes an appearance in the episode \\"Girl Meets Hurricane\\" where she not only reveals to Shawn the tragic news that her father Sgt. Maj. Moore (Julius Carry) died in a fishing accident, but she has also gotten married to a man in the military much like her father was. Her reason for meeting up with Shawn is to get some advice and council about her fears of becoming a mother out of fear that she may end up like her own. Shawn encourages Angela to start a family with her husband, and experience the joy of being a parent (subtly implying how he feels about being a father figure for Maya in the process). After this, Angela encourages Shawn to pursue a relationship with Katy ‚Äì Maya's mother ‚Äì and leaves to go back home. Rachel McGuire Rachel Kimberly McGuire (Maitland Ward) is the final addition to the main cast, appearing in the sixth and seventh seasons of the series. Rachel is a very sweet, mature young woman who forms a bond with Jack and Eric almost instantly. She and Jack date for a relatively short period of time, before deciding on being just friends. Still, it's strongly implied that the two harbor feelings for one another. Prior to moving in with Jack and Eric, she lived down the hall with her Texan boyfriend. She also roomed with Topanga and Angela for a few episodes until she got an on-campus job as a resident assistant, allowing Jack, Eric, and Shawn to get the apartment back. Rachel was the focus of a two episode story- arc in season seven when a prank war goes wrong, leaving Rachel (as well as Angela and Jack) feeling like the outcast of the gang. After Eric and Feeny intervene in an effort to save their friendships, the gang realizes the whole thing was petty and make up. In the series finale, she joins the Peace Corps with Jack. Despite Michael Jacobs' intention to include every Boy Meets World cast member on Girl Meets World and Ward's willingness to reprise her role, Rachel never made an appearance. However, she is mentioned in the season 2 episode \\"Girl Meets Semi-Formal\\" in which Matthew Lawrence reprises his role as Jack. Eric reveals that he and Rachel are still close, whereas Jack and Rachel no longer speak. Recurring characters Lauren Lauren (Linda Cardellini), is Cory Matthews' potential love interest and archenemy of Topanga Lawrence during Season 5; Cory meets Lauren when he sprained his ankle getting off a bus for a ski trip. She appeared on two episodes in Season 5 and one episode in Season 6. Cory develops an affectionate bond with Lauren and they had kissed, causing Cory and Topanga to break up for a while. Cory ultimately chooses Topanga after realizing his love for her and ended his potential relationship with Lauren off-screen. Topanga herself also kissed another guy during her separation with Cory, making her realize that sometimes she and Cory need to endure trials in their relationship to prove whether their love for each other is strong; Cory and Topanga ultimately got back together. Despite Cory being happy in his relationship with Topanga, one episode reveals that Cory occasionally thinks about Lauren, and she later appears in Cory's dream in a Season 6 episode (\\"The Psychotic Episode\\") after he and Topanga got engaged, implying that Cory is subconsciously wondering what life could have been like if he had chose Lauren instead. Lauren is later mentioned in the sequel Girl Meets World and it is revealed in the two-part episode \\"Girl Meets Ski Lodge\\" that she too has become a parent. Her teenage son, Evan, appears in the episode as a friendly employee at the Mount Sun Lodge. However, Evan's relation to Lauren isn't shown until the ending moments of the second part where he innocently tells Cory that his mother says hello. Cory freaks out and runs out of the ski lodge, much to Evan's confusion. Chet Hunter Shawn's father, Chet Hunter (Blake Clark), is an on-again, off-again father figure, frequently leaving town for months or even years at a time. He is a jack-of-all-trades, holding a wide variety of (usually low- paying) jobs over the course of the series. Shawn originally idolizes his father and thinks himself responsible for his father's frequent departures. In time, though, he grows angry and resentful at the way his father treats him. Chet's eldest son, Jack, also resents his father for his past alcoholism and subsequent divorce from his mother, but he is looking for an opportunity to reconcile with him, out of hope they can be a family with Shawn. During his first major departure, Chet leaves Shawn in the care of Alan and Amy Matthews, but this ends quickly and Shawn goes to live with Jonathan Turner instead. He moves back in with his father when Chet returns to town, but at Chet's insistence, moves in with his half-brother Jack and Eric Matthews. When Shawn goes to Pennbrook, Chet goes to Jack's stepfather to ask for money to pay for Shawn's tuition. Chet returns to Philadelphia briefly, prompting a conflict with Shawn, who finally loses patience with his father's inability to stay around. Chet tells Shawn he always wanted the best for him, and stayed away because he didn't think he was good enough for him. Chet has a heart attack soon after; while in the hospital he and Shawn begin to take steps toward reconciliation when Chet dies from a second heart attack. Chet appears as a ghost in four episodes, \\"Road Trip\\" in Season 6, as well as \\"Family Trees\\", \\"Brave New World (Part 2 ‚Äì Series Finale)\\" in Season 7, and \\"Girl Meets Hurricane\\" in Girl Meets World‚Äôs Season 2. He acts as a spirit guide for Shawn in the hard times portrayed in the first two episodes, giving him counsel and advice. His appearance in the series finale is a comical one; in a moment played for laughs as he otherwise proudly watches over his sons, Chet is outraged when he hears Jack deciding to give up his wealth for happiness, but is later proud after knowing that he is joining the Peace Corps. Unlike his other ghost appearances, no one can see or hear him in this scene, so Jack is unaware of Chet's reactions. Chet's only appearance in Girl Meets World is in the season 2 episode \\"Girl Meets Hurricane\\"; he encourages Shawn to pursue a romantic relationship with Katy, and implies that Shawn would be a good father-figure for Katy's daughter Maya. Two episodes involving Chet (\\"We'll Have A Good Time Then...\\" and \\"I'm Gonna Be Like You, Dad\\") are named for lines from the Harry Chapin song \\"Cat's in the Cradle\\", which is about a broken father-son relationship. Joshua Matthews Joshua Matthews, (Daniel Jacobs) is the youngest of the Matthews siblings. He is born in the episode \\"My Baby Valentine\\" but only weighs 5 lbs and is very ill. He soon gets better in the episode \\"Resurrection\\". He makes his final appearance in the last episode where Cory gives him a speech about all of things that he has learned over the past seven years. He later returns as a teenager in the sequel series Girl Meets World, this time playing a larger role and being portrayed by Uriah Shelton. Joshua has grown up to be a handsome young man who has a great relationship with Cory and Alan. He also seems to have a charming yet silly personality, akin to Eric. Maya has a small schoolgirls crush on him for a brief episode. In the episode Girl Meets Game Night, Joshua talks to Maya about her crush on him. He says that he is too old for her and asks if she understands that. Maya sadly confirms it but says she will still fight for him. Later though in the episode Girl Meets the Tell Tale Tot, Josh says that she's not so little anymore and that he guesses he should stop looking at her like that. Frankie Stechino Francis Albert \\"Frankie the Enforcer\\" Stechino (Ethan Suplee) is one of Harley Keiner's \\"lackeys\\" at John Adams High, and an eventual close friend of Cory Matthews and Shawn Hunter. Surviving much longer than his counterparts, Harley and Joey, Frankie's character began his tenure on the show's second season as the \\"enforcer\\", torturing the other students, especially the seventh graders, including Cory and Shawn Hunter. Having realized the error of his ways along with longing for true friends, Frankie reforms into a much kinder person in season 3 and begins his friendship with Cory and Shawn. Afterwards, Frankie held Cory (and to a lesser extent, Shawn) with very high esteem, often turning to them for help and advice. He enjoys writing poetry. His father is the professional wrestler Vader (whose real name is stated on the show as both Francis Albert \\"Frankie\\" Stechino, Sr., and Leslie). He has a younger brother named Herman, who develops a crush on Morgan Matthews. Oddly, he lives in the same trailer park as Shawn despite his father's high-profile career. His last appearances as a recurring character were in the fourth season, and he returned once more, along with Joey, for the graduation episode in season 5. Joey Epstein During the series' second and third seasons, Joey \\"The Rat\\" Epstein (Blake Sennett) is Harley Keiner's other \\"lackey\\", also antagonizing both Shawn and Cory. Joey's exact purpose in the bully entourage is never really explained. Sennett left the show in season three to pursue music with his band Rilo Kiley, but he made one last appearance in season five's graduation episode. Harley Keiner First appearing as the bane of Cory's existence at the start of season two, Harvey \\"Harley\\" Keiner (Danny McNulty/Kenny Johnston) was a major antagonist and recurring character for about a year of the show's run. One of the gags surrounding his character was the oddball sophistication he added to the bullying trade, often referring to the harassment of underclassmen as if it were a career and to his gang as if it were a corporation. He has a younger sister, Theresa \\"TK\\" Keiner (Danielle Harris), of whom he is overprotective. When McNulty left the cast toward the end of the second season, Harley made one more appearance (played by Kenny Johnston), only to be subsequently written out under the pretense of going to \\"juvenile boot camp\\". The original actor made one last token cameo appearance in the third season. Harley was later a recurring character on the sequel series Girl Meets World. In the interim, Harley has fully reformed into a much friendlier, compassionate person; he is shown to care a great deal about the students' well-being and is ashamed of his troubled past. Unlike their own school days, Harley and Cory have become close friends, mainly because it was Cory's influence that got him hired as custodian at John Quincy Adams Middle School, earning him the affectionate nickname \\"Janitor Harley\\" by the students. He also serves as another mentor figure to the four main kids (Cory's daughter Riley, Lucas Friar, Maya Hart, and Farkle Minkus). Of the bunch, Lucas is the one Harley forms the closest bond with. When they graduate from middle school, Harley reminds Lucas to always make good decisions moving forward. In the season 1 episode \\"Girl Meets Flaws\\", when Farkle is bullied by another student, Harley sympathizes with him and even confronts the bully about his actions. In all, Harley appeared in six episodes of the sequel, including the series finale, \\"Girl Meets Goodbye\\". Griff Hawkins When Danny McNulty left the show at the end of season 2, Griffin \\"Griff\\" Hawkins (Adam Scott) stepped in briefly as his replacement. A far different sort of bully than Harley. While much friendlier, Griff was a smooth-talking freeloader who used his wits and charm to weasel his way out of many an obligation and punishment. He was on the show from 1995‚Äì1996. In an episode of the sequel series Girl Meets World, there's an easter egg that alludes to Griff. When Cory is presenting his class with awards, he gives Maya Hart the \\"Griff Hawkins Totally Cool\\" Award. Jedidiah and Rhiannon Lawrence Jedidiah (Peter Tork, Michael McKean, and Mark Harelik) and Rhiannon Lawrence (Annette O'Toole and Marcia Cross) are Topanga's estranged parents. Dialogue suggests they were married at the same age as Cory Matthews and their daughter, Topanga, however their relationship is not as strong due to Jedidiah's (off-screen) extramarital affair with a woman named Marie. For Topanga's sake and without her knowledge, Jedidiah and Rhiannon spend years in counseling in an effort to salvage their marriage. Topanga stays with her aunt, Prudence Curtis (Olivia Hussey), in Philadelphia during the attempt. After their reconciliation failed, they eventually divorced. Rhiannon kept their house in Pittsburgh, while Jedidiah moved into an apartment. Their separation caused Topanga to doubt whether her relationship with Cory would last, which led to her breaking their engagement. However, touched by Cory's perseverance, Topanga ultimately gives their love another chance. By the time of the events of Girl Meets World, Topanga and Cory are shown happily married with two children. Rhiannon is obliquely referred to by her granddaughter Riley at the end of \\"Girl Meets 1961\\", an episode centering on Rihannon's mother, Rosie McGee. Jason Marsden Jason Marsden (Jason Marsden), Eric's best friend from the age of three. He is often more calm than Eric, and can either be his voice of reason or the one who gets him into trouble. He is quite fond of girls, as is Eric. He was on the show from 1993‚Äì1995; he left the show after graduating and going to college, leaving Eric at home to be a \\"townie\\", and was never referenced again. He was the only character on the series to have the same exact name of the actor portraying him. Janitor Bud Janitor Bud (Bob Larkin), the high school janitor, who later becomes Mr. Feeny's secretary due to Cory's getting him fired from his janitorial duties. After the change is made, he never appears on the show again, though he is referred to in an episode in a later season. He was on the show from 1994‚Äì1997. Lila Bolander Lila Bolander- Feeny (Bonnie Bartlett, William Daniels' real-life wife), Dean of Pennbrook, who later begins a romantic relationship with Mr. Feeny. She was on the show from 1997‚Äì1999. In the show, she is stereotypically portrayed as a strict, disciplinarian college administrator who is romantically attracted to George Feeny, who initially did not reciprocate her affection for years until he is under her employ. In her first appearance in the episode \\"Learning to Fly\\", she was having doubt of whether Eric Matthews of being serious of enrolling into colleges because of his less-than-stellar grades and history as a slacker, but Eric persuasively convinced her after an interview. George Feeny eventually sees the Dean's reasonable side when she is willing to trust his judgment over Cory Matthews after he started a fight with a corrupted young professor named Stuart (portrayed by Ben Savage's real-life brother Fred) who made an advance towards Topanga Lawrence. Dean Bolander had Cory under a probationary period of one day for starting physical violence on campus instead of expelling him, and the professor under an investigation for his misconduct. Bolander and Feeny fall in love afterward and eventually they are married. After marrying Feeny in the last episode of season six, she isn't seen again and is mentioned only a few times during the seventh and final season. Bolander was previously married to archeologist Dr. Curtis Kincaid (Francis X. McCarthy). In contrast with Feeny, Kincaid cares more about his personal success than the well being of others, which ultimately leads Dean Bolander to choose Feeny over Kincaid during the latter's attempt at salvaging their past marriage. Tommy Tommy (J. B. Gaynor) was an orphan that Eric, Jack, and Rachel met while Eric was playing Santa at the mall one Christmas. After Eric gave Tommy a toy for Christmas, Tommy became convinced that Eric was really Santa and asked Eric for parents for Christmas. Eric, touched by the boy's request, decided to volunteer as Tommy's Big Brother. Eric and Tommy became very close after this, to the point where Tommy refused to be adopted by anyone other than Eric. Eric found this out when he was informed that a couple in California wanted to adopt Tommy. At first, Eric tried to adopt Tommy himself, before being convinced that Tommy would have a better future with a real family. Eric finally told Tommy that he would not adopt him, though doing so left him saddened. Heartbroken, Tommy decided to go to California, but not before giving Eric one last goodbye. Tommy, now known as Thomas Jonathan \\"T. J.\\" Murphy, was next seen on Girl Meets World in \\"Girl Meets Mr. Squirrels Goes to Washington\\" as a political activist and founder of a website called Thorn in Your Side, that reports on political scandals. He volunteers to help when Eric is nominated to run for Senator from New York, though the others are unaware of his identity. Later, at a debate against Eric's opponent, Tommy reveals his identity and speaks of Eric's compassion and how Eric had sacrificed himself for Tommy's future. Eric joyfully reunites with Tommy, who expresses his desire to continue working with Eric's campaign.

The center of Totem Lake Mall consisted of an enclosed shopping mall (Lower Mall), and an adjacent strip mall (Upper Mall). Collectively, the two centers were sometimes referred to as \\"Totem Lake Malls\\". Following the redevelopment of major regional malls beginning in the 1980s, Totem Lake Mall went into steady decline, losing most of its major tenants. Multiple redevelopments for the property were proposed. Village At Totem Lake, LLC purchased the mall in 2015 and in 2016 announced it would be redeveloped and reopened as The Village at Totem Lake. Major tenants in the Lower Mall were Cartoys, Ross Dress for Less, Sleep Country USA, Famous Footwear, Family Christian Book Center, My Home Furniture brand new in 2013, 24 Hour Fitness and the stand-alone, Auto Zone and Key Bank. Spaces in the lower mall were often leased by short-term and seasonal tenants. The Upper Mall included Denny's Pet World, Guitar Center, Hallmark Cards, Trader Joe's, and Big 5 Sporting Goods. The majority of these tenants were only accessible on the outside, shying away from the interior mall concept popular throughout the 1960s-1990s. Other malls in the Seattle - Tacoma area such as Northgate Mall and Lakewood Towne Center have switched to this concept as well, having tenants on the outside as well as the inside. History The sign tower with a hidden totem pole Originally called the Totem Lake Center, the mall was first proposed in early 1968\\"$30 Million Shopping Center Planned\\". East Side Journal, April 17, 1968, P. 1 and ground was broken in June 1972.\\"Ground Broken For Totem Lake Shopping Center\\". East Side Journal, June 14, 1972, P. 8 The mall was the second phase of a larger Totem Lake center project including the Evergreen Hospital campus and nearby apartment complexes, all developed by Totem Lake, Inc. around the small lake of the same name, originally known as Lake Watstine. The mall was designed with an \\"Indian longhouse theme\\" featuring elements of Northwest Coast art by Richard C. Bouillon & Co., the same firm that designed the Lake Forest Park Center in 1964 in a chalet theme. John Graham & Company were in charge of designing the interior.\\"Indian Theme for Totem Center\\" Seattle Times 11 jun. 1972. C1.\\"Work to Begin on New Store\\" Seattle Times 21 Jan. 1973 P.H3 Although the opening of the mall was originally scheduled for April 1, 1973,\\"April 1 opening scheduled for Totem Lake Center\\". East Side Journal, January 10, 1973, p. 23 the first stores in the mall wouldn't open until May 2,\\"Grand opening held for some at Totem Lake Center\\", East Side Journal May 9, 1973, P. B1 and the rest of the lower mall until May 31, 1973.\\"Totem Center Ribbon Cut\\". East Side Journal, June 6, 1973, P. A6 The mall's Lamonts Anchor tenant/department store, the sixth in the Pay 'n Save Corporation-owned chain, was still under construction at the time, and would not open until October 17 of that year.\\"Lamonts Opens Today at Totem Lake\\", East Side Journal, October 17, 1973, p. A1 Additional anchor stores at the mall included other divisions of the Pay 'n Save Corporation including Ernst Home & Nursery, Schuck's Auto Supply, still existing until recently, a Pay 'n Save Drug store and Sportsland, later acquired by Big 5 Sporting Goods. Construction of the separate Eastern portion of the mall continued into 1974, and the East Mall was opened in July 1974. Construction of the mall would lead to the annexation of the Totem Lake Neighborhood by the city of Kirkland in 1974.\\"Totem Lake Annex Draws No Objections\\". East Side Journal, May 9, 1973, P. A5\\"Annexation Closer For Totem Lake\\". East Side Journal, January 9, 1974, P. A8 The adjacent Totem Lake Cinemas opened in 1980. In the summer of 1988, the upper and lower malls' original exposed wood facades and finishes were covered and the buildings were re-sheathed with a white Exterior insulation finishing system as part of a renovation project that was intended to modernize and brighten the appearance of the malls.\\"Is Totem Lake Strangling Itself?\\", The Seattle Times, May 4, 1988, p.H1 Many people criticized this new look deeming it boring and bland in contrast to the previous eclectic theme. A huge snow storm in 1997 caused part of the lower mall's roof to cave in, triggering the sprinklers and flooding the entire building in of water. Because of water damage, the mall's original wood parquet flooring was replaced with ceramic tile. A totem pole from the mall's original construction was thought to be hidden inside a sign tower on the mall's west side, though in reality what remained were plain wooden poles that once held the malls' original sign featuring an Eagle with outstretched wings in the Northwest Coast art tradition. The poles were left in place during redevelopment to take advantage of a grandfather clause in the city's sign height limits but the fate of the original hand-carved sign is unknown. The shopping center was previously considered a dead mall due to financial struggles and had faced a \\"steady loss of tenants\\" since the early 2000s. The mall has been described as a \\"white elephant\\". The first blow to the mall occurred in late 1996 when anchor Ernst Home & Nursery closed as part of the company's bankruptcy. The space eventually was divided into three stores, Ross, Famous Footwear and Cartoys, and given a remodel that contrasted greatly with the rest of the mall. This part of the mall remained occupied while the rest of the mall slowly languished. The main mall has many vacant spaces where anchor tenants used to be, such as Lamonts (later Gottschalks). In November 2006, the Rite Aid drugstore moved out of the mall to a free standing location up the street. CompUSA closed in May 2007. As of December 2015, the mall interior has only one major retailer: a Christian bookstore. The Old Country Buffet closed in September 2008 due to chapter 11 bankruptcy consolidation. The latest vacancy occurred in March 2010 when one of the mall's only original remaining tenants, Schuck's Auto Parts, acquired and renamed by O'Reilly Auto Parts, relocated off the mall property. Label scars (where the name of a store was displayed) still clearly indicate where many former stores were, such as Gottschalks, Radio Shack, Rite Aid, Comp USA and Grab Bag (a party supply store). The Sweet Shop (a candy store), still has signs up, despite being closed for a few years. Even a partial logo from Jay Jacobs, a local boutique that closed in 1999, is visible. Although the decor of the mall was originally themed in the style of a Native American long house, the current interior decor of the mall is from the 1980s. Sale and redevelopment The Village at Totem Lake just prior to 2017 reopening In January 2004, the mall was sold by CalPERS to Developers Diversified Realty (DDR) for $37 million. DDR has discussed plans to tear it down and redevelop a multistory, mixed residential-retail complex. As of February 2008, the City of Kirkland had not received an application for design review and did not know the planned mix of tenants, although the city did receive a conceptual master plan. In February 2009, it was revealed that due to the harsh economic climate, DDR had postponed its redevelopment plans for the mall indefinitely and was searching for someone to buy the property. In early 2015, Totem Lake Mall was sold to Village at Totem Lake LLC, a joint venture between CenterCal and PCCP, LLC. A $200 million, 12-month redevelopment of the mall was announced to begin in mid-2016, with the new mall opening in the summer of 2017. In March 2016, the mall's owner began demolishing the lower mall, with the exception of the former Ernst space which is now occupied by Car Toys and Ross; Trader Joe's took up the remaining space after construction was completed in December 2017. The upper mall and its former movie theater are next in line for demolition. The new complex, named The Village at Totem Lake, will include 400 residential units, office spaces, and entertainment venues in addition to retail space.

The band has also performed and recorded under the name Lydia Pense and Cold Blood, due to the popularity of their lead singer, Lydia Pense. History The band first came to prominence in 1969 when rock impresario Bill Graham signed them after an audition and they played the Fillmore West in San Francisco. Pense has been compared to Janis Joplin, and it was Joplin who recommended the audition to Graham. The term \\"East Bay Grease\\" has been used to describe the San Francisco Bay Area's brass horn heavy funk-rock sound of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, Cold Blood was one of the pioneer bands of this sound. Other bands include Tower of Power, Chicago, and Blood Sweat And Tears. The Tower of Power horn players have performed with Cold Blood on a regular basis since the early 1970s. Skip Mesquite and Mic Gillette have been members of both Tower of Power and Cold Blood. The band disbanded in the late 1970s. Pense suspended her music career in the early 1980s to raise her daughter Danielle, before re-forming the group in 1988. The band stabilized with its current membership in the 1990s. Cold Blood continues to record and perform today, and some former band members such as Raul Matute (and some from Tower of Power) appear on the band's most recent album.

Life He was born on 25 June 1869 in Lemberg (Lviv in present-day Ukraine), Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria (part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire), to father Wiktor, who worked as an architect, and mother Maria (n√©e Rawska), who also hailed from a well- established family of Lviv architects. After graduating from secondary school he studied architecture at the Lviv Polytechnic (1888-1892) and subsequently at the Technical University in Vienna (1892-1894). Upon completion of his studies, he became an assistant to Oswald Gruber at the university (1894-1896) and at the same time he further continued his education under Karl K√∂nig. He received his diploma from the Lviv Polytechnic in 1897. He started working as an architect first in Zygmunt Gorgolewski's team where he participated in creating the interior design of the Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet (1899), then in Ivan Levynskyi's and Wincenty Rawski's architectural studios and finally as an independent architect. His early works represent historicism, nonetheless his style, influenced by Viennese architect Otto Wagner, quickly developed into Art Nouveau making him one of the most distinguished representatives of this style in the architecture of Lviv. In 1888, Sad≈Çowski was delegated to design a new railway station for the city of Lviv, which became a turning point in his career as an architect. The construction of the building was supervised by the Director of Lviv Railways Ludwik Wierzbicki. The final project, prepared in less than a year, encompassed a large, horizontally-oriented main hall, with two large train yards located in the background. The main entrance was topped with a large dome made of bolted steel and stained glass. Both wings of the symmetrical building were constituted by two pavilions, each with a smaller cupola. He collaborated with many prominent architects and sculptors from Lviv at the time including Alfred Zachariewicz, Antoni Popiel and Edmund Zieleniewski who worked on the interior design of the railway station as well as its fa√ßade. Some of his other projects in Lviv include: Industrial School Building (47 Snopkowska Street), 1907‚Äì1908, Lewicki Jakub , Miƒôdzy tradycjƒÖ a nowoczesno≈õciƒÖ: architektura Lwowa lat 1893-1918, Neriton, 2005, p. 81 the rebuilding of Baczewski residence, 1908 Kot≈Çobu≈Çatowa Irena , Baczewski, Baczewski..., Centrum Europy, 1996 . Z. Rozwadowski's Villa , 1905 and the Lviv Philharmonic, 1905-1908. He was a member of the Polish Polytechnic Society in Lviv (Polskie Towarzystwo Politechniczne we Lwowie). In 1936, he was awarded the Commander's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta. He died on 25 May 1940 and was buried at the Lychakiv Cemetery in the tomb of the Rawski family. Personal life Sad≈Çowski was interested in music and already as a student he sang as a tenor in Lviv's Opera. He was a member of the Lutnia Singing Society and he particularly admired the works of Stanis≈Çaw Moniuszko.. He was also a passionate nature lover and a hunter. He bought an estate near Brze≈ºany where he settled in 1934 upon his retirement. The estate was later confiscated by the Soviet troops in 1939. He had two brothers: Henryk (a court judge) and Stanis≈Çaw (a city council official) as well as a sister Maria. He married Jadwiga (n√©e Wolska) with whom he had two daughters: W≈Çadys≈Çawa (a hydrogeologist) and Kazimiera (a physician).

History Franz Hein was born in Gr√∂tzingen (Baden), Germany. His high school years were spent in Leipzig, as well as, his college years at the University of Leipzig. He completed his Ph.D. in 1917 on optical studies of bismuth and triphenylmethane derivatives. Hein made Assistant at the University and in 1920 Oberassistent. He continued working on his Habilitation becoming a professor in 1923. With the completion of his Habilitation, Hein went to work on organometallic system electrochemistry.(a) Hein, F. Z.

In 1933 Hein signed the Vow of allegiance of the Professors of the German Universities and High-Schools to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialistic State. From 1941 to 1965, he worked on main-group-metal derivatives of metal carbonyls.(a) Hein, F.; Pobloth, H. Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 1941, 248, 84. (b) Hein, F.; Heuser, E. Z. Anorg. Allg.

After 1942, Hein moved from Leipzig to the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena where he became the Director of the Institute for Inorganic Chemistry. War came in March 1945 and the University was destroyed. Hein came back to help rebuild towards the end of 1946. Until his retirement, he held a position as a chair in inorganic chemistry until 1959. Phenylchromium compounds With the reaction of anhydrous chromium(III) chloride (CrCl3) and phenylmagnesium bromide (C6H5MgBr), Hein created a mixture of compounds. He was able to produce what he called phenylmagnesium salts. Hein denoted them as: (C6H5)5CrX,Hein, F. Ber. Dtsch. Chem. Ges. 1919, 52, 192. (C6H5)4CrX, and (C6H5)3CrX.Oesper, R.E. J. Chem. Educ. 1953, 30, 315. However, it was later found that the correct structures were of sandwich compound type complexes and based on biphenyl not phenyl. The discovery of ferrocene and the research done by Zeiss, Tsutsui, and others lead to this structure determination.

Au was home to the Au Squat Festival on June 3, 2006, featuring many punk rock bands such as The Restarts. The 2007 festival was on June 9 with bands such as Sensa Yuma and the 2008 festival took place on June 7 with headliners Life... But How to Live It?. Any profits went to human rights organizations and were also given to antifascist networks and other autonomous centres. Beside the open air festival there are many other concerts and cultural or political events during the year. History The Au was occupied on June 4, 1983. The Frankfurt municipality bought the building from the Deutschen Bibliothek for 4.3 million Marks in 1988. Eviction threat In the aftermath of the protests at the 2017 G20 summit in Hamburg, local politicians made statements about the Au. The FDP and Alternative for Germany (AfD) all demanded that the centre was evicted. The CDU suggested the Au paid rent. In response, the Greens and the SPD cautioned against hasty actions. Arson attacks In late 2018, there was a spate of arson attacks against left-wing projects in the Rhine-Main region. The Au was attacked twice in November with fires started in the garden. Both times the residents were able to extinguish the flames. Nobody was apprehended. In a joint statement, representatives of Au and other autonomous spaces viewed the attacks as politically motivated and blamed the ‚Äúdangerous sentiment against left projects‚Äù created by the previous statements of political parties.

The first stage, never completed, was built as the municipal offices and public hall for the former City of St Kilda in 1890. Many additions, internal alterations, and changes in appearance were made in the early and mid 20th century, while serving as the municipal and social heart of St Kilda. A devastating fire in 1991 seriously affected the art collection and burnt out the hall itself, and was followed by a prize winning refurbishment and further extension. After Council amalgamations in 1994, it became the base for the larger City of Port Phillip, and further extensions and renovations have occurred. The hall within remains popular for numerous social events, meetings and performances, a role it has served for over 120 years. History The St Kilda town hall was commissioned to replace an earlier 1859 building on the corner of Grey and Barkly Streets. This site was reserved in 1883, selected in 1887, and an elaborate towered design by architect William Pitt in an ornate Second Empire style won a limited competition in 1888. The building opened in 1890, but in incomplete form, with only the hall, the front wing and Carlisle Street wings built, the brick walls left unrendered and undecorated, and the portico and tower not built. In 1892, instead of completing the building, a large pipe organ by noted firm George Fincham was installed in the hall. The 1890s depression which started that same year prevented any further work for many years. In 1925 the large classical portico, similar to but not the same as Pitt's design, was built, along with the current elaborate internal stair-hall. Though generally known as the Town Hall, the portico proclaims the building as a City Hall. The building's other brick walls stayed bare until 1957 when they were finally stuccoed over and painted white, in a simplified classical form without any elaboration, not even the column capitals. In 1939 a new Art Deco style Council Chamber was included as part of an addition on the Brighton Road side, while in 1971 a modernist addition was made to the Carlisle Street side. In the early hours of Sunday 7 April 1991, fire gutted the hall itself, and resulting in loss of the internal decoration, the organ, and destruction or severe damage to the many works of art that lined the halls. Arson was suspected. The office portion of the building was soon repaired, and firm of ARM Architecture tasked with the restoration of the hall and building a new entry on the Carlisle Street side, and offices to the rear, completed in 1994. The hall was not fully restored, but instead a new ceiling was created, the hall divided in two, some of the plasterwork restored, and some left in its damaged state. This work won two Royal Australian Institute of Architects awards in 1995. A further expansion took place in the 2000s on the Carlisle Street side completed in February 2008, incorporating the dividing glass wall removed from the hall, opening it up again. The Town Hall sits in an unusually spacious setting, with sweeping lawns and a circular driveway leading to the grand front staircase and portico. A Social Centre Along with the usual municipal balls, receptions, and functions, the hall has hosted many events over its long history. In the 1930s, unemployed people picked up their sugar bags of donated food during the Great Depression; a thousand women in hats, gloves, pearls and floral frocks joined the Queen Mother for morning tea in 1958; and the last of former prime minister Gough Whitlam's \\"It's Time\\" rallies was held there in 1972. It was a major ballroom dancing venue throughout the mid and latter part of the twentieth century, when Ballroom dancing was a popular pastime, curtailed when the hall was divided in two as part of the 1994 works (since reversed). For the 1956 Summer Olympics, the building hosted the fencing events.1956 Summer Olympics official report. p. 44. The main hall, other rooms, and even the Council Chamber can be booked for events, making the building well used. In 2015, the hall was the venue for the popular St Kilda Short Film Festival.

This was Latvia's debut entry, making them the last of the Baltic states to debut at the Contest. The song is compared by at least one author on the Contest to the work of Oasis, in that it is a pop song written in something close to the britpop style. Lyrically, the song deals with lead singer RenƒÅrs Kaupers (who wrote and composed the song under the pseudonym Reynard Cowper) and his feelings for his lover. He tells her that \\"I will follow my star till the end of my days/And my heart's gonna lead me through so many ways\\" before asking her to \\"be my runaway-bride\\". The band's performance is also memorable. Kaupers danced in a relatively eccentric manner, provoking cheers from the audience. In late 2005, as part of his hosting duties at the Congratulations special, he was asked about his dancing abilities by co-host Katrina Leskanich. Kaupers' response that he danced very well prompted further cheers from the live audience as well as a repeat of his moves. The song was performed twenty-first on the night, following Finland's Nina √Östr√∂m with \\"A Little Bit\\" and preceding Turkey's Pƒ±nar Ayhan & The SOS with \\"Yorgunum anla\\". At the close of voting, it had received 136 points, placing 3rd in a field of 24. Kaupers would later characterise this result as \\"we were beaten by two brothers\\", a joking reference to Denmark's Olsen Brothers, who won that year with Fly on the Wings of Love. The song has become something of a fan favourite in Contest history, appearing on the CD and DVD compilations produced to coincide with the \\"Congratulations\\" special. It was succeeded as Latvian representative at the 2001 Contest by Arnis Mednis with Too Much.

In 2014 Rough Edges Press published Palmetto Empire by David Hardy. This novel follows the fictional adventures of backwoodsmen, outlaws, and rebels in the era of the First Seminole War. Films It was during the 1950s that most of these films were produced and many included a fictional and stereotypical portrayal of the real life Seminole leader, Osceola, who resisted American expansion into Florida during the late 1830s. The film Distant Drums (1951), which was one of the earliest Florida Westerns made, even changed his name to Oscala and portrayed him as a malevolent savage, filled with a constant blood lust who fed living prisoners to alligators. One of the advantages of these types of films, however, was that the producers often used the Florida Everglades as a backdrop. Now a contemporary audience has the benefit of glimpsing this wilderness in its mid 20th century form. The producers of Distant Drums even used the historic Castillo de San Marcos fort as a backdrop for the story. It was depicted as a fictitious stronghold for Spanish gunrunners selling armaments to the Seminole on the west coast of Florida, although it is actually located on the east coast.

If activated to federal service, the Wing is gained by the United States Air Force Air Mobility Command. Overview The 139th Airlift Wing provides the State of Missouri and the nation with immediately deployable, combat-ready C-130H2 Hercules model aircraft. The 139th remains globally engaged in continuing operations. Units The 139th Airlift Wing consists of the following units: * 139th Operations Group : 180th Airlift Squadron * 139th Maintenance Group * 139th Mission Support Group * 139th Medical Group History On 14 April 1962, the Missouri Air National Guard 180th Air Transport Squadron was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 139th Air Transport Group was established by the National Guard Bureau, the 180th ATS becoming the group's flying squadron. Other squadrons assigned into the group were the 139th Headquarters, 139th Material Squadron (Maintenance), 139th Combat Support Squadron, and the 139th USAF Dispensary. The 139th Air Transport Group was assigned to Military Air Transport Service (MATS), equipped with 4-engined C-97 Stratofreighter transports. From St. Joseph, the 180th augmented MATS airlift capability worldwide in support of the Air Force's needs. Throughout the 1960s, the unit flew long-distance transport missions in support of Air Force requirements, frequently sending aircraft to Europe, Alaska, the Caribbean, Hawaii, Japan, the Philippines, and during the Vietnam War, to both South Vietnam, Okinawa and Thailand. With the realignment of MATS to Military Airlift Command (MAC), the squadron was re-designated as a Military Airlift Squadron on 8 January 1966.

Under SAC the group became an Air Refueling unit, being with the air refueling version of the C-97 transport, the KC-97 Stratotanker. Familiarity with the aircraft led to a smooth transition from MAC to the new refueling mission. It supported the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) flying aerial refueling missions in the KC-97 supporting missions of deploying aircraft to NATO for tactical exercises.  Tactical Airlift In 1976 the KC-97s were retired by SAC and the unit was returned to MAC. The 139th was re-equipped with C-130A Hercules tactical airlifters and returned to its transport mission. With the C-130s the 180th supported Operation Volant Oak and Operation Coronet Oak at Howard Air Force Base, Panama. During a 180th deployment to Howard AFB in November, 1978, they were caught up in a \\"real world\\" situation when the world began to learn of the events unfolding in Jonestown, Guyana. The 180th, flying the C-130, was the first US military aircraft landing at Timehri International Airport, Guyana with US embassy officials that they had picked up in Venezuela as well as food and supplies meant for the survivors the Americans hoped to take out of Guyana. That, of course, was before it became apparent that most of the more than 900 Peoples Temple members were lying dead in Jonestown. In December, 1989, the 180th was once again deployed at Howard AFB when Operation Just Cause began. The 180th flew combat mission in support of the Operation. In late 1980 and through 1983, members of the 180th embarked on a special project to enhance survivability of C-130 aircrews while flying in a hostile environment. The need for this type of training became apparent after C-130 units from the Military Airlift Command (MAC) began to participate in Red Flag at Nellis AFB. It was obvious that the C-130's were not doing well against the ground and air threats posed in the Red Flag exercise. After approval from the National Guard Bureau and tacitly from Military Airlift Command (MAC), they began service test to validate the training program. After more than three service test, the program proved it worth and the Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Center was approved and instituted on 4 February 1984. In March 1987, the 180th began to receive brand new C-130H2 Hercules aircraft replacing the C-130A model aircraft they had flown for the past ten years. In October 1987, the 180th deployed two C-130H2 aircraft supporting a United States Army Special Forces (SF) and the Royal Australian Special Air Service Regiment (SAS) in a joint personnel airdrop exercise called Badge Anvil 1987 at RAAF Learmonth, Australia. The exercise provided high altitude low opening and high altitude high opening parachute training. Since all of the airdrops occurred above 10,000 feet and as high as 24,500 feet, the 15th Physiological Training Flight, USAF, also supported the exercise and provided supplemental oxygen equipment, training and support for the training missions. Each flight was like going to the altitude chamber. In 1989, the 180th with four C-130H2 aircraft deployed to Kimhae International Airport, Republic of Korea in support of Operation Team Spirit 1989. During the exercise, the 180th flew challenging missions including tactical resupply, fuel bladder missions, assault landings on short runways including landing on highway landing strips, numerous airdrop missions including both visual, high altitude and radar drop scenarios. 1991 Gulf War 180th Tactical Airlift Squadron flying over Kuwait 1991 The 180th Tactical Airlift Squadron was ordered to the active service on 28 December 1990, as a result of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait to support Operation Desert Shield. For some unit members, this would be a return to the Persian Gulf as they had volunteered and deployed with 2 C-130H aircraft, aircrews, maintenance and support personnel, to form the first Air National Guard provisional airlift squadron in September 1990. On 2 January 1991, the 180th TAS and its 8 C-130H aircraft and personnel departed Rosecrans Air National Guard Base for Al Ain Air Base, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and were redesignated as the 1632nd Tactical Airlift Squadron (Provisional) as part of the 1630th Tactical Airlift Wing (Provisional) which was under the 1610th Airlift Division (Provisional). The unit remained at Al Ain Air Base through the air war and the ground war flying combat and combat support missions in support of the allied operations. Beginning on 22 March 1991, the 180th TAS redeployed to Al Kharj Air Base, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The 180th TAS departed Al Kharj Air Base on 28 May 1991, and returned to Rosecrans Air National Guard Base on 30 May 1991. When the aircraft arrived home, they had \\"nose art\\" on each courtesy of the crew chiefs. The nose art was 391 \\"Connie Kay\\", 392 \\"Desert Possum\\", 393 \\"Spirit of St. Joe\\", 394 \\"The Hog\\", 395 \\"Chief\\", 396 \\"Buzzard\\", 397 \\"Riders on the Storm\\" and 398 \\"Fike's Filly\\". The 180th TAS was relieved from active duty and released back to state control on 24 June 1991. During the 1990s, the 180th provided airlift support to the United States Air Forces Europe during the airlift operations into Bosnia and Herzegovina. These operations were named Operation Provide Promise, Operation Joint Endeavor, Operation Joint Guard and Operation Joint Forge. Members of the 180th along with operations support and maintenance personnel would deploy to Rhein-Main Air Base and, after it closed, to Ramstein Air Base and assigned to \\"Delta Squadron\\". The Air National Guard would generally be responsible for a 90- or 120-day period and guard members would typically volunteer for duty for a minimum of a two- to three-week period although some would volunteer for longer periods. Global War on Terrorism Following the attacks on 11 September 2001, the 180th served in a support role flying missions transporting personnel and equipment in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The 180th Airlift Squadron was notified in February 2003 that it would be partially mobilized as a result of the impending conflict in Iraq which would later be known as Operation Iraqi Freedom. The unit deployed in March 2003 to the Iraqi theater and later supported Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and was released from active duty in March 2006 and reverted to state control. This was a historic partial mobilization that lasted three years. The 180th remained in a state of partial activation for three years until it was released from mobilization in March 2006 and reverted to state control.

Although this is the third episode overall in the series, it is listed as the second episode on the first season DVD release, while \\"The Box and the Bunny\\" was listed as episode 3. Plot At a club to celebrate Daniel's first issue party, Bradford congratulates Daniel on coming through as MODE's editor-in-chief, but Wilhelmina spoils the festivities when she brings up Daniel's older brother Alex, who was the editor-in-chief at sister publication Hudson. The word of his late brother proves unsettling for Daniel, which prompts him to set out to prove to his father and Wilhelmina that he can be as capable as his brother in running a magazine. This gives him the idea to revamp MODE in an effort to attract a more upbeat audience. Meanwhile, Betty goes home after being turned away from the party, and discovers Walter playing Dance Dance Revolution 2 with Justin. When Betty asks why he is here, Walter turns the issue around by saying it was Betty who dumped him but Betty doesn't buy that line and tells him to leave. She also finds herself given a lecture on not fitting in with their own kind by Hilda, who thinks that she needs to change her look a bit, but Betty says no. Betty also discovers that her dad is drinking coffee knowing full well that he has a heart condition and he was told by his doctor to lay off the caffeine, prompting Betty to make him take his pills in front of her. The next day Daniel enlists Betty for a brainstorming session to change the look of MODE by looking through back issues of Hudson for inspiration. When Betty discovers a series of past layouts from Vincent Bianchi, Daniel advises Betty that Bianchi vowed that he would never work for Mode because of differences of opinion with Daniel's brother, Alex. While at home Betty learns from Ignacio (her Dad) that he knew Bianchi and his family as they only lived four blocks away from them. With this info, Betty uses her Queens connections to entice Vincent to do a photo shoot for Mode. Daniel asks Betty to book a meeting at a posh restaurant, and says that Betty is to come along. Daniel insists that Betty dress up for the occasion, she in turn enlists Hilda to help with the makeover. This doesn't end well, especially at the board meeting where not only does Daniel's idea of changing MODE get laughed at, but so does Betty when Wilhelmina compares the MODE changes to Betty's new look. Embarrassed, Betty decides not to go to the restaurant, leaving Daniel with no choice but to take Amanda (pretending to be Betty) and Bradford (who decides to tag along). As the three pitch the proposal to Vincent, Betty discovers the proposal document has been left behind on her desk and decides to deliver it to the restaurant herself (and in the process Betty snaps at Marc, who tried to cut her off, and is put in his place). Betty's arrival at the restaurant proves to be a lifesaver when Vincent finally gets his chance to meet the real Betty he liked on the phone, thus once again coming through for MODE (again foiling Wilhelmina, who breaks everything in her office except for the vase and flowers, which was saved by Marc). In other scenarios, Bradford begins the search for the vehicle that was involved in Fey's death and orders Steve to track it down. Steve later finds the vehicle in an auto salvage yard in Bayonne but sends Bradford an e-mail showing the burned car up for sale on an auction website. It also turns out that the mystery woman seems to know about this as well and calls Daniel to ask him about the junkyard where the car was. When Daniel asks about this, Bradford lies saying he doesn't know anything about it and claims that the person calling was a prank. The mystery woman again meets with Wilhelmina and explains their strategy on how to further drive a wedge between Daniel and Bradford by using the car and Alex as examples. Earlier, Wilhelmina plans for her big date with a senator and has Marc prepare her office (which she destroys after the Bianchi agreement is clinched) to make it look like she is in charge. Unfortunately her date isn't impressed especially as she is not yet Editor-in-chief: The senator turns out to be Wilhelmina's father.

However, all those above him flew in single-seat fighters, whereas Atkey gained all his victories in heavier two-seater aircraft, becoming the highest scoring two-seater pilot of the war. Early life and family background Atkey was born in Toronto, Ontario, on 16 August 1894, the second of five children born to Alfred Atkey, a builder and farmer, and his wife Annie Evelyn (n√©e Shaw). His grandfather, also Alfred, was born in Newport, Isle of Wight, in 1848, and had emigrated to Canada with his parents in the 1850s. In 1906, his family moved west to Nunebor, Saskatchewan. Atkey later returned to Toronto to work for the Toronto Evening Telegram as a journalist. Military service Atkey enlisted into the British Army, joining the 2/24th Battalion, London Regiment, a Territorial Force unit that was stationed in England until sent to France in June 1916. On 19 October Atkey was commissioned as a second lieutenant (on probation) in the Royal Flying Corps, and was confirmed in his rank in September 1917. He was then posted to No. 18 Squadron to fly the Airco DH.4 day bomber. He and his gunners claimed nine victories between 4 February and 21 April 1918. He was then transferred to No. 22 Squadron to fly the Bristol F.2b fighter/reconnaissance aircraft in \\"A\\" Flight, paired with Lieutenant Charles George Gass as his gunner/observer. On 7 May Atkey and Gass took part in an historic dogfight north-east of Arras, known as the \\"Two Against Twenty\\", when Atkey and Gass, with John Gurdon and Anthony Thornton, fought twenty German scout aircraft. Atkey and Gass shot down five enemy aircraft while Gurdon and Thornton accounted for three. Two days later, Atkey and Gass again shot down five enemy aircraft in a single day. The next day, 10 May, Atkey was appointed a flight commander with the acting rank of captain. Atkey claimed a further 19 aircraft between 15 May and 2 June, and was then was posted to back to the Home Establishment in England. Bristol F.2b Fighter Atkey was subsequently awarded the Military Cross and a Bar to the award. The first was gazetted on 22 June 1918. His citation read: The Bar was gazetted on 13 September 1918, reading: Atkey was transferred to the Royal Air Force unemployed list on 3 May 1919. Post-war life In March 1919, Atkey married Irene E. Marshall (b. 1900 in London, England) in Portsmouth, Hampshire. They moved to the United States, and in 1920 were resident in Brooklyn, New York. On 23 January 1924, Atkey was living in Los Angeles, employed as a writer, when he filed a \\"Declaration of Intention\\", the first step in becoming a naturalized American citizen. In the declaration he stated that he had arrived in Seattle from Vancouver aboard the in November 1923, and had previously resided at North Battleford, Canada, and that his wife was currently living in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. It is unclear if Atkey actually became an American citizen, but on 26 August 1942 he was married for a second time to Dulcie May Boadway (b. circa 1914) in Toronto, Ontario. They had four children, Alfred (b. 1943), Donna (b. 1945), George (b. 1951) and Susan (b. 1953). Atkey died in Toronto, on 10 February 1971, and is buried in Springcreek Cemetery, Mississauga, Ontario. His gravestone describes him as a flying officer in the Royal Canadian Air Force, though details of his later military service are unknown.

Orphaned technology refers to software, such as abandonware and antique software, but also to computer hardware and practices. In computer software standards and documentation, deprecation is the gradual phasing-out of a software or programming language feature, while orphaning usually connotes a sudden discontinuation, usually for business-related reasons, of a product with an active user base. For users of technologies that have been withdrawn from the market, there is a choice between maintaining their software support environments in some form of emulation, or switching to other supported products, possibly losing capabilities unique to their original solution. Abandoning a technology is not only due to bad or outmoded idea. There are instances, such as the case of some medical technologies, where products are phased out the market because they are no longer viable as business ventures. Some orphaned technologies do not suffer complete abandonment or obsolescence. For instance, there is the case of IBM's Silicon Germanium (SiGe) technology, which is a program that produced an in situ doped alloy as a replacement for the conventional implantation step in silicon semiconductor bipolar process. The technology was previously orphaned but was continued again by a small team at IBM so that it emerged as a leading product in the high-volume communications marketplace. Technologies orphaned due to failure on the part of their startup developers can be picked up by another investor. This is demonstrated by Wink, an IoT technology orphaned when its parent company Quirky filed for bankruptcy. The platform, however, continued after it was purchased by another company called Flex. Some well-known examples of orphaned technology include: * Coleco ADAM - 8-bit home computer * TI 99/4A - 16-bit home computer * Mattel Aquarius * Apple Lisa - 16/32-bit graphical computer * Newton PDA (Apple Newton) - tablet computer * DEC Alpha - 64-bit microprocessor * HyperCard - hypermedia * ICAD (KBE) - knowledge-based engineering * Javelin Software - modeling and data analysis * LISP machines - LISP oriented computers * Classic Mac OS - m68k and PowerPC operating system * Microsoft Bob - graphical helper * Windows 9x - x86 operating system * OpenDoc - compound documents (Mac OS, OS/2) * Prograph - visual programming system * Poly-1 - parallel networked computer designed in New Zealand for use in education and training * Mosaic notation program - music notation application by Mark of the Unicorn(19 August 2008).

CNET Symbolics Inc's operating systems, Genera and OpenGenera, were twice orphaned, as they were ported from LISP machines to computers using the Alpha 64-bit CPU. User groups often exist for specific orphaned technologies, such as The Hong Kong Newton User Group, Symbolics Lisp [Machines] Users' Group (now known as the Association of Lisp Users), and Newton Reference.

It is closely related to comparative physiology and evolutionary physiology. Ernst Haeckel's coinage bionomy is sometimes employed as a synonym.Ernst Haeckel, The Wonders of Life: \\"I proposed long ago to call this special part of biology ≈ìcology (the science of home-relations) or bionomy.\\" \\"  Plants  Plant ecophysiology is concerned largely with two topics: mechanisms (how plants sense and respond to environmental change) and scaling or integration (how the responses to highly variable conditions‚Äîfor example, gradients from full sunlight to 95% shade within tree canopies‚Äîare coordinated with one another), and how their collective effect on plant growth and gas exchange can be understood on this basis. In many cases, animals are able to escape unfavourable and changing environmental factors such as heat, cold, drought or floods, while plants are unable to move away and therefore must endure the adverse conditions or perish (animals go places, plants grow places). Plants are therefore phenotypically plastic and have an impressive array of genes that aid in acclimating to changing conditions. It is hypothesized that this large number of genes can be partly explained by plant species' need to live in a wider range of conditions. Light Light is the food of plants, i.e. the form of energy that plants use to build themselves and reproduce. The organs harvesting light in plants are leaves and the process through which light is converted into biomass is photosynthesis. The response of photosynthesis to light is called light response curve of net photosynthesis (PI curve). The shape is typically described by a non- rectangular hyperbola. Three quantities of the light response curve are particularly useful in characterising a plant's response to light intensities. The inclined asymptote has a positive slope representing the efficiency of light use, and is called called quantum efficiency; the x-intercept is the light intensity at which biochemical assimilation (gross assimilation) balances leaf respiration so that the net CO2 exchange of the leaf is zero, called light compensation point; and an horizontal asymptote representing the maximum assimilation rate. Sometimes after reaching the maximum assimilation declines for processes collectively known as photoinhibition. As with most abiotic factors, light intensity (irradiance) can be both suboptimal and excessive. Suboptimal light (shade) typically occurs at the base of a plant canopy or in an understory environment. Shade tolerant plants have a range of adaptations to help them survive the altered quantity and quality of light typical of shade environments. Excess light occurs at the top of canopies and on open ground when cloud cover is low and the sun's zenith angle is low, typically this occurs in the tropics and at high altitudes. Excess light incident on a leaf can result in photoinhibition and photodestruction. Plants adapted to high light environments have a range of adaptations to avoid or dissipate the excess light energy, as well as mechanisms that reduce the amount of injury caused. Light intensity is also an important component in determining the temperature of plant organs (energy budget). Temperature In response to extremes of temperature, plants can produce various proteins. These protect them from the damaging effects of ice formation and falling rates of enzyme catalysis at low temperatures, and from enzyme denaturation and increased photorespiration at high temperatures. As temperatures fall, production of antifreeze proteins and dehydrins increases. As temperatures rise, production of heat shock proteins increases. Metabolic imbalances associated with temperature extremes result in the build-up of reactive oxygen species, which can be countered by antioxidant systems. Cell membranes are also affected by changes in temperature and can cause the membrane to lose its fluid properties and become a gel in cold conditions or to become leaky in hot conditions. This can affect the movement of compounds across the membrane. To prevent these changes, plants can change the composition of their membranes. In cold conditions, more unsaturated fatty acids are placed in the membrane and in hot conditions more saturated fatty acids are inserted. Infrared image showing the importance of transpiration in keeping leaves cool. Plants can avoid overheating by minimising the amount of sunlight absorbed and by enhancing the cooling effects of wind and transpiration. Plants can reduce light absorption using reflective leaf hairs, scales, and waxes. These features are so common in warm dry regions that these habitats can be seen to form a 'silvery landscape' as the light scatters off the canopies. Some species, such as Macroptilium purpureum, can move their leaves throughout the day so that they are always orientated to avoid the sun (paraheliotropism). Knowledge of these mechanisms has been key to breeding for heat stress tolerance in agricultural plants. Plants can avoid the full impact of low temperature by altering their microclimate. For example, Raoulia plants found in the uplands of New Zealand are said to resemble 'vegetable sheep' as they form tight cushion-like clumps to insulate the most vulnerable plant parts and shield them from cooling winds. The same principle has been applied in agriculture by using plastic mulch to insulate the growing points of crops in cool climates in order to boost plant growth. Water Too much or too little water can damage plants. If there is too little water then tissues will dehydrate and the plant may die. If the soil becomes waterlogged then the soil will become anoxic (low in oxygen), which can kill the roots of the plant. The ability of plants to access water depends on the structure of their roots and on the water potential of the root cells. When soil water content is low, plants can alter their water potential to maintain a flow of water into the roots and up to the leaves (Soil plant atmosphere continuum). This remarkable mechanism allows plants to lift water as high as 120 m by harnessing the gradient created by transpiration from the leaves.Lincoln Taiz and Eduardo Zeiger, A Companion to Plant Physiology In very dry soil, plants close their stomata to reduce transpiration and prevent water loss. The closing of the stomata is often mediated by chemical signals from the root (i.e., abscisic acid). In irrigated fields, the fact that plants close their stomata in response to drying of the roots can be exploited to 'trick' plants into using less water without reducing yields (see partial rootzone drying). The use of this technique was largely developed by Dr Peter Dry and colleagues in AustraliaPartial Rootzone Drying: A History (see nominative determinism). If drought continues, the plant tissues will dehydrate, resulting in a loss of turgor pressure that is visible as wilting. As well as closing their stomata, most plants can also respond to drought by altering their water potential (osmotic adjustment) and increasing root growth. Plants that are adapted to dry environments (Xerophytes) have a range of more specialized mechanisms to maintain water and/or protect tissues when desiccation occurs. Waterlogging reduces the supply of oxygen to the roots and can kill a plant within days. Plants cannot avoid waterlogging, but many species overcome the lack of oxygen in the soil by transporting oxygen to the root from tissues that are not submerged. Species that are tolerant of waterlogging develop specialised roots near the soil surface and aerenchyma to allow the diffusion of oxygen from the shoot to the root. Roots that are not killed outright may also switch to less oxygen-hungry forms of cellular respiration.The Impact of Flooding Stress on Plants and Crops Species that are frequently submerged have evolved more elaborate mechanisms that maintain root oxygen levels, such as the aerial roots seen in mangrove forests. However, for many terminally overwatered houseplants, the initial symptoms of waterlogging can resemble those due to drought. This is particularly true for flood-sensitive plants that show drooping of their leaves due to epinasty (rather than wilting).  concentration is vital for plant growth, as it is the substrate for photosynthesis. Plants take in through stomatal pores on their leaves. At the same time as enters the stomata, moisture escapes. This trade-off between gain and water loss is central to plant productivity. The trade-off is all the more critical as Rubisco, the enzyme used to capture , is efficient only when there is a high concentration of in the leaf. Some plants overcome this difficulty by concentrating within their leaves using carbon fixation or Crassulacean acid metabolism. However, most species used carbon fixation and must open their stomata to take in whenever photosynthesis is taking place. Plant Productivity in a Warming World The concentration of in the atmosphere is rising due to deforestation and the combustion of fossil fuels. This would be expected to increase the efficiency of photosynthesis and possibly increase the overall rate of plant growth. This possibility has attracted considerable interest in recent years, as an increased rate of plant growth could absorb some of the excess and reduce the rate of global warming. Extensive experiments growing plants under elevated using Free-Air Concentration Enrichment have shown that photosynthetic efficiency does indeed increase. Plant growth rates also increase, by an average of 17% for above-ground tissue and 30% for below-ground tissue.Effects of Rising Atmospheric Concentrations of Carbon Dioxide on Plants However, detrimental impacts of global warming, such as increased instances of heat and drought stress, mean that the overall effect is likely to be a reduction in plant productivity. Reduced plant productivity would be expected to accelerate the rate of global warming. Overall, these observations point to the importance of avoiding further increases in atmospheric rather than risking runaway climate change. Wind Wind has three very different effects on plants. * It affects the exchanges of mass (water evaporation, ) and of energy (heat) between the plant and the atmosphere by renewing the air at the contact with the leaves (convection). * It is sensed as signal driving a wind-acclimation syndrome by the plant known as thigmomorphogenesis, leading to modified growth and development and eventually to wind hardening. * Its drag force can damage the plant (leaf abrasion, wind ruptures in branches and stems and windthrows and toppling in trees and lodging in crops).  Exchange of mass and energy  Wind influences the way leaves regulate moisture, heat, and carbon dioxide. When no wind is present, a layer of still air builds up around each leaf. This is known as the boundary layer and in effect insulates the leaf from the environment, providing an atmosphere rich in moisture and less prone to convective heating or cooling. As wind speed increases, the leaf environment becomes more closely linked to the surrounding environment. It may become difficult for the plant to retain moisture as it is exposed to dry air. On the other hand, a moderately high wind allows the plant to cool its leaves more easily when exposed to full sunlight. Plants are not entirely passive in their interaction with wind. Plants can make their leaves less vulnerable to changes in wind speed, by coating their leaves in fine hairs (trichomes) to break up the air flow and increase the boundary layer. In fact, leaf and canopy dimensions are often finely controlled to manipulate the boundary layer depending on the prevailing environmental conditions.  Acclimation  Plants can sense the wind through the deformation of its tissues. This signal leads to inhibits the elongation and stimulates the radial expansion of their shoots, while increasing the development of their root system. This syndrome of responses known as thigmomorphogenesis results in shorter, stockier plants with strengthened stems, as well as to an improved anchorage. It was once believed that this occurs mostly in very windy areas. But it has been found that it happens even in areas with moderate winds, so that wind-induced signal were found to be a major ecological factor. Trees have a particularly well- developed capacity to reinforce their trunks when exposed to wind. From the practical side, this realisation prompted arboriculturalists in the UK in the 1960s to move away from the practice of staking young amenity trees to offer artificial support.  Wind damage  Wind can damage most of the organs of the plants. Leaf abrasion (due to the rubbing of leaves and branches or to the effect of air-borne particle such as sand) and leaf of branch breakage are rather common phenomena, that plants have to accommodate. In the more extreme cases, plants can be mortally damaged or uprooted by wind. This has been a major selective pressure acting over terrestrial plants. Nowadays, it is one of the major threatening for agriculture and forestry even in temperate zones. It is worse for agriculture in hurricane-prone regions, such as the banana- growing Windward Islands in the Caribbean. When this type of disturbance occurs in natural systems, the only solution is to ensure that there is an adequate stock of seeds or seedlings to quickly take the place of the mature plants that have been lost- although, in many cases a successional stage will be needed before the ecosystem can be restored to its former state.  Animals   Humans  The environment can have major influences on human physiology. Environmental effects on human physiology are numerous; one of the most carefully studied effects is the alterations in thermoregulation in the body due to outside stresses. This is necessary because in order for enzymes to function, blood to flow, and for various body organs to operate, temperature must remain at consistent, balanced levels. Thermoregulation To achieve this, the body alters three main things to achieve a constant, normal body temperature: *Heat transfer to the epidermis *The rate of evaporation *The rate of heat production The hypothalamus plays an important role in thermoregulation. It connects to thermal receptors in the dermis, and detects changes in surrounding blood to make decisions of whether to stimulate internal heat production, or to stimulate evaporation. There are two main types of stresses that can be experienced due to extreme environmental temperatures: heat stress and cold stress. Heat stress is physiologically combated in four ways: radiation, conduction, convection, and evaporation. Cold stress is physiologically combated by shivering, accumulation of body fat, circulatory adaptations (that provide an efficient transfer of heat to the epidermis), and increased blood flow to the extremities. There is one part of the body fully equipped to deal with cold stress. The respiratory system protects itself against damage by warming the incoming air to 80-90 degrees Fahrenheit before it reaches the bronchi. This means that not even the most frigid of temperatures can damage the respiratory tract. In both types of temperature related stress, it is important to remain well-hydrated. Hydration reduces cardiovascular strain, enhances the ability of energy processes to occur, and reduces feelings of exhaustion. Altitude Extreme temperatures are not the only obstacles that humans face. High altitudes also pose serious physiological challenges on the body. Some of these effects are reduced arterial P_{{\\\\mathrm{O}}_2}, the rebalancing of the acid-base content in body fluids, increased hemoglobin, increased RBC synthesis, enhanced circulation, and increased levels of the glycolysis byproduct 2,3 diphosphoglycerate, which promotes off-loading of O2 by hemoglobin in the hypoxic tissues. Environmental factors can play a huge role in the human body's fight for homeostasis. However, humans have found ways to adapt, both physiologically and tangibly.  Scientists  George A. Bartholomew (1919‚Äì2006) was a founder of animal physiological ecology. He served on the faculty at UCLA from 1947 to 1989, and almost 1,200 individuals can trace their academic lineages to him.BartGen Tree Knut Schmidt-Nielsen (1915‚Äì2007) was also an important contributor to this specific scientific field as well as comparative physiology. Hermann Rahn (1912‚Äì1990) was an early leader in the field of environmental physiology. Starting out in the field of zoology with a PhD from University of Rochester (1933), Rahn began teaching physiology at the University of Rochester in 1941. It is there that he partnered with Wallace O. Fenn to publish A Graphical Analysis of the Respiratory Gas Exchange in 1955. This paper included the landmark O2-CO2 diagram, which formed basis for much of Rahn's future work. Rahn's research into applications of this diagram led to the development of aerospace medicine and advancements in hyperbaric breathing and high-altitude respiration. Rahn later joined the University at Buffalo in 1956 as the Lawrence D. Bell Professor and Chairman of the Department of Physiology. As Chairman, Rahn surrounded himself with outstanding faculty and made the University an international research center in environmental physiology.

Life Joseph's family originally lived at Cuenca, Spain. When the Jews were expelled from Spain the family settled at Avignon. At the age of five Joseph left Avignon with his father and went to Genoa, where they remained until 1516. Driven from that city, they went to Novi, but returned to Genoa in 1538, where Joseph practiced medicine for twelve years. On June 3, 1550, he and all his coreligionists were driven from Genoa as a consequence of the rivalry of the non-Jewish physicians. Joseph then settled at Voltaggio, at the request of the citizens of that small town, practicing there until 1567. When the Jews were driven out of the territory of Genoa, he went to Costeletto (Montferrat), where he was very well received. In 1571 he was again established at Genoa, where he died a few years later. Joseph ha-Kohen had three sons (Joshua, Isaac, Judah) and two daughters. As for his brother Todros, he has tentatively been identified by Robert Bonfil with Ludovico Carretto, who is known to have converted from Judaism. Joseph ha-Kohen was highly regarded as a historian and physician. One of his chief concerns was also the release of the many Jewish captives taken by the vessels of the Italian republics and by the Corsairs; as in 1532, when Andrea Doria captured many Jews on taking Coron, Patras, and Zante; in 1535, when the emperor Charles V took Tunis; in 1542, when the galleys of Cegala Visconti had imprisoned a number of Jews. Historical works In Hebrew literature Joseph ha-Kohen achieved prominence by two historical works. His major work, Dibre ha-Yamim le-Malke Zarfat we-'Otoman (Chronicles of the Kings of France and Turkey), is in the nature of a history of the world, in the form of annals, in which he represents the sequence of events as a conflict between Asia and Europe, between Islam and Christianity, the protagonist for Islam being the mighty Turkish empire, and for Christianity, France. With these two great groups he connects European history, beginning with the downfall of the Roman empire. In this he also includes narratives of persecutions of Jews during the first and second crusades, copied from eye-witness reports available to him in manuscript. The work was printed in 1554 at Venice but later put on index (Amnon Raz- Krakotzkin). It was reprinted in Amsterdam in 1733. Parts were translated into German and French; the entire work was issued in English, but badly translated, by Bialloblotzky. He continued, however, the work on it, as is evident from autographs preserved in British Library. He undoubtedly tried to be a careful historian. He gathered his facts from all possible sources, made notes, kept registers, and conducted a wide correspondence. He added continually to the first redaction of his works, carefully dating each one. Of his second chronicle Emeq ha-Bakha (The Vale of Tears) he thus made at least four updated editions. Yet his style is monotonous, although he tries to write in a biblical style. Having lived in Italy from his childhood and become acquainted with persons prominent politically, he is a valuable source for the history of his time; concerning many events, he had examined witnesses. He also mentions a number of important facts ignored by other historians. He is less accurate in the treatment of ancient history, for which he often was obliged to consult untrustworthy sources. This is the first known work by a Jewish writer describing the history of non-Jews. The Jewish Annals His second chronicle is an extract from his world chronicle of items concerning persecutions of the Jews. To this he added material from Samuel Usque's Consola√ßam as Tribula√ßoens de Ysrael (1557), the chronicle of Abraham ibn Daud as well as other material that had reached him, calling it Emeq ha-Bakha (The Vale of Tears). Its set purpose in the introduction to the book was to serve as reading on the fast of 9 Av. There he dwells upon the sorrows and sufferings the Jews endured in various countries in the course of centuries. The book, which is a martyrology from beginning to end, closes with the 24th of Tammuz, 5335 AM (1575 CE). The tenor of the book makes it an out-spoken representative of \\"the lachrymose conception of Jewish history\\" (Salo Baron). Joseph ha-Kohen finished the first version of this work in 1558, at Voltaggio. Another version was finished in 1563, a third version ca 1565, and the fourth and final version in 1575. It circulated in Italy in manuscript and was edited for the first time by Samuel David Luzzatto and published in 1852 by Max Letteris. In 1858 M. Wiener published a German translation. A modern text- critical edition, edited by Karin Almbladh, appeared in 1981. Joseph ha-Kohen wrote also a Hebrew version, with the title Meqitz Nirdamim, of Me√Ør Alguadez's Spanish medical work giving prescriptions for the healing of various diseases; to these prescriptions he added some of his own.Comp.

In his world-chronicle there is a reference to Columbus (whom, however, he confounds with Amerigo Vespucci); the work is very meager in its information.Harrisse, in Centralblatt f√ºr Bibliothekswesen, 1888, p. 136 After writing it he became acquainted with Francisco L√≥pez de G√≥mara's Historia General de las Indias and Joan Boemus's Omnium Gentium Mores Leges et Ritus. From these, in 1557, he compiled his Matztib Gebulot 'Ammim (Who Setteth the Boundaries of Nations),See Deuteronomy xxxii.6 a history of the conquest of Mexico, to which he added a full account of the discoveries of Columbus. This work was published in 2002 by Moshe Lazar. A small work of a different kind was his Peles ha-Shemot, written in 1561, containing an alphabetical list of Hebrew nouns, with scripture illustrations of their occurrence given for the purpose of fixing their gender -- a matter in which (as he says) \\"many writers in Hebrew erred.\\" He also compiled, in 1567, a book of polite formulas to be used in addressing letters, and a large number of verses, which are found, written in his own hand, at the end of his works. A large number of letters, evidently meant to serve as models, are found in the MSS. Rabbinowicz, No. 129 (now in Budapest and edited by Abraham David in 1985). Two-thirds of these are by Joseph ha-Kohen; they give a good insight into his private life. Notes Bibliography * Karin Almbladh (ed.)

History Monarch Park Collegiate was the first high school built in Toronto after 1937. Construction of the school began in March 1965, and was completed by late August at a cost of $3,751,654.69. In 1966 a third storey was added at a cost of $1,245,210. The school that would later be known as College Francais was founded here in 1979, before moving to Jarvis Collegiate in 1981. Monarch Park Collegiate is an International Baccalaureate World School (2007). It presently offers the IB Prep program (Grades 9 and 10) and the IB Diploma Programme (Grades 11 and 12) which started in September 2008. The current head of the department is Jacqueline Allen. Overview Monarch Park Collegiate Institute offers a complete semestered program, open for extremely limited out-of-district student enrollment. Monarch Park Collegiate is a 'Global School' that embraces a philosophy on global education, focusing on human rights education, peace education, international development and environmentalism. The staff and students are from over 100 different countries and speak almost as many languages. Campus In terms of facilities, the large group instruction room was constructed to allow topics to be presented to approximately 150 and also greatly reduced repetition of the same material. The library, located in the same wing of the school, was constructed with a mezzanine which is capable of seating about 80 students. This mezzanine was constructed so that students could study and be in easy reach of the library's research books and other material. The auditorium, located in the same wing, was equipped with excellent lighting and acoustics system. The eastern wing was constructed with a modern swimming pool, measuring 75' √ó 35' and varying in depth from 3' to 9¬Ω' lined on one side by a gallery. In the summer of 2011 the pool area underwent renovations after being temporarily closed the year before. During the 2009-2010 school year NDP party leader Jack Layton visited the school during an effort to help keep it open to the students and public. On the southern end of the school property is Monarch Park stadium which has an artificial turf soccer field which can be transformed into a rugby, football or field hockey ground and also has a synthetic rubberized Olympic track. Monarch park stadium is operational every season of the year due to the dome put up during the colder months. Other The official mascot is the Monarch Park Lion to represent strength. The film The Virgin Suicides, directed by Sofia Coppola filmed on location throughout the school. Kenya Program This was a program in Canada, where Monarch Park Collegiate partnered with Toronto-based Free the Children (FTC). Thirteen students who were in the midst of studying courses on leadership, international development, human rights education and issues related to Africa and the developing world, traveled to Kenya In November 2006. There, for a month, students worked with the peoples of the Maasai Mara building schools, planting trees, and teaching English. Two years later, 13 Monarch Park students traveled to Kenya again, for 25 days. After returning to Toronto, students from both trips visited various schools within the GTA as Free the Children Ambassadors, telling their stories and urging students to get involved. Monarch Park has continued to be one of the top contributing high schools to FTC, and was featured in chapter 7 of the organization's book, Me to We.

Biography Born Horace Edward Carter Jr.Catalog of Copyright Entries: Third series, Library of Congress. Copyright Office, 1976, p. 137. in New York City to Horace Sr., an African- American longshoreman from Richmond, Virginia, and Carmen, who was from Trinidad, he is professionally known as steve carter (spelled in all lowercase letters). Carter's first interest in the theatre was to be a set designer. As a youngster, he would make models of sets inspired by motion pictures and the occasional play he would see with his mother. Soon he would populate these models with cutout figures. This led to him creating dialog for the figures as he moved them around the set. In 1948, he graduated from the High School of Music and Art in New York City. His professional career as a playwright began in 1965 at the American Community Theater with the production of the short play Terraced Apartment. This work would evolve years later into an expanded version entitled Terraces. On November 13, 1967, One Last Look premiered off- off-Broadway at the Old Reliable Theatre Tavern under the direction of Arthur French. It is a dark comedy set during the funeral of a family patriarch. It features the character of Eustace Baylor that would later be found in Eden, the first of Carter's trilogy of plays featuring Caribbean families in New York City. In 1968, he joined the staff of the Negro Ensemble Company (NEC), where he would become director of the NEC Playwrights Workshop. One of his best known students was Samm-Art Williams, who once said \\"that no single individual has influenced my writing to the degree that Steve Carter has.\\" While Carter was at NEC, several of his plays were produced, including the first two of his Caribbean trilogy. The Caribbean trilogy All three plays in the series deal with Caribbean immigrant families living in New York City at various periods during the 20th century. While each family is different, each play features a patriarch that has become incapacitated in one way or another. The plays in the trilogy are as follows: Eden Set in the San Juan Hill section of New York City in the late 1920s, Eden tells a story somewhat reminiscent of Romeo and Juliet about a young Caribbean woman who falls in love with a black man from the rural American South. Her strict father does not approve of the relationship, because he feels that American blacks, especially those from the rural South, are vastly inferior to Caribbean blacks. The play was produced by NEC in 1976, then transferred to Theatre de Lys to continue its run for a total of 181 performances. The production garnered Carter recognition from the Outer Critics Circle as the season's most promising new playwright. In 1986, his feature film adaptation, A Time Called Eden, was set to go into production, but has yet to be produced. Nevis Mountain Dew Nevis Mountain Dew, the second play in the series, deals with the effects of the patriarch being crippled by paralysis in the Queens section of New York City in the 1950s. Like Whose Life Is It Anyway?, it deals with euthanasia. Both were among the ten productions selected by the Burns Mantle Yearbook as \\"The Best Plays of 1978‚Äì1979.\\" Dame Lorraine In 1981, Carter left NEC to become the first playwright-in-residence at the Victory Gardens Theater in Chicago. His first play produced there was Dame Lorraine, the final play of his Caribbean trilogy. Set in modern times, the play tells the story of an elderly couple living in Harlem that anxiously await the return of their last surviving son who has just been released from prison. Later works Other plays produced at the Victory Gardens Theater include House of Shadows, Pecong and the musical, Shoot Me While I'm Happy. Spiele '36: Or the Fourth Medal had its world premiere at Theater of the First Amendment at George Mason University in 1991. Carter later lived in Houston, Texas, and died aged 90 on September 15, 2020 in Tomball, Texas.Nathaniel G.

During that time the firm built some one hundred steam locomotives for railroads throughout the United States. The Elephant, a wood-burning type 4-4-0 built by the company in 1849 for the Union Pacific Railroad, had the distinction of being the first locomotive to travel west of the Rocky Mountains. The unit was subsequently renamed the C.K.

It was released in the UK on 12 May 2003. The album was premiered at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall as part of the Celtic Connections Festival in January 2003 and on release garnered Reader some of the best reviews of her career. Reader explained how the album came about in the extensive liner notes, how when her family was relocated to the Ayrshire town of Irvine (Burns was from Ayrshire), how it \\"saved my life to be introduced to an alternative Scottish beauty and language... I often thought Robert Burns was for the highbrow and not the likes of me, the hardly educated, council estate, overspill girl. Now I see that I was wrong and that I am precisely the person Burns wrote for.\\" Reader says she has discovered in Robert Burns something she believes has been overlooked in the approach to his work, and she believes that her interpretations of his poetry will reach more ears than have previously heard him. She explains: \\"I sang My Love's Like a Red, Red Rose to a bunch of 'worse for the drink' people in a bar in Glasgow one cold January night and I felt something happening between me and the words and the people listening, something profoundly moving. After all my travels singing songs to people, I recognised this as being a vein of emotional gold as yet unmined ... I began to be spooked by him and started on a journey to find him, Robert, the guy from Ayrshire that I would have drunk with, walked with and probably got into trouble with.

The final ice crystal concentration changes from 10% to 50%. It dispenses on a type of soft drink and a trade mark of each company producing FCB. Some common FCBs are the Slurpee, the ICEE, and the Froster. History The FCB machine was invented by Omar Knedlik, then the owner of a Dairy Queen franchise. In the late 1950s, his restaurant lacked a soda fountain. Instead, he stored soda in his freezer. His customers loved the slushy drinks, so Knedlik tried to capture them with a machine. By the mid 1960s, about 300 machines had been manufactured. In 1965 7-Eleven licensed the machine, and began selling the Slurpee. Operation The back-end of an FCB machine is very similar to a regular soda fountain. Concentrated flavor syrups are mixed with filtered water, then carbonated. This mixture is then injected into a cylinder surrounded by freezer coils. The mixture freezes to the wall of the cylinder, then is scraped off by a rotating dasher, which also keeps the mixture uniformly mixed. FCB machines will often freeze to a temperature well below the freezing point of water, but the combination of pressure (up to 40 p.s.i.), sugar, the carbon dioxide mixture (carbonic acid freezes at -80 ¬∞C), and the constant stirring prevent the mass from freezing solid. Differences between FCBs and other drinks FCB machines are distinctive from other slush drink machines in that they require a pressure chamber and a carbon dioxide source. Many modern non-carbonated slush machines use a spiral- shaped plastic dasher to scrape crystals off a freezing cylinder, often integrated into a clear hopper. This product is often much 'wetter' than a true FCB. On the other hand, non-carbonated machines are much simpler and less expensive, and so they are more common. A non-carbonated slush machine can be purchased for well under $2000, and rented for less than $100/day or from ¬£65.00 per day in the UK for a single head machine. By comparison, FCB machines often must have a dedicated service staff.

He was Wolverhampton Wanderers' first-choice keeper for much of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Career Nicknamed \\"Lofty\\" for his booming kicks upfield, Parkes joined Wolves in 1962 straight from school and turned professional two years later. After several years in the reserve league, he made his first-team debut on 19 November 1966, saving a penalty in a 3‚Äì2 win over Preston North End. For the following nine seasons, Parkes missed few Wolves games and ‚Äî over the 1971‚Äì72 and 1972‚Äì73 seasons ‚Äî appeared in 127 consecutive league matches, breaking Noel George's club record. In 1967, Parkes accompanied Wolves as they went to the United States to perform as Los Angeles Wolves in the United Soccer Association, a professional league that imported teams to represent American cities and which, a year later, would merge with a rival league to form the North American Soccer League. Parkes anchored the team as it proceeded to win the USA title, defeating Washington Whips (represented by Aberdeen) in the final. Parkes would return to the United States two years later, in a similar \\"guest\\" role, as Wolves represented Kansas City Spurs in the NASL's 1969 \\"mini- season.\\" The keeper won a UEFA Cup runners-up medal in 1972, after saving two penalties in the semi-final tie with Ferencv√°ros to help the club to the final. However, he missed out on a winners medal in the League Cup, when he broke an ankle in the run-up to the 1974 final,\\"Proud day tinged for Wolves hero\\" ExpressAndStar.com, 28 February 2009 (Retrieved: 25 July 2009) after having played in all the previous rounds. He traded the goalkeeper's role with Gary Pierce over the next two seasons, until Pierce made the spot his own as Wolves won the Second Division championship in 1976‚Äì77. Nonetheless, Parkes stayed on the books at Molineux until 1978. With opportunities limited at Wolves, the goalkeeper had returned to North America to play in the North American Soccer League, with the Vancouver Whitecaps in the summers. He served the Canadian club in 1976, 1977 and 1979, the latter seeing him win the Soccer Bowl. He was also voted the league's top goalkeeper for 1977 and 1979, after keeping teammate Bruce Grobbelaar out of the side. He moved on to the Chicago Sting for 1980 and part of 1981, before joining the San Jose Earthquakes for the remainder of the 1981 season.

Anastomoses between arteries and between veins result in a multitude of arteries and veins, respectively, serving the same volume of tissue. Such anastomoses occur normally in the body in the circulatory system, serving as backup routes for blood to flow if one link is blocked or otherwise compromised, but may also occur pathologically. Physiologic Arterio- arterial anastomoses include actual (e.g., palmar and plantar arches) and potential varieties (e.g., coronary arteries and cortical branch of cerebral arteries). There are many examples of normal arterio-arterial anastomoses in the body. Clinically important examples include: *Circle of Willis (in the brain) *Coronary: anterior interventricular artery and posterior interventricular artery of the heart *Scapular anastomosis (for the subclavian vessels) *Joint anastomoses: Almost all joints receive anastomotic blood supply from more than one source. **Shoulder (and circumflex humeral) **Elbow (see blood supply of elbow) **Hip (and circumflex iliac; see also cruciate anastomosis) **Knee (and genicular arteries; see also patellar network) **Ankle *Abdominal anastomoses **Marginal artery of the colon *Pelvic anastomoses *Hand - palmar arches: superficial palmar arch and deep palmar arch *Foot - plantar arch Coronary Surgical intervention Coronary anastomoses are a clinically vital subject: the coronary anastomosis is the blood supply to the heart. The coronary arteries are vulnerable to arteriosclerosis and other effects. Inadequate supply to the heart will lead to chest pains (angina) or a heart attack (myocardial infarction). These can be ameliorated by surgical intervention to create a bypass using the anastomosis technique. Creation of an end-to-end anastomosis is a basic microsurgical skill that is taught to surgical residents and fellows. Akelina Y. Microsurgical technique for 1mm vessel end to end anastomosis. J Med Ins. 2014;2014(2). doi:https://doi.org/10.24296/jomi/2 Naturally occurring Coronary anastomoses are anatomically present though functionally obsolete. There was some suggestion that they may be helpful if a problem develops slowly over time (this will need to be verified) but in the case of the pathogenesis of CHD they do not provide a sufficient blood flow to prevent infarction. There are anastomoses between the Circumflex and right coronary arteries and between the anterior and posterior inter-ventricular arteries. In the normal heart these anastomoses are non-functional. Arterio-venous Superficial arterio-venous anastomoses open when the body reaches a high temperature, and enable the body to cool itself. As warm arterial blood passes close to the surface it will decrease in temperature. This occurs together with sweating. Pathologic Pathological anastomoses result from trauma or disease and may involve veins, arteries, or intestines. These are usually referred to as fistulas. In the cases of veins or arteries, traumatic fistulas usually occur between artery and vein. Traumatic intestinal fistulas usually occur between two loops of intestine (entero-enteric fistula) or intestine and skin (enterocutaneous fistula). Portacaval anastomosis, by contrast, is a veno-venous anastomosis between a vein of the portal circulation and a vein of the systemic circulation, which allows blood to bypass the liver in patients with portal hypertension, often resulting in hemorrhoids, esophageal varices, or caput medusae. Circulatory anastomoses between monochorionic twins may result in twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome.

The metal frame of a piano, often called the plate or harp, anchors both ends of the strings, withstanding a tension of 20 tons or more. The first completely metal frames were patented in the mid-1820s, and they are now generally cast in iron. The similar strength of aluminum and cast iron permitted the weight of the cast metal frame to be reduced more than 60 percent, to as little as 45 pounds for a spinet. In 1945 Alcoa signed an agreement with Winter and Company to manufacture aluminum piano plates and began to market their new creation. Many of Alcoa‚Äôs ads can be seen in Etude, a magazine for the musician and pianist, in 1949 and 1950. The typical ad campaign boasted the slogan ‚Äústop‚Ä¶lift‚Ä¶listen,‚Äù which was asking consumers to stop, feel the light weight of the new piano, and listen to the quality of sound. A brochure, circulated by Alcoa, claimed that some 50,000 pianos had been created containing this aluminum plate by 1949. After 1950, however, the aluminum piano plate was no longer used by piano manufacturers. Other aluminum instruments As soon as aluminum was available in the late nineteenth century, people began experimenting with making new or improved musical instruments, but it was not until the 1930s that companies began to consider mass-producing them. At that time Joseph E. Maddy, founder of the Interlochen School of Music, (now the Interlochen Center for the Arts), requested that Alcoa experiment with manufacturing an aluminum violin and string bass. As a band director, Maddy was looking for durability in musical instruments. He wanted an instrument that could handle the abuse it received from his students as well as from atmospheric changes, since many of his rehearsals were conducted outside. These instruments, however, were not popular, and Maddy‚Äôs business venture did not flourish. Other products using aluminum were manufactured in the 1930s including Laurens Hammond‚Äôs electric organ created in 1935. Some instruments were more successful than others, such as the vibraphone or vibraharp. The vibraphone, a percussion instrument consisting of a series of bars with tubes below to help resonate the sound, was created in 1921 by the Leedy Manufacturing Company. It got its name from the vibrating fans below the bars that could be turned on an off electronically, giving the instrument a vibrato effect. The Vibraharp, created in 1928 by J.C. Deagan, is the same instrument, but created out of aluminum instead of wood or steel. Due to its success, Leedy began manufacturing their vibraphones with aluminum in 1929, and they are still made of aluminum today. In the mid-1930s, the Bl√ºthner piano company built a lightweight aluminum alloy piano for the airship Hindenburg.

Next it was hired to perform at the St. Francis Hotel. Popularity allowed Hickman to expand his sextet and hire Ben Black, Earl Burtnett, Fred Coffman, Clyde Doerr, Steve Douglas, Frank Ellis, Dick Noolan, Ed Fitzpatrick, Jess Fitzpatrick, Roy Fox, Ray Hoback, Vic King, Lou Marcasie, Hank Miller, Mark Moica, Bert Ralton, Juan Ramos, Forrest Ray, Walt Rosener, Bela Spiller, Dick Winfree. In 1915, they performed at the world's fair in San Francisco. Four years later they were hired by Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. to play at his nightclub on the roof of the New Amsterdam Theatre in New York City. During the next year, they accompanied the Ziegfeld Follies. Hickman's orchestra went back to California and played again at the St. Francis Hotel and the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. After Hickman retired, the band was led by Frank Ellis. Hickman's \\"Rose Room\\" became a big band standard. Influence Art Hickman and His Orchestra, c. 1919 Before Paul Whiteman, Hickman's dance orchestra was one of the first to use elements of jazz and one of the first to use a saxophone section. The bands instruments also included violin, trumpet, trombone, reeds (2), banjo (2), double bass, and piano, with Hickman on second piano and drums. Jelly Roll Morton disputed the notion that Hickman's orchestra was one of the first big bands.

This simple, two-dimensional measure of solvent exposure counts the number of neighbors in two domes (with radius R typically equal to 10 or 12 √Ö) around the CŒ± atom. It is simple and extremely fast to compute, and superior to the widely used Contact Number measure. The HSE value pair (up and down) of the example above is (3,5). Half Sphere Exposure (HSE) is a protein solvent exposure measure that was first introduced by .. Like all solvent exposure measures it measures how buried amino acid residues are in a protein. It is found by counting the number of amino acid neighbors within two half spheres of chosen radius around the amino acid. The calculation of HSE is found by dividing a contact number (CN) sphere in two halves by the plane perpendicular to the CŒ≤-CŒ± vector. This simple division of the CN sphere results in two strikingly different measures, HSE-up and HSE- down. HSE-up is defined as the number of CŒ± atoms in the upper half (containing the pseudo-CŒ≤ atom) and analogously HSE-down is defined as the number of CŒ± atoms in the opposite sphere. If only CŒ± atoms are available (as is the case for many simplified representations of protein structure), a related measure, called HSEŒ±, can be used. HSEŒ± uses a pseudo-CŒ≤ instead of the real CŒ≤ atom for its calculation. The position of this pseudo-CŒ≤ atom (pCŒ≤) is derived from the positions of preceding CŒ±‚àí1 and the following CŒ±+1. The CŒ±-pCŒ≤ vector is calculated by adding the CŒ±‚àí1-CŒ±0 and CŒ±+1-CŒ±0 vectors. HSE is used in predicting discontinuous B-cell epitopes.. Song et al. have developed an online webserver termed HSEpred to predict half-sphere exposure from protein primary sequences.. HSEpred server can achieve the correlation coefficients of 0.72 and 0.68 between the predicted and observed HSE-up and HSE-down measures, respectively, when evaluated on a well-prepared non- homologous protein structure dataset. Moreover, residue contact number (CN) can also be accurately predicted by HSEpred webserver using the summation of the predicted HSE-up and HSE-down values, which has further enlarged the application of this new solvent exposure measure. Recently, Heffernan et al. has developed the most accurate predictor for both HSEŒ± and HSEŒ≤ based on a big dataset by using multiple-step iterative deep neural-network learning. The predicted HSEa shows a higher correlation coefficient to the stability change by residue mutants than predicted HSEŒ≤ and ASA. The results, together with its easy Ca-atom-based calculation, highlight the potential usefulness of predicted HSEa for protein structure prediction and refinement as well as function prediction.

The term is most often used to refer to Canadians who either migrated from or have ancestry from the United States. Demography According to the 2016 Census, 377,410 Canadians reported American as being their ethnicity, at least partially. There has not been a reliable estimate of the total number of Americans from the United States who have settled in Canada since the founding of the two countries as the United States in 1776 and Canada in 1867. Prior to the independence of the United States and the formation of Canada, the settled areas were British colonies. Many American Canadians chose to live in major cities such as Toronto and other urban areas of southern Ontario, such as Windsor, facing Detroit, and Niagara Falls, Ontario, across from Niagara Falls, New York, in the Buffalo area. Vancouver; Osoyoos, British Columbia; Edmonton, Alberta; and Calgary, Alberta, also have American expatriate colonies. History of Americans in Canada Americans have moved to Canada throughout history. During the American Revolution, many white Americans, 15-25% of the population (300-500,000), loyal to the British crown left the United States and settled in Canada. By 1783, 46,000 had settled in Ontario (10,000) and the Maritimes (36,000). These early settlers were officially designated United Empire Loyalists and referred to as the King's Loyal Americans. Many Black Canadians are descendants of African American slaves (Black Loyalists) who fled to Canada during the American Revolution. Similar waves of American immigrants, 30,000, lured by promises of land if they swore a loyalty oath to the King, settled in Ontario before the War of 1812. The Black Refugees in the War of 1812 also fled to Canada and many American slaves also came via the Underground Railroad, most settling in either Halifax, Nova Scotia or Southern Ontario. At the outbreak of the war of 1812 80,000 of 110,000 inhabitants in Ontario were American born or descendants of Americans. In the Maritimes 110,000 of 135,000 were Americans who settled before 1775 or after and their descendants. This fact gave English-speaking Canada a pronounced American cultural flavor into the 1830s. The difference was political: those who disliked the split with Britain and those who supported it. In the early 20th century, over 750,000 American settlers moved into the farming regions of the Prairie Provinces of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Many of these were immigrants (or children of immigrants) from Europe or Eastern Canada who had gone to the United States looking for farm land only to find the supply of free farmsteads there exhausted. Others were old-stock European Americans, and a small percentage were racial minorities, such as African Americans. In 1916, Americans accounted for 36% of all the foreign-born residents of Alberta, 30% in Saskatchewan, and 8% in Manitoba. or about 400,000 in a total population of the three provinces close to 1.5 million. Not all stayed. In the 1930s, before World War II, and again in the 1970s, waves of Americans, many from Texas and Oklahoma, migrated to Canada to work in the country's growing oil industry. During the Vietnam War era, many American draft dodgers fled to Canada to avoid the war. About 10,200 Americans moved to Canada in 2006; this was the highest number since 1977.

He served as Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies under Lord Salisbury from 1885 to 1886 and 1886 to 1887. He also successfully presided over the 1902 Land Conference and was the founder of the Irish Reform Association. He recruited two regiments of sharpshooters, leading them in the Boer War and later establishing a unit in Ireland. A big game hunter, in 1874 Dunraven claimed 15,000 acres in Colorado, United States, determined to make the area a game park. He built a tourist hotel there but sold the land in the early 20th century, as he was under continuous pressure from settlers trying to encroach on his holdings. Background, education and early life Lord Dunraven was the son of The 3rd Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl by his first wife, Florence Augusta Goold, third daughter of Thomas Goold. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford. After serving as a lieutenant in the 1st Life Guards, a cavalry regiment, Dunraven became, at age twenty-six, a war correspondent for the London newspaper The Daily Telegraph. He covered the Abyssinian War in Africa. In this capacity, he shared a tent with Henry Stanley of The New York Herald. Dunraven became a special correspondent for a \\"big London daily\\" during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870‚Äì71. He reported the Siege of Paris, saw the Third Carlist War and war in Turkey, and probably the Russo-Turkish War. Dunraven witnessed both the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, which ended the Franco-Prussian War in 1871, and later the signing of the Treaty of Versailles to end the Great War in 1919.

Retired from 1st Guards 1 February 1867. He was a lieutenant in the Gloucestershire Yeomanry Cavalry and resigned his Commission on 9 June 1875. He was appointed Honorary Colonel of the Glamorgan Artillery (Western Division) Royal Artillery on 17 April 1895. He was appointed to the Honorary Colonelcy of the 5th Battalion, the Royal Munster Fusiliers, on 25 August 1897. Boer War and the Sharpshoooters During the early stages of the South African War 1899-1902, the British Army suffered defeats at the hands of the Boer Commandos, composed of men who were first-class shots and good horsemen. The effect in the United Kingdom was to inspire a rush of volunteers. The Earl of Dunraven formed a committee in Dec 1899 to raise a squadron of 'Sharpshooters' from those volunteers who could both ride and shoot well. By March 1900, a full battalion (18th Bn Imperial Yeomanry) had been raised. On 6 April 1900, Dunraven's Sharpshooters started for South Africa. Lord Dunraven at the last moment decided to accompany the force and was posted as a supernumerary captain on the battalion staff. He was gazetted on 17 April 1900 to be Captain (Supernumerary) of the 18th Battalion of the Imperial Yeomanry, with the temporary rank of Captain in the Army, from 18 April 1900, which he relinquished in July 1901. He was mentioned in despatches (29 November 1900) by Lord Roberts, Commander-in-Chief during the early part of the war. In January 1901, the government made a further call for yeomanry and between February and March, another 1,200 men were recruited by the Sharpshooters Committee. They were formed into two battalions, the 21st and 23rd. The Sharpshooters fought many small-scale actions against the Boers, with increasing skill, and showed the value of mobile, well-armed and resourceful troops. Following their success, Lord Dunraven was given permission to raise a regiment for service at home. On 23 July 1901, the 3rd County of London (Sharpshooters) Imperial Yeomanry was formally organized. On 25 March 1902 Dunraven resigned his commission and received a new commission, subject to the provisions of the Militia and Yeomanry Act, 1901, retaining his rank and seniority as Lieutenant-Colonel (Honorary Captain in the Army). In the November 1902 Birthday Honours list he was appointed a Companion of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George (CMG) for his service in South Africa. On 22 November 1903, Major-General Baden-Powell, Inspector of Cavalry, unveiled a memorial in the Church of St Martin's in the Fields. About 400 men of all ranks of 3CLY under the command of Colonel Lord Dunraven attended the ceremony. On 6 August 1904 he was appointed to the Honorary Colonelcy of the Regiment. In 1904 the Regiment's first battle honour South Africa 1900-02 was awarded. Political career Dunraven succeeded his father in the earldom in 1871 and took his seat in the House of Lords. He served as Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies under Lord Salisbury from 1885 to 1886 and again from 1886 to 1887. During 1888 to 1890 he was chairman of the Commission on Sweated Labour. As a constructive moderate Unionist he sought to bring about a peaceful solution to the Irish land question and to the demand for Home Rule. In 1897 he published The Outlook in Ireland, the case for Devolution and Conciliation which was reprinted in 1907. Dunraven was an inaugural member of Glamorgan County Council, representing Bridgend as a Conservative between 1889 and 1892. He also sat as Moderate Party councillor representing Wandsworth on the London County Council from 1895‚Äì99. Dunraven was the owner of the Adare Manor estate at Adare, County Limerick. Following the initiative of George Wyndham, the Chief Secretary for Ireland, he was instrumental in forming the 1902 Land Conference of which he was chairman, representing the landlord side. Together with William O'Brien, who represented the tenant side, the conference resulted in the publication of a unanimous report in January which led to the enactment of the Wyndham Land (Purchase) Act (1903). This terminated the last vestige of absentee landlordism in Ireland and enabled tenants to purchase land from their landlords under favourable financial provisions. After presiding over the Land Conference, Lord Dunraven founded the Irish Reform Association. While reflecting primarily the views of progressive landlords like him, it was intended to rally all those who wished to see the 'conference policy' applied to other spheres of Irish life. In the course of 1904, this body produced a scheme of \\"devolution\\"‚Äîthat is, for granting to Ireland limited powers of local self-government. The Under-Secretary for Ireland, Sir Antony MacDonnell, had a hand in drafting it.Lyons, F. S. L.: John Dillon, Ch. 10, p. 273-4, Routledge & Kegan Paul, London (1968), SBN 7100 2887 3 It was greeted at first as a significant step towards self-government, while not Home Rule. Such a policy failed to gain sufficient nationalist support, the new proposals dismissed by John Dillon. Unionists responded by forming the Ulster Unionist Council in 1905. For Dillon, devolution was not enough; for the alarmed Ulster Unionists, it was a Trojan Horse for Home Rule.Bew, Paul: Ireland: The Politics of Enmity 1789-2006, p.363, Oxford University Press (2007), In the end, the controversy resulted in Chief Secretary George Wyndham being driven in ignominy from office.Lyons p. 272 Dunraven was also a member of the Order of Saint Patrick. On the foundation of the Irish Free State, he became a member of the first Senate in December 1922 and served until his resignation in January 1926. He was nominated to the Senate by the President of the Executive Council, W. T. Cosgrave, as part of assurances during the 1921 negotiation of the Anglo-Irish Treaty given by Arthur Griffith to southern unionists and the British government that unionists would have adequate representation in the new parliament to safeguard their interests. Colorado huntsman Albert Bierstadt was commissioned by the Earl of Dunraven to make a painting of the Estes Park and Longs Peak area in 1876 for $15,000. The painting, originally displayed in Dunraven Castle, is now in the collection of the Denver Art Museum. Lord Dunraven spent much of his leisure time hunting wild game in various parts of the world. After hearing of the fine hunting in the American West, he decided to visit. He first arrived in 1872, and met and befriended Texas Jack Omohundro, who acted as a guide and led the earl's party on buffalo and elk hunts.Earl of Dunraven, Hunting in the Yellowstone or On the Trail of the Wapiti with Texas Jack in the Land of Geysers, The Macmillan Company, 1925 Reuniting with Texas Jack on his second visit to the American west in 1874, he explored Yellowstone Park. This trip would be documented in his book Hunting in the Yellowstone or On the Trail of the Wapiti with Texas Jack in the Land of Geysers. Later on the same trip, the young earl decided to make the whole of Estes Park, Colorado into a game preserve for the exclusive use of himself and his British and Irish friends. By stretching the provisions of the Homestead Act and pre-emption rights, Dunraven claimed 15,000 acres (61 km2) in what later was designated as the present-day Rocky Mountain National Park. His efforts resulted in what has been called \\"one of the most gigantic land steals in the history of Colorado\\". The coming of more settlers in 1874 and 1875 stopped this wholesale appropriation of land. In 1876, the earl commissioned Albert Bierstadt to make a painting on canvas of Longs Peak and Estes Park for US $15,000, . He intended to hang it in Dunraven Castle. Bierstadt traveled with Theodore Whyte, the earl's associate, to the area and visited locations to make sketches and paintings; Whyte was also working to identify a site for an English hotel for the Earl. The completed painting is now held in the Denver Public Library's art collection. Although for 33 years Dunraven considered the Park his personal property, the settlers did not. Their hostility forced him to give up the game preserve idea. Dunraven later described the influx of settlers and his consequent plans: Tourist enterprise Ape published in Vanity Fair in 1878. Bierstadt, commissioned by Dunraven to paint at Estes Park, also helped select the site for Dunraven's 'English Hotel,' which was built in 1877. It was situated in a meadow east of the present Estes Park village, and was the first strictly tourist hotel built in the Park. The hotel was a three-story, timber-frame building. It had twelve narrow windows, and a large door opening onto a one-storied, columned porch. The roof of this porch formed an open deck surrounded by a small hand railing. The porch ran the full length of the front of the building and about halfway around each end. Despite the success of this 'English Hotel and Lodge,' the disillusioned Dunraven left the area forever in the late 1880s. He later said: Dunraven realised it would be impossible for him to control all of the park region; in 1907 he sold his property to B. D. Sanborn of Greeley, Colorado and F. O. Stanley of Newton, Massachusetts. Stanley later built the historic Stanley Hotel in Estes Park. Dunraven's wooden 'English Hotel' burned to the ground in 1911. Sportsman Valkyrie I Lord Dunraven maintained an equestrian stud farm on his Adare Manor estate. He experimented in growing tobacco until his factory was burned down in 1916.A Dictionary of Irish History since 1800, D. J. Hickey & J. E. Doherty, Gill & MacMillan (1980) A keen yachtsman, the earl was the owner and co-owner of the 1893 and 1895 America's Cup yachts Valkyrie II and Valkyrie III. On returning home in 1896 from Newport, Rhode Island, Dunraven alleged cheating by the winning American yacht, Defender. As a sportsman, he wrote Canadian Nights about \\"life and sports in the Rockies\\". Family and personal life Headstone Lord Dunraven married Florence Kerr, second daughter of Lord Charles Kerr. The latter was the first son of The 6th Marquess of Lothian by his second wife. The Dunravens had three children: *Lady Florence Enid Wyndham-Quin (13 June 1870 ‚Äì July 1891). *Lady Rachael Charlotte Wyndham-Quin (20 February 1872 ‚Äì 30 January 1901), married Desmond FitzJohn Lloyd FitzGerald, 27th Knight of Glin and had children. *Lady Aileen May Wyndham- Quin (9 April 1873 ‚Äì 25 February 1962), married Lord Ardee, who later became, in 1929, The 13th Earl of Meath, and had children. In 1897, she was one of the guests at the Duchess of Devonshire's Diamond Jubilee Costume Ball. In 1869, Lord Dunraven revealed in his diaries, under the title Experiences in Spiritualism with D. D. Home, that he had slept in the same bed with Daniel Dunglas Home. Many of the diary entries contain erotic homosexual references between Home and the then Lord Adare.Barry H. Wiley. The Thought Reader Craze: Victorian Science at the Enchanted Boundary. McFarland. p. 24. From 1900 onwards Lord Dunraven developed the gardens on \\"Garinish Island\\" (near Sneem, County Kerry, Republic of Ireland), which he had inherited from his father, The 3rd Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl, into a subtropical wild garden. It is still in existence today. The house, called \\"Garinish Lodge\\", was burned in September 1922 during the Irish Civil War (1922‚Äì1923), but later rebuilt. Lord Dunraven died in June 1926, aged 85. As he died without a male heir, the earldom passed to a cousin, Windham Wyndham-Quin, 5th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl. The barony of Kenry, which had been created for his father, became extinct. He left all his unsettled property (acquired during his lifetime), including Garinish Island, his yacht and racehorses to his only surviving child, Aileen. All the settled property, which included Adare Manor and other properties there, as well as Dunraven Castle estate and several valuable coal mines in South Wales, was left to his successor, his cousin. Dunraven was buried at St. Nicholas' Church of Ireland in Adare, County Limerick, Ireland. In 1895 Dunraven had lived at 27 Norfolk Street. Legacy and honours In 1939, 13 years after his death, Norfolk Street (London, Mayfair, United Kingdom) was renamed as Dunraven Street in his honour. Dunraven Pass on the Grand Loop Road between Tower and Canyon in Yellowstone National Park is named after Lord Dunraven, as is nearby Dunraven Peak, a 9,869 feet (3,008 m) mountain peak in the Washburn Range.

Warne-Smith remained involved with the club for the rest of his life and was named in the Melbourne Football Club Team of the Century. He was also named in the Tasmanian Team of the Century. Warne-Smith fought in both World War I and World War II. Early life Warne-Smith was born in Sydney and moved to Melbourne with his family when he was a child. He was educated at Wesley College, where he was noted as a footballer and cricketer.Australian Dictionary of Biography, available online here In 1914 he received \\"triple honour colours\\" at Wesley, for showing \\"exceptional commitment to the team and an outstanding level of skill in the specific sport\\" in three separate sports.\\"A Brief History of Wesley College Sport\\" Wesley College.

More than two years below enlistment age, he pretended to be 18, as did many other Australians. He served at Gallipoli and on the Western Front. Two of his three brothers were killed in the war. Football career Victorian Football League On returning to Melbourne in 1919 Warne-Smith joined the Melbourne Football Club, in the VFL and played eight games at centre halfback in that season. North-Western Football Union In 1920 he moved to Latrobe in Tasmania, where he became an orchardist. From 1920 to 1924 he played with the Latrobe Diehards football club in the Tasmanian North-Western Football Union (NWFU), and was captain-coach from 1922 onwards. Latrobe were premiers in 1922 and 1924 and runners up in 1923. In 1923 and 1924 he was runner-up in the NWFU's Cheel Medal for the best and fairest player. He was captain of the NWFU representative team in statewide competition, and was selected to play for Tasmania in the 1924 national carnival, although he was unable to play. Back to the VFL By 1924 Warne-Smith had such a reputation that Victorian teams were keen to bring him back to Melbourne, despite the fact that he was 27. In 1925 he returned to the Melbourne club, where he played a further 146 games, usually in the backline. He was also a talented ruckman and could play in the centre or forward line if required. Under his leadership Melbourne won the premiership in 1926, the club's first since 1900. In 1926 Warne-Smith won his first Brownlow Medal and his second in 1928. From 1928 to 1931 he was captain and coach. He played for Victoria against other state sides from 1926 to 1929, and was captain of the state team in 1928 and 1929. He retired as a player at the end of 1931, coached the club in 1932 and played in several games that season when other players were unavailable. Life after football After retiring from football Warne-Smith became a regular football writer for the Melbourne Argus newspaper and worked as an executive with the Vacuum Oil Company (later absorbed by Mobil). WWII On the outbreak of World War II, he rejoined the Army (having been initially rejected on the grounds that he was too old at 43). He served with the Royal Australian Army Service Corps, in charge of fuel supplies, in the Middle East, the Northern Territory, New Guinea and Borneo. For his leadership during the Borneo operations, he was mentioned in dispatches. He was demobilised in October 1945. Chairman of selectors In 1949 Warne-Smith became chairman of selectors for the Melbourne Football Club, a post he held until his death. He was also elected to the committee of the Melbourne Cricket Club, which at this time controlled the Melbourne Football Club. These were the most successful years in Melbourne's history. Under coach Norm Smith Melbourne won premierships in 1955, 1956, 1957 and 1959. Warne-Smith was Smith's closest advisor and was regarded as the club's elder statesman, becoming a life member in 1952. He retired due to ill health in 1959. Death Warne-Smith died of heart disease in 1960. Legacy Warne-Smith won the Brownlow Medal twice: in 1926, and again in 1928.

Apse. Santa Donna Regina Vecchia is a church in Naples, in southern Italy. It is called Vecchia (\\"old\\") to distinguish it from the newer and adjacent church of Santa Maria Donna Regina Nuova. The earliest mention of a church on this site is from the year 780 in a reference to the nuns of the church of San Pietro del Monte di Donna Regina. At that time, the church was quite near the old eastern city wall. The nuns were of the Basilian order and, when that order left Naples in the beginning of the 9th century, took Benedictine vows. In 1264, Pope Gregory IX gave the nuns permission to join the Franciscan order. In 1293 a severe earthquake caused great damage to the original structure, and queen Mary of Hungary, consort of the king of Naples, Charles II of Anjou financed the construction of a new complex adjacent to the old one. The newer complex is known as Santa Maria Donna Regina Nuova.All information is from Overview Like San Lorenzo Maggiore, the other Franciscan foundation in Naples, Donna Regina is built in the Italian variant of the French Gothic style favored by the mendicant orders in the 13th and 14th century, with pointed arches, window tracery, and a faceted apse, all surmounted by a trussed, wooden roof. In the left nave aisle is the tomb of Mary of Hungary, commissioned by her son, Robert I of Anjou, after her death on 25 March 1323. The elaborate Gothic monument is the work of Sienese sculptor and stonemason Tino da Camaino and an unknown Neapolitan artist. Tino worked for the Angevin court between 1324 and his death in 1337; the tomb presumably dates from the mid-1320s. In its structure and sculptural program, Mary's tomb resembles Tino's funerary monuments in Tuscany. Angels draw back curtains to reveal the gisant figure of the Queen, who is clad in the habit of a Poor Clare, or Franciscan nun, recalling her long-standing financial support of the convent and underscoring her efforts to emulate mendicant spirituality in general. The niche figures on the sarcophagus represent Mary's sons Charles Martel, Louis of Toulouse and Robert himself. Also notable are the 14th-century frescoes by Pietro Cavallini (along with his workshop, or some of his followers) and Filippo Rusuti, one of the most important pieces of paintings from that century in Naples. They were executed between 1307 and 1320 and depict, on two levels, stories of life of Christ and the Apostles. In the lower level are 17 episodes of Jesus, 5 of St. Elizabeth and four of St. Clare, paired to a Last Judgement, the latter certainly attributable to Cavallini. In the upper one are six scenes of St. Agnes. From the same period, but by unknown artists, are the Crucifixion frescoes on the left wall and the Annunciation on the wall facing the entrance. The triumphal arch of the apse has two frescoes with the Crucifixion; the apse has remains of majolica-covered pavement from a Neapolitan workshop of the Angevin era (late 14th-early 15th century). Also present is a Martyrdom of St. Ursula attributed to Francesco da Tolentino (1520).

He was styled Viscount Adare from 1824 to 1850. The son of Windham Quin, 2nd Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl, he succeeded to the Earldom on the death of his father in 1850. Along with George Petrie, Lord Dunraven is credited with \\"laying the foundations of a sound school of archaeology\\" in Ireland. Family The third Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl in the peerage of Ireland, and first Baron Kenry of the United Kingdom (1812‚Äì1871), born 19 May 1812, in London, was only son of Windham Henry, second earl. His grandfather, Valentine Richard Quin (1752‚Äì1824), as a staunch supporter of the union, was recommended by Lord Cornwallis for a peerage, with the title of Baron Adare (31 July 1800) (Cornwallis Correspondence, ed. Ross, iii. 25). He was further created Viscount Mount-Earl in 1816, and Earl of Dunraven in 1822. Wyndham-Quin was educated at Eton and at Trinity College, Dublin, graduating BA in 1833. He converted to Roman Catholicism in 1855. The third earl's father, Windham Henry Quin, second earl of Dunraven (1782‚Äì1850), assumed in 1815 the additional name of Wyndham in right of his wife. He represented Limerick county in the imperial parliament from 1806 to 1820, and was a representative peer of Ireland from 1839 till his death. The third earl's mother, Caroline, was daughter and heiress of Thomas Wyndham of Dunraven Castle, Glamorganshire. She inherited from her father property in Gloucestershire, as well as the Wyndham estate in Glamorganshire; she died on 26 May 1870. Parliamentary and public service As Viscount Adare, he sat as the Conservative MP for Glamorganshire from the General Election in July 1837 to 1851. While in the House of Commons he became a supporter of Catholicism. His political activity largely aimed at safeguarding religious education in Ireland (Hansard, 3rd ser. lxxx. 1142‚Äì3). He became subsequently one of the commissioners of education in Ireland. He succeeded his father as third earl in the Irish peerage in 1850, and retired from the House of Commons next year. On 12 March 1866 he was named a knight of St. Patrick, and on 11 June of the same year was created a peer of the United Kingdom, with the title of Baron Kenry, of Kenry, County Limerick. He acted as lord lieutenant of County Limerick from 1864 till his death. Academic pursuits Dunraven was deeply interested in intellectual pursuits. For three years he studied astronomy under William Rowan Hamilton in the Dublin observatory, and acquired a thorough knowledge both of the practical and theoretical sides of the science. He investigated the phenomena of spiritualism, and convinced himself of their genuineness. His son, later, the fourth earl, prepared for him minute reports of s√©ances which Daniel Dunglas Home conducted with his aid in 1867‚Äì8. The reports were privately printed as Experiences in Spiritualism with Mr. D. D. Home, with a lucid introduction by Dunraven, in 1869 and subsequently withdrawn. Dunraven's chief interest was in archaeology. He was associated with George Petrie, Stokes, and other Irish arch√¶ologists in the foundation of the Irish Archaeological Society in 1840, and of the Celtic Society in 1845. In 1849 and 1869 he presided over the meetings of the Cambrian Archaeological Association held at Cardiff and Bridgend, and in 1871 was president of a section of the Royal Arch√¶ological Institute. In 1862 he accompanied Montalembert on a tour in Scotland, and five years later travelled in France and Italy, with the view of making a special study of campaniles. But Irish arch√¶ology mainly occupied him. He is said to have visited every barony in Ireland, and nearly every island off the coast. He was usually attended by a photographer, and Dr. William Stokes and Miss Margaret Stokes were often in his company. After Petrie's death in 1866, Dunraven took it upon himself to complete his book, Notes on Irish Architecture. He spent four years traveling and working on Notes, two lengthy folios published after his death, under the editorship of Margaret Stokes, with a preface by the fourth Earl of Dunraven, and notes by Petrie and Reeves. The work was illustrated by 161 wood engravings, from drawings by G. Petrie, W. F. Wakeman, Gordon Hills, Margaret Stokes, Lord Dunraven, and others, besides 125 fine plates. The first part dealt with stone buildings with and without cement, and the second part with belfries and Irish Romanesque. As an appendix to his mother's book, Memorials of Adare Manor, Dunraven compiled a minute and exhaustive treatise on architectural remains in the neighbourhood of Adare. Part of this, treating of the round tower and church of Dysart, was reprinted in vol. ii. of the ‚ÄòNotes.‚Äô Many of these half-ruined buildings were, by Dunraven's munificence, made available for religious purposes. He also contributed some valuable papers to the Royal Irish Academy. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Archaeological Institute in 1831, Fellow of the Society of Arts in 1836, Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1837, and on 10 April 1834 became Fellow of the Royal Society. Montalembert dedicated to him a volume of his Monks of the West. Dunraven died at the Imperial Hotel, Great Malvern, on 6 October 1871, and was buried at Adare on 14 October.

Semantic publication provides a way for computers to understand the structure and even the meaning of the published information, making information search and data integration more efficient.Batchelor, C.R., and Corbett, P.T. (2007) Semantic enrichment of journal articles using chemical named entity recognition. Proceedings of the ACL 2007 Demo and Poster Sessions, pages 45‚Äì48, Prague, June 2007. Although semantic publishing is not specific to the Web, it has been driven by the rising of the semantic web. In the semantic web, published information is accompanied by metadata describing the information, providing a \\"semantic\\" context.Stefan Gradmann: From Catalogs to Graphs: Changing Terms for a Changing Profession Although semantic publishing has the potential to change the face of web publishing, acceptance depends on the emergence of compelling applications. Web sites can already be built with all contents in both HTML format and semantic format. Examples are mindswap, UMBC ebiquity, and web2express.org open lab RSS1.0, uses RDF (a semantic web standard) format, although it has become less popular than RSS2.0 and Atom. Web2express.org applies RDF to various data feeds. Anyone can use their service free online service (ufeed) to create and provide RDF data resources and datafeeds for products, news, events, jobs and studies. Semantic publishing has the potential to revolutionize scientific publishing. Tim Berners-Lee predicted in 2001 that the semantic web \\"will likely profoundly change the very nature of how scientific knowledge is produced and shared, in ways that we can now barely imagine\\". Revisiting the semantic web in 2006, he and his colleagues believed the semantic web \\"could bring about a revolution in how, for example, scientific content is managed throughout its life cycle\\". Researchers could directly self-publish their experiment data in \\"semantic\\" format on the web. Semantic search engines could then make these data widely available. The W3C interest group in healthcare and life sciences is exploring this idea. self-publishing of experiment A demo is available. Two approaches *Publish information as data objects using semantic web languages like RDF and OWL. Ontology is usually developed for a specific information domain, which can formally represent the data in its domain. Semantic publishing of more general information like product information, news, and job openings uses so-called shallow ontology. The SWEO Linking Open Data Project W3C SWEO Linking Open Data Project maintains a list of data sources list of data sources that follow this approach as well as a list of Semantic Publishing Tools.

The storm dropped heavy snowfall throughout the Nova Scotia peninsula and Prince Edward Island, with accumulations in the hardest-hit areas ranging from . Meteorological history The storm formed approximately southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, on February 17, 2004. It intensified over the Gulf Stream, moving at 35‚Äì40 km/h (21‚Äì24 mi/h) before striking Atlantic Canada. Impacts Snow fell at a rate of per hour for 12 straight hours, and sustained winds blew at up to per hour. The snowstorm dropped a record- breaking of snow on CFB Shearwater, beating the previous record of set February 1, 1960. It also broke the record for the most snow in Yarmouth with of snow, surpassing the that fell on January 16, 1977. Numerous unofficial reports placed a snowfall of nearly in many regions across the province. The storm also produced sustained winds ranging from 60 to 80 km/h through much of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador with maximum 1 minute gusts of per hour reported at many stations. Much of central, northern and western New Brunswick received little to no snow or wind as the storm tracked toward the east. Two weather stations in the Halifax Regional Municipality reported 10-second gusts nearing . However, these reports have never been confirmed by Environment Canada. Weather radar observations, as well as synoptic report, showed extensive thundersnow embedded within the blizzard; in the heaviest bands, accumulation rates exceeded . The wind combined with the intense snow rates produced visibilities of or less in most areas for brief periods, however these conditions persisted for at least eight hours in much of Nova Scotia. The wind also whipped up snow drifts which in some cases covered two and three-storey buildings and made many roads impassable to both common motor vehicles and snow removal equipment. The humid continental climate of coastal Nova Scotia typically does not experience extreme snowfalls, compared with northern Nova Scotia, Cape Breton Island, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick. Thus the blizzard and heavy snowfall had a crippling effect on the Halifax Urban Area for several days following the storm as public works personnel struggled to clear streets and roads. For several nights following the storm, a 10 p.m. curfew was implemented on residents in the Halifax Regional Municipality to permit operation of snow removal equipment. Due to a lack of space to displace the excess snow, the municipality had to receive permission from the federal government to begin dumping the snow into Halifax Harbour from federally owned docks in addition to the usual privately owned docks. The storm also had an effect on the 2004 Special Olympic National Winter Games, which were being held in Charlottetown, PEI.

Written by Krzysztof Kie≈õlowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz, the film was expanded from Dekalog: Five of the Polish television series Dekalog. Set in Warsaw, Poland, the film compares the senseless, violent murder of an individual to the cold, calculated execution by the state. A Short Film About Killing won both the Jury Prize and the FIPRESCI Prize at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival, as well as the European Film Award for Best Film. Plot Waldemar Rekowski (Jan Tesarz) is a middle-aged taxicab driver in Warsaw who enjoys his profession and the freedom it affords. His concern for turning a profit leads him to ignore some potential fares in favor of others. An overweight and crude man, Waldemar also enjoys staring at young women. Jacek ≈Åazar (Miros≈Çaw Baka) is a 21-year-old drifter who recently arrived in Warsaw from the countryside and is now aimlessly wandering the streets of the city. He seems to take pleasure in causing other people's misfortunes: he throws a stranger into the urinals of a public toilet after being approached sexually; he drops a large stone from a bridge onto a passing vehicle causing an accident; and he scares away pigeons to spite an old lady who was feeding them. Piotr Balicki (Krzysztof Globisz) is a young and idealistic lawyer who has just passed the bar exam. He takes his wife to a caf√© where they discuss their future. At the same caf√©, Jacek is sitting at a table handling a length of rope and a stick which he keeps in his bag. The rope and stick appear to be a weapon. He puts away the rope and stick when he spots two girls playing at the other side of the window and he engages in a game with them. One of the most crucial moments that relates to the encounter with the young girls is Jacek's sister's death. He goes to a photographer to have her first communion picture blown up despite its wear and tear damage. This is the focal point of Jacek's trauma, which is brought up during his conversation with the young lawyer. It may also be construed as a redeeming value to his character/persona, as he seems to be deeply affected by his little sister's death, as well as his mother's suffering. Jacek holds on to his sister's memory and the love for his mother by asking Piotr to retrieve the blow-up of his sister's picture from the photographer, as he gives Piotr the receipt, and give the picture to his mother, so she has something to hold on to after having two of her children killed. Meanwhile, Waldemar has been driving his taxicab around the city looking for a fare. He stops near the caf√© just as Jacek approaches and enters the cab. He asks to be driven to a remote part of the city near the countryside and insists the driver take a longer and more remote route. At their destination, Jacek tries to kill Waldemar with the rope, but stops and hides when people approach. The driver is still breathing and tries unsuccessfully to remove the rope from his neck. Jacek then completes his gruesome task by repeatedly smashing the barely conscious taxicab driver over the head with a large rock. Jacek then takes the taxicab to the river and dumps the body. When a children's song comes on the radio, he gets upset, rips out the radio, and discards it. He drives the car to a grocery store where he talks to a girl who jumps into the car. She notices a clown's head hanging from the mirror and asks Jacek where he got the car. He suggests that they could go away together, but she keeps asking where the car comes from as a taxi driver with the same car was trying to flirt with her earlier the same day. Sometime later, Jacek is caught and imprisoned. He is interviewed by his criminal defense lawyer, Piotr, for whom this is his first case after finishing his legal studies. Piotr has little chance of winning the case against Jacek because of the strong evidence against his client. In spite of Piotr's efforts, Jacek is found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging. Piotr approaches a judge afterwards asking if he could've done more to save his client's life. The judge assures him that Piotr gave the best argument against the death penalty he's heard in years, but that the legal outcome is correct. On the appointed day, the executioner arrives at the jail and prepares for the hanging. Piotr is at the prison to attend the execution, and an official congratulates him on having just become a father. In the moments before his execution, Jacek reveals to Piotr that his baby sister was killed by a tractor driven by his drunken friend, and that he was drinking with him; he says he never fully recovered from the tragic episode. Jacek then requests that he be given the final space in his family's grave which was reserved for his mother‚Äîthat he be buried next to his sister and his father. The warden repeatedly asks if they are finished talking; Piotr defiantly says he will never be finished. Jacek makes some petty last requests to his lawyer. They conclude things would've turned out differently if the girl had not tragically died. Jacek is then taken from his cell and marched to the execution chamber by several prison guards. The confirmation of his sentence is read to him as well as the decision to deny clemency. He is given last rites by a priest, and offered a final cigarette by the warden. When he requests to have one without filter instead, the executioner steps forward, lights one of his cigarettes and puts it into Jacek's mouth. Jacek takes a few puffs before it is stubbed out. Just before he is hanged, he breaks free from his guards and begins to yell uncontrollably before his hands are shackled and he is quickly hanged with ruthless efficiency. Afterwards, Piotr drives to an empty field where he sobs.

This is greatly enhanced by the strong use of colour filters. The print appears to have an effect similar to sepia tone or bleach bypass‚Äîalthough it is a colour picture, the photography combined with grey locations provides an effect similar to monochrome. A Short Film About Killing was released in the same year that the death penalty was suspended in Poland. In 1988 the country carried out just a single execution, with 6 condemned prisoners being hanged in 1987. The portrayal of the execution method and procedure is mostly accurate, however in reality the date of executions were a surprise to the prisoner‚Äîthe condemned man would simply be led into a room to discover it was the execution chamber. After the early years of Communist repression, executions were quite rare and invariably for murder; from 1969 a total of 183 men were hanged and no women. Themes ;Social class In her article about the film, Janina Falkowska describes the brutality of the effects class societies have on the lower class, emphasizing on the \\"hopelessness\\" of the latter and false hope of the former.Falkowska, J. (Winter 1995). \\"'The Political' in the Films of Andrzej Wajda and Krzysztof Kieslowski\\" in Cinema Journal. 34 (2), pp. 37-50. ;Law and politics Falkowska also talks about the law as a personified entity‚Äîcapable of being both just and unjust, responsible for saving and ruining lives. Its integrity is thus significant to the fate of the protagonist. ;Death and mutiny Cine-literacy author Charles V. Eidsvik suggests there is a \\"presence of senseless malice in the film\\", a notion reiterated in the forms of death and mutiny.Eidsvik, Charles (Fall 1990) \\"Kieslowski's Short Films\\" in Film Quarterly. Found here: http://www.petey.com/kk/docs/shorts1.txt Style Dehumanizing filters were used to distort the images of Warsaw, creating a raw, unattractive image. Kie≈õlowski credits his cinematographer, Slawomir Idziak, for this deliberate visual unattractiveness within the film, stating: \\"I sense that the world is becoming more and more ugly. . . . I wanted to dirty this world. . . . We used green filters that give this strange effect, allowing us to mask all that isn‚Äôt essential to the image\\".Haltof, Marek (2004) the cinema of Krzysztof Kie≈õlowski: variations on destiny and chance (London: Wallflower Press). Pp. 92-93 When Kieslowski first showed Idziak the screenplay, he commented, saying, \\"I can‚Äôt even read this! It disgusts me,\\" and then finally conceded, \\"I‚Äôll shoot it only on the condition that you let me do it green and use all my filters, with which I‚Äôll darken the image.\\" Kieslowski was not pleased, but he accepted the ultimatum, telling Idziak, \\"if you want to make green shit, it‚Äôs your affair.\\" The cinematographer concluded, \\"That‚Äôs how the graphic concept came about which Cahiers Du Cinema wrote that it was the most originally shot movie in the Cannes Film Festival.\\"Insdorf, Annette (1999).

Idziak also used a hand held camera when filming; this gave an added raw feel to the film as it follows the daily routines of the film's protagonist. Production Filming locations The film was shot on location in Warsaw and Siedlce. Like the gloomy events portrayed in the film, the capital city of Warsaw is depicted as a repellent, depressing place: grey, brutal and peopled by alienated characters.

Although the film's diegesis does not directly address political events, it is unanimously interpreted as a political statement. The Polish audience did not like the parallel alluded to between a murder committed by an individual and a murder committed by the state. Despite this controversy, the majority of critics praised Kieslowski's film and it was nominated for and won a multitude of awards.Falkowska, J.

Kieslowski himself selected Dekalog: Five, leaving the second for the Polish ministry of culture. The Ministry selected Dekalog: Six and funded both productions. The cinematic release of Dekalog: Five: A Short film about killing, premiered in Polish cinemas in March 1988. Although the main plot in both works is the same, Dekalog: Five has a different order in editing and makes more use of voice-over, whereas the film starts differently and gives a more prominent role to Piotr, the lawyer. Dekalog: Five suddenly jumps from the killing scene to jail and there is no connection or explanation on how Jacek got arrested. A few scenes and lines of dialogue do not feature in Dekalog: Five, to keep it within the time limitations for TV as intended.

In criminal law, motive in itself is not an element of any given crime; however, the legal system typically allows motive to be proven to make plausible the accused's reasons for committing a crime, at least when those motives may be obscure or hard to identify with. However, a motive is not required to reach a verdict.Law Library - American Law and Legal Information - JRank Articles. (n.d.). Retrieved October 14, 2014. Motives are also used in other aspects of a specific case, for instance, when police are initially investigating. The law technically distinguishes between motive and intent. \\"Intent\\" in criminal law is synonymous with Mens rea, which means the mental state shows liability which is enforced by law as an element of a crime. \\"Motive\\" describes instead the reasons in the accused's background and station in life that are supposed to have induced the crime. Motives are often broken down into three categories; biological, social and personal.Types of Motives: Biological, Social and Personal Motives. (n.d.). Retrieved October 14, 2014.  Objections  There are two objections to motive when considering punishment. The first is volitional objection, which is the argument that the person cannot manage his or her own motives and therefore cannot be punished for them. The second objection is neutrality objection. This is based on the idea that our society has contrasting political opinions and therefore a government‚Äôs preference should be limited.  Pertinence  There are four different ways a defendant's motive can be pertinent to his or her criminal liability. Motive can be fully inculpatory or exculpatory or only partially inculpatory or exculpatory. When one has acted with a specific motive, lawful behavior becomes illegal, and this is when motive is fully inculpatory. If illegal activity with a particular motive does not hold a defendant responsible then that motive is fully exculpatory. When a motive supplies inadequate defense to a crime, the motive is partially exculpatory. When a motive says the kind of infraction for which the defendant is responsible, the motive is partially inculpatory.

It follows a portion of Bonanza Road near the downtown area of Las Vegas. The route encompasses a small portion of former State Route 5 and the entirety of former State Route 5A, and also carried U.S. Route 95 (US 95) before it was relocated to its present freeway alignment. Route description View at the east end of SR 579 looking westbound in 2015 SR 579 as it goes under the Clark Avenue (now Bonanza Road) Railroad Underpass looking westbound in 2010 State Route 579 begins at the junction of Bonanza Road and Rancho Drive (SR 599, US 95 Business). From there, the highway heads east along Bonanza Road, traveling past various business including the offices of the Las Vegas Review-Journal newspaper. SR 579 passes underneath Interstate 15, U.S. Route 93 and the Union Pacific Railroad tracks (at the Clark Avenue Railroad Underpass) as it parallels Interstate 515, U.S. Route 93 and U.S. Route 95. The road then curves slightly southeast, aligning with the downtown street grid as it intersects Main Street. Bonanza Road then passes by various City of Las Vegas buildings, including the municipal pool and Las Vegas Fire & Rescue headquarters. State Route 579 ends at the intersection of Bonanza Road and Las Vegas Boulevard (former SR 604). History State Route 5, established by 1929, was a major Nevada route connecting south-central Nevada near Goldfield to the southern tip of the state via Las Vegas. That route traveled on what is now SR 579 between Rancho Drive and Main Street, comprising about of Bonanza Road. State Route 5A was also established along Bonanza Road by 1952; it followed the approximately of Bonanza Road between Main Street and Fifth Street (now Las Vegas Boulevard). When US 95 was extended through Nevada in 1940, it was routed along many existing highways in Nevada, the longest of those routes being State Route 5. Thus, US 95 followed the Bonanza Road segment of SR 5 segment beginning in 1940. By 1968, the Las Vegas Expressway, a new facility designed to move traffic west of downtown, was beginning to take shape. By 1982 at the latest, US 95 was removed completely from Bonanza Road/SR 5 and onto the new expressway. SR 5 and SR 5A were affected by the renumbering of Nevada's state highways that began on July 1, 1976. At that time, those two designations were removed from the state highway system. In the process, State Route 579 was established along the portions of Bonanza Road previously covered by the old highway routes.

History The sect was doctrinally related with the earlier Brethren of the Free Spirit. It taught the eventual salvation of all human beings and even of the demons, maintained that the soul of man cannot be defiled by bodily sin, and believed in a mystical state of illumination and union with God so perfect that it exempted from all subjection to moral and ecclesiastical laws and was an infallible pledge of salvation. Both its leaders, Egidius Cantoris, an illiterate layman, and the Carmelite William of Hildernissen, near Bergen-op- Zoom, gloried in the visions with which they claimed to have been favoured. Cantoris in a moment of religious exaltation went so far as to run nude through the streets of Brussels, declaring himself the saviour of mankind. About 1410 Peter d'Ailly, Bishop of Cambrai, seems to have taken the first steps towards the suppression of the heresy. William of Hildernissen consented to a retraction, the sincerity of which appeared doubtful. In 1411, a second investigation resulted in another retraction, but also in a sentence compelling William to return permanently to an extra-diocesan Carmelite monastery after three years' detention in one of the episcopal castles.

They are said to improve cleaning, enhance the enjoyment of bathing, and serve as a vehicle for cosmetic agents. Bath salts have been developed which mimic the properties of natural mineral baths or hot springs. Some bath salts contain glycerine so the product will act as an emollient, humectant, or lubricant. Fragrances and colors are often added to bath salts; the fragrances are used to increase users' enjoyment of the bathing experience. Description A selection of bathing products, including bath salts. Substances often labeled as bath salts include magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts), sodium chloride (table salt), sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), sodium hexametaphosphate (Calgon, amorphous/glassy sodium metaphosphate), sodium sesquicarbonate, borax, and sodium citrate. Glycerin, or liquid glycerin, is another common ingredient in bath salts. Depending on their properties, the additives can be classified as emollient, humectant or lubricant when used in bath salts products. Fragrances and colors are often added to bath salts; in fact, one purpose of salts is as a vehicle or diluent to extend fragrances which are otherwise too potent for convenient use. Other common additives to bath salts are oils (agglomerating the salts to form amorphous granules, the product being called \\"bath beads\\" or \\"bath oil beads\\"), foaming agents, and effervescent agents. Bath salts may be packaged for sale in boxes or bags. Their appearance is often considered attractive or appealing, and they may be sold in transparent containers, showing off, for example, the needlelike appearance of sodium sesquicarbonate crystals. History Bottle of bath salts by Morny, England The earliest systematic exposition of the different kinds of salts, their uses, and methods of extraction was published in China around 2700 BCE. Hippocrates encouraged his fellow healers to make use of salt water to heal various ailments by immersing their patients in sea water. The ancient Greeks continued this, and in 1753 English author and physician Charles Russel published \\"The Uses of Sea Water\\". Effects A bath salt tablet shaped like a seashell. Some bath salts such as phosphates have a detergent action that softens calloused skin and aids in exfoliation (cleaning off dead skin cells). Some bath salts act as water softeners and change the way soap rinses. Some confusion may arise for bathers after their first experience in a bath with soft water. Soap does not lather well with hard water and can leave a sticky feeling. Soft water lathers better than hard water but feels slippery for a longer time during rinsing of soap, even though the soap is coming off faster, because the soap remains soluble. High concentrations of salts increase the density of the water and increase buoyancy, which makes the body feel lighter in the bath. Very high concentrations of salts in water are used in many isolation tank therapies. Isolation tanks are special baths with enclosures which block out all light. Researchers have also studied their use in treating arthritis. Bath fizzies Bath fizzies are material products designed to effervesce in bathwater. They come in the form of amorphous grains of homogeneous mixture, packaged in a box, jar, or envelope; single-use envelopes of mixed powders; and solid boluses of homogeneous or inhomogeneous mixture called bath bombs. Bath fizzies are a form of bath salts in that the products of their use include a salt solution in addition to the carbon dioxide bubbles which are their definitive feature. Their ingredients must include one or more acid(s) and one or more water-soluble bicarbonate, sesquicarbonate, and/or carbonate. In addition they commonly include coloring, fragrance, and/or other water- soluble, water-dispersible, and/or volatile ingredients for esthetic, cosmetic, or skin soothing purposes. This principle of effervescing while releasing other ingredients is the same that has been used by tableted products for children to produce their own carbonated beverages. Fake products used to disguise drugs To evade drug laws, some companies sell a number of powdered recreational designer drugs in packages labelled \\"bath salts\\" . The name derives from instances in which the drugs were sold disguised as true bath salts, with the package claiming that the chemical was intended for use during bathing. The white powder, granules, or crystals often resemble true bath salts such as Epsom salts, but are very different chemically. The drugs' packaging often states \\"not for human consumption\\" in an attempt to circumvent drug prohibition laws. These fake bath salts are mainly sold in shops selling drug paraphernalia such as head shops. Emollient bath additives as an eczema treatment In 2018, a study of 483 children commissioned by the National Institute for Health Research and published in The BMJ, found that bath oils used to help treat atopic eczema in children offered \\"no evidence of clinical benefit\\".

Her husband was Emperor Xiaowu. She was the oldest daughter of the paramount general Gao Huan. Gao Huan had overthrown the Erzhu clan (members of the clan of Erzhu Rong who had overthrown Emperor Xiaozhuang after Emperor Xiaozhuang killed Erzhu Rong in 530) in 532 and removed Emperor Jiemin, making Emperor Xiaowu emperor instead. Around the new year 533, Emperor Xiaowu married her as his empress. The relationship between Emperor Xiaowu and Gao soon deteriorated, as Emperor Xiaowu, wanting to assert his authority, grew increasingly distant from Gao and tried to befriend the independent generals Yuwen Tai, who controlled the western provinces of the empire, and Heba Sheng (Ë≥ÄÊãîÂãù), who controlled the southern provinces, to counter Gao. In 534, believing Emperor Xiaowu to be on the cusp of taking coordinated action with Yuwen and Heba, Gao marched on the capital Luoyang to try to reassert control over the imperial government. Emperor Xiaowu, believing himself to be unable to withstand a Gao attack, fled to Yuwen's domain. Empress Gao did not follow him, but no formal divorce was ever proclaimed by either side, and Emperor Xiaowu did not create another empress. Gao subsequently declared Emperor Xiaowu's distant nephew Yuan Shanjian the Heir Apparent of Qinghe emperor (as Emperor Xiaojing), creating the split between Eastern Wei (with Emperor Xiaojing as its emperor) and Western Wei. Around the new year 535, Yuwen, whose own relationship with Emperor Xiaowu had deteriorated after he refused to condone Emperor Xiaowu's incestuous relationships with his cousins and had killed Yuan Mingyue (ÂÖÉÊòéÊúà) the Princess Pingyuan, who was having a relationship with Emperor Xiaowu, poisoned Emperor Xiaowu to death. When news of Emperor Xiaowu's death reached Eastern Wei, a debate occurred as to whether he should be officially mourned, and the turning issue of the debate toward the eventual decision to mourn him was the fact that no divorce was ever declared between him and Empress Gao. Later in 535, Gao Huan had the former Empress Gao marry Emperor Xiaozhuang's nephew Yuan Shao (ÂÖÉÈü∂) the Prince of Pengcheng, and she therefore carried the title of Princess of Pengcheng. He gave both Yuan Shao much of the Northern Wei imperial treasure as dowry. Because of Yuan Shao's status as Gao Huan's son- in-law (a status he shared with Emperor Xiaojing), he received a number of high positions during the reign of Emperor Xiaojing. In 550, after Gao Huan's son Gao Yang seized the throne from Emperor Xiaojing, ending Eastern Wei and establishing Northern Qi (as its Emperor Wenxuan), Yuan Shao continued to have high positions in government, but his title was reduced to Duke of Pengcheng. In 559, Emperor Wenxuan, believing that the Northern Wei imperial Yuan clan still posed a threat to him, carried out a massacre of members of the Yuan clan, and during the massacre, Yuan Shao was starved to death. It is not known whether the former empress was still alive by this point, however, as no record of her death is available in history.

During its colourful and turbulent history it went from being one of the German capital's most luxurious and celebrated hotels to a bombed-out ruin lost in the wastelands alongside the Berlin Wall. A section of it still survives today, albeit as a fragment incorporated into the soaring modern complex of the Sony Center.  Construction and design  The Hotel was built between 1907 and 1908 by the F√ºrstengruppe (Hohenlohe, F√ºrstenberg und Henckel von Donnersmarck) in accordance with the plans of Otto Rehnig, architect of the nearby and similarly fated Hotel Excelsior. When it opened in 1908 the construction cost an unprecedented 23 million marks (‚Ñ≥). The architectural style, with its richly ornamented sandstone fa√ßade, was that of the Belle Epoque, and the interior palatial design incorporated elements from the Neo-Baroque and Neo-Rococo. The hotel accommodated numerous magnificent halls, amongst these was the Kaisersaal (the emperor's hall). It was here that Kaiser Wilhelm II held an exclusive men's evening. One of the most celebrated aspects of the hotel was a 1600 m¬≤ garden designed by garden architect Willi Wendt, which lay in the inner courtyard. Willi Wendt's inner courtyard garden In the \\"Golden Twenties\\", the Esplanade became the scene of popular tea and dancing afternoons, which were regularly broadcast on the radio. Stars like Charlie Chaplin and Greta Garbo stayed here.  Once destroyed and twice revived  In the winter of 1944/45 90% of the Esplanade was destroyed in bombing raids that crushed the once thriving hub of Potsdamer Platz. The sections that did manage to survive relatively unscathed were the Kaisersaal and the breakfast hall, as well as the stairwell and wash rooms. After the war they were restored and together formed part of the original \\"Esplanade Hall Building\\". The ceiling of the Palm Courtyard was restored and one of the other halls, the Silver Hall, was redesigned with its walls and ceiling decorated with silver and pillars adorned with abstract figures and patterns. And so, amidst what was then a rubble-strewn wilderness, the revived Esplanade became a hive of public activity once more. During the 1950s it was used variously as a restaurant and for fancy dress dances and carnival balls, and then later also for fashion shows. However, in 1961 the Berlin Wall was erected only a short distance away. As a consequence the lively programme of festivities was promptly curtailed. Nevertheless, although now adrift from the rest of the city it was, with police permission, still accessible and so began a third lease of life as a popular set for films and television programmes. The interior can be seen in such international films as Cabaret (1972) and Wings of Desire (1987).  The preservation of historical monuments  The remains of the Kaisersaal peer out from behind the glass fa√ßade of the Sony Center After the fall of the wall in 1989 the remaining part of the hotel was safeguarded as a listed historical monument. However, when the resurrection of Potsdamer Platz was underway and the first plans for the new Sony Center were drawn up, this factor was not considered; the Kaisersaal stood in the way and was therefore earmarked for demolition. In 1993 a plan was developed to move the Kaisersaal 75 metres (246 feet) and integrated into the Center itself. This was carried out in March 1996 at a cost of 75 million marks. The Breakfast Hall was dismantled into 500 pieces and then later put back together again; this can be found today in Caf√© Josty.

He was best known as the host of The $64,000 Challenge from 1956 to 1958, and as the writer and host of Ralph Story's Los Angeles from 1964 to 1970. Biography Story was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan. He started his broadcasting career in the late 1940s, after serving as a United States Army Air Forces flight instructor and P-51 fighter pilot during World War II. Story had his big break in broadcasting in 1948, when he was hired to host and direct an early morning show on KNX radio in Los Angeles. At the suggestion of the station's managers, he changed his name to Ralph Story. Story's casual style and witty observations about life in Los Angeles made him a popular host and won him national recognition. Story later moved into network television, where, in 1956, he began hosting the hugely popular game show, The $64,000 Challenge. The CBS show was canceled in 1958 while several networks were embroiled in allegations that popular contestants were supplied with answers in advance. Television journalism Story, who was not implicated in the scandal, returned to local broadcasting in 1960. He returned to KNX, this time anchoring a news program and later joined The Big News, one of the nation's first hour-long local TV newscasts, on KNXT-TV (sister station to KNX radio, owned and operated by CBS). His regular feature, \\"Human Predicament,\\" about people caught in unusual events and situations, became a popular segment. It developed into a local news magazine program about the people and places of Los Angeles called Ralph Story's Los Angeles. It aired for six years. Ralph Story's Los Angeles aired from 1964 to 1970 on KNXT. Created by producer/director Dan Gingold, it featured the work of two exceptional writers, Jere Witter and Nate Kaplan. Wittily hosted by Story, the show examined interesting features, events and sites documenting the history and culture of Los Angeles. Generations of Angelenos developed a passion for their city as a result of this documentary- style show. Select episodes of Ralph Story's Los Angeles are housed at the UCLA Film & Television Archive and are available for public viewing by advance appointment via the Archive Research and Study Center located in Powell Library, room 46 on the UCLA campus. Story joined KABC-TV in February 1971, co-hosting AM Los Angeles, a morning news show with Stephanie Edwards and newsman Bob Banfield that became the precursor to Good Morning America. In one episode, they explored the way that a new Baskin-Robbins ice cream flavor was developed by creating the Apricot Marmalade flavor (to match the \\"AM\\" initials). When the program evolved into GMA and moved to New York City, Story stayed in Los Angeles, where he continued working as a writer, producer, and reporter for several TV stations. After a brief stint on KNBC, he returned to KNXT in 1978 as an evening anchor. In 1985, Story retired and moved to Santa Barbara County's wine region, where he and his second wife, Diana, operated an art gallery in Los Olivos. In 1989, Ralph appeared in the television film, \\"Ernest Goes to Splash Mountain\\" which was shot in Disneyland. He volunteered for numerous civic groups, serving as a fundraiser for public television stations, narrator for the Hollywood Bowl and judge of the Rose Parade. In 1995, he wrote and hosted a program about Los Angeles landmarks called \\"Things That Aren't Here Anymore\\" for KCET and followed it up with a sequel. Death Story died on September 26, 2006, in Santa Ynez, California from complications due to emphysema, and was survived by his wife and one son from his first marriage. His interment was at Oak Hill Cemetery in Ballard, California.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/15900769 Awards In 1984, the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences honored him with its highest honor, the Governor's Award.

The highway is the former route of U.S. Route 93 (US 93) and US 95 (and, historically, US 466) before they were moved to the current freeway alignment shared with Interstate 11 (I-11) and Interstate 515 (I-515). Known primarily as Boulder Highway, the route connects Downtown Las Vegas with Henderson and (now indirectly) Boulder City to the southeast. Route description Exit 70 for Boulder Highway (SR 582) from I-515/US 93/US 95 southbound in 2011 Present-day SR 582 officially begins at I-11/US 93/US 95 interchange at Wagonwheel Drive in Henderson, although the highway itself actually starts at the intersection of Boulder Highway and Wagonwheel Drive just east of the interchange. From its southern terminus, SR 582 quickly transitions to an urban divided highway lined with businesses as it heads northwest through Henderson. The portion of SR 582 between Tropicana Avenue (SR 593) and the I-515/US 93/US 95 freeway is sometimes referred to as the \\"Boulder Strip\\", playing off the more-famous Las Vegas Strip to the west. This section of Boulder Highway features a landscaped median and is adjacent to several local casinos, including Boulder Station and Sam's Town Hotel and Gambling Hall. North of the Boulder Strip area, SR 582 changes names from Boulder Highway to Fremont Street as it crosses the Las Vegas city limits at Sahara Avenue. Just south of Charleston Boulevard (SR 159), Fremont Street transitions from divided highway to a multi-lane arterial. SR 582 reaches its northern terminus at the \\"Five-Points\\" intersection with Charleston Boulevard (SR 159) and Eastern Avenue. North from here, Fremont Street continues beyond the state highway terminus, curving slightly more westward as it heads into Downtown Las Vegas. History Looking southbound in 2015, from the then-current north end of SR 582 at Eighth Street Boulder Highway was constructed in 1931, and carried SR 5 from 1932 to 1939. It later carried US 93, US 95, and US 466 from near Boulder City through Henderson and into downtown Las Vegas. The US 466 designation was later removed in 1971. During the late 1980s, the Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT) worked to extend the US 95 (Oran K. Gragson Expressway) southeast from downtown to Henderson. As portions of the freeway opened, the US 93 and US 95 designations were gradually relocated from Fremont Street and Boulder Highway, relegating the highway to state route status. In 1995, the freeway was completed to the Wagonwheel interchange and US 93 and US 95 had been completely removed from SR 582. Looking northbound in 2015, from the then-current northern terminus at Eighth Street; the Fremont East District is directly ahead In Downtown Las Vegas, Fremont Street originally extended further west to terminate at Main Street (former US 91, later SR 601). In September 1994, Fremont Street west of Las Vegas Boulevard was permanently closed to vehicular traffic to construct the Fremont Street Experience, an outdoor pedestrian mall and light show attraction. This section of SR 582 ceased to be maintained by Nevada DOT around this time. In 2007, the city of Las Vegas completed the Fremont East district, a reconstruction of Fremont Street between Las Vegas Boulevard and Eighth Street designed to \\"stir memories of old Las Vegas\\" and promote active nightlife. Completion of this project moved the northern terminus of SR 582 southward to Eighth Street. NDOT removed the portion of SR 582 between Charleston Boulevard and Eighth Street from its maintenance logs by the beginning of 2019, and had begun the process of transferring ownership of that section of roadway to the City of Las Vegas.

Brower began performing blackface song-and-dance acts in circuses and variety shows when he was 13. He eventually introduced the bones to his act, helping to popularize it as a blackface instrument. Brower teamed with various other performers, forming his longest association with banjoist Dan Emmett beginning in 1841. Brower earned a reputation as a gifted dancer. In 1842, Brower and Emmett moved to New York City. They were out of work by January 1843, when they teamed up with Billy Whitlock and Richard Pelham to form the Virginia Minstrels. The group was the first to perform a full minstrel show as a complete evening's entertainment. Brower pioneered the role of the endman. After a successful tour in the British Isles, Brower returned to the United States and teamed with Emmett and other blackface performers for a time. In the 1850s, he left minstrelsy to work in the Tom shows based on Uncle Tom's Cabin. He returned to minstrelsy briefly as the decade closed and nostalgia for the old minstrel show came into fashion. In 1867, Brower retired from show business and opened a saloon. Early life and career Francis Marion Brower was born on November 20, 1823, in Baltimore, Maryland.The date is from Knowles, p. 94. Nathan, Dan Emmett, p. 113, says he was born on November 30. Brower began his career at age 13, first performing at Dick Meyer's Third and Chestnut Streets Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Brower claimed to have learned to dance from black people, and he took to doing song-and-dance blackface performances in circuses and theatres.Nathan, Dan Emmett, 113.Knowles 94. For the 1840 season, Brower toured with the Cincinnati Circus Company, paired with a banjoist named Ferguson. The two became the stars of the show. In 1841, Brower teamed up with banjoist Dan Emmett, who had been playing banjo in the circus orchestra. Brower took up the playing of the bones, making him one of the earliest to marry the instrument with blackface theater. The following season, Brower and Emmett toured with Raymond and Waring's Circus.Nathan, Dan Emmett, 110‚Äì11. The duo became well known, and Brower earned a reputation as a first-tier dancer. Brower's introduction of acrobatic leaps to the stage caught on with other blackface performers. His act was well enough known that Master Juba (William Henry Lane) did an impression of Brower dancing (an 1845 playbill for the Ethiopian Minstrels, with whom Juba was touring, lists Brower as the fifth ranked dancer in Juba's show).Nathan, Dan Emmett, 113, note 3. In November 1842, Brower and Emmett moved their act to New York City. They played a variety house called the Franklin Theatre in Chatham Square and added a young dancer named Pierce to the act. Emmett likely played banjo as Brower and Pierce danced. All three likely sang. The New York Herald on December 4, 1842 called Brower \\"the perfect representation of the Southern Negro characters\\".Quoted in Nathan, Dan Emmett, 114. By mid-December, Brower quit the trio, but he and Emmett had reteamed by January 1 in a show billed as \\"Negro Holiday Sports in Carolina and Virginia\\".Nathan, Dan Emmett, 114. The Virginia Minstrels That same month, Brower and Emmett were out of work. They joined two other blackface performers‚ÄîRichard Pelham, and Billy Whitlock‚Äîto form the Virginia Minstrels, the first group of blackface performers to put on a full minstrel show.Sacks and Sacks 5. Brower took the role of one of the minstrel endmen and played the bones. His performance style was characterized by wild poses and antics while he played, and he and fellow endman Dick Pelham, the featured dancers, broke into \\"Virginia Breakdown\\" dances. Brower wrote some songs for the troupe, including \\"Old Joe\\" in 1844;Mahar 21. he did a stump speech called \\"Definition of the Bankrupt Laws\\".Nathan, \\"Performance\\", 40. Later career When the Virginia Minstrels broke up in 1843, Brower and banjoist Joel Sweeney joined Cooke's Circus.Knowles 233, note 19. He and Emmett eventually returned to the United States, arriving on October 7, 1844. They found two more blackface performers and formed a new band, playing at the Lyceum Hall in Salem, Massachusetts, on October 23. The group traveled to Boston and played the Melodeon as the \\"Legitimate Ethiopian Band\\". Emmett and Brower toured together on and off into 1846.Nathan, Dan Emmett, 214‚Äì5. In 1854, Brower took the role of Uncle Tom in the Bowery Theatre's Tom show staging of Uncle Tom's Cabin (a role vacated by Thomas D. Rice).Knowles 98. The production, dubbed \\"Happy Uncle Tom\\" featured Brower as a deaf Uncle Tom and relied on broad humor about deafness for its appeal. Brower also performed a banjo song and jig during the show.Lott 228. Brower briefly returned to minstrelsy in the late 1850s when several companies introduced a nostalgic program derived from minstrelsy's early years.Mahar 37. For example, in January 1859, he joined Sanford's Opera Company in Philadelphia for a two-week engagement during which he did his \\"original Tom Dance and Reel\\". The Sanfords gave him a benefit in October 1855.Mahar 383, note 89. \\"Uncle Frank\\" Brower retired from show business in 1867. He spent his final years running a saloon.

Lyrics of Pasa≈ºer have little in common with the Iggy Pop original. The hero of the new version is a vandal passenger who demolishes the seats in a bus. The group is also making a laugh of the recent stars - Shazza and then- returning Krzysztof Krawczyk, who, as the song says, still sings and records albums, as opposed to Elvis Presley, Jimi Hendrix and other deceased stars.

He was a principal member of the 1997 Constitution Drafting Committee and served as secretary-general of King Prajadhipok's Institute and later cabinet secretary-general under Thaksin Shinawatra's government. After the coups d'√©tat of 2006 and 2014, he helped authoring interim constitutions and served in junta-appointed legislative bodies. In 2017 he has chaired the government's Legal Reform Committee. Life Borwornsak was born in the Southern Thai city of Songkhla. He is divorced from Parichat Chumsai na Ayutthaya, with whom he has two children. After graduating from the prestigious Triam Udom Suksa School, Borwornsak studied law at Chulalongkorn University, obtaining a \\"gold-medal\\" first class honours degree in 1975 and was admitted to the Thai bar the following year. From 1976 he taught as a lecturer at the Faculty of Law of his alma mater. He continued his studies in France, completing a DSU in administrative law from University of Paris II (Panth√©on-Assas) in 1979, a DEA and a third-cycle doctorate in general public law from Paris Nanterre University in 1982. In 1988, Borwornsak became a policy advisor at the Secretariat of the Prime Minister, rising to deputy secretary to the Prime Minister for policy matters the following year. In 1991, he returned to his academic function, teaching administrative law at Chulalongkorn University. Borwornsak was a member of the House Ad Hoc Committee on Constitutional Reform (1993‚Äì94) and a member of the Committee of Democracy Development that amended the 1992 Constitution.Thai Law Source, Short biography at a bibliography of Thai law journals In 1995, he served as the dean of the Faculty of Law. Borwornsak was the secretary-general of the Constitution Drafting Committee preparing the 1997 Constitution. In 1998, he completed a course at the National Defence College of Thailand. From 1999 to 2003, he served as the secretary-general of King Prajadhipok's Institute, a state-run research and education centre for democratic politics and administration. In 2003, he once again entered government service, becoming secretary-general of the cabinet, the highest-ranking civil servant advising the cabinet on legal affairs. In this position he succeeded his personal friend Wissanu Krea-ngam who had become Deputy Prime Minister in Thaksin Shinawatra's government. During the 2005‚Äì06 Thai political crisis and after the dissolution of parliament, both Wissanu and Borwornsak distanced themselves from the Thaksin administration and resigned their respective government posts. Borwornsak temporarily entered Buddhist monkhood. After the 19 September 2006 military coup, Borwornsak Uwanno, alongside Wissanu Krea- ngam and Meechai Ruchuphan, helped the military junta (Council for Democratic Reform under the Constitutional Monarchy, CDR) drafting a post-coup interim constitution. According to political scientist Thitinan Pongsudhirak, Borwornsak and Wissanu could \\"seemingly write constitutions overnight\\". Subsequently, Borwornsak became a member of the junta-appointed National Legislative Assembly. After the 2014 Thai coup d'√©tat, Borwornsak was appointed member of the National Reform Council (NRC), serving as this body's deputy speaker. At the same time, he chaired the junta-appointed Constitution Drafting Committee.Bangkok Post, \\"Charter drafter sees 'grand coalition\\" However, in September 2015, the draft was rejected by a majority of the NRC members, resulting in a dissolution of both the drafting committee and the NRC itself. Borwornsak was replaced by Meechai Ruchuphan as chairman of a new Constitution Drafting Committee. In August 2017, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o- cha appointed him chairman of the Legal Reform Committee.‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ä‡∏Å‡∏¥‡∏à‡∏à‡∏≤‡∏Ø ‡πÄ‡∏ú‡∏¢‡πÅ‡∏û‡∏£‡πà‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏®‡∏ï‡∏±‡πâ‡∏á‡∏Ñ‡∏ì‡∏∞‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏£‡∏°‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏õ‡∏è‡∏¥‡∏£‡∏π‡∏õ‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏® 11 ‡∏î‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô, Thai PBS, 15 August 2017. Work Being strongly involved in the drafting of the Thai constitutions of 1997 and 2017 as well as the 2006 interim constitution, Borwornsak is considered to be one of the country's most influential constitutional experts. In the 1997 Constitution drafting process, he was a main advocate of the introduction of a Constitutional Court modelled after continental European courts. At the same time he was apprehensive of providing the court with too much power and successfully advised against mentioning it in article 7, a crucial provision for constitutional conflict situations. As a legal scholar, Borwornsak has published articles justifying the strong role of the monarchy in Thai politics, the severe punishment of L√®se majest√© as well as the recurrent military coups toppling democratically elected governments in the country. After his retirement from the Thaksin administration in 2006, he published a lengthy article about the \\"Ten Principles of a Righteous King\\" and their role in Thai constitutional tradition, lauding the monarch as the \\"Supreme Arbitrator and Conciliator of the Nation\\".Cited in According to Borwornsak, Thailand's sovereignty resides in both the monarchy and the people. By granting a constitution in 1932, the King shared his sovereignty with the people. After each coup d'√©tat, the sovereignty reverts to the monarch until he signs an interim constitution, whereby he again shares sovereignty with the people. Political scientist Eug√©nie M√©rieau mentions Borwornsak, together with Wissanu Krea-ngam and Meechai Ruchuphan, as a leading example of academics who laid the legal foundations for authoritarian government in Thailand and an exponent of a \\"legal‚Äìmilitary alliance for illiberal constitutionalism\\".

San Gennaro dei Poveri is a former monastery and church complex, later converted into a hospital for indigent located on Via San Gennaro dei Poveri #25 in the Rione Sanit√†, of the city of Naples, Italy. The elongaged complex rises towards Capodimonte, lying just south of the domed Basilica dell'Incoronata Madre del Buon Consiglio. History Originally, the site housed a paleo-christian church, putatively erected at the site of an Ancient Roman temple dedicated to Vulcan. Supposedly the then Bishop of Naples, later St Severus of Naples (died 409), transferred the venerated relics of St Januarius, to a church of San Gennaro extra Moenia (San Gennaro outside the walls) located on the northernmost corner of the complex.Notizie del bello dell'antico e del curioso della citt√† di Napoli, Volume 5; by Carlo Cerano; Curated by Giovanni Battista Chiarini; Stamperia di Agostino di Pascale, Naples (1860); page 312. Over the following centuries, these relics were divided and moved till they were putatively collected in the Cathedral of San Gennaro in central Naples. By the early 9th century, a Benedictine monastery with an attached hospital was founded here under the government of Archbishop Athanasius I. The late 9th century Archbishop and Duke of Naples, Athanasius of Naples, moved the body of his uncle and namesake from the Abbey of Montecassino to this church.Celano, page 312-313. By the 15th century, dissensions within the monastery led to its dissolution, and in 1468 the Cardinal Oliviero Carafa formulated the building into a hospital funded by various neighborhoods. After the plague of 1656, the hospital was expanded and by 1669 the viceroy Pietro Antonio of Aragon, seeking to move much of the indigent handicapped individuals (arcattoni) out of the city center, converted the hospital into a hospice for the poor.Celano, page 313. As such, San Gennaro dei Poveri was the first hospice for the poor in Naples, and remained the major such site until the 1750s, when the much more ambitious project of the Royal Hospice for the Poor was built. San Gennaro still functions as a hospital.

The route was designated in 2002, replacing a portion of SR 146. Route description View at the west end of SR 564 looking eastbound State Route 564 begins as a continuation of the Las Vegas Beltway, starting where I-215 ends at its junction with I-11 and I-515, which are concurrent with US 93 and US 95. From there, the route travels east along Lake Mead Parkway, a major arterial roadway, towards downtown Henderson and intersects the Boulder Highway (SR 582). SR 564 continues northeast through Henderson's residential neighborhoods and turns east just west of Lake Mead National Recreation Area. SR 564 enters the park, at a point southeast of Lake Las Vegas, and terminates at the end of state maintenance, while the road continues east. Around 52,500 vehicles travel on the highway near its western terminus on average each day. History In the late 1970s, the highways in the state highway system were renumbered. SR 41 was split into two state routes. SR 146 started from I-15 to US 93/US 95 in Henderson. SR 147 started from US 93/US 95 to North Las Vegas. A limited access highway alignment from US 93/US 85 started construction in 1985‚Äì86. An interchange was built for SR 146 in 1989‚Äì90, and the highway was completed by 1995‚Äì96. The designation I-515 was added to the highway. In the same period, SR 147's designation was removed from eastern section of Lake Mead Drive, and replaced by SR 146. As the Las Vegas Beltway (I-215) was being constructed in the late 1990s, the last between Saint Rose Parkway and Interstate 515 were constructed on the SR 146 alignment. This left SR 146 in two separate segments. The eastern segment of SR 146 was reassigned to SR 564 by 2002. I-215 from SR 146 to SR 564's western terminus was completed in October 2005.

As an officer of the Austro- Hungarian Empire he began his scientific work at the Bureau of Meteorology. In 1921 he became Chief Astronomer at the new Geodetic Survey of Austria (Federal Office for Metrology and Survey or Bundesamt f√ºr Eich- und Vermessungswesen). From 1936 to 1942 and from 1945 to 1949 he was a Professor at the Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien) and over the 1948-9 term he was the university's rector.  Life  German Charles-Ferdinand University, January 13, 1905 He was born on 28 October 1881 in Trautenau, northern Bohemia (now Trutnov, Czech Republic). He studied mathematics, physics, geophysics and astronomy at the University of Prague and the University of Munich between 1899 and 1904. In 1905 at the Charles University in Prague he delivered his dissertation on \\"The average and relative distribution of temperature on the Earth's surface.\\" His first job was as an assistant at the Prague Observatory, and then at the Bureaux of Meteorology in Berlin, Innsbruck and Vienna. In 1908 he transferred to the Maritime Observatory in Trieste (now the Istituto Talassografico di Trieste or ITT), then in 1912 to the Bureau of Geodesy (Gradmessungsb√ºro) in Vienna. During World War I he was head of the meteorological service for the Isonzo Army of Austria-Hungary. In 1921 he became Chief Astronomer at the new Geodetic Survey of Austria (\\"Bureau of Weights, Measures and Surveying\\" or Bundesamt f√ºr Eich- und Vermessungswesen). In 1936 he was appointed Professor of Theoretical Geodesy and Spherical astronomy at the Vienna University of Technology, as successor to Richard Schumann. In autumn 1942 he declined Hitler's invitation into his newly created Academy of Sciences (Akademie der Wissenschaften) in Prague, and was forced into retirement, moving with his family to Sch√∂nb√ºhel on the Danube, where he devoted himself exclusively to research. After the war he was restored to his position in Vienna, and was later elected Dean of the Faculty of Applied Maths and Physics. His pleasant friendliness made him popular with colleagues and students, and in the 1948-9 term he was voted Rector magnificus at the Technical High School of Vienna. In the last month of his incumbency, he drowned in a boating accident on the Hintersteiner See, near Kufstein.  Work  From the very beginning of his career he made valuable contributions to astronomy, geodesy, geophysics and meteorology, in the applied fields as well as the theoretical, and published a great deal on all four subjects. He wrote three well-known textbooks.  Trajectories of planetoids  Hopfner's early work was mostly concerned with astronomy and meteorology. In collaboration with Johann Palisa, he determined the trajectories and ephemerides of a number of planetoids.  Mathematical foundations of a theory of climatology  In 1906 he began researching problems bordering both astronomy and geophysics, starting with the warming of the Earth by the Sun. We owe mainly to Hopfner the sharp distinction he made between the daily and seasonal average irradiation. In 1927 he went into the subject in more detail, laying out his discoveries in his Mathematical Foundations of an Astronomical Theory of Climatic Variation (Mathematische Grundlagen zu einer astronomischen Theorie der Klimaschwankungen), which won him the Seegenpreis.  Research on tides  His work at the Maritime Observatory in Trieste led him to study oceanographical questions, for example on tides and the determination of water levels in Trieste harbour, both very important practical problems.  Advanced geodesy and geophysics  With his entry to the Gradmessungsb√ºro in 1921 he turned to geomensuration and geophysics, in particular his work on the meridian arc Gro√üenhain-Kremsm√ºnster-Pola, which detailed the use of comparisons of vertical deflections. Later he studied the important problem of the geoid (the Earth's shape), for example through the reduction of observations of weight and the subject known as isostasy (the study of gravitational equilibrium within the Earth). From the 1930s he concentrated on the study of the reference ellipsoid and phase diagrams, as well as the elliptical shape of the Equator, the level spheroid, and the triaxial Jacobi ellipsoid.  Contributions to Austrian science  Hopfner did pioneering work on the determination of geographical distances without the use of wires (the first employment of time-signals), as well as on gravimetry. His study of the Earth's magnetic field helped make a name for the ZAMG, or Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (Zentralanstalt f√ºr Meteorologie und Geodynamik) in Vienna.

On 10 March 2010, Raqibul announced his shock retirement from international cricket. Although he had secured his place in Bangladesh's Test squad, Raqibul's decision was made in protest to his exclusion from the ODI team that faced England and Bangladesh's squad for the 2010 T20 World Cup. A week later, Raqibul went back on his decision but his contract with the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) was terminated and he was told he wouldn't be considered available to play for his country for three months. Raqibul returned to the Bangladesh squad in June 2010 when he was called up to for his country's tour of England. His comeback from retirement lasted just one match before he was sidelined with injury. Raqibul returned to the Bangladesh side on 8 July in the first ODI against England at Trent Bridge. He made 76 in his team's innings before being struck on the foot by a delivery from James Anderson. A runner was sent for, but Raqibul was run out without facing another ball. After the match it emerged that Raqibul's toe was broken and that he would miss the rest of the tour. When the BCB announced its list of central contracts in November 2010, Raqibul has given a grade C contract. When the squad to tour Zimbabwe for a Test and five ODIs was announced in July 2011, Mohammad Ashraful and Raqibul were competing for the same place; Ashraful was chosen over Raqibul due to his greater experience. In April 2012 the BCB announced its contracts for the coming year and Raqibul's central contract was not renewed. He was the leading run-scorer for Mohammedan Sporting Club in the 2018‚Äì19 Dhaka Premier Division Cricket League tournament, with 781 runs in 16 matches.

It stars Gregor Fisher and Billy Boyd as Jacky Allen and Tony MacBryan respectively, two men who work for a property maintenance company 'Greater Glasgow Building Services'. Situation and plot Each episode mostly revolves around the dialogue of the two main characters as they discuss their lives (and unseen wives) and the things they find in the houses they clear. Jacky and Tony are also given to re-enacting silent comedy and music hall routines, and always take a polaroid photo of themselves which they date and hide in a crevice somewhere. The pair also like to guess what they will find behind each door before they open it. As befits their personalities, Jacky's guesses are usually amusing and fanciful, while Tony's are often gruesome, even macabre. Although the main duo interact with various other characters over the course of the series, the only supporting character to appear in more than one episode is Barry, a plumber who dresses like Super Mario and is nicknamed \\"Super Barrio\\" by Jacky and Tony (though he has never heard of the character and doesn't understand the joke). Barry is played by Tom Urie. The series is written by Robert Florence and Iain Connell, who wrote the series Burnistoun, Legit and sketches for Chewin' the Fat, also produced by BBC Scotland. Episode list  #\\"Nobody knows what goes on behind closed doors\\" ‚Äì Tony and Jacky clear a house in which they discover a room full of elegant hand-crafted models of sailing ships, and are shocked by the callous attitude of a woman to comes to \\"collect\\" one. #\\"Is is\\" ‚Äì The duo clear a house in which they find a number of curious objects, including a dada mural and a motorcycle in the bath, prompting a competition to provide the best explanation of what had been going on in there. There is a cameo appearance by writer Iain Connell. #\\"Happiness\\" ‚Äì Tony and Jacky do repairs at the home of an elderly woman and become concerned that her dementia may put her in danger, but cannot agree on whether to tell her son. #\\"Protection\\" ‚Äì The pair are sent to clear a crime scene, but are surprised to find it has been taken over by squatters. #\\"Night Moves\\" ‚Äì Tony and Jacky spend the night in the office, setting practical jokes on their new boss. #\\"Ghosties\\" ‚Äì While carrying out repairs in an old theatre, Tony tries to persuade Jacky that they should leave the company and go into business together.

It is generally similar to the closely related silverfish but can be distinguished by being rather stouter and less shiny with all appendages (antennae and 3 \\"tails\\") noticeably longer. The abdomen is often marked with dark brown lines and the species is sometimes called four-lined silverfish. This species is native to southern Europe but is now found throughout most of the world as an accidental introduction although it is absent from polar and cooler temperate regions (e.g. the British Isles). It is found both indoors and outdoors and can be a nuisance pest. Recent studies on this species in Europe suggest that there is enough geographical variation to justify splitting into several species, with one form already having been given specific status as Ctenolepisma almeriense from south-eastern Spain. Lepisma pilifera Lucas, 1840, which was considered a synonym of C. lineatum, is now treated as a synonym of Thermobia aegyptiaca (Lucas, 1840).

Several different versions are known, but all feature a male protagonist singing of his lover Mary Blane, her abduction, and eventual death. \\"Mary Blane\\" was by far the most popular female captivity song in antebellum minstrelsy. Lyrics \\"Mary Blane\\" has at least five different sets of lyrics, the most of any song of its type.Mahar 284. All tell the same typical Victorian-era captivity narrative: A woman is kidnapped or captured and may do no more than await rescue by a male protagonist or suffer at the hands of her captors.Mahar 283. In most variants, the male singer and the female victim are married or longtime lovers. The lyrics usually begin by describing the history and current condition of their relationship prior to the abduction:Mahar 293. :I once did know a pretty Gal, :And took her for my wife :She came from Louisiana, :And I lik'd her as my life. :We happy lib'd together :She nebber caus'd me pain, :But on one dark and dreary night :I lost my Mary Blane.Words by F. C. German, arranged by J. H. Howard (1847). \\"Mary Blane\\". New York City: Firth and Hall. Quoted in Mahar 291. The identity of Mary Blane's abductors varies. In one edition, \\"A nigger come to my old hut\\"; in another \\"De white man come into my house, / And took poor Mary Blane\\".Words W. Guernsey, music George Barker (1848[?]). \\"The New Mary Blane\\". Boston, Massachusetts: Ditson. Quoted in Mahar 291. Yet another variant makes the captors American Indians.1848\\\\. \\"Mary Blane\\". New York City: William VanDerbeek. Quoted in Mahar 292. Another makes them Northern abolitionists, thus poking fun at the slave rescues carried out by some abolitionists. The male protagonist then pines for his lost love and wallows in self-pity in later verses and during the chorus: :Oh, Farewell, Farewell poor Mary Blane :One Faithful heart will think of you :Farewell, Farewell poor Mary Blane :If we ne'er meet again. The song usually ends tragically, with the lover confused and unable to take action or learning of Mary's death. In the odd version where the lovers are reunited, Mary Blane dies shortly thereafter:Mahar 296. :I took her home unto my hut, :My heart was in great pain, :But afore de sun did shone next day :Gone dead was Mary Blane. Some variants go into lurid detail about the treatment Mary receives. In one, she is tied to a tree, tarred and feathered, and ultimately killed.Mahar 294. The song thus highlights two of minstrelsy's most common gender-defined roles: the objectified and silent woman, and the pining male. Minstrel troupes cobbled together texts from different sources and appended or removed verses. As a result, some editions contain entire verses that break the flow of the narrative. Others feature nonsense verses and stock phrases from other songs that have nothing to do with the song. Some variants may have been intended for certain types of audiences or local to certain regions. Structure and performance \\"Mary Blane\\" was sung to two entirely different melodies. The first is 36‚Äì40 measures long and consists of a prelude, a three-part chorus, and a postlude. The measure count varies with the lengths of the prelude and postlude.Mahar 284. Mahar does not describe the structure of the alternate melody. The stage performance of \\"Mary Blane\\" is not well known. However, the song is primarily sentimental in nature, so its singer most likely took a maudlin and melodramatic approach. The seemingly illogical verses that were often added may have served as comedy, or they may simply have provided something familiar to audiences and freed up the company to act out scenes, dance, or do other dramatic bits. Composition and popularity Credits for \\"Mary Blane\\" vary. A version in print from 1844 to 1855 credits words to Wellington Guernsey and music to George Barker. An 1847 edition attributes the song to J. H. Howard. Rival 1848 editions credit Edwin P. Christy or Charles White and John Hill Hewitt. The name of F. C. Germon (or German) appears in credits as well.Mahar 405 note 37. Regardless of who originally wrote or composed it, \\"Mary Blane\\" was by far the most popular song in the lost-lover genre in antebellum blackface minstrelsy. Research by musicologist William J. Mahar's has found versions of the song in more songsters published between 1843 and 1860 than any other number, edging out such hits as \\"Miss Lucy Long\\" and \\"Old Dan Tucker\\".Mahar 367.

He is a left- handed batsman and a right-arm medium-fast bowler who played for Lancashire from 2001 to 2014. Between 2000‚Äì01 and 2002 Hogg represented the England under-19s in six youth Tests and 11 One Day Internationals (ODIs). In the 2006‚Äì07 season he travelled to New Zealand where he represented Otago as an overseas player. Hogg spent time on loan with Nottinghamshire and Worcestershire, both in 2007. He was awarded his county caps by Worcestershire and Lancashire in 2007 and 2010 respectively. Hogg took 50 wickets in the 2011 County Championship to help Lancashire to claim the title for the first time since 1950. Hogg subsequently established himself as Lancashire's opening bowler in first-class cricket alongside captain Glen Chapple. A back injury forced Hogg to retire in September 2014 at the age of 31. Career Born 2 July 1983 in Birmingham, West Midlands, Kyle Hogg's family moved to Oldham when he was a child. Between 2000‚Äì01 and 2002 Kyle Hogg played six youth Test matches for England under-19s. He scored 157 runs at an average of 17.44, with a highest score of 50, and took 20 wickets at an average of 26.45 with one five-wicket haul. Between 2001 and 2002 he also played 11 youth ODIs, scoring 295 runs at an average of 36.87 with a highest score of 103 and taking 11 wickets at a cost of 41.28 runs each with best bowling figures of 3 wickets for 41 runs (3/41). Hogg made his first-class debut on 13 June 2001, representing Lancashire in a match against Durham University Centre of Cricketing Excellence, taking three wickets in the match. The following year in April he played his first match in the County Championship; it was his second first-class match and he took his first five-wicket haul, helping Lancashire to a one-wicket win over Leicestershire. Hogg's relatives include grandfather Sonny Ramadhin and father Willie Hogg. He made a promising start to his career in 2001, at which time there were calls for him to be selected for the full England squad. But in season 2002‚Äì03, When team-mate James Anderson was selected by England in the 2002‚Äì03 season, some pundits wondered whether the selectors had confused him with Hogg. Instead, Hogg found himself struggling with injuries and illness. In Hogg's opinion, the 2006 English season was \\"make or break\\" for his career. In the one-day side, he constantly opened the bowling and felt he produced consistent performance for the first time in his career. As well as claiming 15 wickets in the County Championship, he also took 16 one-day wickets. He scored 254 first-class runs that season, including two half-centuries. In October 2006, Kyle signed to play in the English close season for New Zealand state side Otago after Warwickshire batsman Jonathan Trott, who usually played for Otago as an overseas player, recommended him. In four first-class matches he scored 170 runs with two half- centuries and a highest score of 71 and took five wickets at an average of 62.60. In May 2007 Hogg signed a four-month loan deal with Worcestershire to act as cover for injured seam bowlers Roger Sillence and Matt Mason. While playing for Worcestershire, Hogg claimed 3/44, his best bowling figures in the County Championship since 2002. In June injuries to Lancashire's squad meant that Hogg returned to the club before the conclusion of his four-month contract. Hogg played two first-class and four one-day matches for Worcestershire, taking six and two wickets in the respective formats. While playing for Worcestershire, Hogg was also awarded his county cap. Despite injuries, Hogg struggled to secure a place in Lancashire's first team, and in July 2007 moved to Nottinghamshire on loan for a month to bolster their injury-hit squad. Hogg went wicketless in the two first-class matches he played. he took three wickets at an average of 39.66. After two spells on loan, Hogg felt he was not part of Lancashire's plans and considered leaving the club. Ahead of the 2008 English season, Lancashire toured Dubai as part of pre-season training. Hogg was pleased with his performance on the tour, however a broken bone in his right hand meant he missed the first two weeks of county cricket back in England. In June 2010 Kyle got his best batting figures when he hit 88 in the Roses match against Yorkshire at Old Trafford. Batting at number 10, he helped Lancashire avoid the follow-on and left the ground to a standing ovation from the Old Trafford crowd. In the same match, Hogg took his 100th first-class wicket: that of Adam Lyth who was in the running to become the first batsman to reach 1,000 in the season. At the start of August, Hogg was awarded his county cap. The following month he scored his second first-class half-century of the season, on this occasion 81 against Hampshire. In the same match he took 4 wickets for 53 runs (4/53), his best for the season. In nine first-class matches for Lancashire in 2010, Hogg scored 301 runs (including two half-centuries) at an average of 33.44 and took 20 wickets at average of 32.50. He missed the start of the 2011 season after sustaining a muscle tear in Lancashire's final pre-season warm-up match. At the start of May Hogg again suffered an injury, this time twisting his ankle in training. When not sidelined with injury, Hogg was competing with Sajid Mahmood, Farveez Maharoof, Oliver Newby, and Tom Smith for a place in the team. His first appearance of the season was on 16 May in Lancashire's CB40 defeat to Somerset in which he conceded 63 runs from six over, taking a single wicket. Later that month Hogg played his first County Championship game of the season. He recorded his career best bowling figures, taking 7 wickets for 28 runs against Hampshire (surpassed in June 2013 by taking 7 Northants wickets for just 27 runs conceded) ; it was his second five-wicket haul and first since 2002. Lancashire went on to win the match by ten wickets with Hogg taking career best figures of 11/59 in the match. When Lancashire faced Yorkshire in the County Championship in July, Hogg scored a half-century and took a five-wicket haul to help his team to victory in the Roses match, reaching 150 first-class wickets in the process. Against Nottinghamshire Hogg took his third five- wicket haul of the season in the Championship. The 2011 season was Hogg's most successful: as well as recording his best first-class bowling figures Hogg took 50 wickets in the County Championship for the first time. He also scored 300 first-class runs at an average of 21.47. One of three bowlers to take at least 50 wickets in the County Championship for Lancashire that year, Hogg contributed to the club winning the competition for the first time since it shared the title with Surrey in 1950. On 5 September 2014 Kyle was forced to announce his retirement from cricket due to a serious back injury. He finished his career with 280 first-class wickets from 114 matches with eight five- wicket hauls and one ten-wicket match return. He also scored 2,708 runs with 16 half-centuries.< Since retiring he has taken a position as a tour manager for SJM Concerts http://www.oldham-chronicle.co.uk/news-features/13/local- sport-news/89709/perfect-harmony See also * List of Otago representative cricketers References * Kyle Hogg at Cricket Archive Category:1983 births Category:English cricketers Category:Living people Category:Lancashire cricketers Category:Otago cricketers Category:Worcestershire cricketers Category:Cricketers from Birmingham, West Midlands Category:People from Oldham Category:English people of Trinidad and Tobago descent Category:Nottinghamshire cricketers Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:English cricketers of the 21st century ","title":"Kyle Hogg"},{"id":"7174861","text":"State Route 487 (SR 487) is a north-south state highway in White Pine County, Nevada. The route follows Baker Road from the Utah‚ÄìNevada state line southeast of Baker to U.S. Route 6 and U.S. Route 50 (US 6 and US 50). The route was previously known as State Route 73 prior to 1976. SR 487 is designated as a Nevada Scenic Byway. Route description SR 487 at the Utah state line SR 487 begins as at the Utah state line northwest of Garrison, Utah as the continuation of Utah State Route 21, which serves the towns of Milford and Beaver. From there, the route heads northwesterly on Baker Road through the desert terrain. The highway comes upon the town of Baker, near which there are pockets of farmland. In Baker, the route intersects Lehman Caves Road (SR 488), which is the gateway to Great Basin National Park. Leaving the town, SR 487 continues northwesterly through more desert lands. The route ends at the intersection of US 6/US 50, approximately west of the Nevada‚ÄìUtah state line. First reassurance sign along southbound SR 487 History Baker Road first appears on official Nevada state highway maps as far back as 1937. Although the state's tourist maps did not show Baker Road carrying the State Route 73 designation until 1942, other state maps show the route number existing on the highway by 1937. The route was upgraded to a gravel road by 1948, and was fully paved by 1949. SR 73 was eliminated from the state highway system as part of a mass renumbering of Nevada's state routes. The State Route 487 designation was assigned to the former alignment of SR 73 on July 1, 1976. The resulting change in the highway number was first seen on the 1978-79 edition of the official highway map. Since its re-designation as SR 487, there has not been any major changes to Baker Road.

Reproduction is ovoviviparous. It is of no interest to fisheries and almost nothing is known of its biology. The specific epithet ritteri is in honor of Dr. William Emerson Ritter of the University of California. The largest known example of this shark measured long. It has an elongated body with a broad, flattened head and a moderately long snout. The eyes and spiracles are large. The mouth is broadly arched, containing many teeth with narrow cusps and lateral cusplets. There are two roughly equal-sized dorsal fins with grooved spines; the second spine is longer than the first and slightly curved. The pectoral fins are short and broad, not reaching the first dorsal fin base when folded back. The pelvic fins are small and placed forward of the second dorsal fin. There is no anal fin; the caudal peduncle is long, leading to an asymmetrical caudal fin. This shark is distinctive in being the only Centroscyllium species with abrupt black markings beneath its head, trunk, and pectoral fins, with a black stripe running from under the caudal peduncle to over the pelvic fins. These markings are in fact concentrations of tiny light- emitting photophores. Unusually, this shark also has photophores along the undersides of its upper eyelids. What function these structures could serve is unclear; Tchernavin speculated that they could be used to illuminate prey or stimulate the eye. The rest of the body is gray-brown, with white fin margins. There are numerous small cone-shaped, hooked prickles over the body, except for under the snout.

This globally distributed species has been reported down to a depth of , making it the deepest-living shark known. It inhabits lower continental slopes and abyssal plains, usually staying near the bottom. Stocky and dark brown in color, the Portuguese dogfish can be distinguished from similar-looking species (such as the kitefin shark, Dalatias licha) by the small spines in front of its dorsal fins. Its dermal denticles are also unusual, resembling the scales of a bony fish. This species typically reaches in length; sharks in the Mediterranean Sea are much smaller and have distinct depth and food preferences. Relatively common, the Portuguese dogfish is an active hunter capable of tackling fast, large prey. It feeds mainly on cephalopods and fishes, though it also consumes invertebrates and cetacean carrion. This shark has acute vision optimized for detecting the bioluminescence of its prey, as sunlight does not reach the depths at which it lives. The Portuguese dogfish is aplacental viviparous, with the young provisioned by yolk and perhaps uterine fluid. The females give birth to up to 29 young after a gestation period of over one year. Valued for its liver oil and to a lesser extent meat, Portuguese dogfish are important to deepwater commercial fisheries operating off Portugal, the British Isles, Japan, and Australia. These fishing pressures and the low reproductive rate of this species have led the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assess it as Near Threatened. Taxonomy Early illustration of a Portuguese dogfish. The first scientific description of the Portuguese dogfish was published by Portuguese zoologists Jos√© Vicente Barbosa du Bocage and F√©lix Ant√≥nio de Brito Capello, in an 1864 issue of Proceedings of the General Meetings for Scientific Business of the Zoological Society of London. They created the new genus Centroscymnus for this shark, and gave it the specific epithet coelolepis, derived from the Greek ' (\\"hollow\\") and lepis (\\"fish scale\\") and referring to the structure of the dermal denticles. The type specimen, caught off Portugal, has since been destroyed in a fire. Distribution and habitat One of the widest-ranging deepwater sharks, the Portuguese dogfish is patchily distributed around the world. In the western Atlantic, it occurs from the Grand Banks of Newfoundland to the U.S. state of Delaware. In the eastern Atlantic, it is found from Iceland to Sierra Leone, including the western Mediterranean Sea, the Azores and Madeira, as well as from southern Namibia to western South Africa. In the Indian Ocean, this species has been caught off the Seychelles. In the Pacific, this shark occurs off Japan, New Zealand, and Australia from Cape Hawke, New South Wales, to Beachport, South Australia, including Tasmania. The deepest-living shark known, the Portuguese dogfish has been reported at depths of to from the lower continental slope to the abyssal plain, and is most common between and . This species is found deeper in the Mediterranean, seldom occurring above a depth of and being most common at . The deep Mediterranean has a relatively constant temperature of and a salinity of 38.4 ppt, whereas in the deep ocean the temperature is generally only and the salinity 34-35 ppt. The Portuguese dogfish is essentially benthic in nature, though young sharks can be found a considerable distance off the bottom. There is depth segregation by size and sex; pregnant females are found in shallower water, above , while juveniles are found deeper. There may be several separate populations in the Atlantic, and sharks in the Mediterranean and off Japan appear to be distinct as well. Description The Portuguese dogfish can be distinguished from similar species by its tiny dorsal fin spines. Dorsal and ventral view of the Portuguese dogfish's head, showing the broad, flattened snout and wide mouth. The Portuguese dogfish typically reaches a length of for males and for females, though specimens up to long have been recorded. Sharks in the Mediterranean are smaller, growing no more than long. This species has a flattened, broadly rounded snout that is shorter than the mouth is wide. The nostrils are preceded by short flaps of skin. The eyes are large and oval in shape, positioned laterally on the head and equipped with a reflective tapetum lucidum that produces a yellow-green \\"eye shine\\". The mouth is wide and slightly arched, with moderately thick, smooth lips and short furrows at the corners extending onto both jaws. The upper teeth are slender and upright with a single cusp, numbering 43-68 rows. The lower teeth have a short, strongly angled cusp and number 29-41 rows; their bases interlock to form a continuous cutting surface.Burgess, G. and Bester, C. Biological Profiles: Portuguese Shark. Florida Museum of Natural History Ichthyology Department. Retrieved on October 17, 2009. The five pairs of gill slits are short and nearly vertical. The body of the Portuguese dogfish is thick and cylindrical except for the flattened belly. The two dorsal fins are small and of similar size and shape, each bearing a tiny grooved spine in front. The first dorsal fin originates well behind the pectoral fins, while the second dorsal originates over the middle of the pelvic fin bases. The pectoral fins are medium-sized with a rounded margin. There is no anal fin. The caudal fin has a short but well- developed lower lobe and a prominent ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The very large dermal denticles change in shape with age: in juveniles, they are widely spaced and heart-shaped with an incomplete midline ridge and three posterior points, while in adults they are overlapping, roughly circular, smooth, and flattened with a round central concavity, superficially resembling the scales of bony fishes. Young sharks are a uniform blue-black in color, while adults are brown-black; there are no prominent fin markings. In 1997, a partially albino individual, with a pale body but normal eyes, was caught in the northeastern Atlantic. This represented the first documented case of albinism in a deep-sea shark. Biology and ecology Living almost exclusively in the aphotic zone where little to no sunlight penetrates, the Portuguese dogfish is relatively common and the dominant shark species in deeper waters. The large, squalene-rich liver of this shark allows it to maintain neutral buoyancy and hover with minimal effort; males contain more squalene in their livers than females. A tracking study in the Porcupine Seabight has found that the Portuguese dogfish has an average swimming speed of , and does not remain in any particular area for long. This species may be preyed upon by larger fishes and sharks. Known parasites of this species include monogeneans in the genus Erpocotyle, and the tapeworms Sphyriocephalus viridis, S. richardi, and Anthobothrium sp. An active predator of mobile, relatively large organisms, the Portuguese dogfish feeds mainly on cephalopods (including Mastigoteuthis spp.) and bony fishes (including slickheads, orange roughy, lantern fishes, and rattails). It has also been known to take other sharks and invertebrates (such as the medusa Atolla wyvillei), as well as scavenging from whale carcasses. The Portuguese dogfish has more acute vision than many other deepsea sharks: in addition to having a large pupil and lens, and a tapetum lucidum, its eyes also contain a high concentration of ganglion cells mostly concentrated in a horizontal streak that is densest at the center; these cells impart highly sensitive motion detection along the horizontal plane. The visual system of this species appears adapted for detecting bioluminescence: the maximum absorption of its visual pigments correspond to the wavelengths of light emitted by favored prey, such as the squids Heteroteuthis dispar, Histioteuthis spp., Lycoteuthis lorigera, and Taningia danae. In the Mediterranean sea, the Portuguese dogfish is one of the most common deepwater sharks along with the blackmouth catshark (Galeus melastomus) and the velvet belly lantern shark (Etmopterus spinax), and the only shark abundant below a depth of . By inhabiting deeper water, Portuguese dogfish in the Mediterranean may reduce competition with the other two species. The smaller size of Mediterranean sharks relative to those from the rest of the world may be due to limited food availability and/or the warmer, saltier environment. Some 87% of the diet of Portuguese dogfish in the Mediterranean consists of cephalopods. Bony fishes are a secondary food source, while immature sharks favor the shrimp Acanthephyra eximia, the most common decapod crustacean in their environment. Unlike in other regions, Mediterranean sharks seldom scavenge. Life history The Portuguese dogfish is aplacental viviparous, with the female retaining eggs internally until they hatch. The embryos are sustained by yolk, and possibly also by uterine fluid secreted by the mother. Figueiredo et al. (2008) reported that there are two breeding seasons per year off Portugal, from January to May and from August to December, with only a fraction of the population reproductively active at a time. However, previous accounts have described continuous reproduction with females in various stages of pregnancy present year-round. The ovarian follicles take some time to mature; they are ovulated into the uterus at a diameter of . Studies of females have found no traces of sperm inside their reproductive tracts, which suggests that fertilization occurs immediately following copulation, which may also trigger ovulation. The reproductive cycles of Portuguese dogfish in the Atlantic and Pacific are generally similar; sharks off Japan tend to produce larger numbers of smaller oocytes than elsewhere, while sharks off the British Isles exhibit a larger litter size and birth size (but smaller oocytes) than those off Portugal. There is a record of a hermaphroditic specimen with an ovary on its right side and a testis on its left. Early in development, the embryos are sexually undifferentiated, unpigmented, and possess filamentous external gills; the external yolk sac in this stage weighs . Recognizable sex organs develop by an embryonic length of , and tissue differentiation is complete by a length of . Body pigmentation appears when the embryo is long; the external gills regress at around the same time. An internal yolk sac develops when the embryo is long, which begins to take in yolk as the external yolk sac shrinks; by the time the embryo is long the external yolk sac has been completely resorbed. Off Portugal, the young seem to be born in May and December following a gestation period of over a year. As they near giving birth, the females undergo ovarian atresia (regression of the follicles), suggesting that they enter a resting period afterwards. The litter size ranges from 1 to 29 (typically 12), and is not correlated with female size. Parturition may occur in a yet-unknown nursery area, as newborns are rarely ever caught. The length at birth has been reported as in the Atlantic, and in the Pacific.Daley, R., J. Stevens and K. Graham. (2002).

NAFO SCR Doc. 02/83 Human interactions The Portuguese dogfish is an important component of several deepwater fisheries. The Portuguese dogfish is too small and occurs too deep to pose a danger to humans. This species has long been commercially fished, using hook-and-line, gillnets, and trawls. It is mainly valued for its liver, which contains 22-49% squalene by weight and is processed for vitamins. The meat may also be sold fresh or dried and salted for human consumption, or converted into fishmeal. An important fishery for the Portuguese dogfish exists in Suruga Bay for liver oil; catches peaked during World War II, but declined soon after from over- exploitation. In the past few years, catches by the South East Trawl Fishery off Australia have been increasing, as fishers have been seeking out species not covered by commercial quotas following the relaxation of seafood mercury regulations. Shark landings in this fishery are affected by a prohibition on landing livers without the rest of the carcass. Until recently, Portugal was the only European country to utilize the Portuguese dogfish. An important bycatch of the black scabbardfish (Aphanops carbo) longline fishery, between 300 and 900 tons of this shark were landed annually from 1986 to 1999. Its per-weight value has been increasing since 1986, and thus exploitation is likely to continue. Around 1990, French bottom trawlers began to fish for Portuguese dogfish and leafscale gulper sharks (Centrophorus squamosus) west of the British Isles for meat and livers; these two species are together referred to as siki. The siki catch peaked at 3,284 tons in 1996 before declining to 1,939 tons in 1999. The French have since been joined by Norwegian, Irish, and Scottish longliners and trawlers, making the Portuguese dogfish a significant component of deepwater fisheries in the northwest Atlantic. While stocks off Portugal seem to be stable for now, stocks off the British Isles have diminished substantially in recent years; this may reflect the disparity between the less massified Portuguese fishery and the commercial French fishery. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened, because of its commercial value and low reproductive productivity. In June 2018 the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the Portuguese dogfish as \\"Not Threatened\\" with the qualifier \\"Data Poor\\" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.

SR 3 first appears on official state highway maps in the late 1920s. By the mid-1930s, it was undergoing changes that would shrink it and eventually divide it into two separate highways. In 1935, US 395 was extended into Nevada and routed concurrently with SR 3 from Reno to Holbrook Junction. In 1937, US 6 was extended into Nevada and routed concurrently with SR 3 between Tonopah and Coaldale. By 1941, the northern terminus of SR 3 was truncated to the junction with US 395 at present-day Holbrook Junction, eliminating the duplication of route numbers between there and Reno. A major change occurred in 1940. US 95 was extended into Nevada and replaced SR 3 from the junction with SR 5 south of Goldfield north to Schurz. SR 3 was now a discontinuous highway. The northern section ran from Schurz to Minden. The southern section ran from south of Goldfield to the California state line via Lida. Another major change occurred in 1941 when Alternate US 95 (initially mislabeled on state maps as US 95) replaced the section of SR 3 from Schurz to Yerington. From 1941, SR 3 remained largely unchanged until 1978 when it was replaced in a statewide highway renumbering project. The northern section from Minden to Yerington was renumbered as SR 208.

At the time of his death, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that he was \\"reckoned among mental giants\\" and that he was \\"an authority of world-wide prominence\\" in many branches of science. Early life Behr came from a prominent family with connections to the administration of the principality of K√∂then (also Koethen, Goethen or Colthen). He attended schools in K√∂then and Zerbst where he studied Greek, Latin, Hebrew and mathematics. As a boy he developed an interest in natural history, including collecting birds' eggs. In 1837 he began his study of medicine, first at the Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg and later at the Humboldt University of Berlin where he graduated in 1843 as Doctor of Medicine. (In 1898, on his eightieth birthday, he was given the unusual honour of having his degree renewed by the University of Berlin at the recommendation of Rudolf Virchow.) Whilst at Wittenberg he had developed an interest in botany and a passing interest in the sport of duelling which left him with scars on his face. Time in Australia Encouraged by his friends and mentors, Alexander von Humboldt and Karl Ritter, Behr left Bremerhaven on 27 May 1844 bound for Australia to study botany and entomology, in particular insects in the orders Lepidoptera and Coleoptera. Arriving at Port Adelaide on 12 September 1844, he travelled to the Lutheran settlement at Bethanian and spent 13 months in the colony of South Australia exploring areas around Gawler, Lyndoch, the Barossa Ranges and the Light, Murray and Onkaparinga rivers. He collected insect and botanical specimens, sending reports back to Europe. He also lived with Aboriginal people, learning their languages and studying their customs. Return to Germany On 9 October 1845, Behr left the colony, the only passenger apart from the captain's wife, on a small boat, the Heerjeboy Rustomjee Patell, heading for Amsterdam via Batavia. The boat was attacked by pirates near Bali but the Patell eventually made it safely to Cape Town then Amsterdam, arriving on 19 May 1846. He spent the next two years in Germany and had papers on the insects of the Adelaide area published in Entomologische Zeitung Stettin and on Australian flora in Linnaea : Ein Journal f√ºr die Botanik in ihrem ganzen Umfange. The next 115 pages of the latter journal are devoted to descriptions of 200 plants by Dietrich von Schlechtendal, collected by Behr. In 1848, the political situation in Germany was tense and Behr himself was becoming involved in socialist activities. To avoid the young man's becoming more involved, Behr's father arranged for his son to return to Australia, travelling as ship's surgeon to Adelaide via Rio de Janeiro. Return to Australia Behr was back in South Australia on 6 November 1848 and soon returned to Bethanien. He stayed in South Australia for about one year, during which time he met the Victorian Government botanist, Ferdinand von Mueller and William Hillebrand, who was later to publish Flora of the Hawaiian Islands. Behr was the first person to systematically study the flora of many parts of South Australia. Many of his collections were named and described by other botanists, including 62 new species by Schlechtendal and others by Meisner, Sonder and Miquel. Many species were named after Behr including Aristida behriana, Baeckea behrii, Caladenia behrii, Diuris behrii, Eremophila behriana, Eriochlamys behrii, Eucalyptus behriana, Lasiopetalum behrii, Loudonia behrii, Prostanthera behriana, Senecio behrianus and Swainsona behriana. The genus Behria Greene is also named after him. Late in 1849 both Behr and Hillebrand travelled to the Philippines and practised medicine there for about 7 months. United States of America By September 1850, Behr was in the United States of America where he lived in San Francisco for the next 54 years. In 1853 he returned briefly to Germany to marry Miss Agnes Omylska. They had three children in America but his wife died shortly after the birth of the youngest. He earned a living as a doctor but there were sometimes conflicts, as when he was accused by the Lutheran newspaper of being a Jesuit, resulting in patients leaving him and forcing him to move his practice. Behr continued to collect and describe insects and their relationship with plants and contributed to a number of academic journals including Proceedings of the Entomological Society of Philadelphia and Transactions of the American Entomological Society. In 1872, the California Pharmaceutical Society was formed and in the same year, the Society appointed Behr professor of botany and he was required to organise excursions \\"into the country on alternate weeks for the purpose of collecting and studying indigenous plants.\\" Also formed in the same year was the Bohemian Club and in its second year, Behr became a member. In 1884 he found time to write a paper Synopsis of the genera of vascular plants in the vicinity of San Francisco, with an attempt to arrange them according to evolutionary principles writing \\"In looking from any stand-point, at the variety of organic forms, the theory of evolution will be the most successful in explaining the resemblances and differences of organized life.\\" In 1891 and 1896, Behr published two essays entitled Botanical Reminiscences in which he describes the changes in the vegetation of San Francisco from 1850. The California Academy of Sciences elected Behr to the position of vice-president in 1895 and three years later he was made curator of entomology. He later donated his large collection of Lepidoptera to the Academy but it was destroyed in the earthquake of 1906. He authored a number of books including The Plants of the Vicinity of San Francisco and a book of verse, The Hoot of the Owl. Behr Avenue in San Francisco is named after him. On 6 March 1904 Behr died at his home at 1215 Bush Street, at the age of 85 years and 6 months. An obituary, written by his friend Alice Eastwood was published in Nature.

Neptune was originally going to be the successor of Windows Me, though based on the NT kernel. Microsoft merged the teams working on Neptune with that of Windows Odyssey, Windows 2000's successor, in early 2000. The resulting project, codenamed \\"Whistler\\", went on to become Windows XP. Development work on Windows XP was completed in August 2001, and the operating system was released on October 25 of that year.  \\"Neptune\\" and \\"Odyssey\\"  In the late 1990s, initial development of what would become Windows XP was focused on two individual products; \\"Odyssey\\", which was reportedly intended to succeed the future Windows 2000, and \\"Neptune\\", which was reportedly a consumer-oriented operating system using the Windows NT architecture, succeeding the MS-DOS-based Windows 98. Based on the NT 5.0 kernel in Windows 2000, Neptune primarily focused on offering a simplified, task-based interface based on a concept known internally as \\"activity centers\\", originally planned to be implemented in Windows 98. A number of activity centers were planned, serving as hubs for email communications, playing music, managing or viewing photos, searching the Internet, and viewing recently used content. A single build of Neptune, 5111 (which still carried the branding of Windows 2000 in places), revealed early work on the activity center concept, with an updated user account interface and graphical login screen, common functions (such as recently used programs) being accessible from a customizable \\"Starting Places\\" page (which could be used as either a separate window, or a full-screen desktop replacement). It was later confirmed that Microsoft were planning a successor to Neptune known as Triton, although it was originally thought to be a service pack to Neptune. However, the project proved to be too ambitious. Microsoft discussed a plan to delay Neptune in favor of an interim OS known as \\"Asteroid\\", which would have been an update to Windows 2000 (Windows NT 5.0), and have a consumer-oriented version. At the WinHEC conference on April 7, 1999, Steve Ballmer announced an updated version of Windows 98 known as Windows Millennium, breaking a promise made by Microsoft CEO Bill Gates in 1998 that Windows 98 would be the final consumer-oriented version of Windows to use the MS-DOS architecture. Concepts introduced by Neptune would influence future Windows products; in Windows Me, the activity center concept was used for System Restore and Help and Support Center (which both combined Win32 code with an interface rendered using Internet Explorer's layout engine), the hub concept would be expanded on Windows Phone, and Windows 8 would similarly use a simplified user interface running atop the existing Windows shell.  \\"Whistler\\"  In January 2000, shortly prior to the official release of Windows 2000, technology writer Paul Thurrott reported that Microsoft had shelved both Neptune and Odyssey in favor of a new product codenamed \\"Whistler\\", after Whistler, British Columbia, as many Microsoft employees skied at the Whistler-Blackcomb ski resort. The goal of Whistler was to unify both the consumer and business-oriented Windows lines under a single, Windows NT platform: Thurrott stated that Neptune had become \\"a black hole when all the features that were cut from [Windows Me] were simply re-tagged as Neptune features. And since Neptune and Odyssey would be based on the same code-base anyway, it made sense to combine them into a single project\\". At WinHEC in April 2000, Microsoft officially announced and presented an early build of Whistler, focusing on a new modularized architecture, built-in CD burning, fast user switching, and updated versions of the digital media features introduced by Me. Windows general manager Carl Stork stated that Whistler would be released in both consumer- and business- oriented versions built atop the same architecture, and that there were plans to update the Windows interface to make it \\"warmer and more friendly\\". In June 2000, Microsoft began the technical beta testing process. Whistler was expected to be made available in \\"Personal\\", \\"Professional\\", \\"Server\\", \\"Advanced Server\\", and \\"Datacenter\\" editions. At PDC on July 13, 2000, Microsoft announced that Whistler would be released during the second half of 2001, and also released the first preview build, 2250. The build notably introduced an early version of a new visual styles system along with an interim theme known as \\"Professional\\" (later renamed \\"Watercolor\\"), and contained a hidden \\"Start page\\" (a full-screen page similar to Neptune's \\"Starting Places\\"), and a hidden, early version of a two-column Start menu design. The Professional/Watercolor theme was never meant to be the final theme for Whistler, in fact it has been stated that Microsoft used Watercolor as a decoy, until they were ready to show Luna. Build 2257 featured further refinements to the Watercolor theme, along with the official introduction of the two-column Start menu, and the addition of an early version of Windows Firewall.  Beta versions  Microsoft released Whistler Beta 1, build 2296, on October 31, 2000. In January 2001, build 2410 introduced Internet Explorer 6.0 (previously branded as 5.6) and the Microsoft Product Activation system. Bill Gates dedicated a portion of his keynote at Consumer Electronics Show to discuss Whistler, explaining that the OS would bring \\"[the] dependability of our highest end corporate desktop, and total dependability, to the home,\\" and also \\"move it in the direction of making it very consumer-oriented. Making it very friendly for the home user to use.\\" Alongside Beta 1, it was also announced that Microsoft would prioritize the release of the consumer-oriented versions of Whistler over the server-oriented versions in order to gauge reaction, but that they would be both generally available during the second half of 2001 (Whistler Server would ultimately be delayed into 2003). Builds 2416 and 2419 added the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard and began to introduce elements of the operating system's final appearance (such as its near-final Windows Setup design, and the addition of new default wallpapers, such as Bliss).  Announcement  On February 5, 2001, Whistler was officially unveiled during a media event under the name Windows XP, where XP stands for \\"eXPerience\\". As a complement, the next version of Microsoft Office was also announced as Office XP. Microsoft stated that the name \\"[symbolizes] the rich and extended user experiences Windows and Office can offer by embracing Web services that span a broad range of devices.\\" In a press event at EMP Museum in Seattle on February 13, 2001, Microsoft publicly unveiled the new \\"Luna\\" user interface of Windows XP. Windows XP Beta 2, build 2462a (which among other improvements, introduced the Luna style), was launched at WinHEC on March 25, 2001. In April 2001, Microsoft controversially announced that XP would not integrate support for Bluetooth or USB 2.0 on launch, requiring the use of third-party drivers. Critics felt that in the case of the latter, Microsoft's decision had delivered a potential blow to the adoption of USB 2.0, as XP was to provide support for the competing, Apple-developed FireWire standard instead. A representative stated that the company had \\"[recognized] the importance of USB 2.0 as a newly emerging standard and is evaluating the best mechanism for making it available to Windows XP users after the initial release.\\" USB 2.0 support was later added with Service Pack 1, and Bluetooth support was partially added with Service Pack 2. The builds prior to and following Release Candidate 1 (build 2505, released on July 5, 2001), and Release Candidate 2 (build 2526, released on July 27, 2001), focused on fixing bugs, acknowledging user feedback, and other final tweaks before the RTM build.  Release  In June 2001, Microsoft indicated that it was planning to, in conjunction with Intel and other PC makers, spend at least US$1 billion on marketing and promoting Windows XP. The theme of the campaign, \\"Yes You Can\\", was designed to emphasize the platform's overall capabilities. Microsoft had originally planned to use the slogan \\"Prepare to Fly\\", but it was replaced due to sensitivity issues in the wake of the September 11 attacks. A prominent aspect of Microsoft's campaign was a U.S. television commercial featuring Madonna's song \\"Ray of Light\\"; a Microsoft spokesperson stated that the song was chosen due to its optimistic tone and how it complemented the overall theme of the campaign. On August 24, 2001, Windows XP build 2600 was released to manufacturing. During a ceremonial media event at Microsoft Redmond Campus, copies of the RTM build were given to representatives of several major PC manufacturers in briefcases, who then flew off on decorated helicopters. While PC manufacturers would be able to release devices running XP beginning on September 24, 2001, XP was expected to reach general, retail availability on October 25, 2001. On the same day, Microsoft also announced the final retail pricing of XP's two main editions, \\"Home\\" and \\"Professional\\".

Ed, Edd n Eddy is a 131-episode animated comedy television series created by Danny Antonucci and produced by Canada-based a.k.a. Cartoon. The series debuted on Cartoon Network in the United States on January 4, 1999, and ended on November 8, 2009, with the film Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show. The series was originally planned to air for four seasons, but Cartoon Network ordered two additional seasons, four specials, and a film as a result of its popularity, for a total of 135 stories. The series revolves around three adolescent boys collectively known as \\"the Eds\\", who live in a suburban cul-de-sac. Unofficially led by Eddy, the Eds constantly try to scam the fellow cul-de-sac children in order to purchase jawbreakers. The Eds' plans usually fail and leave them in various predicaments. Feeling confined to gross and edgy work, such as his previous series The Brothers Grunt, artist Danny Antonucci decided to produce an animated children's television show similar to classic cartoons from the 1940s to the 1970s. Antonucci spent months designing the show before trying to sell it to Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network. Both studios reacted enthusiastically and wanted to see more but demanded creative control, which Antonucci refused. Cartoon Network commissioned the show after they agreed to let Antonucci go in his own direction. The first two seasons were released on DVD in 2006 and 2007. Two DVD volumes were also released: Edifying Ed-Ventures on May 10, 2005, in Region 1 and in Region 2 on May 16, 2006, and Fools' Par-Ed-Ise on March 31, 2006, in Region 1.

Viewed from 31 million households worldwide in 29 different countries, Ed, Edd n Eddy was popular among both younger and older viewers. During its run, the series won a Reuben Award, two Leo Awards and a SOCAN Award out of a total of 11 award nominations, which include one Reuben Award, six Leo Awards, one Annie Award, two Kids' Choice Awards and the SOCAN Award.

Virginia Street (U.S. Route 395 Business, former SR 430) in Reno and continues due north a few miles. Once passing E.

Kietzke Lane continues past the terminus of SR 667 to Victorian Avenue (I-80 Business). History During the late 1970s, US 395 in Reno was being upgraded to a freeway. By 1976, the new North-South Freeway, now signed as US 395 (and I-580, as of 2012), had been completed from the north of Reno down to E. Second Street. To facilitate the connection with existing US 395 in south Reno, Temporary US 395 was designated by 1976. The temporary designation went west from the freeway terminus along E. Second Street to Kietzke Lane, and then followed present-day State Route 667 south from E. Second Street to S. Virginia Street, where it intersected with US 395. By 1982, the US 395 freeway had been completed to S. Virginia Street, eliminating the Temporary designation on SR 667. As late as 2006, State Route 667 continued along Kietzke Lane south from South Virginia Street to its intersection with Neil Road. From there, the route turned east and followed Neil Road to connect with I-580 / US 395 before terminating at S. Virginia Street (SR 430). As of 2008, this portion of State Route 667 has been removed from the state highway system; however, the portion of Neil Road under I-580 / US 395 is currently maintained by Nevada DOT as a frontage road (FRWA44).

Only a few airframes have survived, as in the Central Finland Aviation Museum in Finland. History In spite of their economic problems, the aircraft manufacturer Valmet began designing a new aircraft at the beginning of the 1950s, to replace the aging Finnish Air Force (FAF) VL Pyrys. Martti Vainio was the chief designer of the project. Most of the planning was made by the aeronautical engineers L. H√§m√§l√§inen and T. M√§ntysalo in 1948‚Äì49. The Bristol Mercury, then being manufactured under license in Finland for the Bristol Blenheim bomber, was chosen as the engine, since it was readily available. The prototype (VH-1) made its first flight on 6 February 1951, in Tampere, piloted by captain Esko Halme. After successful test flights, the FAF ordered 30 production aircraft, called Valmet Vihuri II, on 27 February 1951. In the autumn of 1954, the Air Force ordered a further 20 aircraft of the developed version Valmet Vihuri III. All the aircraft of the third version were handed over to the Air Force on 15 January 1957. Valmet built 51 Vihuris in three different models in Kuorevesi and Tampere. The aircraft had the registration codes VH-1 through VH-51. Operational use Vihuri canopies used as roof windows The Vihuri aircraft became the most-used aircraft in FAF service by the mid-1950s. The aircraft was subject to many accidents, and the press raised much concern over this. The safety of the Vihuri even became a matter for the government. In May 1959, the aircraft was permanently grounded. Attempts were made to sell the aircraft to Tunisia, without success. After inspection, it became apparent that the type and its design were sound; most of the accidents were due to pilots' often grave violations of flight regulations, and the fact that all airframes were well worn by the end of the 1950s. The other problem was the engines. The engines used, Tampella Mercury, were recycled engines of wartime Bristol Blenheim bombers which were already worn out. The planes were sold for scrap to Moser OY. One airframe, VH-18, survives in the Central Finland Aviation Museum, and the fore fuselage of another, VH-25, is being restored. The canopies of the scrapped aircraft remain today as the roof windows of the Kuusakoski metal-recycling plant in Espoo. Operators ; *Finnish Air Force Specifications (Valmet Vihuri II)  Notes This aircraft is not to be confused with the Finnish fast bomber variant of De Havilland Mosquito, with DB 605 engines, a project which never materialized. In 1943 the FiAF HQ asked VL if it would be possible to build a copy of the Mosquito with DB605 engines. Two crashed British aircraft would have been requested from Germany to serve as models. The primary attraction was the wooden construction (something that the VL was familiar with). The inquiries indicated that serial production could be started sometime in 1946, as there were other aircraft on queue, and there were difficulties in getting just about everything needed to produce a new aircraft. The new aircraft was also to be named \\"Vihuri\\". Preserved aircraft The Central Finland Aviation museum is displaying the VH-18, which is the only preserved Vihuri. It gathered 802 flying hours, after which the aircraft served as an educational machine at the Air Force Academy in Kauhava. See also References * Bridgman, Leonard.

Kits are made for both automatic and manual transmissions.  Goals  Shifts may be optimized for different goals. Some drivers want slow, smooth shifts for comfort, while others want quick shifts for performance or towing.  Towing considerations  During a shift, power is lost in the clutch (for automatic transmissions the clutches are usually internal) due to clutch slip and the difference between the current and final output shaft speeds. This makes a quick shift more desirable when towing, to reduce clutch wear and heat developed in the transmission. Balancing this, too quick a shift increases peak mechanical loads on the transmission, engine and drive train; an instant shift would cause impact loads and lead to early mechanical failure, as well as an unpleasant driving experience. Manual transmission kit For manual transmission equipped cars, it is a component that replaces the stock gear selector (shifter). A shift kit usually shortens the throws of selecting a gear (also known as a short throw shift or short shifter), therefore allowing a driver to reduce the shift time and change gears more efficiently. Automatic transmission kit An automatic transmission's main focus is smooth shifting between gears. To accomplish this it often goes into two gears at once while shifting up, which is known as a shift overlap. In these cars, it is a kit that can reduce or eliminate the shift overlap. It will also reduce wear because the transmission won't be trying to drive in two gears at once. History The term \\"Shift Kit\\" is a registered trademark of the company \\"TransGo\\" which originated the development of automatic transmission valve body improvement and upgrade components such as springs, valves, and instructional materials to improve the shift characteristics and durability of automatic transmissions.

History  Travelling from west to east through Bellot Strait (western end) on MS Ocean Endeavour, September 2019 The first Europeans to see the strait were William Kennedy and Joseph Ren√© Bellot, who reached it by dogsled from Batty Bay in 1852. This proved that Somerset was an island and that Prince Regent Inlet had a difficult westward exit. In 1858, Francis Leopold McClintock tried to pass the strait but had to abandon the attempt. The strait was first crossed from west to east by the Hudson's Bay Company ship Aklavik in 1937, piloted by Scotty Gall. Henry Larsen crossed it in 1942 on the first west-east transit of the Northwest Passage. The Fort Ross trading post on the northern shore was established in 1937, and lasted for 11 years.

The Norweigan government funds the Consumer Council, leaving it free to develop an independent consumer policy and independent of commercial interests and other organisations.  Structure  The Consumer Council has its own board of directors and statutes laid down by the Ministry of Children and Equality and is chaired by Director Inger Lise Blyverket. The Consumer Council employs about 140 people, who work at the headquarters in Oslo and at the offices in Troms√∏/Svalbard, Stavanger and Skien, organised into four departments: communication and digital services, consumer policy, dispute resolution, and staff. The Consumer Council helps put consumer questions on the agenda and promote consumers' interests by influencing authorities, organisations, and businesses; educating consumers through information, advice, and guidance; and helping individual consumers.  Consumer policy  The Consumer policy department runs the Consumer Council's work to influence governmental and business life in a consumer- friendly direction through dialogue, impact work and publications. The policy work is aimed at areas that have a high economic impact for consumers, where consumer satisfaction is low, and potentially could to affect all sectors. In some cases, existing regulations are not enough, and the Consumer Council is therefore working politically to strengthen legal consumer protection. In other cases, the work is about affecting the competitive situation and how markets operate. The Consumer Council also has an extensive international cooperation with sister organizations in Europe, and especially with the umbrella organization in Brussels; BEUC. The priority policy areas of the Consumer Council are Housing, Digital services, Finance, Commerce, and Public services.  Assisting consumers  Each year, 80 000 consumers directly contact the Norwegian Consumer Council for assistance. The Consumer Council also offers free legal dispute resolution between consumers and business, and helps resolving about 10 000 formal disputes every year.

The route follows a portion of Clear Creek Road just south of Carson City. The route was once part of the Lincoln Highway, forming a major travel link between Carson City and Lake Tahoe. SR 705 was designated in 2000, and was only truncated once. Route description View at the east end of SR 705 looking westbound SR 705 begins in Douglas County at the Carson City/Douglas County line southwest Carson City on Clear Creek Road (shown on some maps as \\"Old Clear Creek Road\\"), just north of Clear Creek.

The road bends around desert hills, and the route (SR 705) ends at the Douglas County/Carson City line, but the road continues eastward to an intersection with U.S. Route 395 (US 395). SR 705 is currently not directly connected to the remainder of Nevada's state highway system. History Early travel Trails connecting Lake Tahoe with the Comstock Lode mining region near Carson City had been established in the mid-1800s, with the first wagon road route through Kings Canyon to the north having been constructed by November 1863. This route was eventually selected to become part of the Lincoln Highway and, later, a branch of SR 3. The advent of the automobile greatly changed this region of Nevada. From 1927 to 1928, aided by both state and forest highway funding, a graded two-lane road was constructed along the corridor of Clear Creek to connect Carson City to Spooner Summit, just east of Glenbrook on the eastern shore of Lake Tahoe. The Clear Creek Road replaced the former Kings Canyon route as the major road to Lake Tahoe in 1928, and was subsequently selected as a later realignment of the Lincoln Highway. Clear Creek Road later became part of US 50, but was bypassed in the 1950s by the current four-lane alignment located a short distance to the north. The route today Clear Creek Road remained largely unchanged since it was established. The Nevada Department of Transportation initially designated SR 705, from the current western terminus east to a Bureau of Indian Affairs water diversion box in Carson City, by January 11, 2000. By the beginning of 2006, the short portion with Carson City had been removed from state maintenance, resulting in the current highway segment in Douglas County.

The regiment was formed, as the Duke of Cambridge's Own (Middlesex Regiment), in 1881 as part of the Childers Reforms when the 57th (West Middlesex) and 77th (East Middlesex) Regiments of Foot were amalgamated with the county's militia and rifle volunteer units. On 31 December 1966 the Middlesex Regiment (Duke of Cambridge's Own) was amalgamated with the other regiments of the Home Counties Brigade, the Queen's Royal Surrey Regiment, the Queen's Own Buffs, The Royal Kent Regiment and the Royal Sussex Regiment to form the Queen's Regiment. The latter regiment was, however, short-lived and itself subject to a merger on 9 September 1992 with the Royal Hampshire Regiment to form the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires). The Middlesex Regiment was one of the principal home counties based regiments with a long tradition. They inherited their nickname, the \\"Die-hards\\", from the 57th Regiment of Foot (West Middlesex), which later became the 1st Battalion, Middlesex Regiment. The 57th gained the name during the Peninsular War when, at the Battle of Albuera on 16 May 1811 their commander Colonel Inglis had his horse shot from under him, severely wounded and outnumbered by the French he called to his men \\"Die hard, 57th. Die hard!\\" \\"Albuhera\\" was the principal battle honour on the Middlesex Regiment's colours.

In 1908, with the formation of the Territorial Force (TF), the 1st and 2nd Volunteer Battalions became the 7th and 8th Battalions, while the 3rd (formerly 4th) Volunteer Battalion transferred to the London Regiment, becoming the 19th Battalion (St Pancras). The 4th Volunteer Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps (formerly the 5th (West Middlesex) Volunteer Rifle Corps), joined the Middlesex Regiment as the 9th Battalion. The 10th Battalion was formed by a nucleus of 300 officers and men from the disbanded 2nd (South Middlesex) Volunteer Rifle Corps. The four TF battalions constituted the Middlesex Brigade in the Home Counties Division.Ray Westlake, Tracing the Rifle Volunteers, Barnsley: Pen and Sword, 2010, .Maj A.F.

The regiment inherited the designation \\"Duke of Cambridge's Own\\" from the 77th Foot, to which regiment it had been awarded in 1876. The regiment was also permitted to bear the coronet and cypher of Prince George, Duke of Cambridge on its colours and badges.Ian Sumner, British Colours and Standards 1747 ‚Äì 1881 (2) ‚Äì Infantry, Oxford, 2001 The regiment had earlier been granted the plumes and motto of the Prince of Wales in 1810 for twenty years service in India. In 1921, in common with many other regiments, the regimental title was effectively reversed to The Middlesex Regiment (Duke of Cambridge's Own).Army Order 509/1920, in effect 1 January 1921 The Duke was colonel-in-chief of the regiment from 1898 to his death in 1904. Its regimental marches were 'Sir Manley Power' and 'Paddy's Resource' (quick), and 'Caledonian' and 'Garb of old Gaul' (slow). The regiment relocated from Hounslow Barracks to the newly built Inglis Barracks in 1905. Early service The 1st and 2nd battalions both saw turns in India during the late 19th century. Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War in 1899, the 2nd battalion embarked for active service in South Africa in December 1899 and took part in the storming of Alleman's Nek in June 1900. The 5th and 6th (Militia) battalions were also embodied for active service during the Second Boer War. 760 men of the 5th battalion (formerly the Royal Elthorne Light Infantry) was reported to return home on the SS Assaye in September 1902, after the war had ended. The 6th battalion (formerly the Royal East Middlesex Militia) was embodied in December 1899 (when it was still the 4th Battalion), and 530 officers and men left for service in South Africa in February 1900.

The 2nd Battalion landed at Le Havre as part of the 23rd Brigade in the 8th Division in November 1914 also for service on the Western Front. The 3rd Battalion landed at Le Havre aspart of the 85th Brigade in the 28th Division in January 1915 for service on the Western Front before moving to Egypt in October 1915 and to Salonika in December 1915. The 4th Battalion land at Boulogne-sur-Mer as part of the 8th Brigade in 3rd Division in August 1914 for service on the Western Front. Some 400 men of the 4th Battalion were killed at the Battle of Mons later that month. Territorial force At the start of the First World War the four territorial battalions were sent off to their war stations: the 1/7th and 1/8th, who went to France to serve on the Western Front, and the 1/9th and 1/10th, who went to India to relieve regular troops. Late in 1917 the 1/9th Bn was assigned to the 18th Indian Division and served in the Mesopotamian Campaign in 1918. However, there was a surplus of volunteers who had sought to enlist; these men had joined the Territorial Battalions, and although the War Office wanted them to transfer to the Regular Army or the New (Kitchener's Army), the majority elected to remain with the Territorial Battalions which had enlisted them. General Kitchener was not in favour of the Territorials although he and other critics were silenced after the Territorials fought so well with the BEF after Mons. It became obvious that the First Line battalions that had gone overseas would need reinforcements almost at once and the War Office gave permission to raise Second Line Territorial Battalions and in this way the 2/7th and 2/8th were formed for service with the Western Frontier Force and the 2/10th was formed for service in the Gallipoli Campaign. A Third Line battalion, the 3/10th, also landed at Le Havre for service on the Western Front. New armies Additional war-formed \\"service\\" battalions were the 11th to 34th and 51st to 53rd.Everard Wyrall, The Die-Hards in the Great War, 2 Vols, London: Harrisons, 1926 & 1930/Uckfield: Naval & Military Press, 2002, Two of these Battalions (17th and 23rd) were recruited from footballers and were known as the Football Battalions.

In 1916, the Post Office Rifles, the Princess Louise's Kensington Regiment and 19th Battalion, London Regiment (St Pancras) had been attached to the Middlesex Regiment from the territorial London Regiment, but retained their original titles and distinctions. In 1935 the Post Office Rifles and 19th Londons became searchlight regiments, and in 1937 The Kensingtons formally became a territorial battalion of the Middlesex Regiment.

In 1938 the two territorial battalions formed duplicates, thus forming the 1/7th, 2/7th, 1/8th and 2/8th battalions. Before the Second World War the Middlesex Regiment was chosen as one of four other infantry regiments to be converted to a machine gun regiment. The 1/7th Battalion served with the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division.Joslen, p. 83 Vickers machine-gun team of 2/8th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, man their weapon on a clifftop in Northern Ireland, 15 July 1941. In 1943, the 1/8th officially became the 8th Battalion as part of the MG Battalion attached to the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division during the Normandy Campaign during which they fought in the Battle for Caen. The 1st Battalion was part of an allied force which held out against overwhelming odds for 17 days during the Battle of Hong Kong before surrendering to the Imperial Japanese Army in December 1941.Beckett, p. 83 Post-war to amalgamation The regiment was reduced to a single regular battalion (the 1st) in 1948, and two territorial battalions (the 7th and 8th). The Kensington Regiment amalgamated with the Middlesex Yeomanry to form the 31st (Greater London) Signal Regiment (V). In 1948, the 1st battalion became part of the Home Counties Brigade, along with the regular battalions of other regiments in southeast England. From August 1950 to April 1951, the 1st battalion saw action in the Korean War as part of 27th British Commonwealth Brigade, being one of the first British units to be deployed there. In 1961 the Territorial Army was reduced in size and a new 5th Battalion was formed by the amalgamation of the 7th and 8th with the 571st Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery (the successor to the 9th Battalion). In 1966 the four battalions of the Home Counties Brigade were amalgamated to form a \\"large regiment\\", the Queen's Regiment. Accordingly, the 1st Battalion Middlesex Regiment was redesignated as 4th Battalion the Queen's Regiment (Middlesex), with the other regular battalions being formed by the Queen's Royal Surrey Regiment, Queen's Own Buffs and Royal Sussex Regiment. In 1968 the 'Middlesex' suffix was dropped, and in June 1970 the 4th Battalion was disbanded, with its members distributed among the regiment's three remaining regular batalions.

As its common name suggests, it is similar in appearance to the cookiecutter shark (I. brasiliensis) but has much larger lower teeth. This species reaches a maximum known length of . The largetooth cookiecutter shark feeds by gouging out chunks of flesh from larger animals, including bony fishes, sharks, and marine mammals, and is able to take larger bites than I. brasiliensis. Little is known of its life history; it is thought to be a weaker swimmer than I. brasiliensis, and is presumably aplacental viviparous like the rest of its family. This shark is an infrequent bycatch of commercial trawl and longline fisheries, but is not thought to be much threatened by these activities. Taxonomy The largetooth cookiecutter shark was originally described by Jack Garrick and Stewart Springer, in a 1964 issue of the scientific journal Copeia. Their description was based on a long adult female caught in a midwater trawl in the Gulf of Mexico, some south of Dauphin Island, Alabama. The specific epithet is derived from the Greek (\\"wealth\\" or \\"abundance\\") and (\\"tooth\\"). This species may also be referred to as the bigtooth or longtooth cookiecutter shark, or the Gulf dogfish. Distribution and habitat Much rarer than I. brasiliensis, only ten specimens of largetooth cookiecutter shark are known, caught from a handful of widely scattered localities: off Alabama in the United States, Bahia in Brazil, the Azores, and Western Sahara in the Atlantic Ocean, and off Okinawa and New South Wales in the Pacific. Those captures were made in the epipelagic zone down, close to land over continental shelves, continental slopes, or oceanic trenches that may descend as far as . The shark's rarity may be due to a restricted distribution or, more likely, it normally preferring deeper waters. Description The largetooth cookiecutter shark has a long, cigar-shaped body with an extremely short, blunt head and snout. The large, oval eyes are positioned to allow binocular vision, and are followed by wide, angled spiracles. The nostrils are small, each with a low, pointed skin lobe in front. The mouth is transverse, with a deep fold enclosing its corners and fleshy suctorial lips. The jaws are larger and more powerful than those of I. brasiliensis, and contain fewer tooth rows, numbering around 29 in the upper jaw and 19 in the lower jaw. The upper teeth are small, narrow, and smooth-edged, upright at the center of the jaw and becoming more angled towards the corners. The lower teeth are massive, the largest teeth relative to body size of any living shark. They are triangular in shape, with minutely serrated edges and interlocking rectangular bases. The five pairs of gill slits are minute. The small dorsal fins have rounded apices and are placed far back, on the last third of the body. The first dorsal fin originates slightly ahead of the pelvic fins, while the second dorsal originates closely behind and measures almost a third again the height of the first. The pectoral fins are small and rounded, and positioned relatively high on the body behind the fifth gill slit. The pelvic fins are tiny, and there is no anal fin. The caudal fin is very short, with the upper lobe twice as long as the lower and bearing a prominent ventral notch near the tip. The coloration is a plain dark brown, with translucent margins on the fins and sparsely scattered light-emitting photophores on the belly. Some specimens have lacked the dark \\"collar\\" found on the throat of I. brasiliensis. However, a specimen caught in 2004 off the Azores did possess the collar, and other freshly caught specimens also possess this trait, suggesting that the lack of a collar is an artifact of preservation. The maximum recorded length is . Biology and ecology Based on its smaller dorsal and caudal fins, the largetooth cookiecutter shark is believed to be less active than I. brasiliensis and an overall weak swimmer. Much of its body cavity is occupied by an enormous oil-filled liver, which allows it to maintain neutral buoyancy in the water column with little effort. Unlike I. brasiliensis, this shark possesses binocular vision, which may allow it to target its prey with greater precision. Virtually nothing is known of its biology; it is presumed to be aplacental viviparous. Like I. brasiliensis, the largetooth cookiecutter shark is an ectoparasite that feeds by excising plugs of flesh from larger animals. While I. brasiliensis is theorized to latch onto the surface of its prey and bite with a twisting motion, producing a circular wound containing spiral grooves inside from its lower teeth, the largetooth cookiecutter shark seems to employ a \\"sweeping\\" bite that produces a larger, more elongate (twice as long as the width of the mouth), oval wound containing parallel tooth grooves. This shark has been known to bite bony fishes, sharks, and marine mammals. One study has found that the largetooth cookiecutter shark is responsible for 80% of the cookiecutter wounds found on cetaceans off Bahia, Brazil. The flank was the most often-attacked area, followed by the head and abdomen. In at least three cases, bites to dolphins appeared to have resulted in their subsequent deaths by stranding. Another prey species in the area is the subantarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus tropicalis); at least two cases of juveniles fatally stranding after being bitten have also been recorded. Human interactions Other than possibly damaging billfishes or other valued species, the largetooth cookiecutter shark is of no import to commercial fisheries. All but one of the known specimens have been caught as bycatch in commercial trawls or longlines. However, given the infrequency of these catches and this species' probable wide distribution, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as of Least Concern.

The villa is located along the Riviera di Chiaia, the road bounding the north side of the Villa Comunale on the sea front between Mergellina and Piazza Vittoria. History and Decoration The villa was commissioned by admiral Ferdinand Acton in 1826 as a neo-classical residence that would be the centerpiece of a park. The design was completed by the architect Pietro Valente. The central atrium was moved to the front of the building and Doric columns still catch the eye of the viewer from the street away. The architect Guglielmo Bechi designed the interior decorations of the apartments and the marble entrance staircase. He recruited sculptors to complete the neoclassical depiction of Alcibides and the Hounds. The property has changed hands since construction: upon the death of Acton in 1841, it was bought by Carl Mayer von Rothschild of the German family of financiers. His monogram of CR can be seen in the first floor. For a time it was used by the Jewish community of Naples for services. In 1867, it was sold to the Duke of Monteleone, Diego Pignatelli Aragona Cortes, whose widow then willed it to the Italian state in 1952, with instructions that the house and its possessions not be altered. The villa maintains the gardens in front of the building, and houses a coach museum and a collection of French and English vehicles from the 18th and 19th centuries.

Design and development The C-295 is manufactured and assembled in the Airbus Defence and Space facilities in San Pablo Airport, located in Seville, Spain. It is a development of the Spanish‚ÄìIndonesian transport aircraft CASA/IPTN CN-235, but with a stretched fuselage, 50% more payload capability and new Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127G turboprop engines. CASA began development of the C-295 in November 1996, and the first prototype made its maiden flight on 28 November 1997. The first order for the C-295, from the Spanish Air Force for nine aircraft, was announced in April 1999. It was certificated as airworthy by the Spanish Direcci√≥n General de Aviaci√≥n Civil and the American Federal Aviation Administration in December 1999. Deliveries to the Spanish Air Force began in November 2001. In 2012, Airbus Military announced several enhancements to the base C-295 design, changes included the adoption of winglets and an ability to carry the Marte anti-ship missile; a dedicated airborne early warning and control variant was also planned. In November 2015, a C-295 successfully demonstrated a new self-protection suite, which incorporated elements such as directional infrared countermeasures from Elbit Systems and infrared passive airborne warning system.Egozi, Arie. \\"Music test protects C295 from missile threats.\\" Flight International, 25 November 2015. In January 2016, Airbus was in the process of developing a new probe-and-drogue aerial refuelling rig to be optionally installed in the centerline of the C295 for the aerial refuelling of combat helicopters. Initial 'dry' flight tests are scheduled later in the year. Airbus is also performing flap optimisations and other modifications upon the type for extremely short takeoff and landing capabilities.Drew, James. \\"PICTURES: Airbus to flight test new C295 aerial refuelling rig.\\" Flight International, 15 January 2016.

The highway splits from US 50 in Silver Springs, heading north to Fernley and then southeast to rejoin US 50 west of Fallon. Over the years, the route has held several numerical highway designations. Route description View west from the east end of US 50 Alt. Alternate US 50 begins in Silver Springs, at the junction of U.S. Route 50 and U.S. Route 95 Alternate. From there, the highway overlaps with US 95 Alt. for about as it heads north through Lyon County. Crossing over the Truckee Canal, US 50A/US 95A enter the city of Fernley on Commerce Way. Shortly afterwards, the two routes intersect State Route 427. As SR 427 heads west towards Interstate 80 and Wadsworth, US 50A/US 95A turn east to follow Main Street (old US 40) through Downtown Fernley. After approximately , the two routes intersect Farm District Road (State Route 828) at a roundabout on the east end of town. The junction is the site of the former split of the Victory and Lincoln Highways; US 95A turns northeast to join Interstate 80 (old US 40) along the old Victory Highway while US 50A heads southeast following the north branch of the Lincoln Highway. Outside of Fernley, Alternate US 50 travels about east to pass through the small community of Hazen. After that, the highway turns southeast and runs about more to its terminus with US 50 at the Leeteville Junction about west of downtown Fallon. History US 50 Alt/US 95 Alt southbound, overlooking Silver Springs and the junction of U.S. Route 50 :For history of US 50A between Silver Springs and Fernley, see U.S. Route 95 Alternate. The routing of US 50 Alternate between Fernley and Fallon dates back to the establishment of the Nevada's highway system. The road first became a numbered highway with the designation of State Route 2 in 1917, comprising the western end of the route. This highway had been paved by 1933. In 1940, the route received a second numerical designation when U.S. Route 95 was extended into Nevada. US 95 followed US 40 (State Route 1) southwest from Winnemucca to Fernley, then backtracked to Fallon along State Route 2 before heading south. The alignment of US 95 was changed to overlap State Route 1A north of Fallon in 1959, rendering the circuitous route through Fernley obsolete. The highway that had been US 95 between Fernley and Fallon was rechristened as U.S. Route 95 Alternate. This action resulted in two separate highways simultaneously carrying the US 95 Alternate designation, as present-day US 95A south of Fernley had been created years earlier. The dual instances of US 95A remained in place for several years. With Utah having discontinued its portions of US 50 Alternate in the early 1970s, Nevada officials were able to reassign the US 50A designation. Current US 50 Alternate came into existence around the time of Nevada's state highway renumbering in 1976. While the new number was posted along the road circa 1977 and first seen on Nevada's state highway map in the 1978 edition, the designation had yet to be formally approved. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO, which governs the assignment of U.S. Highway numbers) finally approved the routing at a highway numbering committee meeting held on April 25, 1997, nearly 20 years after US 50A was first signed. Other former routes of US 50 Alternate The current route of US 50 Alternate in Nevada is not the first alignment to bear the designation. The previous alignments are as follows: *An alternate route may have previously existed in Fallon when US 50 was routed along State Route 119 (Berney Road) and US 95. *US 50 Alternate was defined to run along what is now US 93 and US 93 Alternate between Ely and West Wendover. From there, it followed US 40 (now Interstate 80 east across the Great Salt Lake Desert in Utah, through Salt Lake City, south along US 91 (now Interstate 15) to rejoin US 50 south of Provo, Utah. This routing had been the former alignment of mainline US 50. Utah discontinued certain overlapping sections of US 50 Alternate in 1972.

The roadway was previously designated State Route 40 (SR 40), and the segment within the state park is currently designated a Nevada Scenic Byway. Route description Valley of Fire Road The western terminus of the Valley of Fire Road is at the Interstate 15 (I-15) exit 75, located at the former Crystal townsite within the Moapa River Indian Reservation approximately northeast of downtown Las Vegas. From there, the two-lane highway travels southeasterly about through open desert terrain towards the Muddy Mountains. The road begins to follow more a more hilly and curvaceous path as it meanders through the mountains. Around the 12-mile mark, the road officially enters the Valley of Fire State Park boundary and the scenic route begins, with the state park's west entrance station coming approximately east of there. Beyond the fee station, Valley of Fire Road traverses the southern reaches of the state park, passing nearby to various campgrounds, trails, the visitor center, and other points of interest. The mountainous landscape adjoining the highway becomes much more colorful, reflective of the terrain featured in the park. Valley of Fire Road spends roughly in the park before passing the east entrance station near Elephant Rock, where the scenic byway designation ends. The roadway reaches its eastern terminus east of there, at an intersection with Northshore Road within the Lake Mead National Recreation Area approximately south of Overton. Payment of a state park entrance fee is required to travel on Valley of Fire Road between the west and east entrance stations. As of September 2017, the entrance fee is 10 per vehicle for day use (Nevada residents may receive a 2 discount). History The Valley of Fire Road was designated SR 40 c. 1935-1976 A county road appearing in an approximately parallel alignment of the Valley of Fire Road appears on official state highway maps as early as 1933. However, the road proceeded much more easterly from U.S. Route 91 (US 91) and SR 6 at Crystal to connect to SR 12 near St. Thomas, bypassing north of the Valley of Fire. This roadway was marked as State Route 40 by 1935, and was shown along a route connecting Crystal more directly to Overton on SR 12, a distance of roughly . By 1941, SR 40 was moved to a new alignment that resembles the present-day alignment of the Valley of Fire Road‚Äîthe new routing was an unimproved, roadway traversing the southern side of the Valley of Fire State Park. The road was finally paved by 1964. In 1976, the Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT) began an effort to renumber its state highways. In this process, the SR 40 designation along Valley of Fire Road was proposed to be combined with SR 12 into a new State Route 169. This new highway designation was first seen on state highway maps in 1978. This action ultimately was not carried out, leaving the Valley of Fire Road without a state route number by 1982. However, as of 2020, the portion of Valley of Fire Road within the state park boundaries is still maintained by NDOT as a state park road. A section of the Valley of Fire Road‚Äîthe portion between the west and east entrances to the state park‚Äîwas designated a Nevada Scenic Byway on June 30, 1995.

Route description SR 398 on Main Street in Lovelock State Route 398 begins at interchange 106 with Interstate 80 (and concurrent U.S. Route 95) near the center of Lovelock. From here, the highway heads northwest under the freeway on Main Street towards the town. After crossing the Union Pacific Railroad tracks, the route intersects Cornell Avenue (I-80 Bus.) at the center of the city. Main Street at the intersection of Central Avenue at the steps to the Pershing County Courthouse; SR 398, however, follows Central Avenue through residential areas of the city. Exiting the city limits of Lovelock north of 16th Street, SR 398 becomes North Meridian Road. As the two-lane highway continues northward, houses gradually disappear in favor of the farm tracts of Upper Valley. The highway intersects Fairview Road, which it follows eastward. State Route 398 comes to an end at an intersection with Upper Valley Road (SR 396) northeast of Lovelock. History Part of SR 398 was originally State Route 66. The north-south segment of present-day State Route 398 appears on maps as early as 1937 in the form of State Route 66. SR 66 ran from State Route 1/U.S. Route 40 (now SR 396) approximately to its terminus at Fairview Road. SR 66 appears to have remained unchanged until the 1976 renumbering of Nevada's state highways on July 1, 1976. At that time, the highway was renumbered as State Route 398. The Fairview Road segment was likely added to the route during that process.

It is caused by metabolic consumption of oxygen. Description The term \\"oxygen window\\" was first used by Albert R. Behnke in 1967. Behnke refers to early work by Momsen on \\"partial pressure vacancy\\" (PPV) where he used partial pressures of oxygen and helium as high as 2‚Äì3 ATA to create a maximal PPV. Behnke then goes on to describe \\"isobaric inert gas transport\\" or \\"inherent unsaturation\\" as termed by LeMessurier and Hills and separately by Hills. who made their independent observations at the same time. Van Liew et al. also made a similar observation that they did not name at the time. The clinical significance of their work was later shown by Sass. The oxygen window effect in decompression is described in diving medical texts and the limits reviewed by Van Liew et al. in 1993. {border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"10\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" width=\\"90%\\" style=\\"background-color: #EEEEEE;\\" |----- |This passage is quoted from Van Liew's technical note: > When living animals are in steady state, the sum of the partial pressures of > dissolved gases in the tissues is usually less than atmospheric pressure, a > phenomenon known as the \\"oxygen window\\", \\"partial pressure vacancy\\" or > \\"inherent unsaturation\\".

Background Oxygen is used to decrease the time needed for safe decompression in diving, but the practical consequences and benefits need further research. Decompression is still far from being an exact science, and divers when diving deep must make many decisions based on personal experience rather than scientific knowledge. In technical diving, applying the oxygen window effect by using decompression gases with high ppO2 increases decompression efficiency and allows shorter decompression stops. Reducing decompression time can be important to reduce time spent at shallow depths in open water (avoiding dangers such as water currents and boat traffic), and to reduce the physical stress imposed on the diver. Mechanism The oxygen window does not increase the rate of offgassing for a given concentration gradient of inert gas, but it reduces the risk of bubble formation and growth which depends on the total dissolved gas tension. Increased rate of offgassing is achieved by providing a larger gradient. The lower risk of bubble formation at a given gradient allows the increase of gradient without excessive risk of bubble formation. In other words, the larger oxygen window due to a higher oxygen partial pressure can allow the diver to decompress faster at a shallower stop at the same risk, or at the same rate at the same depth at a lower risk, or at an intermediate rate at an intermediate depth at an intermediate risk. Application Use of 100% oxygen is limited by oxygen toxicity at deeper depths. Convulsions are more likely when the pO2 exceeds . Technical divers use gas mixes with high ppO2 in some sectors of the decompression schedule. As an example, a popular decompression gas is 50% nitrox on decompression stops starting at . Where to add the high ppO2 gas in the schedule depends on what limits of ppO2 are accepted as safe, and on the diver's opinion on the level of added efficiency. Many technical divers have chosen to lengthen the decompression stops where ppO2 is high and to at the shallower decompression stops. Nevertheless, much is still unknown about how long this extension should be and the level of decompression efficiency gained. At least four variables of decompression are relevant in discussing how long high ppO2 decompression stops should be: * Time needed for circulation and elimination of gas through the lungs; * The vasoconstrictor effect (reduction of the size of blood vessels) of oxygen, reducing decompression efficiency when blood vessels start contracting; * The threshold depth where the critical tissue compartments start off-gassing rather than in-gassing. * Cumulative effect of acute oxygen toxicity.

The Chintpurni shakti peeth (Chhinnamastika shakti peeth) is located in Una district Himachal Pradesh state, surrounded by the western Himalayas in the north and east in the smaller Shiwalik (or Shivalik) range bordering the state of Punjab. The Chintpurni Shakti Peeth houses the temple of Chinnamastika Devi or Chinnamasta Devi. Chhinnamasta or Chinnamastika temple is one of the 7 major and 51 total Shakti Peethas.Shakti Peethas Here, Chhinnamasta is interpreted as the severed-headed one as well as the foreheaded-one.Chhinnamasta Devi The Hindu genealogy registers at Chintpurni, Himachal Pradesh are kept here.  Ancient origin  When Lord Vishnu severed the burning body of Maa Sati into 51 pieces so that Lord Shiva would calm down and stop his Tandava, the pieces were scattered over various places in the Indian subcontinent. It is believed that Sati's head fell at this place and is thus considered one of the most important of the 51 Shakti Peethas. The goddess residing in Chintpurni is also known by the name of Chhinnamastika. According to Markandeya Purana, goddess Chandi defeated the demons after a fierce battle but two of her yogini emanations (Jaya and Vijaya) were still thirsty for more blood. Goddess Chandi cut off her own head to quench Jaya and Vijaya's thirst for more blood. She is usually shown holding her own severed head in her hand, drinking one stream of blood spurting from the arteries in her neck, while at her side are two naked yoginis, each of whom drinks another stream of blood. Chhinnamasta, the headless goddess, is the Great Cosmic Power who helps the sincere and devoted yogi to dissolve his or her mind, including all the preconceived ideas, attachments and habits into the Pure Divine Consciousness. Cutting off the head suggests the separation of the mind from the body, that is the freedom of the consciousness from the material confines of the physical body. According to Puranic traditions, Chhinnamastika Devi will be protected by Shiva ‚Äì Rudra Mahadev in the four directions. There are four Shiva temples ‚Äì Kaleshwar Mahadev in the east, Narayhana Mahadev in the west, Muchkund Mahadev in the north and Shiva Bari in the south ‚Äì which are nearly equidistant from Chintpurni. This also confirms Chintpurni as the abode of Chhinnamastika Devi.  The Chintpurni temple as a Shakti Peeth  Sati Devi The Chinnamastika Devi is a divine embodiment of self-sacrifice and there by the Chintpurni shri is considered as a Shakti Peetha. The mythology of Daksha yaga and Sati's self immolation is the mythology liked to the Shakti Peethas. Shakti Peethas are holy shrines of Shakti associated with a mythology that says about the falling of body parts of the corpse of Sati Devi, when Lord Shiva carried it and wandered in sorrow. There are 51 Shakti Peeth associated with the 51 alphabets in Sanskrit. It is believed that Sati Devi's feet fell here in this place  About the temple  Maa's durbar as seen from the havan kund, on leftThe temple dedicated to Mata Chintpurni Devi is located in Chintpurni village, Amb Tehsil of District Una ; Himachal Pradesh. Devotees have been visiting this Shaktipeeth for centuries to pray at the lotus feet of Mata Shri Chhinnamastika Devi They bring with them their worldly concerns and seek blessings from the Devi. It is believed that if one asks something from the Devi with an honest heart, the wish is granted. Apart from the holy shrine, some very picturesque places for sightseeing, indoor and outdoor activities are situated in and around Chintpurni. Chintpurni is very well connected through roads. One can come here for a religious visit, on a holiday or for both. People enjoy the time here and return with everlasting memories.  History  Pandit Mai Das, a nai, is generally believed to have established this shrine of Mata Chintpurni Devi in Chhaproh village about 12 generations ago. Over time this place became known as Chintpurni after the eponymous deity. His descendants still live in Chintpurni and perform prayers and puja at the Chintpurni temple. These descendants are the official priests at the Temple.

It is part of present-day Germany and Poland, specifically Western Pomerania and Farther Pomerania, stretching from the Peene River in the west to the Parsƒôta in the east. History From about 1156, the Griffin duke Bogus≈Çaw I, elder son of the first Pomeranian sovereign Wartislaw I, ruled in Pomerania around Szczecin. He fought against the Saxon duke Henry the Lion in the 1164 Battle of Verchen, was defeated, and became Henry's liensman. When in 1180 Henry was deposed by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, Bogus≈Çaw appeared at the emperor's camp near L√ºbeck and was enfeoffed with \\"Slavinia\\". The exact borders of the territory are unknown, as is its status as an Imperial estate. Four years later, Bogus≈Çaw had to submit to King Canute VI of Denmark. The term Duchy of Slavinia was sometimes used to denote the Griffin Duchy of Pomerania, located at the mouth of the Oder and ruled by the descendants of Duke Wartislaw I from the early 12th century, from the Pomerelian lands in the east under the rule of the Samborides initially as Polish vassals and also called \\"Duchy of Pomerania\\" at that time.\\"...A distinction was made between Slavinia, or modern [i.e., 1911] Pomerania, and Pomerellen\\" . The Griffin dukes remained under Danish overlordship until the 1227 Battle of Bornh√∂ved. Under the rule of Bogus≈Çaw's grandson Barnim I and his descendants during the Late Middle Ages, the Duchy of Pomerania was gradually Germanized culturally and linguistically, due to the immigration of German settlers in the course of the Ostsiedlung.

It prefers areas near rocks in water shallower than , but it also occurs deeper (not beyond the oxygen limit) and over a sandy or muddy bottom. Appearance and behavior The kampango is among the largest fish in the Lake Malawi basin, reaching up to about long,Konings, Ad (1990). Ad Konings' Book of Cichlids and all the other Fishes of Lake Malawi, p. 487. or possibly even . A common length is around and females are typically larger than males. Adults are overall blackish, while young are grey with dark spots. During the day kampangos hide in caves, but around dusk or dawn they hunt and eat their prey, primarily cichlids. Breeding The male digs a shallow nest in the sandy bottom, often near rocks, where the female lays several thousand eggs. After hatching, the young mostly eat trophic (unfertilized) egg that their mother lays, but they also take invertebrates that the father brings to them in his mouth.Stauffer, J.R., and Loftus, W.F. (2010). Brood Parasitism of a Bagrid Catfish (Bagrus meridionalis) by a Clariid Catfish (Bathyclarias nyasensis) in Lake Mala≈µi, Africa. Copeia 2010(1): 71-75. The eggs and young are fiercely guarded by the parents. The young kampango only leave the protection of their parents when around long, but before that most have typically already been eaten by egg- and fry-stealing cichlids like Mylochromis melanonotus and Pseudotropheus crabro. At other times Pseudotropheus crabro has a mutualistic relationship with the kampango, as it will clean it by feeding on parasites and dead tissue.ScotCat: Bagrus meridionalis G√ºnther, 1894. Retrieved 2 January 2019. Another catfish, Bathyclarias nyasensis, is a brood parasite of the kampango. Kampango parents have been observed taking care of entire broods of B. nyasensis young as if they were their own. As these broods almost exclusively contain B. nyasensis young, it is suspected that they hatch earlier than the kampango's own eggs and eat them. In contrast to the nest predators and parasites, certain cichlids, especially Copadichromis pleurostigmoides, Ctenopharynx pictus and Rhamphochromis, will release their young near nesting kampango. The kampango and cichlid parents both protect the mixed group, resulting in a significantly higher survival rate of the kampango young.McKaye, K.R. (1985). Cichlid‚Äìcatfish mutualistic defence of young in Lake Malawi, Africa. Oceologia 66: 358‚Äì363. Relationship with humans Kampango are highly prized as an eating fish, and are caught using nets and more commonly line caught, mainly in deep water around Cape Maclear, Salima, Mbenje Island, and Nkhata Bay. Fresh kampango are usually filleted and deep fried, barbecued, or cooked with tomato and onion as traditional Malawian dish, served with nsima. Traditionally regarded as one of the most widespread and common fish in its range, the kampango has declined drastically because of overfishing and is now considered critically endangered by the IUCN. From 2006 to 2016, its population declined by more than 90% based on the fall observed in catch rates in fisheries in southern Lake Malawi.

Background General Ren√© Schneider was Commander-in- chief of the Chilean Army at the time of the 1970 Chilean presidential election, in which Salvador Allende won a plurality on September 4, 1970, requiring a Congressional vote to declare a winner. At that time the prospect of Salvador Allende winning the Chilean presidency was highly controversial, particularly within the Chilean military, because of his Marxist ideology. In response to all the public calls that the military received to intervene in the electoral process and prevent Allende's election, General Schneider expressed a profound belief in the apolitical role of the military and a firm opposition to the idea of preventing Allende's inauguration by means of a coup d'√©tat. As a constitutionalist, he wished to preserve the military's apolitical role. Doctrine General Ren√© Schneider. He first enunciated this doctrine at a General Staff meeting on July 23, 1970. He wanted to make clear that \\"the armed forces are not a road to political power nor an alternative to that power. They exist to guarantee the regular work of the political system and the use of force for any other purpose than its defense constitute high treason\\". He reinforced his posture with a public message to the military on September 19, 1970, during the celebrations of Army day and in the midst of the campaign to obtain congressional ratification to Allende's marginal electoral victory, saying that \\"there were no options that would invite the armed forces to undo what the politicians had wrought in Chile\\".Cable Transmissions from US Ambassador to Chile, October 1, 1970 Nonetheless, he added a colophon: \\"the only limitation is in the case that the State stopped acting within their own legality. In that case the armed forces have a higher loyalty to the people and are free to decide an abnormal situation beyond the framework of the law\\". General Schneider was assassinated on October 24, 1970. His successor as Army Commander-in-chief, General Carlos Prats, became the spokesman for the \\"constitutionalists\\". Allende used this thesis as one of the bastions of his government, in order to keep the armed forces in line and prevent a possible coup d'√©tat against his government. After General Prats' resignation as Army Commander-in-chief, Allende appointed General Augusto Pinochet as Army Commander-in-Chief, and this thesis was replaced by the notion of \\"National Security\\", which, coupled with the Chamber of Deputies Resolution of August 22, 1973, led to the Chilean coup of 1973 on September 11, 1973.

Ferroelectret foams usually consist of a cellular polymer structure filled with air. Polymer-air composites are elastically soft due to their high air content as well as due to the size and shape of the polymer walls. Their elastically soft composite structure is one essential key for the working principle of ferroelectrets, besides the permanent trapping of electric charges inside the polymer voids. The elastic properties allow large deformations of the electrically charged voids. However, the composite structure can also possibly limit the stability and consequently the range of applications. How it works The most common effect related to ferroelectrets is the direct and inverse piezoelectricity, but in these materials, the effect occurs in a way different from the respective effect in ferroelectric polymers. In ferroelectric polymers, a stress in the 3-direction mainly decreases the distance between the molecular chains, due to the relatively weak van der Waals and electrostatic interactions between chains in comparison to the strong covalent bonds within the chain. The thickness decrease thus results in an increase of the dipole density and thus in an increase of the charges on the electrodes, yielding a negative d33 coefficient from dipole-density (or secondary) piezoelectricity. In cellular polymers (ferroelectrets), stress in the 3-direction also decreases the thickness of the sample. The thickness decrease occurs dominantly across the voids, the macroscopic dipole moments decrease, and so do the electrode charges, yielding a positive d33 (intrinsic or direct (quasi-)piezoelectricity). New features In recent years, alternatives to the cellular-foam ferroelectrets were developed. In the new polymer systems, the required cavities are formed by means of e.g. stamps, templates, laser cutting, etc. Thermo-forming of layer systems from electret films led to thermally more stable ferroelectrets.

A number of his works have survived in American and British collections, notably those of Ripley's Believe it or Not and the Sheffield Museum (the home town of the father of the Deakin Brothers of Yokohama, dealers in oriental art and curios in the 1890s). One such figure shows a naked Japanese man anatomically correct down to hairs inserted in his gofun skin, holding a small mask in his hand (i.e. a mask sculptor), about life-size. This was exhibited in San Francisco during about 1895-1906, and was depicted on a souvenir token from the Art Saloon, its owner at the time. It was reputed to be a self-portrait of the artist. Elaborations of the legend about this very lifelike image continued up through the time of the image's purchase by Ripley's in 1934,Robert Ripley would often put the statue in guest rooms at night in order to scare them.His house on B.I.O.N (Believe It Or Not) Island Had a slew of other strange collectibles including this. through its exhibit at the Chicago World's Fair in 1934, and into the present. The story below is a version of this romantic tale. Believing that he was dying from tuberculosis, Hananuma sculpted a life size statue of himself as a gift to the woman he loved, which was completed in 1885. The artist himself died 10 years later, in poverty aged 63. The statue is renowned for being nearly identical in appearance to its creator. Made of between 2000 and 5000 wooden strips (reports differ), it is connected only by dovetail joints, glue and wooden pegs. No joint is visible on the statue, and it is lacquered to show every detail of Hananuma, including muscle, bone and vein. The artist also manufactured anatomically correct glass eyeballs for the statue. Finally, individual holes were drilled in the statue to represent the pores of the skin, and the corresponding hair inserted. The statue was later purchased by Robert Ripley in 1934, and was housed in his California Odditorium until his death in 1949. After Ripley's death, the masterpiece toured various Odditoriums until it was stored in the Los Angeles Odditorium where it was damaged in the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The statue is currently on display in the Amsterdam Odditorium, located on Dam Square and a replica is in the London Odditorium, located at 1 Piccadilly Circus.

Until March 2009, Ives was Organist, Informator Choristarum and Fellow and Tutor in Music at Magdalen College, Oxford. In this role he was responsible for the daily musical life of the college chapel. He also directed the choir in recordings on the Harmonia Mundi label: With a Merrie Noyse, made with the viol consort Fretwork and featuring the works of the English composer Orlando Gibbons, was nominated for a Grammy in 2004. Paul McCartney's Ecce Cor Meum was written especially for Magdalen College Choir and the subsequent EMI recording won the Classical BRIT Award for Album of the Year in 2007. Other recordings with Magdalen College Choir include Listen Sweet Dove, a selection of Grayston Ives' liturgical works, and Durufl√©'s Requiem. The choir developed a fruitful relationship with film composer, George Fenton, notably in Shadowlands (1993), directed by Richard Attenborough. Ives was a chorister at Ely Cathedral and later studied music at Selwyn College, Cambridge, where he held a choral scholarship. After teaching music for a period, he became a member of the King's Singers, from 1978 to 1985. His voice can be heard on a number of recordings from that period, including Paul McCartney's Frog Chorus. Ives composes as Grayston, but prefers to be known as \\"Bill\\", a nickname he acquired at an early age as a result of a role-playing game with his brother. As a composer, Ives' work consists mainly of sacred and secular music for choir, much of it written for the liturgy at Magdalen College, Oxford. His \\"Canterbury Te Deum\\" (1991) for SATB and brass quintet was commissioned for the enthronement of George Carey as Archbishop of Canterbury. He was commissioned to compose the centre-piece anthem, \\"The Gift of Grace\\", for the National Commemoration Service for the Abolition of Slavery held in Westminster Abbey in March 2007. It was attended by Queen Elizabeth II and high-ranking politicians and public figures, including Tony Blair (British Prime Minister, 1997-2007). Westminster Abbey also commissioned three new arrangements of music by Parry for a new recording (released in Sept 2015): I was glad, Hear my words, ye people, and the Coronation Te Deum. For his contribution to church music, Ives was awarded a Fellowship of the Royal School of Church Music (May 2008) and a Lambeth DMus (July 2008), conferred by Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury.

For example, a person might be inclined: * to attribute negative judgements to neutral events or objects; * to believe something that has a positive emotional effect, that gives a pleasant feeling, even if there is evidence to the contrary; * to be reluctant to accept hard facts that are unpleasant and give mental suffering. Effect of dispositional emotionality Emotional bias is often the effect of dispositional emotionality that an individual has before the occurrence of events that could cause these emotions. These states were linked to the dysregulation in opioid receptor systems and are commonly known as temperament traits The examples are dispositional dysphoria, irritability, withdrawal, or dispositional good and relaxed moods. These dispositions create emotional biases in cognition. Studies of meaning attribution in 24 groups contrasted by various temperament traits showed that people with high neuroticism, high emotionality and weak endurance perceived neutral abstract concepts more negatively than people with low neuroticism and strong endurance.  Other effects Effects of emotional biases can be similar to those of a cognitive bias, it can even be considered as a subcategory of such biases. The specificity is that the cause lies in one's desires or fears, which divert the attention of the person, more than in one's reasoning. Neuroscience experiments have shown how emotions and cognition, which are present in different areas of the human brain, interfere with each other in decision making process, resulting often in a primacy of emotions over reasoning Emotional bias might help explain the tendency towards over-optimism or over-pessimism, even when evidence for a more rational conclusion is available. Decision making Emotions have a small to large impact on the decisions we make depending on the type of emotion. Some of the most influential emotions for decision-making are sadness, disgust, and guilt. Anger differs the most from fear and sadness in both judgment and decision- making contexts. Fear is associated with uncertainty, while sadness is associated with a perception that outcomes are due to the situation. Angry decision-makers tend to make choices quickly and are unlikely to analyze their decisions. Stress can play a role in decision-making. Acute stress can alter the response to moral dilemmas. On the other hand, stress does not always alter everyday, moral decision-making. One study looked at the role emotions play in adolescents' moral decision-making. In a hypothetical, prosocial behavioral context, positively charged self-evaluative emotions most strongly predict moral choice. In anti-social behaviors, negatively charged, critical emotions most strongly predict moral choice. Regret and disappointment are emotions experienced after a decision. In some cases, regret has created a stronger desire to switch choices than disappointment. Emotions affect different types of decisions. Emotions have a strong influence on economic behavior and decision-making. In some behavioral anomalies, certain emotions related to some tasks can have an increased impact. In one experiment, researchers looked at what emotions manifest the disposition effect, where individuals sell winning shares and hold losing ones. They found that elation for winners and regret for losers are necessary emotions that can cause the effect to occur. In regards to patients making a medical decision, emotions and one's motivational goals, play a part as well. One study looked at the elements of coping behaviors. The first two elements have to do with the need to control the cognitive and emotional elements of the health threat; the second pair of elements relate to the management of cognitive and emotional aspects of the decision itself. Brain damage can cause changes in normal decision-making processes. The amygdala is an area in the brain involved in emotion. Studies have found that patients with bilateral amygdala damage, which is damage in both hemispheres of the amygdala region in the brain, are deficient in decision-making. When an initial choice is made in decision- making, the result of this choice has an emotional response, which is controlled by the amygdala.

History The foundation was created when the two savings banks Sparebanken NOR (bank) and Gjensidige (insurance) merged to Gjensidige NOR and in 2002 became a public limited company and listed on Oslo Stock Exchange. The foundation was created to own part of the company to continue the tradition of customers of savings bank's owning part of the bank. When Gjensidige NOR merged with Den norske Bank in 2003 to form DnB NOR, the company retained an ownership in the newly created company. Cultural initiatives In addition to giving direct financial contributions, the Savings Bank Foundation invests in causes that benefit the general public. In 2005, they founded the instrument fund, Dextra Musica, with the aim to promote classical music. The fund owns a valuable collection of string instruments which have been placed at the disposal of Norwegian musicians. The foundation has made funds available to Norwegian museums to assist in art acquisitions. Since 1999, the foundation has spent ‚Ç¨400 million on acquiring art.https://news.artnet.com/art-world/art-industry-news- october-10-2019-1675171 In 2019, the foundation purchased Ernst Kirchner's 1915 painting Das Soldatenbad (English: The Artillerymen) for $22 million USD for the collection of the National Gallery of Oslo collection.

From there, the highway heads due east along Muller Lane, passing through farmlands and open fields. The route crosses over the west and east forks of the Carson River on its trek. After about , the route comes to an end at U.S. Route 395 just north of Minden. History SR 757 was originally part of the much longer State Route 19 SR 757 originally carried the designation of the longer State Route 19. That route, designated by 1929, connected a branch of State Route 3 (now U.S. Route 50) near South Lake Tahoe to California southeast of Gardnerville. The 1941 edition of Nevada's state highway map is the earliest to show this portion of the highway in its present alignment. The route was paved by 1948. Nevada started renumbering its state highways on July 1, 1976. At that time, the Muller Lane portion of SR 19 was reassigned to State Route 757. The new number was not shown on the official state map right away; the 1978-1979 edition of the state's tourist map continued to show SR 57 unchanged. The road was still shown on state maps without a route number in 1982. SR 757 was finally shown as a numbered highway on the 1991-1992 edition of the official state map.

Because one of the two escapees is Charlie \\"Bubber\\" Reeves (Redford), wrongly assumed to be responsible for a murder, the escape causes a stir in a nearby town full of drunks where Bubber is a well-known figure. The supporting cast features E. G. Marshall, Angie Dickinson, Janice Rule, Miriam Hopkins, Martha Hyer, Robert Duvall and James Fox. Plot In a small town in Tarl County, Texas, where banker Val Rogers (E. G. Marshall) wields a great deal of influence, word comes that native son Bubber Reeves (Robert Redford) and another man have escaped from prison. Sheriff Calder (Marlon Brando), who continues to believe in Bubber's innocence, expects him to return to his hometown, where Bubber's lonely wife Anna (Jane Fonda) is now involved in a romantic affair with Bubber's best friend, Val Rogers' son Jake (James Fox). Bubber is left on his own after the second fugitive kills a stranger for his car and clothes. The townspeople, conflicted about his guilt or innocence, socialize and drink heavily while awaiting Bubber's return. They include the hostile Emily Stewart (Janice Rule), who openly expresses her lust for Damon Fuller (Richard Bradford) in front of her husband, Edwin (Robert Duvall). As the drinking and quarreling intensify, a group of vigilantes demand action from Calder. When he defies them, they beat Calder brutally before the sheriff's loyal wife Ruby (Angie Dickinson) is able to get to his side. Bubber sneaks into town, hiding in an auto junkyard. Anna and Jake willingly set out to help him, and the townspeople follow, turning the event into a drunken revelry and setting the junkyard on fire, causing an explosion which mortally wounds Jake. A bloodied and beaten Calder manages to get to Bubber first but, while he is leading him up the steps into the jail, one of the vigilantes, Archie (Steve Ihnat), shoots Bubber multiple times with a gun hidden in his coat pocket. Sick of the town and its people, Calder and Ruby leave town the next morning. Cast * Marlon Brando as Sheriff Calder * Jane Fonda as Anna Reeves * Robert Redford as Charlie \\"Bubber\\" Reeves * E.

The movie is perhaps best known for a scene in which the sheriff played by Marlon Brando is brutally beaten by Richard Bradford, one of the three vigilantes; Brando later cited this scene as an example of Method acting. Paul Williams thought this movie would be his big break but, after working on the film for three months, he was shown on screen for a few moments and had \\"two lines\\" in the final film.Paul Williams interview. Songfacts. Retrieved July 9, 2007. Faye Dunaway auditioned for the film, but Jane Fonda was cast in the role of Anna Reeves. Following this, Arthur Penn tested Dunaway and cast her for Bonnie and Clyde, his next film. Reception On release, the film gained generally positive reviews from critics, but Richard Schickel was dismissive in Life magazine. Pointing out its origins in the Horton Foote play, he wrote: \\"The Chase is no longer a modest failure ... it has been turned into a disaster of awesome proportions\\".Richard Schickel \\"Small Flop Grows Into a Disaster\\", Life, 60:9, 4 March 1966, p.12 Rotten Tomatoes reports that 89% of critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 6.79/10. During an interview years after the film was released, Arthur Penn expressed his dissatisfaction with the film: \\"Everything in that film was a letdown, and I'm sure every director has gone through the same experience at least once.

There was an attempt to revive it by a new company between 1989 and 1994 in Alcester, Warwickshire. History The company was started by Noel Macklin who was looking for a new car making venture after he sold his Invicta company in 1933. The name came from Reid Railton, the world speed record car designer, but his input was probably small although he did receive a royalty on each car sold. 1933 - Railton Terraplane The first car was made by fitting a British body made by coachbuilder John Charles Ranalah to a 4010 cc, 100 bhp, 8-cylinder Hudson Terraplane chassis. Described as a pre-war Shelby Cobra, Special Interest Autos April, 1985 the resulting machine was at first available as a two-door tourer. Being lighter than the original, it had for the time exceptional performance, with a 0‚Äì60 mph time of 13 seconds. A saloon-bodied version was soon added to the range, and the cars were priced at ¬£499. 1935 - Railton 8 In 1935 the original Terraplane chassis was replaced by the one from the Hudson Eight, the engine grew to 4168 cc producing 113 bhp,THE RAILTON TERRAPLANE ON THE ROAD, Motor Sport Magazine Page 13, October 1934 and a wider range of bodies from several coachbuilders were on offer from at least seven different vehicle coachbuilders including; Ranalah, R.E.A.L, Carbodies and Coachcraft Ltd. Two special lightweight models were made in 1935 and, with a 0‚Äì60 time of 8.8 seconds, were claimed to be the fastest production cars in the world. Altogether 1379 of the Railton 8s were made. 1937 - Railton Cobham A smaller six-cylinder car, the 16.9 was added in 1937 using a 2723 cc Hudson 6-cylinder engine and chassis, but only 81 were made in saloon or drophead coup√© form and priced at ¬£399. 1938 - Railton 8 An even smaller Railton, the 10 hp, joined the range in 1938 built on a Standard Flying Nine chassis and with either saloon or drophead coup√© bodywork was claimed to be \\"A famous name in miniature\\". 51 were made selling at ¬£299. In 1938 Motor Sport tested a 28.8 h.p. Railton Cobham saloon, FPH 970, offered for sale at ¬£698.Motor Sport, September 1938, Pages 321-322. 1939 - demise Noel Macklin turned his attention to powerboats in 1939, and he sold the company to Hudson Motor Car Company of Detroit, Michigan, who transferred production to their Brentford, London works. However, the outbreak of war in 1939 stopped production. After World War II a few cars were completed using pre-war parts, and a new model was built and shown at the 1949 London Motor Show. However, at nearly ¬£5000 the car was incredibly expensive, and it never went into production.  1989 - Railton revival  The name was revived by a new company called Railton Motor Company, founded in 1989 in Wixford, Warwickshire. Two convertible models, the F28 Fairmile and the F29 Claremont were announced. Both were styled by William Towns and were based on Jaguar XJS running gear with new original aluminium bodywork. Production seems to have stopped in about 1994. British motoring journalist Paul Walton has written about the Railton F28 Fairmile.

He articled in law with his cousin, Denis-Benjamin Viger, was admitted to the bar in 1807 and set up practice in Montreal. Viger was a member of the local militia and served as a lieutenant during the War of 1812. In 1824, he married Marie-Ermine, daughter of Louis Turgeon, seigneur of Beaumont. In 1830, he was elected to represent Chambly in the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada as a member of the parti patriote and voted for the Ninety-Two Resolutions. He was elected again in 1834. In 1835, in partnership with Jacob De Witt, he set up La Banque du Peuple to counter the Bank of Montreal's monopoly in the province. Because he had played an important role in protest meetings organized before the Lower Canada Rebellion, Viger was arrested in November 1837 and charged with treason. He was released in August 1838 and then jailed again for a short time later that same year. Viger protested against the union of Lower Canada and Upper Canada into the Province of Canada in 1841 and the irregularities in the elections that followed.

The Democratic and Republican primary elections were held in March, which included a total of 15 candidates who combined to spend a record total of over $60 million seeking the open seat. On March 16, 2004, State Senator Barack Obama won the Democratic primary, and businessman Jack Ryan won the Republican primary. Three months later, Ryan announced his withdrawal from the race four days after the Chicago Tribune persuaded a California court to release records from Ryan's divorce case, which included allegations that Ryan had pressured his then-wife actress Jeri Ryan to perform sexual acts in public. Six weeks later, the Illinois Republican State Central Committee chose former Diplomat Alan Keyes to replace Ryan as the Republican candidate.

Barack Obama, a member of the Illinois Senate since 1997 and an unsuccessful 2000 Democratic primary challenger to four-term incumbent U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush for Rush's U.S House seat, launched a campaign committee at the beginning of July 2002 to run for the U.S. Senate, 21 months before the March 2004 primary, and two months later had David Axelrod lined up to do his campaign media. Obama formally announced his candidacy on January 21, 2003, four days after former U.S. Sen. Carol Moseley Braun announced she would not seek a rematch with U.S. Sen. Peter Fitzgerald. On April 15, 2003, with six Democrats already running and three Republicans threatening to run against him, incumbent Fitzgerald announced he would not seek a second term in 2004, and three weeks later popular Republican former Governor Jim Edgar declined to run, leading to wide open Democratic and Republican primary races with 15 candidates, including 7 millionaires (triggering the first application of the Millionaires' Amendment of the 2002 McCain‚ÄìFeingold Act), in the most expensive Senate primary in U.S. history. Obama touted his legislative experience and early public opposition to the Iraq War to distinguish himself from his Democratic primary rivals. Illinois Comptroller Dan Hynes won the endorsement of the AFL-CIO. Obama succeeded in obtaining the support of three of the state's largest and most active member unions: AFSCME, SEIU, and the Illinois Federation of Teachers. Hynes and multimillionaire former securities trader Blair Hull each won the endorsements of two of the nine Democratic Illinois members of the US House of Representatives. Obama had the endorsements of four: Jesse Jackson, Jr., Danny Davis, Lane Evans, and Jan Schakowsky. Obama surged into the lead after he finally began television advertising in Chicago in the final three weeks of the campaign, which was expanded to downstate Illinois during the last six days of the campaign. The ads included strong endorsements by the five largest newspapers in Illinois‚Äîthe Chicago Tribune, Chicago Sun-Times, Daily Herald, The Rockford Register Star, and Peoria Journal Star‚Äîand a testimonial by Sheila Simon that Obama was \\"cut from that same cloth\\" as her father, the late former U.S. Senator Paul Simon, who had planned to endorse and campaign for Obama before his unexpected death in December 2003.  Results  On March 16, 2004, Obama won the Democratic primary by an unexpected landslide‚Äîreceiving 53% of the vote, 29% ahead of his nearest Democratic rival, with a vote total that nearly equaled that of all eight Republican candidates combined‚Äîwhich overnight made him a rising star in the national Democratic Party, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir, Dreams from My Father.

Wright, former State Representative  Campaign  GOP frontrunner Jack Ryan had divorced actress Jeri Ryan in 1999, and the records of the divorce were sealed at their mutual request. Five years later, when Ryan's Senate campaign began, the Chicago Tribune newspaper and WLS-TV, the local ABC affiliate, sought to have the records released. On March 3, 2004, several of Ryan's GOP primary opponents urged Ryan to release the records.Fornek, Scott; Herrmann, Andrew. ‚ÄúSenate rivals urge Ryan to unseal divorce records‚Äù, Chicago Sun-Times (March 4, 2004). Both Ryan and his wife agreed to make their divorce records public, but not make the child custody records public, claiming that the custody records could be harmful to their son if released. Ryan went on to win the GOP primary on March 16, 2004 defeating his nearest competitor, Jim Oberweis, by twelve percentage points.Davey, Monica. ‚ÄúFrom Crowded Field, Democrats Choose State Legislator to Seek Senate Seat‚Äù (March 17, 2004). Ryan was a proponent of across-the- board tax cuts and tort reform, an effort to limit payout in medical malpractice lawsuits. He was also a proponent of school choice and supported vouchers for private school students. Oberweis's 2004 campaign was notable for a television commercial where he flew in a helicopter over Chicago's Soldier Field, and claimed enough illegal immigrants came into America in a week (10,000 a day) to fill the stadium's 61,500 seats. Oberweis was also fined $21,000 by the Federal Election Commission for a commercial for his dairy that ran during his 2004 Senate campaign. The FEC ruled that the commercial wrongly benefited his campaign and constituted a corporate contribution, thus violating campaign law.cbs2chicago.com - Oberweis Fined For Funding Campaign With Dairy Ad  Results   General election   Obama vs. Ryan  As a result of the GOP and Democratic primaries, Democrat Barack Obama was pitted against Republican Jack Ryan. Ryan trailed Obama in early polls, after the media reported that Ryan had assigned Justin Warfel, a Ryan campaign worker, to track Obama's appearances. The tactic backfired when many people, including Ryan's supporters, criticized this activity. Ryan's spokesman apologized, and promised that Warfel would give Obama more space. Obama acknowledged that it is standard practice to film an opponent in public, and Obama said he was satisfied with Ryan's decision to have Warfel back off. As the campaign progressed, the lawsuit brought by the Chicago Tribune to open child custody files from Ryan's divorce was still continuing. Barack Obama's backers emailed reporters about the divorce controversy, but refrained from on-the-record commentary. On March 29, 2004, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert Schnider ruled that several of the Ryans' divorce records should be opened to the public, and ruled that a court-appointed referee would later decide which custody files should remain sealed to protect the interests of Ryan's young child.Ford, Liam. ‚ÄúSome Ryan divorce files should be unsealed‚Äù, Chicago Tribune (March 30, 2004). A few days later, on April 2, 2004, Barack Obama changed his position about the Ryans' soon-to-be-released divorce records, and called on Democrats to not inject them into the campaign.Fornek, Scott. \\"Obama: Back off divorce files\\", Chicago Sun-Times (April 3, 2004). On June 22, 2004, after receiving the report from the court appointed referee, the judge released the files that were deemed consistent with the interests of Ryan's young child. In those files, Jeri Ryan alleged that Jack Ryan had taken her to sex clubs in several cities, intending for them to have sex in public. The decision to release the files generated much controversy because it went against both parents' direct request, and because it reversed the earlier decision to seal the papers in the best interest of the child. Jim Oberweis, Ryan's defeated GOP opponent, commented that \\"these are allegations made in a divorce hearing, and we all know people tend to say things that aren't necessarily true in divorce proceedings when there is money involved and custody of children involved.\\" Although their sensational nature made the revelations fodder for tabloid and television programs specializing in such stories, the files were also newsworthy because of questions about whether Ryan had accurately described the documents to GOP party leaders. Prior to release of the documents, Ryan had told leading Republicans that five percent of the divorce file could cause problems for his campaign.Martinez, Michael; Pearson, Rick. ‚ÄúCourt sets release of Ryan's divorce file‚Äù, Chicago Tribune (June 18, 2004). But after the documents were released, GOP officials including state GOP Chair Judy Baar Topinka said they felt Ryan had misleadingly indicated the divorce records would not be embarrassing.Pearson, Rick; Ford, Liam. ‚ÄúGOP leaders say they felt misled on Ryan file‚Äù, Chicago Tribune (June 23, 2004). That charge of dishonesty led to intensifying calls for Ryan's withdrawal, though Topinka, who was considering running herself, said after the June 25 withdrawal that Ryan's \\"decision was a personal one\\" and that the state GOP had not pressured Ryan to drop out.Ford, Liam; Bush, Rudolph. ‚ÄúRyan Quits Race‚Äù, Chicago Tribune June 26, 2004. Ryan's campaign ended less than a week after the custody records were opened, and Ryan officially filed the documentation to withdraw on July 29, 2004. Obama was left without an opponent.  Obama vs. Keyes  The Illinois Republican State Central Committee chose former diplomat Alan Keyes to replace Ryan as the Republican candidate after former governor Jim Edgar, state treasurer Judy Baar Topinka, and former Chicago Bears head coach Mike Ditka declined to run. Keyes, a conservative Republican, faced an uphill battle. First, as a native of Maryland, he had almost no ties to Illinois. Second, he had an unsuccessful electoral track record, losing two races for U.S. Senate in Maryland by landslides and making unsuccessful bids for the Republican presidential nomination in 1996 and 2000. Third, Keyes's lack of electoral momentum enabled Obama to focus on campaigning in more conservative downstate regions, an unusual move for an Illinois Democrat. Media were angered by what they considered Keyes's parachute candidacy. The Chicago Tribune published a scathing editorial, calling him \\"[t]he GOP's rent-a-senator\\" and sarcastically listing basic facts about local geography for a candidate they suspected had no familiarity with the area: \\"Keyes may have noticed a large body of water as he flew into O'Hare. That is called Lake Michigan. It's large. It's wide. It's deep. And we'll spoil the surprise: You can't even see across it.\\" In a similar vein, The New York Times published an editorial decrying \\"the rank hypocrisy\\", recalling that four years earlier, Keyes had attacked Hillary Clinton for establishing residency in New York for the first time only two months before announcing her U.S. Senate candidacy in that state. Keyes attacked Barack Obama for voting against a bill that would have outlawed a form of late-term abortion. Race became an issue in the contest between the two black candidates when Keyes claimed that he, not Obama, was the true \\"African-American\\". Indeed there were a handful of black spokesmen who did not consider Obama to be African-American. The black voters of Illinois voted 92% for Obama. Obama ran the most successful Senate campaign in 2004, and was so far ahead in polls that he soon began to campaign outside of Illinois in support of other Democratic candidates. He gave large sums of campaign funds to other candidates and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and sent many of his volunteers to work on other races, including that of eventual three-term Congresswoman Melissa Bean who defeated then-Congressman Phil Crane in that year's election. Obama and Keyes differed on many issues including school vouchers and tax cuts, both of which Keyes supported and Obama opposed.Alan Keyes Archives, 2004 Illinois Debates  Results  The Obama- Keyes race was one of the first to be called on Election Day, November 2, 2004. At the start of Keyes' candidacy in August, Keyes had 24% support in the polls. He received 27% of the vote in the November general election to Obama's 70%. Following the election, Keyes refused to call Obama to congratulate him. Media reports claimed that Keyes also failed to concede the race to Obama. Two days after the election, a radio interviewer asked Keyes whether he had conceded the race. Keyes replied, \\"Of course I've conceded the race. I mean, I gave my speech to that effect.\\" On the radio program, Keyes explained that his refusal to congratulate Obama was \\"not anything personal,\\" but was meant to make a statement against \\"extend[ing] false congratulations to the triumph of what we have declared to be across the line.\\" He said that Obama's position on moral issues regarding life and the family had crossed that line. \\"I'm supposed to make a call that represents the congratulations toward the triumph of that which I believe ultimately stands for... a culture evil enough to destroy the very soul and heart of my country? I can't do this. And I will not make a false gesture,\\" Keyes said. Obama would go on to be elected President of the United States in 2008.

It has been described as \\"part murder mystery, part social criticism\\" by The Review of Contemporary Fiction. The Stolen Spring's main theme is the solidarity of a group of boys in a school with harsh discipline. This, alongside other factors, makes the book stand out as being very socialist in its message. It is highly critical of the Danish educational system in the 20th century, a system Scherfig himself was a product of, and it is considered to be broadly based on some of his own experiences as a student at Metropolitanskolen. Reception The Stolen Spring is considered a very important part of the Danish literary heritage by various experts and writers. It is not featured in the new Danish Culture Canon. Some have speculated that the socialist message of the book may have been the deciding reason for this. However, other socialist works have been placed on the canon, e.g. the films Ditte Menneskebarn and Pelle the Conqueror both based on books by Martin Andersen Nex√∏.

It lies on the main north-south ridge of the Far Eastern Fells between Loadpot Hill and High Raise. Lesser ridges also radiate out to the east and north-west. Topography North of Wether Hill, across a broad depression, is Loadpot Hill, the height of the two being almost equal. Flowing east from this col is Howe Grain, a feeder of Cawdale Beck. This in turn flows through a U-shaped valley and finally ‚Äì renamed Howes Beck ‚Äì passes through Bampton to the Lowther. Between Cawdale Beck and the Haweswater catchment further south runs Wether Hill's three mile eastern ridge. This begins at High Kop on the summit plateau and then narrows to form the subsidiary height of Low Kop (1,876 ft). From here a spur runs north east down The Hause into Cawdale. The east ridge however continues over Bampton Fell to a series of rocky tops above the northern shore of Haweswater. Among these are Four Stones Hill (complete with standing stones), Great and Little Birkhouse Hills and Pinnacle How, before the high ground peters out at Haweswater Beck. South of Wether Hill the main ridge narrows before climbing to Red Crag, an outlier of High Raise. Flowing east from this depression are the feeders of Measand Beck. This runs below Low Kop and Bampton Fell, entering Haweswater halfway along the northern edge. Before the raising of the lake, silt carried down Measand Beck formed The Straits, a narrow waist between the two halves of the original lake.G Berry: Mardale Revisited, Westmorland Gazette (1996): The area was farmed from Measand Beck Hall, now submerged. The western face of Wether Hill falls steeply into Rampsgill, part of the Martindale valley system, with some broadleaved plantations at the base. Partway down the slope is the protuberance of Gowk Hill (1,545 ft). This is a round grassy dome from which a rocky spur descends northwards over Brownthwaite Crag and Steel Knotts. Enclosed between this and Loadpot Hill is the little valley of Fusedale. Summit The grassy top of Wether Hill has two summits of similar height. The southern is broader, but the northern top bears a cairn and is the traditional summit.Alfred Wainwright:A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 2: High Kop and the start of the east ridge fall from the south summit. The Roman road (High Street), which runs along the north-south ridge, narrowly avoids both tops. There are good views west to the Helvellyn range and a wide vista toward the Pennines in the opposite direction. Ascents Ascents from Martindale can be made via Steel Knotts or Fusedale. From Haweswater (Burnbanks) the approach can be made via Measand Beck or the east ridge. The east ridge can also be gained halfway along via The Hause from Bampton. Wether Hill is often also climbed incidentally from the Roman road while passing along the main ridge from High Raise to Loadpot Hill.

San Miguel is the county seat of San Miguel Partido, and has been a part of Greater Buenos Aires since the early 2000s. The number of inhabitants was 157,532 according to the 2001 census. Part of a vast estancia estate owned by General √Ångel Pacheco, San Miguel was founded as San Jos√© del Pilar by a French Argentine agronomist, Adolfo Sourdeaux, on May 18, 1864. Part of Pilar Partido initially, the town was renamed San Miguel after the former district was subdivided shortly afterward. A Buenos Aires- Pacific Railway line was built along the town in 1870, and its first schools were opened at that time as part of President Domingo Sarmiento's program for education in Argentina. The town was designated as county seat for the newly created General Sarmiento Partido in 1889, and was in turn made the county seat for San Miguel Partido when the former was subdivided in 1994. San Miguel's transition from a rural community to that of a suburban bedroom community with high-rise buildings has caused it to lose its village character and strained its infrastructure. The largely service-oriented economy is complemented by industries such as the IPH steel cable facility. Cable television provider TeleRed broadcasts from San Miguel, covering audiences in most of the Greater Buenos Aires. Its programming includes a local Catholic channel, Se√±al Santa Mar√¨a, which offers family-friendly content plus religious programmes, mostly from EWTN. San Miguel is home to a number of educational institutions, including the National University of General Sarmiento and the parochial Colegio M√°ximo de San Jos√©, from which Jorge Bergoglio (the future Pope Francis) obtained a degree in philosophy. San Miguel has numerous bus lines running through the center and is served with several stations by the San Martin and Urquiza commuter railroad lines, which provide easy access to Buenos Aires.

In December 2009, the district administration reported that 262 pupils, or 16.2% of the district's pupils, received special education services. In 2008, the district reported that 16.9% of its pupils received special education services. The district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the Special Education Department. The IDEA 2004 requires each school entity to publish a notice to parents, in newspapers or other media, including the student handbook and website regarding the availability of screening and intervention services and how to access them. Students who have an Individual Education Plan (IEP) may take the PSSA-M an alternative math exam rather than the PSSA.Eleanor Chute., Modified PSSA test in math offered for 1st time, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, April 18, 2010 Some special education students may take the PASA (Pennsylvania Alternate System of Assessment), rather than the PSSA. Schools are permitted to provide accommodations to some students. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Browne, Patrick., Senate Education Committee Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability testimony, November 1, 2011 Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.Kintisch, Baruch., Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Education Law Center, November 11, 2011 The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive requiring schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports. Lakeland School District received a $864,115 supplement for special education services in 2010. Special education funding was the same for 2011-12, 2012‚Äì13 and 2013‚Äì14 school years. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. For the 2014-2015 school year, Lakeland School District received an increase to $877,880 from the Commonwealth for special education funding even though the number of students receiving special education services had significantly declined.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Special Education funding report by LEA, July 2014 Gifted education The District Administration reported that 30 or 1.8% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Through the strategic planning process, the Superintendent must ensure that Lakeland School District provides a continuum of program and service options to meet the needs of all mentally gifted students for enrichment, acceleration, or both. Bullying Policy The Lakeland School Administration reported two incidents of bullying occurring in the schools in 2010. There was also one incident of sexual harassment. The school board prohibits bullying by district students and employees. The board directs that complaints of bullying shall be investigated promptly, and corrective action shall be taken when allegations are verified. No reprisals or retaliation shall occur as a result of good faith reports of bullying. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. District administration are required to annually provide the following information with the district's Safe School Report: the board's bullying policy, a report of bullying incidents in the school district, and information on the development and implementation of any bullying prevention, intervention or education programs. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days‚Äô public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, June 27, 2006 In 2013, the average teacher salary in Lakeland School District was $55,832 a year.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Investing in Pennsylvania Students, 2013 The district employed 116 teachers with a top salary of $110,000. Pennsylvania teacher salaries (2013‚Äì14) are searchable in a statewide database provided by TribLive News. Lakeland School District teacher and administrator retirement benefits are equal to at least 2.00% x Final Average Salary x Total Credited Service. (Some teachers benefits utilize a 2.50% benefit factor.) After 40 years of service, Pennsylvania public school teachers and administrators can retire with 100% of the average salary of their final 3 years of employment. According to a study conducted at the American Enterprise Institute, in 2011, public school teachers‚Äô total compensation is roughly 50 percent higher than they would likely receive in the private sector. The study found that the most generous benefits that teachers receive are not accounted for in many studies of compensation including: pension, retiree health benefits and job security. In 2014-15, Pennsylvania public school district mandated teacher pension contribution rose to 21.40% of employee salaries and in 2015-16 it rose again to 25.84% of total salaries. In 2014-15, the state mandated district contribution to the teacher pension fund rose to 21.40% of employee salaries and in 2015-16 it rose again to 25.84% of total district salaries.

Pennsylvania public school district reserve funds are divided into two categories ‚Äì designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, CentreDaily Times, September 22, 2010 In 2005, the total reserve funds held by Pennsylvania public school districts was $1.9 billion.

Several findings were reported to the school board and administration. The auditors noted that the district did not take appropriate corrective action regarding erroneous reports and that the transportation department had made some possible Conflict of Interest transactions. The Superintendent and School Board took no action pending a state investigation. In 2011, the transportation director plead guilty to conspiracy to obtain by fraud school district funds. In 2010, the state Ethics Commission fined the transportation director $49,529.20. The order from the commission alleged he steered almost $450,000 in van contracts to his live-in girlfriend. Tuition Students who live in the Lakeland School District's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Lakeland School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the district's schools. The 2014 tuition rates are Elementary School - $7,577.88, High School - $9,756.29. Lakeland School District is funded by a combination of: a local tax on income 0.5%, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. Grants have provided an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. Interest earnings on accounts also provide nontax income to the district. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension income and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the level of the individual's personal wealth. The average Pennsylvania public school teacher pension in 2011 exceeded $60,000 a year, plus they receive federal Social Security benefits. Both retirement benefits are free of Pennsylvania state income tax and local income tax which funds local public schools. Effective 2016, active duty military are also exempted from paying the local earned income tax in Pennsylvania. State basic education funding According to a report from Representative Todd Stephens office, Lakeland School District receives 47.5% of its annual revenue from the state.

Districts are not permitted to raise taxes above that index, unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the Pennsylvania Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines.

They, along with the Manchester Pals, are commemorated at a small memorial in France. Recruitment The volunteers were initially sought at The Kings Regiment Liverpool HQ in St Anne Street on 28 August 1914, and were addressed by Lord Derby, who said: > I am not going to make you a speech of heroics. You have given me your > answer, and I can telegraph to Lord Kitchener tonight to say that our second > battalion is formed.

But I do thank you from the bottom of my heart > for coming here tonight and showing what is the spirit of Liverpool, a > spirit that ought to spread through every city and every town in the > kingdom. Businesses had been asked to encourage their staff to enlist, and the volunteers were drawn from city offices and factories. Although similar events were held elsewhere, recruitment in Liverpool was said to be particularly strong. The numbers attending were far greater than anticipated, and extra rooms were opened up in order to enlist them. By November, enough volunteers had come forward to form four battalions. Barracks were created on disused sites at Prescot, Hooton, Sefton Park and Knowsley Park before further training on Salisbury Plain. They left for France in late 1915, and took part in some of the fiercest battles of the war, with heavy loss of life. Almost 200 of the Liverpool Pals were killed in one day, 1 July 1916, in the Battle of the Somme. At the end of the war, about 20% of the volunteers had been killed, and a further 50% injured.

In 2003, as part of a wider investigation into alleged fee fixing at UK independent schools, the Office of Fair Trading published an e-mail exchange between the bursars of Rugby Group schools containing detailed information about planned fee levels at each of the schools. The case was settled in 2006, with 50 schools admitting that such exchange of information \\"involved a distortion of competition and infringed competition law\\", but not admitting to any effect on fees. The schools each paid a ¬£10,000 penalty, and agreed to make ex gratia payments totalling ¬£3 million to a trust to benefit pupils attending the schools in the relevant years.

The memorial was commissioned by the Norwegian Parliament after World War I to commemorate the fallen Norwegian sailors of the war. It was unveiled by King Haakon VII and was later converted to the national monument commemorating fallen sailors of both World War I and World War II. The monument itself is a pyramid of locally quarried rock and is designed by two architects from Oslo, Andreas Hesselberg Bjercke (1883-1967) and Georg Christen Eliassen (1880-1964).

Hubbard & Co.', Russian Merchants. He was by profession a banker, his family had a business in St Petersburg, which was not strictly commercial, but had an operation in London. It was enough for him to become a director of Guardian Fire and Life Assurance Co. In 1838 he joined the elite as a director of the Bank of England, later rising to become successively Deputy Governor and then Governor. Convinced capital and income should be treated differently he lobbied parliament to recognise the legal treatment of income tax on earned income only, which was eventually achieved in 1907. He was of Chairman of the Public Works and Exchequer Loan Committee between 1853 and 1875. Hubbard was deeply interested in religion and the High Church in the Puseyite tradition, yet he rejected ritualism. In 1863 he built and endowed St Alban's Church, Holborn, where he was also churchwarden.Bernard Palmer, Reverend Rebels: Five Victorian Clerics and their Fight Against Authority, (London, Darton, Longman & Todd, 1993), pp. 78ff.

He was invested as a Privy Counsellor in 1874. Hubbard died at Addington Manor, Buckinghamshire, at the age of 84. Hubbard married Hon.

He effectively refounded the school using his acumen to raise the fees, boost numbers, and fund the debts. In the same year that he was elevated to the peerage, the school paid the last installment.

Philip had reached adulthood by the end of the 1190s. His father married him to his ward, Amelia, the heiress of Cognac, France, in Charente. However, when she died without issue, Richard kept the castle, and handed it over to his seneschal, Robert of Thornham.\\"Comptes d'Alfonse de Poitiers\\", Archives historiques du Poitou, vol. 4, p. 21. The king was mortally wounded during the suppression of a revolt by Viscount Aimar V of Limoges in 1199, and died without legitimate heirs. The chronicler Roger of Howden claimed that later that same year, No other source corroborates this, or explicitly indicates that Aimar of Limoges's death was a violent one. However, Guiraut de Bornelh's planh (lament) for him, Planc e sospir, does suggest his death was unexpected. A further reference to Philip is found in the Pipe Rolls for 1201 of his uncle, John, King of England: \\"Et Philippo f. R. Ricardi 1 m. de dono R.\\" (\\"And to Philip, son of King Richard, one mark as a gift\\"), but nothing later. It seems likely that he died early in the 13th century, although it may be that he acquired a new territorial designation (Cognac having been the territory of his late wife), perhaps through re-marriage, which has blurred the trail of documentary evidence. Philip in fiction, drama and film The sparsely-documented historical Philip of Cognac has been developed in literature. William Shakespeare depicted him as Philip the Bastard in his play, The Life and Death of King John. In this, he is the son of Lady Faulconbridge, widow of Sir Robert Faulconbridge, and learns of his true paternity in the first scene: :Madam, I would not wish a better father. :He that perforce robs lions of their hearts :May easily win a woman's. However, as mentioned above, nothing is known of the real Philip's mother. Shakespeare's character is essentially a fictional creation, who shares only a name and a father with his historical counterpart. Another highly fictionalised version of Philip, played by Stephen Moyer, figures as the romantic hero of Princess of Thieves (2001), a made-for-TV Disney adventure for young viewers, in which Keira Knightley plays Gwyn, the daughter of Robin Hood. This follows the tradition, begun by John Mair and popularised by Walter Scott, of assigning the Hood legends to Richard's reign. In this, Robin Hood, his daughter and the outlaws help Philip win the throne from his uncle, Prince John, and Philip and Gwyn fall in love.

VIIe/1) (Trumpet Concerto in E-flat major) in 1796 for his long-time friend, the trumpet virtuoso Anton Weidinger. Joseph Haydn was 64 years of age. A favourite of the trumpet repertoire, it has been cited as \\"possibly Haydn's most popular concerto\\". Original instrument Anton Weidinger developed a keyed trumpet which could play chromatically throughout its entire range. Before this, the trumpet was valveless and could only play a limited range of harmonic notes by altering the vibration of the lips; also called by the name of \\"natural trumpet\\". Most of these harmonic notes were clustered in the higher registers, so previous trumpet concertos could only play melodically with the high register (e.g., Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 2). Haydn's concerto includes melodies in the middle and lower register, exploiting the capabilities of the new instrument. There were attempts all over Europe around the mid-classical era to expand the range of the trumpet using valves, but Weidinger's idea of drilling holes and covering them with flute-like keys was not a success as it had very poor sound quality. Thus the natural trumpet still had continual use in the classical orchestra while the keyed trumpet had barely any repertoire. The valved trumpets used today were first constructed and used in the 1830s. Form The work is composed in three movements (typical of a Classical period concerto), they are marked as followed: In addition to the solo trumpet, the concerto is scored for an orchestra consisting of 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 (presumably natural) trumpets (which generally play in support of the horns or timpani rather than the solo trumpet), timpani, and strings.

A work of the best-known Bulgarian architect of the period, Nikola Fichev, the church was inaugurated on 19 September 1867 and constructed on the highest spot in the town. The three- naved church features a central dome and an elongated 30 m-long body with thin and high columns supporting the naves, as well as three smaller domes. The design of the fa√ßades is particularly remarkable. Fichev notably broke the Orthodox architectural canon by making the whole east fa√ßade a giant undulating apse. The iconostasis, 16 m long and an average 10 m high, was created by Anton Peshev from Debar in 1870‚Äì1872 and the 73 icons were painted by Nikolai Pavlovich, a master from Svishtov. The bell tower, stylistically a reference to Baroque architecture, was added in 1883‚Äì1886 and designed by Gencho Novakov. Several important figures, including the first Bulgarian Exarch Antim I (1872), the Metropolitan of Tarnovo Ilarion Makariopolski (1872) and the eparchial metropolitan bishop Clement of Tarnovo (1889) have held services in the church. It was also visited by Russian Emperor Alexander II, who attended the service on 28 June 1877. Alexander II also donated six bells for the bell tower. The Church of the Holy Trinity suffered damage from an earthquake on 4 March 1977, but was subsequently restored. Today, the church with its iconostasis is a cultural monument of national importance.

He is most well known for his revivalism and usage of the Sidereal Pendulum for divination and dowsing and for his anti-racialist stance and revivalist usage of the Armanen Futharkh runic system after the second world war, removing its negative connotations. During his involvement with the Fraternitas Saturni Spiesberger was also known as Frater Eratus. Under this name he published several articles in the Bl√§tter f√ºr angewandte okkulte Lebenskunst.  Life  Spiesberger was the son of a gardener.Magische Novellen. . S. 1. Since his earliest youth Spiesberger was interested in occultism and hypnosis. Auf dunklem Pfad zum Licht In May 1932 he moved to Berlin to attain a career as an actor. In 1935 he met the then already well-known magician and occultist Gregor A. Gregorius, Gregor A. Gregorius - Mystiker des dunklen Lichtes (who in 1928 founded the Lodge \\"Fraternitas Saturni\\") and came into close contact with him. Later he became one of its best-known members. He worked intensively with the magical use of the Armanen Futharkh runes. When this came in conflict with the Nazi regime he turned to other occult themes, such as the magic of the spheres and the ancient books of magic (Grimoires). After the upheavals and repressions of the second world war, Spiesberger headed an esoteric study circle, where he met his future wife, Christa. As a member of the lodge founded by Gardner Fraternitas Saturni he was brother under his lodge name \\"Eratus\\" 1948 in Riesa. Under high usage (hohem Einsatz), he wrote the lodge newspaper \\"Leaves for applied occult art of living\\" (\\"Bl√§tter f√ºr angewandte okkulte Lebenskunst\\"), as well as 42 books as a special titled \\"Inauguration\\" (\\"Einweihung\\"). When Gregorius reorganised the FS after the war in 1950 Spiesberger became a prominent teacher in the Berlin Lodge (Orient Berlin) of the FS. In the same time, he devoted himself to writing. Gregory gave Eratus [words seem to be missing here] on 18 March 1957 which made eternal faithfulness unto gradus solos (master level), at the initiation of the lodge and the demiurge Saturn. Gregor A. Gregorius - Mystiker des dunklen Lichtes, S. 114 In 1960 he withdrew from the lodge for unknown reasons. During the early 1960s discord and envy in the Fraternitas Saturni ruled; however, Spiesberger continued his researches undaunted. Due to his knowledge and diligence, he expected to assume leadership of the lodge after the demise of Gregorius'; the married Gardner, however, put forward his long-term lover, Sorella Roxane for the Office of the Grand Master. Due to divergent views on spiritual issues Spiesberger left the lodge, but continued to devote his time to lectures and his literary activities. In the 1980s, the animal lover reworked some of his works, which were reissued in new editions. He died in the age of 87 in Berlin and is also buried there.  Rune Magic  Spiesberger is well known as the single most important person to revive Germanic mysticism after the second world war, including the Armanen Runes and the Pendulum. Due to the Nazi suppression and imprisonment of \\"non-authorised\\" or \\"non- officially sanctioned\\" runic/Germanic mystics and revivalists and their respective organisations during the Third Reich (see Nazi mysticism) the runes were so closely associated with the Nazis that the use and discussion of them in academic as well as esoteric circles was hampered by adverse public opinion. Those of the old rune magicians and occultists who had survived the war in Germany, slowly began to make their way back to their work, and new voices were also heard. The best known of these new voices was Spiesberger. After the war the Armanen system was revived, and \\"reformed\\" by Spiesberger. Spiesberger was a widely qualified, \\"eclectic\\" occultist who has authored books in the hermetic as well as the runic tradition. His two principle works on runic topics are Runenmagie: Handbuch der Runenkunde (1955) and Runenexerzitien f√ºr Jedermann (1958). In these books he synthesises the work of all the German runic magicians and experts who preceded him, within a pansophical framework. Although he eliminates all the racist and v√∂lkisch elements,Thorsson, Edred; 'Futhark: A Handbook of Rune Magic', page 16 he retains the Armanen system of runes, which by 1955 had become almost traditional in German circles.  Work  Spiesberger's works were always cast in the 18 rune Futharkh (the Armanen Runes) as originally envisioned by Guido von List and magically developed by Siegfried Adolf Kummer. Both were proponents of the Armanen Runes. What Spiesberger essentially tried to do was remove the \\"racist\\" aspects of the Armanic and Marbyan rune work and place the whole system in a pansophical, or eclectic, context. To Guido von List, Friedrich Bernhard Marby, Siegfried Adolf Kummer and Rudolf John Gorsleben, the runes represent the key to esoteric understanding. To Spiesberger, they were just one more tool to be used by any individual magician. After the war he also wrote Der erfolgreiche Pendel-PraktikerAntiquario ‚Äì Handelsplattform f√ºr antiquarische Buecher published in 1963. Although still far more readily available in its original German text, it is now also available in its 1989 English translation entitled Reveal the Power of the Pendulum.Reveal the Power of the Pendulum: Secrets of the Sidereal Pendulum, A Complete Survey of Pendulum Dowsing , it was published in England 'W. Foulsham & Company Limited.' In this book about pendulum dowsing, he refers to the Odic force. Like most authors on esoteric or magical subjects, he presents a mixture of the old with some original innovations of his own. To some extent the innovations may have been drawn from the eclectic teachings of the Fraternitas Saturni. Selected works Karl Spiesberger has written many works.More details *Sinnen und Forschen, 1950 *Der Traum in tiefenpsychologischer und okkulter Bedeutung, 1950 *Das Problem der Tierseele, 1950 *Auf den Spuren der Seherin (mit Erich Sopp,), 1953 *Die Kunst, Karten zu legen, 1954 *Runenmagie, 1955 *Der erfolgreiche Pendelpraktiker, 1955 *Runenexerzitien f√ºr Jedermann, 1958 *Unsichtbare Helferkr√§fte, 1959/1960 *Elementargeister - Naturgeister, 1961 *Reveal the Power of the Pendulum: Secrets of the Sidereal Pendulum, A Complete Survey of Pendulum Dowsing, 1962. .

It migrates vertically daily, spending the day in deep water and the night in shallower water. One of the smallest shark species, the smalleye pygmy shark is known to reach only long. It has a blackish, spindle-shaped body with relatively small eyes, and a spine preceding the first dorsal fin, but not the second. Bioluminescent photophores occur on its underside, which may serve to disguise its silhouette from predators. This species feeds on small squid, krill, shrimp, and bony fishes. It is aplacental viviparous. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed it as Least Concern, citing its wide distribution and lack of threat from fisheries. Taxonomy The first known specimen of the smalleye pygmy shark was a female long, caught off Donggang, Taiwan, on September 23, 1958. It was described by Taiwanese ichthyologist Teng Huo-Tu, who gave it the specific epithet alii after a woman. The name subsequently came to be rendered as aliae in scientific literature. Some authors questioned the validity of the species, and in 1977 Jeffrey Alan Seigel and colleagues synonymized S. aliae with S. laticaudus. In 1987, Kunio Sasaki and Teruya Uyeno performed morphological comparisons and reaffirmed the distinctiveness of S. aliae. Distribution and habitat The smalleye pygmy shark appears to be widely distributed, but in patches, in the western Pacific Ocean, having been reported from off southern Japan, the Philippines, and northern and eastern Australia. It inhabits the upper and middle layers of the water column near land, at depths of . It conducts a diel vertical migration, spending the day in deeper water and rising to shallower waters at night. Description Among the smallest of extant sharks, the smalleye pygmy shark attains a maximum recorded length of . It is shaped like a cigar and has a bulbous, pointed snout. The eyes are relatively small, with their diameters measuring 43-66% as long as the snout (compared to 61-82% in S. laticaudus). The eyes of this species also differ from S. laticaudus in that the upper rim of the eye socket is chevron-shaped rather than nearly straight. The nostrils lack substantially expanded skin flaps in front. The mouth is nearly transverse and bears thin lips; a pair of papillae (nipple-like structures) is on the upper lip that is absent in S. laticaudus. There are 20-27 upper tooth rows and 18-23 lower tooth rows. The upper teeth are slender and upright. The larger, broader lower teeth have angled and knife-like cusps, and interlock to form a continuous cutting surface. The five pairs of gill slits are tiny and uniform. The two Squaliolus species are the only sharks that have a spine on the first dorsal fin, but not the second. The spine is usually exposed in males and covered by skin in females. The tiny first dorsal fin originates about over the rear tip of the pectoral fin. The second dorsal fin is long and low, and originates over the front half of the pelvic fin bases. The pectoral fins are short with rounded margins, and the pelvic fins are long and low. The anal fin is absent. The caudal peduncle is thin and bears slight lateral keels. Males have shorter abdomens and longer caudal peduncles than females. The caudal fin is broad and triangular, with nearly symmetrical upper and lower lobes and a prominent notch in the trailing margin of the upper lobe. The dermal denticles are flattened and not toothed or elevated on stalks. This species is dark brown to black in color, becoming light towards the fin margins. Its underside is covered by light-producing photophores. Biology and ecology Little is known of the natural history of the smalleye pygmy shark. It feeds primarily on midwater squid, krill, shrimps, and small bony fishes such as lanternfish. The photophores on its underside may serve to camouflage its silhouette from predators by matching the downwelling light, a strategy known as \\"counter- illumination\\". Reproduction is aplacental viviparous as in other members of its family, with the young being born under long. Males attain sexual maturity around long. Human interactions The smalleye pygmy shark is infrequently caught by fisheries because of its small size, and has no economic value. This, coupled with its wide range, has led the IUCN to list it as Least Concern.

The character first appeared in Teen Titans (vol. 3) #38 and was created by Geoff Johns and Tony Daniel. A villain in Trinity has also used the name. First Enigma Fictional character biography Not much is known about Enigma. She briefly joined the Teen Titans after Infinite Crisis, but like most of the members during that time she left. During this period, she was known as the Riddler's Daughter and seemed to be friends with Duela Dent. She is as talented at riddling as her father, throwing in some jokes from time to time. Enigma also wields a question mark-shaped cane as a weapon. One Year Later, she is a member of Deathstroke's villainous Titans East, now known as Enigma. During a battle, she says to Dent \\"Wait'll dear old daddy gets a load of us!\\", implying that they may be sisters, or at least in Duela's mind they are. Enigma and Duela later psychologically tortured Raven inside a hall of mirrors. There, she revealed that she joined Titans East as a way of getting her father, the Riddler, to accept her. It is revealed that the Joker's daughter is actually the daughter of the Jokester of Earth-3 and was part of the Riddler Family. In Enigma's first post-Teen Titans appearance, the main DC Universe Riddler confirms Enigma to be his daughter.Batman (vol. 1) #705 (February 2011) She later appeared alongside Riddler while fighting Batman. At the story's conclusion in Batman #712, the Riddler asks her, \\"What's purple and green and bleeds profusely?\\" Enigma's response is cut short by her scream. Notes * A Pre-Crisis Duela Dent used five different daughter disguises to get the attention of Robin, the Boy Wonder. She attempted to rob a Chinese restaurant dressed up like a female Riddler, and used question mark-shaped guns that fired rubber bullets. This ruse was discovered when Robin unmasked her, but just as soon as he did so, she escaped by using a smoke bomb. Second Enigma In issue #1 of the Trinity miniseries, a mysterious man, whose face is half-obscured by a metal mask and who is wielding a powerful staff, joins forces with Morgaine Le Fey. His true name is unknown, but he takes the moniker \\"Enigma\\", from what Le Fey initially called him. Along with Morgaine, he plans to conquer the Keystone Universe, a.k.a. New Earth, the current mainstream DC Universe, by forcibly integrating the personality of the Trinity, the group formed by Superman, Wonder Woman and Batman, and collecting artifacts related to their personal origins. The costume and theme are suggestive of the Riddler, who often goes by the alias Edward Nigma/Edward Nygma (although the half-mask is also suggestive of another Batman villain, Two-Face, as it appears Enigma's face is scarred in the same way as his is), but Enigma's true identity is deliberately kept a secret until later in the series. Approaching to the revelation, several clues are scattered throughout the miniseries: the Riddler claims to recognize the modus operandi of Enigma as his own, therefore asking Dick Grayson more time to exculpate himself. Morgaine, feeling Edward Nygma's life-force while he was at Madame Zodiac's mansion, claims that Riddler and Enigma share the same life-force, or a similar one. Enigma seems to have a personal connection to the Anti-Matter Earth, as evidenced by an emotional outburst when Despero suggests conquering it. This is confirmed when Enigma teleports himself to a base orbiting the Anti-Matter Earth.Trinity #14 Eventually, Enigma is unmasked when he attempts to sap Superman's powers via red sunlight radiation, but reversed in wavelength, which is ineffective over a being of New Earth; this spurs Superman into scanning Enigma's body with his X-ray vision, confirming that he is the Anti-Matter Earth's Riddler.Trinity #16 His backstory is later recounted: As the Quizmaster, Edward Nashton had formed the Justice Underground to challenge the Crime Syndicate's superiority. Eventually, Nashton's face was burned by Ultraman's heat vision, with his wife and infant son killed and his daughter's body nearly destroyed. In retaliation, Nashton set out to change the Anti-Matter Universe, using the power of the Trinity to do so.Trinity #21 Enigma and his allies successfully steal the Trinity's power, only for them to return as godlike beings. Enigma realizes that what they received was not the totality of the power they could have accrued and he devises a plan to complete this power, bickering with Morgaine over her usage of power (she had thoughtlessly destroyed most of Europe in her lashing out against the world). Ultimately, their second attempt fails when the godlike Trinity returns and Morgaine strikes a deal with Krona, hoping to gain his power by giving him the living soul of Earth, in return for the human soul within Enigma's robotic aide, S.P.H.E.R.E., the soul of Enigma's daughter, to replace it, with Morgaine holding her power over her. Enigma refuses and attacks Morgaine and Krona, only for S.P.H.E.R.E. to send him to the safety of the Anti-Matter Universe.Trinity #45 Enigma returns, having gained the aid of the Crime Syndicate, to help defeat Krona. When the Earth's soul is released, it rejects Krona and restores Enigma's daughter to life, fusing her soul with that of Krona's Void Hound. When the conflict is over, the two return to the Anti-Matter Universe, hoping to give its inhabitants hope.Trinity #52 References External links * Category:DC Comics female supervillains Category:Female characters in comics Category:Comics characters introduced in 2006 Category:Characters created by Geoff Johns Category:Characters created by Tony S.

Individual beds range from about 2 to 5 cm thick Radiolarite (Jurassic) from the Alps. Radiolarite is a siliceous, comparatively hard, fine-grained, chert-like, and homogeneous sedimentary rock that is composed predominantly of the microscopic remains of radiolarians. This term is also used for indurated radiolarian oozes and sometimes as a synonym of radiolarian earth. However, radiolarian earth is typically regarded by Earth scientists to be the unconsolidated equivalent of a radiolarite. A radiolarian chert is well-bedded, microcrystalline radiolarite that has a well-developed siliceous cement or groundmass.Neuendorf, K.K.E., J.P. Mehl, Jr., and J.A. Jackson, J.A., eds. (2005) Glossary of Geology (5th ed.). Alexandria, Virginia, American Geological Institute. 779 pp.  Mineralogy and petrology  Radiolarites are biogenic, marine, finely layered sedimentary rocks. The layers reveal an interchange of clastic mica grains, radiolarian tests, carbonates and organic pigments. Clay minerals are usually not abundant. Radiolarites deposited in relatively shallow depths can interleave with carbonate layers. Yet most often radiolarites are pelagic, deep water sediments. Radiolarites are very brittle rocks and hard to split. They break conchoidally with sharp edges. During weathering they decompose into small, rectangular pieces. The colors range from light (whitish) to dark (black) via red, green and brown hues. Radiolarites are composed mainly of radiolarian tests and their fragments. The skeletal material consists of amorphous silica (opal A). Radiolarians are marine, planktonic protists with an inner skeleton. Their sizes range from 0.1 to 0.5 millimeters. Amongst their major orders albaillellaria, ectinaria, the spherical spumellaria and the hood-shaped nassellaria can be distinguished.  Sedimentation  According to Takahashi (1983) radiolarians stay for 2 to 6 weeks in the euphotic zone (productive surface layer to 200 meters water depth) before they start sinking.Takahashi, K. and Honjo, S.(1983). Radiolarian skeletons: size, weight, sinking speed, and residence time in tropical pelagic oceans. Deep-Sea Research, 30, p.543-568 Their descent through 5000 meters of ocean water can take from two weeks to as long as 14 months.Takahashi, K.(1981). Vertical flux, ecology and dissolution of Radiolaria in tropical oceans: implications for the silica cycle. Unpublished Ph.D. Thesis, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Massachusetts Institute of Technology As soon as the protist dies and starts decaying, silica dissolution affects the skeleton. The dissolution of silica in the oceans parallels the temperature/depth curve and is most effective in the uppermost 750 meters of the water column, farther below it rapidly diminishes. Upon reaching the sediment/water interface the dissolution drastically increases again. Several centimeters below this interface the dissolution continues also within the sediment, but at a much reduced rate. It is in fact astonishing that any radiolarian tests survive at all. It is estimated that only as little as one percent of the original skeletal material is preserved in radiolarian oozes. According to Dunbar & Berger (1981)Dunbar, R. B. and W. H. Berger (1981) Fecal pellet flux to modern bottom sediment of Santa Barbara Basin (California) based on sediment trapping,Bulletin of the Geological Society of America, v. 92, pp. 212-218 even this minimal preservation of one percent is merely due to the fact that radiolarians form colonies and that they are occasionally embedded in fecal pellets and other organic aggregates. The organic wrappings act as a protection for the tests (Casey et al. 1979) and spare them from dissolution, but of course speed up the sinking time by a factor of 10.  Diagenesis, compaction and sedimentation rates  After deposition diagenetic processes start affecting the freshly laid down sediment. The silica skeletons are etched and the original opal A slowly commences to transform into opal CT (opal with crystallites of cristobalite and tridymite). With increasing temperature and pressure the transformation proceeds to chalcedony and finally to stable, cryptocrystalline quartz. These phase changes are accompanied by a decrease in porosity of the ooze which becomes manifest as a compaction of the sediment. The compaction of radiolarites is dependent on their chemical composition and correlates positively with the original SiO2-content. The compaction factor varies generally between 3.2 and 5, which means that 1 meter of consolidated sediment is equivalent to 3.2 to 5 meters of ooze. The alpine radiolarites of the Upper Jurassic for instance show sedimentation rates of 7 to 15.5 meters/million years (or 0.007 to 0.0155 millimeters/year), which after compaction is equivalent to 2.2 to 3.1 meters/million years. As a comparison the radiolarites of the Pindos Mountains in Greece yield a comparable value of 1.8 to 2.0 meters/million years, whereas the radiolarites of the Eastern Alps have a rather small sedimentation rate of 0.71 meters/million years.Garrison, R. E., and Fischer, A. G., 1969. Deep-Water limestones and radiolarites of the Alpine Jurassic. In Friedman, G. M. (Ed.) Depositional environments in carbonate rocks. Soc. Econ. Palentol. Mineral. Spec. P√ºbl. 14. 20 According to Iljima et al. 1978 the Triassic radiolarites of central Japan reveal an exceptionally high sedimentation rate of 27 to 34 meters/million years. Recent non-consolidated radiolarian oozes have sedimentation rates of 1 to 5 meters/million years.De Wever, P., and I. Origlia-Devos; 1982, Datations novelles par les Radiolarites de la serie des Radiolarites s. l. du Pinde- Olonos, (Greece), C. R. Acad. Sc. Paris., 294, p.399-404 In radiolarian oozes deposited in the equatorial Eastern Atlantic 11.5 meters/million years have been measured. In upwelling areas like off the Peruvian coast extremely high values of 100 meters/million years were reported.  Depth of deposition  The view that radiolarites are mainly deposited under pelagic, deep water conditions cannot be asserted any longer. Layers enriched in radiolarians do even occur in shallow water limestones like the Solnhofen limestone and the Werkkalk Formation of Bavaria. What seems to be important for the preservation of radiolarian oozes is that they are deposited well below the storm wave base and below the jets of erosive surface currents. Radiolarites without any carbonates have most likely been sedimented below the calcite compensation depth (CCD). One has to bear in mind that the CCD has not been stationary in the geological past and that it is also a function of latitude. At present, the CCD reaches a maximum depth of about 5000 meters near the equator.Berger, W. H. & Winterer, E. L. (1974). Plate stratigraphy and the fluctuating carbonate line. Editors: Hs√º, K.

Pelagic sediments: on Land and under the Sea, p. 11-48  Banding and ribbons  Kennedy Ranges, near Gascoyne Junction, Western Australia in the permanent collection of The Children's Museum of Indianapolis. The characteristing banding and ribbon-like layering often observed in radiolarites is primarily due to changing sediment influx, which is secondarily enhanced by diagenetic effects. In the simple two component system clay/silica with constant clay supply the rhythmically changing radiolarian blooms are responsible for creating a clay-chert interlayering. These purely sedimentary differences become enhanced during diagenesis as the silica leaves the clayey layers and migrates towards the opal-rich horizons. Two situations occur: with high silica input and constant clay background sedimentation thick chert layers form. On the other hand, when the silica input is constant and the clay signal varies rhythmically fairly thick clay bands interrupted by thin chert bands accumulate. By adding carbonates as a third component complicated successions can be created, because silica is not only incompatible with clays but also with carbonates. During diagenesis the silica within the carbonate-rich layers starts pinching and coagulates into ribbons, nodules and other irregular concretions. Resulting are complex layering relationships that depend on the initial clay/silica/carbonate ratio and the temporal variations of the single components during sedimentation.  Occurrence in time and space   Paleozoic  Silurian lydite of Saxony, near Nossen (Nossen-Wilsdruff Slate Mountains) The oldest known radiolarites come from the Upper Cambrian of Kazakhstan.Tatiana J. Tolmacheva, Taniel Danelian & Leonid E. Popov. Evidence for 15 m.y. of continuous deep-sea biogenic siliceous sedimentation in early Paleozoic oceans Radiolarian ooze was sedimented here over a time span of 15 million years into the Lower Ordovician. The deep water sediments were deposited near the paleoequator and are associated with remnants of oceanic crust. The dating has been done with conodonts. In more lime-rich sections four radiolarian faunal associations were identified. The oldest, rather impoverished fauna dates back well into the second stage of the Ordovician (Arenigian). The youngest fauna consists already of 15 different taxa and belongs to the fifth stage (Lower Caradocian).Taniel Danelian, Leonid Popov (2003). La biodiversit√© des radiolaires ordoviciens: regard √† partir des donn√©es nouvelles et r√©vis√©es provenant du Kazakhstan. Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© G√©ologique de France, 174, N¬∫. 4, p. 325-335, ISSN 0037-9409 During the Middle Ordovician (Upper Darriwillian) radiolarites were formed near Ballantrae in Scotland. Here radiolarian cherts overlie spilites and volcanic rocks. Radiolarites are also found in the nearby Southern Uplands where they are associated with pillow lava. The Scottish radiolarites are followed by deposits in Newfoundland from the Middle and Upper Ordovician. The red Strong Island Chert for instance rests on ophiolites. At the Silurian/Devonian boundary black cherts (locally called lydites or flinty slates) developed from radiolarians mainly in the Frankenwald region and in the Vogtland in Germany. Of great importance are the novaculites from Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas which were deposited at the close of the Devonian. The novaculites are milky-white, thinly-bedded cherts of great hardness; they underwent a low-grade metamorphism during the Ouachita orogeny. Their mineralogy consists of microquartz with a grain-size of 5 to 35 Œº. The microquartz is derived from the sclerae of sponges and the tests of radiolarians. During the Mississippian black lydites were sedimented in the Rhenish Massif in Germany.Schwarz, A. (1928). Die Natur des culmischen Kieselschiefers. Abh. senckenberg. naturf.

Terra Abstracts, 3, p. 256-257}  Mesozoic  During the Triassic (Upper Norian and Rhaetian) cherty, platy limestones are deposited in the Tethyan region, an example being the Hornsteinplattenkalk of the Frauenkogel Formation in the southern Karawanks of Austria.Lein, R. et al.

Innsbruck, 20, p. 371-387 They are composed of interlayered cherts and micrites separated by irregular, non-planar bedding surfaces. The cherty horizons have originated from radiolarian-rich limestone layers which subsequently underwent silicification. Similar sediments in Greece incorporate layers with calcareous turbidites. On local horsts and farther upslope these sediments undergo a facies change to red, radiolarian-rich, ammonite-bearing limestones.Bosselini, A. & Winterer, E.L. (1975). Pelagic limestone and radiolarite of the Tethyan Mesozoic: A generic model. Geology, 3, p. 279-282 In central Japan clay-rich radiolarites were laid down as bedded cherts in the Upper Triassic. Their depositional environment was a shallow marginal sea with rather high accumulation rates of 30 meters/million years. Besides radiolarians sponge spicules are very prominent in these sediments.Iljima, A. et al. (1978). Shallow-sea, organic origin of the Triassic bedded chert in central Japan. J. of the Faculty of Sci., Univ. of Tokyo, Sec. 2, Vol. XIX, 5, p. 369-400 From the Upper Bajocian (Middle Jurassic) onwards radiolarites accumulated in the Alps. The onset of the sedimentation was diachronous but the end in the Lower Tithonian rather abrupt. These alpine radiolarites belong to the Ruhpolding Radiolarite Group (RRG) and are found in the Northern Calcareous Alps and in the Penninic of France and Switzerland (Graub√ºnden). Associated are the radiolarites of Corsica. The radiolarites of the Ligurian Apennines appear somewhat later towards the end of the Jurassic. From the Middle Jurassic onwards radiolarites also formed in the Pacific domain along the West Coast of North America, an example being the Franciscan complex. The radiolarites of the Great Valley Sequence are younger and have an Upper Jurassic age. The radiolarites of California are paralleled by radiolarite sedimentation in the equatorial Western Pacific east of the Mariana trench. The accumulation of radiolarian ooze on Jurassic oceanic crust was continuous here from the Callovian onward and lasted till the end of the Valanginian.Ogg, J. G. et al. (1992). 32.

Radiolarites from the Upper Cretaceous can be found in the Zagros Mountains and in the Troodos Mountains on Cyprus (Campanian). The radiolarites of Northwestern Syria are very similar to the occurrences on Cyprus and probably have the same age.

Res., 87, p. 3633-3643 Younger radiolarites are not known - probably because younger radiolarian oozes didn't have sufficient time to consolidate.  Use  Radiolarite is a very hard rock and therefore was extensively used by stone-age man for tools and weapons. Radiolarite has therefore been called the \\"iron of the Paleolithic\\". Axes, blades, drills and scrapers were manufactured from it. The cutting edges of these tools, however, are somewhat less sharp than flint.

Growing no larger than roughly , it is one of the smallest sharks alive, with this record beaten by the dwarf lanternshark. This shark has a slender, cigar-shaped body with a sizable conical snout, a long but low second dorsal fin, and an almost symmetrical caudal fin. Its sister species S. aliae and it are the only sharks with a spine on the first dorsal fin and not the second. Spined pygmy sharks are dark brown to black, with numerous bioluminescent organs called photophores on their ventral surface. The shark is believed to use these photophores to match ambient light conditions, which break up its silhouette and help the shark to avoid being seen by predators below. Usually inhabiting nutrient-rich waters over upper continental and insular slopes, the spined pygmy shark feeds on small bony fishes and squid. Like its prey, it is a diel vertical migrator, spending the day at close to deep and moving towards a depth of at night. Reproduction is presumably aplacental viviparous, with females giving birth to litters of up to four pups. This diminutive shark has no economic value. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as of Least Concern, as it faces little threat from commercial fisheries and has a wide distribution. Taxonomy and phylogeny The spined pygmy shark was one of many new species discovered during the course of the 1907‚Äì1910 Philippine Expedition of the U.S. Fish Commission Steamer Albatross. It was described by American ichthyologists Hugh McCormick Smith and Lewis Radcliffe in a 1912 paper for the scientific journal Proceedings of the United States National Museum, based on two specimens collected in Batangas Bay, south of Luzon in the Philippines. One of these, a 15-cm-long adult male, was designated the type specimen. Smith and Radcliffe coined the new genus Squaliolus for this shark, and gave it the specific epithet laticaudus, from the Latin latus meaning \\"broad\\" or \\"wide\\", and cauda meaning \\"tail\\". The spined pygmy shark may also be referred to as the dwarf shark or the bigeye dwarf shark. Based on similarities in their claspers (male intromittent organs), the closest relative of the spined pygmy shark and the related S. aliae is thought to be the pygmy shark (Euprotomicrus bispinatus). Distribution and habitat The spined pygmy shark has a wide distribution around the world. In the Atlantic Ocean, it occurs off Bermuda, the United States, Suriname, southern Brazil, and northern Argentina in the west, and off northern France, Madeira, Cape Verde, and the Azores in the east. In the Indian Ocean, this species has only been recorded off Somalia. In the Pacific Ocean, it is found off southern Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines. The spined pygmy shark is found at depths of and seldom approaches the surface, unlike the related pygmy shark and cookiecutter shark (Isistius brasiliensis). This shark prefers areas of high biological productivity over upper continental and insular slopes. It may also be found over outer shelves, but avoids central ocean basins. The range of this species does not overlap that of the pygmy shark, which has a similar ecology, and is also largely separate from that of the cookiecutter shark. Description One of the world's smallest sharks, the spined pygmy shark attains a maximum recorded length of for males and for females. This species has an elongated, spindle-shaped body with a long, bulbous, moderately pointed snout. The eyes are large, with the upper rim of the orbit almost straight. Each nostril is preceded by a short flap of skin. The mouth has thin, smooth lips and contains 22‚Äì31 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 16‚Äì21 tooth rows in the lower jaw. The upper teeth are narrow and smooth- edged with single upright cusps. The bases of the lower teeth are broad and interlocked to form a continuous cutting surface, with each tooth bearing a single upright, smooth-edged, knife-like cusp. The openings of the five pairs of gill slits are minute and uniform in size. The two species of Squaliolus are the only sharks with a spine on the first dorsal fin but not the second. The spine is sexually dimorphic, being typically exposed in males and enclosed by skin in females. The first dorsal fin is tiny and originates over the trailing margin of the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin is low, with a base twice as long as that of the first, and originates over the anterior half of the pelvic fin bases. The pectoral fins are short and triangular, with the rear margin slightly curved. The pelvic fins are long and low, and there is no anal fin. The caudal peduncle is slender and laterally expanded into weak keels. The caudal fin is broad and paddle-like, with the upper and lower lobes of similar size and shape, and a deep notch in the trailing margin of the upper lobe. The dermal denticles are flat and blocky, not elevated on stalks or bearing marginal teeth. The coloration is dark brown to black, with light fin margins. The underside is densely carpeted by light-emitting photophores, which extend to the tip of the snout and around the eyes and nostrils, and thin to almost non-existent on the back. This species has on average only 60 vertebrae, the fewest of any shark. Biology and ecology Lanternfish are preyed upon by the spined pygmy shark. The diet of the spined pygmy shark consists mainly of bony fishes (including the dragonfish Idiacanthus, the lanternfish Diaphus, and the bristlemouth Gonostoma) and squid (including members of the genera Chiroteuthis and Histioteuthis). Catch records suggest that the spined pygmy shark follows its prey on their diel vertical migrations, spending the day close to a depth of and ascending towards a depth of at night. The ventral photophores of the spined pygmy shark have been theorized to function in counter-illumination, a form of camouflage in which the shark disguises its silhouette from would-be predators by matching the ambient light welling down from above. There is no evidence that this shark swallows its shed teeth like the pygmy and cookiecutter sharks. The spined pygmy shark is aplacental viviparous like the rest of its family, with the developing embryos being sustained by a yolk sac until birth. Adult females have two functional ovaries that may each contain up to 12 mature eggs. However, the actual litter size is much smaller; a pregnant female caught off southern Brazil in 1999 contained four near-term pups. The young are born at long. Males mature sexually at a length of , and females at a length of . The spined pygmy shark was widely considered to be the smallest living shark species until the discovery of the dwarf lanternshark (Etmopterus perryi), though the pygmy ribbontail catshark (Eridacnis radcliffei) is also known to mature at a size comparable to these two species. Whether one of these sharks is definitively smaller than the others cannot yet be stated with certainty, because of the difficulties involved in assessing reproductive maturity in sharks.Martin, R.A. (July 28, 1999) What is the Smallest Species of Shark? ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research. Retrieved on September 27, 2009. Human interactions Spined pygmy sharks have no commercial value; they sometimes appear in the bycatch of trawl fisheries, but are generally too small to be captured. In light of its wide distribution and the absence of substantial threats from human activity, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as of Least Concern.

A rock bolt is a long anchor bolt, for stabilizing rock excavations, which may be used in tunnels or rock cuts.

Rock bolts were applied to civil tunneling support in the U.S. and in Australia starting in the late 1940s. Rock bolts were used and further developed starting in 1947 by Australian engineers who began experimenting with four-meter-long expanding anchor rock bolts while working on the Snowy Mountains Scheme.Meacham, Steve.

As shown in the photo, rock bolts may be used to support wire mesh, but this is usually a small part of their function. Unlike common anchor bolts, rock bolts can become 'seized' throughout their length by small shears in the rock mass, so they are not fully dependent on their pull-out strength. This has become an item of controversy in the Big Dig project, which used the much lighter pull-out tests for rock bolts rather than the proper tests for concrete anchor bolts.

In September 1915, assigned to the intelligence service established in an island in the Levantine Mediterranean, he organized a network covering the entire Levant. He continued to lead this mission as of August 1916, as second in command of aviso Laborieux, then at Kastel√≥rizo on the coast of Anatolia. Second in command of submarine in September 1917, he participated in campaigns in the Adriatic until the end of the war. In January 1919, he was sent to Rijeka to serve in the intelligence service, then in Egypt and Lebanon. Lieutenant de Vaisseau in June 1919, he commanded the submarine Le Verrier in the Mediterranean (1920‚Äì1922), and wrote studies of analysis on the role of torpilleurs during the Battle of Jutland and the employment of tactical submarines engaged in chases by groups in which he advocated the anticipation of ideas which were later realized by Admiral Donitz during the Second World War.

Capitaine de corvette in January 1927, he was assigned in the previous November to the cabinet of Georges Leygues, minister of the Navy (), where he particularly worked towards the specific enacting of the organic decree of April 22, 1927 which reorganized the navy. He was appointed to command the destroyer in the Mediterranean in 1929, Capitaine de frigate in April 1930, he was tasked to manage and run the application school of the enseignes de vaisseau embarked on board the 1st Light Division which replaced in provision the Jeanne-d'Arc and conducted accordingly a long campaign on the African coasts, Antilles and the Mediterranean. He then commanded a squadron of large destroyers comprising and in the Mediterranean. Director of the center of studies and second in command of the √âcole navale at Brest in 1933, he served then in the cabinet of Fran√ßois Pi√©tri, minister of the Navy () (1934‚Äì1935), then commanded the cruiser √âmile-Bertin in squadron in the Atlantic. Capitaine de Vaisseau in October 1936, he received in October 1937 the command of the Jean-d'Arc and the application school of the enseignes de vaisseau with whom he conducted a tour around the world (1937‚Äì1938) and a second campaign in the Atlantic and the Pacific. He exercised the functions of military governor of Polynesia (1938‚Äì1939). He was accordingly assigned to studies section of the √âtat-Major general. In anticipation of the war which was expected, he was sent to London to coordinate future operations with the Royal Navy. He held his own views regarding the evacuation at Dunkirk or by Operation Catapult. Second chief in command of general headquarter staff of maritime forces () in October 1939, he assumed with Admirals Fran√ßois Darlan, Maurice Le Luc and N√©gadelle, the reception of various inbound convoys.  At the service of Vichy  At Vichy, the counter-admiral Auphan was part of the tenant groups which harbored a political view of attentisme (the act of waiting and refraining until situations become more clear and precise). Designated as chief of the headquarter staff of maritime forces () in August 1941, he maintained contact with the American diplomatic representation to Vichy by transmitting various couriers. State Secretary of the Navy () as of April 1942, he opposed the demanding German requirements related to materials of merchant tonnage. Along with French Army general Maxime Weygand, he assumed a staunch positions of opposition to the politics of collaboration at the corps of the government. A partisan of a suspension of combat between French and Americans during the Anglo-American disembarking of November 8, 1942 in North Africa, he opposed those who wanted to continue to mount combat along the Germans. On November 11, 1942, chef d'√©tat major, counter-admiral Auphan ordered the two admirals of Toulon to: * oppose, without shedding blood, the entry of foreign troops in the establishments, the aerial bases, and naval auxiliaries; * oppose similarly the entry of foreign troops on board of the fleet's naval vessels; by local negotiations, effort one self to arrive to a mutual accord; * in case impossible, scuttle the fleet. This last solution which was applied, on the night of November 26 and 27, 1942, when admirals Andr√© Marquis, maritime prefect and Jean de Laborde , commanding forces of the high-seas, heard that the Germans were moving forward to attempt to make way with the fleet. After having incited without success Philippe P√©tain to leave the metropolis, he tendered his resignation on November 18, 1942. On August 11, 1944, he was tasked by marshal P√©tain to approach g√©n√©ral de Gaulle. He was not received and was accordingly arrested.  After 1945  On August 14, 1946, he was judged and condemned in absentia to forced labor, degraded national status, and confiscation of his properties. On July 19 and 20, 1955, a second hearing condemned him to only five years in prison with probationary measure and five years of degraded national status. In 1956, the State Council gave him back his rank and rights for pension. Auphan dedicated his life later to writings: a close figure to g√©n√©ral Maxime Weygand or colonel Remy, he published his souvenirs, and defended his views, remaining loyal to the memories of Marshal Philippe P√©tain. The Counter-admiral Auphan was a member of the Association of Catholic writers until his death, in 1982.

Neumann, The isomorphism problem for algebraically closed groups, in: Word Problems, Decision Problems, and the Burnside Problem in Group Theory, Amsterdam-London (1973), pp. 553‚Äì562. Recall that to define a group G\\\\ by means of a presentation, one specifies a set S\\\\ of generators so that every element of the group can be written as a product of some of these generators, and a set R\\\\ of relations among those generators. In symbols: :G \\\\simeq \\\\langle S \\\\mid R \\\\rangle. Informally G\\\\ is the group generated by the set S\\\\ such that r = 1\\\\ for all r \\\\in R. But here there is a tacit assumption that G\\\\ is the \\"freest\\" such group as clearly the relations are satisfied in any homomorphic image of G\\\\ . One way of being able to eliminate this tacit assumption is by specifying that certain words in S\\\\ should not be equal to 1. That is we specify a set I\\\\ , called the set of irrelations, such that i e 1\\\\ for all i \\\\in I. Formal definition To define an absolute presentation of a group G\\\\ one specifies a set S\\\\ of generators, a set R\\\\ of relations among those generators and a set I\\\\ of irrelations among those generators. We then say G\\\\ has absolute presentation :\\\\langle S \\\\mid R, I\\\\rangle. provided that: # G\\\\ has presentation \\\\langle S \\\\mid R\\\\rangle. # Given any homomorphism h:G\\\\rightarrow H such that the irrelations I\\\\ are satisfied in h(G)\\\\ , G\\\\ is isomorphic to h(G)\\\\ . A more algebraic, but equivalent, way of stating condition 2 is: :2a. if N\\\\triangleleft G\\\\ is a non-trivial normal subgroup of G then I\\\\cap N eq \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ 1\\\\right\\\\\\\\} . Remark: The concept of an absolute presentation has been fruitful in fields such as algebraically closed groups and the Grigorchuk topology. In the literature, in a context where absolute presentations are being discussed, a presentation (in the usual sense of the word) is sometimes referred to as a relative presentation, which is an instance of a retronym. Example The cyclic group of order 8 has the presentation :\\\\langle a \\\\mid a^8 = 1\\\\rangle. But, up to isomorphism there are three more groups that \\"satisfy\\" the relation a^8 = 1\\\\, namely: :\\\\langle a \\\\mid a^4 = 1\\\\rangle :\\\\langle a \\\\mid a^2 = 1\\\\rangle and :\\\\langle a \\\\mid a = 1\\\\rangle. However none of these satisfy the irrelation a^4 eq 1. So an absolute presentation for the cyclic group of order 8 is: :\\\\langle a \\\\mid a^8 = 1, a^4 eq 1\\\\rangle. It is part of the definition of an absolute presentation that the irrelations are not satisfied in any proper homomorphic image of the group. Therefore: :\\\\langle a \\\\mid a^8 = 1, a^2 eq 1\\\\rangle Is not an absolute presentation for the cyclic group of order 8 because the irrelation a^2 eq 1 is satisfied in the cyclic group of order 4.  Background  The notion of an absolute presentation arises from Bernhard Neumann's study of the isomorphism problem for algebraically closed groups. A common strategy for considering whether two groups G\\\\, and H\\\\, are isomorphic is to consider whether a presentation for one might be transformed into a presentation for the other. However algebraically closed groups are neither finitely generated nor recursively presented and so it is impossible to compare their presentations. Neumann considered the following alternative strategy: Suppose we know that a group G\\\\, with finite presentation G=\\\\langle x_1,x_2 \\\\mid R \\\\rangle can be embedded in the algebraically closed group G^{*}\\\\, then given another algebraically closed group H^{*}\\\\,, we can ask \\"Can G\\\\, be embedded in H^{*}\\\\,?\\" It soon becomes apparent that a presentation for a group does not contain enough information to make this decision for while there may be a homomorphism h:G\\\\rightarrow H^{*}, this homomorphism need not be an embedding. What is needed is a specification for G^{*}\\\\, that \\"forces\\" any homomorphism preserving that specification to be an embedding. An absolute presentation does precisely this.

Biography Born in D√ºsseldorf, Germany, as the son of Elisabeth Br√ºggemann and Karl Grashof, who taught at an upper secondary school, Franz Grashof visited the elementary and lower secondary school in D√ºsseldorf and the industrial school in Hagen. Motivated by the rise of steamers and the railway, he started working at a locksmith‚Äôs shop. In October 1844 Franz Grashof quit school to start studying metallurgy at the royal vocational institute in Berlin, where he studied mathematics, physics and mechanical engineering. From 1847 to 1848 he interrupted his studies to voluntarily serve for the military. To serve his country he aimed at becoming a marine officer. Therefore, he had to start working as a simple sailor on a sailing ship called ‚ÄúEsmeralda‚Äù. Until December 1851 he sailed around the world and realized that practical work was not his main professional skill. On his journey he decided to teach at a technical school. That‚Äôs why he carried on studying in Berlin in 1852. In 1854 Franz Grashof concluded his studies and became a teacher in mathematics and mechanics at the royal vocational institute in Berlin. In 1855 he got the leadership of the royal gauging office in Berlin. In the following year he was involved in the establishment of the Association of German Engineers and became its managing director until 1890. From 1863 to 1891 he was a professor of General and Theoretical Machine Science at the Technische Hochschule Karlsruhe. He developed some early steam-flow formulas but made significant contribution to free convection. On October 26, 1893 he died after his second stroke. Honors In Karlsruhe (Germany) on October 26, 1896 a memorial was inaugurated to honor his efforts. The Grashof Number was named after him. It is a very important dimensionless parameter in analyzing natural or free convection. The Grashof Condition was also named after him. It is a test used often when analysing kinematic chains. After Grashof's death, the Association of German Engineers (VDI) honored his memory by instituting the Grashof Commemorative Medal as the highest distinction that the society could bestow for merit in the engineering skills.

Faribault invited Father Augustine Ravoux to establish a mission among the Sioux Indians in what would become the town of Chaska. Fr. Ravoux built a small log chapel and named the parish St. Francis Xavier, but dismantled the chapel three years later when the Native Americans saw the European immigration as a threat, and in turn threatened to burn the chapel down. The chapel was sold to German Catholic Christians in Wabasha and floated down the river to its new home.Coller, Julius A., II. The Shakopee Story. North Star Pictures, Inc., 1960, p. 13.http://www.wabashakelloggparishes.org/About-Us In the 1850s the Benedictine Fathers made frequent visits to the Chaska area ‚Äì mostly to German immigrant communities along the Minnesota River, formerly called St. Peter‚Äôs River ‚Äì to determine whether a community was large enough to support a church. Minnesota achieved statehood in 1858 and during that year the Benedictines decided that Chaska was able to support a church. The congregation had difficulty choosing a name for the new church, so they decided to have Michael Guenser's two-year-old daughter look at pictures of saints and select one. She chose the picture of the Guardian Angel, and so the church was named Guardian Angels Catholic Church. Since the first log chapel in 1842, three churches were built. The first was built between the years of 1858 and 1860. It was a simple, small brick building with planks on wooded blocks that served as pews. In the mid-to-late-19th century, immigrants from Germany were fleeing official persecution of Catholic Christians in historically Catholic parts of Prussia and, later, the German Empire. They were flocking to familiar scenery in Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota, including the Minnesota River valley. Immigrants were also leaving the Netherlands and Germany in search of land for growing families. The Dutch Catholics immigrating to the area were usually labeled as ‚Äúdestitute‚Äù by Dutch authorities. By 1864, rapid population growth in the area saw the need for a larger church and in 1868 work began on a second church. This church served the community's needs until 1885 when construction began on the present church. This church, designed by John Geiser was built in Gothic Revival Style architecture. The new church was an imposing structure on the landscape, constructed of Chaska Brick with a steeple towering 162 feet above the street. The interior ceiling rose 39 feet above the floor. It was described as one of the most adorned structures in the area. The new building was dedicated by Bishop Thomas Langdon Grace, O.P. of St. Paul in 1885. On October 7, 1902 disaster struck when an early morning fire destroyed the church interior, toppling the steeple onto a neighboring house and destroying it. By 5 o'clock that afternoon all that remained were the four charred walls and the Icon of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, blessed by Pope Pius IX in 1871. Showing resiliency, within one year the parish reconstructed the church we see today on the present site. It was dedicated by Archbishop John Ireland of St. Paul one year later to the day it burned. The church exhibits all of the hallmark characteristics of the Gothic Revival style including Gothic arch windows and doors, corbelled brick, brick buttresses, quatrefoil motifs in the stained glass windows, and a central buttressed tower with a steeply pitched steeple. Through the years, many changes took place inside the parish ‚Äì the Benedictines were replaced by Franciscans who built a novitiate for incoming Franciscan friars. In 1995, the Franciscan Fathers and Brothers left Guardian Angels after serving 117 years to pursue other ministries with their limited number of members. In 2012, Father Conran Schneider, the last Franciscan to live in the friary at Guardian Angels, died of lung cancer and pneumonia.http://www.bertasfh.com/obituary/1463435 References Category:Churches in Carver County, Minnesota Category:Chaska, Minnesota Category:Churches in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis Category:German-American culture in Minnesota Category:Religious organizations established in 1858 Category:1858 establishments in Minnesota Category:churches completed in the 1880s Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in Minnesota ","title":"Guardian Angels Church (Chaska, Minnesota)"},{"id":"7176865","text":"The Paddy Pallin Classic was a cross country ski event held in the Australian Alps.

She is best known for the belief that she was Etta Place, the former girlfriend of the famous outlaw Harry Alonzo Longabaugh, aka the Sundance Kid, who was allegedly killed in a shootout in South America in November 1908. For many years, there were no known photographs of Eunice Gray; but two photographs recently were found that appear to demonstrate that she could not have been Etta Place. Arrival in Fort Worth Gray was described as a beautiful woman, and according to Pinkerton reports, she arrived in Fort Worth, Texas, and began running a brothel in 1909 after Etta Place had been seen for the last time in San Francisco, where she may have requested assistance in obtaining a death certificate for Longabaugh, in an effort to settle his estate. Speculation about Eunice Gray being Etta Place Gray was semi-wealthy, and many speculated that she was in fact Etta Place. She never made any indication that she was, but instead she avoided the topic altogether. She ran her brothel until at least 1925, at which time she took over the Waco Hotel, located at 110 E. 15th Street in Fort Worth. Contrary to common belief, the connections between Place and Gray did not establish themselves to any great extent at the time she arrived in Fort Worth, but rather many years afterwards. During her entire time in Fort Worth, she gave one interview, in which she told Delbert Willis of the Fort Worth Press: \\"I've lived in Fort Worth since 1901. That is except for the time I had to high-tail it out of town. Went to South America for a few years . . . until things settled down\\". This traditionally has been thought to be something to do with J. Frank Norris, an anti-vice crusader. He did not arrive in Fort Worth until 1909, and his infamous siege of Hell's Half Acre, the city's red-light district, didn't occur until 1912. Etta Place, by contrast, was in South America from February 1901 to June 1906. Willis also conceded that Gray never admitted or even claimed to be Etta Place; he merely made that connection on his own, given the similarities of their age, the fact that both had classic good looks, and that the period in which Gray said she went to South America coincided, albeit roughly, with when Place was in South America. Photographic evidence For many years, there were no known photographs of Gray in that period to compare with the one known high-quality photograph of Place. Willis believed that the similarities were striking, but in the absence of a photograph of Gray, there was no way of verifying or refuting his observation. More recently, amateur genealogist Donna Donnell found Eunice Gray on a 1911 passenger list from Panama. It was reported in 2007 that she had tracked down Eunice Gray's niece, who had two photographs of her: one wearing her high-school graduation dress circa 1896 and another taken in the 1920s. Comparing the photos with one of Place, both agreed that Eunice Gray was definitely not Etta Place.Woman's Face Proves She's No Place. The Genealogue. 24 March 2007. Accessed 18 December 2010. Death and identity In January 1962, Eunice Gray died in the fire which destroyed the Waco Hotel, which she still owned and operated at 110 1/2 East 15th street in Fort Worth, Texas. Documents saved from the fire indicated that she had been born in 1884. The documents found after the fire further showed that Gray's estate was valued at more than $90,000. There were no letters or communications to verify her family, her origin, or where she had lived between 1901 and 1909. Donna Donnell's research many years later found that Eunice Gray's real name had been Ermine McEntire. She had actually been born in 1880. She is buried in Platte City Cemetery in Platte City, Missouri. References External links * Who Was Etta Place? * Etta Place theories * . Also has the photographs of Eunice Gray.

For many years, White was a fixture in the NY studio scene, writing and producing hundreds of commercials for TV and radio. In this capacity, he worked with artists like Gladys Knight, Linda Ronstadt, Dwight Yoakam, Ricky Skaggs, Kim Carnes, Felix Cavaliere, Dobie Gray, Mavis Staples and Aaron Neville among many others. His relationships with Marc Cohn and Shawn Colvin led to his producing Colvin‚Äôs Grammy-nominated, ‚ÄúI Don‚Äôt Know Why‚Äù and to his involvement in Cohn‚Äôs eponymous platinum debut record. White went on to produce three records for legendary J. Geils Band leader, Peter Wolf. The second of which, ‚ÄúSleepless,‚Äù garnered the distinction by Rolling Stone magazine of being one of ‚Äúthe 500 greatest albums ever made,‚Äù as well as giving Kenny a chance to work with Keith Richards, Mick Jagger and Steve Earle. White was again at the helm for Wolf's 2010 critically acclaimed release, Midnight Souvenirs. This time working with Shelby Lynne, Neko Case and Merle Haggard. A new project with Wolf entitled, A Cure for Loneliness, was released in April 2016. As a contributing writer/musician, White worked on many film soundtracks including, Message in a Bottle, Ed TV, Forces of Nature, A Walk on the Moon, Where the Heart Is, Edie & Pen, and four films by indie director, John Sayles. After being hailed by reviewers from the NY Times to the SF Chronicle for his thrilling and unique piano playing, White chose to devote himself to making his first album and subsequentially, ‚Äúhitting the road.‚Äù His work in the studio enabled him to assemble an A-list team of players for that release, 2002‚Ä≤s Uninvited Guest. He traveled and opened shows for many mainstays, including Shawn Colvin, Cowboy Junkies, Peter Wolf, Cheryl Wheeler and Jonathan Edwards, quickly gaining a reputation as a ‚Äòdazzling‚Äô and ‚Äònot-to-be-missed‚Äô performer. An early copy of his follow-up record, Symphony in 16 Bars landed in the hands of folk legend Judy Collins who then signed White to her own Wildflower Records and released the CD in the winter of 2005. Showcasing another remarkable ensemble of talent, Symphony in 16 Bars picked up where Uninvited Guest left off, following the main character whose story, set in New York City, navigates the heart‚Äôs complexities through an ever- changing urban landscape. In 2006, he compiled a politically-tinged, 5 song EP entitled, Never Like This. In early 2008, White's \\"How Long\\" from that record, won in The 7th Annual Independent Music Awards for Best Social Action Song.Independent Music Awards - 7th Annual Winners White was also invited to accept the prestigious \\"International Songwriter\\" award at 2012's Premio Ciampi in Livorno, Italy. In 2010, White released his Comfort in the Static, also on Collins', Wildflower Records label, earning high praise from David Crosby and celebrated songwriter, Will Jennings. NY's legendary DJ, Pete Fornatale declared Comfort in the Static the best album of 2010, \\"it's a lock,\\" said Pete, 6 months before the end of that year. And now, in 2016, Kenny has just released his latest effort, Long List of Priors, featuring appearances by Peter Wolf and David Crosby, as well as Larry Campbell, Ada Dyer, Duke Levine, Shawn Pelton, Marty Ballou, John \\"Scrapper\\" Sneider, and with string arrangements handled by Antoine Silverman.

This shark is caught (and discarded) as bycatch by bottom trawlers throughout its entire limited range, and may be threatened given the declines in other bottom deep sea species in Suruga Bay. This species grows to long. It is similar to other rough sharks in having a stout, high trunk, a dorsally depressed head, and two sail-like dorsal fins with deeply embedded spines. The snout is short, with large nostrils whose lateral and medial apertures are separated by a thick nasal flap. The eyes and spiracles are oval in shape. The five pairs of gill slits are very small and vertical. The mouth is small, with thick, fleshy lips; the teeth in the upper jaw are narrow, erect, and smooth-edged, while those in the lower jaw are broad, blade-like, and smooth-edged. Only one row of teeth in the lower jaw are functional. The large dorsal fins are subtriangular in shape, with the first dorsal spine sloping slightly backward. The pectoral fins have a convex front margin and a concave rear margin. The anal fin is absent. There is a strong ridge running between the pectoral and pelvic fins on each side of the body. The dermal denticles are large and widely spaced, giving the skin a very rough texture. This species differs from the similar sailfin roughshark in the positioning of the dorsal fins and the shape of the spiracle. The color is a uniform dark brown, with the lips, nasal flap margins, fin axils and inner margins of claspers white. Reproduction is ovoviviparous, as in other dogfish sharks.

In the film, Santa works in outer space and does battle with a demon named Pitch, sent to Earth by Lucifer to ruin Christmas by killing Santa and \\"making all the children of the Earth do evil\\". A dubbed and slightly edited English-language version was produced for U.S. release in 1960 under the direction of Ken Smith. It was lampooned on an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Plot On December 24, Santa prepares for his yearly journey at his Toyland castle in space. He plays the organ while his children helpers from all over the world sing. Meanwhile, in Hell, Lucifer instructs his chief demon Pitch to travel to Earth and turn the children of the world against Santa. In a busy marketplace, Pitch attempts to convince five children to \\"make Santa Claus angry\\": Lupita, a poor girl; Billy, the son of wealthy but negligent parents; and three troublemaking brothers. Pitch fails at convincing Lupita to steal a doll from a vendor, but succeeds in convincing the brothers to break a shop window. Santa's child workers alert him to these events. Unable to travel to Earth before nightfall on Christmas Eve, he instead uses equipment to watch Pitch and the children. One device allows him to view Lupita's dream, induced by Pitch, in which she is tormented by life- sized dancing dolls who entice her to steal. He also listens as the three brothers plot to break into Billy's home and steal his presents. They also attempt to write a letter to Santa claiming they have been good, but Santa's voice informs them that he can see all that they do. Merlin the wizard, Santa's most trusted assistant, gives Santa a sleep inducing powder and a flower that allows him to disappear. He then retrieves a magic key that will open any door on Earth and prepares his mechanical reindeer. On Earth, the three rude boys plot to capture and enslave Santa. Meanwhile, Lupita and her mother say a prayer and Lupita says that she has wished for two dolls, one of which she will give to the Baby Jesus. During Santa's journey, Pitch makes several unsuccessful attempts to sabotage Santa's delivery of toys in Mexico City. Santa succeeds in reuniting Billy with his parents, who had left him alone to go to a restaurant. On a city rooftop, the three brothers prepare to capture Santa and steal his toys. They see Santa's sleigh in the sky and hurry indoors, only to find that they have received coal. After a failed attempt to steal the sleigh, Pitch succeeds in emptying Santa's dream powder bag while Santa drops the disappearing flower. Santa's trip is nearly complete when he is chased by a vicious dog outside a large house in Mexico. Finding himself without the powder or the flower, he climbs a tree to escape the dog. Pitch appears and proceeds to wake the household and calls the fire department to report a fire at that location, so that Santa will soon be seen by many people. With dawn approaching, Merlin assists with a last-minute escape and Pitch is defeated after being doused with the spray from a fire hose. Before returning to the castle Santa makes one final stop, leaving a doll for Lupita. His labors now completed, Santa steers the sleigh back to the castle, content in the knowledge that he has brought happiness to all of Earth's children.

This appears to be the running time of recent home video editions of the English dub. At least one brief scene was cut from the English edition, and further footage was removed from the individual prints as they aged and suffered damage. The original film was approximately three minutes longer than the version now seen in the United States. Santa Claus was filmed in Eastmancolor with a monaural soundtrack. Critical reception The film was considered to be a financial success over several holiday season theatrical releases in the 1960s and 1970s. Broadcast of the film also became a holiday tradition at several U.S. television stations. The film garnered at least one award, winning the Golden Gate Award for Best International Family Film at the San Francisco International Film Festival in 1959. Mystery Science Theater 3000 The film was featured in the fifth season of Mystery Science Theater 3000 (episode #521), which first aired on Christmas Eve 1993. The devil Pitch became a recurring character on MST3K, played by writer Paul Chaplin. Chaplin said, \\"It's kind of a fun movie, and we all enjoyed it\\", noting that he made \\"quite an attractive demon\\". The episode may be the origin of the phrase \\"nightmare fuel\\"; during the movie, Crow T.

It should not be confused with the Malta National Order of Merit as established by an Act of Parliament (see below). The Medal of Merit was eventually replaced by the ƒ†ieƒß ir-Repubblika. Origin of the Medal From the 1950s, up to the early 1970s many localities in Malta had set up a Council made up from representatives of all the organisations/societies within their locality. These councils were non-partisan and more often than not both major political parties used to be represented. It must be said that the administration (both political and the Civil Service) did not fully welcome such activities as the Councils were seen to interfere in their decisions. In the 1960s, the majority of Councils decided to organise a Confederation of Civic Councils. This gave the individual Councils more muscle power. The Confederation wanted to be pro- active and one idea was to establish a National Honour to show the nation‚Äôs appreciation to certain persons who would have made a name through their activities. Awards committee With the backing of the Confederation, the Secretary, Mr Francis (Frans) Said approached The Hon. Mr Justice Professor J.J. Cremona who at that time was the Vice President of the Constitutional Court and the Court of Appeal. Professor Cremona was also a Judge on the European Court of Human Rights. (Later Professor John J. Cremona was appointed Chief Justice). With such a personality who accepted to act as Chairman of the award committee, they approached other personalities to serve on the committee. Apart from both of them, these included Dr G. Borg PhC, MD; Professor G. Galea, MBE, KM, MD, DPH, FRSH, Mr J. Dalli and Mr A Farrugia. The design of the Medal was carried out by the renowned artist Emvin Cremona. The eventual medals were cast in bronze by the Firm Francis Abela & Sons who also used to carry out the plating in gold or silver. All those concerned did their work free of charge as the Confederation did not have any particular funds. The award committee decided that there should be three types of medals, namely Gold for exceptional service, silver for merited services and bronze for laudable services. It was also decided that the announcement of the recipients was to be made on the 21 September (Independence Day) of each year, considering that at that time it was the National Day. Awards The first awards were announced on September 21, 1968 to three personalities that had made their name not only in Malta but even more so around the world. The general reaction was very positive. A second set of medals were awarded in 1969. In 1970 the committee started to face a certain amount of flack as there were those that felt that the Confederation was aiming too high. Professor Cremona argued the case, but the committee still missed the 1970 announcement. Therefore in 1971 the committee announced two gold medals. Also, in an effort to avoid political implications, the 1971 awards were announced on the 8 September (Victory Day), which once again had become Malta‚Äôs National Day. Demise of the Medal That was the last of the Medal of Merit. In 1971 there was a change of government and certain elements within it were against all Civic Councils, even though this was not the official position. To be fair, the previous administration never accepted them in full, but at least they were allowed to operate. The collapse of the individual Councils meant the demise of the Confederation and in turn also of the Medal of Merit. Professor Cremona together with Frans Said discussed this topic at very high levels, but to no avail. They wanted that the award would be incorporated on an official level. While the government accepted the need for a national award, they had been told that it was planning to expand on their work and establish its own award system. In 1975, the government kept its promise and introduced an updated and more extensive award system that was established through the ƒ†ieƒß ir-Repubblika Act, which was further consolidated in 1990 by the foundation of the National Order of Merit under the same Act. Three of the recipients were eventually also included within the National Order of Merit. Recipients of the Medal of Merit 1968 *Gold -- Prof. Joseph E.

Engleman, a United States Army veteran and a St. Louis dentist, planned and carried out at least seven murders for monetary gain over the course of 30 years. He was already serving two life sentences in a Missouri state prison when he pleaded guilty to the murder of a man and his wealthy parents in a separate contract killing that occurred in Illinois. Engleman was a sociopath, once stating that his talent was to kill without remorse, and he enjoyed planning and carrying out killings and disposing of the remains in order that it would net him financial rewards. His first known killing occurred in collaboration with his ex-wife. His ex-wife Ruth married another man, raised his life insurance and then Engleman killed him, both sharing the benefits. Later he would repeat these tactics for other murders. Engleman would use his financial worth, sex and charm to manipulate women he was close to, ex-wives, lovers and his dental assistant, in helping him formulate and execute elaborate murder schemes. This led to one of his lovers, Barbara Boyle, being convicted as an accomplice and serving less than half of a 50-year sentence. Another accomplice, Robert Handy, was also convicted and served time in prison. Methods used to kill his victims included shooting, bludgeoning with a sledgehammer and explosives. The exact number of his victims is unknown. He is the subject of Susan Crane Bakos 1988 book Appointment for Murder. The cases against him were re-enacted in a rare, two- part episode of the crime documentary series \\"The FBI Files\\". Early life Engleman was born the youngest of four children, his father was a member of the United States Air Force. He was raised in the middle class and lived in a nice home that his parents owned. Academically he was an above average student in school, but he didn't excel in any specific subject. He graduated in dentistry at Washington University in St. Louis, in 1954. He had been admitted under the GI Bill, having previously served in the US Army Air Corps. Known victims 1958: Engleman is suspected of the death of James Stanley Bullock, 27, a clerk for Union Electric Company of Missouri and part-time student. Shot near the St. Louis Art Museum. Edna Ruth Bullock (n√©e Ball) and James Bullock were married on June 28, 1958, they had been married for five and half months on the date he was murdered. Edna Ruth Bullock was Engleman's ex-wife prior to her marriage with James Bullock, she collected $64,000 ($580,000 in 2020) from James Bullock's life insurance. 1963: Engleman is suspected in the murder of Eric Frey, a business associate of Engleman at Pacific Drag Strip, in which Frey and the Engleman were partners. Engleman struck him with a rock, pushed him down a well, and used dynamite to blow him up afterwards. He then divided the insurance proceeds with Frey's widow. 1976: Peter J. Halm. Shot in Pacific, Missouri. His wife, Carmen Miranda Halm, a former dental assistant trainee who had worked for Engleman and known him since childhood, ordered the hit to collect a $60,000 ($271,600 in 2018) policy of life insurance on Halm. 1977: Arthur and Vernita Gusewelle at their farmhouse near Edwardsville, Illinois. Arthur was shot; Vernita bashed to death. Engleman then murdered their son Ronald Gusewelle in East St. Louis, Illinois 17 months later so his widow Barbara Gusewelle Boyle could claim the millions in life insurance she had taken out on her husband, the sole heir to his parents' oil business. Boyle collected approximately $340,000 ($1.46M in 2018) following her husband's murder. Boyle was convicted in her husband's murder but was acquitted of killing his parents. She was subsequently sentenced to 50 years in prison for the murder of her husband. She was released from the Dwight Correctional Center on October 10, 2009. Robert Handy, the accomplice, pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit the three Gusewelle killings and was sentenced to 14 years and served his time in prison. Engleman confessed to the three killings while in prison. 1980: Sophie Marie Barrera, owner of South St Louis Dental Laboratory. Killed in car bomb explosion. Engleman owed her over $14,000 ($45,860 in 2018). On 25 September 1980, a jury in federal court found Engleman guilty in the murder of Barrera. Engleman was accused of her murder to authorities by her son, Frederick Barrera. Family and death Engleman was married twice, first to Edna Ruth and then to Ruth Jolley, with whom he had a son, David Engleman. His first marriage Edna Ruth was when they both planned and decided on their method of killing. Edna Ruth Ball married another man, raised his new husband's life insurance, Engleman killed him and they both shared the profits. Edna Ruth was never prosecuted due to lack of evidence. In March 1999, Engleman, 72, was pronounced dead in the infirmary of the Jefferson City Correctional Center, where he had a history of treatment for diabetes. A spokesman for the center said his death had been anticipated.

The runic exercises, comparable to the \\"runic gymnastics\\" of Marby, runic dancing and runic songs were taught. Kummer held that :\\"As a we now can receive various waves by means of a radio device, so the German by means of runic exercises and dances can regulate the influx of invisible ethereal cosmic waves. Those who dismiss this as impossible will never be able to detect thought waves, because they are in disharmony with the cosmic All, and are impeded by racially foreign blood.\\"\\"Wie man nun im Radioapperat verschiedene Wellen aufnehmen kann, so kann der Germane durch Runen√ºbungen und T√§nze ebenfalls den Zustrom von unsichtbaren, feinstofflichen Allwellen regulieren.

One of the outstanding racehorses of the 20th Century, he was only beaten once in his career, when he was 2nd in the 1977 St Leger after starting the 4/7 favourite. Background Alleged was a bay horse bred by June McKnight. He was sold twice as a young horse, being sold for $34,000 as a yearling and $175,000 as a two-year-old. On the second occasion he was bought by Robert Sangster and his associates and sent to be trained in Europe. He ran originally in the colours of Robert Fluor before being transferred to Sangster's colours towards the end of his 3-year-old career.R S Reeves. Crown Jewels of Thoroughbred Racing. The Blood Horse, Kentucky, 1997, . According to Sangster, the original intention was to race Alleged in California, but it was felt that the colt's forelegs would not stand up to the stresses of American racing. Alleged was trained at Ballydoyle, in Ireland by Vincent O'Brien. Racing career Alleged did not appear on a racecourse until November 1976, when he won the 7-furlong Donnelly's Hollow Maiden Stakes by 8 lengths at the Curragh. As a three-year-old he won the Ballydoyle Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse in April in workmanlike style but then created a 33/1 upset by winning the Royal Whip Stakes at the Curragh, beating his stable companion Valinsky who started favourite as well as the previous year's Irish St Leger winner, Meneval. Alleged then won the Gallinule Stakes and was originally scheduled to run in the Irish Derby, but Vincent O'Brien decided to run Epsom Derby winner The Minstrel instead and rested Alleged until August when he outclassed a strong field in the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York. Alleged started favourite for the St. Leger Stakes, but finished second to Dunfermline. Many observers felt that jockey Lester Piggott erred in taking on Dunfermline's two pacemakers throughout the race rather than conserving Alleged's stamina and using his superior finishing speed.Ivor Herbert and Jacqueline O‚ÄôBrien (1984), Vincent O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs Great Horses, Pelham Books In the 1977 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, Alleged led for most of the way and won readily by one and a half lengths from Balmerino, easily reversing placings with Dunfermline who finished fourth. At four, Alleged was unbeaten in three races. He won the Royal Whip Stakes again, but then missed the summer due to sore shins followed by a virus. He returned in the autumn to win the Prix du Prince d'Orange at Longchamps, breaking the course record for 10 furlongs. He then won his second Arc, winning by two lengths from the fillies Trillion and Dancing Maid. Assessment In the inaugural International Classification, a collaboration between the official handicappers of Britain, France and Ireland, Alleged was rated the best European horse of 1977 with a rating of 138. He was again rated the best European horse in 1978 with a rating of 140. Alleged was given a Timeform rating of 137 in 1977 and 138 in 1978.

For over half a century, he made contributions to the methodology of data collection, analysis and presentation, and to understanding buyer behaviour and how advertising works. Biography Andrew Ehrenberg was born in Germany in 1926 into a well-known academic family. His father was Hans Ehrenberg, his uncle was the historian Victor Ehrenberg, and Geoffrey and Lewis Elton his cousins. He moved to England with his parents in 1938, and attended Queen's College, Taunton. Subsequently, he studied statistics at Kings College, Newcastle and Cambridge University. In 1951, he became Lecturer in Statistics at the Institute of Psychiatry in London, and in 1955 moved into commercial marketing research and consulting, where his writings on statistical methodology in marketing research and wider fields soon became well-known. In 1970, he was invited to take the Chair of Marketing and Communication at the London Business School, where he remained for 23 years, eventually taking up a Research Chair. In 1993, Ehrenberg became Professor of Marketing at the London South Bank University where he founded the Centre for Research in Marketing, and started the Research and Development Initiative which was funded by businesses internationally to pursue and disseminate quantitative marketing knowledge. The R. and D. I. became closely associated with the Marketing Science Centre at the University of South Australia and in 2004, Ehrenberg was succeeded as Director of the R. and D. I. by Professor Byron Sharp of the School of Marketing at UNISA. In 2005, Ehrenberg retired completely from the R. and D. I. The Marketing Science Centre has now been expanded by the University of South Australia to form The Ehrenberg-Bass Institute for Marketing Science and the Centre for Research in Marketing at LSBU was renamed the Ehrenberg Centre for Research in Marketing in 2005, and Dr. Dag Bennett is now the director. The former R. and D. I. has been incorporated into both the above. Ehrenberg held the rare distinction of having been awarded the Gold Medal of the British Market Research Society twice, first in 1969 and again in 1996. He also held the Honorary Fellowship of the Royal Statistical Society. In December 2005 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the University of South Australia. In 2010, he received the Lifetime Achievement Award of the (American) Advertising Research Foundation. Ehrenberg wrote six books and over 200 publications. He retired at the age of 80. Research methods An early interest in social science applications of statistics had already begun to show through in Cambridge (such as extensive experiments into the reliability of trained taste-testers for quality assessments and into price subsidies in the food industry). Also developed were two early aversions, the first to multivariate techniques imposed on simple data, and the second to mathematics for its own sake in applied statistics. Ehrenberg's belief that the methods of physical science are applicable to social science was expressed in an article in the hard science journal Nature.Ehrenberg, A. (1993a), Even the social sciences have laws, Nature, 365, 30 September 385. In it he asserted that even in a field dominated by people's impulses to buy, that of marketing, there are striking regularities. The discovery and development of such lawlike relationships, was described in series of papers.Ehrenberg, A., (1966) Laws in Marketing ‚Äì A tailpiece, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series C, 15, 257‚Äì268.Ehrenberg, A., (1968) The Elements of lawlike relationships, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A, 131, 280‚Äì329.Ehrenberg, A. (1969), The discovery and use of laws of Marketing, Journal of Advertising Research, 9,2, 11‚Äì17. The definitive statement of this position came later in another paper read to the Royal Statistical Society.Ehrenberg A. and Bound, J. (1993b), \\"Predictability and Prediction, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A, 156, 2, 167‚Äì206. The summary stated baldly: Ehrenberg always pointed out that very many models of very different functional form may be generated with almost identical goodness of fit. The selection of an appropriate model form to express a quantitative relationship is governed in his view by the need for: #Previous knowledge. This seems obvious but standard statistical modelling techniques seldom if ever start from any reference to any earlier model. #Simplicity. Models with many parameters cannot be tested in their variations by new data. #Adequate but not unnecessarily wide scope. Scope means the range of conditions in which the model has been found to apply. Empirical models are not of universal application. Decision on whether the scope is adequate depends on technical knowledge of the topic being modelled. #The absence of bias in predictions. Closeness of fit is secondary to this. Exceptions to the model may be noted. #A structural model, which remains meaningful under algebraic transformation. This rules out regression techniques ‚Äì even simple regression produces two different equations. The failure to use any technique of optimisation either in model form selection or parameter determination has however been widely criticised. Ehrenberg has answered these criticisms by pointing to the absence of published and widely used models generated by conventional techniques. Another criticism is that Ehrenberg's published models deal with relationships between the averages of groups, and thus ignore variability between individuals. The ideas in this section were used in one of Ehrenberg's principal fields of work, the study of buyer behaviour. Buyer behaviour In 1955, Ehrenberg moved into marketing research working on consumer panels. His first milestone paper was \\"The Pattern of Consumer Purchases\\" Ehrenberg, A. (1959) The pattern of consumer Purchases, Applied Statistics, 8,1, 26‚Äì41. which showed the applicability of the negative binomial distribution to the numbers of purchases of a brand of consumer goods. In the early 1980s, with Gerald Goodhardt and Chris Chatfield, he extended the NBD model to account for brand choices. The generalisation to the multi-brand case was put forward in \\"The Dirichlet: A Comprehensive Model of Buying behaviour\\" Goodhardt G.J., Ehrenberg, A. and Chatfield (1984), The Dirichlet: A comprehensive model of buying behaviour, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A, 147, 621‚Äì655. and was read to the Royal Statistical Society. Finally published in 1984 the NBD-Dirichlet model of brand choice successfully modelled the repeated category and brand purchases within a wide variety of markets. 'The Dirichlet', as it became known, accounts for a number of empirical generalisations, including Double Jeopardy, the Duplication of Purchase law, and Natural Monopoly. It has been shown to hold over different product categories, countries, time, and for both subscription and repertoire repeat-purchase markets. It has been described as one of the most famous empirical generalisations in marketing, along with the Bass model of diffusion of innovation. In an independent effort, Bemmaor,Bemmaor, A. C.(1981a) \\"Stochastic Modeling of Consumer Purchase Behavior: I. Analytical Results\\", Working paper No. 81006, ESSEC Business School, Cergy-Pontoise, France.Bemmaor, A. C.(1981b) \\"Stochastic Modeling of Consumer Purchase Behavior: II. Applications\\", Working paper No. 81007, ESSEC Business School, Cergy-Pontoise, France. and Schmittlein, Bemmaor and Morrison Schmittlein, D. C., A. C. Bemmaor and D. G. Morrison (1985) \\"Why Does the NBD Model Work? Robustness in Representing Product Purchases, Brand Purchases and Imperfectly Recorded Purchases,\\" Marketing Science, Vol. 4, No. 3, 255‚Äì266. reported the same model. They studied its statistical properties, and in particular as it reduces to the simple NBD model. They labelled the univariate model as the Beta Binomial/Negative Binomial Distribution (BB/NBD). The model has since been extensively applied under this name by both academics and practitioners. Ehrenberg's work in this field was summarised in the book \\"Repeat Buying\\".Ehrenberg A.(1988) Repeat-buying: facts, theory and applications, 2nd ed., Edward Arnold, London; Oxford University Press, New York. Reprinted in the Journal of Empirical Generalisations in Mark Science, 2000, 5, 392‚Äì770 (www.empgens.com). Ehrenberg derived from these models of buyer behaviour a view on advertising for established brands.Goodhardt GJ, Ehrenberg A., Collins M. (1987), The television audience, 2nd ed. Gower, Aldershot, UK.Barwise, P. and Ehrenberg, A. (1988), Television and its Audience, Sage, London, 1998. It mostly serves to publicise the advertised brand, but seldom seems to persuade.Ehrenberg, A., Barnard N., Kennedy R., and Bloom, H. (2002), Brand advertising as creative publicity, Journal of Advertising Research, 42, 4, 7‚Äì18. Promotions have only a short-term effect, and do not affect a brand's subsequent sales or brand loyalty. The extra buyers during the promotion have been seen almost all to have bought it before the promotion rather than being the hoped for new buyers.Ehrenberg A., Hammond K. and Goodhardt G. (1994), The after-effects of price-related consumer Promotions, Journal of Advertising Research, 34,4, 11‚Äì21. Data reduction This is another strand in Ehrenberg's work. In 1975, he first published Data Reduction.Ehrenberg, A. (1975,1981), Data Reduction, John Wiley, Chichester. Reprinted in the Journal of Empirical Generalisations in Marketing Science, 2000, 5, 1‚Äì391 (www.empgens.com). The book has been revised, reprinted and translated (Ehrenberg 1981). It maintains that much of the approach to research methods and prediction depends on finding patterns in data and this is much aided by its presentation in simple tables. Such tables also aid communication of results. The basic ideas are very simple. They depend on the principles of how memory works: clear layout of simple tables, rounding of figures, placing figures to be compared in the same column and showing averages. This work has had a major effect in on the way data are presented in academia, commerce but less in the British public sector. There the layout of the official British Monthly Digest of Statistics under Sir Harry Campion antedated Ehrenberg by many years, but set a pattern in many ways the same. Communication Over more than fifty years, Ehrenberg worked not only to discover new principles and understanding, nearly always using data already available. He worked just as hard to communicate ‚Äî to write simply and understandably, and to present figures in such a way as to tell an understandable story. His tables and charts always supported his communication. They did not ask the readers themselves to undertake the work of extracting meaning from the data. Ehrenberg drafted and re-drafted, often to the exasperation of his collaborators. He was tireless in presenting and publicising his conclusions on both sides of the Atlantic, though recently to the present writer he observed that his own major failure was in effectively communicating his principles to the users of statistics. His work continues, though, to influence the practice of both statistical science and marketing.

Giratina first appeared in the video games Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl, but gained prominence in the sister game, Pok√©mon Platinum, in which it is the mascot and a major part of the storyline. It later appeared in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. Giratina is featured prominently in the film Giratina and the Sky Warrior, and later appears in the films Arceus and the Jewel of Life and Pok√©mon the Movie: Hoopa and the Clash of Ages. Known as the Renegade Pok√©mon, Giratina is one of a trio of legendary Pok√©mon, alongside Dialga and Palkia, that represents Pok√©mon Platinum and appears on its cover art. While Dialga and Palkia represent time and space, Giratina represents antimatter. In Platinum, it was given a unique design called the Origin Forme, a floating creature similar to a snake or larva. Since it appeared in the Pok√©mon series, Giratina has received generally positive reception. It has been featured in several forms of merchandise, including figurines, plush toys, and the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game. Concept and creation Giratina is one of the legendary Pok√©mon trio of Sinnoh, alongside Dialga and Palkia. Giratina has a long, platinum-colored, segmented body with six legs, and has ghostly wings with red spikes. Six rib- like yellow rings encircle its neck, and the pale yellow ornament on its head resembles a human collarbone. When it is in its own realm, the Distortion World, or holding a Griseous Orb, it takes on its , which differs from the \\"Altered Forme\\" ( in Japanese) it takes in the real world. This form is a more serpentine creature with a beak-like mouth, long spiked ‚Äústreamers‚Äù instead of wings, and spikes in place of legs. It was created along with Dialga and Palkia by Arceus, though it was banished by Arceus due to its violence to the dimension called the Distortion World. It has since been forgotten from the legends as \\"one whose name was never to be spoken.\\" While Dialga and Palkia represent time and space, Giratina represents the dimensions besides those of time and space, the desolate void that exists between these planes, and the antimatter that suffuses it. Though residing within the Distortion World, it can also visit a cemetery-like ruin known as Turnback Cave, a place where the dimensional boundaries are said to be distorted and dead Pok√©mon can enter the physical world. Giratina is capable of interdimensional travel, albeit doing so causes it to change forms (Unless holding a \\"Griseous Orb\\"). It can see into the normal world through mirrors and reflective objects. The designers of Pok√©mon Platinum designed Giratina's Origin Forme to be the \\"opposite\\" of Dialga and Palkia, as well as to make its existence \\"more fun, more interesting, cooler\\". They paid \\"meticulous attention\\" to the Origin Forme's details; the designer \\"redrew Giratina's image again and again\\" in order to make it \\"significantly different\\" and change its shape. The designers eventually decided to feature the Origin Forme on the cover of Platinum. Designer Junichi Masuda envisioned concepts of \\"reversed world\\", \\"matter and anti-matter\\", and \\"E = mc2\\" in designing it. Its location, the Distortion World, was designed by Takeshi Kawachimaru around Giratina, with the concept as \\"how Giratina fits in the world\\". When designing its theme, Masuda \\"thought of the front/back, life/death\\" to make it cover \\"bipolar, opposite ideas\\". Appearances In the video games In the video games Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl, Giratina can be found in Turnback Cave after the player defeats the Elite Four. In the enhanced version of Diamond and Pearl titled Pok√©mon Platinum, Giratina serves as the mascot and appears on its cover. It features a design unique to it called the Origin Forme. It also appears in Pok√©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver as part of a special event. Outside of the main titles, Giratina appears in Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness and Pok√©mon Rumble. In Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, and Ultimate, it appears in its Altered Forme as a Pok√© Ball/Master Ball summon, using Dragon Breath upon being released. It also appears as a spirit. In other media Giratina as seen in Pok√©mon: Giratina and the Sky Warrior. Giratina is featured prominently in the film Pok√©mon: Giratina and the Sky Warrior as one of main protagonists. Giratina also appears in the film Pok√©mon: Arceus and the Jewel of Life and Pok√©mon the Movie: Hoopa and the Clash of Ages. Giratina also appears in the manga based on the three films. In the Pok√©mon Adventures manga, the Rocket Executives use Arceus' power to create replications of Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina, but they have been calmed down and fled. Reception Since appearing in Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl, Giratina has received a generally positive reception. It was featured in a Pok√©mon Platinum-themed deck of playing cards as the Joker. As a bonus for pre-ordering Platinum, select customers would receive a 2.75\\" sculpted figurine of Giratina's Origin Forme. This was a part of a promotion called \\"Search for Giratina\\", which also encompassed a number of other promotional items. In Europe, Nintendo made available a limited edition DS Lite featuring Giratina's Origin Forme through their \\"Stars Catalogue\\" which could be purchased with coins that are earned by buying Nintendo games and registering them. It is considered to be a popular Pok√©mon by sources such as IGN and GameSpot. GamesRadar editor Carolyn Gudmundson called it \\"fearsome,\\" while PALGN's \\"Toastfarmer\\" called it \\"scary.\\" Official Nintendo Magazines Tom East bemoaned the lack of villains in the Super Smash Bros. series, suggesting that Giratina would be a good choice for a playable character in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. He described it as the \\"biggest badboy of them all\\" and cited its impressive statistics and wide variety of abilities as reason for it to appear. 1UP.com's Justin Haywald described Giratina's new form as one of Platinums \\"biggest draws\\". In a poll conducted by IGN, it was voted as the thirty-ninth top Pok√©mon, where the staff commented that it is \\"kind of terrible to look at\\".

M., et al. ‚ÄúEmbryo Development and Maternal√¢¬Ä¬ìEmbryo Nutritional Relationships of Piked Spurdog (Squalus Megalops).‚Äù Marine Biology, vol. 150, no. 4, 2006, pp. 727‚Äì737., doi:10.1007/s00227-006-0393-2. The shortnose spurdog's size is dependent on the sex of the animal. The female shortnose spurdog is consistently larger than the male shortnose spurdog and will typically measure out to about 56.41 cm (1.85 ft) while the male shortnose spurdog will typically only measure out to about 44.36 cm in length (1.46 ft) which means the female shortnose spurdog is over 10 cm longer than the male shortnose spurdog.Marouani, Sondes, et al. ‚ÄúFirst Data on the Age, Growth and Sexual Maturity of the Piked Spurdog, Squalus Megalops (Chondrichthyes: Squalidae), in the Gulf of Gab√É¬®s (Central Mediterranean Sea).‚Äù Marine and Freshwater Research, vol. 67, no. 5, 2016, p. 578., doi:10.1071/mf14356. Some females can even measure up to 78 cm which is over 2.5 feet long.Braccini, J.

The life span of spurdog's can be quite long with females typically living longer than males. The average life span of a female shortnose spurdog is 0‚Äì29 years old while the male life span is 0-26 though it is estimated that a female can live up to 46 years while a male can only live up to 33. Females also take longer to reach sexual maturity than males and on average are not fertile until they are over 15 years of age. 7 years longer than the 8 years it takes males to reach maturity. The shortnose spurdog's eat a variety of items but primarily favor cephalopods such as squid and octopuses for their meals. Other organisms that have been found in their stomachs include fish, hermit crabs, sponges, brittle stars, the remains of sea lion and even primary producers such as algae.Braccini, J, et al. ‚ÄúSources of Variation in the Feeding Ecology of the Piked Spurdog (): Implications for Inferring Predator√¢¬Ä¬ìPrey Interactions from Overall Dietary Composition.‚Äù ICES Journal of Marine Science, 2005, doi:10.1016/j.icesjms.2005.04.004.  Habitat  The shortnose spurdog's primary populations are off the coasts of southern Africa and Australia. It is possible that the shortnose spurdog may also live in the eastern Atlantic, southern Indian Ocean and western North Pacific but there has been no data to support these populations so far. It was recently confirmed however that there are shortnose spurdogs in the Mediterranean Sea.Marouani, Sondes, et al. ‚ÄúTaxonomic Research on Squalus Megalops (Macleay, 1881) andSqualus Blainvillei (Risso, 1827) (Chondrichthyes: Squalidae) in Tunisian Waters (Central Mediterranean Sea).‚Äù Scientia Marina, vol. 76, no. 1, 2011, pp. 97‚Äì109., doi:10.3989/scimar.03440.22b.  Reproduction  Shortnose spurdog carry their eggs in utero and typically carry their eggs for 2 years. Reproduction is perhaps the answer to why females are so much larger than males since larger female sharks are more likely to have a larger litter size. This is because larger females produce larger embryos that therefore have a higher survival rate. The average litter size is only 2-4 and only 50% of sexually mature females reach recruitment, meaning have offspring that will settle and grow into maturity and become part of the population. This means that a simple measurement of reproduction is not an accurate method at predicting the population of this creature that possesses such a large maturation cycle.  Diet  Though sharks across separate ecosystems do favor similar diets despite their location, their diet diversity does slightly differ depending on the ecosystem. Specifically, shortnose spurdog sharks live off the east coast of Australia show an increased level in their diet diversity when compared to other population groups in Australia. Size also plays a role in diet. While larger, sexually mature sharks typically go after prize pray such as mollusks, smaller sharks rely more heavily on crustaceans. This is primarily because squids, octopuses and other mollusks on the menu for the shortnose spurdog are often free swimming and easier to catch. This makes it more difficult for smaller sharks to rely on them as a source of food. Instead the smaller shortnose spurdogs will rely on benthic prey since benthic prey live on the surface of the ocean floor.

It is also very sensitive to moisture content; too much or too little water will cause the lower leaves to brown and fall off. It likes to be kept moist, but not wet. On average, it needs frequent, small amounts of water, as opposed to an occasional, thorough watering. The plant flourishes when the temperature is in the range of 18-21 ¬∞C (65-70 ¬∞F); and will suffer if the temperature drops below 15 ¬∞C (60 ¬∞F) for prolonged periods.

Location Taveta town is wedged into a projection of Kenyan territory bordered on the north and west by Tanzania. The town lies at the border with Tanzania, directly across from the town of Holili. This is approximately , by road, west of Voi, the nearest large town, on the Arusha‚ÄìHolili‚ÄìTaveta‚ÄìVoi Road. This lies approximately , by road southeast of Nairobi, the capital and largest city in Kenya. The coordinates of the town are:3¬∞23'44.0\\"S, 37¬∞40'34.0\\"E (Latitude:-3.395565; Longitude:37.676113). In addition to Mount Kilimanjaro, Taveta also enjoys proximity to Lake Chala, a volcanic freshwater lake of extraordinary depth.  First World War  In 1914, Taveta was the scene of the first military action in East Africa between forces of the British and German empires. On 15 August, a German force of about 300 soldiers, led by Captain Tom von Prince, advanced across the border and seized the town of Taveta. The objective was both to strengthen the defence of German East Africa and to provide a base for attacks into British territory, especially on the Uganda Railway. Corporal Murimu Mwiti, leading the small group of police that were defending Tavita, stood his ground and was killed by the advancing German forces. A German officer, Friedrich Broeker, was also shot before the British force retreated. Taveta remained in German hands until it was recaptured by the British in March 1916.  Overview  Taveta thrives as a point of commerce between Kenya and Tanzania, with a twice-weekly outdoor market especially large for a town of its size. The market is fueled in part by Taveta's rail connection through Voi with the Mombasa-Nairobi-Kampala line, built during the era of British Kenya. Large numbers of people walk across the border from Tanzania to buy and sell wares in Taveta; smuggled goods such as Tanzanian rubies and coffee are occasionally available there. Taveta Town is a fast-growing town. The Town Council of Taveta has acquired a former sisal plantation for town expansion. All government border offices are located some , west of the central business district of the town, towards the border with Tanzania, with modern new office premises. The Holili/Taveta customs and immigration post is a One Stop Border Post. The current (2014) Member of Parliament for Taveta Constituency, which is largely the district and by extension the town, is Dr. Naomi Shaaban. She is a third term Member of Parliament. At one time, Taveta has had several Members of Parliament from different tribes, namely Mwacharo Kubo a taita, Norman Lukindo a kamba, Jackson Mwalulu a kamba, Alex Dingiria, Othinel Mnene, Naomi Shaaban, all Tavetas, and even a Kenyan of Greek origin, Basil Criticos. Population , the urban center had a population of 22,018. The main ethnicities in Taveta are the Taveta and Kamba tribes.

The current building was constructed by the order of Janusz Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç from 1635 to 1653 according to the design of Jan Ullrich. The building fell in ruin after the Muscovite invasion 1655‚Äì60 and remained mostly neglected for centuries. It was further devastated during World War I and only the northern wing of the palace survived. Eventually, it was restored in the 1980s and a division of the Lithuanian Art Museum is located there today. A part of the palace is still in need of renovation today. Currently, this branch of the Lithuanian National Art Museum contains Old Master paintings by Ludovico Lipparini, Guisseppe Rossi, Antonio Bellucci, Carlo Dolci, Giovanni Paolo Panini and Bartholomeus Spranger. The Palace currently is under the restoration process during which lost parts of the building will also be rebuilt. Restored buildings will be used as new exhibition halls. The project is expected to be completed in ~2023, commemorating the 700 years jubilee of the first mention of Vilnius in 1323.

Dr. Schoenfeld's own original contributions in a long research career were influenced by those of B.F. Skinner and Ivan Pavlov. In a carefully devised set of experiments in 1953 he led a team of Columbia University psychologists in discovering that anxiety caused the human heart rate to slow rather than quicken under certain timing of stimuli. He was the co-author with Fred S. Keller, a Columbia colleague, of Principles of Psychology, an influential college text published in 1950 that emphasized scientific methods in the study of psychology. Students first used it in courses at Columbia College, where the two professors offered two hours of lecture and, for the first time in psychology, four hours of laboratory work a week. Among their experiments, the students observed the responses of white rats to stimuli and rewards and measured human learning by testing people's ability to remember the pathways of mazes and other sensory processes.Root, Michael J. \\"Keller, Fred S.\\" In Carnes, Mark C., ed.

A theoretician and philosopher of photography, he was among the most prominent exponents of pictorialism. He is best known for his landscapes and photographs of various places, especially the city of Vilnius (then in Poland, now in Lithuania). He was the founder of the Wilno Photoclub and Polish Photoclub, the predecessors of the modern Union of Polish Art Photographers (ZPAF), of which he was an honorary headperson. He is also known as an ethnographer and folklorist.  Biography  Jan Bu≈Çhak was born on October 6, 1876 in Ostaszyn (), near Navahrudak (), Russian Empire (now Belarus). His parents were Walery Antoni Stanis≈Çaw Bu≈Çhak of Syrokomla and J√≥zefa n√©e Haciska of Roch, both local landowners in Ostaszyn. In the village of Woro≈Ñcza () near Navahrudak, not far from St. Ann's Roman Catholic church (), there are four graves of Jan Bu≈Çhak's ancestors. In 1888, Jan entered a gymnasium (a pre-Revolution secondary public school of the Russian Empire) in Wilno (present-day Vilnius), finishing it in 1897. From 1897 to 1899, he studied literature, history and philosophy at Jagiellonian University, Krak√≥w, but did not graduate because of lack of money. Back home, he lived in the village of Peresieka () near Minsk, where he inherited a manor after his great-uncle's death. From there, Bu≈Çhak sent his news stories to Wilno newspapers. In 1901, he married a cousin, Hanna Haciska. After his father's death, he sold the manor and bought a mansion from the Radziwi≈Ç≈Çs in Belitsa, near Minsk. On April 27, 1906, the couple had a son, Janusz Bu≈Çhak, who would become a composer and a photographer.  Photography   Beginning  Jan Bu≈Çhak grew interested in photography quite by chance in 1905, when his wife was given a camera. The same year, he took his first pictures: portraits, landscapes, environs.Gra≈ºyna Dre≈õcik, \\"Jan Bu≈Çhak\\" (DOC file), Krak√≥w, 2008. Published in conjunction with the exhibition \\"Jan Bu≈Çhak 1876-1950 - Part 2 \\", Art Historical Information from Central Europe (AHICE), 2008. (Gra≈ºyna Dre≈õcik is curator, the Walery Rzewuski Museum of History of Photography in Krak√≥w, Poland [Muzeum historii fotografii im. Walerego Rzewuskiego w Krakowie].) In the beginning, he was advised by Boles≈Çaw Ignacy Domeyko, a Navahrudak photographer, who helped him in the basics of photography. In 1908, he created a darkroom of his own in Peresieka. That December, he made his debut and won the main award at a photo competition run by ≈ªycie Ilustrowane (\\"Illustrated Life\\"), a weekly supplement to Kurier Litewski (\\"Lithuanian Courier\\").Alex Novak, \\"Jan Bulhak: Father of Modern Polish Photography \\", Vintage Works.  First successes  In 1910, Jan Bu≈Çhak participated for the first time in the World Photo Exhibition in Brussels. He corresponded with the Paris Photoclub and the French photographers Emil J. Constant Puyo, Robert de la Sizeranne, and L√©onard Misonne. Two issues of the Berlin Photographische Mitteilungen (\\"Photographic News\\") in 1910 contained his pictures. Bu≈Çhak sent his pictures and news stories to the Warsaw magazine Ziemia (\\"Earth\\") as well as to the Polish Local Lore society. He published many translations and articles in Polish magazines and inculcated the aesthetics of Pictorialism in the minds of his readers. From November 1910, Bu≈Çhak regularly contributed his writings on photography to the monthly Fotograf Warszawski (\\"Warsaw Photographer\\"). He also soon began contributing to Tygodnik Wile≈Ñski (\\"Vilnius Weekly\\") (up to 1939), and Deutscher Almanach (\\"German Almanac\\"). In 1911, Bu≈Çhak organized a photo- exhibition in Minsk. He participated in a photo exhibition in Ciechocinek, Poland; and received an honorary diploma in the category of artistic portraits at a contest in Antwerp.  Professional work  Fotographika really sticks out of the photo books from the rest due to the solid, print form, manifested not too much in the pictorial and impressionist styles of photography art, but in layouts of books. In Fotographika, Bulhak shows that he cares and draws attention through the definition of photographic reproductions. Fotographika was pioneering for the conscious consideration of form and quality of photo publications in Poland. The book shows Jan Bulhak as a person that a father figure to generations of amazing photography beginners looking to practice and aspired the called artists, as well as offering interesting contribution to reflection on the image of the artists.Jan Bulhak could also be considered as a prominent producer when it came to the concept of self-promotion and entrepreneurial organization of a photographer's activity.  Acquaintance with Ferdynand Ruszczyc  It was Bu≈Çhak's publication in Fotograf Warszawski in 1910 that drew the attention of Ferdynand Ruszczyc, a Polish painter, printmaker, and a professor at the Fine Arts Department of the Stefan Batory University (now Vilnius University); and it was Ruszczyc who helped Bu≈Çhak move to Vilnius. Later, Ruszczyc had an appreciable influence upon him as photographer. Though Bu≈Çhak's views on art, inspired by French aestheticians, had already formed, Ruszczyc helped to turn the amateur photographer into a professional: the painter taught him some specific techniques of composition to perceive nature and architecture.  Study in Germany  After this Bu≈Çhak studied photography in Dresden, Germany, where he received some practical tutoring from the German portrait-painter Hugo Erfurth. He also visited various Dresden societies, where he became acquainted with the symbolists and impressionists.  Start at Vilnius  In 1911, Ruszczyc suggested that the Vilnius Magistrate (city council) should create the position of \\"city photographer\\", and Bu≈Çhak was asked to take it. Thus, Bu≈Çhak became the Vilnius city photographer, and photography became his main business. In 1912, he opened a photographic studio at 12 Portovaya Street, Vilnius. At the request of the Vilnius Magistrate and in cooperation with the municipal curator, Bu≈Çhak started making a \\"photographic inventory\\" of the city and took pictures of its historic landmarks from 1912 to 1915.  Vilnius period  The major part of Bu≈Çhak's work is connected with Vilnius and its surroundings; he also documented the monuments and landscapes of some other parts of Poland: Warsaw, Krak√≥w, Hrodna, Lublin, and so on. Bu≈Çhak sent a series of his photos to the Vestnik fotografii (\\"Photo Bulletin\\", ) magazine, which he co-operated with from 1913 to 1914. In Bu≈Çhak's house in Eliza Orzeszkowa street, a collection of twelve thousand pictures was stored, most of them taken from 1912 to 1915. From 1919, with Ruszczyc's help and encouragement, Bu≈Çhak started lecturing on artistic photography at the Fine Arts Department of the Stefan Batory University; he would continue until 1939. In 1919, he became one of the founders and the chairman of the Vilnius Photoclub ()Mieczys≈Çaw Jackiewicz, \\"Bu≈Çhak Jan\\", Wile≈Ñska encyklopedia 1939-2005.

He and Marian Dederko were the founders of the Polish Photoclub () in 1929 or 1930. From 1919 to 1939, Jan Bu≈Çhak headed the photographic section (workshop) of the Fine Arts Department of Stefan Batory University in Vilnius. From 1935 to 1939, he was one of the editors of the magazines PrzeglƒÖd Fotograficzny (\\"Photographic Review\\") and Fotograf Polski (\\"Polish Photographer\\"). In 1939, the collection titled Polska w obrazach fotograficznych Jana Bu≈Çhaka (\\"Poland in Jan Bu≈Çhak‚Äôs photographic pictures\\") contained over 11,000 photos arranged into 158 subject albums: Vilnius, Kresy, Volhynia, Lviv, Warsaw, Krak√≥w, Pozna≈Ñ, Pomerania, Gda≈Ñsk, Nowogr√≥dek Voivodeship and others. By World War II, Bu≈Çhak had taken between 40,000 and 100,000 photographs. In 1939, he presented the collection to the Polish state, but most of these negatives perished during the war. Under the occupation during World War II, Jan Bu≈Çhak together with his son continued to photograph the destruction of many places in what was then Poland.  Last years  In 1944, after bombardments, Bu≈Çhak's studio in Vilnius burned down; about 30 thousand negatives perished, but some were spared. After World War II, in July 1945, he resettled in Warsaw.Ma≈Çgorzata Plater-Zyberk, \\"Jan Bu≈Çhak (1876‚Äì1950): Art Photographer \\", the National Museum in Warsaw, 2007. There, he took about a thousand photographs of destroyed and restored Warsaw, and about two thousand of the western land attached to Poland. Though Jan Bu≈Çhak's son Janusz studied music at the Vilnius Conservatory, the father taught him photography, so Janusz joined him in 1940s and all photographs made from 1945 to 1949 are signed \\"Jan Bu≈Çhak and son\\". In 1946, in Warsaw, with help from Stanis≈Çaw Lorentz, the director of Muzeum Narodowe w Warszawie (the National Museum), the first postwar exhibition by Jan Bu≈Çhak took place: Warszawa 1945 roku w obrazach fotograficznych Jana Bu≈Çhaka (\\"Warsaw of 1945 in Jan Bu≈Çhak's Photographic Images\\"). In 1946, he and Leonard Sempoli≈Ñski became founders of the revived Union of Polish Pictorialists (), the successor to the Polish Photoclub, and headed it until his death. His member card was number 1.Tomasz Urzykowski, \\"Nieznane zdjƒôcia znanego fotografa: z wiƒôzienia w Wilnie\\". Gazeta.pl Warszawa, 22 August 2012. Bu≈Çhak took part in more than 170 international exhibitions, and received a number of high awards. For his photograph titled Rado≈õƒá ≈ºycia (\\"Joy of Life\\"), which shows a shaded room with sun rays entering, he received the Golden Medal at the International Photographic Show () in Warsaw in 1937.Wac≈Çaw ≈ªd≈ºarski, \\"Jan Bu≈Çhak\\" (PDF). Scan from Kronika Warszawy (1978). He died suddenly in Gi≈ºycko during a photographic excursion on February 4, 1950.  Creative output  Jan Bu≈Çhak became famous and popular for his pictures of Vilnius and its vicinity, and other towns and countryside of what is now Lithuania. In the words of Tomas Venclova: > Bu≈Çhak's portrayal of Vilnius and its environs is not just documentary: > reminiscent of impressionist paintings, his valuable artistic photographs > reflect the particular aura of the Old Town and its surrounding landscape. > His image of the city has survived in the consciousness of several > generations and has become one of the city's myths. In the estimation of Laimonas Briedis: > [Bu≈Çhak] spoke of and, in his mesmerising black-and-white prints, attempted > to capture [Wilno's] sinuous nature. Bu≈Çhak placed the city onto the fluid > landscape of a human soul, and made it a challenge to the hardened, familiar > parameters of European time and space.Laimonas Briedis, Vilnius: City of > Strangers ([Vilnius]: Baltos Lankos, 2009; ), p. 13. Bu≈Çhak wrote a number of books on the technique and art of photography, memoirs of Ferdynand Ruszczyc (1939), and also some poems and short stories. He published a series of albums, Wƒôdr√≥wki fotografa (\\"Photographer's Travels\\") (I‚ÄìIX, 1931‚Äì1936). His photographs are used to illustrate a city guidebook by Juliusz K≈Ços,Juliusz K≈Ços, \\"Wilno. Przewodnik krajoznawczy\\". Wydanie trzecie poprawione po zgonie autora.

Pozna≈Ñ: Wydawnictwo Polskie, 1934. and other publications. Jan Bu≈Çhak's creativity had a great influence on the development of Lithuanian art photography. Practically all of Vilnius pictorialists adopted his views on art. This influence helped advance photography in the Vilnius area, Western Belarus, and all of Poland. Photographs by Jan Bu≈Çhak are in many Polish institutions, including the National Museum in Warsaw, the Warsaw Institute of Arts, the Museum of Fine Arts in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, the National Library of Poland, and the Walery Rzewuski Museum of History of Photography in Krak√≥w.

History Native Americans long used the fertile areas near the Red River for farming and hunting. In 1859-1860, Anglo-Americans began settling the area as the population of Native Americans dwindled. During the American Civil War, Confederate troops were stationed near Red River Station and patrolled along the south side of the Red River, the border between Texas and Indian Territory. In December 1863, a destructive Indian raid occurred which spread from Indian Territory, across the Red River at Red River Station, through Montague County and into Cooke County, Texas. The Indians were between 200 and 300 strong, and massacred a number of settler families. They were chased by the Confederate military before disappearing back into Indian Territory.Big Raid into Montague and Cooke Counties After the Civil War, cattle drives began moving from south and central Texas to Kansas, and Red River Station was the last stop in Texas on the Chisolm Trail. Virtually all cattle driven along the Chisolm Trail crossed at Red River Station. The town grew and citizens applied for a post office in 1873, initially naming it Salt Creek. In 1884, the post office's name changed to Red River Station, but the post office and the community were short-lived. When the Gainesville, Henrietta and Western Railway (1886‚Äì87) crossed northern Montague County, its right-of-way crossed south of Red River Station, through present-day Nocona and Belcherville. As towns sprang up along the new rail line and with the end to the cattle drives, Red River Station faced extinction. A tornado also struck in the late 1880s, destroying much of the community. Rather than rebuild, citizens moved south to the communities along the new rail line and Red River Station again became farm land. In 1887, the post office closed and the community ceased to exist. Today, nothing remains of the former community except the cemetery. Education Red River Station is served by the Prairie Valley Independent School District. Historical landmarks Red River Station received a historic marker in 1963 commemorating the settlement established on the Red River. In 2009, a marker was unveiled for the Chisholm Trail. Red River Station cemetery is located west of Salt Creek and due south of the Red River.

Pye (; October 21, 1921 ‚Äì September 5, 2008) was an American political scientist, sinologist and comparative politics expert considered one of the leading China scholars in the United States. Educated at Carleton College and Yale University, Pye chose to focus on the characteristics of specific cultures in forming theories of political development of modernization of Third World nations, rather than seeking universal and overarching theories like most political scientists. As a result, he became regarded as one of the foremost contemporary practitioners and proponents of the concept of political culture and political psychology. Pye was a teacher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for 35 years and served on several Asia-related research and policy organizations. He wrote or edited books and served as advisor to Democratic presidential candidates, including John F. Kennedy. Pye died of pneumonia at age 86. Early life Lucian W. Pye was born on October 21, 1921 in Fenzhou, in Shanxi Province in northwest China. His father, Watts O. Pye, a graduate of Carleton College, and his mother, Gertrude Chaney Pye, were Congregational missionaries of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. When his father died in 1926, he and his mother stayed in Fenzhou until he moved to Oberlin, Ohio for his high school education.Guide To The Carleton-In-China Collection Pye lost much of his grasp of the Chinese language upon moving to Ohio, only to take it up again later.Martin, Douglas. \\"Lucian W. Pye, bold thinker on Asia, is dead at 86.\\" The New York Times, September 11, 2008. Retrieved September 12, 2008. Pye graduated in 1943 from Carleton College, where he met Mary Toombs Waddill, of Greenville, South Carolina; they married in 1945, and she would co-write and help edit many of his books and writings over the years.\\"MIT professor Lucian W. Pye, leading China scholar, dies at 86.\\" MIT News, September 8, 2008. Retrieved on September 12, 2008. Pye returned to China at the end of World War II to become an intelligence officer with the U.S. Marines Corps, achieving the rank of second lieutenant. He returned to the United States to attend graduate school through the G.I. Bill at Yale University, where he was introduced to comparative politics by his mentor, political scientist Gabriel Almond. Almond later said Pye \\"generally (left) me a little breathless; he had so much energy and enthusiasm.\\" During his time at Yale, Pye worked with other significant political scientists like Almond, Harold Lasswell and Nathan Leites in exploring the psychological, sociological and anthropological elements of international affairs, rather than the standard and accepted \\"realism\\" approach. Pye wrote his dissertation on the attitudes underlying the warlord system of politics in China during the 1920s and earned his Ph.D. in 1951. Career Early in his career, Pye worked with other political scientists to free the field from academic constraints placed upon them by the era of Senator Joseph McCarthy. In 1956, Pye joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Center for International Studies as a teacher in a new program, which eventually developed into a political science department, partially due to Pye's assistance. He taught political science at the M.I.T. for 35 years, particularly focusing on China and other Asian nations. M.I.T. officials said he was one of only a few scholars who studied Asian politics from a comparative standpoint, and he served as a mentor to several generations of students who went on to prominent positions in academia and government. Among his Ph.D. graduate students were Richard H. Solomon and Susan Shirk, both of whom were political scientists who served in the United States government, and Richard Samuels. Pye helped found the Committee on Comparatives Politics for the Social Science Research Council, along with other social scientists seeking alternative explanations for change than those offered by Marxism. Pye became one of the pioneers in the 1950s and 1960s in developing theories about the political development and modernization of Third World nations. His primary intellectual interest was to explore the cultural differences that help explain why politics differ so greatly from one nation to another. Unlike most political scientists of his day who sought universal and overarching theories, Pye focused on specific cultures, countries and people in order to create more individualized interpretations. Richard Samuels, an M.I.T. political scientist who worked with Pye, said he helped foster a new manner of thinking in post-World War II social science by \\"redirected political science away from rational models of political behavior and toward things that are harder to measure and understand.\\" His daughter later recalled that he once said, \\"only half in jest,\\" that \\"political scientists are all failed novelists,\\" meaning that \\"academics shared with artists the impulse to tell a story, but that statistics, studies and even firsthand fact-finding alone made an incomplete picture.\\" Virginia Pye, \\"China Of My Mind,\\" New York Times (December 29, 2013) Pye's approach was so novel that it often drew opposite reactions and criticism, but he nevertheless came to be considered a peer of the Chinese experts of his generation, like John K. Fairbank of Harvard. Pye advised the Department of State and the National Security Council in China-related matters. He also served as an advisor to Democratic presidential candidates, Senators John F. Kennedy and Henry M. Jackson, and urged both men to pursue a muscular foreign policy. He was an early proponent of the Vietnam War. Pye served as a leader, and eventually acting chairman, with the National Committee on United States-China Relations, where he helped lay the groundwork for the American table tennis team visit to China in 1971. Pye served on several private organizations in which scholars, government experts and intellectuals discussed Asia-related research and policy, including the Council on Foreign Relations, the Asia Society and the Asia Foundation. Pye supported the Social Science Research Council in the establishment of the Universities Service Center, a scholarly center in Hong Kong. He also conducted research in Malaysia, which he used to suggest the appeal of communism in that nation came from insecurity over the pace of change. Pye also worked in Burma, where he concluded psychology was more important than economics in explaining development. Pye was no proponent of Counter-insurgency methods like the Hamlet Program. He emphasised the \\"need to create more effective, more adaptive, more complex, and more rationalised organisations\\" and saw the \\"heart\\" of the nation-building \\"problem\\" centered on the \\"interrelationships among personality, culture, and the polity\\". ARPA counterinsurgency research programs, such as the one done by Simulmatics Corporation, part of Project Agile, relied heavily on Pye's work. (One of his mentors, Harold Lasswell, had studied under Sigmund Freud.) He applied this psychological approach to his 1976 biography of Mao Zedong, who he imagined as a child and argued Mao Zedong's rebellious attitude stemmed from a desire to recapture his \\"infantile omnipotence.\\" Donald L. M. Blackmer, writing in the journal Political Science and Politics, cited the Mao Zedong biography as an example of Pye's tendency to use leaps of imagination: \\"Interpretation and generalization abound, often unsupported by the sorts of evidence most of us have been taught to look for.\\" Blackmer said the benefit of this approach was that Pye could \\"explain the otherwise inexplicable.\\" In 1996, Pye revealed his underlying diagnosis that Mao Zedong was \\"probably a narcissist with a borderline personality\\" after The Private Life of Chairman Mao was published by Mao's doctor of 22 years.Lucian W. Pye, Rethinking the Man in the Leader, The China Journal 35 (January 1996): 107‚Äì112. In 1985, Pye and his wife wrote Asian Power and Politics: The Cultural Dimensions of Authority, which discussed commonalities in Asia' disparate political cultures. Critics of the book accused Pye of using flagrant stereotypes; Howard Wriggins, writing in Political Science Quarterly, asked, \\"Who but Lucian Pye would be bold enough\\" to undertake such a publication. Pye went on to serve as president of the American Political Science Association from 1988 to 1989. Death Pye died on September 5, 2008 in Boston, Massachusetts at age 86. His health had gradually deteriorated after a fall the previous July, but the immediate cause of his death was pneumonia. He was survived by his wife of 63 years, the former Mary Waddill; his daughters Lyndy Pye of Northampton, Massachusetts and Virginia Pye of Richmond, Virginia; his son, Chris, of Northampton; and three grandchildren, Anna Swann-Pye (one of the three musicians in folk group String of Birds), and Eva and Daniel Ravenal. Separate memorial services were in Belmont, Massachusetts and at M.I.T. Charles Stewart, head of the M.I.T. political science department, said of Pye upon his death, \\"Lucian was a giant in the intellectual world that went well beyond our field of political science.

He is most known for his book Noticia de la California, a standard geographical, historical, and ethnographic description of Baja California, Mexico‚Äîa region he never personally visited.  Biography  Miguel Venegas was born in Puebla, New Spain. He received an academic degree prior to joining the Jesuit order, which he did in 1700 in Tepotzotl√°n. Five years later he was an ordained member and he taught philosophy and moral theology at the Colegio S. Pedro y S. Pablo de M√©xico. He suffered from health problems and bodily swellings, which obliged him to retire to the Jesuit ranch of Chicomocelo, where he devoted himself to writing and botany until his death in 1764. As a historian, he was cautious in his investigations, critical in his selection of sources and concerned with discovering the truth. In his major work on California, he cited Georg Marcgraf and Willem Piso's Historia Naturalis Brasiliae (1648), an important compendium on flora and fauna in Brazil, which circulated widely in northern Europe and beyond.Neil Safier, \\"Beyond Brazilian Nature: The Editorial Itineraries of Marcgraf and Piso's Historia Naturalis Brasiliae, in Michiel Van Groesen, The Legacy of Dutch Brazil, New York: Cambridge University Press 2014, p. 171. Published works Map of Baja California, from the 1766 French edition of Noticia de la California. In the mid-1730s, he was assigned the task of writing an account of Baja California. This seems to have been, at least in part, to counter the setback to the missionaries' efforts and reputation caused by the Peric√∫ revolt on the southernmost part of the peninsula in 1734. The historian was given access to the missionaries' correspondence and reports, and he was able to exchange letters with them to acquire further information, which he did through the use of questionnaires. Venegas' 600-page manuscript, Empresas Apost√≥licas, was completed in 1739. It was sent to Spain, but it languished there rather than seeing publication because it was too detailed with regard to military matters. Another Jesuit historian, Andr√©s Marcos Burriel, extensively revised Venegas' manuscript in the 1750s, and it was finally published in 1757 as Noticia de la California in three volumes at Madrid. This work by Venegas and Burriel was subsequently translated into English (1759), Dutch (1761‚Äì1762), French (1766‚Äì1767), and German (1769‚Äì1770), and it became the standard source for information about the early Californias. The original manuscript version was published in a facsimile edition in 1979. Venegas was a prolific writer, also authoring biographical and theological treatises. Among his other works are a manual on how to administer the sacraments, which remained the official ritual for the Mexican branch of the Catholic church (1731), a biography of Juan Mar√≠a de Salvatierra (1754a, 1929) and another biography detailing the life of Juan Bautista Zappa (1754b). Many of these were edited extensively before publication due to Venegas' writing style, which was too lengthy for his fellow Jesuits.  List of books by Venegas  *1731.

This means that Hiro is able to alter the flow of time, teleport and time travel. In the show, he is played by Japanese-American actor Masi Oka. According to the online comic on NBC.com, Hiro is named after Hiroshima, so that his family will always remember the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Tim Kring has been quoted as saying, \\"It's no coincidence we named him Hiro... he truly is on a hero's quest.\\" To this end, his name is often used as a pun. His co-worker and best friend Ando once called him \\"Super-Hiro\\" in jest.  Character development  Hiro was one of the last main characters to be created by Tim Kring; he was added to the pilot episode after Kring's wife noticed none of the existing main characters were happy about their powers. During a panel session, Kring explained that he developed Hiro as a comic book geek \\"trapped in a life that was kind of not of his making\\". Thus, viewers were introduced to Hiro as an office worker in a sea of cubicles. In an interview, Tim Kring noted, \\"I didn't start off by saying I want a guy who can teleport. I started off by saying I wanted a guy who felt trapped in a life that was not his dream and what could be a power that would be most wish-fulfilling for that character? And that was the ability to teleport out of that life.\\" Fictional character synopsis Hiro Nakamura is an office worker, specifically a level-3 programmer at Yamagato Industries, living in Tokyo, Japan who one day discovers he has the power to bend time and space. An otaku, Hiro is an avid fan of superheroes and science fiction. Na√Øve and over-eager, Hiro is the one character that aspires to the pure heroism of comic book crime fighters, shouldering the responsibility to use his powers for good. His best friend is the skeptical Ando Masahashi. At the start, Hiro is only able to speak Japanese, relying on Ando as his translator, but as the series progresses, his English slowly develops. Hiro's Blog, maintained by NBC and written from Hiro's point of view, was updated after each new episode aired, usually about the events of the episode. Genesis At the start of the series, Hiro's power is developed enough for him to turn the second-hand of his clock back one second. It is later discovered that this same power made a train fourteen seconds late. Ecstatic at these accomplishments, Hiro confides in his friend, Ando, who is extremely skeptical of Hiro's new abilities. At Ando's suggestion, Hiro teleports himself into the women's bathroom of a local club, though Ando is not looking at the time. Seeing Hiro dragged out of the bathroom, Ando states that this only proves that he is a pervert, and a crestfallen Hiro walks away as Ando yells sarcastically that he is a \\"Super Hiro!\\" As Hiro returns home on the train, he sees a vacation ad for New York City. At this point, Hiro's power inadvertently activates, teleporting him to Times Square. Hiro appears extremely happy to have successfully used his ability. He soon discovers a comic book called 9th Wonders! in a nearby newsstand that shows himself standing in Times Square with his hands up and yelling, \\"Yatta!\\" (meaning \\"I did it!\\"), an incredibly accurate depiction of Hiro's arrival in New York. He attempts to pay in Japanese yen and runs off with the comic book. Hiro then discovers that the story includes what has already happened between himself and Ando, and his discovery of his abilities. Hiro decides to find the artist and writer, Isaac Mendez, by visiting his loft. Hiro visits Isaac's loft, discovering the artist's dead body, partially decapitated with the brain removed. Hiro is arrested by the police and during the interrogation discovers he has traveled not only through space, but through time as well. It was October 2 when he left Tokyo, and he arrived in New York November 8. Just as Hiro discovers this, he witnesses a cataclysmic explosion. Before the blast reaches him, Hiro returns to the train he was on at the moment he left Tokyo, still holding the comic he picked up in the future. After going to the future, Hiro decides that he must save the world by preventing the explosion. Hiro then persuades Ando that his powers are genuine by saving a young girl from an oncoming car (as predicted by the comic book from the future). They take a plane to Los Angeles, but go the rest of the way by car, because that is what the comic book says they do. Hiro and Ando then have several misadventures in Las Vegas, starting when Ando decides to hit the casinos. Ando convinces Hiro to use his powers to cheat, stopping time to give Ando winning hands in poker games. The two make a lot of money but are later thrown out of the casino and then beaten up by a player they had cheated. After an argument, Hiro and Ando go their own separate ways. Hiro ends up in a diner near Las Vegas where he sees Nathan Petrelli land after escaping from Noah Bennet and the Haitian. After Nathan enters the diner, Hiro briefly talks with the man, and Nathan decides to give Hiro a ride back to the casino, where he and Ando are reunited. Their attempts to call Isaac Mendez are finally successful, as Peter Petrelli answers the phone, relaying a message from Hiro's future self, and tells them \\"Save the cheerleader, save the world\\" and to come to New York City. However, the pair are detained further when the same player they cheated earlier forces them to play a poker game to make money to repay what they gained before. Ando and Hiro manage to escape shortly before the other players are slaughtered by Jessica Sanders. Hiro is crestfallen that he is unable to prevent their deaths but is comforted by Ando, who claims Hiro is still beginning his journey to become a true hero. Hiro exercises his power as a hero again when he and Ando run across D.L. Hawkins and his son, Micah, at the scene of a burning car wreck with a passenger trapped inside. As D.L. frees the passenger, the vehicle explodes and Hiro freezes time to save them. Hiro complains about not having super strength when he is forced to drag the pair away from the explosion. After he unfreezes time, he shows the future edition of 9th Wonders! to Micah and speaks to him in English about his space- time manipulation powers. Continuing their journey to New York, Hiro and Ando stop at a diner in Texas and meet a waitress named Charlie, who recently developed powers of her own. As Hiro talks to Charlie, who finds him to be \\"sweet,\\" Sylar watches them talk. Charlie is later found murdered in the diner's storeroom with her brain removed, just as Hiro had found Isaac's body in New York. Not wanting to fail to save someone like he did in Las Vegas, Hiro goes back in time in an attempt to prevent her murder, promising Ando that he'll return in five seconds. Hiro's attempt to teleport to the day before Charlie's death goes awry, landing him six months in the past, on the day of Charlie's birthday. Though he considers another time-travel attempt, the possibility of being eaten by a dinosaur dissuades him. Hiro tries to warn Charlie and protect her from the \\"very bad man\\", but ends up forming a close relationship with her after his attempts to convince her fail. Eventually, he asks her to come with him to Japan. As the date of their departure gets closer, Charlie reveals that she has a blood clot in her brain and will die no matter what. She says she was going to give up before Hiro came and that she has fallen in love with him. Just as they are about to kiss, Hiro inadvertently teleports to Japan some time after he and Ando had left for the United States. Unable to return via his own powers, he is forced to make his way back to the diner through normal means. Ando, happy to see Hiro again, assumes Hiro used his powers (not least because Hiro now appears in a photograph on the Diner's wall taken with Charlie six months previously) and was successful, but Hiro explains that he failed and made his way back through public transportation. After this incident, Hiro's powers appear to weaken. The novel Heroes: Saving Charlie expands and changes the events of the history. Hiro's love story with Charlie is expanded, as is her own role in foretelling her demise. They dated and fell in love during the months Hiro teleported back to, and eventually, he told her that her memory was a power like his own. He did convince her to go to Japan with him, and they ended up in the same bar where Hiro has first told Ando his mission was to save the cheerleader, and save the world. Charlie realized Hiro lied to her (he had told her his mission was to save her life) and went back to the U.S. because she believed saving the world was a more important destiny for Hiro than saving just her. In \\"Fallout\\", Hiro and Ando find their way to Claire's high school, but arrive after Sylar's attack and believe her to have already been killed. Ando tries to be optimistic about the situation, claiming that \\"save the cheerleader, save the world,\\" is just a progression of events ‚Äî save the cheerleader and then save the world ‚Äî and not a conditional statement. Hiro doesn't accept the claim, believing that he would have meant it as a conditional statement. While thinking about their next move, Hiro is called by Isaac Mendez, who arranges a meeting with them in Texas. Once they meet, Hiro shows Isaac the future 9th Wonders! comic, much to the artist's surprise, then asks him to paint the future. At first, Isaac isn't convinced he can do so without drugs, but once he realizes that some of his rough sketches depict Hiro traveling back to save Charlie, he tries again. Hiro recommends that Isaac concentrate, using the same face he makes when activating his own powers, and Isaac manages to activate his power successfully. Isaac's painting depicts Hiro brandishing a sword while encountering a carnivorous theropod dinosaur, seemingly confirming Hiro's earlier fears. Hiro remarks, \\"I really need to find that sword.\\" Two weeks later, at the beginning of \\"Godsend\\", Hiro and Ando go to the Museum of Natural History, looking for the sword that Hiro saw in Isaac's painting. They find it in a glass case on the back of an ancient warrior, Takezo Kensei. On the hilt of the sword is the symbol that appears in various points throughout the series. Hiro recalls a story his father told him of Kensei and how the sword was believed to have benefited him. He decides to steal the sword, believing it will help him control his powers. While doing so, he brandishes it against a model dinosaur in the museum, mimicking the picture Isaac had drawn earlier. However, the museum's version of the sword is only a wooden replica made by the Linderman Group. He returns to Isaac's loft, where he meets Simone Deveaux. Hiro also happily re- encounters Nathan (whom he addresses as \\"flying man\\"). After introductions and brief discussions, Simone recommends Hiro go back to Las Vegas with the dinosaur painting and see Mr. Linderman, an avid collector of Isaac's paintings. In \\"The Fix\\", Hiro and Ando are chased by unknown men. Eventually, they are captured by the men, and Hiro is told that the men work for someone \\"truly powerful.\\" Hiro and Ando are then told to stop their quest. Hiro declines, even after being offered first class plane tickets back to Japan. The men state their boss won't be happy and bring the two to him. Hiro then realizes the men work for his father, Kaito. In \\"Distractions\\", Hiro's father tries to convince him to go back to Tokyo, admitting that it was a bad idea to start him off at the bottom and offering him a job as Executive Vice President of the company. After Hiro's initial refusal, his father rips up Isaac's painting. Kimiko, Hiro's sister, admits to him that, though his father is too proud to admit it, the company has gone through hard times. Ando reminds him that his powers are declining and it might not be a bad idea. Hiro eventually convinces his father that his sister is a better candidate to take over the company. Mr. Nakamura then lets Hiro continue with the mission. In \\"Run!\\", Hiro and Ando are again sidetracked by a weeping Las Vegas showgirl named Hope. Hiro and Ando get separated while trying to retrieve a bag for Hope. Hiro is locked in a closet by Hope, then later freed by a Gaming Commission agent, who is looking for her. After watching Ando get shot during a firefight between the agent and Hope in \\"Unexpected\\", Hiro feels his mission is too dangerous to bring Ando any further. Hiro defeats Hope by unexpectedly using his powers to reverse the bullet in time one second, sending it back into the gun, disarming Hope. She and the agent are arrested, but since Hiro had his eyes closed, he doesn't realize he used his powers (which haven't been working well lately). He leaves the Versa with Ando and boards a bus alone (greeted by comic icon Stan Lee playing the bus driver). In \\"Parasite\\", Hiro tries to enter Linderman's casino, but becomes aware that he has been red-flagged and is not to enter the casino. As Nathan Petrelli enters the casino to meet with Linderman, he uses his influence to help Hiro get inside. Hiro delivers the painting to Mr. Linderman's vault, where the vault curator accepts it. While the curator is in another room, Hiro locates the sword and steals it, with the help of Ando, disguised as a security guard. Hiro teleports them both out of the building to escape the other security guards, but they find themselves on top of the Deveaux building, in a post-apocalyptic New York five years after the explosion. In \\".07%\\", Hiro decides to learn as much as he can about the future to know what went wrong with his attempts to stop the bomb. He and Ando enter Isaac's apartment, but find it netted with newspaper articles suspended on strings, each article relating to the explosion and even the heroes themselves. Just then, Hiro and Ando hear a sound, and Hiro takes out his sword to confront whoever it is, but is shocked when he comes face to face with his future self. In \\"Five Years Gone\\", Hiro learns from his future self that the bomb still went off. The younger Hiro, in turn, reveals to his future self that the present-day Claire was rescued and Sylar got caught, but Sylar himself wasn't killed yet. This gives Future Hiro hope, but before they can do anything about it, Matt Parkman and his Homeland Security team break into Isaac's loft and begin a raid. Ando and Future Hiro manage to escape, but present-day Hiro is apprehended by Matt and the Haitian. Hiro is brutally interrogated by Matt, who doesn't believe he is telling the truth about time traveling. Mohinder Suresh is called in to investigate Isaac's loft, where he is convinced about Hiro's story, but fails to convince the President, Nathan Petrelli (who is, in fact, Sylar in disguise). The President orders Mohinder to kill present-day Hiro, but Mohinder finds he can't bring himself to do it. In the meantime, Ando and Future Hiro enlist the aid of future Peter Petrelli and they break into the building Present Hiro is captured in. They defeat all the guards and with the aid of Mohinder, manage to rescue Hiro. Unfortunately, before Hiro and Ando manage to travel back to their time, Future Hiro is shot by Matt Parkman, who is, in turn, stopped by Peter, who uses telekinesis to close the door on Parkman. Hiro is shocked to see his future self die, but when Ando confides he believes in Hiro now and shows him a copy of the 9th Wonders! comic book in which Hiro stabs Sylar with his sword, Hiro gets his confidence back and travels back to the time from which they came. In \\"The Hard Part\\", upon their return to the present timeline, Hiro proudly vows to New York City that he'll do his best to save it. However, he does realize it will be the hard part of his destiny. Hiro and Ando return to Isaac's loft, hoping to fill in the gaps of the futuristic comic book. However, they arrive to find that Isaac has been killed by Sylar. When Hiro and Ando hear Sylar in the bathroom, they hide behind a painting. Sylar hears their heartbeats and uncovers their hiding spot. However, Hiro teleports Ando and himself to safety before they are found. Hiro and Ando continue to follow Sylar and watch him meet with his mother, attempting to reconcile with her. After Sylar's mother is accidentally killed, Hiro stops time and approaches Sylar, sword drawn. However, as he swings, time resumes and Sylar grabs Hiro's sword. Sylar begins to freeze the sword, and ‚Äì as Hiro teleports to safety with Ando ‚Äì it breaks in two. In \\"Landslide\\", after Ando looks in the Yellow Pages for someone who can repair the sword, he finds an ad bearing the helix symbol seen throughout the series. Upon arriving, they encounter Hiro's father Kaito, who tells Hiro that he is worthy of the family destiny. He also trains Hiro to fight and kill with a sword. When Hiro is done training, he and Kaito discover that Ando, thinking that Kaito had convinced Hiro to return to Japan, bought a nagamaki and has left to confront Sylar alone. In \\"How to Stop an Exploding Man\\" Hiro teleports to Isaac's loft to find Ando about to be killed by Sylar, but manages to teleport them both out of danger and back to Japan. Hiro switches weapons with Ando, claiming that \\"'It is not the sword. It is the man.' This man is ready.\\" Upon returning, he impales Sylar with the nagamaki. Sylar uses the last of his strength to send fling Hiro toward a building, forcing Hiro to teleport to save himself. In doing so, however, he sends himself three centuries into the past to Kyoto, Japan, circa 1671. Upon collecting himself, he finds himself caught in the middle of a battle between a small group of samurai about to attack a figure on the horizon, who appears to be Kensei himself. Before the battle begins, however, an eclipse shadows the scene. Generations In \\"Four Months Later...\\", the premiere episode of Season 2, Hiro freezes time as the archers from the battle scene at the end of \\"How to Stop an Exploding Man\\" are about to kill him. He then teleports who he believes to be Takezo Kensei away from the battle and into a small forest. There, he learns that the man is a decoy, and that the real Kensei, an Englishman in samurai armor, had been hiding in a tree in order to snipe the enemy with a crossbow. After some conversation, Hiro realizes that, by interfering in the battle, he has changed the past, and Otsu is razed. The swordsmith's daughter, a woman named Yaeko, who Kensei was supposed to wed according to the legend, grows angry at Kensei and takes back her father's sword given as payment, saying that she will go fight the bandits herself. Kensei reacts to this with general apathy. In \\"Lizards\\", Hiro impersonates Kensei by donning his armor in order to make sure the bandits don't kill Yaeko and to prove to her that Kensei is a hero. Scaring off the bandits using his powers, Hiro as Kensei wins the heart of Yaeko. Encountering the real Kensei afterwards, Hiro manages to convince him to help Yaeko rescue her father. However, as they are about to leave, the bandits return and fire arrows at Kensei, seemingly killing him. However, once the arrows are removed, Kensei regenerates in a fashion similar to Claire Bennet. With Kensei's newly discovered power, Hiro realizes how he became the hero of legend. Since Kensei isn't quite ready to accept his destiny, Hiro forces him to play out another of his legends, this one the retrieval of the \\"fire scroll\\" from 90 angry r≈çnin. The task convinces Kensei to take up his own mantle, and he likens Hiro to his conscience ‚Äî except he pays attention to Hiro. Believing his task to be done, Hiro initially decides to return to his own time, but during the attempt, suddenly stops and returns to Kensei. Hiro, determined to preserve the timeline, decides to remain in feudal Japan until Kensei defeats White Beard and saves Japan. They locate White Beard's army camp and Hiro helps Kensei rescue Yaeko's father. However, in a moment of weakness, Hiro gives into his own desires and confesses his love to Yaeko and they kiss, unaware that Kensei is watching them. Hiro tries to apologize, but Kensei reverts to his old ways and knocks Hiro unconscious and turns him, Yaeko, and her father over to White Beard's soldiers. According to Hiro's note to Ando, this causes a currently unknown alteration to the timeline. Hiro is kept prisoner in White Beard's camp where they use opium to dull his senses, preventing him from using his powers. Yaeko manages to free herself from her shackles and removes the opium. Hiro is able to focus just enough to teleport them to safety. Later, Hiro returns to White Beard's camp to destroy the guns. Before he can set the gunpowder cache on fire, Kensei confronts him and the two engage in a sword fight. Hiro tries to persuade Kensei to join him to stop White Beard, but Kensei refuses, and vows to Hiro that as long as he lives, he will destroy everything he holds dear. Hiro teleports out right before the guns explode. He meets Yaeko under the cherry blossoms one last time, and tells her the final tale in the legend of Kensei, where he is forced to cut his heart out. Yaeko vows that as long as she has a breath in her body, she will tell his story as the story of Takezo Kensei. They share a final kiss, and Hiro teleports out, leaving Yaeko alone under the cherry blossoms. Hiro then teleports back to the present day, effectively fulfilling the final task by leaving Yaeko behind, and he learns from Ando that his father has been killed. Hiro attempts to go back and prevent his death in \\"Cautionary Tales\\", but his father convinces him that they cannot play God with their gifts. Hiro accepts this advice, but uses the opportunity to learn that Kensei was the one responsible for murdering his father. In \\"Truth & Consequences\\", Hiro is able to learn more about Kensei and his new name, Adam Monroe. He travels back in time to 1977 and learns that Adam was imprisoned by his father after he almost releases a virus that could kill everything. He learns that the virus will be kept in the Primatech facility in Odessa, Texas. Determined to avenge his father's murder, he teleports to the facility with his sword and stops time. There, he sees Peter Petrelli for the first time since \\"How to Stop an Exploding Man\\". Hiro declares his intentions to Peter, but Peter refuses to let Hiro harm Adam. Peter's hand crackles with electricity as Hiro lets out a battle cry and charges with his sword drawn. In \\"Powerless\\", Hiro confronts Peter, but is knocked unconscious. Later, he is reunited with Nathan Petrelli and Matt Parkman, who are there to stop Peter and Adam from getting the virus. Hiro teleports into the vault and confronts Adam for the first time since the tent in White Beard's camp. Hiro tells Adam he should not have let Adam live long ago, then grabs Adam and teleports him away. Hiro later reveals to Ando that Adam will not hurt anyone ever again. The scene cuts to Adam, locked in a casket, buried alive in a Japanese cemetery. Villains In the third volume, \\"Villains\\", Hiro has taken his father's place as head of Yamagato. His family's lawyer gives him a tape his father recorded, telling Hiro that in the office safe is one half of a formula that could destroy the world if it fell into the wrong hands. Out of curiosity, he opens the safe and the envelope containing the formula, which is then stolen by a speeding superhuman named Daphne. Her super speed negates his ability to freeze time, and she escapes by knocking him unconscious. Hiro travels to the future to validate his father's claim, where he sees Tokyo destroyed by some undefined cataclysm. He also witnesses his future self being killed by Ando, who now possesses some sort of electricity-based power (later found to be power amplification). This makes Hiro distrustful of Ando. To stop this future, Hiro and Ando follow Daphne to her home in France. However, Hiro is unable to capture her as she threatens to kill Ando. Using a tracking device, they follow Daphne to Berlin, Germany, where the other half of the formula is. The Haitian is holding it, so Hiro and Ando knock him unconscious to steal it, only to have Daphne speed in and steal it first. The Haitian awakens and captures them before they can pursue her. Hiro and Ando are locked in Level 2 of the company, where they resolve their differences over Ando killing Hiro in the future. They are released by Angela Petrelli, who scolds Hiro for losing both halves of the formula. Ando supports Hiro and declares they will get the formula back. To accomplish this, Hiro and Ando dig up Adam Monroe. Adam leads Hiro to a bar under the impression that they can find information there, but it is just a ruse for Adam to escape. He tricks the bartender into knocking Hiro out, then flees. Depressed, they decide to drink at a bar where they meet Daphne and Knox, who captured Adam. Knox says that he will let Hiro join them if he kills Ando, considering Ando, a normal human, useless to their causes. Hiro uses his powers to travel back in time, retrieving a packet of fake blood and a retractable sword to make it look as if he really killed Ando. This convinces Daphne and Knox. Daphne sends Hiro to Africa to find a precognitive painter named Usutu. After two failed attempts to catch the painter using his powers, Hiro decides to use conventional methods, which Usutu had been waiting for him to do, as he had been overly reliant on his ability. He then shows Hiro a montage of those Hiro has to fight; namely Arthur Petrelli and his newly assembled team of villains. Hiro and Ando are given food from Usutu to induce a spirit walk, which causes Hiro to witness Arthur Petrelli's past, among other things. Arthur discovers this and teleports to Africa, killing Usutu and wiping Hiro's mind, leaving him under the impression that he is only ten years old. Ando barely manages to get the mind-wiped Hiro to teleport them to safety. With Hiro's memory gone, Ando is forced to reacquaint Hiro with his powers. After a series of tests (mixed with some of Hiro's childish pranks) in a Tokyo bowling alley, the duo teleport to Sam's Comics, which Hiro claims is the source of all knowledge. Ando finds yet another prophetic issue of 9th Wonders! which depicts the very situation that he and Hiro are in. The book also depicts a solar eclipse, with the caption, \\"It's Coming...,\\" in the corner. The comic directs the duo to Matt Parkman, who can presumably restore Hiro's memory. Matt, however, cannot even understand Hiro, much less fix him, and instead enlists Hiro's help in finding Daphne, which the comic also depicts. When the eclipse causes both Hiro and Matt to lose their powers, Matt loses faith in his ability to help Daphne. In his own childish way, Hiro successfully convinces Matt to save Daphne. While Matt goes to Daphne, Hiro and Ando track down the nearest Sam's Comics to find the new issue of 9th Wonders!. The proprietors are surprised when the issue depicts Hiro and Ando asking for it. Wanting to read up on his life, Hiro uses his credit card to purchase all the back issues of the 9th Wonders! comic; however, after seeing all the death that occurs when he tries to be a hero, he locks himself in the restroom. The shop owner talks him around and Hiro leaves the restroom. The other employee points out a panel in the first issue showing present-day Hiro and Claire Bennet looking through the glasshouse at Kaito Nakamura handing baby Claire over to Noah. Copying the comic, Hiro tracks down Claire, saving the Bennets in the process by teleporting Sylar and Elle to a beach, and takes Claire back to the moment the comic depicts. While watching their past selves, Hiro learns that his mother has the ability to heal, and possesses the \\"catalyst\\" that was intended for Claire. Hiro reveals himself to his mother, and she heals his memory. He convinces her to give him the catalyst, pledging to protect it. However, Arthur Petrelli appears, stealing his ability and the catalyst. He throws Hiro off the roof and returns to the present after sending Claire back to the future. Hiro manages to climb up back to the balcony, he then seeks the help of his younger self to obtain the formula from his father. They're both caught in the act by his father who sends young Hiro to bed and then attacks present day Hiro believing he's just a thief. Hiro tears the formula in half just as his father strikes, accounting for it being torn in half in the present. He is rescued by Daphne and Ando, the latter having gained the power to supercharge the abilities of others; with Ando's help, Daphne can essentially run through time. Once in the present, Hiro and Daphne travel back to the Pinehearst Company to recover the formula. Tracy is about to leave with the formula, so Hiro apologizes to her in advance before punching her in the face and grabbing the formula. Daphne takes him back to their friends and he destroys the formula once and for all. Fugitives Hiro, powerless, is back in Japan with Ando. He bought an abandoned fire station from the city as their headquarters. After injecting him with a GPS device and revealing the Ando- cycle, Ando tells Hiro that he feels that he's trying to live through him since he is currently powerless. After Hiro denies this, Ando leaves frustrated. Later while talking to Ando on the phone, Hiro is captured by Nathan's agents. Then Hiro is awakened by Claire on a plane with other captured people with abilities. Due to a battle with Peter and the soldiers on it, the plane crashes with everyone inside. Hiro survives and runs for his life together with Mohinder Suresh and Matt Parkman. Meanwhile, Ando is getting worried and tries to get to Arkansas, where the plane crashed. He is visited by Daphne who worries about the kidnapped Matt and runs to Arkansas together with Ando. They are quickly reunited but Daphne gets shot by Hunter's agents. Hiro, Ando, Matt and Mohinder escape again from the soldiers and are also reunited with Peter Petrelli. Hiro gets handed some drawings of Matt which reveal that he and Ando are to go to India. On the dawning stand Hiro, an unknown blond girl and a man. Hiro believes he must find a sword there so he can regain his lost powers. In \\"Building 26\\", he and Ando travel to India and realize that the blond girl is a future bride who doesn't want to get married but accepts it because of her grandfather's wishes. Ando convinces the bride to stop the wedding which upsets Hiro because he is no longer the hero on a quest. While on the bride's coffee house, Ando gets kidnapped by the groom and will kill him if the wedding is not celebrated. During the wedding Hiro stops it and defends the bride with a knife thus fulfilling Matt's painting as he realizes that he doesn't need powers to be a hero. The wedding is off and while he and Ando are reunited in the coffee house they receive a message from Rebel, telling them that they must save Matt Parkman. As seen in \\"Shades of Gray\\", Hiro and Ando are directed to Los Angeles where they find that the Matt Parkman, Rebel was referring to, was only a baby also named Matt Parkman. In \\"Cold Snap\\", Hiro and Ando discover that this is actually the son of the Matt Parkman they know. They also discover the baby possesses the ability to touch things and make them \\"go\\". When armed men break into baby Matt's house, Hiro discovers that the baby also is able to restart his powers, at least in part. After the baby touched Hiro, he is able to once again manipulate time, though he is still unable to bend space and teleport. After freezing time, Hiro takes baby Matt and the frozen Ando, whom he puts in a wheelbarrow, and walks twelve miles to a bus station. After restarting time, Hiro remarks to Ando, \\"Time is once again on our side.\\" In \\"Turn and Face the Strange\\", after escaping, Hiro and Ando, with baby Matt in tow, are in the way to find Matt Sr., but Matt Jr. keeps inactivating any vehicle they are on due to the noise they make, until Ando comes with a funny face to entertain the baby, and Hiro convinces him to keep it so the \\"cube\\" can go. They finally manage to track down Matt Sr. who has gone to confront Danko. Hiro freezes time just as Danko fires his gun at Matt and drags Matt out of the apartment. Hiro then unites Matt with the son he didn't know he had, giving Matt a reason to live again. In \\"I Am Sylar\\", Hiro and Ando try to convince Matt to join them bringing down \\"Building 26\\", but he refuses because he has a son now to look for and he must retrieve Jr. to his mother in LA. Later, they arrive Reed Street Laboratory to set up a trap for HLS agents, using Ando as bait, although he refuses, as Hiro manages to not freeze him, telling him he is a hero too, but Hiro still keeps his plan going on, unfreezing the agents so they can take down Ando, and then freezing everybody again so he can take an agent's place as they carry Ando to the \\"Building 26\\". Once in motion, Hiro manages to awake Ando so he can be ready for action, but when he unfreezes time, an agent realizes Hiro is not one of them, and Ando shoots a big blast of red lightning, affecting everyone and saving Hiro. As plan B, they use the GPS signal of the agents to track the place, and once they are ready to fight, Hiro tries to freeze time, but instead he receives a strong headache and nosebleed as they realize he can't use his ability anymore. In \\"An Invisible Thread\\", Hiro recovers from his headache and nosebleed and insists on continuing with the plan despite the danger. He stops time and he and Ando infiltrate Building 26 to free the trapped prisoners. They find and free Danko and Noah and find the drugged evolved humans, but Hiro's ear starts bleeding and he clearly hides the fact that he is in pain. The two free them and replace them with all of the members of the Building 26 unit and Hiro then unfreezes time and he and Ando showed the freed prisoners the way out. Mohinder checks Hiro out and determines that Hiro's body is rejecting his powers and he can't risk freezing time anymore. Hiro freezes time again to save Noah Bennet from being tranquilized by Danko and tranquilizes Danko, but faints afterwards and is apparently taken to a hospital. Later an apparently fully recovered (Though still suffering from headaches) Hiro and Ando witness the burning of Sylar's (really James Martin) body and Hiro tells Ando it is time for them to return home to Tokyo. Redemption In \\"Orientation\\", Hiro still has headaches and effects of the illness he developed as a result of his restored powers and Ando insists he go see a doctor. Hiro reveals what he has; he's dying of a terminal illness, news that shocks Ando. The two have started a Dial A Hero business as they want to be real heroes. Hiro's sister, Kimiko is unhappy and insists they pay rent if they're going to continue to operate out of the Yamagato conference room. They get their first call from a little girl that wants them to save her cat Muffin Man, and as neither of their powers are useful in the situation (Hiro still only being able to stop time) Hiro has Ando climb up and save the cat. Ando falls but Hiro stops time and saves him, however, when he restarts time, as a side effect of his condition, Hiro is briefly frozen in time himself while the world continues on around him. Ando takes Hiro back to Yamagato and Hiro finally unfreezes and the two discuss a carnival they attended 14 years before; Hiro got his fortune told by a fortune teller, causing him to start on his path to being a hero and Ando accidentally spills a drink on Kimiko, causing her to hate him while he's in love with her. While in reflection about this, Hiro's time travel ability suddenly re-manifests and he teleports to the carnival 14 years in the past. In \\"Jump, Push, Fall\\", Hiro is at the carnival when his past-self asks him to take the picture he was reflecting over in the present. While debating with himself if he should or shouldn't stop his past-self from getting his fortune told, he runs into the Samuel Sullivan of his own time. Samuel shows him that he has powers too and tries to convince Hiro to make small changes to the past to fix small mistakes. He pushes Hiro in the way of the falling Slushy (which was Past Hiro's fault) and it spills all over him instead of Kimiko. Hiro suddenly teleports back to the present and finds a slight change; as a result of him getting hit with the Slushy instead of Kimiko, Kimiko never grew to hate Ando and the two fell in love at the carnival. As a result of this, Hiro decides his new mission is to change past mistakes even though he doesn't have full control over his time travel power yet. In \\"Acceptance\\", Kimiko reveals she and Ando have gotten engaged and as she and Hiro are the last remaining members of their family, she wants him to give her away at the wedding which he accepts. Ando, learning of this, reminds Hiro that Hiro is dying and may not be alive for the wedding which is over a year away and pushes him to tell Kimiko the truth about his illness. Hiro gets a call from a former Yamagato accountant named Tadashi on the Dial a Hero line and learns the man is about to jump off the roof and commit suicide. On the roof, Tadashi explains why he's about to kill himself and although Hiro offers to fix things, Tadashi commits suicide. Hiro time travels to the past and apparently fixes things, but Tadashi jumps again having made the same mistake at another time. After 47 tries, Hiro visits Tadashi on the roof one last time and simply talks to him this time. He realizes Tadashi hated his job and purposely got himself fired and tells him to use the opportunity to find a job he likes. Hiro tells Tadashi to cherish the life he has and admits to him his own terminal illness and says not to keep his unhappiness a secret from his family. Promising to always be Tadashi's friend, Hiro successfully talks him off the roof and prevents him from jumping. After leaving the roof, Hiro decides to take his own advice and tells Kimiko the truth about his illness. Kimiko starts crying and embraces him, when one of his headaches hits and he seemingly freezes in time for a moment. Hiro unfreezes and suddenly teleports away to Peter Petrelli's apartment, where he collapses (Hysterical Blindness). In \\"Tabula Rasa\\", once in the hospital, he reveals he is suffering from a brain tumor. While Peter tracks down healer Jeremy Greer in order to save his life, Hiro helps Emma Coolidge to come to terms with her own ability. Following this he is reminded of Charlie, and resolves to try and save her again. He later teleports three years back in time to the Burnt Toast Diner, seeing Charlie through the window. In \\"Once Upon a Time in Texas\\", Hiro teleports to the day of Charlie's death and resolves to save her. He first steals some clothes as he teleported to Midland in just his hospital gown. He encounters a young boy and tells him about his love for Charlie and the Brain Man (Sylar). The two encounter Sylar outside the diner and inside, Hiro witnesses Sylar interact with Charlie, detecting her blood clot and claiming he can fix it. Hiro then encounters Samuel (teleported from the future by his dying friend Arnold who possessed the same powers as Hiro) who warns him that unlike him fixing Ando and Kimiko's relationship, meddling with things at this point in time is dangerous due to how many people's fates converged here. Hiro, realizing Sylar is about to attack Charlie, freezes time and stops Sylar just in time. He removes Sylar on a dolly (as he still can't control his teleportation) and puts him in a bus compartment. Hiro then realizes that if he never goes back in time, he will never fall in love with Charlie so he sends his past self back in time telling him that his job is to \\"save the waitress\\" and that \\"the cheerleader\\" will be fine. His past self teleports away and is in the picture of Charlie's birthday party, keeping that part of history on track. Upon a reminder by Samuel, Hiro, introducing himself as Future Hiro, informs Past Ando of what Past Hiro has done and convinces him to stay as his past self never informed Ando of where he was disappearing off to this time. Hiro then visits Charlie who remembers him and he tries to get her to start on the world tour she always wanted to go on and she agrees, however, her blood clot starts to rupture into a fatal aneurysm and Hiro becomes desperate to save her again. He remembers Sylar said he could fix the clot and rushes to the bus station in Odessa where he encounters a free and angry Sylar. He evades him by repeatedly stopping time and moving around, but due to his condition this tires him out and gives him a headache, however, he succeeds in convincing Sylar by promising to reveal his personal future. At the diner, Sylar telekinetically removes Charlie's blood clot through her eye and saves her. Hiro keeps up his end of the deal telling Sylar he will become a powerful villain who many people will gather to kill and he will die alone and unmissed. Hiro then freezes time and returns Sylar to the Odessa Bus Station via motor scooter. At the diner, Charlie is angry with Hiro for saving her and not everyone who Sylar kills and runs off. Hiro later chats with Noah Bennet about love and is relieved when Charlie returns, and apologizes for her actions and admits she loves him. He follows her outside and finds her gone and Samuel waiting for him. Samuel tells him that Charlie is at his carnival in the present and if Hiro wants to see her again, he has to take control of his powers and transport them there. Hiro realizes Samuel is evil and grabs him in anger before managing to teleport them to Samuel's carnival in the present. This causes Samuel to remark that Hiro is finally regaining control over his powers. Hiro searches for Charlie and finds her nametag outside a dead Arnold's trailer and Samuel reveals he had Arnold trap her somewhere in time and the only way he'll tell Hiro where to look is if he does what Samuel wants. Hiro reluctantly agrees and Samuel tells him he made a mistake eight weeks before. In \\"Brother's Keeper\\", Samuel tells Hiro he needs to go back in time eight weeks and retrieve a film from Mohinder Suresh. Hiro offers to find him in the present as he's not sure about his ability to time travel, but Samuel tells him it has to be eight weeks before and that if he wants to see Charlie again he'll do it. Hiro, exercising control over his time travel and teleportation powers for the first time since got them back, teleports to Mohinder Suresh's hotel room eight weeks in the past, but his control is not perfect and he arrives ten minutes too late and finds Mohinder dead. He tries again and gets it right on the second try, arriving as Mohinder drops a lit match into a wastebasket with the film although doing so gives him a minor nosebleed. Hiro freezes time, exchanges the film for another one and puts a Kevlar vest on Mohinder to protect him from Samuel. After the fake film is burned and Samuel believes he killed Mohinder, Hiro reveals himself to Mohinder and tells him he's from the future and explains how he knew what was going to happen to Mohinder. Hiro tells Mohinder to disappear for eight weeks so Samuel will believe him dead and he can get Charlie back. Mohinder refuses so Hiro freezes time and teleports him away, displaying control of teleportation outside of time travel for the first time. He traps him in a mental institution in Florida so he'll be out of the way and then returns to the present where he gives Samuel the film and demands Charlie. Samuel says he will give her to him later before walking away. In \\"Thanksgiving\\", Hiro still demands Charlie back, but Samuel refuses to give up the only leverage he has over Hiro. Lydia offers to help and after reading Hiro and seeing his desires, she has him take her back in time eight weeks to witness Joseph's death. Hiro is reluctant, but does so, although he indicates Lydia was responsible for the time travel. The two witness Samuel murder Joseph and desperately try to teleport back before Samuel finds them. With Lydia's help, Hiro manages to return the two to the present, but a suspicious Samuel figures out the truth. He tries to claim Edgar killed Joseph, but Hiro refuses to back up Edgar's claim that Samuel did it due to Charlie. Samuel goes to kill Edgar, but Hiro freezes time and helps Edgar get away instead. Later, in retaliation and in order to keep Hiro in the Carnival, Samuel has Damien try to erase Hiro's mind, but instead it just addles his brains, causing him to start to think he is fictional characters and teleport away to save \\"Watson\\". In \\"Upon This Rock\\", Hiro teleports to Japan where he stops a purse snatcher, but uses various fictional references in regards to himself and everyone around him. Looking for his sidekick \\"Sancho Ponza\\", he is arrested and taken to Ando at Yamagato as the police found Ando's business card on him. Ando reveals Hiro has been missing for six weeks and has the cops let him go, although he is confused by Hiro's repeated calling him of \\"Sancho\\" and insisting that they must save \\"Watson\\" at \\"Arkham\\" in the land of the \\"swamp dragons.\\" Ando thinks that Hiro's brain tumor is causing this, but uses Hiro's comics to decipher that Hiro is referring to him as his sidekick and when he mentions Curt Connors that the land of the \\"swamp dragons\\" (alligators) is Florida and that \\"Arkham\\" refers to an asylum although Ando is unable to figure out what he means by \\"Watson.\\" Ando learns that in Florida there is an asylum on Arkham Road and realizes Hiro must want to go there. Hiro confirms this and claims Ando is the best sidekick he knows. ECT to fix Hiro's mind. In \\"Close To You\\", Hiro has Ando check him into the asylum in order to infiltrate it. As he's led down a hallway, Hiro points out \\"Watson's\\" room to Ando who checks and realizes who he's talking about. Ando later visits Hiro and when Hiro reveals that the drugs that are being used on Mohinder are preventing his use of super-strength, Ando switches Mohinder's pills with aspirin, but accidentally swallows Mohinder's pills and falls into a drug-induced stupor. Hiro hides Ando in a closet and later that night wakes up Mohinder who, now no longer under the influence of the hospital's drugs, easily breaks free of his straitjacket and cell. Hiro then leads the confused and angry Mohinder to Ando who they wheel to an outside door, but are confronted by orderlies who Hiro refers to as \\"stormtroopers\\". Ando snaps out of his daze and blasts the door open, allowing the three to escape into a swamp while the orderlies are distracted. Mohinder realizes that they can't outrun the orderlies and their dogs and wants Hiro to teleport them to safety, but in Hiro's addled state he is unable to. Mohinder suggests a reluctant Ando use his power like electro- shock therapy and try to shock Hiro back to normal and Ando tries. Ando's attempt works and Hiro is restored to normal. Hiro immediately teleports himself, Mohinder and Ando away to Noah Bennet's apartment, getting away seconds before the dogs and orderlies find the spot the three had been hiding in. Hiro teleporting into the apartment interrupts Noah and Lauren Gilmore kissing and Hiro asks for their help. In Pass/Fail, Hiro is starting to feel worse and collapses in Noah Bennet's apartment. Hiro is rushed to the hospital where he is now dying from his brain tumor. The doctors start to operate on him to attempt to remove the tumor and save him, while Hiro ends up in a hallucination where he is on trial for his acts of tampering with time during Redemption. Adam Monroe is the prosecutor, Kaito is the judge and Ando is the defense attorney. Young Ando, Kimiko and Sylar are brought in as witnesses for the prosecution and used against him and Hiro testifies for himself and is found guilty. While being led toward the light, he asks Kaito for a chance to redeem himself and is given it. Hiro sword-fights Adam and kills him with the real Ando's encouragement while in the real world he crashes on the operating table. Hiro's mother Ishi appears to him and in his mind heals him of his tumor, reviving him in the real world where the doctors successfully remove the tumor. Later, Hiro chats with Ando, now cured. In \\"Brave New World\\", while testing out his renewed powers, a nurse comes in and gives him a battered origami swan. Hiro realizes it's from Charlie and goes to her room to find her an old, dying, woman. Charlie explains that Arnold teleported her to Milwaukee on January 26, 1944 and she started a new life and a family there. Hiro initially wants to travel to that date and return her to her own time, but Charlie convinces him not to as she has lived a good life which will never exist if he interferes. With Charlie safe, Hiro finds himself purposeless until Ando reminds him of Samuel Sullivan and Hiro teleports the two to the Carnival in Central Park after saying a final goodbye to Charlie. There, Claire asks Hiro to teleport dozens of specials away from the Carnival to strip Samuel of his powers. Hiro agrees to try, telling everyone to hold hands, but is unsure he can do it until Ando offers to supercharge him. With Ando supercharging him, Hiro successfully teleports everyone away, stripping Samuel of his immense powers and allowing Peter to defeat him. Hiro and Ando later return to the Carnival and witness Claire jumping from the Ferris Wheel and exposing her powers to the world. Heroes Reborn In \\"Brave New World\\", Tommy owns a copy of 9th Wonders!, Issue #31, the cover of which features Ando and Hiro at Sam's Comics. In \\"Under the Mask\\", in the lobby of Yamagato Tower, Harris disarms Miko, and recognizes that her sword belongs to Hiro Nakamura. When Noah forces Norris to show him security footage of himself at the hospital on June 13, he sees that time keeps skipping back and forth in one room he was in. He assumes that the temporal anomaly was caused by Hiro. When Noah tells Quentin what he saw in the footage, Quentin comes to the same conclusion. In \\"The Lion's Den\\", Noah Bennet asks Erica Kravid about the true status of Hiro Nakamura. Erica claims that he died at the Odessa Peace Summit on June 13, 2014. Noah, however, does not believe her. In \\"Game Over\\", Noah eventually gets Harris to lead him to a facility where Hiro is trapped in a video game. Noah and Ren learn that Miko Otomo can only release Hiro by sacrificing herself. Hiro is eventually rescued by Miko using the Kensei sword as a key. Hiro emerges from the video game in time to freeze time around Noah and save his life as he's about to be shot. Hiro greets Noah who asks Hiro to take him back to June 13, 2014 to change history. Hiro is reluctant, but decides that Erica Kravid used him to bend time to her own purposes when she imprisoned him, so he agrees. Hiro teleports away with Noah, asking him not to step on any butterflies. At the Odessa Summit, Hiro and Noah appear and walk towards the building. In \\"June 13 - Part 1\\", Hiro's past self is seen as CEO of Yamagato Industries. Having not time traveled in years, Hiro refuses to aid Erica Kravid's effort to send supplies to the future and the man sent to convince him traps him in Evernow which allows Erica to channel Hiro's power for her own purposes. Hiro is reported dead in the bombing to the man's shock. After the future Hiro brings them back to the summit, Noah explains the bombing to him. After Noah learns from Angela Petrelli that Claire is in the hospital, Hiro sends Noah to save Claire while he stops the bomb. Hiro tells Noah that \\"this time you will save the cheerleader\\" while he stops the bomb, referring to his future self's \\"save the cheerleader, save the world\\" message. Hiro rescues Mohinder Suresh from Harris and takes on two Harris' who are armed with bomb vests while Mohinder chases another one. Armed with two swords, Hiro faces off with the clones who tell him he can't defeat them on his own. Stating that he can but he needs to know what will happen if he does, Hiro freezes time and teleports away, appearing several times just feet away from the one before. Finally, Hiro sadly states \\"too many butterflies\\" and teleports away, unfreezing time. Returning to Noah just after he says goodbye to a dead Claire, Hiro informs him that it is impossible to change the bombing as there are too many variables and any attempt to change the future will result in a worse one as he discovered when he tried. Hiro and Noah attempt to return to their time, but are stopped when Phoebe Frady unleashes a massive cloud of darkness that drains Hiro's powers. Shortly afterward, Harris bombs the summit and Hiro and Noah stare at the rising smoke cloud in the distance in horror. Returning to Angela and Claire's children, Hiro insists that they can't change Claire's death or the bombing as it is fate and even he can't change fate. Angela concurs with this and tells them about the future apocalypse she foresaw and that one or both of Claire's children hold the key to saving the world. Noah realizes that the safest place for them is in the past where they can grow up and gain their powers while Erica will be looking for toddlers in the future, not teenagers. Hiro reluctantly agrees to take the children, Nathan and Malina back to 1999 with Angela and tells Noah he will return shortly and not to change anything else. It is shown that Hiro left Nathan with the nurse who helped him feed the baby, Anne Clark and Nathan would grow up to be teleporter Tommy Clark. In \\"June 13 - Part 2\\", Hiro takes Angela, Nathan and Malina back to 1999, but they land in Odessa rather than Geneva as planned. When Hiro attempts to transport them to Geneva, he discovers his power is gone and Angela realizes that Nathan has power absorption abilities similar to Arthur and Peter. He took Claire's power, resulting in her death and has now taken Hiro's power. Angela realizes they need to keep the children apart and takes Malina with her, leaving Hiro to raise Nathan himself. In the present, Noah tries to track down Hiro with the help of Molly Walker so he can return Noah to his own time. Molly is able to locate Hiro's power, but not Hiro himself. Arriving at a house in Odessa, Noah finds an older Hiro to his shock. Hiro has married nurse Anne Clark from the hospital and raised Nathan as his own son. Hiro explains that Nathan has his powers now and can only keep one ability at a time. Hiro is angry that Noah tried to kill Erica Kravid and Harris shows up to attack. Nathan teleports Harris across the room, allowing Noah to kill him and Noah has Nathan take him to see Angela. After Noah's return, Hiro guides Nathan through returning Noah to the future and spots more Harris' arriving. Hiro orders Nathan to take Anne and Caspar to safety while he holds off Harris. He says goodbye to Anne and gives Nathan the 9th Wonders! comic that set Hiro on his path to his destiny, hoping it can help Nathan do the same one day. After Nathan teleports away, Hiro draws two swords and charges the three Harris' for a final stand. Nathan attempts to return to aid Hiro, forcing Caspar to erase his memory of all but Anne to protect him, leading to Nathan becoming Tommy Clark. In \\"Sundae, Bloody Sundae\\" Tommy is finally told the truth about everything including that he has Hiro's powers and Hiro was his step-father. Without his memories, Tommy shows that he thinks himself a simple teleporter and is unaware of his being able to time travel or freeze time. However, he is able to relearn how to use these parts of his ability after it is revealed to be Hiro's. In \\"Company Woman\\", Tommy takes Anne to the future and she reminds him that Hiro trained him all of his life to save the world even though Tommy doesn't remember it. Anne tells Tommy that Hiro was always amazed by Tommy's powers and had stated that Tommy could do much more with them than Hiro ever could. However, Anne doesn't know what Hiro meant by that. She also reminds Tommy that according to Hiro, what they're seeing is only one possible future which means he can still change it. When Tommy later considers going back in time to find Malina, Anne warns him against that as Hiro had always told her going into the past and changing history was \\"a dangerous game.\\" In \\"Project Reborn\\", Tommy sees several memories of his life with Hiro including Hiro introducing himself to baby Nathan and his goodbye to Tommy before apparently sacrificing himself to save Tommy. Tommy is left emotional at seeing himself with Hiro and after his escape from the Eternal Fortress, realizes he can split himself in two with Hiro's powers. Erica Kravid tells Tommy that not even Hiro could do that, but Tommy tells her Hiro trained him for his whole life in using his powers and he had \\"an eternity\\" in the Eternal Fortress to practice. Tommy later rescues Noah from being killed and shows him how seven years in the past, Angela Petrelli determined that the only way for Tommy and Malina to save the world was to have a human conduit for their powers. However, such an action would be fatal for the conduit. Tommy explains that he tried to stop the H.E.L.E. \\"a thousand times\\" but couldn't so instead of he followed some advice Hiro once gave him about time travel and changing time: to follow \\"the tiniest thread, the smallest butterfly\\" while trying to locate the key to changing events. In Tommy's case, that had led him to Noah who agreed to sacrifice himself to allow his grandchildren to save the world. While explaining this, Tommy paraphrases Future Hiro's message of \\"save the cheerleader, save the world\\" by telling Noah \\"save you, save the world.\\"  Alternate futures  * Another Hiro Nakamura, this one claiming to be from the future, first appears in \\"Collision\\". When he appears to Peter Petrelli in a subway, he freezes time in order to speak with Peter privately. He urges Peter to \\"save the cheerleader, save the world\\" and to \\"be the one we need,\\" but doesn't elaborate for fear of causing a rift in the space-time continuum. He also mentions that Peter looks different \\"without the scar.\\" The future Hiro appears to be much more fit, confident, and experienced than his present self. He sports a soul patch and ponytail, no longer wears glasses, wears a black overcoat, carries a katana on his back, and speaks fluent idiomatically-correct English. Future Hiro's fluent accent is, in fact, Masi Oka's real voice, deepened for dramatic effect. He is also much more serious, focused, and calm than the current-day Hiro, and his sense of humor appears to be diminished. The future Peter Petrelli speculates that it was Ando's death in the explosion that changed Hiro. He appears again in the episode \\".07%\\" when he meets with present Hiro and \\"Five Years Gone\\" which tells a side story about himself. Future Hiro also appears in the graphic novel Heroes #30 ‚Äì \\"String Theory\\" in which he acts as a nightwatcher, who watches over people with powers getting hunted down by normal, human police officers. In this issue, Hiro rescues a girl named Sparrow and the two seem to know each other. He also explains a bit what happened in the future after the bomb went off. The issue ends with the final scene of \\".07%\\". ** Before \\"Five Years Gone\\" takes place, in the graphic novel series \\"Walls\\" Parts 1 and 2, Hiro and Peter break other people with special abilities out of a prison, though Hiro and Peter aren't able to stop time, because one of the others block the ability, though Hiro does draw his sword. **In \\"Five Years Gone\\" the scene starts again with Hiro and Ando meeting Hiro's future self. He tells them how they aren't supposed to be there and asks why the future hasn't changed. Future Hiro learns that present-day Hiro has not had the chance to kill Sylar yet. He decides that he must get present Hiro back to the past so that he can stop Sylar, but before Future Hiro can do so, Matt Parkman, his Homeland Security squad, and the Haitian raid the loft. Future Hiro and Ando are able to escape, but present-day Hiro is captured. Future Hiro begins recruiting people so that he can free present day Hiro and goes off to Las Vegas to seek Peter's help. Ando and Future Hiro encounter Niki, who is in a relationship with Peter. Niki tells them nothing about Peter, but when prompted, tells them that she knows that Mr. Bennet is in Texas, helping those with abilities to establish new identities and hide from the government. Once there, Future Hiro asks Bennet for help, specifically requesting D.L. Hawkins, Candice Wilmer, and Molly Walker. While at first Bennet doesn't want to help, he agrees when he hears that they know Claire is alive. Future Hiro and Ando then begin talking about what happened to Ando in the future. Right when Hiro is about to tell Ando something important, he is shot with a Taser by Matt. Before they are about to be captured, Peter comes and by utilizing Hiro's power, is able to help them escape. With Peter's help, Future Hiro and Ando are able to enter the building where present-day Hiro is being held and make it to him. Right after they free present-day Hiro, future Hiro tells them he will take them back to their time since present-day Hiro still doesn't have full control of his powers, but before he can do it he is shot and killed by Matt Parkman. Before Future Hiro dies he gives Ando Isaac's incomplete comic book. * In an alternate future shown in \\"The Second Coming,\\" a future version of Hiro, while dressed the same as the aforementioned future version, has the same hairstyle as his present-day self, and still wears glasses. The older Hiro argues with Ando, who attacks Hiro with an energy manipulation ability in Tokyo, just before an unknown force destroys the city.  Powers and abilities  Hiro possessed the power to control the space-time continuum, giving him the power to manipulate the flow of time, travel through time, and teleport to any location at will, until Arthur Petrelli took it away when he traveled back to 1991. Specific examples of temporal manipulation include slowing time relative to himself and rewinding time specific to certain objects (a clock, a train, and a gun in various episodes). As demonstrated by his encounters with Daphne, a woman with the power of enhanced speed, Hiro does not stop time completely. Hiro has shown the ability to teleport both himself and others in physical contact with himself, both through space and time. Although stressful events and practice have helped Hiro to develop his abilities, Hiro initially has trouble with the more complicated teleportation and time travel abilities. For example, when he teleported to New York City, he inadvertently traveled five weeks into the future as well. Although he was able to travel back to the same time and place from which he left, he was only able to do so when his life was in danger from a nuclear explosion. Later, when he attempted to save Charlie's life by traveling to the day before her death, Hiro accidentally traveled six months into the past. He also inadvertently teleported to present day Japan from Texas just as he and Charlie were about to kiss and then could not teleport back, no matter how hard he tried. After the incident with Charlie, Hiro's powers began weakening, eventually becoming completely unusable though he is able to inadvertently reverse time for a bullet by one second, saving himself and Ando but unaware he did it. He seeks out Takezo Kensei's sword in the hope that it will focus his failing powers. After obtaining the sword, Hiro exhibits the ability to teleport other people along with himself, which he uses to rescue himself and Ando from an impending attack by casino guards in \\"Parasite\\", though this too resulted in an inadvertent trip five years into the future, after the explosion had occurred. The episode \\"Five Years Gone\\" marks his first successful use of teleportation and time travel. By \\"The Hard Part\\", Hiro has improved his skill in teleportation, as he uses it twice without traveling any discernible distance through time. His father attributes this to a matter of confidence rather than any effect caused by the sword. In addition to his power over time, Hiro is skilled with a katana, having been trained by his father. In \\"It's Coming\\" and \\"The Eclipse\\", Hiro is mentally reverted into a ten-year-old, but still possesses his powers. After Ando teaches him how to use them again, Hiro shows great control over them even in his young mental state, being able to stop time with ease (and using it to play tricks), teleport himself and others and time-travel 16 years into the past with Claire Bennett. In \\"Our Father\\", Hiro's abilities are stolen by Arthur Petrelli, rendering him a normal human. In the episode, \\"Cold Snap\\", Hiro regains some of his ability when the son of Matt Parkman, whom he dubs \\"Toddler Touch and Go,\\" touches him and turns his ability on. At the moment Hiro has regained the ability to stop and restart time, but is still unable to teleport or travel through time. In \\"I Am Sylar\\", Hiro manages to regain more of his abilities from Parkman's son, allowing him to make Ando unaffected by his time-freezing. However problems have now arisen, when Hiro and Ando prepare to infiltrate Building 26, Hiro's powers falter and he instead receives a blistering headache and a nosebleed. After the two rescue all of the evolved humans, Mohinder states that for some reason Hiro's body is now rejecting his powers and he can't risk freezing time again. Hiro does it one more time to save Noah Bennet from Danko, but it proves to be too much of a strain on him and causes him to pass out. Hiro appears to regain the full extent of his abilities in the fourth-season episode \\"Orientation\\". After focusing on a photograph of himself, Ando, and his sister Kimiko taken at the Sullivan Bros. Carnival 14 years ago, he inadvertently travels there. By doing so, he used both his time-traveling and teleportation abilities. He seems to have little control over his power. He seems to travel through time when he's thinking of something from the past. As of Hysterical Blindness, Hiro has the ability to teleport back. However, like his ability to time travel, his first teleportation seemed accidental and instinctual. It took him from Yamagato to Peter Petrelli's apartment. He then collapsed from presumably the strain the teleport put on him in his condition. His time-stopping ability, if he uses it too much, exhausts Hiro and causes him pain. As of \\"Tabula Rasa\\"\\", Hiro is beginning to have more control over his power. An unfortunate side effect of this ability is the strain it puts on the body can cause inoperable tumors. As of \\"Once Upon a Time in Texas\\" and \\"Brother's Keeper\\", Hiro is regaining control over the other aspects of his ability, but he lacks perfect control. When Samuel provoked him, Hiro managed to teleport them both to Samuel's carnival, but later he was unsure if he could time travel eight weeks. Hiro managed to perform this task, but it took him two tries to get it right as he said the first time took him ten minutes too late. The time travel caused him to have a minor nosebleed, but besides that he seemed to suffer no ill effects. He later displays just teleportation, teleporting Mohinder to Florida where he checks him into a mental hospital under a fake name in order to keep him out of sight for eight weeks in order to preserve the timeline. In \\"Thanksgiving\\", Lydia has him take her back eight weeks into the past to see Joseph Sullivan's death. He teleports them easily, but he indicates Lydia was responsible for it not him, but this is unclear. In the past he has trouble teleporting them back due to his lack of full control and probably the stress of the situation. However, with Lydia's help, he manages to bring them both back to the present. In \\"Close to You\\", Hiro lacks the ability to properly use his powers due to his mind being messed up, but once Ando restores his mind, Hiro is instantly able to teleport at will with Mohinder Suresh and Ando, taking them both to Noah Bennet's apartment. Hiro shows no trouble teleporting at will this time and takes more than one person with him, something he hasn't done since before he lost his powers. In \\"Brave New World,\\" Hiro tests his powers out after his brain tumor is removed and learns that removing the brain tumor has restored full control over his powers. Hiro is easily able to teleport himself and Ando to Central Park where the Carnival is with no issues. There, Hiro is asked to teleport over a dozen people away from the Carnival. Hiro has everyone hold hands and manages to succeed in teleporting everyone thanks to Ando supercharging his powers which give him the boost to his powers he needs to teleport such a large group of people. In \\"Heroes Reborn\\", Hiro's powers have evolved as has his understanding of them. Hiro repeatedly states that he can't change fated events and attempts to do so could result in worse futures. When Hiro is trapped in Evernow, Erica Kravid is able to harness Hiro's powers to send supplies to the future when even Hiro is not there to personally use the power. Before being trapped in the game, Hiro states that he hasn't time traveled in years. After being rescued from Evernow, Hiro is able to freeze time around Noah Bennet without even being fully out of the game. He is also able to keep Noah out of the freeze without touching him as he previously needed. After traveling back to the Odessa Peace Summit, Hiro is apparently able to change the future and then reverse the changes as he indicates that he saw what would come of his attempts to change things. In \\"Project Reborn\\", Erica Kravid stated that Hiro was unable to split himself in two though Tommy Clark displayed this ability while using Hiro's powers. In the same episode, Tommy revealed some advice Hiro gave him about changing time: that the best way to do it is to search for \\"the tiniest thread, the smallest butterfly\\" and doing so will lead to the key to changing events, something Hiro presumably learned on his own time travels.  Time alterations  Hiro's trips have given Hiro his own unique time line, which is reflected in some of Isaac Mendez's paintings of Hiro. Along with the existence of an alternate future version of himself, Hiro has come across or induced a few time paradoxes or alterations in the series. * In \\"One Giant Leap\\", Hiro travels with Ando to the United States even though Ando was still in Japan when he had previously traveled to the future New York City. When directly questioned about this by Ando, Hiro says they are changing the future. * Between the episodes \\"Seven Minutes to Midnight\\" and \\"Six Months Ago\\", Hiro traveled six months into the past in Texas. ** There, he changed history again by forming a close relationship with Charlie in the past. This change was most noted by a picture which had originally shown only Charlie at her birthday party now showing both her and Hiro. ** At one point, Hiro accidentally gave himself a phone call from Texas to Japan, while trying to contact Ando, though he immediately hangs up after he realizes it was the Hiro in Japan who had answered, afraid of coming into contact with his past self. ** In \\"Seven Minutes to Midnight\\", Charlie said that someone had given her a Japanese phrase book on her birthday. In \\"Six Months Ago\\", it is Hiro who gives her the phrase book. Ironically, in general, the future shown in \\"Don't Look Back\\" seems to be even more certain, as changes that have been or intended to have been made futile: * In \\"Six Months Ago\\", Hiro accidentally jumps back in time six months to prevent Charlie from dying, only to find out that she has a blood clot in her brain and will die anyway. * In \\"Unexpected\\", Isaac received a gun from Mr. Bennet ‚Äì the same gun Hiro found in Isaac's apartment when he traveled forward five weeks. * As of \\".07%\\" Sylar has killed Isaac in a similar manner to his original death. * In \\"String Theory\\", it is revealed that Future Hiro tells Peter to \\"Save the Cheerleader\\" so that the failed attempt to stop Sylar from exploding might prove successful. However, the future has proven itself to not be entirely certain, as the characters were able to stop the explosion from destroying New York City in \\"How to Stop an Exploding Man\\". Starting at the end of Season 1 and through much of Season 2, Hiro was in 1671 Feudal Japan. There he becomes personally entwined in the history and events surrounding the warrior, Takezo Kensei. Recognizing the man is not as history portrays him, Hiro works to help Takezo fulfill his \\"destiny\\". This results in Hiro personally influencing many major events. * In \\"Lizards\\", Hiro impersonates Takezo and uses his powers to disarm 11 bandits (\\"The Battle of Twelve Swords\\") and gains the gratitude and admiration of Yaeko, the swordsmith's daughter. * In \\"Kindred\\", Hiro forces Takezo to face 90 angry r≈çnin in order to retrieve the 'Fire Scroll', fulfilling another part of Takezo's \\"legend\\". * In \\"The Line\\", Hiro helps Takezo rescue Yaeko's father and discovers how Takezo will \\"save\\" Japan, destroying the illegal firearms that White Beard's army are planning to use to overthrow the Emperor. However, Hiro gives into his own desire for Yaeko, causing Takezo to side with White Beard. Hiro destroys the guns by himself. Yaeko later asserts that Hiro is the person the \\"Takezo Kensei\\" legends are about and vows to spread the legends under that name. To fulfill the final part of the legend, cutting out his own heart, he leaves Yaeko behind and returns to the present. * In Our Father and Dual, Hiro travels back in time with Claire Bennet sixteen years in an attempt to change the past. There the two successfully change some things: Claire prevents her father from answering a call that would have led to her becoming the catalyst and Hiro, after his mother heals his mind, has her transfer the catalyst to him to protect it. Unfortunately, Arthur Petrelli still ends up with the catalyst as he travels back in time too and steals it and Hiro's powers from Hiro before sending Claire back to the present, trapping Hiro in the past. Hiro tries to destroy the formula in the past, but only manages to rip it in half (like it originally was in the present) before Daphne and Ando rescue him before he does so and before Kaito kills him. In Redemption, Hiro has regained the ability to time travel and has decided to use it to right mistakes. This results in apparently minor changes to the timeline: * In \\"Jump, Push, Fall\\", Hiro, after regaining his ability to time travel and accidentally 14 years, stops Ando from spilling a Slushy on his sister Kimiko. Returning to the present, Hiro discovers that instead of Kimiko hating Ando since that night, they've been madly in love and start to have wedding plans in Acceptance. * In \\"Acceptance\\", after a co-worker commits suicide, Hiro goes back multiple times to change him getting fired, but it just happens a different way each time. Hiro finally changes things by sitting down and talking to the man before he kills himself and convincing him that it's not worth it. * In \\"Once Upon a Time in Texas\\", Hiro travels back three years in order to save Charlie from death at Sylar's hands. He makes a deal with Sylar to tell him about his future in exchange for Sylar's help in healing Charlie's aneurysm. Hiro was ready to begin a new life with Charlie before Samuel uses one of his family member's powers to trap Charlie somewhere in time, which he uses in order to manipulate Hiro into fixing a few of Samuel's 'indiscretions'. The information that Hiro provides to Sylar may alter the timeline further in future episodes, although there was no sign of an alteration upon Hiro's return to the present at the end of the episode. In order to keep history in line as much as possible as well, Hiro sends his own self back in time six months in order for him to fall in love with Charlie and tell Past Ando to stay, explaining what Past Hiro is doing. The only change that seems to be displayed is that when Sylar and Matt talk at the diner, he says he only tried to kill a waitress there. Sylar is also now worried about dying alone due to what Hiro has told him and didn't kill Samuel for his power and took Lydia's without killing later. Sylar also ends up repenting and turning good ultimately as a result. Charlie is kidnapped by Samuel and Arnold and sent to Milwaukee on January 26, 1944 where she ends up living a long life and meets up with Hiro again as an old woman in the present. Hiro offers to head to that date and place and return her to her own time, but she chooses not to as she lived a good life and has a family that would never exist if he did that. * In \\"Brother's Keeper\\", Hiro manages to time travel back eight weeks to retrieve a film from Mohinder Suresh for Samuel in order to get Charlie back. His attempt works on the second try (he replaces the film with a fake so Mohinder believes he burned the real one), with the first try (ten minutes too late) showing him Mohinder's fate. Hiro uses the opportunity to change that as well, putting a Kevlar vest on Mohinder, protecting him from Samuel's attack and making it appear that he died when he really didn't. He then requests Mohinder disappear for eight weeks to keep the timeline on track as much as possible and allow Hiro to get Charlie back, but Mohinder refuses wanting to stop Samuel so Hiro teleports him to Florida where he checks him into a mental hospital under a fake name so he's out of the way. In the present, Samuel displays no knowledge of Mohinder's survival. In the present, Hiro and Ando rescue Mohinder from the hospital after Hiro, even in a severely addled state, remembers Mohinder is there. * In \\"Thanksgiving, Hiro and Lydia teleport eight weeks into the past in order to witness Joseph's death. They learn that Samuel killed him, but just observe and don't interfere in the event. However, Lydia makes noise and while Hiro and Lydia manage to teleport away, in the present it makes Samuel suspicious of Lydia leading to the expulsion of Edgar from the Carnival and Edgar nearly being killed before Hiro saves him. In Heroes Reborn Hiro had stopped using his time travel powers following the end of Redemption but resumes use of them after being rescued from Evernow: * In \\"Game Over\\" and \\"June 13 - Part 1\\", Hiro takes Noah Bennet back in time a year to the Odessa Peace Summit on June 13, 2014 in an attempt to stop the bombing of the Summit and save Claire Bennet's life. Though Hiro finds the bomber, he experiments with what will happen if he tries to stop the bombing. It is indicated that he experienced multiple possible futures trying this as he tells Noah that if he changes this event, the futures that will result will be even worse. Hiro is unable to safely change the bombing and tells Noah it is impossible to do as it is fate and he can't change fate. He is also unable to save Claire's life for the same reason. Instead, at Noah's request, Hiro takes Claire's children Nathan and Malina back to 1999 to protect them so they will grow up and be ready for their destiny of saving the world while also protecting them from Erica Kravid. This is shown to not be a change to the timeline but rather something that was apparently destined to happen as Noah had his memory of the day erased to protect the children from Erica Kravid and Nathan (now known as Tommy Clark) and Malina are seen before Hiro travels back to the Summit and then 1999. * In \\"Sundae, Bloody Sundae\\", it is revealed that Hiro was partially responsible for minor changes to the timeline during his trip with Noah: Noah altered a few things that resulted in the Haitian and Quentin still being alive, but also turned Quentin from good to evil. Reception UGO Networks listed Hiro as one of their best heroes of all time. The character has had a mixed reception. Malian-French pop singer Aya Nakamura adapted her stage name from the character.

The film is a remake of director Fei Mu's 1948 film and its original screenwriter is Li Tianji (Chinese: ÊùéÂ§©Êøü; pinyin: L«ê TiƒÅnj√¨), Spring in a Small Town. Though the two movies are referred to by different English titles, they share the same title in Chinese. Springtime in a Small Town marks the return of Tian Zhuangzhuang to the director's chair, following a nearly nine-year absence since his last film, The Blue Kite (1993). It was funded by several production companies from China (Beijing Film Studio, Beijing Rosart Film), France (Orly Films, Paradis Films), and the Netherlands (Fortissimo Films). Unlike Kite, which deployed a large cast, spanned decades, and carried a political message, Springtime is a small intimate chamber-piece. Plot The film follows Fei Mu's original fairly closely. Zhang Zhichen (Xin Baiqing), a city doctor, comes to visit his old friend from school Dai Liyan (Wu Jun) shortly after the war against the Japanese has ended. Dai is sickly although Zhang suspects it to be mainly a case of hypochondria. While visiting, he meets Liyan's wife, Yuwen (Hu Jingfan) and Liyan's teenage sister Dai Xiu (Lu Sisi). Zhang and Yuwen has had a passionate love affair ten years earlier before she had been engaged. Due to her husband's sickness however, the couple has ceased to have any real physical contact. With Zhang back, he and Yuwen find themselves attracted to one another again. As emotions run high, Dai Xiu's birthday comes up. As the drinks begin to flow, Zhang and Yuwen's mutual attraction become apparent to everyone, especially to Liyan. Too sickly in his mind to care for his wife any longer, he begs Zhang to stay. Liyan then promptly attempts suicide by overdose but is saved by his friend. Zhang then decides that it is best that he departs. While faithful to the plot of the original, Tian's remake dropped the original's use of a voice-over narration by Yuwen. Cast Unlike Tian's ensemble direction in The Blue Kite, the cast here is deliberately limited to only five actors, all of whom were unknowns at the time of Springtime's release. *Hu Jingfan as Yuwen, the wife *Wu Jun as Dai Liyan, her husband *Xin Baiqing as Zhang Zhichen, Dai Liyan's childhood friend and Yuwen's former lover *Ye Xiaokeng as Lao Huang, Dai Liyan and Yuwen's loyal servant *Lu Sisi as Dai Xiu, Dai Liyan's young sister Reception The film received positive reviews from film critics.

The Metacritic aggregator recorded the film received an average score of 86/100, meaning \\"universal acclaim.\\" Variety praised the film as a \\"visually rich\\" and \\"exquisitely made love story.\\" The Sight and Sound states: \\"this is a sensual, haunting film, atmospheric and moving, full of melancholy and a subtle eroticism.\\" J. Hoberman of The Village Voice describes the film as \\"exquisitely crafted\\" and \\"a movie of indefinable moods and subtle emotional coloration.\\" Hoberman further writes: \\"Tian's first feature in the decade...is also his quietest, remaking a 1948 Chinese classic to marvelous effect.\\" Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader writes \\"This erotically charged drama may not be quite as great as the original, but it's an amazing and beautiful work just the same.\\" Awards and nominations *Venice Film Festival, 2002 **San Marcos Prize *Troms√∏ International Film Festival, 2003 **Don Quixote Award DVD Springtime in a Small Town was released in the United States on DVD on 23 November 2004 and is distributed by Palm Pictures.

He served in the post from 2003 to 2018, following his grandfather (and NASCAR co-founder) Bill France Sr. and father Bill Jr., in the executive position. In 2019, France founded Silver Falcon Capital, Inc. and became CEO of the private investing firm. Early life France was exposed to the business of stock car racing from a young age. His first job in racing was as a janitor at the Talladega Superspeedway. France studied at the University of Central Florida but joined NASCAR before earning a degree. Early career France managed several short tracks, including Tucson Raceway Park in Arizona in the earlier years of his career. In the 1990s, he ran NASCAR's Los Angeles office and helped create associations between NASCAR and the entertainment industry. As a result, films began advertising at NASCAR events, and NASCAR drivers began to feature in various forms of media.Clarke, 252-253. In 1995, Brian France helped to create the Craftsman Truck Series. In 2000, he became NASCAR's executive vice president. Career France became NASCAR's CEO and Chairman of the Board in 2003, after his father retired from the position. One of France's first actions as CEO was to create a new safety rule that barred drivers from racing back to the start/finish line when under caution. After assuming control of NASCAR, France negotiated a title sponsorship from Sprint Nextel and introduced the Chase for the Sprint Cup over the transition period, receiving a $4.5 billion television contract for the initial ten race seasons, in addition to a later multibillion-dollar deal with NBC. France also made an effort to expand the audience base of NASCAR to minorities, and allowed Toyota vehicles to begin competing on the NASCAR circuit.Clarke, 230-233. During France's tenure as CEO, NASCAR tv ratings peaked in the mid-2000s, but by 2014, they had dropped, accompanied by a 15% decrease in track attendance. The Sporting News named France one of the five most powerful sports executives in 2005, and, in 2006, Time magazine named him one of the \\"100 Most Influential of the Century.\\" During the 2016 presidential campaign, NASCAR pulled its Xfinity Series and Camping World Truck Series award ceremonies from a Trump resort near Miami. Later, on February 29, 2016, France and several NASCAR drivers appeared at a rally to endorse Donald Trump's candidacy. In August 2018, France took an \\"indefinite leave of absence\\" from his role as CEO and chairman of NASCAR. On August 5, France was pulled over in Sag Harbor, NY for driving through a stop sign and subsequently arrested for DUI and possession of Oxycodone. France later pleaded guilty to one count misdemeanor DUI on June 7, 2019. His leave of absence officially ended in February 2019 when interim head of NASCAR, Jim France, permanently took over as CEO and chairman.  Silver Falcon Capital  In 2019, France founded and became CEO of Silver Falcon Capital, Inc., a private investment firm based in Charlotte, North Carolina. Other ventures France founded Brand Sense Partners, a Los Angeles-based licensing company.

It continues the story of the mythological hero Theseus after his return from Crete. Plot introduction The story is a retelling of the life of mythological hero Theseus after his return from the Minoan palace of Knossos. The novel follows his later quests, his friendship with Pirithoos, and his liaison with Hippolyta and marriage to Phaedra. Plot summary Theseus returns to Athens along with the other Athenian bull-leapers. His father, Aegeus, has committed suicide, which leaves the kingdom to the young Theseus. He soon meets Pirithoos, the rebellious pirate king of the Lapiths, and the two go on several adventures. Pirithoos talks Theseus out of going to Crete to meet his bride-to-be, Phaedra, and instead the two journey to Euxine, home of the Amazons. There, Theseus falls in love with Hippolyta the leader of the Amazons, and after defeating her in single combat, takes her home to Athens with him. She is beautiful, athletic, and honorable, sharing the same physical fearlessness and pride in 'kingship' that Theseus has. Hippolyta becomes closer and more important to Theseus than has any other woman or person in his life. Hippolyta bears Theseus a son, Hippolytus, and continues to fight and hunt alongside him. The people of Athens generally fail to understand the equal and reciprocal relationship that Theseus has with Hippolyta because they see her as a foreign barbarian who does not adopt the traditional female role and because they fear the return of Goddess worship. Theseus, doing what is strategically best for his kingdom, eventually and reluctantly decides to marry the Cretan princess Phaedra. Hippolyta advises him to make this marriage, regarding him as her king as well as her partner and lover. Phaedra bears him a son, Akamas, but continues living in Crete. When the Scythians (allied with the Amazons) attack Athens with massive and almost overwhelming forces, Hippolyta helps defend the Acropolis. At the climax of the battle, Theseus hears the call of the god to give his life for his people and he goes willingly to the sacrifice, fighting at the front of his army without his shield with the thought that the tide will be turned and his people saved. However, at the last moment, Hippolyta unexpectedly leaps in front of Theseus, taking the arrow meant for him. She dies in his arms. Theseus, enraged, goes on to win the battle for his people but his life is spared. However, in addition to losing the greatest love of his life, he has also lost some of the divine inspiration that previously guided him to be the best king that he could be, feeling that he was called to make the sacrifice but that Hippolyta took that from him. \\"The King had been called and the King had died\\". He reflects on the irony of the fact that Hippolyta, notwithstanding her understanding of the king's duty to sacrifice himself for his people, at the end chose to save him due to her love for him as a man rather than her duty to him as king. Years pass. Hippolytos, the son of Theseus and Hippolyta, has grown into a tall, handsome young man with a kingly presence, quiet and serious disposition, and an interest in medicine. Theseus is disappointed to learn, however, that Hippolytus has taken a vow of chastity as part of his devotion to the god of medicine and that he is not interested in being the heir of Theseus to the throne of Athens. Theseus therefore reluctantly decides that his less kingly son by Phaedra, Akamas, should come to Athens to begin to learn how to be king. Theseus is not eager to include Phaedra, who is living in Crete, but decides that he might dishonor her if he did not invite her to Athens. She meets Hippolytus and develops a strong passion for him unknown to Theseus. Phaedra's ultimate goal is later revealed to be a plan to convince Hippolytus to kill Theseus, marry her, and restore the Goddess worship, though it is unclear when and how much of this is shared with Hippolytus. Hippolytus is horrified by Phaedra's overtures and attempts to avoid her at all costs, but, since she confided in him as a doctor, he feels that he cannot betray her thoughts to his father. Hippolytus makes repeated efforts to escape her presence but Phaedra persuades Theseus on several occasions that she needs to see Hippolytus for medical reasons. Theseus remains completely oblivious to what is going on. After Hippolytus rejects her yet again, Phaedra falsely accuses Hippolytus of rape. Bound by his oath, Hippolytus feels he cannot defend himself. Theseus, taken by surprise by these revelations and suffering from the onset of his earthquake warning sickness, exiles his son and curses him, telling him that he will soon feel Poseidon's wrath. Hippolytus flees. Phaedra's son, Akamas, despite his choking sickness, uses all of his strength to get to Theseus and tell him the truth. Theseus realizes his error and races his chariot after Hippolytus in an effort to reach him, further recognizing that his son is the only person he did not warn with respect to the earthquake. However, he is too late: a tsunami, caused by the earthquake, smashes Hippolytus and his chariot; near his son is a bull caught in the tsunami, the \\"bull from the sea\\" that Theseus had long ago been warned not to loose. Theseus reaches his son shortly before he dies and shares a few last words. Theseus then returns to confront his wife regarding her lies; he kills her in revenge for the death of his son. Realizing that he should have made her publicly admit her guilt and clear his son's name, he then writes a suicide note in her handwriting in which she confesses to her crime. In the remainder of the book an ageing Theseus confronts his mortality and loss. The deaths of Hippolyta and his son have diminished his sense of purpose. On another expedition, he suffers a stroke. His men are loyal to him and he is well cared for as he attempts to recover on an unknown island. To avoid giving an opportunity to his enemies, Theseus has his men bring a tale to Athens that he has gone down into the earth to be purified and that he will eventually return to destroy the enemies of Athens. This story later becomes the source of the legend that Theseus visited the underworld. During his long, slow, and partial recovery, Theseus ruminates on his past actions, wondering how life might have been different if he had not gone roving and met Hippolyta or if his son had not been accused while Theseus was suffering from the earthquake sickness. An earthquake occurs which Theseus did not anticipate and by that sign he believes that the god Poseidon has truly forsaken him as a punishment for cursing his son instead of warning him. However, he seems to conclude that fate and character are intertwined and that one cannot avoid one's destiny. Eventually, he heals enough to return to Athens where he learns that those in power during his absence have ruined many of his achievements, allowing his kingdom to be broken into pieces and into disarray. Despairing, he leaves Athens believing that his legacy has been ruined. While visiting the king of Skyros, Lykomedes, he sees the young Achilles, who has been hidden on the island to avoid his mother's prophecy that he would die in battle. Theseus considers trying to warn Achilles of his fate, but decides that Achilles would not listen to him and that a man cannot outrun his fate. That night Theseus dreams that he will fight alongside his people against the Persians at the future battle of Marathon, saving them again and knowing that his name will continue to be revered and honored by his people. Having received some contentment from this vision and hearing yet again the \\"sea surge\\" sound again in his ears that tells him that the god has returned to him, he decides to jump from the cliff into the sea and so end his life, fulfilling the titular motif of sacrifice in The King Must Die.

Life and career   Education and civil service career  Meechai has completed a bachelor's degree in law from Thammasat University and a master's degree in comparative law from Southern Methodist University, Texas. He participated in the Texas Legislative Internship Program. After his return to Thailand, he became a civil servant at the Office of the Council of State, rising to become head of the law drafting division. He was appointed legal advisor of prime minister Sanya Dharmasakti in 1973 and permanently assigned to the Office of the Prime Minister. During the military rule he was appointed a member of the Nationale Legislative Assembly in 1977 and in the same year deputy secretary-general of the prime minister.  Cabinet minister and acting prime minister  In March 1980, he was appointed minister to the Office of the Prime Minister in the cabinet of General Prem Tinsulanonda. He held that position during all of Prem's eight-year rule and even after the change of government under Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan until 1990. Concurrently, he served as Senator from 1983 to 1989. In April 1991 he was appointed Deputy Prime Minister, serving under Anand Panyarachun and then under his successor General Suchinda Kraprayoon. Meechai also was president of the 1991 Constitution drafting committee. After Suchinda's resignation under public pressure in the course of the events of Black May on 24 May 1992, Meechai acted as caretaker prime minister until a new head of government (Anand Panyarachun for a second term) was appointed on 10 June.  Senate speaker  Afterwards Meechai served as Senator again and was the Speaker of the Senate from 1992 to 2000. In this position he presided over a constitutional tribunal which ruled as legal an executive decree of the Suchinda administration (reportedly drafted by Meechai himself) that amnestied those responsible for the shooting of protesters. Meechai was critical of the 1997 draft constitution that had been elaborated in a long process under intensive participation of the civil society. He deemed some of the provisions too progressive, e.g. the article that declared all discrimination on grounds of social origin illegal. This was in Meechai's view incompatible with Thai culture that held it normal to crawl on knees in front of the king and unthinkable to confront him upright and akimbo. However, he finally supported the passage of the constitution in order to avoid political chaos giving the Asian financial and economic crisis and the hope that many had set on this draft.  NLA president, junta member and constitution drafter  Meechai served as President of the military-appointed National Legislative Assembly of Thailand (NLA) after the coup d'√©tat in 2006.Â∏åÊúõ‰∏çÊñ≠ÁúãÂà∞Ê±ïÂ§¥Êñ∞ÂèòÂåñÊñ∞ÂèëÂ±ï; His appointment was seen as a sign for a move towards a more conservative, law-and-order constitution.Connors: Democracy and National Identity in Thailand. 2007, S. 271. He retrospectively judged the 1997 constitution as unsuitable for Thailand, comparing it to a Rolls Royce with which one cannot plough a paddy field. He claimed that the Thai monarchy was endangered by three different groups: one group was questioning the necessity of monarchy through articles and research; one was anonymously attacking members of the royal family by criticising their behaviour and posting unsuitable images on websites hosted abroad; the third would abuse the monarchy for self-interest and political causes. Therefore, the rigorous l√®se-majest√© law had to stay in place and be strictly enforced. Meechai was also an advocate of appointed, instead of democratically elected, Prime Minister and National Assembly. As of 2011, Meechai was the chairman of Thailand's Law Reform Commission at the Council of State. After another coup d'√©tat in 2014, Meechai‚Äîas one of two civilians‚Äîwas appointed as a member of the junta which calls itself the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO). After a first military-appointed committee's draft constitution failed, Meechai was appointed chairman of another Constitution drafting committee by the NCPO on 5 October 2015.  Family and social status  Meechai was married to Khunying Amphorn Ruchuphan (n√©e Seneewongse na Ayutthaya). They had two daughters. The academic David Streckfuss names Meechai as an example of \\"Those in the Shade of Charisma\\", referring to a group of (appointed) politicians, important business and upper-class figures who are in favour with the palace.

The school was instituted in 1788, with the aim of maintaining the daughters of indigent Freemasons, unable through death, illness, or incapacitation to support their families. Since 1978, the school opened to the daughters of non-freemasons, and the name \\"Masonic\\" is a now just reference to its past. It began in 1789 with fifteen pupils and a Matron in Somers Town, St Pancras, Middlesex. During its history, the school has moved between premises three times, twice within London and finally in 1934 to Rickmansworth in Hertfordshire, where it still is today. The school occupies a 316-acre site in Rickmansworth Park. It is a day school for girls 4-18, a boarding school for girls 7-18 and since 2009 also a nursery opened in 2009 for boys and girls aged 2‚Äì4. In the beginning In 1788, Bartholomew Ruspini and nine fellow Freemasons met to discuss plans for establishing a charitable institution for the daughters of Masons who had fallen on hard times or whose death had meant hardship for their families. On 14 May 1788, a committee met at the Freemasons' Tavern in Great Queen Street to thrash out the details of the proposed institution. An advertisement for the position of Matron was put in the papers, and the committee set about finding suitable premises from which their charity could operate. The house at Somers Place East in Somers Town was a suggestion from Dr de Valangin, and was taken in October at a rent of ¬£35 per annum to house 15 children. The property has since disappeared but was between the present day Euston and St Pancras stations, near where the British Library is today. The original advertisement for the Matron read as follows: > ROYAL CUMBERLAND FREE MASON SCHOOL Little Chelsea Wanted a Matron to reside > in the House and instruct the Children in Reading, Writing, Housewifery, and > every necessary use of the Needle. She must be of the Established Religion > of the Church of England. A middle Aged, Well Educated Single Woman will be > preferred. Proposals in writing to be sent to the Secretary, 121, Pall Mall. Twenty replies were received, of which five were shortlisted. The decision was arrived at by means of ballot, and Mrs Ann Le Clerc was duly elected. She is referred to in the minutes of the meeting as a governess, and her address is given as 11 Wells Street, Marylebone. The term \\"Mrs\\" was used for single and married women alike, so it is unknown as to whether she was married or not. On 5 January 1789, the children met at Ruspini's house and walked in procession to the house. The ceremonial procession was reported in the Morning Post (later to become absorbed by the Daily Telegraph) and the Daily Advertiser on Saturday 10 January. The names of the children were listed with their birth and baptismal records. * Harriet Ann Vinet--17/04/1782 * Sarah Jane Sitgraves --23/01/1780 * Ann Kane--27/11/1780 * Margaret Burgess--08/08/1781 * Catherine Charlotte Baes--12/07/1783 * Sophia Riches--14/04/1780 * Mary Ann Ruscoe-- 16/07/1780 * Mary Ann Fiske--16/10/1782 * Frances Sansum--25/12/1780 * Sheila Proctor--20/01/1779 * Mary Ann Wolveridge--05/11/1779 * Charlotte Richardson-- 01/04/1781 * Sophia Kewney--29/01/1780 * Ann Martin--17/07/1781 * Elizabeth Lowe--21/08/1782 Of the fifteen, Charlotte Richardson was removed from the school by her parents within a couple of months. She was replaced by Charlotte Hatton. Also, Mary Bagley had petitioned for a place at the school but had been rejected, having been found to be too old. The governors, however, decided to keep her on as an assistant servant, getting maintenance, clothing, and her education in return. Although called a school, the institution was not what we might call a school until the mid-nineteenth century. In its early stages, it was more of an orphanage, although many of the girls had at least one parent living. At the end of their school life, girls were either returned to their family or supporters (known as Friends) or apprenticed and supported until they could establish themselves. The children could be from any part of the United Kingdom and had to be between the ages of six and nine. They had to be the daughters of freemasons and were required to be in good health, having already had smallpox or cowpox and \\"be free from infirmity of deformity.\\" It is known, however, that Frances Sansum from the first fifteen had only one leg. Location St George's Fields Although Ruspini and his fellow freemasons had intended the school to be a permanent establishment, even they had no idea how successful it would be. The house originally intended for 15 girls, a matron and a maid soon became too small with the addition of 5 new pupils at the end of the first year and a further five after that. By 1790 discussion of finding a bigger site had begun. It was decided that a new building would be built. The place for the new school was St George's Fields, that is today 28 Westminster Bridge Road. Battersea Rise (\\"Clapham J\\") St John's Hill, Battersea Rise was the school's third location, although there seems to have been some confusion as to whether the school was in Battersea, Clapham, Wandsworth, or Putney when its address was written down. The girls, however, referred to it as Clapham J. In 1853, when the site was purchased, it was because of its wide open aspect and country air, qualities that would later be lost. The school, however, was still expanding; and in 1918, the junior girls moved to a new junior school in Weybridge, Surrey. The girls of Alexandra house 1966 Rickmansworth Park The front entrance of the current Rickmansworth school. By June 1926, the school was again ready to move, to a site in Rickmansworth standing in of land with a mansion (although reports suggest this was in a state of disrepair.) To ensure that the site would be suitable for many years to come, a lot of thought was put into the design of the new school buildings, and the following recommendations were made: * the buildings should be appropriate for 400 girls * the boarding houses should house 50 girls, with each dormitory sleeping 16 * classrooms should be suitable for classes of 30 * there could be a central dining room capable of seating all 400 at one time * that a gymnasium, swimming bath, and chapel were required John Leopold Denman, an architect from Brighton, won the commission to design the school. The Weybridge Girls RMS Weybridge 1963 Originally, RMS Rickmansworth was just for the senior girls (aged 12 and above); but in 1973, it was decided that RMS Weybridge, where the junior school was, would move to join their older sisters, forming the combined site that it is today. History Food and clothing We understand far more about nutrition now than was understood when the school began. A diet table was drawn up for the girls that was partly transcribed from other charities and partly based on the observations of Mr Boys, a governor and surgeon. The diet allowed a ration of 2 pounds of meat per child per week. Below shows the menu for breakfast, dinner, and supper. Sunday--Rice milk; Roast beef, vegetables, bread; Bread, butter Monday--Water Gruel; Suet pudding ; Bread, cheese, Tuesday--Milk Porridge; Boiled mutton, vegetables, bread, ; Broth and bread Wednesday--Rice Milk; Suet puddings, potatoes, bread; Bread, butter Thursday--Water Gruel; Boiled beef, vegetables, bread; Broth and bread Friday --Milk Porridge; Rice puddings; Bread, cheese Saturday--Rice and milk; Boiled beef, vegetables, bread; Broth and bread The war years WWI Unlike the Second World War, much of what went on was away from home and life at the school continued pretty much as normal. Two exceptions include an incident in 1917 where the school was damaged by anti-aircraft fire, and 1919 when the girls gave up their prizes on prize day so that the money could be given to charity. WWII In order to protect the girls from the expected aerial bombardment, an air raid shelter had been dug out. This was behind the boarding house formerly known as Ruspini and now known as Alexandra. The shelter was commonly referred to as the trenches and consisted of tunnels that zig-zagged with a room at intervals for boiling a kettle or dispensing medicines. The tunnels were lined with benches wide and each girl was allocated a place she must find in a raid. They were all kept together in houses, and each section was given a name such as Ruspini Row, Atholl Square, Cumberland Place, and Moira Mansions. The girls themselves wanted to play their part and formed their own land army, tending the kitchen gardens at the school to provide fruit and vegetables and helping out with domestic duties. They also adopted 3 ships, but most notably the Ocean Courier. The girls knitted socks, gloves, and other items which were sent to the ship at Christmas. In return, Captain Crastion, the ship's captain, sent the school 36 pounds of toffee. The captain visited the school, and he and his ship also took part in the action on D-Day, carrying men and munitions.

Others include the children's TV series The Demon Headmaster, Inspector Morse, and EastEnders. It was recently the venue for 'Skate Camp' on CBBC show, Skate Nation and on the Kevin Bishop show for British High School Musical RMS Traditions The School Badge Traditional crest taken from a school bookmark RMS Badge taken from a school blazer as from 1990 At each side of the design are two pillars. In the centre is a five-pointed star. At the bottom of the new badge, and centre of the old badge is the ‚Äúsmooth Ashlar‚Äù. At the top of the old badge are the letters R.M.I.G standing for Royal Masonic Institution for girls. On the new badge is the school motto, Circumornatae ut similitudo templi, which is the Vulgate version of a phrase from Psalm 144:12: ‚ÄúThat our daughters may be as the polished corners of the temple.‚Äù School Drill The school drill is akin to something expected on an army parade ground. Some of it originates in Swedish Drill, and some is based on callisthenics. When exercising began to be incorporated into girls' education there were no trained women P.E. teachers, so drilling was under the guidance of an Army drill instructor. The marching, counter marching and arm stretches were considered the only exercise suitable for a young lady. Drill was described originally as callisthenics, exercises and marching but no one is entirely sure when school drill began. In an extract from the school magazine Machio in 1962, school drill is purported to be a hundred years old. There is a reference to it in an account of prize day 1876 although it is not referred to as drill. It was performed to music on a piano, later 2 grand pianos, and consisted of 180 girls (the number of degrees in a semicircle). In 1980 the music was recorded and the spoken commands gave way to a whistle. The girls learn their positions (based on their height, and thus changing from year to year and needing to be re-learned) and move in time to the music from one point to the next. The end of the performance is marked by the girls producing the Masonic emblem of set square and compass, and the point, the smallest child in the performance marching forward alone to complete the symbol. Duos and Trios Duos and Trios are a tradition upheld at prize day. 6 pianos in a row are played by either 2 (duos) or 3 (trios) girls simultaneously. Ashlar The Ashlar silver badge of the RMS School. The Ashlar is the silver badge that all RMS girls strive to achieve by the end of Year 11. The award of the Ashlar shows that a girl has been recognised for her contribution to school life, her sense of personal responsibility and her responsibility to others. The school motto comes from Psalm 144, ‚ÄúThat our daughters may be as the polished cornerstones of the Temple.‚Äù Environment The Royal Masonic School for Girls occupies a site of , of which was once Rickmansworth Deer Park. It is a haven to a wide variety of flora and fauna, almost an island of tranquillity within the M25. There are two Dells, over 40 feet deep, in which the herd of fallow deer, that were on the estate when it was a Deer Park, used to be wintered. The Dells were originally dug for the limestone that was used as road bottoming.

The company was established in 2003. A manufacturer of computer vision inspection systems, it is one of several local hi-tech companies created as spinoffs or inspired by research conducted at the Queen's University of Belfast.Armstrong P.J. and Antonis J.(2000). ECCV 2000, Book Series Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Queen's University of Belfast, Computer Aided Manufacturing Research Group, Three Dimensional Modelling Using Active Computer Vision  Technology  InspecVision specialises in the design manufacture of computer vision based measurement systems for industrial applications. Their product range include the Planar 2D systems, the Opti-Scan 3D, the Opti-Probe and the SurfScan. While there are many manufacturers of 3D computer vision systems, these systems utilize either 3D scanning technologies or a moving camera to measure an object or scene.Pham D.T. and Alcock R.J. (2003). Smart Inspection Systems: Techniques and Applications of Intelligent Vision. Academic Press. . InspecVision Ltd. produces primarily 2D or 2&1/2D as well as 3D computer vision systems and its customers are often manufacturers of 2D and 3D components such as sheet metal components or gaskets or plastic mouldings. Furthermore, unlike other 3D or 2D computer vision systems InspecVision Ltd. have developed a technology which requires no moving parts, rather a single fixed ultra-high resolution digital camera is used to measure the entire object with a single image.Ferret, Australia These systems perform measurement times that are usually much less than a second. A completely static system also precludes the rigorous recalibration requirements of other moving camera or computer vision systems. In 2017 InspecVision re The InspecVision 2D inspection system Planar is the world's fastest, using only a table, lights and a PC hundreds of thousands of measurements are taken in 0.2 seconds. There are no moving components and the measurements are taken using a very high resolution camera, which scans parts placed on a backlit glass surface. It can be used for inspection and reverse engineering of flat opaque and semi-transparent parts. The Planar system has been designed specifically for speed, accuracy and ease of use. The 2D process can measure every feature completely. Planar can produce multiple report types automatically with minimal input from the operator. To inspect, the operator places the part on the measurement surface and with a single click or scan of a barcode. This patented technology has been the recipient of several international awards, including \\"Best Quality Control System\\" at the MACH 2006 MWP Awards and 2 SMART Awards.Queen's University of Belfast, Research & Development Technology Transfer Programmes, page 9 The SurfScan integrates with the Planar 2D automatic inspection software to allow inspection of both the parts 2D shape and its 2 ¬ΩD features with a single click. The high- resolution digital camera of the measurement system captures more than 20 million data points in one second with a single scan. The Opti-Scan 3D is non- contact white light scanning system. The system consists of a projector and a high resolution camera mounted side by side. Scans are achieved by projecting a series of stripes onto the part, the projected stripes are then captured with the camera and the images analysed to produce a 3D point cloud of the scanned surface. Because the system measures every visible surface every time it scans the part, it is likely to detect minuscule and extra features. In addition, because the optical CMM produces a measurement at every pixel in the camera, it can process the highly ordered data much more easily than the disordered point clouds from laser scanners mounted on traditional CMM devices. The InspecVision Opti-Scan systems use patented technology to create both surface and edge measurements achieving unprecedented levels of accuracy. Opti-Scan 3D can offer you single click inspection, mobile large volume scanning and is also the world's only system that can measure edges in 3D. The Opti-Probe is an Optical CMM system that allows the user to inspect larger objects. The Opti-Probe can be used on the factory floor and is compatible with other InspecVision systems. In 2017 InspecVision launched the Accuity system which is an automated, large field of view, telecentric gauging system that can scan in both 2D and 3D.

He represented Virginia's 10th congressional district, consisting of suburbs of Arlington, Falls Church and sections of Fairfax County and Alexandria, and became known for his advocacy for federal workers (and constituent services) as well as his opposition to integration in the 1950s and 1960s.Dennis Hevesi, \\"Joel T. Broyhill, 86, Congressman Who Opposed Integration, Dies\\", The New York Times, October 4, 2006 Early life and education Although according to family genealogy, the first Broyhill emigrated to Halifax County, Virginia in the 18th century, Joel Broyhill's grandfather, Thomas Jefferson Broyhill (1852-1935) had been born near Moravian Falls in Wilkes County, North Carolina, the son of William Broyhill, a farmer and miller who also taught school following the Civil War. Thomas Broyhill became a carpenter and millwright, then leading citizen of the area as he established sawmills and other businesses. Joel's father Marvin Talmadge Broyhill Sr. moved his family to Hopewell, Virginia to follow an uncle who worked for the DuPont Powder Company. M.T. Broyhill occasionally worked for DuPont, as well as established a real estate business which thrived until the plant closed.http://www.broyhill.org/virgina_writers_project/virginia_writers_project- thomas_j_Broyhill.htm At the age of eighteen, Broyhill moved to Arlington, Virginia when his father relocated his building and real estate firm, M.T. Broyhill & Sons Corporation (in part developing housing near Front Royal, Virginia where DuPont established a cellulose factory). He then attended George Washington University from 1939-1941\\\\. Military service and real estate career In February 1942, Joel Broyhill enlisted in the United States Army. He served in European Theater as a captain in the 106th Infantry Division. He narrowly escaped death when Allied planes bombed the Nazis, and suffered what proved to be lifetime partial hearing loss from the explosions. Captured by the Germans during the Battle of the Bulge, Broyhill escaped six months later from a prisoner-of-war camp and rejoined advancing U.S. forces. He was released from active duty November 1, 1945. Among his military awards was a Bronze Star Medal. After the war, Broyhill rejoined his family's real estate firm, where he became partner and general manager. Politics He was president of the Arlington County Chamber of Commerce and chairman of the Arlington County Planning Commission. In 1950 he was elected president of the Arlington Republican Club. Elected to Congress In 1952 he ran for Congress in a bid to become the first representative of Virginia's new , and won on his 33rd birthday. Broyhill defeated Democrat Edmund D. Campbell by 322 votes, riding the coattails of the Dwight D. Eisenhower and Republican Party landslide that year. He won his next ten elections but lost during the Democratic landslide in 1974 in the wake of the Watergate scandal and the resignation of President Richard Nixon. Broyhill's district had been carved out of the old , then represented by Howard W. \\"Judge\\" Smith, a legendary and powerful Democrat who controlled legislation through his chairmanship of the House Rules Committee. The Washington Post wrote Congressional career After taking office, Broyhill developed a reputation for assisting federal employees, as well as constituent service that became legendary. A messenger came to his office every 30 minutes to pick up the Western Union telegrams his office would fire off to government agencies on behalf of constituents. The Washington Post wrote: Broyhill served on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, as well as the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee. In 1963, he was joined in the House by his distant cousin Jim Broyhill, also a Republican and who had won an unexpected victory in North Carolina's 9th congressional district, and who would also become known for his constituent services. Congressman Frank Wolf later noted: On national issues, Broyhill supported the Republican legislative programs of Eisenhower and Nixon. In the Democratic administrations of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, he opposed programs of the New Frontier and the Great Society. Broyhill also became known as a strident opponent of integration. In 1955, he was one 81 US Representatives who vowed to oppose by \\"every lawful means\\", the U.S. Supreme Court holding in Brown v. Board of Education which outlawed segregation. He and Richard Harding Poff of Virginia were the only two Republicans to sign the Southern Manifesto. Broyhill voted against the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but voted in favor of the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. As a longtime member of the committee overseeing the District of Columbia he, along with three other members of Congress, recommended that schools in the District reinstitute segregation. In 1974 he announced his intention to retire, but was persuaded to seek another term at the request of Vice President Gerald R. Ford. He ended up losing to Democrat Joseph L. Fisher, as the GOP suffered landslide defeats in reaction to the Watergate scandal. His defeat was considered one of the biggest upsets nationally that year. After leaving office, he served as campaign manager for Senator John W. Warner's successful first run, but primarily he was involved with real estate. His firm developed several neighborhoods in Northern Virginia, including Broyhill McLean Estates, Broyhill Forest, and Sterling Park.  Death and legacy  In 2000, Congress named the postal building at 8409 Lee Hwy. in Merrifield, Virginia after Broyhill, though no plaque remains in public areas. Broyhill died at his home in Arlington, Virginia of congestive heart failure and pneumonia on September 24, 2006. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. His papers are held among the special collections of George Mason University.

The station's studios and administration offices were located at Association Hall, Main Street, Jamestown. It was the only independent radio station broadcasting on Saint Helena, and was also the island's only FM station. The station also broadcast via the Internet and was relayed by stations in Ascension Island and the Falkland Islands. The organisation also produces a weekly newspaper, the St Helena Independent which continues despite the closure of SaintFM. The managing director of the station was Mikael Olsson.Saint FM evacuated , Saint.fm, Retrieved 2010-08-02 The radio channels vacated by Saint FM have been taken over by Saint FM Community Radio. Also Saint Fm 94.7 closed down on 31 April 2018 at midnight. History Saint FM was started by Johnny Drummond, whose bequest provided the initial funding for the station. Talks about the new station began in August 2003 between Drummond and the current station manager of Saint FM, Mike Olsson. Negotiations started soon afterwards and the broadcasting licence was issued on 22 July 2004. The station commenced test transmissions on the Internet on 28 September 2004, and on FM via a temporary aerial on 27 September 2004. After three months of test transmissions Saint FM officially opened with scheduled broadcasts on 3 January 2005. In June 2006 broadcasts commenced in Ascension Island on 91.4 MHz, locally re-broadcast by VT Merlin Communications. On 1 September 2006 Saint FM began broadcasting to Stanley on the Falkland Islands on 95.5 MHz. The re-broadcast service was provided by KTV Ltd on the Falkland Islands under the title 'KTV Radio Nova Saint FM', and was extended to cover residents in the vicinity of RAF Mount Pleasant. The station closed on 21 December 2012.  Closure  Saint FM posted the following on Wednesday 19 December 2012 on its Facebook page:Saint FM Facebook page SaintFM closed down at 4p.m. on 21 December 2012. After a brief speech from the station's owner, Mikael Olsson, the final record played was The Carnival Is Over by The Seekers. Then the transmitter was switched off. Programmes The majority of programming was music-based with a significant number of requests being played for islanders from relatives and friends overseas and vice versa. As befits the musical preference of the many Saint Helenians much country music was played, but most popular music styles from the last 50 years were featured. Weekday daytime programmes were usually presented by station staff, with evenings and weekends programming done by 'voluntary presenters'. 'Local news' (which also included events on Ascension Island and the Falkland Islands) was broadcast throughout the day. The station also did international news bulletins as well as international and local sports updates throughout the day. The programming style could best be described as 'informal'. Many of the station's requests were placed by 'Saints' contacting relatives worldwide. As a commercial station, Saint FM played adverts for local businesses. Some of these are still available online.http://media.burghhouse.com/saintfmadverts.htm Saint Helena Frequencies Although Saint Helena is a small island its terrain is such that island-wide coverage requires more than one transmitter. The main island transmitter was at High Knoll Fort, and radiated on 93.1 MHz. From this were also fed: * a relay at The Flag, for the Levelwood area, opened July 2007, which operated on 95.1 MHz. * a relay for the Blue Hill and Barren Ground area, on 91.1 MHz from the Head 'O Wain TV transmitter site. The High Knoll Fort transmitter was itself fed from a transmitter located at the studios in Jamestown, which radiated on 106.7 MHz. This transmitter also provided a service in Jamestown. FM DX Because of its remoteness Saint FM was interested to hear from people who could receive the station at unusually long distances, for example in Africa or at sea, direct from its main 93.1 MHz FM transmitter on Saint Helena.

Mayhar wrote over 60 books ranging from science fiction to horror to young adult to historical to westerns, Some of her novels appeared under pseudonyms such as Frank Cannon, Frances Hurst, and John Killdeer. Mayhar began writing fantasy with a story in 1973, and fantasy novels in 1979 after returning with her family to Texas from Oregon. Mayhar also shared her knowledge of the skills of writing with many people through the Writer's Digest correspondence courses, and via her acclaimed book Through a Stone Wall: Lessons from Thirty Years of Writing. Personal life Mayhar was born at Timpson, Texas, and was first inspired to write by finding Arthur Merritt's fantasy The Face in the Abyss (1931) on a remote rural news-stand at age 15.\\"Deep Woods Lady\\", Starlog issue #159, October 1990 (a long interview with Ardath Mayhar) Her early life story can be found in full in her autobiography Strange View from a Skewed Orbit, but a few years after going full-time as a fantasy and science-fiction writer she summed up her life for the biographical encyclopedia for libraries, Something about the author (1985). There she stated that: :\\"I have spent most of my adult life shovelling manure, writing poetry, and looking up at the stars. ... hand-to-hand (sometimes face-to-hoof) with the cows, the cruddy milking machines, the manure, the hay, the weather. ... At the age of forty-three, I ‚Äòreformed‚Äô ... I finally realized that English teachers have destroyed any love of poetry that might remain in the English-speaking race ... so I started writing fantasy novels, and haven‚Äôt looked back in the years since. I have been influenced, to a greater or lesser extent, by Charles Dickens, Shakespeare, Ayn Rand, Andre Norton, William Faulkner, and all the ‚Äòold heads‚Äô in the science fiction field.\\"Something about the author, 1985, page 142. Mayhar escaped from the dairy farm to run a bookstore. She owned and operated The View From Orbit Bookstore in Nacogdoches, Texas, with her husband Joe. She later sold the bookstore, which served the students of Stephen F. Austin State University and people in the East Texas area, providing a wide variety of books and literature as well as Joe's computer services that would otherwise have been unavailable to the region at that time. Work She moved back to Texas to become an active fantasy and science-fiction writer, and lived on a place bordering the Attoyac River\\"Deep Woods Lady\\", Starlog issue #159, October 1990 (a long interview with Ardath Mayhar) as it entered the Sam Rayburn Lake, which is in the Big Thicket country (today just outside the official Big Thicket National Preserve). The imaginative work she produced at that time has been compared to that of Andre Norton and Clifford Simak. Like Simak she often places rural people of straightforward decency into strange situations. Her fantasy stories have often been compared to Lord Dunsany for their delicacy and settings. Her juvenile novels (what would now be called 'young adult') were sharply divided between her 'East Texas' series with regional settings, and her fantasy works for that age-group. She often featured strong-minded and morally-certain adolescent girl heroines at a time when it was not fashionable to do so. This focus arose simply from her own background, not from politics.Something about the author, 1985, page 142. Until her health began to fail, her reputation was such that she still spoke regularly in the area, drawing large crowds whenever she taught and spoke. She also attended occasional fan conventions, where she was treated like royalty by great writers such as Harlan Ellison: :\\"the transformation that came over Ellison [when he saw Mayhar walk in at Aggiecon 2000] was immediate and dramatic. He dropped everything and literally doted on Ardath. He got her a seat, brought her into the conversation and went out of his way to defer to her.\\"No Fear of the Future, \\"Ardath Mayhar has passed away\\", February 2012 Her work was also acclaimed by noted author Andre Norton, and Joe R. Lansdale wrote simply: \\"Ardath Mayhar writes damn fine books!\\" Papers The main collection of her papers is the Ardath Mayhar Papers at the East Texas Research Center of the Stephen F. Austin State University. There is also an Ardath Mayhar Papers collection at The University of Southern Mississippi. Awards Mayhar was nominated for the Mark Twain Award, and won the Balrog Award for a horror narrative poem in Masques I, and had numerous other nominations for awards in almost every fiction genre, and won many awards for poetry.

By default, without any annotation, a symbol in an object file is strong. During linking, a strong symbol can override a weak symbol of the same name. In contrast, two strong symbols that share a name yield a link error during link-time. When linking a binary executable, a weakly declared symbol does not need a definition. In comparison, (by default) a declared strong symbol without a definition triggers an undefined symbol link error. Weak symbols are not mentioned by the C or C++ language standards; as such, inserting them into code is not very portable. Even if two platforms support the same or similar syntax for marking symbols as weak, the semantics may differ in subtle points, e.g. whether weak symbols during dynamic linking at runtime lose their semantics or not.  Syntax  The GNU Compiler Collection and the Solaris Studio C compiler share the same syntax for annotating symbols as weak, namely a special #pragma, \`#pragma weak\`, and, alternatively, a function and variable attribute, \`__attribute__((weak))\`.  Pragma  // function declaration #pragma weak power2 int power2(int x);  Attribute  // function declaration int __attribute__((weak)) power2(int x); // or int power2(int x) __attribute__((weak)); // variable declaration; extern int __attribute__((weak)) global_var;  Tools support  The nm command identifies weak symbols in object files, libraries, and executables. On Linux a weak function symbol is marked with \\"W\\" if a weak default definition is available, and with \\"w\\" if it is not. Weakly defined variable symbols are marked with \\"V\\" and \\"v\\". On Solaris \\"nm\\" prints \\"WEAK\\" instead of \\"GLOB\\" for a weak symbol.  Examples  The following examples work on Linux and Solaris with GCC and Solaris Studio.  Static example  : #include #include #include \\"power_slow.h\\" int main(int argc, char **argv) { fprintf(stderr, \\"power3() = %d \\", power3(atoi(argv[1]))); return 0; } power_slow.h: #ifndef POWER2_SLOW_H #define POWER2_SLOW_H // alternative syntax // #pragma weak power2 int __attribute__((weak)) power2(int x) // alternatively after symbol // __attribute__((weak)) ; int power3(int x); #endif : #include #include \\"power_slow.h\\" int power2(int x) { fprintf(stderr, \\"slow power2() \\"); return x*x; } int power3(int x) { return power2(x)*x; } : #include int power2(int x) { fprintf(stderr, \\"fast power2() \\"); return x*x; } Build commands: cc -g -c -o main.o main.c cc -g -c -o power_slow.o power_slow.c cc -g -c -o power.o power.c cc main.o power_slow.o -o cc main.o power_slow.o power.o -o fast Output: $ ./slow 3 slow power2 power3() = 27 $ ./fast 3 fast power2 power3() = 27 When removing the weak attribute and re-executing the build commands, the last one fails with the following error message (on Linux): multiple definition of \`power2' The second-last one still succeeds, and \`./slow\` has the same output.  Shared example  Taking main.c from the preceding example and adding: #ifndef NO_USER_HOOK void user_hook(void) { fprintf(stderr, \\"main: user_hook() \\"); } #endif Replacing power_slow.c with: #include #include \\"power_slow.h\\" void __attribute__((weak)) user_hook(void); #ifdef ENABLE_DEF void user_hook(void) { fprintf(stderr, \\"power_slow: user_hook() \\"); } #endif int power2(int x) { if (user_hook) // only needed ifndef ENABLE_DEF user_hook(); return x*x; } int power3(int x) { return power2(x)*x; } Build commands: cc -g -c -o main.o main.c cc -g -fpic -c -o power_slow.po power_slow.c cc -shared -fpic -o libpowerslow.so power_slow.po cc main.o power_slow.po -L\`pwd\` -Wl,-R\`pwd\` -lpowerslow -o main cc -g -DENABLE_DEF -fpic -c -o power_slow.po power_slow.c cc -shared -fpic -o libpowerslow.so power_slow.po cc main.o power_slow.po -L\`pwd\` -Wl,-R\`pwd\` -lpowerslow -o main2 cc -g -DNO_USER_HOOK -c -o main.o main.c cc -g -fpic -c -o power_slow.po power_slow.c cc -shared -fpic -o libpowerslow.so power_slow.po cc main.o power_slow.po -L\`pwd\` -Wl,-R\`pwd\` -lpowerslow -o main3 cc -g -DNO_USER_HOOK -c -o main.o main.c cc -g -DENABLE_DEF -fpic -c -o power_slow.po power_slow.c cc -shared -fpic -o libpowerslow.so power_slow.po cc main.o power_slow.po -L\`pwd\` -Wl,-R\`pwd\` -lpowerslow -o main4 Output: $ ./main 3 main: user_hook() power3() = 27 $ ./main2 3 main: user_hook() power3() = 27 $ ./main3 3 power3() = 27 $ ./main4 3 power_slow: user_hook() power3() = 27 Removing the weak attribute and re-executing the build commands does not yield build errors and leads to the same output (on Linux) for \`main\` and \`main2\`. The build commands for the \`main3\` lead to following warning and error messages (on Linux): warning: the address of ‚Äòuser_hook‚Äô will always evaluate as ‚Äòtrue‚Äô libpowerslow.so: undefined reference to \`user_hook' The warning is issued by the compiler because it can statically determine that in if (user_hook) the expression \`user_hook\` evaluates always to true, because it contains an ELF jump table entry. The error message is issued by the linker. The build for \`main4\` includes the same warning but no link error.  Use cases  Weak symbols can be used as a mechanism to provide default implementations of functions that can be replaced by more specialized (e.g. optimized) ones at link-time. The default implementation is then declared as weak, and, on certain targets, object files with strongly declared symbols are added to the linker command line. If a library defines a symbol as weak, a program that links that library is free to provide a strong one for, say, customization purposes. Another use case for weak symbols is the maintenance of binary backward compatibility.  Limitations  On UNIX System V descendent systems, during program runtime the dynamic linker resolves weak symbols definitions like strong ones. For example, a binary is dynamically linked against libraries libfoo.so and libbar.so. libfoo defines symbol \`f\` and declares it as weak. libbar also defines \`f\` and declares it as strong. Depending on the library ordering on the link command line (i.e. \`-lfoo -lbar\`) the dynamic linker uses the weak f from libfoo.so although a strong version is available at runtime. The GNU \`ld\` provides the environment variable \`LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK\` to provide weak semantics for the dynamic linker. When using constructs like #pragma weak func void func(); void bar() { if (func) func(); } , depending on the compiler and used optimization level, the compiler may interpret the conditional as always true (because \`func\` can be seen as undefined from a standards point of view). An alternative to the above construct is using a system API to check if \`func\` is defined (e.g. dlsym with \`RTLD_DEFAULT\`). The above check may also fail for other reasons, e.g. when func contains an elf jump table entry. Using weak symbols in static libraries has other semantics than in shared ones, i.e. with a static library the symbol lookup stops at the first symbol ‚Äì even if it is just weak and an object file with a strong symbol is also included in the library archive. On Linux, the linker option \`--whole-archive\` changes that behavior. The weak function attribute is supposed to be used on function declarations. Using it on a function definition may yield unexpected results, depending on the compiler and optimization level. In Solaris, the weak symbols are also used within kernel. The generic part of kernel (called \`genunix\`) specifies weak functions that are overridden in platform specific part of the kernel (called \`unix\`) such as Virtual memory routines. The kernel runtime linker sets the addresses of these functions when the kernel is combined together in memory during boot. This does not work for kernel loadable modules though - weak symbol in the kernel is not replaced with kernel module symbol when the module is loaded.  Related methods  C preprocessor (CPP) conditional constructs can also be used to switch between different versions of a symbol. The difference from weak symbols is that weak symbols are interpreted by the linker. The CPP is run during the compilation of each translation unit before the C compiler. The build process (e.g. make) can be implemented in a conditional way such that just different versions of a symbol are created or different (specialized) libraries are used and linked depending on the target.

He is a former BBC North America Editor and the main co-presenter of BBC One's Breakfast News programme. Since August 2009, he has co-presented the Today programme on BBC Radio 4, BBC press release. Website accessed 26 August 2009 and also regularly writes for the Radio Times. Early life In an article in the Radio Times in January 2011, Webb revealed that his natural father was Peter Woods who was formerly a reporter with the Daily Mirror and later became a BBC newsreader. Woods was married and Webb's mother, then Gloria Crocombe, was a secretary at the Daily Mirror and was divorced from her first husband at the time of the affair with Woods.Justin Webb Obituary: Gloria Webb, theguardian.com, 2 October 2006. Still an unnamed \\"married man\\" at this point. Webb commented that his mother's split from Woods may have been as much her doing as his, saying \\"I do not believe she was abandoned\\". Woods provided financially for Webb but saw his son only once, when he was six months old. Webb took the surname of his stepfather when his mother remarried in 1964. Webb grew up in Bath. He was educated at Sidcot School, a Quaker school in Somerset, and the London School of Economics, where he was editor of student newspaper The Beaver. Career Webb joined the BBC as a graduate trainee in 1984 working in Northern Ireland for BBC Radio Ulster based in Belfast. He then worked as a reporter for BBC Radio 4's Today programme, before becoming a foreign affairs correspondent based in London and covering news around the world. He reported on the Gulf War and the war in Bosnia, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the first democratic elections in South Africa. He then became a BBC News presenter based in London, and the main presenter on BBC One's Breakfast News programme from 1992 to 1997. He also presented the BBC's One and Six O'Clock News bulletins and presented BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight from 1997‚Äì1998. From 1998 he spent three years working as the BBC's Europe correspondent based in Brussels. During that time he reported on the workings of the European Commission and Parliament, the politics surrounding Britain's decision on whether to join the single currency and the enlargement on the European Union. In 2001, Webb moved to the United States, as the BBC's chief Washington correspondent. BBC Website accessed 8 February 2008 Much of his time was spent on local Washington Radio, most notably, WAMU, a public radio station, on The Diane Rehm Show. He raised eyebrows within the BBC in 2006 when, at a seminar on impartiality, he said the corporation was anti-American and treated the US with \\"scorn and derision\\", according it \\"no moral weight\\". The American Expatriate blog. Website accessed 19 November 2007 He has also presented a Radio 4 series on anti-Americanism. Media Guardian article Monday 5 November 2007. Website accessed 18 November 2007 In December 2007, he became North American Editor for BBC News, a role newly created in time for the American presidential election of 2008. BBC Website accessed 19 November 2007 He replaced Matt Frei who moved to present the new World News America bulletin. Since November 2007, Webb has maintained a regularly updated blog on the BBC website. In August 2009, Webb returned to the UK to replace Edward Stourton on BBC Radio 4's early morning news programme Today. In October 2017, Webb disclosed that his presenting colleague Nick Robinson was being paid ¬£100,000 more than him, for doing \\"essentially the same job\\". Webb's pay amounted to ¬£200,000, whilst Robinson's reached ¬£300,000, despite his joining the programme six years before. Webb promoted that the era of the \\"big beast\\" news anchor would likely be drawing to a close, with the \\"very well-paid\\" John Humphrys and Huw Edwards \\"in the firing line\\". Personal life Webb married his long-term partner Sarah Gordon in the early 2000s. They have three children together: Martha, Sam and Clara. Whilst in the United States, their son Sam fell ill and was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus. As a result, Webb experienced the United States healthcare system first-hand. His son commonly joins his father in speaking about the disease. In 2012, Webb joined son Sam at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, meeting the Duchess of Cornwall as she visited the facilities. She later became a Royal Patron of the children's charity, JDRF, a charity which Webb supports on a regular basis. In August 2009, Webb returned to Britain with his wife and children. They currently live in Camberwell, South London. In 2008, his mother, Gloria, died and he inherited her home in Bath, Somerset.

It is a common garden and lawn weed in the United States. Prostrate spurge growing on disturbed soil It grows in sunny locations and a variety of soils, and functions as a pioneer species in ecological succession. The sap of this plant is a mild skin irritant and can cause a rash in some people. The sap is poisonous and considered carcinogenic. Description Euphorbia maculata is typically prostrate, with specimens rarely reaching up as high as . The stems spread out in a mat along the ground with each stem rarely greater than long. The leaves are oval but rather elongate, up to long, and arranged in opposite pairs. The cyathia, bisexual reproductive structures unique to plants in the genus, are very small, with four white petal-like appendages that are sometimes pink. The leaves are often are marked with a reddish spot in the center, a feature that led to the common name of spotted spurge. It is similar to Euphorbia prostrata, but that species has shorter leaves that are more rounded at the tips. It may occasionally be confused with Euphorbia serpens but the very short and rounded leaves of E. serpens in combination with the larger (but still inconspicuous) cyathia should remove any potential for confusion.

MING rose to prominence during the American drum and bass and turntablist movements in the late 1990s alongside DJs such as Z-Trip, DJ Spooky, The Beat Junkies, J-Boogie and DJ Craze. Early life He was born in Syosset, New York, United States. He grew up in Stony Brook, New York and attended Ward Melville High School. He attended University of Miami where He graduated with honors with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering with an emphasis in audio. Early career MING was one half of the experimental hip-hop and turntablist duo, Ming + FS, founded in 1996. The duo used breakbeats as the foundation for most of their work, but were best known for eschewing musical boundaries, freely incorporating elements of house, electro and drum and bass into their music. They dubbed this smashed-up style \\"junkyard\\", a moniker that got picked up in dance music press, and on their own releases (like 1998's ‚ÄúJunkyard Drum ‚Äòn‚Äô Bass‚Äù). Over the course of a decade, Ming + FS performed over 1,000 live shows in the United States and abroad. The pair released three albums on San Francisco based Om Records; Hell's Kitchen, The Human Condition and Subway Series. Ming + FS also released a five-song EP Applied Pressure on Sound Gizmo Records and a fourth album on NYC based Spun Records entitled Back to One, as well as many singles on their own Madhattan Studios label. In 2003, MING co-wrote five songs on Toby Lightman's debut record Little Things on Lava Records. Current career In 2006, MING opened his own label and music production company, Hood Famous Music (HFM), which he co-runs with Jumpshot, in New York City. MING has produced remixes for Beyonc√©, Black Eyed Peas, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry and developed artists such as Michael Lynche, a fourth-place finisher on season 9 of American Idol. Lynche's \\"What Would You Say\\" was licensed for the film, Madea Goes to Jail. In 2007, he opened Habitat Music which focuses on music for film, television and movies. In 2010, MING wrote a monthly column in Electronic Musician magazine called 'Production Central', which focussed on record production technique. He also had a monthly video blog on ElectronicMusician.com that was part artists interviews and part recording technics. In 2011, MING began regularly releasing electro house singles on HFM. In 2012 he released MING+2beeps KING KONG EP on Steve Aoki's Dim Mak Records. In 2014, he released a trap and bass EP entitled ‚ÄúBlackout‚Äù on Datsik's Firepower Records. In 2015, he was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical for his remix of \\"Crossfingers - Falling Out\\" feat. Danny Losito. Commercial work MING has produced original music for top television series including CSI: NY, CSI: Miami, Sex and the City, Weeds, Dinner Take All, and Travel Spies. MING has also created commercial scores for Sears, Nissan, Burger King, Nokia, AT&T;, Doritos and Chevy. (note MING's cameo in the Nissan commercial).

Gross and Lev Petrovich Pitaevskii) describes the ground state of a quantum system of identical bosons using the Hartree‚ÄìFock approximation and the pseudopotential interaction model. A Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate (BEC) is a gas of bosons that are in the same quantum state, and thus can be described by the same wavefunction. A free quantum particle is described by a single-particle Schr√∂dinger equation. Interaction between particles in a real gas is taken into account by a pertinent many-body Schr√∂dinger equation. In the Hartree‚ÄìFock approximation, the total wave-function \\\\Psi of the system of N bosons is taken as a product of single-particle functions \\\\psi, : \\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{r}_1,\\\\mathbf{r}_2,\\\\dots,\\\\mathbf{r}_N)=\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}_1)\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}_2)\\\\dots\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}_N) where \\\\mathbf{r}_i is the coordinate of the i-th boson. If the average spacing between the particles in a gas is greater than the scattering length (that is, in the so-called dilute limit), then one can approximate the true interaction potential that features in this equation by a pseudopotential. At sufficiently low temperature where the de Broglie wavelength is much longer than the range of boson-boson interaction, the scattering process can be well approximated by the s-wave scattering (i.e. \\\\ell =0 in the partial wave analysis, a.k.a. the hard-sphere potential) term alone. In that case, the pseudopotential model Hamiltonian of the system can be written as: : H=\\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\left(-{\\\\hbar^2\\\\over 2m}{\\\\partial^2\\\\over\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{r}_i^2}+V(\\\\mathbf{r}_i)\\\\right) +\\\\sum_{i where m is the mass of the boson, V is the external potential, a_s is the boson-boson s-wave scattering length, and \\\\delta(\\\\mathbf{r}) is the Dirac delta-function. The variational method shows that if the single-particle wave- function satisfies the following Gross‚ÄìPitaevskii equation: : \\\\left(-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}{\\\\partial^2\\\\over\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{r}^2} + V(\\\\mathbf{r}) + {4\\\\pi\\\\hbar^2a_s\\\\over m}\\\\vert\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r})\\\\vert^2\\\\right)\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r})=\\\\mu\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}), the total wave-function minimizes the expectation value of the model Hamiltonian under normalization condition \\\\int dV |\\\\Psi|^2=N. Therefore, such single-particle wave-function describes the ground state of the system. GPE is a model equation for the ground-state single-particle wavefunction in a Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate. It is similar in form to the Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau equation and is sometimes referred to as the \\"nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation\\". The non-linearity of the Gross‚ÄìPitaevskii equation has its origin in the interaction between the particles: When setting the coupling constant of interaction in the Gross‚ÄìPitaevskii equation to zero (see the following section): thereby, the single-particle Schr√∂dinger equation describing a particle inside a trapping potential is recovered. Form of equation The equation has the form of the Schr√∂dinger equation with the addition of an interaction term. The coupling constant g is proportional to the s-wave scattering length a_s of two interacting bosons: :g=\\\\frac{4\\\\pi\\\\hbar^2 a_s}{m}, where \\\\hbar is the reduced Planck's constant and m is the mass of the boson. The energy density is :\\\\mathcal{E}=\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\vert abla\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{r})\\\\vert^2 + V(\\\\mathbf{r})\\\\vert\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{r})\\\\vert^2 + \\\\frac{1}{2}g\\\\vert\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{r})\\\\vert^4, where \\\\Psi is the wavefunction, or order parameter, and V is the external potential (e.g. a harmonic trap). The time-independent Gross‚ÄìPitaevskii equation, for a conserved number of particles, is :\\\\mu\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\left(-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m} abla^2 + V(\\\\mathbf{r}) + g\\\\vert\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{r})\\\\vert^2\\\\right)\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{r}) where \\\\mu is the chemical potential. The chemical potential is found from the condition that the number of particles is related to the wavefunction by :N = \\\\int\\\\vert\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{r})\\\\vert^2 \\\\, d^3r. From the time-independent Gross‚ÄìPitaevskii equation, we can find the structure of a Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate in various external potentials (e.g. a harmonic trap). The time- dependent Gross‚ÄìPitaevskii equation is :i\\\\hbar\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{r},t)}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\left(-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m} abla^2 + V(\\\\mathbf{r}) + g\\\\vert\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{r},t)\\\\vert^2\\\\right)\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{r},t). From the time- dependent Gross‚ÄìPitaevskii equation we can look at the dynamics of the Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate. It is used to find the collective modes of a trapped gas. Solutions Since the Gross‚ÄìPitaevskii equation is a nonlinear partial differential equation, exact solutions are hard to come by. As a result, solutions have to be approximated via myriad techniques. Exact solutions Free particle The simplest exact solution is the free particle solution, with V(\\\\mathbf{r}) =0, : \\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{N}{V}} e^{i\\\\mathbf{k}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{r}}. This solution is often called the Hartree solution. Although it does satisfy the Gross‚ÄìPitaevskii equation, it leaves a gap in the energy spectrum due to the interaction: : E(\\\\mathbf{k}) = N \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2k^2}{2m}+ g \\\\frac{N}{2 V}\\\\right]. According to the Hugenholtz‚ÄìPines theorem, an interacting bose gas does not exhibit an energy gap (in the case of repulsive interactions). Soliton A one-dimensional soliton can form in a Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate, and depending upon whether the interaction is attractive or repulsive, there is either a bright or dark soliton. Both solitons are local disturbances in a condensate with a uniform background density. If the BEC is repulsive, so that g>0, then a possible solution of the Gross‚ÄìPitaevskii equation is, :\\\\psi(x) = \\\\psi_0\\\\tanh\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\xi}\\\\right), where \\\\psi_0 is the value of the condensate wavefunction at \\\\infty, and \\\\xi = \\\\hbar/\\\\sqrt{2mn_0g}=1/\\\\sqrt{8\\\\pi a_s n_0} is the coherence length (a.k.a. the healing length, see below). This solution represents the dark soliton, since there is a deficit of condensate in a space of nonzero density. The dark soliton is also a type of topological defect, since \\\\psi flips between positive and negative values across the origin, corresponding to a \\\\pi phase shift. For g<0 :\\\\psi(x,t) = \\\\psi(0)e^{-i\\\\mu t/\\\\hbar}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\cosh\\\\left[\\\\sqrt{2m\\\\vert\\\\mu\\\\vert/\\\\hbar^2}x\\\\right]}, where the chemical potential is \\\\mu = g\\\\vert\\\\psi(0)\\\\vert^2/2. This solution represents the bright soliton, since there is a concentration of condensate in a space of zero density.  Healing length  The healing length can be understood as the length scale where the kinetic energy of the boson equals the chemical potential: :\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m\\\\xi^2}=\\\\mu=gn_0\\\\,. The healing length gives the shortest distance over which the wavefuction can change; It must be much smaller than any length scale in the solution of the single-particle wavefunction. The healing length also determines the size of vortices that can form in a superfluid; It's the distance over which the wavefunction recovers from zero in the center of the vortex to the value in the bulk of the superfluid (hence the name \\"healing\\" length). Variational solutions In systems where an exact analytical solution may not be feasible, one can make a variational approximation. The basic idea is to make a variational ansatz for the wavefunction with free parameters, plug it into the free energy, and minimize the energy with respect to the free parameters. Numerical solutions Several numerical methods, such as the split-step Crank‚ÄìNicolson and Fourier spectral methods, have been used for solving GPE. There are also different Fortran and C programs for its solution for the contact interaction and long-range dipolar interaction. Thomas‚ÄìFermi approximation If the number of particles in a gas is very large, the interatomic interaction becomes large so that the kinetic energy term can be neglected from the Gross‚ÄìPitaevskii equation. This is called the Thomas‚ÄìFermi approximation. :\\\\psi(x,t) = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\mu - V(x)}{Ng}} In a harmonic trap (where the potential energy is quadratic with respect to displacement from the center), this gives a density profile commonly referred to as the \\"inverted parabola\\" density profile. Bogoliubov approximation Bogoliubov treatment of the Gross‚ÄìPitaevskii equation is a method that finds the elementary excitations of a Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate. To that purpose, the condensate wavefunction is approximated by a sum of the equilibrium wavefunction \\\\psi_0=\\\\sqrt{n}e^{-i\\\\mu t} and a small perturbation \\\\delta\\\\psi, :\\\\psi = \\\\psi_0 + \\\\delta\\\\psi . Then this form is inserted in the time dependent Gross‚ÄìPitaevskii equation and its complex conjugate, and linearized to first order in \\\\delta\\\\psi :i\\\\hbar\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\delta\\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m} abla ^2 \\\\delta\\\\psi+V\\\\delta\\\\psi+g(2|\\\\psi_0|^2\\\\delta\\\\psi+\\\\psi_0^2\\\\delta\\\\psi^*) :-i\\\\hbar\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\delta\\\\psi^*}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m} abla ^2 \\\\delta\\\\psi^*+V\\\\delta\\\\psi^*+g(2|\\\\psi_0|^2\\\\delta\\\\psi^*+(\\\\psi_0^*)^2\\\\delta\\\\psi) Assuming the following for \\\\delta\\\\psi : \\\\delta\\\\psi = e^{-i\\\\mu t}(u(\\\\boldsymbol{r})e^{-i\\\\omega t} - v^*(\\\\boldsymbol{r})e^{i\\\\omega t}) one finds the following coupled differential equations for u and v by taking the e^{\\\\pm i\\\\omega t} parts as independent components : \\\\left(-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m} abla^2+V+2gn-\\\\hbar\\\\mu-\\\\hbar\\\\omega\\\\right)u-gnv = 0 : \\\\left(-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m} abla^2+V+2gn-\\\\hbar\\\\mu+\\\\hbar\\\\omega\\\\right)v-gnu = 0 For a homogeneous system, i.e. for V(\\\\boldsymbol{r})=const., one can get V=\\\\hbar\\\\mu-gn from the zeroth order equation. Then we assume u and v to be plane waves of momentum \\\\boldsymbol{q}, which leads to the energy spectrum : \\\\hbar\\\\omega = \\\\epsilon_\\\\boldsymbol{q} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2|\\\\boldsymbol{q}|^2}{2m}\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2|\\\\boldsymbol{q}|^2}{2m}+2gn \\\\right)} For large \\\\boldsymbol{q}, the dispersion relation is quadratic in \\\\boldsymbol{q} as one would expect for usual non interacting single particle excitations. For small \\\\boldsymbol{q}, the dispersion relation is linear :\\\\epsilon_\\\\boldsymbol{q} = s\\\\hbar q with s=\\\\sqrt{ng/m} being the speed of sound in the condensate, also known as second sound. The fact that \\\\epsilon_\\\\boldsymbol{q}/(\\\\hbar q)>s shows, according to Landau's criterion, that the condensate is a superfluid, meaning that if an object is moved in the condensate at a velocity inferior to s, it will not be energetically favorable to produce excitations and the object will move without dissipation, which is a characteristic of a superfluid. Experiments have been done to prove this superfluidity of the condensate, using a tightly focused blue-detuned laser. The same dispersion relation is found when the condensate is described from a microscopical approach using the formalism of second quantization.

The club was established 3 June 1895 and shares a common origin with FC Hammonia Hamburg: both sides arose out of the students group Seminarvereinigung Frisch-Auf with St. Georg being formed first on the left bank of the Alster River, and Hammonia appearing later on the right bank. Like their brother side, St. Georg was a founding member of the German Football Association (Deutscher Fussball Bund or German Football Association) at Leipzig in 1900. However, while Hammonia folded after only a short existence, St. Georg still plays today. __TOC__ History Foundation to WWI St. Georg played first class ball in the Hamburg league throughout the early part of the century until relegated at the end of the 1912‚Äì13 season. The club quickly recovered and emerged as city champions of the Hamburger-Altonaer Fussball Bund (Hamburg-Altona Football Association) in 1916 before going on to win the Norddeutscher Fussball Verband (North German Football League) regional championship. Two years later they would repeat as HAFB and NDFV champions as part of the combined wartime side KVgg St.Georger/SC Sperber. Normally, the capture of the North German regional titles would have led St. Georg to participation in the national final rounds. However, the country was embroiled in World War I and national championship play was suspended from 1915 to 1919 with league play in general being significantly reduced. After the war, SC Sperber resumed play as an independent side and in 1819 St. George entered into a new union with Hamburger TS 1816 to form the club SpVgg. (SV) St. Georg. Initially a strong side in the city league, the team soon slipped and was not able to advance again to regional level play. The union of the two clubs was dissolved in 1922. 30s and WWII St. Georg continued to play top-tier football until 1928 when the club slipped to the second division Berzirksliga for the first time. They returned to first division play after a two-season absence. In 1933 German football was re-organized under the Third Reich into sixteen top-flight divisions. However, a poor eighth-place finish the previous year saw St. Georg left behind in the Berzirksliga Hamburg (II) until 1939 when they again joined Sperber in a wartime union (Kriegspielgemeinschaft) to play as KSG Sperber/St.Georg in the Gauliga Nordmark. As a separate side Sperber had already played two seasons (1935‚Äì36 and 1936‚Äì37) in the top-flight. The newly combined side was relegated after just two seasons. The Gauliga Nordmark was split into two new divisions, the Gauliga Schleswig-Holstein and the Gauliga Hamburg in 1942, and Sperber/St.Georg returned to play in the latter division. After the 1943‚Äì44 season this club was merged with Post SG Hamburg and HSV Barmbeck-Uhlenhorst and played as KSG Alsterdorf until the end of World War II. Postwar After the end of war all organizations in Germany, including sports and football associations, were ordered dissolved by occupying Allied authorities. SV St. Georg was re-constituted in the fall of 1945 and played in the third- class city league. A 1946 merger with TS Blau-Wei√ü 1923 Hamburg helped advance the club to second division competition until league re-organization the next season again marked St Georg as a third-tier side in the Bezirksklasse Hamburg (III). In 1966 the club captured the division championship in what had by then become the Verbandsliga Hamburg-Hammonia and was promoted to the Landesliga Hamburg (III) where they immediately captured another title but were unsuccessful in a bid to move up to the Regionalliga. League re-organization in 1974 again saw the club dropped down one play class as the Landesliga Hamburg became a fourth division circuit. A highlight of the 1970s was St. Georg's participation in the 1976 German Cup competition which saw the team put out in the first round 0:4 by Bundesliga side Arminia Bielefeld. Logo of Horner Turnverein 1905 Hamburg 80s to the present However, the club faltered and by the end of the decade had begun a descent that landed it in the Kreisliga Hamburg ‚Äì Staffel Ost (VIII) in 1985. In 2000 St. Georg merged with the football side of Horner TV 1905 to create present-day club FC St.Georg-Horn im Horner TV. The team captured the Landesliga Hamburg-Hansa (VI) title in 2005 to be promoted to the Verbandsliga Hamburg (V), but were immediately relegated.

The company was originally a tire and service center founded in 1958 by Harold Coker. He would later give his son Corky Coker the opportunity to manage the antique division, which was a small percentage of the company's earnings. Corky devoted 40 years to growing the antique division of the business, eventually making it the company's primary focus. Corky retired in 2014, and he appointed Wade Kawasaki as President to oversee the operations of six companies and numerous brands under the Coker Group. In November 2018, Corky sold Coker Tire and its parent company, Coker Group, to Irving Place Capital. Wade Kawasaki and his leadership team, remained with Coker Tire. Wade is the current President and CEO. Though Coker's products retain the appearance of the old tires by using the original, refurbished molds, or new molds built from original drawings, the tires are made with modern materials. Coker Tire was given manufacturing rights by the original tire brands, and also has acquired many different tire molds of the original obsolete tires they manufacture. Coker Tire also offers wheels for collector vehicles. Tires Coker Tire sells its own brand of bias ply and radial tires, called the Coker Classic, but it also offers a number of popular brands, such as B.F.Goodrich, Firestone, U.S. Royal, Michelin, Vredestein, Excelsior and American Classic in both bias ply and radial construction. Coker Tire is the leading source for Firestone Deluxe Champion tires, as well as B.F.Goodrich Silvertown tires. Many of the tires are exact OEM replacement tires for a wide range of vintage makes and models. Coker also sells modern radial tires, manufactured with whitewalls, redlines and other sidewall treatments, built for many applications. By using refurbished original molds, the tires are authentic to the originals, while the modern manufacturing procedures and materials offer safe and reliable driving characteristics. Coker Tire's President, Corky Coker, has searched the world for discontinued molds that can be rebuilt and used for modern tire manufacturing. On any of Coker's tires with custom sidewall such as a whitewall or a redline, the particular sidewall treatment is actually a part of the manufacturing process, instead of manufacturing a tire, then applying the sidewall treatment after the fact. In 1994, Coker Tire released a radial tire with a wide whitewall, which was a first of its kind. Coker now sells many brands that offer whitewall radial tires, and distributes a modern radial tire that has the narrow tread profile and distinct shoulders of a vintage bias ply tire. These tires are very popular with enthusiasts who want the vintage look, with the increased driving comfort of a radial tire. Coker Tire also has a Performance Division, which sells mostly drag racing tires. Coker sells Phoenix Race Tires, M&H; Racemaster, Pro-Trac, and select Firestone vintage tires through its performance division. Coker has also developed a line of Firestone Indy tires, built for a variety of vintage Indy cars. Coker Tire also sells what they describe as the largest bicycle tire in the world, at 36 inches in diameter. Other unique offerings are its tires for Vintage Trucks and Military Vehicles, as well as its Vintage Motorcycle tires. Wheels Coker Tire sells wheels and wheel accessories for a wide range of applications. Most of its offerings are steel wheels, designed to replace worn out OEM wheels, on makes such as Chevrolet, Ford, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Mercury, Chrysler, Buick, Volkswagen and many others. Coker also offers OEM wire wheels for Buick, Cadillac, Chrysler, Packard, Ford Model A and Ford Thunderbird but also offers custom wire wheels for hot rods. Coker sells custom wheels for hot rods and other modified collector vehicles. Coker is also a distributor for Rocket Racing Wheels and Dayton Wire Wheels.

He was the only son of the Tudor statesman Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex ( ‚Äì 1540) and Elizabeth Wyckes (d. 1529). Gregory's father Thomas Cromwell rose from obscurity to become the chief minister of Henry VIII, who attempted to modernize government at the expense of the privileges of the nobility and church. He used his office to promote religious reform and was one of the strongest advocates of the English Reformation. In 1537, Gregory married Elizabeth, Lady Ughtred, widow of Sir Anthony Ughtred, sister to Jane Seymour and therefore became brother-in-law to Henry VIII and uncle to Edward VI. Gregory survived the dramatic fall from royal favour and subsequent execution of his father in 1540, as well as the ousting of his brother-in-law and patron, Edward Seymour in 1549. He became a wealthy landowner, owning land and property in several counties in England, mainly in Rutland and Leicestershire. Gregory's family connections had provided him with wealth, property and privileges; however, it was through his own intelligence and ability, combined with the remarkable education and training provided by his father, that he was able to benefit from them, leaving his wife and family well provided for at his death. Gregory was succeeded by his eldest son, and heir, Henry. Gregory Cromwell died in July 1551, the same month as Henry Brandon, the young Duke of Suffolk and his brother Charles. He may be the subject of two portrait miniatures by Hans Holbein the Younger. Early years Gregory Cromwell was born in London around 1520. Surviving letters suggest that the home where he lived with his father, mother and grandmother, Mercy Pryor, was a happy one. Gregory's father, Thomas Cromwell, had \\"The habit of not taking himself too seriously; the friendly and familiar atmosphere out of which this comes was evidently the atmosphere of Cromwell's house. And he seems to have early displayed that ready gratitude for kindness, that fidelity to those who had helped him, for which he became noted at home and abroad. People liked to go to his home and remembered their visit with pleasure.\\" A successful merchant and lawyer, Thomas Cromwell was a self-made man of relatively humble beginnings whose intelligence and abilities enabled him to rise to become the most powerful man in England next to the king. His own father, Walter Cromwell, had been a jack of all trades ‚Äì a blacksmith, fuller and brewer who had, from time to time, come to the attention of the authorities. Thomas Cromwell was sent to school as a boy, where he learned to read and write and was taught a little Latin. Thomas Cromwell provided a more extensive education for his own son, Gregory. Thomas Cromwell, after Hans Holbein the Younger Thomas and Elizabeth had three surviving children ‚Äì a son, Gregory, and two daughters, Anne and Grace. Thomas Cromwell's wife died early in 1529, and his daughters, Anne and Grace, are believed to have died not long after their mother. Provisions made for Anne and Grace in Thomas Cromwell's will, written on 12 July 1529, have been crossed out at a later date. Thomas Cromwell had another daughter, Jane ( ‚Äì 1580) whose early life is a complete mystery. According to Hilary Mantel, \\"Cromwell had an illegitimate daughter, and beyond the fact that she existed, we know very little about her. She comes briefly into the records, in an incredibly obscure way ‚Äì she‚Äôs in the archives of the county of Chester.\\" Jane married William Hough ( ‚Äì 1585), of Leighton in Wirrall, Cheshire, around 1550. William Hough was the son of Richard Hough (1505 ‚Äì 1573/4) who was employed by Thomas Cromwell from 1534 to 1540 as his agent in Chester. It is unknown what role Thomas and Gregory Cromwell played in her life. However, it would be safe to say that, after her marriage, Jane did not share her father's religious beliefs. Jane and her husband William Hough were staunch Catholics who, together with their daughter, Alice, her husband, William Whitmore and their children, all came to the attention of the authorities as recusant Catholics in the reign of Elizabeth I. Gregory Cromwell came to share his father's interests and religious beliefs and was closely following the religious developments taking place in England while his father was in office. Gregory's close friends, William Cecil and Ralph Sadler, were known adherents of the reformed faith. A letter written to Gregory by Henry Dowes in March 1540 reveals that he was deeply concerned about the recantation of the vicar of Stepney, William Jerome. In his report to his former pupil, Dowes noted that \\"your comaundemente hath fully persuaded me you to be nott a litle desyrous to receyve knowledge after what sorte he behaved himselfe, aswell concernyng his Recantation, as also the reste of thinges conteyned in his saide Sermon.\\" After the deaths of his wife and daughters, Thomas Cromwell was devoted to his son, Gregory, and his sister Catherine's son, Richard Williams (alias Cromwell) and they were a close family. One of Richard's letters to his uncle bemoaned their separation from one another. He wrote that \\"I never more desired anything, than since your departure, to see you, nor thought time longer in your absence.\\" Gregory was equally effusive in a letter where he asked only for his father's blessing, which he described as \\"more treasure unto me then all the abundance of worldly goods.\\" Gregory remained close to his father and looked up to his older cousin, Richard Cromwell, who had distinguished himself by his military skill and gallantry. By the autumn of 1529, he had adopted the name Cromwell. Richard must have been fond of his cousin, Gregory, leaving him \\"a great horse\\" in his will. Education > Be sure you shall have in him a wise quick piece Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of > Norfolk The original medieval dining hall of Pembroke College, Cambridge, since demolished and rebuiltThomas Cromwell ensured his son received the best possible education at Cambridge with a number of carefully selected tutors,A number of letters survive from Gregory Cromwell to his father and others from his tutors that provide details of the boy's education while at Cambridge and at the homes of his supervisors and mentors: Gregory Cromwell: Margaret Vernon: John Chekyng: John Hunt: Henry Lockwood: Henry Dowes: often sending gifts to Gregory and his older companions, Nicholas Sadler and cousins, Christopher Wellyfed and another known only as Beresford, who were educated with him. Gregory was at Cambridge from 1528 to 1533. During his education, he resided in Pembroke Hall and Christ's College and at the homes of his father's friends and colleagues. It has been incorrectly asserted by early historians such as J. S. Brewer and R. B. Merriman and assumed by later historians like B.W. Beckingsale and David Loades that Gregory Cromwell was fourteen or fifteen when he was being educated at Cambridge in 1528 and therefore born around 1514. This has led to negative speculation about the boy's character and abilities which can be disproved. Gregory was, in fact, beginning his education and not undertaking a degree at the end of his education. He did not obtain a degree at Cambridge. That would have been unusual for a gentleman's son at that time, unless he had been destined for a career in the church. Sir Henry Ellis stated that \\"The date of Gregory Cromwell's birth is not recorded, but it could hardly have been earlier than 1520.\\" It appears that Henry Ellis was right and that Gregory Cromwell was a small boy in 1528, no more than eight years old. Letters from Gregory's supervisors, tutors and mentors during his education point to a year of birth of around 1520. As evidence that Gregory was very young in 1528, there are two letters written by John Chekyng, his tutor, to Thomas Cromwell, describing a little boy who plays and who is learning to read and write. The first letter, written in July 1528, states that his son Gregory \\"is not now at Cambridge, but in the country, where he works and plays alternately ... He is now studying the things most conducive to the reading of authors, and spends the rest of the day in forming letters.\\" A second letter from Chekyng, written in November 1528, notes that \\"Little Gregory is becoming great in letters.\\" Sir Richard Southwell, portrait by Holbein Another letter to Thomas Cromwell, which can be dated to between September 1529 and Whitsuntide 1530, written by Margaret Vernon provides further proof of Gregory's young age. Vernon wrote \\"You promised that I should have the governance of the child till he was 12 years old. By that time he shall speak for himself if any wrong be offered him, for as yet he cannot, except by my maintenance.\\" After the death of his mother, Gregory was placed in the care of his father's friend, Margaret Vernon, Prioress of Little Marlow, in Buckinghamshire. At that time it was not unusual for gentlemen to place their young children in the care of nuns. As a rule the boys in nunneries were very young as it was not considered appropriate for them to stay with the nuns later than their ninth or tenth year. The nuns were permitted to educate only the girls. It was acceptable for young boys, up to the age of nine or ten, to be supervised by nuns, but not taught by them, and so they were usually accompanied by a male tutor. Margaret Vernon wrote to Cromwell in 1528 stating that \\"Your son and his master are in good health, and now prosper in learning more in one day than before in a week, by reason of Nich. Saddelar, who is of very good conditions. Mr. Copland every morning gives each of them a laten, the which Nicholas doth bear away, as well Gregory's lesson as his own, and maketh the same Gregory perfect against his time of rendering. The master takes such comfort that he is with them three times a day.\\" Gregory's older companion, Nicholas Sadler, may have been a younger brother or perhaps a cousinAs Ralph Sadler was born in 1507, Nicholas could not have been his son. of Sir Ralph Sadler, Thomas Cromwell's personal secretary and close friend. Nicholas Sadler also had with him a \\"little gentlewoman\\", who Margaret wished permission to educate herself, to fill up her leisure intervals. While Gregory was at Cambridge, his tutors Included: * John Chekyng ‚Äì Fellow of Pembroke Hall, sophister, chosen 1519, reader of divinity, 1534. * Henry Lockwood ‚Äì Master of Christ's College, 1531‚Äì1548. * John Hunt, (1514‚Äì1586) ‚Äì Graduate of Cardinal College, Oxford, lawyer. Gregory was later placed under the care and supervision of his father's friends and allies, * Rowland Lee, (died 1543) ‚Äì Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry. English Bishop. Educated at Cambridge, he received preferment under the patronage of Cardinal Wolsey, who employed him in the suppression of the monasteries (1528 ‚Äì 29). He was greatly esteemed by Henry VIII and is believed to have performed the ceremony of Henry's marriage to Anne Boleyn (1533). He was one of the first bishops to take the oath of supremacy recognizing Henry as Head of the Church. * Sir Richard Southwell, (1504‚Äì1564) ‚Äì Privy Councilor. Early in 1535, for some period, Gregory lived with Southwell in Woodrising Manor in Norfolk, :and * Henry Dowes, (1501 ‚Äì 1550) ‚Äì the son of a wealthy Maldon merchant, who was mentor to Gregory Cromwell for several years. He supervised his pupil's tuition in Latin, French and other subjects. Dowes appears to have kept up his relationship with Gregory Cromwell after ceasing to be his mentor. In March 1540 he sent Gregory a detailed report of a sermon preached by the vicar of Stepney, William Jerome, which had included ‚Äòopprobrious words against the burgesses of the Parliament as calling them butterflies, dissemblers and knaves‚Äô. Gregory Cromwell received dedications to three humanist works: Voluzenus's version of Cicero's Dream of Scipio; David Clapham's translation of Agrippa's Commendation of Matrimony and Sir Richard Morrison's translation of Vives' Introduction to Wisdom. In 1540, Sir Richard Morrison ( ‚Äì 1556), an English humanist scholar and diplomat who was a prot√©g√© of Thomas Cromwell, propagandist for Henry VIII, and then ambassador to the German court of Charles V for Edward VI, dedicated his translation of Introductio ad sapientiam by Juan Luis Vives to Gregory Cromwell. Juan Luis Vives, by an unknown artist Vives' devotional work, The Introduction to Wisdom, a companion piece to the Instruction, was translated into English by Sir Richard Morison in 1540 and dedicated to the son of Thomas Cromwell. The translator is lavish in his praise of Vives: \\"This boke was gathered by Ludovicus Vives, a man greatly conversant in all good authours and excellentlye wel sene in all kindes of lerning.\\" Vives' manual was extremely popular in the English schools, used as a textbook in the Tudor schools together with Lily's Grammar.\\" Juan Luis Vives (1493‚Äì1540) was a Spanish humanist and educational theorist, who strongly opposed scholasticism and made his mark as one of the most influential advocates of humanistic learning in the early sixteenth century. His works are not limited to education but deal with a wide range of subjects including philosophy, psychology, politics, social reform and religion. Thomas Cromwell, influenced by the humanist view of preparation for the active life, took great pains with his son's education, although the boy's studies were not always conducted along humanist lines. Cromwell approved a curriculum including the study of the works of Erasmus, English and ancient history, music, and exercise with arms for Gregory. He provided for his son, the sort of education which Sir Thomas Elyot was advocating for the ruling class. In a letter to Thomas Cromwell, Henry Dowes, Gregory's preceptor, details how his son studied French, Latin, English, accounting, music and Roman and Greek history. He practised the longbow, played the lute and virginals and shared his father's love of hunting, hawking and riding. Gregory and his cousin, Christopher Wellyfed were permitted to indulge their love of hunting during breaks in their studies. Gregory promised his father that he would do his best at all times ... although he needed a little encouragement! On the whole, Gregory's tutors seemed to be happy with his progress. In November 1528, John Chekyng advised his father that \\"Little Gregory is becoming great in letters.\\" Margaret Vernon noted in 1529, that Gregory \\"is in good health, and is a very good scholar, and can construe his paternoster and creed. When you next come to me I doubt not that you shall like him very well.\\" At that time, young children practised reading from religious texts, the primer, containing the Paternoster, Ave Maria, Creed and other common prayers and liturgical works like the antiphonal and the psalter. In the case of boys, the learning of Latin grammar also involved religious material. An elementary exercise might take the form of studying and analysing the basic prayers in their Latin forms, as Gregory is mentioned by Vernon, learning to translate the Paternoster and the Creed from Latin. The lure of the countryside could prove a distraction to an active boy, who needed to be pulled back into line. Henry Dowes wrote to Cromwell in September 1534 explaining that he had used every effort to advance Gregory in his studies, but ‚Äúforcause summer was spent in the service of the wild gods, it is so much to be regarded after what fashion youth is brought up.‚Äù However, by April 1535, Dowes was able to report to his father that \\"his improvement is greater than at any time here before, partly because he is brought into some awe and dread, and is ready to give himself to learning when required, partly because those things which formerly alienated his mind from study are now withdrawn.\\" Gregory excelled in athletic pursuits. Dowes reported to Cromwell in September 1535, that his son \\"for his recreation he useth to hawke and hunte, and shote in his long bowe, which frameth and succedeth so well with hime that he semeth to be therunto given by nature.\\" Towards the end of Gregory's education, the boy was to become an asset to his father and a help to his mentor, Rowland Lee, Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, in Ludlow. The bishop had written to Cromwell on 19 January 1536 to ask for assistance, now that he had to \\"learn a new school, to play with pen and counters, for the King's grace's money.\\" Believing that it would be difficult for him without some help, he asked Cromwell to \\"please send me my lover Mr. Gregory, for though the thieves have hanged me in imagination, I trust to be even with them shortly.\\" During his time in Wales, Rowland Lee came to be known as the \\"hanging bishop\\" for the harsh measures taken in an attempt to curb widespread lawlessness. One man, in particular, was impressed by the young man. Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, reported to Cromwell in August 1536 that his son was in good health and, \\"sparing no horseflesh to run after the deer and hounds. I trust you will not be discontent that I now cause him to forbear his book. Be sure you shall have in him a wise quick piece.\\" It would appear that Gregory Cromwell, and John More, the son of Thomas More, have been wrongly assumed to have been unintelligent, simply because they happened to be overshadowed by their extraordinary fathers. It is evident that Cromwell's son was a capable scholar, who besides mastering Latin, French and accounting, had learned to play the lute and virginals and excelled in the outdoor pursuits of riding, hunting with the longbow and hawking. He was athletic and therefore had much in common with his older cousin, the courtier Richard Cromwell. It is apparent that Gregory Cromwell was an intelligent, well-educated and accomplished young man who must have been a source of pride to his father. Gregory had received an extensive education to prepare him for adult life. Now that his education was complete, he was ready to marry and begin a career in his father's service. Marriage and issue Elizabeth Seymour, c.1535‚Äì1540, Hans Holbein the Younger In March 1537 Elizabeth, Lady Ughtred had written to Thomas Cromwell from York to seek his favour in acquiring one of the soon-to-be dissolved monasteries. Aged about 19, she was the widow of Sir Anthony Ughtred, who had died in 1534: a younger daughter of Sir John Seymour, sister of Queen Jane Seymour and the future Protector Somerset. The opportunity was not lost on Cromwell and he proposed instead that she marry his son and heir, Gregory. By June it appears that Cromwell's offer had been accepted, although Gregory had not been her only suitor. Sir Arthur Darcy had written to her on 15 June, regretting his loss: \\"If I do tarry here in the country, I would have been glad to have had you likewise, but sure it is, as I said, that some southern lord shall make you forget the North.\\" The couple were married on 3 August 1537 at Mortlake. Historian Derek Wilson has observed that in marrying his son Gregory to the then queen's younger sister, Thomas Cromwell became \\"related by marriage to the king, an event well worth recording for posterity by a portrait of his daughter-in-law.\\" A portrait by Hans Holbein dated circa 1535‚Äì1540 exhibited at the Toledo Museum of Art as Portrait of a Lady, Probably a Member of the Cromwell Family (1926.57), once thought to be Queen Catherine Howard, may instead depict the wife of Gregory Cromwell. The lady is wearing a French hood, her sleeves are said to follow a style set by Anne of Cleves and she has wonderful blackwork decorating her cuffs. Born in around 1518, Elizabeth was probably in her 21st year in 1539 or 1540 and about the right age to be the sitter. The portrait may have been commissioned by Thomas Cromwell between January 1540 and early June 1540 when Anne of Cleves was queen consort and before his arrest. It is also possible that a portrait of Gregory was painted at the same time and has not survived. It appears that Elizabeth had two children from her marriage to Ughtred. Sir Richard Southwell wrote to Thomas Cromwell in August 1537 that he had seen \\"a child of my lady your daughter's at Wylberffosse nunnery, Yorksh., who was in good health at the writing of this.\\" As the writer refers to my lady your daughter, he could only be referring to Cromwell's new daughter-in-law, Lady Ughtred, and the child was in Yorkshire, where she had been living in the years since her marriage. This child may have been Henry Ughtred, born around 1533, in Jersey, or Margery Ughtred of Kexby, Yorkshire, who married William Hungate of Burnby, Yorkshire. Elizabeth assured her new father-in-law that \\"which doth comfort me most in the world, that I find your lordship is contented with me, and that you will be my good lord and father the which, I trust, never to deserve other, but rather to give cause for the continuance of the same\\". It is unknown whether it was Thomas Cromwell or Edward Seymour who suggested the match, but the marriage appears to have been happy and Elizabeth's brother and father-in-law were certainly on friendly terms. Edward Seymour, then Viscount Beauchamp, wrote to Cromwell on 2 September 1537 to know how he has fared since the writer's departure. Wishes Cromwell were with him, when he should have had the best sport with bow, hounds, and hawks and sends commendations to his brother-in-law and sister, adding \\"and I pray God to send me by them shortly a nephew.\\" Gregory and Elizabeth had five children: * Henry Cromwell, 2nd Baron Cromwell, (1538 ‚Äì 1592), Gregory and Elizabeth had two \\"little boys\\" by December 1539. Henry would have been born in 1538 and Edward in 1539. married before 1560, Mary Paulet, daughter of John Paulet, 2nd Marquess of Winchester. The couple had three children: :* Edward Cromwell, 3rd Baron Cromwell, ( ‚Äì 27 April 1607), married first Elizabeth Upton (died 1592/3), of Puslinch, Devon, and then Frances Rugge (died 1631) of Felmingham, Norfolk, by whom he had a son, Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Ardglass and two daughters, Frances and Anne. :* Sir Gregory Cromwell, married Frances, daughter of Sir Edward Griffin of Dingley, Northamptonshire. :* Katharine Cromwell (d. 24 March 1621), married on 10 February 1581 at North Elmham, Norfolk, Sir Lionel Tollemache, 1st Baronet, of Helmingham, Suffolk (before 14 December 1562 ‚Äì 1612), son of Sir Lionel Tollemache and Susan Jermyn. They had a son, Sir Lionel Tollemache, 2nd Baronet. * Edward Cromwell (1539 ‚Äì bef. 1553.) * Thomas Cromwell, ( ‚Äì died between February 1610 and April 1611), educated at St John's College, Cambridge.William Cecil, in the robes of the garter Married, August 1580, Katherine (died 1615/1616), daughter of Thomas Gardner of Coxford, 5 sons, 4 daughters. : :He was an English Member of Parliament during the reign of Elizabeth I. His diaries of proceedings in the House of Commons are an important source for historians of parliamentary history during the period when he was a member, and Sir John Neale draws heavily upon them in his groundbreaking study of Elizabeth I and Her Parliaments, vol. I (1559‚Äì1581), 1953, vol. II ( 1584‚Äì1601), 1957. :Sir William Cecil (later Lord Burghley), whom his father called in his will \\"my especial and singular good lord\\", may have found him his seats at Fowey, Bodmin and Grampound, possibly by arrangement with the end Earl of Bedford at Fowey and Bodmin. :His return at Preston in 1584 is accounted for by the patronage of Sir Ralph Sadler, chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who was brought up in the household of Cromwell‚Äôs grandfather, Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex. Neale has described Thomas Cromwell as \\"the model type of parliamentarian, deeply versed in the history and procedure of the institution, though lacking in historical perspective; eminently responsible, but fearless in defence of liberty.\\" He was a puritan, but his zeal did not cloud his judgment, which, with his knowledge of procedure, rendered him one of the most experienced committeemen of his time. He served on nearly 100 committees, and wrote journals covering the sessions of Parliament in 1572, 1576, 1581 and 1584, now in the library of Trinity College, Dublin. * Katherine Cromwell, (‚Äì ) wife of John Strode of Parnham, Dorset, son of Robert Strode and Elizabeth Hody, had six sons * Frances Cromwell, ( ‚Äì 7 February 1562) on 11 November 1560 at Compton, Hampshire, married Richard Strode of Newnham, Devon, son of William III Strode (1512‚Äì1579) by his wife Elizabeth Courtenay, daughter and heiress of Philip Courtenay of Loughtor, a younger son of Sir Philip Courtenay (died 1488) of Molland in North Devon. They had one son, William Strode (died 1637), MP. Death of Queen Jane Presumably, Gregory was still in his father's service, and he and his wife were living in one of Thomas Cromwell's many houses after the marriage, however, there is no mention of Gregory and Elizabeth in the records until the death of Queen Jane on 24 October 1537, less than three months after their wedding. On 12 November they took part in the late queen's funeral procession. Gregory and his cousin, Richard Cromwell carried banners; their wives were among the principal mourners. Her sister's death was not only a personal tragedy for Elizabeth, but it was to have long-term repercussions for the Cromwells, particularly for Thomas Cromwell, that could never have been foreseen. Career and public life, 1537‚Äì1539 After his marriage, Gregory continued his training in his father's service. During his career, he held several offices, including: * Justice of the Peace, Sussex, 1538 * Ranger, Rutland Forest, 1545 * Commissioner, Musters, Leicestershire, 1546 * Commissioner, Relief, 1550 * various other commissions 1539‚Äì1551 Lewes The couple's first child, Henry, was baptised 1 March 1538, probably at Hampton Court, where the Lady Mary almost certainly stood godmother. Shortly after the baptism, Gregory and his wife left for Lewes in Sussex, arriving with a large retinue at the former Cluniac Priory of St Pancras, recently acquired by Thomas Cromwell. While in Sussex, Gregory became a justice of the peace, which was his first official position. The site and possessions of the Priory of St Pancras, Lewes were granted to Thomas Cromwell and his heirs, on 16 February 1538. Their extent was considerable. The demolition of the monastery began without delay, however the Priory HouseThe Priory House at Lewes, which afterwards obtained the name of \\"The Lord's Place,\\" was destroyed by fire in the seventeenth century. It lay a short distance to the south-east of the present Church of Southover. was not demolished and was reserved as a place of residence for the new owner. In a letter to his father in April, Gregory Cromwell gives the details of his arrival, and of the warm reception and presents given to him and his wife, by the families of the neighbourhood. However, the rats of Lewes had presents of their own, and in May, plague had broken out in the town. The couple left Lewes and hastily retreated to another of Thomas Cromwell's houses called \\"The Motte\\" about four miles away from the town. In late June, the king was expected to come to Lewes in his Progress. Gregory Cromwell wrote to his father to inform him that the plague had not completely abated in the town. Gregory and his wife were to leave Sussex in 1539, and their household at Lewes was disbanded. Leeds Castle Leeds Castle After the appointment of Thomas Cromwell as Constable of Leeds Castle, Kent, in January 1539, his son Gregory and his wife moved into the castle. Gregory and his wife lived mainly at Leeds Castle at Thomas Cromwell's expense from their arrival until his arrest in June 1540. Living there qualified Gregory for election as one of the knights of the shire for Kent to the Parliament of that year. His partner, the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, Sir Thomas Cheyne, presumably ensuring his return at the request of his father. It is notable that Gregory Cromwell was under the age of majority of twenty-one. His election is to be seen as one move in Thomas Cromwell's campaign to ensure a \\"tractable\\" Parliament. Welcoming Anne of Cleves at Calais Anne of Cleves, miniature by Holbein Gregory was summoned to Parliament on 28 April 1539. In December 1539, during its second prorogation, he travelled to Calais to welcome Anne of Cleves. Gregory wrote several letters to his father at this time, detailing the difficulties of the crossing from Dover to Calais (a twelve-hour journey), reporting that many of the gentlemen with him were \\"extremely vexed with sickness\\" and assuring his father that he and the Lord Admiral were not among them. More than likely, this was his first time on board a ship and away from the English mainland. He describes his impressions at the first sight of Calais, how he has seen the castle and the blockhouses and other fortresses and recounts the delights of the feasting, entertainments and jousting while waiting for Henry VIII's new bride. Gregory also wrote to his wife from Calais, addressing her as his \\"loving bedfellow\\", describing the arrival of Anne of Cleves, and requesting news \\"as well of yourself as also my little boys, of whose increase and towardness be you assured I am not a little desirous to be advertised.\\" The Admiral and his entourage spent about nine days in Calais before the arrival of Anne of Cleves, passing the time, in part, with tournaments and other amusements. Anne of Cleves arrived on Thursday 11 December. \\"She arrived within the English pale at Calais between 7 and 8 a.m., and was received by the lord Deputy, the Lieutenant of the Castle, the Knight Porter, and the Marshal of Calais, Sir George Carow, Captain of Resbanke, and the Captain of the Spears, well appointed with great horses, and with them the men of arms, in velvet coats and gold chains, and all the archers in the King's livery well appointed; ‚Äúand so brought her towards Calais, a gentleman of arms of the King's and another of hers riding together.\\" Within a mile of Calais, she was received by the earl of Southampton, Lord Admiral, with the lord William Howard, Sir Francis Brian, the lord Grey of Wilton, the lord Hastings, lord Clifford, lord Herbert, lord Tailbush, Sir Thomas Seymour, Sir Henry Knyvett, Mr. Gregory Cromwell, with ‚Äúxxiiij‚Äù gentlemen in coats of satin damask and velvet, besides the said lords, who wore three collars of cloth of gold and purple velvet and chains of gold, and 200 yeomen, &c.;, in the King's colours, red and blue cloth. ‚ÄúThen the King's ships off Newland as she came by them let 200 shots of guns,‚Äù after which the town of Calais shot 300 pieces of ordnance. When she came to the Lantern Gate, she stayed and viewed the king's ships, the Lion and the Sweepstake, decked with 100 banners of silk and gold, wherein were 200 master gunners and mariners and 31 trumpets, ‚Äúand a double drum that was never seen in England before‚Äù; and so her Grace entered into Calais. At her entry, 150 pieces of ordnance let out of the said two ships made such a smoke that one of her train could not see another. ‚ÄúWhere stood in order on both sides the streets, like a lane, with 500 soldiers in the King's livery of the retinue of Calais, and the mayor of Calais with his brethren, and the commons of Calais, and the merchants of the Staple, stood in like manner in array, and made a lane wherethrough she passed to her lodging.‚Äù There the mayor and his brethren came to her and gave her 50 sovereigns of gold, and the mayor of the Staple, 60. Next morning ‚Äúshe had a gun shot, justing and all other royalty that could be devised in the King's garrison;‚Äù and kept open household there for the 15 days that she remained.\\" The Admiral had been instructed by Henry VIII to \\"cheer my lady and her train so they think the time short\\". Anne knew little English, so, with the assistance of an interpreter, he taught her to play \\"Sent\\" and other card games that the king enjoyed, with Gregory Cromwell taking part. The journey to England was planned for Friday afternoon; however, the weather proved so rough that it was futile to think of crossing at that time. The Lord Admiral entertained Anne of Cleves on the Saturday by showing her the ship prepared for her passage, with the other ships in the harbour, gaily decorated and with men on the tops, shrouds, and yard-arms. Guns were shot off in her honour, and after a banquet there was jousting. The high winds and rough seas continued until Saturday the 27th, when the weather was favourable for the crossing and Anne of Cleves finally arrived in England, landing at Deal, in Kent. The Great London Muster, 1539 In 1539, in response to the potential threat of invasion by his Roman Catholic enemies, Charles V and Francis I, Henry VIII prepared for the worst by fortifying the coasts and fitting out his navy, and ordered a muster of all his male subjects, aged from sixteen to sixty. The Lord Mayor of London ordered a general muster of the citizens to be held at Mile End on Thursday, 8 May. It was a formidable display of the king's power ‚Äì three divisions, each of five thousand men and their attendants marched through the city to the Palace of Westminster, where the King stood in his gatehouse, to see them as they passed by. The size of the muster was estimated, by the Lord Chancellor, Thomas Audley, to have been about sixteen and a half thousand men. Thomas Cromwell played his part, sending a great number of men and weapons among the citizens of London. They were led by a veritable forest of pike-men, bowmen and gunners in the thousands, and followed by weaponry drawn on carts, moving through the city to parade past Henry VIII at Westminster. Cromwell's son and heir, Gregory and his nephew, Richard Cromwell rode with muster, together with Sir Christofer Norris, Master of the Ordinance, \\"and other of the Kinges servantes.\\" They followed \\"the end of the last battell, rydinge on goodly horses and well apparayled.\\" The Fall of Thomas Cromwell, 1540 1540 was to be a year of triumphs and tears for the Cromwell family. In January, Elizabeth was appointed to the household of the new Queen, Anne of Cleves. In March, during a virtual witch-hunt against 'heretical' preachers by Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, Gregory Cromwell requested Henry Dowes to write a letter detailing the recantation of William Jerome, Vicar of Stepney. This was significant, as Stepney was Thomas Cromwell's church, where he and his family worshipped. Gardiner was firing a warning shot in his rival's direction. Still rising in royal favour, Thomas Cromwell was created Earl of Essex on 17 April, and his son, Gregory assumed the courtesy title of Lord Cromwell (from his father's secondary title of Baron Cromwell, of Wimbledon in the County of Surrey). The arms granted to Gregory Cromwell were four coats, quarterly; 1st, quarterly, per fess indented, azure, and or, four lions passant, counterchanged; 2nd, per fess, or and gules, on a pale between two lis, azure, and two pelicans of the first, a pelican and lis, all counterchanged; 3rd, azure, on a fess, between three lions rampant, a rose, gules, between two Cornish choughs; 4th, Prior, as before, and the motto, \\"Faire mon devoir\\". On 18 April, Thomas Cromwell was made Great Chamberlain. The May Day Jousts, 1540 In May 1540, Gregory, now Lord Cromwell, After his father's creation as Earl of Essex in April, Gregory assumed the courtesy title of Lord Cromwell, from his father's secondary title of Baron Cromwell (of Wimbledon in the County of Surrey). and his cousin Richard Cromwell took part in the May Day Jousts which were held at the Palace of Westminster. The jousts began on Saturday, 1 May, and lasted for a week. The jousts had been announced in France, Flanders, Scotland and Spain for all who would compete against the challengers of England. The challengers included Sir John Dudley, Sir Thomas Seymour, Sir Thomas Poyninge, Sir George Carew, Anthony Kingston, and Richard Cromwell. The challengers entered the lists that day richly dressed, their horses trapped in white velvet, with knights and gentlemen riding ahead of them, dressed in white velvet and white sarcenet, and all their servants in white sarcenet doublets and hose, in the Burgundian fashion. To joust against them, forty-six defendants entered, led by the Henry, Earl of Surrey, including Lord William Hayward, Lord Edward Clinton, Lord Gregory Cromwell, and others, who were all richly dressed. After the jousting had ended the challengers rode to Durham Place, which was lavishly decorated, with great cupboards of plate on display and where they kept open household during the tournament. Delicious foods and drinks were plentiful and minstrels played continually. Elaborate feasts and suppers were provided there, which were attended by the King, the Queen and her ladies, all the court, and all other comers. The guests \\"were served every meal with their own servants after the manner of war, their drum warning all the officers of household against every meal.\\" On the second day of the jousts, Mr. Anthony Kingston and Richard Cromwell were made knights. Richard Cromwell so impressed the king with his valour, that he was given a diamond ring from the king's own finger. A Gathering storm The wave of success was to be short-lived for Thomas Cromwell. Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, a traditionalist conservative, was determined to destroy his arch-enemy, Cromwell, by accusing him of supporting heretical preachers, thereby undoing his programme of religious reforms. At the same time, Cromwell's political rival and religious conservative, Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, who had pushed hard for the Act of Six Articles to be passed in Parliament, was rising in favour and fast becoming a threat. The Act of Six Articles, which reaffirmed certain Catholic principles in Henry VIII's Church of England, had been passed in May 1539. Henry VIII had now drawn a line in the sand on religious reform and Cromwell found himself in an untenable position with regards to his reformist policies. French Ambassador, Charles de Marillac noted \\"the division among this King's ministers, who are trying to destroy each other.\\" Cromwell's party seemed to have the upper hand, however the situation was about to take a turn for the worse. Catherine Howard, The Windsor version of the Holbein miniature Cromwell was safe only as long as he retained royal favour. However, the king had found his new wife Anne of Cleves particularly unappealing and as she was no longer of any political use he wanted a divorce. Cromwell realised that a divorce would result in a massive loss of face for him as the promoter of the marriage and its associated political machinations and that it could lead not only to his ruin, but also to the end of the Reformation in England. He made the fatal mistake of hesitating when the king asked him to look to a solution to end the marriage. Taking advantage of the king's marital discontent and Thomas Cromwell's hesitation over the divorce, Gardiner and the Norfolk together came up with a plan to bring down the Earl of Essex. Norfolk used his pretty young niece, Catherine Howard, at court, to distract the king; and while Henry VIII was distracted, he and Gardiner plotted their rival's demise. Stephen Gardiner entertained the king and the girl in his episcopal palace, while their agents were searching for any damning evidence that could be used against Cromwell. Feeling threatened, after the arrest of Bishop Sampson of Chichester, Gardiner and Norfolk decided to make a preemptive strike. \\"Cromwell was accused of the sacramentarian heresy, or denial of the real presence. The charge with its overtones of anabaptism and anarchy, temporarily overbalanced Henry\\" and with the deposition by Wriothesley that implied Cromwell was stalling over the divorce, the king was persuaded to order Cromwell's arrest. Henry was made to see his chief minister as an obstacle to Anne's removal and replacement by Catherine. Gardiner was more than happy to provide the king with the means to a speedy divorce and \\"false knaves\\", Richard Rich and Michael Throgmorton were easily procured to make further allegations to the king about the Earl of Essex.\\" Arrest Thomas Cromwell was arrested suddenly at a council meeting at 3.00 p.m. on the afternoon of 10 June 1540, on trumped up charges of treason and heresy, taken to the Tower and his possessions seized. The French Ambassador Charles de Marillac described his arrest in the Council Chamber at Westminster. Palace of Westminster in the time of Henry VIII As soon as the Captain of the Guard declared his charge to make him prisoner, Cromwell in a rage cast his bonnet on the ground, saying to the duke of Norfolk and others of the Privy Council assembled there that this was the reward of his services, and that he appealed to their consciences as to whether he was a traitor; but since he was treated thus he renounced all pardon, as he had never thought to have offended, and only asked the King not to make him languish long. Thereupon some said he was a traitor, others that he should be judged according to the laws he had made, which were so sanguinary that often words spoken inadvertently with good intention had been constituted high treason. The duke of Norfolk having reproached him with some ‚Äúvillennyes‚Äù done by him, snatched off the order of St George which he bore on his neck, and the Admiral, to show himself as great an enemy in adversity as he had been thought a friend in prosperity, untied the Garter. Then, by a door which opens upon the water, he was put in a boat and taken to the Tower without the people of this town suspecting it until they saw all the King's archers under Mr. Cheyney at the door of the prisoner's house, where they made an inventory of his goods. According to the sixteenth century chronicler Edward Hall, those who genuinely mourned Cromwell's arrest were far outnumbered by those who rejoiced. Cromwell, who was courageous enough to implement radical changes in an inherently conservative society like England, was by no means a popular man. Marillac, reporting the news of Cromwell's arrest to Francis I, wrote that \\"considering that public affairs thereby entirely change their course, especially as regards the innovations in religion of which Cromwell was principal author, the news seems of such importance that it ought to be written forthwith\\" and in another letter to Montmorency noted \\"the division among this King's ministers, who are trying to destroy each other. Cromwell's party seemed the strongest lately by the taking of the dean of the Chapel, bp. of Chichester, but it seems quite overthrown by the taking of the said lord Cromwell, who was chief of his band, and there remain only on his side the abp. of Canterbury, who dare not open his mouth, and the lord Admiral, who has long learnt to bend to all winds, and they have for open enemies the duke of Norfolk and the others. The thing is the more marvellous as it was unexpected by everyone.\\" Gregory would have been nearby, in the House of Commons, at Westminster, when his father was arrested and must have hastily sent word to his wife Elizabeth, who was at court attending Queen Anne. He and his wife found themselves in a very vulnerable position, and were faced with the possibility of their own arrest. Having been dependents of Thomas Cromwell, they found themselves homeless‚Äîall Cromwell's houses, lands, money, and goods were seized by the king (Leeds Castle was soon in the hands of Sir Anthony St Leger)‚Äîand, no doubt, in dire financial straits. It is highly probable that Elizabeth's brother, Edward Seymour, then Earl of Hertford, interceded with the king on the couple's behalf, gave them advice, and provided them with a place to live, and that Sir Ralph Sadler was secretly sending news to Gregory about his father. Gregory's marriage to Elizabeth‚Äîthe sister of the late Queen Jane and his connection to Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford, now a favourite of the Henry VIII‚Äîmay have afforded him a degree of protection from the king's wrath. There is no record of Gregory or his wife being questioned in relation to Thomas Cromwell's arrest. Prisoner in the Tower View of London - The Tower of London circa 1554-57 drawing by Anton van den Wyngaerde The case against Thomas Cromwell was weak; it was well known that Cromwell favoured religious reform, though he had not proceeded any further with his programme of reforms than the king would allow, and his every act had been authorised by the king. Cromwell had not broken any laws, contravened any statutes or disobeyed any royal proclamations. Therefore, he was condemned without a trial and his sentence was later confirmed by an act of attainder. There are no surviving records of Gregory and Elizabeth's movements at this time. From the day of Thomas Cromwell's arrest until 16 June, during which time he was formally questioned by Norfolk and Thomas Audeley, he gave written answers to questions and wrote detailed letters at the king's command, there was still a faint hope of a reprieve. However, on 17 June, the bill of attainder was heard in Parliament for the first time and Cromwell would have known his terrible fate. Ominously, on a deposition to the king, he wrote \\"All these articles be tr[ue by the] death I shall die, and m[ore] as more plainly app[eareth by a] letter written with my [own hand] sent by Mr. Secretary [unto] the King's Highness.\\" Thomas Cromwell wrote a desperate letter from the tower to the king to plead his innocence and appeal to him to be merciful to his son and the rest of his family. > \\"Sir, upon [my kne]es I most humbly beseech your most gracious Majesty [to > be goo]d and gracious lord to my poor son, the good and virtu[ous lady his] > wife, and their poor children\\" According to John Foxe, Ralph Sadler alone dared to carry to the King his letter pleading for mercy. From this Letter we learn that Henry VIII sent Cromwell money while in the Tower and it appears to have given him more than a hope of life. Moreover, Thomas Cromwell was granted the extraordinary 'privilege' of being told of the charges against him and who his accusers were. When Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk was himself arrested in 1546, he \\"prayed the lords to intercede with the king, that his accusers might be brought face to face, to say what they had against him ; and he did not doubt but it should appear he was falsely accused. He desired to have no more favour than Cromwell had, he himself being present when Cromwell was examined.\\" He added that Cromwell \\"desired, if he might not see his accusers, that he might at least know what the matters were ; and if he did not answer truly to every point, he desired not to live an hour longer. He had always been pursued by great enemies about the king ; so that his fidelity was tried like gold.\\" On 29 June, the act of attainder was passed in both houses of parliament and Thomas Cromwell's fate was sealed. It is not known whether Gregory Cromwell was present in the House of Commons during the proceedings against his father. In July 1540, fearing for her family's future security, Elizabeth wrote the following letter of submission to Henry VIII: > \\"After the bounden duty of my most humble submission unto your excellent > majesty, whereas it hath pleased the same, of your mere mercy and infinite > goodness, notwithstanding the heinous trespasses and most grievous offences > of my father-in-law, yet so graciously to extend your benign pity towards my > poor husband and me, as the extreme indigence and poverty wherewith my said > father-in-law's most detestable offences hath oppressed us, is thereby right > much holpen and relieved, like as I have of long time been right desirous > presently as well to render most humble thanks, as also to desire > continuance of the same your highness' most benign goodness. So, considering > your grace's most high and weighty affairs at this present, fear of > molesting or being troublesome unto your highness hath disuaded me as yet > otherwise to sue unto your grace than alonely by these my most humble > letters, until your grace's said affairs shall be partly overpast. Most > humbly beseeching your majesty in the mean season mercifully to accept this > my most obedient suit, and to extend your accustomed pity and gracious > goodness towards my said poor husband and me, who never hath, nor, God > willing, never shall offend your majesty, but continually pray for the > prosperous estate of the same long time to remain and continue.\\" This undated letter is placed at the end of July 1540 in Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII. It is possible that it was written while Thomas Cromwell was imprisoned in the Tower, as Elizabeth refers to her father-in- law, and not her late father-in-law. Moreover, it was customary at that time to write \\"may his soul God pardon\\" or something similar when referring to someone who had recently died, which she did not do. The letter may have been written on the advice of her brother or at the king's command. The king was inclined to be generous and Elizabeth was to be included in the future Queen Catherine Howard's household as one of her attendant ladies. Richard Hilles, a merchant, wrote in a letter dated 28 February 1541, \\"some think it was a like artifice in the King to confer his title and many of his domains while he was yet in prison upon his son Gregory, who was almost a fool, in order that he might the more readily confess his offences at execution.\\" There is absolutely no evidence that Gregory was a fool, and much to prove that he was intelligent and accomplished. Moreover, Gregory Cromwell was not created Baron Cromwell by letters patent until December 1540 and did not receive any royal grants before February 1541. His courtesy title of Lord Cromwell was forfeit after his father's arrest, although he did continue to receive the profits from the property alienated to his use and his heirs by his father in November 1538. This property included the manors and lordships of Oakham and Langham (Rutland), Clapthorne, Hackleton and Piddington (Northamptonshire), and Blaston (Leicestershire), with the advowson of Blaston church, and the manors of North Elmham and Beetley (Norfolk). Gregory was still receiving the profits from Langham in April 1541, his entitlement was then being questioned and which was later resolved in his favour. Hilles' comments can be dismissed as unsubstantiated gossip, although there is always the possibility that the mercurial Henry VIII promised Cromwell, while he was in the Tower, to be a \\"good and gracious lord\\" to his son. Death of Thomas Cromwell Cromwell's letter had moved the king, who had asked for it to be read to him three times. However, it was not enough to save his life. Thomas Cromwell was beheaded on Tower Hill on 28 July 1540. Since Thomas was attainted, Gregory could not succeed his father as Earl of Essex and Baron Cromwell (of Wimbledon in the County of Surrey). The Church of St Peter ad Vincula inside the Tower of LondonGregory and Elizabeth were not implicated, although it took many months before their desperate situation was to be resolved. Their lives were still in danger from an increasingly paranoid king. It is unknown if Gregory and his family were present at Thomas Cromwell's execution or if permission was given by the king to bury his beloved father with dignity, as Sir Thomas More's family had, under the floor in the Chapel of St Peter ad Vincula in the Tower. Among those who genuinely mourned Thomas Cromwell, beside Gregory and his family, were his prot√©g√©s and close friends: Sir Ralph Sadler had lived in Cromwell's household as a boy, was educated by him and had known Gregory Cromwell since he was born. Thomas Cromwell was godfather to Sadler's first two sons. It was Sadler who managed to acquire Holbein's portrait of Thomas Cromwell and keep it hidden during the remaining years of the reign of Henry VIII. Sir Richard Cromwell, his nephew, went about in open mourning after his uncle's disgrace and execution, a very brave thing to do at the court of Henry VIII. The poet Sir Thomas Wyatt penned an eloquent lamentation of his personal loss. The verse speaks of a man who was not only his patron, but his friend, and confidant. > The pillar perish'd is whereto I leant, > The strongest stay of my unquiet mind; > The like of it no man again can find, > From east to west still seeking though he went, > To mine unhap. For hap away hath rent > Of all my joy the very bark and rind: > And I, alas, by chance am thus assign'd > Daily to mourn, till death do it relent. > But since that thus it is by destiny, > What can I more but have a woful heart; > My pen in plaint, my voice in careful cry, > My mind in woe, my body full of smart; > And I myself, myself always to hate, > Till dreadful death do ease my doleful state. > > Sir Thomas Wyatt Aftermath At the time of his arrest in 1540, Thomas Cromwell was one of the wealthiest landowners in England. This was \\"the end result of an active decade buying and selling lands, augmented by large monastic and other royal grants.\\" Gregory as his sole heir should have inherited a vast fortune. Instead, over the next few years his father's lands and property were distributed by the king to others. Gregory Cromwell, his wife and their children faced an uncertain future. For several months after Thomas Cromwell's execution, Henry VIII remained convinced of his late chief minister's guilt and anyone who had been closely associated with the late Earl of Essex was regarded with suspicion and closely watched. Tensions within the court were running high. Matters came to a head on the evening of 17 January 1541, when Ambassadors Eustace Chapuys and Charles de Marillac reported to their masters that Sir Thomas Wyatt, Sir Ralph Sadler and unnamed others had been arrested. The following morning, they were taken from Hampton Court, with their hands bound, and accompanied by 24 archers, to the Tower. Marillac wrote to Montmorency that Thomas Wyatt \\"was led to the Tower so bound and fettered that one must think ill, for the custom is to lead them to prison free\\" noting that it \\"must be some great matter for he has for enemies all who leagued against Cromwell, whose minion he was.\\" Sir Ralph Sadler was able to clear himself and was released in a few days. Sir Thomas Wyatt was set free the following March, at the request of Queen Catherine Howard. Sadler must have provided some very persuasive evidence to his interrogators in the Tower, sufficient not only to secure his own release, but enough to convince the king to question his late chief minister's fate. The French ambassador, Marillac was to write to Montmorency on 3 March 1541 that Henry VIII had reproached his ministers for Cromwell's death, \\"saying that, upon light pretexts, by false accusations, they made him put to death the most faithful servant he ever had.\\" It appears that Henry VIII no longer considered Thomas Cromwell to have been guilty of the charges against him, that he had been misled by his councillors and now regretted the loss of an able minister. Peerage and knighthood On 18 December 1540, less than five months after his father's execution, Gregory Cromwell was created Baron Cromwell by letters patent, and summoned to Parliament as a peer of the realm. This title was a new creation, Baron Creation: let. pat. 18 December 1540 Territorial designation: None Extinct: 26 November 1687 rather than a restoration of his father's forfeited barony. Baron Creation: let. pat. 9 July 1536 Territorial designation: Wimbledon Earl of Essex Creation: let. pat. 17 April 1540 All titles Extinct: 29 June 1540 Thomas Cromwell was attainted on 29 June 1540 and all his titles forfeited The arms he adopted were: quarterly, per fess, indented, azure and or, four lions passant counterchanged and his motto, \\"Faire mon devoir\\". He was now Lord Cromwell, 1st Baron Cromwell in his own right. When Thomas Cromwell was created Earl of Essex on 17 April 1540, his son, Gregory had assumed the courtesy title of Lord Cromwell from his father's secondary title, Lord Cromwell, 1st Baron Cromwell (of Wimbledon in the County of Surrey). Gregory Cromwell was never created Baron Cromwell (of Wimbledon in the County of Surrey) in his own right and only held the courtesy title for a few weeks until his father's arrest and subsequent attainder, when the title was forfeited. The Great Hall of Oakham Castle Henry VIII granted Oakham to Thomas Cromwell in July 1538 under the old title of the castle, lordship and manor, yet the grant seems to have referred only to the manor of Oakham with certain judicial rights in the soke and not to the dependent manors and fees of the barony. In November 1538 the manor was settled on Gregory and his wife Elizabeth, to hold for their lives, with remainder to their son, Henry. In this way it escaped forfeiture at the time of Thomas Cromwell's attainder and execution, and was held by his descendants. The following February Gregory received a royal grant of lands that had been owned by his late father. The grant included the house and site of the former priory of Launde, in Launde and Loddington, Leicestershire and lands specified in Loddington, Tilton on the Hill, and Launde as well as \\"lands enclosed within the said site, called 'Whadborowgh' or 'Wateborogh', belonging to the late monastery of St. James near Northampton\\", and a water-mill in Launde, the manor of Loddington, parcel of the possessions of the said late priory and also the rectory and advowson of the vicarage of Loddington. Launde Abbey in Leicestershire was to become the main family estate. It is a manor house built on the site of an Augustinian Priory founded in 1119. Thomas Cromwell had bought Launde Abbey for ¬£1500 but did not live to take up residence. Gregory completed the building of the manor house on the site of the priory and lived there with his family from 1541 until his death in 1551. Gregory Cromwell was appointed Knight of the Order of the Bath at the coronation of King Edward VI, on 20 February 1547. Later years Gregory Cromwell managed to avoid the pitfalls of the Tudor nobility. He did not participate in court politics and for the last ten years of his life he combined managing his estates and shire administration with attendance in the House of Lords where he had an excellent attendance record. Man aged 24, perhaps Gregory Cromwell (- 1551), 1543, Hans Holbein the Younger. He remained close to his cousin, Sir Richard Cromwell, his former preceptor Henry Dowes, Sir Ralph Sadler and William Cecil, who had been one of the Duke of Somerset's personal secretaries and Master of Requests in the Duke's household. Sir Richard Cromwell died only four years after Thomas Cromwell. Gregory Cromwell had become a very wealthy man, having accumulated vast amounts of land, in addition to the land given to him by his father in 1538, through several royal grants. In 1541, Gregory received a grant of property in Leicestershire and Northamptonshire of the \\"house and site, &c.;, of the late priory of Launde, in Launde and Lodyngton, Leic., and lands specified in Lodyngton, Tylton, and Launde; also lands enclosed within the said site, called \\"Whadborowgh\\" or \\"Wateborogh,\\" belonging to the late monastery of St. James near Northampton, a water-mill in Launde, and the manor of Lodyngton, parcel of the possessions of the said late priory; also the rectory and advowson of the vicarage of Lodyngton.\\" In Rutland, Gregory held the castle and the Manor of Oakham, the Manor of Langham, two windmills, three other mills, sixty messuages, twenty cottages with their appurtenances in Oakham, Langham and Flitteris, of the King in Capite, by Knights Service in Fee. Also the Manor of Lyddington, and land belonging to the late chantry at Manton, with their appurtenances in Lyddington, Belton and Wardley, Stoke Dry, and Snelston, with the advowson of Wardley, of the King, by the rent of 14l 3 s 5 d ob. per annum for all services as appeared by Letters Patents granted by Edward VI. This last mentioned estate was for the lives of himself and Elizabeth his wife. In addition, from 1538, he owned the manors of Clapthorne, Piddington and Hackleton in Northamptonshire as well as the manors of North Elmham and Beetley in Norfolk,and from 1545, held the lease of a moiety of the manor of Rompney in the lordship of Newport, South Wales in survivorship (formerly granted to his father.) Though not very long, Gregory Cromwell's life was eventful. He lived through the last turbulent years of Henry VIII's reign, saw his queens and courtiers come and go, he survived the execution of his father, witnessed epidemics of plague and sweating sickness take away his friends and relations and lived through much political, social and religious upheaval. Although his exemption from attending the king in the war in France in 1544 might suggest illness or injury, he appears to have made a full recovery. During his time in the House of Lords, he participated in several high-profile proceedings, notably the attainders of Catherine Howard on 8 February 1542, as well as Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey and Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, in January 1547. In 1547 he participated in the funeral of Henry VIII, as one of the lords carrying the canopy over the late king's coffin. On 28 February 1549 he was present in the House of Lords when the bill of attainder was passed on his wife's brother Thomas Seymour and again in January 1550 during proceedings against his brother-in-law and patron Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset. Death and succession Launde Abbey Chapel Gregory Cromwell died of sweating sickness on 4 July 1551 at his home, Launde Abbey, Leicestershire, and on 7 July 1551 was buried in a magnificent tomb in the chapel there. His wife was also ill but survived. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Henry. Henry's grandson, Thomas, 4th Baron Cromwell, later 1st Viscount Lecale, was created Earl of Ardglass in the Irish peerage on 15 April 1645. The Barony of Cromwell was held by the 1st Viscount Lecale from 22 November 1624 and by the Earls of Ardglass from 15 April 1645 until 26 November 1687, when, on the death of Vere Essex Cromwell, 4th Earl of Ardglass and 7th Baron Cromwell, both titles became extinct., by Sylvanus Urban, Gent. Lady Cromwell subsequently married, between 10 March and 24 April 1554, Sir John Paulet, later Lord St. John, eldest son of Sir William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester. She died 19 March 1568, and was buried 5 April in St Mary's Church, Basing, Hampshire. In culture Gregory Cromwell was played by actor Jack West in the Season 3 finale of Showtime cable television show The Tudors. In Wolf Hall, a novel by Hilary Mantel, which offers a sympathetic portrayal of the rise of Thomas Cromwell, Gregory is depicted as a childlike, slightly inept but lovable young man. In Bring Up the Bodies, Mantel's acclaimed sequel to Wolf Hall, the portrayal is of a young man coming of age with confidence - still naive, but with potential; he is played in the BBC television adaptation by Tom Holland. In the stage production of Wolf Hall Part Two, Gregory (played by Benedict Hastings) is an intelligent young man who understands why his father must be sometimes ruthless but is still young enough to be horrified by his father's actions, especially in the disposal of Anne Boleyn's \\"lovers\\".

She and her sister \\"Queen\\" Ann Bassett are known for their love affairs and associations with well-known outlaws, particularly Butch Cassidy's \\"Wild Bunch\\". Early life Josie Bassett was born the first of two girls to Herb Bassett and Mary Eliza Chamberlain (Elizabeth) Bassett in Arkansas on January 17, 1874. When she was still a young girl, her parents moved to a ranch spanning the borders of Utah, Wyoming and Colorado. She and her sister were taught to rope, ride, and shoot at a young age. Both girls were sent to prominent boarding schools in their youth, but both chose to return to the ranching life by their teen years. Herb Bassett was well known to many of the famous outlaws of the day as he did business with them often, supplying them with beef and fresh horses. Among those who visited the Bassett ranch were \\"Black Jack\\" Ketchum, Butch Cassidy, Elzy Lay, Kid Curry, Will \\"News\\" Carver and Ben Kilpatrick. With these notable outlaws coming often to the ranch, both Ann and Josie were first exposed to outlaws. Association with outlaws Josie and Ann were good looking young women, and both had a wild side. By 1893, Ann Bassett was involved romantically with Butch Cassidy, and Josie was involved with Elzy Lay, Cassidy's closest friend. When Cassidy was sent to prison for 18 months, starting in 1894, Ann became involved in a relationship with Ben Kilpatrick. By the time Cassidy was released, Will \\"News\\" Carver had become involved with Josie, who ended their relationship when Carver became involved with female outlaw Laura Bullion. Josie in turn became involved with Cassidy until Cassidy again became involved with Ann. That was the complicated circle of relationships that developed between the Bassett girls and Cassidy's Wild Bunch gang. Despite the seemingly constant changes in romantic companions by both the Bassett girls and the gang members, there is no indication that any animosity ever resulted from it. Josie Bassett was reportedly one of only five women who were allowed into the outlaw hideout called \\"Robbers Roost\\", located in Utah; the others were her sister Ann, the Sundance Kid's girlfriend Etta Place, Elzy Lay's wife Maude Davis, and Will \\"News\\" Carver's girl Laura Bullion. Those outlaw relationships, as well as the Bassett ranch's supply of beef and horses to the gang, assisted the sisters in their time of need. In 1896, several powerful and wealthy cattlemen approached the Bassetts to sell their ranch. When the sisters refused, the cattlemen's association began hiring cowboys to harass the sisters, stampeding their cattle and rustling. The sisters in turn began to rustle cattle from the cattlemen. Although the cattlemen's association dispatched cowboys to harass the sisters and intimidate them into selling, the cowboys rarely followed through with the acts for fear of retribution from the outlaws with whom the sisters were known to associate. One legend indicates that Kid Curry, easily the most feared of the Wild Bunch gang, approached several of the cowboys known to work for the cattlemen and warned them to leave the Bassetts alone. That story cannot be confirmed, but what is certain is that by 1899, the sisters were receiving very little pressure to sell. After the outlaw days As time passed, the Wild Bunch gang eventually faded. By 1904, most of the gang members closest to the Bassett girls had either been killed or captured. Josie's former lover, Wild Bunch gang member Elzy Lay, reportedly visited Ann and Josie at the ranch shortly after his release from prison in 1906 before he moved to California, where he lived the remainder of his life as a respectable businessman. Although Cassidy is reported to have been killed in Bolivia, Josie claimed that he visited her in 1930 and lived in Utah until the late 1940s. Josie Bassett lived most of her life on her father's property, operating the ranch and leading a mostly outdoor life, with camping, fishing and hunting as her primary hobbies. She married five times over the course of her lifetime. She divorced four of her husbands, allegedly running one off with a frying pan. A fifth husband died, reportedly of alcoholism, but rumors persist that Josie poisoned him. With one husband, Carl McKnight, Bassett had two sons: Crawford McKnight and Herbert \\"Chick\\" McKnight. In 1913, she moved to a homestead near Vernal, Utah, and made a new ranch there her lifetime commitment. In 1924, Crawford helped her build a new cabin on this property. During the Great Depression, she supplied food to others in the area, particularly with supplies of beef. She made her own soap, sewed her own clothing, and became known for her prowess at hunting deer, which she often did for her own family and for neighbors. In one instance, a game warden stopped by her cabin announcing that he was there to arrest her for poaching. She confessed that she had just killed a deer and took him to the carcass. The game warden was joking with her and took no action. During the Prohibition years, Josie made and sold bootlegged whiskey but she never was arrested. Years after Prohibition, she continued to make her own brandy and whiskey until she was finally warned that revenue agents were looking for her still. In 1936, rancher and former adversary Jim Robinson accused her of butchering his cattle and selling the meat in town. Six other ranchers joined in on the accusations. Hides from the carcasses were found on her property. Bassett was arrested. She claimed the evidence was planted. Several neighbors supplied her with bail money until her trial. She was tried twice, each ending in a hung jury. After the second trial, the local prosecutor dropped the charges. In 1945, she fell victim to a land scheme and lost most of her land. However, she lived frugally in her cabin and supported herself well into her 80s. In later life, she became an eccentric and talked often with neighbors about the wild days and her associations with outlaws. In December 1963, she fell when a horse knocked her down, breaking her hip. She died a few months later at the age of 90. She was the last remaining associate of the Wild Bunch gang as well as the last direct source of information about its members, their personalities, and traits.

Polypodium aureum, Polypodium leucotomos) is an epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. Other common names include calaguala (Spanish language), laua\`e haole (Hawaiian),Starr, F. and K. Starr. Phlebodium aureum. Plants of Hawaii. Starr Environmental. samambaia (Portuguese), and hartassbr√§ken (Swedish). Description Leaves It is a rhizomatous fern, with the creeping rhizome 8‚Äì15 mm (rarely 30 mm) in diameter, densely covered in the golden-brown scales that give the species its name. The fronds are large and pinnatifid (deeply lobed), from 30‚Äì130 cm long and 10‚Äì50 cm broad, with up to 35 pinnae; they vary in color from bright green to glaucous green and have undulate margins. Several round sori run along each side of the pinna midrib, and the minute spores are wind-dispersed. The fronds are evergreen in areas with year-round rainfall, semi-evergreen or briefly deciduous in areas with a marked dry season. Distribution It is confined to the eastern side of the continents, extending north into the United States to Florida and the extreme southeast of Georgia, and south through the Caribbean (the Bahamas, Puerto Rico, and Lesser Antilles), and northern and eastern South America to Paraguay. It is the only species of Phlebodium found in North America, the other species all confined to South America. Habitat This fern is rarely terrestrial in habitat, usually colonizing the canopies of tropical rainforests and the dwarf palms of subtropical forests. It is common in the cloud forests of the Caribbean and northern South America. It grows in varied habitats in Florida, including swamps and hammocks, and can thus apparently tolerate a wide range of microclimates. Its restriction to the tropics and subtropics is readily explained by its intolerance of anything other than very brief, light frosts. High levels of light are also critical for the growth of this species, and its deciduous habit allows it to invade relatively dry areas. Cultivation and uses Spores Phlebodium aureum is well-adapted to cultivation and is valued both as an ornamental plant and in herbal medicine. It can be cultivated in greenhouses in non-tropical climates if night temperatures do not fall below about 5 ¬∞C. Several cultivars have been selected for garden planting, with varying leaf color from grey-green to silver-green to blue-green, or with cristate or very wavy frond margins. Medicine Decoctions have been used as a panacea in Central American folk medicine. These tonics were prescribed for a multitude of ailments, ranging from asthma to heart disease. Modern medicine has also investigated P. aureum, often using the deprecated synonym Polypodium leucotomos. Oral consumption of Polypodium leucotomos extract has also been studied for the treatment of dermatologic disorders including melasma, vitiligo, psoriasis, polymorphous light eruption, atopic dermatitis, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, photoaging and skin cancer. Oral consumption of Polypodium leucotomos extract has been shown to protect the skin from ultraviolet light damage. Clinical studies have shown that Polypodium leucotomos extract provides photoprotection against the effects of both UVB and UVA light. A review of 19 human and 6 basic scientific studies showed that Polypodium leucotomos was well tolerated with a favorable side effect profile. Consequently, Polypodium leucotomos supplementation has been posited as an adjunct photoprotection strategy in combination with traditional UV filters, such as sunscreen. Systematics Phlebodium aureum is a member of a very small, and recently discovered genus. It was split from the genus Polypodium, and the split is still apparent in the multitude of synonyms available for Phlebodium aureum. Phlebodium is one of the 178 genera in the family Polypodiaceae. Additionally, the family Polypodiaceae is broken into a number of subfamilies, with Phlebodium a member of the non-grammatid tribe within the subfamily Polypodioideae. Members of the non-grammatids in this subfamily include the genera Phlebodium as well as Polypodium, from which Phlebodium is derived and which most likely is its closest relative. Other members include Pecluma, Pleopeltis, Microgramma, and Pleurosoriopsis. A bootstrapping technique proves that, at a 90% confidence level, the polypodiaceous ferns form a sister relationship with tree ferns. However, further phylogenetic studies need to be conducted regarding the current status of the genus, and which of the species are the most related. The genus Phlebodium is exemplified by containing rows of areoles that lack included veins, and each sorus served by two different veins. Correll and Correll, two authors responsible for thirty years of classification since Flora was introduced in 1982, documented Phlebodium aureum as Polypodium aureum as recently as 1982. However, this creation of the new genera is warranted based on some notable differences. For instance, Giudice et al. points out that the sori on Phlebodium are more smooth and rounded when compared to other groups within the family Polypodiaceae. Additionally, studies on spores and size of the mature plant prove that Phlebodium contrasts severely from the rest of its family, providing the creation of the genera. The division of genera within the Polypodiaceae is fairly gray, considering that systematically, gametophytes differ only very slightly amongst different genera. Members of the family Polypodiaceae are most closely related to the Davalliaceae, with further relationships noted to Oleandraceae, Tectariaceae, and the Lomariopsidaceae within the order Polypodiales, which contains 80% of today‚Äôs ferns species (see additional page for picture). The order arose and diversified about 100 million years ago, and are regarded as one of the most evolutionarily advanced orders of ferns.

The helicopters are owned and operated by the charity, which raises money from public donations in excess of ¬£9million every year. History DAAT was formed by Ann Thomas, in memory of her son, 18-year-old Ceri Thomas, who was fatally injured in a road traffic collision in 1986. At hospital, his mother learned that the quicker a patient receives hospital treatment, the greater that patient's chances of survival. Subsequently, she started a campaign to launch an air ambulance service for Devon. The service went into operation on 27 August 1992, covering the entirety of the county of Devon, including the rural and inaccessible moors of Exmoor and Dartmoor. The charity currently operates two helicopters, and can reach 50 per cent of locations in Devon within fiveminutes of taking to the air, with remaining locations accessible within 20minutes. Organisation Exeter-based EC135 helicopter G-DAAN Great Torrington-based H145 helicopter G-DAAS The charity owns and operates two Eurocopter EC135 helicopters, from two different airfields, to maximise coverage of the county. Both helicopters fly for ten hours a day, seven days a week. From late autumn 2016, the Exeter- based helicopter flew into the hours of darkness, up to midnight, into one of a network of community night-landing sites created across the county. The Exeter-based EC135 P2+ helicopter, registered G-DAAN, is located along with the National Police Air Service helicopter at Exeter Airport. The previous aircraft was purchased in 2008 for around ¬£3.3M. The North Devon-based EC135 P2+ helicopter, registered G-DVAA, is located at Eaglescott Airfield, previously at Belle Vue Airfield, near Great Torrington. In 2019, the charity announced that it would be replacing G-DVAA with a newly built Airbus H145. Registered G-DAAS, it was delivered to DAAT in June 2020. In 2020, the charity introduced two Volvo XC90 Critical Care Cars, which allow the service to be delivered when helicopters are unable to fly. Role The charity's mission statement is: \\"To relieve sickness and injury in and around the county of Devon through provision of an emergency Air Ambulance service\\". The charity provides air ambulance cover for the entire county, in association with the South Western Ambulance Service, who provide the paramedics on secondment. The charity receives no funding from the government, nor the National Lottery, relying on public and businesses donations, plus income generated by its shops and society lottery helps to meet annual running costs. In 2019, the charity raised ¬£9.1M, of which ¬£5.9M was used to operate the two air ambulances. Notable donations Both of the helicopters bear the signature of television presenter and patron Jennie Bond, who named the charity as her choice during her appearance in the show I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!. The money raised enabled the charity to buy a GPS moving map system for the first helicopter. BBC Radio Devon also ran a two-year appeal which raised the final ¬£850,000 needed to buy a second owned aircraft (G-DAAN).

In 1764 he became one of Russia's candidates for the Polish-Lithuanian throne. When Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski was chosen instead, he was made Palatine of Vilnius. He later joined the anti-Russian Bar Confederation. Defeated by the Russian forces under Alexander Suvorov in the Battle of Sto≈Çowicze, he was forced into exile. However, in 1768 he was allowed to return and was nominated to the rank of the Grand Hetman of Lithuania, thus becoming one of two highest-ranking military commanders in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian state. During the Great Sejm of 1788-1791, Ogi≈Ñski was a member of the Patriotic Party. However, following the defeat of his faction in the Polish‚ÄìRussian War of 1792, he resigned his post and retired to his family manor in S≈Çonim. Apart from his political and military career, he was a noted engineer and musician. He helped to establish the Pi≈Ñsk‚ÄìVolhynia road, the arsenal in Vilnius, and the Oginski Canal, which joined the watersheds of the Neman and Dnieper rivers (1765-1784). He also founded numerous factories and foundries in the lands belonging to his family. He was also a noted musician and composer, as well as a benefactor of artists. At his court in S≈Çonim he held two theater groups (Italian and Polish), a printing house and orchestra. He also modified the design of the harp and wrote several musical compositions. He was among two Polish scholars (alongside Jan Szczepan Kurdwanowski) who contributed to the French Encyclop√©die.

It is a motte-and-bailey castle and was later replaced by the much larger, stone-built Rhuddlan Castle. The only remaining visible signs of the old castle are the large mound of the motte, and traces of the wall that surrounded the bailey. History Reconstruction of Twthill Castle in the 11th century Twthill castle was built to a 'motte and bailey' design and was erected by Robert of Rhuddlan in 1073. He was a kinsman of Hugh d'Avranches, Earl of Chester and the castle was designed to consolidate Norman advances into the north of Wales at the command of William the Conqueror. Using this castle as a base, Robert subdued the Welsh and established control of much of North Wales. A borough became established beside the castle and by 1086, eighteen burgesses enjoying special privileges lived here, and the buildings included a church and a mint. Coins minted at Rhuddlan between this date and 1215 can be found in museum collections. The motte and bailey castle remained in use for two hundred years until Rhuddlan Castle was built adjacent to the site, on the orders of Edward I. Tradition has it that Twthill Castle was built on the site of the palace of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, king of Wales. Preservation Twthill is located some 300 yards south of the later, stone-built Rhuddlan Castle. Only the motte mound of the old castle remains today, standing 12 metres high with a maximum diameter of 80 metres, although impressions of the bailey can be seen in the surrounding fields. Much of the site has degraded due to the sandy soil conditions./ Twthill is currently in the care of Cadw and is open to the public all year round.

Katenin Pavel Aleksandrovich Katenin () (22 December 1792 ‚Äî 4 June 1853) was a Russian classicist poet, dramatist, and literary critic who also contributed to the evolution of Russian Romanticism. Katenin took part in the Patriotic War of 1812 and was one of the leaders of the Military Society, which preceded the Decembrists. In 1820, his freethinking attitudes led to his being dismissed from the army. Two years later, Count Miloradovich, Governor of St. Petersburg, had him deported from the capital for having booed his own favourite actress. Katenin was an avid theatre-goer who spurned Shakespeare as vulgar and obscure and admired Corneille and Racine for their noble diction and clarity. His enthusiasm for Neoclassical theatre induced him to translate a number of French tragedies for the Russian stage. He also wrote Andromache (1809‚Äì19), the last \\"regular\\" Russian tragedy. The actor and playwright Vasily Karatygin was considered his disciple. Katenin's principal contention was that poetry should be national, and it was this which led him away from the Karamzinians and Zhukovskyites. Disappointed by Zhukovsky's mellifluent translation of B√ºrger's Lenore, Katenin brought out his own version of the ballad, whose title was Russified as Olga (1816). In this poem he tried to attain nationality by the use of aggressive (and at that time objectionable) realism in diction and detail.Olga was later praised by Pushkin as showing the energetic beauty of B√ºrger's original creation. The great poet deplored the fact that \\"this simplicity and crudity of expression, this scum which replaced the ethereal chain of shadows, these gallows in place of rural scenes illumined by the summer moon, struck unaccustomed readers unpleasantly\\". He instigated a dispute over the proper method of translating ottava rima, a dispute which resulted in Pushkin's poem The Little House in Kolomna. Katenin's early ballads had an appreciable influence on the Russian ballads of Pushkin, who esteemed Katenin highly and was almost alone in doing justice to his poetry. In his later work Katenin became excessively archaic, finally breaking away from the taste of the day. In all he did he was a genuine master of technique but he lacked the creative fire that alone infects and attracts. After 1832 he abandoned literature and lived in the seclusion of his estate near Kologriv, a profoundly embittered and dissatisfied man. Notes References * S. Bertenson. P. A. Katenin.

He is the only writer to win the Townsend Prize for Fiction twice. His poetry is featured regularly in publications such as Harpers, The Georgia Review, The Chattahoochee Review, The Gettysburg Review, and Southern Poetry Review. In 2002, Mitcham began teaching writing workshops as a part-time professor at Mercer University. He also directed the Summer Writers' Institute at Emory University. Life and Career Judson Cofield Mitcham was born in 1948 in Monroe, Georgia to Wilson Mitcham, who worked at the local mill, and Myrtle, who worked for the New Deal Seed Loan Program. When he was 16, Judson Mitcham was involved in a car accident while driving a Chevrolet Corvair, which caused the death of one of his friends. Thinking about this incident was among the things that fueled Mitcham to write. Mitcham studied psychology at University of Georgia, receiving his Ph.D. at 1974. He taught psychology at Fort Valley State University until his retirement in 2004. In interviews, Mitcham has stated he had not written poetry in a serious way until he was 30. He originally wanted to write songs, but realized that his lyrical skills were a lot better than his music skills. His first published poetry collection, Somewhere in Ecclesiastes, won him both the Devins Award and the Georgia Author of the Year. His first novel, The Sweet Everlasting, won the Townsend Prize for Fiction. Mitcham stated that he wrote \\"narrative poems\\", and thus switching from poetry to fiction was a natural one. His poems and novels are set in Georgia, and the themes of his works include family, loss, age, and spirituality. In 2012, Georgia's Governor Nathan Deal named him the state's Poet Laureate. As Poet Laureate, he initiated Poet Laureate's Prize, awarded annually to an original poem written by a Georgia high school student. In 2013, Mitcham was inducted into Georgia Writers Hall of Fame. He resides in Macon with his wife. He has two children and three grandchildren.

Biography Dover began playing guitar when he was 11 years old. He started playing around town wherever he could. He shared the stage with Kim Boyce and was in the group The Extras with drummer Scott Collier in the mid-1980s. The core of that band split off to form the outfit Love Bang in 1991. They were signed to a development deal by Ardent Studios in Memphis and recorded for them for the next two years. Love Bang's album, The Rule of 72's, was released March 26, 2009 and is available on iTunes. In 1993 he joined Jellyfish on tour after the release of Spilt Milk. The group disbanded in 1994 and Dover joined bandmate Roger Manning in the group Doverman. Dover and Manning have cameos as part of Davy Jones' band in the 1995 The Brady Bunch Movie. Before Doverman went into the studio, Dover auditioned as lead vocalist for the first solo album by Slash of Guns N' Roses. Dover recorded vocals on the Slash's Snakepit album It's Five O'Clock Somewhere before rejoining Manning in the renamed Imperial Drag. After Imperial Drag broke up in 1997, Dover appeared on several albums as a session musician before joining Alice Cooper's band for the Brutal Planet tour in 2001. He played on 2001's Dragontown and is co-credited with Alice Cooper and fellow guitarist Ryan Roxie on most of the tracks of the 2003 album The Eyes of Alice Cooper. He left the band following the tour for The Eyes of Alice Cooper. Fellow Birminghamian Damon Johnson won the audition to replace him. Dover went on to frequently appear with other members of Cooper's band as Glamnation. Currently, Dover fronts a group named Sextus and has adopted a moniker of the same name. The debut album Stranger Than Fiction was released by Sextus on March 18, 2008 on Dramapants Records. The second record Devil Angel was released in October 2010. The lineup of Sextus is made of Eric Dover (Vocals and guitar), Chris Declercq (Guitar), Joe Karnes (Bass), Eric \\"Icky\\" Skodis (Drums), Mitchell Sigman (Keyboards) and Ron Dziubla (Saxophone). Dover is also a member of the rock outfit The Lickerish Quartet alongside former Jellyfish members Roger Joseph Manning Jr. and Tim Smith. Dover is currently living in Los Angeles.
