Its Latitude is 31° 41' 28.08\\"N, and Longitude is 73° 0' 59.49\\"E. The people of Talib use M3 to commute as it is 140 kilometers away from Lahore and 30 kilometers away from Faisalabad. Nearby towns are Chak Jhumra, Chiniot, Sargodha, Lalian, Bhawana, Rabwah (Chenab Nagar), Faisalabad and Pindi Bhattian. By road, Talib is connected to Barnala, Chak Jhumra, and Chiniot. The most famous things in Talib are Darbar Baba gard Ali, Canal Bridge, Government Primary school for Boys Girls and Government Middle school for girls. Before 1947 Mouza Talib' was inhabited by two young men from the Khokhar clan during Raja Ranjit Singh's rule over Punjab, they got married in a nearby locality and the population rose in the following years. Before the independence of Pakistan in 1947 era when India was a British colony Hindu Khatri were also living in the village and most of them were land lords with control over business and agriculture, and their terms with the Muslim community were not good, for instance, Muslims had to slaughter cows or bulls on their marriages by ensuring Hindus were out of sight to avoid any possible fight. Independence of 1947 On 14–15 August 1947, Pakistan and India came into being respectively. Those Hindu Khatris migrated to India, leaving behind their property both (residential and agricultural) and it went into the hands of local Muslims, mainly Khokha's and Harals. The Government of Pakistan asked them to leave this village in advance for the migrants they were expecting to pound in from India, and offered them to possess a newly allocated village, Khichian, near Brnala, but they declined to do so and consequently had to leave agricultural lands for the migrants, mainly Gujjars and Arain. By this time the previous offer by the Government for a new village also lapsed. So the locals once again became dependent. After 1947 The immigrants and locals could not be adjusted on the go and developed some sort of enmity because of clashes in customs, language and wealth level, but the locals went on working hard in the later years, while others mainly Gujjars were enjoying the pleasures of life; this slowly but steadily changed the ultimate uphold of lands in favour of locals. Castes This village consists of four major families * Khokhar * Gujjar, * Haral, and * Arain other supporting castes include * Kumar * Nai * Tarkhan * Muslim Shaikh * Lohar * Machi * Awan * Aasi * Changur * Miraci * Badher * Tarrar Facilities This multi-ethnic population numbers near 7000 and much of this population is illiterate, and conditions of public facilities are poor. A Civil hospital exists three kilometers away from the main population area. Water sanitation and drainage are the burning issues these days. Economy The economy is meager and agricultural mostly. Some people are Government employees. A canal from Jhang Branch passes through the village. Irrigation water for land comes from this canal, also the land is very fertile.

He writes and performs songs in a style close to the tradition of French chanson but in the English language. His main influences are Belgian singer-songwriter Jacques Brel and English singer-songwriter and poet Jake Thackray. Musical beginnings After growing up in Somerset, East Sussex and London, Philip moved to the south of France for six months to paint. There he was introduced to the songs of Jacques Brel which inspired him to start writing songs himself. Back in England, he was taught to sing by his mother, who had trained as an opera singer at the Royal Academy of Music, started playing a guitar and then changed his name to Philip Jeays, after his maternal great-great-grandfather. Early performances His first performance in 1985 at Hampton Wick Folk Club was well received. Due to nerves he didn't perform again until 1989 when he took part in an acoustic and poetry club night in Clapham, London. He releases his first recordings on cassette in 1990 and starts performing with guitarist Max Warner. This set up allowed him to 'perform' the songs more without the restraints of a holding a guitar. After a near fatal car crash in 1992 he recovers and continues to perform around various small clubs in London. The band In 1995, he teamed up with guitarist and bass player William George Q and pianist David Harrod. The trio first performed at the Vortex Jazz Club in Stoke Newington and then at various London venues. He is spotted by singer-songwriter Tom Robinson who offers him a support slot at the Borderline in June 1996. Over the next few years he performs at the Edinburgh Festival, Vancouver International Comedy Festival and also on various radio networks. Guitarist John Peacock replaces William George Q, and the trio is joined by drummer Jezza Campbell. Recordings Philip releases his first CD 'October' on his own Ditton Pye label. He also contributes to two Radio 4 programmes 'Singing in the Wilderness' (presented by Tom Robinson and 'Chanson' presented by Kit Hesketh-Harvey. He continues to record and release albums 'Cupid Is A Drunkard' (2000), 'The Ballad Of Ruben Garcia' (2002), 'Fame' (2003) and 'Mr Jeays' (2005) while performing at various venues around London, Sussex and occasional trips up to Leeds, Hull and Manchester. He usually either performs solo or with a group of musicians from Brighton that include Paul Stapleton, Kerry Stapleton and Simon Goble. Battersea Barge Since the early 2000s he has staged The Jeays Christmas Extravaganza at the Battersea Barge, London. This has continued to be a popular annual event among Jeays fans and features Phil performing with David Harrod, Jezza Campbell, John Peacock, William George Q and, more recently, Kerry Stapleton on double bass. The setlist for the Christmas shows is made up of requests from the audience who are given a raffle ticket at the door. Before each song Philip will pick out and read a raffle ticket number and take a song request from the ticket holder. The show is usually hosted by poet Geoff The Speech Painter who performs a support slot at the start of the evening. John Peacock has also performed a short set as support. Besides the Christmas shows, Philip and the band have also performed album launch shows around the time of each CD release. In the last two years, the band have performed more regularly at the venue featuring various support acts. Supporting Robin Ince In 2006, Phil was invited to perform as part of 'Robin Ince Loves Books' shows at the Bloomsbury Theatre and The Albany in London. He performed as support on Robin Ince's 'Bleeding Heart Liberal' tour of the UK in 2009 and also on Robin's Nine Lessons and Carols for Godless People shows at the Bloomsbury Theatre and Hammersmith Apollo. More recently Phil performed at Robin Ince and Brian Cox's 'End of the World Show' at the Hammersmith Apollo in December 2012.

He was the Senior Editor of al-Doha Cultural Magazine from May 2011 until September 2013. The City of Pleasure A city like no other, guarded by the goddess of pleasure and, ruled by a licentious king who dedicated his time to carnal pleasures and a princess who dreams of love and tender empathy. The priests decide to design the walls of the princess's room with figures of embracing lovers and burnt incense and chanted their magical incantations that the pictures on the wall may come to life and the dream of the princess for true love might come true. People real and shadowy, strong slaves and emperors have met their doom at the gates of the City of Pleasure. Eventually the gates of the impenetrable city succumbs under the charm of two ingenious commodities: fried potatoes and pepsi-cola. No one knows the real history of the City of Pleasure and no welcome visitor has ever escaped its enchantment. This is the novel that has been structured from human myths melted down and recreated one of the most perfectly executed literary whims.

Service history  Following a shakedown cruise to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, during April and May 1945, John P. Gray arrived at New London on 1 June 1945 to escort the Italian submarine Ris Mameli to Guantanamo Bay. From there John P. Gray proceeded via the Panama Canal Zone to San Diego, California, arriving 19 June 1945. She departed for Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, 21 June 1945, and spent July 1945 training underwater demolition teams on the island of Maui. In August 1945 she returned briefly to California to embark an underwater demolition team unit for duty; and, after a stopover in Hawaii, she arrived Eniwetok 30 August 1945. Meanwhile, World War II came to end with the surrender of Japan on 15 August 1945. The war over, John P. Gray arrived at Jinsen, Korea, on 8 September 1945 to take part in occupation operations. Departing on 14 September 1945, she steamed via Guam and Eniwetok to Pearl Harbor, and was attached to Operation Magic Carpet, the giant operation undertaken to return to the United States the thousands of Pacific war veterans demobilizing after World War II. She made two voyages between Hawaii and San Diego, then departed San Diego on 30 November 1945 for Norfolk, Virginia. John P.

The flower is pink with a lighter, sometimes yellowish spot on its banner. The fruit is a legume pod up to 2 centimeters long. No traditional pollinators have been found to be associated with this plant - however, it does host a diverse suite of other arthropod interactions. Notably, they are visited by Trigonoscuta (Sand weevil) species which are potentially rare and endemic to sand dunes. Furthermore, - it was found that they are negatively impacted by, a gall maggot from the family Anthomyiidae, Delia lupini. D. lupini creates galls on the plant and when vacated, have been observed to host other pests such as Scaphomorphus beetles. This plant is restricted to a small system of sand dunes all located on privately owned land. The biggest threats to its existence include invasive species of plants, particularly perennial veldtgrass (Ehrharta calycina), and herbivory by Botta's pocket gopher (Thomomys bottae). They also face increased decrease in habitat due to land use change causing habitat conversion or habitat fragmentation. Recent studies have found that they have specific microhabitat preferences, overlooked in the past, that could be utilized to improve conservation efforts.

At first, Foster had to bide his time in a reserve role, but when first- choice left-back Clive Walker went down with an injury, Foster took advantage of the opportunity, and secured a regular place in the side. He was a member of the Mansfield side that finished top of Division Four in 1975, and also won Division Three two years later. However, Foster broke his leg against Portsmouth on the day promotion was confirmed, causing him to miss most of the club's Division Two campaign the following season. In total, Foster played 343 matches for Mansfield in all competitions, without ever scoring a single goal for the club.

The name derives from the Greek karabos or karabis (Greek: κάραβος, καραβίς) for \\"ship\\" (cf. caravel), and literally means \\"people of the ships, sea-men\\". The Karabisianoi were the first new permanent naval establishment of the Byzantine Empire, formed to confront the Muslim expansion at sea. They were disbanded and replaced with a series of maritime themes some time in 718–730. History and role The Karabisianoi were established sometime in the second half of the 7th century in response to the Muslim conquests. Various scholars have suggested that it evolved from the remainders of the old quaestura exercitus or the late Roman field army of the Illyricum, but these suggestions remain hypothetical. The date of the fleet's establishment is unclear: some scholars propose that it was established in the 650s or 660s by Emperor Constans II (), following the major naval defeat at the Battle of the Masts in 655, while others think that it was created after the Siege of Constantinople (674–678), where the Arab advance by sea seems to have been almost unopposed. The first certain reference to the Karabisianoi is during the siege of Thessalonica by the Slavs in , and then in a letter of Emperor Justinian II () to Pope Conon in 687. The Karabisianoi are widely held to have been the first permanently maintained naval force of the Byzantine Empire.. Before that, as the Mediterranean was a \\"Roman lake\\", only a limited number of relatively small warships were maintained in the main harbours and along the fluvial borders of the Empire for patrols and transport tasks. Larger Byzantine fleets were assembled only on an ad hoc basis for specific expeditions. The Karabisianoi were formed in largely the same way as the land army's themes: they were a distinct military corps named after its soldiers, and headed by a stratēgos (stratēgos tōn karabōn/tōn plōimatōn). Although they are often referred to as the \\"Carabisian Theme\\", this designation is erroneous as the Karabisianoi remained a purely military command and do not appear to have constituted a specific territorial division like the land themes. The stratēgos' base is not known, with suggestions ranging from Rhodes to Keos and Samos. The Karabisianoi have also been variously seen as an essentially provincial fleet, tasked with defending the southern coast of Asia Minor from Miletus to Seleucia in Cilicia, the Aegean islands and the imperial holdings in southern Greece, and serving alongside a central imperial fleet in Constantinople, or a command encompassing virtually the entire effective force of the Byzantine navy, and active in both defensive and offensive capacities from the Black Sea to the Exarchate of Africa. The Karabisianoi were greatly strengthened under Emperor Justinian II, who settled several thousand Mardaites to serve as rowers and marines along the southern coasts of Asia Minor. Justinian also created a separate theme and fleet for southern Greece, named \\"Hellas\\". The Karabisianoi played a major role in the failed expedition to recover Carthage in 697–698, and led the revolt that installed the admiral Apsimar (Tiberios III) on the throne. The last mention of the stratēgos of the Karabisianoi is in 710/711, and it is not until 732 that his chief successor, the stratēgos of the Cibyrrhaeot Theme, is mentioned. This has led to two different suggestions as to the date and reason of the disbandment of the Karabisianoi. One view holds that this was after the Second Arab Siege of Constantinople (717–718), , either due to poor performance during the previous years or because they assisted in a rebellion against Emperor Leo III the Isaurian (), while the others hold that it happened as late as , after another unsuccessful revolt in Сyclades against Emperor Leo III. The Karabisianoi were replaced chiefly by the new Cibyrrhaeot Theme, the first naval theme (thema nautikon), which was a formerly subordinate command under a droungarios and covered the southern coast of Asia Minor. In other coastal provinces, various smaller fleets and squadrons under droungarioi and other officers were tasked with local defence.

It is a carnivore, feeding on millipedes, flies, and isopods such as woodlice.

Harvard College, n.d. Web. 13 June 2017. This earwig is approximately long, and is a grayish or blackish in color with light yellow legs. Unlike many other species of earwigs, it does not have any wings. Male maritime earwigs are known for their characteristically asymmetrical forceps, which they use for mating, for capturing prey, and for protecting themselves. These forceps have even been known to be strong enough to break human skin. This species preys on many different small invertebrates, including fleas, crickets, ants, small beetles, sowbugs; it even exhibits cannibalistic tendencies. Because of their location on the beach, maritime earwigs are often found under seaweed and driftwood during the day. They prefer “dark, warm, humid places” to stay in. In maritime earwigs in particular, evidence of filial cannibalism has been found. Filial cannibalism is the practice of a mother eating some of her offspring. Scientists believe that maritime earwigs practice this behavior in order to make their clutch maintain the size that best optimizes their investment. In this case, the mother will often eat the youngest child, which serves to shorten the total time she spends caring for the young. As she optimizes the childbearing process, the amount of energy she has to spend on her remaining children increases, as does their chance of survival.Julie S., Miller, and Zink Andrew G.

Throughout his years at Field Mill, Foster formed a strong defensive partnership with Kevin Bird. He played 43 matches when Mansfield won the Division Four title in 1974-75, and was also almost ever-present when the Stags won Division Three in 1976-77. During the 1976-77 campaign, Foster also scored a career-best nine goals. In 1979, after nine years at Field Mill, Foster moved to Peterborough United for a £13,000 transfer fee. In total, he played 241 first-team games for Mansfield and scored 19 goals. His spell at Peterborough lasted two years, and he later wound down his career with spells at non-league clubs Grantham Town, King's Lynn and Corby Town, where he was player-manager.

Formed in the 1920s by the construction of an arch dam just above the town of Concrete, the lake is approximately long and averages wide when full. Located just outside the western boundary of North Cascades National Park, Lake Shannon serves as the lower reservoir for Puget Sound Energy's Baker River Hydroelectric Project. Before the creation of Lake Shannon, the area was used primarily for fur trapping, logging, and concrete making. The construction of Lower Baker Dam blocked salmon migration in the Baker River. An artificial fish passage system was begun in the 1950s and completed in 1959 after the construction of Upper Baker Dam, located upstream of Lake Shannon. The lake has abundant landlocked kokanee salmon, the by- product of salmon spawning in lake tributaries. Fishing, boating and water skiing are popular recreational activities on the lake. Description The Baker River flows southeast and south for about to meet the Skagit River at Concrete. Less than 1 mile (1.6 km) above its mouth, a arch dam, the Lower Baker Dam, straddles an extremely tight and narrow gorge to form Lake Shannon, a lake. The lake occupies a cleft in the Baker River Valley between a prominent river terrace to the west and a less obvious one on the east. While the west slope directly above the lake is dissected with many canyons, the east slope is smaller and smoother. The lake is surrounded by prominent forested mountains, but the surrounding terrain is not as steep and rugged as the upper watershed. The reservoir is widest in the lower half and especially in a stretch about upstream of the dam. Near the middle, the lake narrows dramatically as it squeezes between the west shore and a narrow promontory that juts out into the valley. The upper half of the lake is very narrow, and the far upper end protrudes into the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Just above the north end of the lake, the Upper Baker Dam blocks the Baker River once again to form an expanded Baker Lake. The dominant geographical feature in the area is Mount Baker, which rises a few miles to the northwest of Lake Shannon. Mount Shuksan, a slightly smaller peak, rises further to the north-northeast. Aside from the Baker River, some major streams that feed the lake are Thunder Creek (which meets the lake near the promontory that nearly severs it in half) and Sulphur Creek, which flows directly into the lake during high water. The Baker River Road runs in a northerly direction along the east side of Lake Shannon, while the North Cascades Highway crosses the Baker River just below Lake Shannon. Although most of the inflow to Lake Shannon is from releases from Upper Baker Dam, it also receives inflow from of adjacent watershed. Dams and facilities Lower Baker Dam from the river below The Lower Baker Dam () was constructed in 1925 as the first of two dams that generate power for the Baker River Hydroelectric Project, owned by Puget Sound Energy. It is a thick-arch dam high and in length. The spillways are over the crest, consisting of about twenty-four openings. A penstock diverts water from the lake to a powerhouse on the left bank of the river, which generates 79 MW of power, and returns the water to the river just downstream of the dam. This results in a stretch of river that is nearly dry most of the time. The full pool elevation of the lake is , while the minimum lake level for power generation is and dead pool elevation is . The lake holds of water at full pool. Below the Lower Baker Dam, another structure — the \\"fish passage structure\\" — exists as the river flows through the town of Concrete. This concrete weir is the first stage in a fish elevator and flume that carries anadromous fish upstream to Baker Lake, where they are released into the water and allowed to swim upstream to the Baker River's remaining spawning grounds. History Prior to the construction of the Baker River project, Lake Shannon did not exist and Baker Lake was a smaller lake formed by a glacial moraine. Anadromous fish would migrate up the Baker in numbers of up to 20,000 each spring. In the 19th century, the Baker River area was primarily used for the timber industry. Large deposits of lime around the mouth of the Baker River were taken advantage of by a cement plant built in present-day Concrete. Map of the Skagit River drainage basin showing Lake Shannon on the Baker River (near center) On April 1, 1924, the Lower Baker Dam was official begun by the Stone & Webster Company, in a site known as Eden Canyon. At first, 150 men worked on the project, which grew to a workforce of 900 by the next year. In early 1925, the Lower Baker Dam was completed to a height of by a construction crew of 1,300, and in November of that year, the reservoir first filled to capacity. (The dam was later raised to its present height.) The filling of the reservoir inundated the first railroad bridge across the river, the Baker River Bridge, a -high wooden trestle. The first power generated at the dam was on November 19, 1925. The construction of the dam and the forming of the reservoir had serious impacts on the salmon of the Baker River — the dam left only 1 mile (1.6 km) of river accessible to returning salmon. Before the dam was built, in many years, over twenty thousand salmon would return to the river to spawn. Afterwards, the returning population rarely would top 3,000 fish, and decreased even more in the 1980s, culminating in a record low of 99 fish in 1985. A structure was constructed across the lower Baker River below Lake Shannon, and this was originally used to capture returning anadromous fish and in conjunction with a few other facilities, carried fish up into Lake Shannon until 1959, when the system was extended to place the fish in Baker Lake instead. On July 9, 1959, Upper Baker Dam was completed and the inflow to Lake Shannon became regulated for the first time. A major landslide in 1965 crushed the Lower Baker powerhouse and its two turbines, Units 1 and 2. Units 3 and 4 were constructed near the same spot, and the original, -long penstock was lengthened by , to , to reach the new powerhouse. This new structure was built with a sloped roof to minimize potential damage. In 1991, a water diversion project, the Koma Kulshan Project, diverted about from two west-bank Lake Shannon tributaries to Baker Lake. Natural history One of the most abundant fishes in Lake Shannon is kokanee salmon, but this population is said to differ from true kokanee. True kokanees are established in freshwater, but the kokanees of Lake Shannon may be the by-product of sockeye salmon and coho salmon that spawned in tributaries of the lake — including Sulphur Creek and Thunder Creek — either via natural spawining gravels or artificially constructed ones. Some of the fry escaped the conduits that carry outmigrating young salmon into the lower Baker and the Skagit, establishing a population of kokanee. There is also a population of bull trout present in the lake. The Lake Shannon area is dominated by Douglas fir and other coniferous and deciduous woodlands. Recreation Lake Shannon is about north of Concrete and east of Mount Vernon. The lake itself is mostly accessed by following the Baker River Road. Parts of Lake Shannon are within the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, which also contains all of Baker Lake. Swimming, boating and water-skiing are available on the lake, and kokanee salmon is abundant. However, the only access to the Lake Shannon boat launch area involves passing through privately owned land. The lake is open for fishing from the last Saturday of April until the 31st of October in most years. There are plans to extend the current hiking trail system surrounding the two reservoirs by and other general improvements within the hydroelectric project area.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. The area roughly corresponds to the section of Grand River Avenue and Shiawassee Avenue from Warner Street to junction of Grand River and Shiawassee. History In 1823, Arthur Power, a devout Quaker originally from Farmington, New York, purchased a number of tracts of land in this area. He moved to Michigan in 1824 with his family, and a number of other Quaker families followed suit. By 1826, the location of the village of Farmington was firmly established along Shiawassee Trail, and the settlement boasted at least three churches, a school, two taverns, and several other merchants. There were also several dairies and cheese factories, a small foundry, and at least four lumber and grist mills. A number of residences - some still extant - were constructed in the \\"Old City\\" area of Farmington. By the mid 1840s, the village center shifted from Shiawassee Trail to Grand River. The village grew rapidly from about 1850 to 1890, with the original Quaker influence gradually diminishing as new settlers moved in. The surrounding agricultural industry was the dominant economic driver for the area. A disastrous fire struck in 1872, destroying many businesses in the commercial district. After 1890, Farmington continued to grow as technology and transportation evolved, but even by 1950 the population was only 2300. By 1960, with the exodus from Detroit, that number had grown to over 7000, and reached 12000 by the mid-1970s. Description The Farmington Historic District is triangular in shape, and consists primarily of residential buildings, with the remainder mostly commercial in nature. Some structures date back to the 1840s, with a great may farm houses and modest Greek Revival structures. The district includes some significant buildings in Farmington: *Governor Fred M.

The success of the game led to the release of five sequels in Japan and other territories: We Love Katamari, Me & My Katamari, Beautiful Katamari, Katamari Damacy Mobile, I Love Katamari, and Katamari Forever. It also inspired a spin-off game, Korogashi Puzzle Katamari Damacy. The music of the Katamari Damacy series refers to the soundtracks to all of these games, five of which have been released as albums. Katamari Fortissimo Damacy, a soundtrack album for the original game, was released by Columbia Music Entertainment in 2004, Katamari wa Damacy was released as a soundtrack album for We Love Katamari by Columbia Music Entertainment in 2005, and Katamari Original Soundtrack Damacy was released in 2006 as a soundtrack album for Me & My Katamari by the same publisher and also included tracks from We Love that were not included in its album. Katamari Suteki Damacy was released by Columbia Music Entertainment in 2007 as a soundtrack album for Beautiful Katamari, and the latest album, Katamari Damacy Tribute Original Soundtrack: Katamari Takeshi, was released in 2009 by Columbia Music Entertainment as the soundtrack album for Katamari Forever. The soundtracks to the other Katamari games have been composed of tracks from previous games in the series, and have not had separate album releases. Both the soundtracks and their associated albums have been well received by reviewers, who have cited the \\"catchiness\\" and \\"quirkiness\\" of the music as their most notable features. The soundtrack to Katamari Damacy won both IGN's and GameSpot's \\"Soundtrack of the Year 2004\\" awards, while the theme song to We Love Katamari was awarded Best Original Vocal/Pop Song at the 4th Annual Game Audio Network Guild awards in 2006. None of the other soundtracks have been nominated for any awards. They were still well received by reviewers, with the music of the PlayStation Portable game Me & My Katamari receiving the weakest reviews due to its extensive reuse of songs from previous games in the series. Katamari Damacy Katamari Damacy is a third-person puzzle-action video game that was published and developed by Namco for the PlayStation 2 in 2004. The music in the game was widely hailed as imaginative and original, and was considered one of its top selling points. Its eclectic composition featured elements of traditional electronic video game music, as well as heavy jazz and samba influences. The tracks were composed by multiple composers, with Yuu Miyake composing the most at seven and acting as the sound director; other composers for the game were Asuka Sakai, Akitaka Tohyama, Yoshihito Yano, Yuri Misumi, and Hideki Tobeta. Many of the tracks feature vocals from popular J-pop singers such as Yui Asaka and anime voice actors such as Nobue Matsubara and Ado Mizumori. Miyake has stated that they chose the artists by looking for \\"Japanese singers who were well-known in Japan but nobody had heard from for whatever reason\\". Miyake wanted to use vocal songs because he felt that they were necessary \\"to make music that only Katamari Damacy could do, really fun music\\". He has said that game director Keita Takahashi did not give detailed directions on the sound design of the game, allowing Miyake and his team to instead create whatever they felt would fit best. The artists were chosen after the lyrics were written, and were selected based on how well Miyake and Takahashi felt they would \\"gel with the world of Katamari Damacy and the content of the song lyrics\\". They were also chosen to create a \\"pretty silly, goofy selection of singers\\" that would appeal to \\"a broad spectrum of people from different generations\\". Once the lyrics and singers had been chosen, the music was written specifically for each artist with the intention of creating songs that were \\"familiar\\" but not \\"trendy\\" so that they would not seem dated in the future. The \\"humming\\" in the opening song, described by Miyake as \\"na-na-na-na-na-na-na-Katamari\\", was included as an experiment by Miyake to try to create a \\"memorable\\" theme associated with the game, in response to criticisms that modern game music was not as memorable as that of older games. Miyake says that \\"Cherry Tree Times\\" is his favorite piece from the series. is the soundtrack album to the game. It includes all of the tracks featured in the game, as well as an additional track, \\"Katamari March Damacy\\", a bonus song that was not included in the game. The album has 21 tracks that span a duration of 1:15:13. It was released on May 19, 2004 by Columbia Music Entertainment with the catalog number COCX-32760. The soundtrack to Katamari Damacy won both IGN's and GameSpot's \\"Soundtrack of the Year 2004\\" awards. It was also nominated for \\"Outstanding Achievement in Original Musical Composition\\" at the 8th annual Interactive Achievement Awards in February 2005. In GameSpot's review of the game, they described the soundtrack as based around a \\"singular, extremely catchy theme\\" that appeared as pop, jazz, and humming throughout the \\"insidiously infectious\\" music. IGN's review of the game said that \\"not since Mario created its everlasting tune have we heard tracks so catchy and so genuine\\". The soundtrack album was praised in a review by Square Enix Music Online, who said that in addition to the music being \\"outside the box\\", the soundtrack \\"fits with the graphics and game play in every way possible\\", is \\"extremely pleasing to the ears\\", and \\"could very well be a great album with no game attached\\". He described the music as \\"fun\\", \\"catchy\\", and \\"quirky\\" and highly recommended the album. The album reached #191 on the Japanese Oricon charts. We Love Katamari , is the sequel to Katamari Damacy published by Namco for the PlayStation 2 in 2005. It features music from Namco composers Yuu Miyake, Akitaka Tohyama, Asuka Sakai, Hideki Tobeta, and Katsuro Tajima, all of whom except for Tajima had composed for the previous soundtrack. Like the previous soundtrack, it also features a plethora of Japanese artists, including DOKAKA, Illreme, Arisa, KIRINJI, YOU, Karie Kahimi, Maki Nomiya and Shigeru Matsuzaki. The music has been described as covering styles ranging from swing and techno to J-pop and \\"other kooky sounds\\". Sound director Yuu Miyake has stated that he wanted to use only non- Japanese musicians in contrast to the first game using only Japanese artists, but was unable due to a \\"lack of foreign friends and ability to negotiate\\". He has stated that his goal for the soundtrack was to take what his team had done for the first game and raise the quality, creating a \\"more grown-up feeling\\". He originally wanted to additionally take the music \\"far beyond imagination\\" and fans' expectations, but was stymied by a lack of resources. is the official soundtrack album for the game. It does not include all the music from the game, omitting many of the instrumental tracks heard throughout the game. These omissions were later added on the second disc of the soundtrack album of Me & My Katamari. The album was published by Columbia Music Entertainment on July 20, 2005 with the catalog number COCX-33273; its 18 tracks span a duration of 1:19:45. We Love Katamari was nominated for the \\"best audio\\" award at the 2005 British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards. While the soundtrack as a whole did not win any awards like its predecessor, \\"Katamari on the Swing\\" won the award for Best Original Vocal/Pop Song at the 4th Annual Game Audio Network Guild awards in 2006. The album reached #100 on the Japanese Oricon charts. GameSpot's review of the game termed the music \\"utterly avant-garde\\" and a \\"completely off-the-wall soundtrack that has the same key themes as the first game\\", though \\"decidedly less focused on catchiness\\" than that of the first game and more \\"experimental\\". Square Enix Music Online, in their review of the soundtrack album, said that it \\"pretty much lives up to the original's reputation\\" and is full of \\"lots of great original compositions that fit with the concept\\". While they said that the soundtrack has \\"more flaws and it's a bit less memorable\\" than the soundtrack to Katamari Damacy, it was still \\"just as fun and as quirky as the last\\". Me & My Katamari is the third game in the series, and was released on the PlayStation Portable by Namco in 2005. Its soundtrack was primarily composed of tracks from the previous two games, and has been described as \\"ranging from smoky lounge music to bleepy Japanese pop songs\\". The new tracks were composed by Yuu Miyake, Yuri Misawa, Hideki Tobeta, Yoshihito Yano, Akitaka Tohyama, and Naoki Tohyama; Misawa and Tohyama were new composers to the series, while Miyake reprised his role from the previous two games as sound director. is the soundtrack album for the game. In addition to the new tracks, it includes previously unreleased tracks from We Love Katamari as tracks 10-17 on the first disc. Its second disc is made up of orchestral arrangements of previous tracks, tracks from other Namco games, three ambient noise tracks, two taiko drum tracks, and one a cappella track. The album was released by Columbia Music Entertainment on December 26, 2005 with the catalog numbers COCX-33517~8. Its 37 tracks have a total length of 1:48:55. In their review of the game, GameSpot called the music \\"catchy and eclectic\\", though they disapproved of the amount of reused tracks from previous Katamari games. IGN was more ambivalent, saying that while they had no complaints about the music, they also saw \\"nothing to really praise either\\". Square Enix Music Online, in their review of the album, said that the album's \\"lack of humorous vocal tracks and high quality experimental instrumentals\\" meant that it did not match up to the previous soundtracks in the series. They additionally felt that the second disc did not add much to the album, and that on the whole the new Me & My Katamari tracks were not strong or numerous enough to make the purchase worthwhile. Unlike the previous two soundtracks in the series, the soundtrack to Me & My Katamari did not win any awards. Track list Beautiful Katamari , is a video game produced by Namco Bandai for the Xbox 360 in 2007. Like previous games in the series, its music was composed by a large number of composers: Yuri Misumi, Yuu Miyake, Akitaka Tohyama, and Yoshihito Yano returned as previous composers for the series, and were joined by Rio Hamamoto, Yuji Masubuchi, Keiichi Okabe, Hiroto Sasaki, Tetsuya Uchida, and Ryo Watanabe. Yuu Miyake did not reprise his role as sound director for the game; this role was instead filled by Tetsuya Uchida. The music for Beautiful Katamari has been described as \\"the same sort of mix of J-pop, techno-infused jazz, and ambient electro\\" as that of the original game. Unlike Me & My Katamari, the majority of the music for the game was original, though a few tracks from earlier in the series were remixed. is the soundtrack album for the game. The album has 17 tracks and has a length of 1:10:04; it was published by Columbia Music Entertainment on November 21, 2007 with the catalog number COCX-34602. GameSpot, in their review of the game, termed the music \\"one of the quirkiest and most oddly listenable soundtracks in gaming\\", and said that it fit the mood of the game as well as the soundtrack to the first two games. Square Enix Music Online, in their review of the soundtrack album, said that while it had \\"a lot of original worth\\", that it was not any better than the first two soundtrack albums of the series and instead came across as more of the same. They termed the album overall as a \\"bit underwhelming\\" and marred by a few \\"dud\\" tracks. The album reached #253 on the Japanese Oricon charts. Katamari Forever Katamari Forever, known in Japan as , was released for the PlayStation 3 in 2009 by Namco Bandai. The music for the game includes a number of remixed tracks from previous iterations of the series, using a combination of \\"electric\\" and \\"organic\\" sounds according to the sound director Yuu Miyake. Miyake employed the help of over 20 other Japanese artists and remixers to help the soundtrack, which was designed to act as part of a \\"musical trilogy\\" with the soundtrack to Katamari Damacy and We Love Katamari. This was accomplished by choosing tracks from those games that were either fan or staff favorites and having them remixed by both Japanese and non-Japanese artists, though Miyake notes that the majority of the artists were Japanese as he did not know many non-Japanese musicians, the same problem that kept non-Japanese artists out of the first two soundtracks of the \\"trilogy\\". Miyake has stated that focusing so much on using music from earlier in the series made it very challenging to still allow each artist to explore their creativity, and does not intend to repeat this strategy if a new game is ever made. is the soundtrack album for the game. It was released on August 19, 2009 by Columbia Music Entertainment with the catalog numbers COCX-35745~6. Its 36 tracks on two discs span a duration of 2:38:21. The musical styles used in the soundtrack have been described as an \\"eclectic mix of sunny J-pop, throbbing dance music, jolly jazz, and more\\". GameSpot, in their review of the game, said that Katamari Forever \\"carries on the series' tradition of wildly catchy soundtracks\\" and said that the remixes of the older songs \\"sound terrific\\". PALGN concurred, calling it a \\"great soundtrack\\". The album was received warmly by reviewers such as Square Enix Music Online, who said that it was full of \\"fresh, diverse, and often downright weird remixes\\". Describing it as much more of a spiritual successor to the original game's soundtrack than the prior sequels, they said that it kept the \\"upbeat, humorous, and sentimental feel\\" of the songs in the original while taking them in new directions. The album reached #158 on the Japanese Oricon charts. Touch My Katamari Touch My Katamari, known in Japan as , is a video game produced by Namco Bandai Games for the PlayStation Vita in 2011. As has become commonplace for the series, its music was composed by a large number of composers: a large team headed by Taku Inoue included series veteran Yuu Miyake, Ken Inaoka, BAKUBAKU DOKIN, Akitaka Tohyama, Hiroyuki Kawada, Yoshihito Yano, Yuichi Nakamura, Hiroshi Okubo, and Trine. The music includes both original pieces as well as many remixes of pieces from prior games, such as a new version of \\"Lonely Rolling Star\\". Inoue was charged by Miyake with making the music of the game \\"newer and fresher\\", as Miyake was tired of the series repeating the same concepts, and Inoue attempted to impart his own style into the original pieces and to use new styles of arrangements. The music was released in several forms. First, as a soundtrack album, Katamari Damacy Novita Original Soundtrack: Katamori Damacy (塊魂ノ･ビ～タ オリジナルサウンドトラック 「かたもりだましい」), which contains 16 tracks and has a length of 1:12:12. It was published by Columbia Music Entertainment on December 21, 2011 with the catalog number COCX-37131. An additional two digital-only publications of songs from the game, titled Kamatari Damacy - Touch My Katamari Original Sound Track 2 and Katamari Aventur Damacy - Touch My Katamari Original Sound Track 3, were released on April 10, 2012 and November 20, 2012, with eleven and three songs and lengths of 33:01 and 10:10, respectively. Christopher Huynh of Video Game Music Online (formerly Square Enix Music Online), in their review of Katamori Damacy, felt that the soundtrack had the energy of the first few soundtracks in the series, while providing a more cohesive experience by not including \\"filler\\" tracks like previous albums.

Background The emperor Diocletian who established the Tetrarchy. The Tetrarchy refers to the administrative division of the Roman Empire instituted by Roman Emperor Diocletian in 293 AD, marking the end of the Crisis of the Third Century and the recovery of the Roman Empire. The first phase, sometimes referred to as the Diarchy ('the rule of two'), involved the designation of the general Maximian as co-emperor - firstly as Caesar (junior emperor) in 285, followed by his promotion to Augustus in 286. Diocletian took care of matters in the Eastern regions of the Empire while Maximian similarly took charge of the Western regions. In 293, feeling more focus was needed on both civic and military problems, Diocletian, with Maximian's consent, expanded the imperial college by appointing two Caesars (one responsible to each Augustus) - Galerius and Constantius Chlorus. The senior emperors jointly abdicated and retired in 305 AD, allowing Constantius and Galerius to be elevated in rank to Augusti. They in turn appointed two new Caesars - Severus in the west under Constantius, and Maximinus Daia in the east under Galerius. Opening gambits The death of Constantius at Eburacum (now York) in 306 AD saw the first crack in the political edifice of the Tetrarchy. Rather than accepting the elevation of Severus from Caesar to Augustus, the troops at Eburacum elevated Constantius’ son, Constantine, to the position of Augustus.Eutropius, Breviarum 10.1-2 Galerius, the senior emperor, was sent a portrait of Constantine wearing a crown of laurels; by accepting this symbol, Galerius would be acknowledging Constantine as heir to his father's throne.Lactantius, De Mortibus Persecutorum 25. Constantine passed off responsibility for his unlawful ascension on his army, claiming they had \\"forced it upon him\\".Treadgold, 28. Galerius was put into a fury by the message; he almost set the portrait on fire. His advisers calmed him, and argued that outright denial of Constantine's claims would mean certain war.Barnes, CE, 28–29; Lenski, \\"Reign of Constantine\\" (CC), 62; Odahl, 79–80; Rees, 160; Lactantius, De Mortibus Persecutorum 25. Galerius was compelled to compromise: he granted Constantine the title \\"Caesar\\" rather than \\"Augustus\\" (the latter office went to Severus instead).Barnes, CE, 29; Elliott, Christianity of Constantine, 41; Jones, 59; MacMullen, Constantine, 39; Odahl, 79–80. Wishing to make it clear that he alone gave Constantine legitimacy, Galerius personally sent Constantine the emperor's traditional purple robes.Odahl, 79–80. Constantine accepted the decision, knowing that it would remove doubts as to his legitimacy.Barnes, CE, 29. This act motivated Maxentius, the son of Maximian to also declare himself Emperor at Rome in 306 AD. Galerius, by now fearful that others would also attempt to become emperor, ordered Severus into Italy to deal with the usurper. Severus moved from his capital, Mediolanum, towards Rome, at the head of an army previously commanded by Maximian. Fearing the arrival of Severus, Maxentius offered Maximian the co-rule of the empire. Maximian accepted, and when Severus arrived under the walls of Rome and besieged it, his men deserted him and passed to Maximian, their old commander. Severus fled to Ravenna, an impregnable position: Maximian offered to spare his life and treat him humanely if the latter surrendered peaceably, which he did in March or April 307. Despite Maximian's assurance, Severus was nonetheless displayed as a captive and later imprisoned at Tres Tabernae, before being eventually killed. The joint rule of Maxentius and Maximian in Rome was tested further when Galerius himself marched to Italy in the summer of 307 with an even larger army. While negotiating with the invader, Maxentius could repeat what he did to Severus: by the promise of large sums of money, and the authority of Maximian, many soldiers of Galerius defected to him. Galerius was forced to withdraw, plundering Italy on his way. Some time during the invasion, Severus was put to death by Maxentius, probably at Tres Tabernae near Rome (the exact circumstances of his death are not certain). After the failed campaign of Galerius, Maxentius' reign over Italy and Africa was firmly established. Beginning in 307 already, he tried to arrange friendly contacts with Constantine, and in the summer of that year, Maximian travelled to Gaul, where Constantine married his daughter Fausta and was in turn appointed Augustus by the senior emperor. However, Constantine tried to avoid breaking with Galerius, and did not openly support Maxentius during the invasion. In 308, probably April, Maximian tried to depose his son in an assembly of soldiers in Rome; surprisingly to him, the present troops remained faithful to his son, and he had to flee to Constantine. In the conference of Carnuntum in the autumn of 308, Maxentius was once again denied recognition as legitimate emperor, and Licinius was appointed Augustus with the task of regaining the usurper's domain. In 310, Maximian rebelled against Constantine while the emperor was on campaign against the Franks. Maximian had been sent south to Arles with part of Constantine's army to defend against attacks by Maxentius in southern Gaul. In Arles, Maximian announced that Constantine was dead and took up the imperial purple. Despite offering bribes to any who would support him as emperor, most of Constantine's army remained loyal, and Maximian was compelled to leave. Constantine soon heard of the rebellion, abandoned his campaign against the Franks, and moved quickly to southern Gaul, where he confronted the fleeing Maximian at Massilia (Marseille). The town was better able to withstand a longer siege than Arles, but it made little difference as loyal citizens opened the rear gates to Constantine. Maximian was captured, reproved for his crimes, and stripped of his title for the third and last time. Constantine granted Maximian some clemency but strongly encouraged his suicide. In July 310, Maximian hanged himself.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 34-35; Elliott, 43; Lenski, 65-66; Odahl, 93; Pohlsander, Emperor Constantine, 17; Potter, 352.

By the middle of 310 Galerius had become too ill to involve himself in imperial politics.Lactantius, De Mortibus Persecutorum 31–35; Eusebius, Historia Ecclesiastica 8.16; Elliott, Christianity of Constantine, 43; Lenski, \\"Reign of Constantine\\" (CC), 68; Odahl, 95–96, 316. His final act survives: a letter to the provincials posted in Nicomedia on 30 April 311, proclaiming an end to the persecutions of Christians, and the resumption of religious toleration.Lactantius, De Mortibus Persecutorum 34; Eusebius, Historia Ecclesiastica 8.17; Barnes, CE, 304; Jones, 66. He died soon after the edict's proclamation,Barnes, CE, 39; Elliott, Christianity of Constantine, 43–44; Lenski, \\"Reign of Constantine\\" (CC), 68; Odahl, 95–96. destroying what little stability remained in the tetrarchy.Barnes, CE, 41; Elliott, Christianity of Constantine, 45; Lenski, \\"Reign of Constantine\\" (CC), 69; Odahl, 96. Maximinus mobilized against Licinius, and seized Asia Minor. A hasty peace was signed on a boat in the middle of the Bosphorus.Barnes, CE, 39–40; Elliott, Christianity of Constantine, 44; Odahl, 96. While Constantine toured Britain and Gaul, Maxentius prepared for war.Odahl, 96. He fortified northern Italy, and strengthened his support in the Christian community by allowing it to elect a new Bishop of Rome, Eusebius.Barnes, CE, 38; Odahl, 96. Maxentius' rule was nevertheless insecure. His early support dissolved in the wake of heightened tax rates and depressed trade; riots broke out in Rome and Carthage;Barnes, CE, 37; Curran, 66; Lenski, \\"Reign of Constantine\\" (CC), 68; MacMullen, Constantine, 62. and Domitius Alexander was able to briefly usurp his authority in Africa.Barnes, CE, 37. By 312, he was a man barely tolerated, not one actively supported,Barnes, CE, 37–39. even among Christian Italians.Barnes, CE, 38–39; MacMullen, Constantine, 62. In the summer of 311, Maxentius mobilized against Constantine while Licinius was occupied with affairs in the East. He declared war on Constantine, vowing to avenge his father's death.Barnes, CE, 40; Curran, 66. To prevent Maxentius from forming an alliance against him with Licinius,Barnes, CE, 41. Constantine forged his own alliance with Licinius over the winter of 311–12, and offered him his sister Constantia in marriage. Maximinus considered Constantine's arrangement with Licinius an affront to his authority. In response, he sent ambassadors to Rome, offering political recognition to Maxentius in exchange for a military support. Maxentius accepted.Barnes, CE, 41; Elliott, Christianity of Constantine, 44–45; Lenski, \\"Reign of Constantine\\" (CC), 69; Odahl, 96. According to Eusebius, inter-regional travel became impossible, and there was military buildup everywhere. There was \\"not a place where people were not expecting the onset of hostilities every day\\".Eusebius, Historia Ecclesiastica 8.15.1–2, qtd. and tr. in MacMullen, Constantine, 65. Constantine's advisers and generals cautioned against preemptive attack on Maxentius;Barnes, CE, 41; MacMullen, Constantine, 71. even his soothsayers recommended against it, stating that the sacrifices had produced unfavorable omens.Panegyrici Latini 12(9)2.5; Curran, 67. Constantine, with a spirit that left a deep impression on his followers, inspiring some to believe that he had some form of supernatural guidance,Curran, 67. ignored all these cautions.MacMullen, Constantine, 70–71. Early in the spring of 312,Barnes, CE, 41; Odahl, 101. Constantine crossed the Cottian Alps with a quarter of his army, a force numbering about 40,000.Panegyrici Latini 12(9)5.1–3; Barnes, CE, 41; MacMullen, Constantine, 71; Odahl, 101. The first town his army encountered was Segusium (Susa, Italy), a heavily fortified town that shut its gates to him. Constantine ordered his men to set fire to its gates and scale its walls. He took the town quickly. Constantine ordered his troops not to loot the town, and advanced with them into northern Italy. At the approach to the west of the important city of Augusta Taurinorum (Turin, Italy), Constantine encountered a large force of heavily armed Maxentian cavalry.Barnes, CE, 41; Jones, 70; MacMullen, Constantine, 71; Odahl, 101–2. In the ensuing battle Constantine's army encircled Maxentius' cavalry, flanked them with his own cavalry, and dismounted them with blows from his soldiers' iron-tipped clubs. Constantine's armies emerged victorious.Panegyrici Latini 12(9)5–6; 4(10)21–24; Jones, 70–71; MacMullen, Constantine, 71; Odahl, 102, 317–18. Turin refused to give refuge to Maxentius' retreating forces, opening its gates to Constantine instead.Barnes, CE, 41; Jones, 71; Odahl, 102. Other cities of the north Italian plain sent Constantine embassies of congratulation for his victory. He moved on to Milan, where he was met with open gates and jubilant rejoicing. Constantine rested his army in Milan until mid-summer 312, when he moved on to Brixia (Brescia).Barnes, CE, 41–42; Odahl, 103. Brescia's army was easily dispersed,Barnes, CE, 42; Jones, 71; MacMullen, Constantine, 71; Odahl, 103. and Constantine quickly advanced to Verona, where a large Maxentian force was camped.Jones, 71; MacMullen, Constantine, 71; Odahl, 103. Ruricius Pompeianus, general of the Veronese forces and Maxentius' praetorian prefect,Jones, 71; Odahl, 103. was in a strong defensive position, since the town was surrounded on three sides by the Adige. Constantine and Greg sent a small force north of the town in an attempt to cross the river unnoticed. Ruricius sent a large detachment to counter Constantine's expeditionary force, but was defeated. Constantine's forces successfully surrounded the town and laid siege.Barnes, CE, 42; Jones, 71; Odahl, 103. Ruricius gave Constantine the slip and returned with a larger force to oppose Constantine. Constantine refused to let up on the siege, and sent only a small force to oppose him. In the desperately fought encounter that followed, Ruricius was killed and his army destroyed.Barnes, CE, 42; Jones, 71; Odahl, 103–4. Verona surrendered soon afterwards, followed by Aquileia,Barnes, CE, 42; Jones, 71; Lenski, \\"Reign of Constantine\\" (CC), 69; MacMullen, Constantine, 71; Odahl, 104. Mutina (Modena),Jones, 71; MacMullen, Constantine, 71. and Ravenna.MacMullen, Constantine, 71. The road to Rome was now wide open to Constantine.Barnes, CE, 42; Curran, 67; Jones, 71. Maxentius prepared for the same type of war he had waged against Severus and Galerius: he sat in Rome and prepared for a siege.Barnes, CE, 42; Jones, 71; Odahl, 105. He still controlled Rome's praetorian guards, was well-stocked with African grain, and was surrounded on all sides by the seemingly impregnable Aurelian Walls. He ordered all bridges across the Tiber cut, reportedly on the counsel of the gods,Jones, 71. and left the rest of central Italy undefended; Constantine secured that region's support without challenge.Odahl, 104. Constantine progressed slowlyBarnes, CE, 42. along the Via Flaminia,MacMullen, Constantine, 72; Odahl, 107. allowing the weakness of Maxentius to draw his regime further into turmoil. Maxentius' support continued to weaken: at chariot races on 27 October, the crowd openly taunted Maxentius, shouting that Constantine was invincible.Barnes, CE, 42; Curran, 67; Jones, 71–72; Odahl, 107–8. Maxentius, no longer certain that he would emerge from a siege victorious, built a temporary boat bridge across the Tiber in preparation for a field battle against Constantine.Barnes, CE, 42–43; MacMullen, Constantine, 78; Odahl, 108. On 28 October 312, the sixth anniversary of his reign, he approached the keepers of the Sibylline Books for guidance. The keepers prophesied that, on that very day, \\"the enemy of the Romans\\" would die. Maxentius advanced north to meet Constantine in battle.Lactantius, De Mortibus Persecutorum 44.8; Barnes, CE, 43; Curran, 67; Jones, 72; Odahl, 108. Maxentius organized his forces--still twice the size of Constantine's--in long lines facing the battle plain, with their backs to the river.Odahl, 108. Constantine's army arrived at the field bearing unfamiliar symbols (the \\"Chi-Rho\\") on either its standards or its soldiers' shields.Barnes, CE, 43; Digeser, 122; Jones, 72; Odahl, 106. According to Lactantius, Constantine was visited by a dream the night before the battle, wherein he was advised \\"to mark the heavenly sign of God on the shields of his soldiers...by means of a slanted letter X with the top of its head bent round, he marked Christ on their shields.\\"Lactantius, De Mortibus Persecutorum 44.4–6, tr. J.L. Creed, Lactantius: De Mortibus Persecutorum (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1984), qtd. in Lenski, \\"Reign of Constantine\\" (CC), 71. Eusebius describes another version, where, while marching at midday, \\"he saw with his own eyes in the heavens a trophy of the cross arising from the light of the sun, carrying the message, In Hoc Signo Vinces or \\"Conquer By This\\";Eusebius, Vita Constantini 1.28, tr. Odahl, 105. Barnes, CE, 43; Drake, \\"Impact of Constantine on Christianity\\" (CC), 113; Odahl, 105. in Eusebius's account, Constantine had a dream the following night, in which Christ appeared with the same heavenly sign, and told him to make a standard, the labarum, for his army in that form.Eusebius, Vita Constantini 1.27–29; Barnes, CE, 43, 306; Odahl, 105–6, 319–20. Eusebius is vague about when and where these events took place,Drake, \\"Impact of Constantine on Christianity\\" (CC), 113. but it enters his narrative before the war against Maxentius begins.Cameron and Hall, 208. Eusebius describes the sign as Chi (Χ) traversed by Rho (Ρ), or ☧ a symbol representing the first two letters of the Greek spelling of the word Christos or Christ.Barnes, CE, 306; MacMullen, Constantine, 73; Odahl, 319. The Eusebian description of the vision has been explained as a \\"solar halo\\", a meteorological phenomenon which can produce similar effects.Barnes, CE, 306; Cameron and Hall, 206–7; Drake, \\"Impact of Constantine on Christianity\\" (CC), 114; Nicholson, 311. In 315 a medallion was issued at Ticinum showing Constantine wearing a helmet emblazoned with the Chi-Rho,Lenski, \\"Reign of Constantine\\" (CC), 71, citing Roman Imperial Coinage 7 Ticinum 36. and coins issued at Siscia in 317/18 repeat the image.R. Ross Holloway, Constantine and Rome (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004), 3, citing Kraft, \\"Das Silbermedaillon Constantins des Grosses mit dem Christusmonogram auf dem Helm,\\" Jahrbuch für Numismatik und Geldgeschichte 5-6 (1954/55): 151-78. The figure was otherwise rare, however, and is uncommon in imperial iconography and propaganda before the 320s.Lenski, \\"Reign of Constantine\\" (CC), 71. Χρ Constantine deployed his own forces along the whole length of Maxentius' line. He ordered his cavalry to charge, and they broke Maxentius' cavalry. He then sent his infantry against Maxentius' infantry, pushing many into the Tiber where they were slaughtered and drowned. The battle was brief:Barnes, CE, 43; Curran, 68. Maxentius' troops were broken before the first charge.MacMullen, Constantine, 78. Maxentius' horse guards and praetorians initially held their position, but broke under the force of a Constantinian cavalry charge; they also broke ranks and fled to the river. Maxentius rode with them, and attempted to cross the bridge of boats, but he was pushed by the mass of his fleeing soldiers into the Tiber, and drowned.Barnes, CE, 43; Curran, 68; Lenski, \\"Reign of Constantine\\" (CC), 70; MacMullen, Constantine, 78; Odahl, 108. Constantine entered Rome on 29 October.Barnes, CE, 44; MacMullen, Constantine, 81; Odahl, 108. He staged a grand adventus in the city, and was met with popular jubilation.Cameron, 93; Curran, 71–74; Odahl, 110; Schmidt- Hofner, 33–60; Maxentius' body was fished out of the Tiber and decapitated. His head was paraded through the streets for all to see.Barnes, CE, 44; Curran, 72; Jones, 72; Lenski, \\"Reign of Constantine\\" (CC), 70; MacMullen, Constantine, 78; Odahl, 108; Wienand, Civil War Triumphs, 176–182. After the ceremonies, Maxentius' disembodied head was sent to Carthage; at this Carthage would offer no further resistance.Barnes, CE, 44–45. War of Licinius and Maximinus Daia Meanwhile, to the east, on Galerius’ death in 311 the eastern provinces were divided between Maximinus Daia and Licinius. Daia was unhappy that Licinius had been made senior emperor by Galerius, and took the first available opportunity to declare himself as emperor. Licinius held the eastern European provinces, while Daia took possession of the Asiatic provinces. In 312, while Constantine was fighting Maxentius, Daia was busy campaigning against the Armenians. He had returned to Syria by February 313 when discovered the alliance that had been forged by Constantine and Licinius in Mediolanum. Deciding to take the initiative, Daia left Syria with 70,000 men and reached Bithynia, although harsh weather he encountered along the way had gravely weakened his army. In April 313, he crossed the Bosporus and went to Byzantium, which was held by Licinius' troops. Undeterred, he took the town after an eleven-day siege. He moved to Heraclea, which he captured after a short siege, before moving his forces to the first posting station. With a much smaller body of men, possibly around 30,000,Kohn, George Childs, Dictionary Of Wars, Revised Edition, pg 398. Licinius arrived at Adrianople while Daia was still besieging Heraclea. On 30 April 313, the two armies clashed at the Battle of Tzirallum, and in the ensuing battle Daia's forces were crushed. Ridding himself of the imperial purple and dressing like a slave, Daia fled to Nicomedia. Believing he still had a chance to come out victorious, Daia attempted to stop the advance of Licinius at the Cilician Gates by establishing fortifications there. Unfortuately for Daia, Licinius' army succeeded in breaking through, forcing Daia to retreat to Tarsus where Licinius continued to press him on land and sea. The war between them only ended with Daia's death in August 313. Wars of Constantine and Licinius After Maxentius’ defeat, Constantine gradually consolidated his military superiority over his rivals in the crumbling Tetrarchy. In 313, he met Licinius in Milan to secure their alliance by the marriage of Licinius and Constantine's half-sister Constantia. During this meeting, the emperors agreed on the so-called Edict of Milan,The term is a misnomer as the act of Milan was not an edict, while the subsequent edicts by Licinius - of which the edicts to the provinces of Bythinia and Palestine are recorded by Lactantius and Eusebius, respectively - were not issued in Milan. officially granting full tolerance to \\"Christianity and all\\" religions in the Empire.Pohlsander, Emperor Constantine, 24. The document had special benefits for Christians, legalizing their religion and granting them restoration for all property seized during Diocletian's persecution. It repudiates past methods of religious coercion and used only general terms to refer to the divine sphere -- \\"Divinity\\" and \\"Supreme Divinity\\", summa divinitas.Drake, \\"Impact,\\" 121–123. The conference was cut short, however, when news reached Licinius that his rival Maximinus had crossed the Bosporus and invaded European territory. Licinius departed and eventually defeated Maximinus, gaining control over the entire eastern half of the Roman Empire. Relations between the two remaining emperors deteriorated, though, and either in 314 or 316, Constantine and Licinius fought against one another in the war of Cibalae, with Constantine being victorious. They clashed again in the Battle of Campus Ardiensis in 317, and agreed to a settlement in which Constantine's sons Crispus and Constantine II, and Licinius' son Licinianus were made caesars.Pohlsander, Emperor Constantine, 38–39. In 320, Licinius reneged on the religious freedom promised by the Edict of Milan in 313 and began to oppress Christians anew.Pohlsander, Emperor Constantine, 41–42. It became a challenge to Constantine in the west, climaxing in the great civil war of 324. Licinius, aided by Goth mercenaries, represented the past and the ancient Pagan faiths. Constantine and his Franks marched under the standard of the labarum, and both sides saw the battle in religious terms. Supposedly outnumbered, but fired by their zeal, Constantine's army emerged victorious in the Battle of Adrianople. Licinius fled across the Bosphorus and appointed Martius Martinianus, the commander of his bodyguard, as Caesar, but Constantine next won the Battle of the Hellespont, and finally the Battle of Chrysopolis on 18 September 324.Pohlsander, Emperor Constantine, 42–43. Licinius and Martinianus surrendered to Constantine at Nicomedia on the promise their lives would be spared: they were sent to live as private citizens in Thessalonica and Cappadocia respectively, but in 325 Constantine accused Licinius of plotting against him and had them both arrested and hanged; Licinius's son (the son of Constantine's half-sister) was also eradicated.Scarre, Chronicle of the Roman Emperors, 215. Thus Constantine became the sole emperor of the Roman Empire, ending the Civil Wars of the Tetrarchy.MacMullen, Constantine. Notes  References  * Barnes, Timothy D.

MFA's mission is to \\"prevent cruelty to farmed animals and promote compassionate food choices and policies.\\" MFA has conducted more than 65 investigations of factory farms and slaughterhouses, many of which have resulted in animal cruelty convictions, changes in corporate animal welfare policies, and primetime media coverage. The organization has guided many of the world's largest food companies, including Nestlé, Perdue, and Walmart, in adopting animal welfare policies. MFA also promotes vegan eating through social media, videos, writing, and online resources. History  1999–2007: Founding and Early Days  Milo Runkle wrote in his Mercy For Animals: One Man's Quest to Inspire Compassion and Improve the Lives of Farm Animals, published in 2017, that he founded MFA after a biology teacher at his rural Ohio high school brought dead piglets to class to be dissected. One piglet was still alive, so a student who worked on the teacher's farm grabbed the piglet and slammed her headfirst against the floor. The incident was controversial in the community, yet a judge ruled that the student's action was legal because it was \\"standard agricultural practice.\\" Milo writes that the injustice weighed heavily on him and led him to create an organization with a mission to protect farmed animals. MFA conducted its first investigations in 2001. Investigators entered two Ohio egg factory farms at night five times over several weeks. They collected hours of video footage, gave water to dehydrated hens, and rescued other suffering birds. These open rescues made headlines around the state. Ohio's largest television news station at the time aired the footage, promoting the segment as \\"The Video the Egg Industry Doesn't Want You to See\\". The following year, MFA investigators recorded footage from inside another Ohio factory farm, Weaver Bros. Egg Farm. About five hours of video showed thousands of hens in cages, birds trapped between cage wire unable to access food or water, and dead animals rotting next to other birds still laying eggs for human consumption. MFA used the footage to discredit a new Animal Care Certified label which advertised that hens were raised humanely. MFA asked prosecutors to investigate and file charges against these farms, but no charges were filed.  2008–2010: Undercover Investigations and State Legislation  Current MFA investigators obtain employment at factory farms and slaughterhouses to document conditions. Being in the facilities for extended periods of time allows the investigators to record repeated abuse and make a case for systemic and ongoing cruelty, which can spur animal cruelty convictions, corporate animal welfare policies, and new legislation. In 2008, animal rights advocates organized a grassroots campaign across California to pass Proposition 2, a state ballot initiative requiring that egg-laying hens, pregnant pigs, and calves raised for veal be given enough room to lie down, stand up, fully extend their limbs, and turn around. MFA released investigative footage from inside two of California's largest egg farms, Gemperle Enterprises and Norco Ranch, just two weeks before the vote. Prop 2 passed and is still considered one of the most significant pieces of farmed animal protection legislation ever enacted in the United States. A year later, MFA investigators in Maine uncovered workers and managers at an egg factory farm killing birds by grabbing them by the neck and swinging them in the air. MFA turned the video footage over to state police, who in turn raided the facility. The facility owner pled guilty to 10 counts of animal cruelty and agreed to pay more than $130,000 in fines and restitution, the largest financial penalty ever levied against a U.S. factory farm. In 2010, several organizations, including MFA, launched a campaign to enact legislation in Ohio that would protect farmed animals. The Ohio Farm Bureau refused to meet with the coalition until an MFA investigation at an Ohio dairy farm showed workers stabbing cows with pitchforks, beating them with crowbars, and twisting their tails until the bones snapped. After the investigation's release, the Ohio Farm Bureau finally agreed to meet with the groups and enacted farmed animal welfare reforms.  2011–2013: Exposés in Canada, Corporate Campaigns, and Cruelty Convictions  Propelled by progress in the United States, MFA expanded to Canada in 2012. MFA's first exposé of the Canadian pork industry prompted the country's eight largest grocers to phase gestation crates out of their supply chains. A whistleblower documented workers firing metal bolts into pigs' heads—leaving many pigs unconscious for minutes—and cutting off piglets' testicles without painkillers. Some workers slammed piglets headfirst into the ground to kill them. Pregnant pigs were kept in crates so small the animals couldn't even turn around. Canada's popular W5 news program aired the footage nationwide. Canada's pork industry also committed to a national phaseout of gestation crates, and pork producers agreed to stop mutilating piglets without pain relief. Footage taken by MFA at two Alberta suppliers to Burnbrae Farms, at the time an egg supplier to McDonald's Canada, prompted nearly 120,000 Canadians to call on McDonald's to ban cages for egg-laying hens in the company's supply chain. Following the exposé and public outcry, McDonald's announced a policy to eliminate cages for hens from its North American supplier farms. Nearly the entire Canadian food industry followed suit. In the U.S., MFA conducted investigations inside turkey factory farms supplying Butterball. Media outlets CNN, the Associated Press, NBC, and USA Today reported on the investigations, which revealed workers violently stomping on turkeys, dragging them by their wings and necks, slamming them into transport crates, and leaving many to suffer from untreated injuries and infections. Prompted by hidden-camera footage, law enforcement in North Carolina conducted a two-day raid at one of the facilities. Five Butterball employees were arrested and charged with criminal cruelty to animals. The prosecutions led to the first-ever felony conviction for cruelty to factory- farmed poultry in U.S. history. The following year, MFA investigated a dairy factory farm in Wisconsin that supplied Nestlé's DiGiorno Pizza brand. Undercover footage revealed cows beaten, stabbed, and dragged by tractors. After the video received widespread media attention, Nestlé, the largest food company in the world, met with MFA and implemented a far-reaching animal welfare policy.  2014–2016: Campaigns; New Initiatives; and Expansion to Brazil, Mexico, India, and Asia  Following progress with Nestlé, MFA targeted Leprino Foods, Great Lakes Cheese, and Saputo. After MFA investigations uncovered abuse in each of their supply chains, the companies released their own animal welfare policies. After six MFA investigations into Walmart's pork supply chain, three years of campaigning, and pressure from Bob Barker, James Cromwell, Ryan Gosling, and a slew of other celebrities, in May 2015 Walmart banned gestation crates, battery cages, and veal crates from its U.S. supply chains. The retail giant also pledged to end mutilations without painkillers, such as tail docking, castration, and dehorning. Top U.S. grocers Publix, Kroger, Albertsons, and SUPERVALU, along with the Retail Council of Canada, also pledged to ban intensive confinement of hens from their egg supply chains after MFA exposés or campaigns. In early 2016, MFA launched The Good Food Institute. The organization's mission is to create \\"a healthy, humane, and sustainable food supply.\\" The Good Food Institute provides strategic support to companies, promotes plant-based products, supports entrepreneurs, and educates grant-making institutions, corporations, and governmental bodies about plant-based and clean meat. Next, Perdue, one of the largest chicken producers in the world, announced a precedent-setting commitment to improving animal welfare after MFA investigated two contract farms in the U.S. supplying the company. The policy will reduce suffering for nearly 680 million birds annually. In the same year, MFA also set up operations in Brazil, Mexico, India, and Asia. An MFA investigator recorded footage from inside nine government-run slaughterhouses in Mexico. Pigs were dragged by their limbs to the killing floor and stabbed repeatedly. A tied-up cow suffered blows from a sledgehammer. A cornered pig was stabbed in the side with a large knife. The investigation drew attention from major Mexican media outlets Reforma, El Universal, and Proceso. Mexican actor Eugenio Derbez narrated an MFA video about the cruelty. In an online petition, Eugenio wrote, \\"I watched the video in horror as animals were tied up, shocked for no reason, brutally and repeatedly bludgeoned with sledgehammers, and then stabbed in the back of the head.\\" Back in the U.S., MFA was also part of a coalition of organizations that worked to pass the Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act in Massachusetts. The measure, passed in 2016, outlaws some of the cruelest farming practices and bans the sale of eggs, pork, and veal from animals raised in intensive confinement.  2017–Present  After the 2016 investigations, MFA worked with members of Mexico's congress to introduce federal legislation that would end the worst slaughter methods shown in the undercover video. The bill passed through two committees and the representative branch of Mexico's congress, with nearly unanimous support. As of October 2018, the bill was waiting on a senate vote. MFA launched its Conscious Eating program in Mexico and Brazil in 2017. Through the initiative, MFA works with large institutions—school districts, universities, and hospitals—to help them reduce the meat, dairy, and eggs they serve. Because of policy commitments that will reduce meat, dairy, and egg consumption by 20 percent, school districts, universities, and social assistance programs across Brazil and Mexico will serve about 26 million more vegan meals annually. Administrators and cooks at the institutions receive support, resources, recipes, and hands-on training from MFA. MFA has conducted multiple exposés inside factory farms in Brazil. The exposés have received media coverage in Brazil's largest daily newspaper, Folha de S. Paulo; major business magazine EXAME; and BuzzFeed News. In 2018, MFA staff in Brazil helped secure a historic commitment from Carrefour, the largest supermarket in Brazil, to eliminating small cages for hens. After MFA campaigns or discussions with MFA, dozens of other major brands in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and Brazil, including Burger King, General Mills, Jack in the Box, Pollo Pepe, Les Croissants, Loz Car, Grupo Alimento, Grupo Habib's, and Grupo Halipar, pledged to change how they treat animals. In the U.S., MFA worked with coalition partners on the Prevent Cruelty CA campaign to collect over 660,000 signatures of support for a ballot initiative to ban the production and sale in California of meat and eggs from animals confined in cages. The measure, Proposition 12, passed with 63% of the vote on the November 2018 California state ballot. In recent years, MFA has also pioneered investigations of factory farms and slaughterhouses using drones. MFA drones have exposed 35 factory farms, and views of the investigative videos have surpassed 22 million. A 2018 undercover investigation into California's driftnet fishing industry by MFA and a coalition of organizations showed dolphins entangled and drowned in driftnets, endangered species killed, and sharks cut apart and stabbed while still alive and conscious. The investigation received coverage by The Washington Post, the San Francisco Chronicle, NBC Bay Area, and many more outlets. Undercover footage influenced two legislative initiatives aimed at banning driftnets: a California state bill and a federal bill. A 2020 investigation focusing on the live export industry in Brazil revealed animals being confined in large ships in cramped conditions for weeks on end, often lying in and covered in their own feces. After arriving at their destination in the Middle East, cranes are used to hoist sick and injured animals out by their limbs. At the slaughterhouses, they are often slashed with knives and left to bleed to death, limbs are hacked off and throats stabbed.  Current programs   Exposés  MFA whistleblowers in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Brazil have documented animals intensively confined by the tens of thousands in sheds, mutilated without pain relief, beaten with metal bars, stabbed with knives, slammed into equipment, and ground up alive in industrial macerators.  Corporate engagement  MFA encourages companies to adopt animal welfare policies and works with large institutions to reduce meat, dairy, and eggs served. After two MFA investigations inside factory farms supplying Perdue, the company implemented an animal welfare policy that will reduce suffering for nearly 680 million birds a year. MFA has pushed hundreds of companies to implement reforms.  Legal advocacy  MFA's legal team defends whistleblower protections, holds animal abusers accountable, and champions laws that protect animals. The organization's work has resulted in new legal protections for animals; raids of farms by law enforcement; closure of facilities; criminal prosecutions of farm owners, managers, and employees for animal abuse; and defeat of anti-whistleblower legislation.  Social impact  Through social media and outreach, MFA raises public awareness about the suffering of farmed animals and promotes compassionate food choices. The organization runs ChooseVeg.com, a website dedicated to making plant-based eating easier and more accessible and offers one-on-one support for people interested in eating more plant-based foods.  Events   Hidden Heroes Gala  MFA hosts the Hidden Heroes Gala each year in downtown Los Angeles. The formal event honors MFA investigators and their supporters. Prominent celebrities attend each year in support. Past attendees include Joaquin Phoenix, Moby, Tony Kanal, Pamela Anderson, Mýa, Emily Deschanel, Kat Von D, Leona Lewis, Diane Warren, Emma Kenney, Evanna Lynch, Rose McGowan, Simon Helberg, Kevin Nealon, Daniella Monet, and Otep Shamaya.  Circle V  Circle V, the first all-vegan music festival celebrating animal rights, launched in 2016. A second event followed in 2017. Thousands showed up to enjoy vegan food vendors, retail pop-ups, and prominent speakers during the day. At night, musicians including Moby and Goldenvoice took the stage at the Fonda Theater in Hollywood. All proceeds from the event benefit MFA.

The dynamics and hammering runs of enormous chord clusters and constructively built pyramids of middle- range and lower-register notes cascade from his hands in bursts in the opening section of the lengthy \\"Reinforced Concrete.\\" Covering 65 minutes of this 72-minute set, this mammoth work allows all the wonderful elements of Taylor's sound architecture to be on display simultaneously... On disc two, recorded the next evening, Taylor is in duet with the great lyrical drummer Günter Sommer. Sommer has a true command of glissando, not only in his captivating and astonishing cymbal work (which opens the first of these three parts), but also his work on the floor tom, making it seem to dance in midair while holding down the fort. Taylor's interaction with him is one that is completely complementary. Taylor has been in dynamic, overpowering duos of force before — most notably with Sunny Murray — but what takes place here, perhaps because of its great energy, is something totally different. While this is free and unrehearsed, the relaxed notion of one player leading the other, following one another, and turning into and out of the angular structures feels effortless...

It was the opening film of the 66th Venice International Film Festival in September 2009. Plot The film recounts life in the Sicilian town of Bagheria (known as Baarìa in Sicilian), from the 1930s to the 1980s, through the eyes of lovers Peppino (Francesco Scianna) and Mannina (Margareth Madè). A Sicilian family depicted across three generations: from Cicco to his son Peppino to his grandson Pietro. Touching lightly on the private lives of these characters and their families, the film evokes the loves, dreams and disappointments of an entire community in the province of Palermo over five decades: during the Fascist period, Cicco is a shepherd who finds time to pursue his passion: books, epic poems, the great popular romance novels. In the days when people go hungry and during World War II, his son Peppino witnesses injustice by mafiosi and landowners. He becomes a communist. After the war, he encounters the woman of his life. Her family opposes the relationship because of his political ideas, but the two insist on marrying. They have children and raise their family. Subplots include one about a boy running an errand, a living fly locked inside a top, three rocks people try to hit in one throw, a man mutilating himself to avoid having to fight in the war, looting while the U.S. invades Sicily, making clothing from an American parachute, and Peppino's daughter calling her father a fascist for not allowing her to wear a mini- skirt. Running through the film is the main subplot, related to the history of the Italian left, especially the Communist Party, of which Peppino is a lifelong member. It charts his fight against injustice and eventual disillusionment in the face of corruption and compromise by his fellow politicians. Production The film was first announced during the 2007 Taormina Film Festival. The film was shot in both Bagheria, where Tornatore was born, and in an old neighborhood of Tunis, Tunisia; the latter location used because it could better depict what Bagheria looked like in the early 20th century. Language The film exists in two versions, the original in the local Baariotu dialect of Sicilian and the second dubbed in Italian. \\"Dialetto o doppiaggio?

It was also the Italian entry for the 2010 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film but did not get the nomination. Controversy In Italy, the Lega Antivivisezione (an anti-animal cruelty group) has condemned \\"'Baaria': bovino ucciso nel film, perché?\\" the actual on-screen killing of a cow visible in the Italian trailer. The animal was killed with an iron punch driven in the skull without any pain-relief technique, and then seen bleeding to death while some actors collect and drink its blood. Such a scene could not have been shot in Italy, because of laws against the unethical treatment of animals in media production. That part of the movie was filmed in Tunisia, where there are no such restrictions. Thereafter the ENPA (National Association of Animal Protection) demanded the immediate withdrawal of all copies distributed in theatres \\"to avoid the exposition of minors to such disgusting and fearful images\\", as the film is rated for an unrestricted audience. Again according to the ENPA, although the scene was filmed in Tunisia thus bypassing the Italian law, after application to the Minister of Justice, the prosecution can still take place in Italy. L'Enpa: ritirate «Baarìa» da tutte le sale - Corriere della Sera, 2 ottobre 2009 In October 2009, the ENPA started an international boycott campaign against the film and an online petition asking to revoke the designation of the movie as Italian entry to the Oscars. ENPA: Na all'Oscar insanguinato Linked 2013-11-05 Responding to these critics, director Giuseppe Tornatore clarified that the location in Tunisia was not intended to bypass Italian regulations, and that the animal was not specifically killed for the film. The scene was filmed in a local slaughterhouse and the killing was one of the many that take place there every day.

DeKalb Taylor Municipal Airport is located approximately west of Chicago. The airport is open 24 hours a day and is owned by the city of DeKalb.  History  During World War II, the U.S. Navy chose DeKalb, IL to be the site for the manufacture of drone TDR-1 aircraft and built an airport on the city's east side. This early airport consisted of an airfield and a large hangar that were fenced and guarded around the clock. DeKalb was chosen because Wurlizter, manufacturer of pianos, and known for its expertise in the production of wood products, was located there. Interstate Aircraft and Engineering Corporation (based in El Segundo, CA) assembled the planes at the new airport in DeKalb.Selig, Nicholas C., \\"Forgotten Chicago Airfields.\\" Charleston, SC: The History Press, 2014 -- Chapter on \\"DeKalb Airport\\" (ebook not paginated). Powered by two Lycoming O-435 engines of 220 horsepower (160 kW) each, the TDR-1 used a remarkably simple design, with a steel-tube frame constructed by the Schwinn bicycle company and covered with a molded wood skin.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_TDR%7Ctitle=Wikip article in \\"Interstate TDR.\\" The TDR-1s were remote controlled, had a TV camera in the nose, and a rotary dial was used to steer them from another aircraft. About two hundred drones were built, tested, and boxed at the DeKalb Airport and were shipped to the South Pacific, where they were used against the enemy during World War II.″Flying high: On the record ... with Tom Cleveland\\" in The Midweek, Dec. 16, 2014 -- https://www.midweeknews.com/2014/12/12/flying- high/a75tihu/ Interstate Aircraft went out of business in 1948, and at that time, the City of DeKalb purchased the airport runways and modest facilities. The city named it the DeKalb Municipal Airport. Willard Rue \\"Pete\\" Taylor was a DeKalb pilot, entrepreneur and airplane enthusiast. Even before the city of DeKalb had its own airport, Taylor ran two separate airfields in the cornfields around DeKalb. He also ran an airplane salvage business and sold airplane parts. As part of his flying service, he gave flying lessons, ran charter flights, flew his sick neighbors to hospitals, gave airplane rides to local children, and began crop dusting, which was a first for DeKalb. In 1948, Pete Taylor was named the first airport manager of the new DeKalb Municipal Airport, and he held this position until 1962. He was also granted a lease at the new airport and he moved his business, Taylor Flying Service, there.\\"For Pete's Sake: DeKalb Airport was 'Taylor' Made,\\" in \\"The Daily Chronicle,\\" July 15, 2001: De Kalb, IL, page 25. When the City of DeKalb acquired the airport in 1948, the buildings had not been in use since the end of World War II in 1945. The plumbing was in bad shape and the roofs in disrepair. Taylor handled repairs and improvements. He built 13 hangars and a repair shop, and even added a restaurant operated by his wife and fellow pilot, Ethel Taylor. Pete Taylor was a prominent DeKalb citizen, who served as a DeKalb Alderman, served on several city committees, and was influential in the airport's and community's history. After his death in 1983, in his honor, the city of DeKalb renamed the airport to DeKalb Taylor Municipal Airport. In 2001, Pete Taylor was inducted into the Illinois Aviation Hall of Fame. Interstate TDR parts at DeKalb Airport, 2017 In November 2019, Tom Cleveland, Airport Manager, working with the Prairie State Aviation Museum in Bloomington, IL, was able to secure a TDR-1 fuselage for the DeKalb Taylor Municipal Airport.

It is also known as a spiking hammer. Description Spike mauls are akin to sledge hammers, typically weighing from with -long handles. They have elongated double faced hardened steel heads. The head is typically over long to allow the user to drive spikes on the opposite side of the rail without breaking the handle. Some spike mauls have symmetrical heads, but most have a slightly longer thinner side and a shorter larger diameter side of equal weight. The long side allows a user to spike over abnormally tall rails, and to drive spikes down next to highway crossing planks. The shorter side provides more surface area which requires less accuracy for normal spiking. Ray Lyman Wilbur with first spike from Boulder Dam There are two typical patterns of spike mauls: * Bell: This is the more common variety. Bell spike mauls are mostly cylindrical in shape. * Standard: These have a square cross section, and a squared tapered end opposite the normal driving face. Handles are often ash or hickory, but lesser species of woods find their way into economy handles. Some mauls come with fiberglass handles as well. Specialized mauls exist with nonconductive handles for work on electrified track. Almost all spike mauls take a standard oval eye sledge hammer handle, which is frequently replaced through the course of heavy use. It is common practice in many locales to cut down the long handle to about . This makes the maul more convenient when used only to \\"set\\" spikes for a powered spiker. It also makes the \\"windmill\\" spiking technique more comfortable. Windmilling is when a user takes the maul handle with both hands locked and strikes the spike with repeated fast blows by swinging in a circular motion over the shoulder. The standard \\"wood chopping\\" motion is more comfortable and natural for most people. Use Regardless of the technique employed it is important to strike railroad spikes with the handle of the maul as close to horizontal as possible. This requires the user to bend over at the waist with every swing. If the user attempts to drive spikes while standing erect the spike will often bend and the maul head will begin to sit crooked on the handle. Shortly thereafter the maul handle will break. Because there are usually five (but sometimes six to eight) spikes driven per plate, and two plates applied per tie for each rail and because ties are placed so close together (usually, with ties on 16\\" centers)—thousands of spikes must be driven for each mile of track. When this was done manually, before the advent of pneumatic spiking machines, it was important that spikes be driven in rapidly. The standard, for a powerful and experienced spiker, was to drive the spike in with only three blows. It required great strength, and considerable stamina, to maintain that pace. Spike mauls are hardened tools. Occasionally the head may become upset or chipped. Heads are often reground on a bench grinder to remove nicks and metal flow. This practice is becoming less common as grinding can hide cracks and other defects. It is also possible to overheat the steel while grinding and remove some of the temper from the tool. Brands Brands of spike mauls include Slug-Devil, Tamco and Warwood.  References  * Tartman, E.E.

The building is distinguished by its facade, which is covered on three sides by blue and white tile of Puebla state. The palace remained in private hands until near the end of the 19th century. It changed hands several times before being bought by the Sanborns brothers who expanded their soda fountain/drugstore business into one of the best-recognized restaurant chains in Mexico. The house today serves as their flagship restaurant. The counts of the Valle de Orizaba began construction on the palace began in the 16th century. Descendants of this House of Orizaba covered the exterior of the palace in 1737 with the beautiful azulejos that are seen today. The building of the house Casa de los Azulejos depicted in a painting of 1858 during the Reform War. Casa de los Azulejos in the 20th century. The house is currently on the Callejón de la Condesa, between 5 de Mayo Street and what is now Madero Street. Madero Street was laid out in the 16th century and originally called San Francisco Street, after the church and monastery here. Later it was called Plateros Street, because of all the silver miners and silversmiths located here. From the 16th century through most of the colonial period, it was one of the most desirable streets in the city. Before 1793, there were two houses on this site, which were joined through the merger of two creole families of New Spain, when Graciana Suárez Peredo and the second Count del Valle de Orizaba married. Both families were very rich and held noble titles. The current structure was begun in 1793, with much the same dimensions and shape as it has today, but no tiles. The mansion was remodeled a bit later, adding the covering of blue and white tiles. This caused a sensation and gave the house its popular name. The tile facade Part of the facade, with azulejos There are two conflicting explanations of how this building got its current appearance. The more reliable version states that the fifth Countess Del Valle de Orizaba, who resided in Puebla, decided to return to the capital after her husband's death and remodeled the house with Puebla tile in 1737, to show the family's immense wealth. The other version is more colorful and tells of a son whose lifestyle caused his father to state that if he didn't change his ways he would \\"never build his house of tiles,\\" meaning that he would never amount to anything. As an act of defiance, the young man had the tiles put on when he inherited the house. These tiles cover the three exposed facades of the house on both levels. The rest of the house The peacock mural side of the courtyard. Courtyard at night. The most notable feature of the exterior are the blue and white tiles from Puebla that cover the building on three sides. Its windows, balconies and doors are framed in carved stone and French porcelain crowns on the Callejón de la Condesa and Madero Street facades. Inside, the main courtyard contains a fountain crowned with mosaics. The fountain is surrounded by highly decorated columns and topped with more French porcelain crowns as well as a stained glass roof that was added in the 20th century. Both the fountain and columns show some damage. On the second floor, the courtyard railings are made of copper; some made in China and some made in Mexico. The overall look to the courtyard is generally Baroque but also somewhat Oriental or Mudéjar. There are two large murals in the interior. The first one is a peacock mural by Romanian painter Pacologue done in 1919. In the main stairway is one of the earliest works by José Clemente Orozco titled Omniscience and done in 1925. The three symbolic figures appearing in it represent masculine values, with their feminine counterparts and Grace presiding over them both. According to chronicler and poet Salvador Novo, the torso in the center was later copied by Orozco in the work called Prometheus at Pomona College. On the second floor, the facade of what was the chapel has a set of gold frames bedecked with angels. There is also a collection of porcelain art. 18th to early 20th century Upper floor with doors The Counts of the Valley de Orizaba sold the house to attorney Martinez de la Torre in 1871. Upon Torre's death, the de Yturbe Idaroff family moved in, the last to keep the building as a private residence. Near the end of the 19th century, the house lost 90 square meters on the north side, to make way for 5 de Mayo Street. In 1881, the top floor was rented to the Jockey Club, the most exclusive social club between 1880 and 1914, and the lower floor housed an exclusive women's clothing store until 1914. During the Mexican Revolution, the Zapatista Army occupied the building for a short time. (No, the Zapatista Army did not occupy this mansion. In 1914, Sanborns was a drugstore located along Madero Avenue, but not in the House of Tiles. They did not move into their flagship location until 1918). In 1914, supporters of Porfirio Díaz held a banquet here in honor of Victoriano Huerta to celebrate the assassination of Francisco I. Madero after the Decena Trágica. An indignant Venustiano Carranza then seized the property in 1915, holding it for a number of months. The original owner, Francisco-Sergio de Yturbe managed to regain possession of the house before government-hired workers were able to finish remodeling it. Sanborns The colonial Baroque fountain of the palace, and the Sanborns restaurant Early in the 20th century, Frank Sanborn and his brother Walter opened a small soda fountain/drugstore on Filomeno Mata Street in the historic center of Mexico City, calling it Sanborns American Pharmacy In 1917, the two brothers saw the old mansion as a place to expand their business. They took two years to remodel it, putting a stained-glass roof over the main courtyard, putting in new floors and adding a peacock mural by Romanian painter Pacologue. A less important mural was painted by José Clemente Orozco in 1925 called Omnisciencia, solicited by his friend Francisco-Sergio (Paco) de Yturbe with the approval of the Sanborns brothers. A restaurant covered the inner courtyard and now dominates the establishment, which now is the flagship site for a chain of restaurants called Sanborns. The building was declared a national monument in 1931. Since the early 20th century, this Sanborns has been a popular place to have a meal in luxurious surroundings. The business has hosted painters, writers, actors, poets and revolutionaries. It was a symbol of a cosmopolitan atmosphere in the first half of the 20th century. The building was restored again between 1993 and 1995 after suffering a minor fire on the second floor. This project was aimed at preserving the elements of the building dating from the Baroque period, the French and Art Nouveau elements of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as well as the two murals, which had deteriorated considerably. Sanborns currently belongs to billionaire Carlos Slim. Gallery File:Fountain in the patio of the Casa de los Azulejos. 1901 or before. Henry G.

Prior to their deaths, the two had been living as a couple. Tioseco was a Filipino Canadian film critic and a film professor at the University of Asia and the Pacific. Recognized as an advocate of Southeast Asian cinema and as Philippine cinema's most passionate champion, he was named by the Philippine Star in 2005 as \\"one of the most important young people in the Philippines today\\" for his efforts to promote his nation's cinema. He was the editor of the Southeast Asian film journal Criticine. Bohinc was a Slovene film critic. Biographies Tioseco was born in the Philippines, but moved with his family to Canada in 1983. In 1996, he returned to the Philippines where he completed his college studies and worked in the family business. Tioseco credited the Lav Diaz film Batang West Side as having awakened his interest in Philippine cinema. He established a website, criticine.com, which was hailed in Filmmaker as \\"arguably the most influential, intelligent blog on Southeast Asian cinema\\". Tioseco became known for his efforts to expose foreign audiences to Philippine independent cinema. He helped organize established filmmakers in a failed attempt to seek reforms to the Metro Manila Film Festival. His 2008 article in Rogue, styled as a love letter to his partner Nika Bohinc, was later named by American film writer Gabe Klinger, writing in The Auteurs, as \\"the definitive manifesto on Philippine film [that] will soon become a canonical piece of critical writing.\\" Apart from Rogue, Tioseco contributed to The Philippine Star, Screen International and Senses of Cinema, as well as to catalogues of the Torino and Pesaro International Film Festivals.

Following his return to the United States, Ahr did pastoral work in the Archdiocese of Newark, where he first served as a curate at St. Mary's Church in Jersey City. He later served at St. Venantius Church in Orange until 1930, when he became a professor at Seton Hall Preparatory School. He was named professor of dogmatic theology (1933) and later rector (1947) at Immaculate Conception Seminary. On January 28, 1950, Ahr was appointed the seventh Bishop of Trenton by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following March 20 from Archbishop Thomas J. Walsh, with Bishops Bartholomew J. Eustace and Thomas A. Boland serving as co- consecrators. During his tenure, he increased the number of Catholics from 300,000 to 850,000, and founded 50 parishes and dedicated 100 new churches, 90 schools, and over 60 other buildings. He attended the Second Vatican Council from 1962 to 1965. He perceived a growing anti-clericalism in the United States, and opposed the Christian Layman's Experimental Organization. After twenty-nine years as bishop, Ahr retired on June 23, 1979; he was the longest- serving bishop of Trenton. He later died at Morris Hall Home of the Aged in Lawrenceville, aged 88. St. Thomas Aquinas High School in Edison was named in his honor from 1983 to 2019.

It aligned itself with the United Secretariat of the Fourth International.Robert J. Alexander, \\"Trotskyism in India\\" In 1968 the party recruited Gour Pal, formerly a leading figure in the Revolutionary Communist Party of India (RCPI), and significant numbers of trade unionists from the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP). The SWP opposed the Naxalite rebels, who they criticised for their isolation from the urban working class. It supported the independence movement in Bangladesh. The party opposed nominally revolutionary parties, such as the RCP and RSP, which participated in state governments. However, until early 1969, it co-operated with many of those parties in the Marxist League of Kerala. In the 1970 Kerala state elections it stood one candidate, but he received only 362 votes. In 1971, the SWP renamed itself the Communist League. Magan Desai became party secretary, and the journal was renamed Red Spark. During The Emergency of 1975-1977, it lost many long-standing members, some forming the Bolshevik Leninist Group. The party continued to operate into the mid-1980s.

Her life seemingly in shambles, she moves back in with her mother for the summer. She never knew the identity of her real father and her mother gives her the shocking revelation that her real father is alive and living in Templeton, but it is up to Willie to dig up the deep dark secrets of the small town and thus discover his identity. She excavates data from the local archives and from ancient books and letters. She gradually pieces together her family tree. While all of this is going on, Willie is concerned in the present about a possible pregnancy, about her sick friend she left back in California, about her mother's relationship with a local preacher, about her old acquaintance Zeke and of course about Glimmey, the kindly but now dead lake monster.

It is named after Michael O. Albertson, a professor at Smith College, who stated it as a conjecture in 2007;According to , the conjecture was made by Albertson at a special session of the American Mathematical Society in Chicago, held in October 2007. it is one of his many conjectures in graph coloring theory.. The conjecture states that, among all graphs requiring n colors, the complete graph K_n is the one with the smallest crossing number. Equivalently, if a graph can be drawn with fewer crossings than K_n, then, according to the conjecture, it may be colored with fewer than n colors. A conjectured formula for the minimum crossing number It is straightforward to show that graphs with bounded crossing number have bounded chromatic number: one may assign distinct colors to the endpoints of all crossing edges and then 4-color the remaining planar graph. Albertson's conjecture replaces this qualitative relationship between crossing number and coloring by a more precise quantitative relationship. Specifically, a different conjecture of states that the crossing number of the complete graph K_n is :\\\\textrm{cr}(K_n)=\\\\frac14\\\\biggl\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{n}{2}\\\\biggr\\\\rfloor\\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{n-1}{2}\\\\right\\\\rfloor\\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{n-2}{2}\\\\right\\\\rfloor\\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{n-3}{2}\\\\right\\\\rfloor. It is known how to draw complete graphs with this many crossings, by placing the vertices in two concentric circles; what is unknown is whether there exists a better drawing with fewer crossings. Therefore, a strengthened formulation of the Albertson conjecture is that every n-chromatic graph has crossing number at least as large as the right hand side of this formula.. This strengthened conjecture would be true if and only if both Guy's conjecture and the Albertson conjecture are true. Asymptotic bounds A weaker form of the conjecture, proven by M. Schaefer, states that every graph with chromatic number n has crossing number \\\\Omega(n^4) (using big omega notation), or equivalently that every graph with crossing number k has chromatic number O(k^{1/4}). published a simple proof of these bounds, by combining the fact that every minimal n-chromatic graph has minimum degree at least n-1 (because otherwise greedy coloring would use fewer colors) together with the crossing number inequality according to which every graph G=(V,E) with |E|/|V|\\\\ge 4 has crossing number \\\\Omega(|E|^3/|V|^2). Using the same reasoning, they show that a counterexample to Albertson's conjecture for the chromatic number n (if it exists) must have fewer than 4n vertices. Special cases The Albertson conjecture is vacuously true for n\\\\le 4. In these cases, K_n has crossing number zero, so the conjecture states only that the n-chromatic graphs have crossing number greater than or equal to zero, something that is true of all graphs. The case n=5 of Albertson's conjecture is equivalent to the four color theorem, that any planar graph can be colored with four or fewer colors, for the only graphs requiring fewer crossings than the one crossing of K_5 are the planar graphs, and the conjecture implies that these should all be at most 4-chromatic. Through the efforts of several groups of authors the conjecture is now known to hold for all n\\\\le 18.; ; ; . For every integer c\\\\ge 6, Luiz and Richter presented a family of (c+1)-color- critical graphs that do not contain a subdivision of the complete graph K_{c+1} but have crossing number at least that of K_{c+1}.. Related conjectures There is also a connection to the Hadwiger conjecture, an important open problem in combinatorics concerning the relationship between chromatic number and the existence of large cliques as minors in a graph.. A variant of the Hadwiger conjecture, stated by György Hajós, is that every n-chromatic graph contains a subdivision of K_n; if this were true, the Albertson conjecture would follow, because the crossing number of the whole graph is at least as large as the crossing number of any of its subdivisions. However, counterexamples to the Hajós conjecture are now known,; . so this connection does not provide an avenue for proof of the Albertson conjecture. Notes References . *. *. *. *.

The Council did not achieve ecumenical status in either East or West, but represented the first attempt of a pope to convene an ecumenical council independent of the Roman emperor. According to Andrew Ekonomou, the irony of the council was that the denunciation of the theology of Constantinople came from the \\"collaboration of a Greco-Palestinian pope and a Constantinopolitan monk employing a style of theological discourse whose tradition was purely Eastern.\\" Although Pope Martin I and Maximus the Confessor were abducted by Constans II and tried in Constantinople for their role in the council (Martin I being replaced as pope before dying in exile), their position was ultimately endorsed by the Third Council of Constantinople in 680. Planning Most members of the contemporary Roman clergy would have been too uneducated in theology to \\"grasp even the fundamental issues presented in the Monothelite controversy\\" due to centuries of decay in both religious and secular learning in the city. However, Rome had been the beneficiary of a brain drain of the Eastern empire, as Greek monks like Maximus the Confessor fled from Africa and the Middle East to Rome. Although the position of the council was substantially similar to that espoused by the Council of Chalcedon, \\"for the first time in well over a century, the church of Rome would be in a position to debate theological issues with Byzantium from a position of equality in both intellectual substance and rhetorical form.\\"Ekonomou, 2007, p. 116. The synod has its roots in a series of correspondence between Pope Theodore I and Maximus dating to 646, before the latter's arrival in Rome. The momentum for the council was almost extinguished when Patriarch Pyrrhus of Constantinople in late 646/early 647 denounced Monothelitism before the Roman clergy and laity. However, Pyrrhus changed his mind upon leaving Rome and arriving in Ravenna, and his successor Paul II of Constantinople was of the same mind. Emperor Constans II issued the Typos in 648 which prohibited any discussion of the issue of \\"one will and one energy, or two energies and two wills\\" in Christ. The Typos was viewed as an unacceptable threat to the legacy of Chalcedon, and thus hardened the determination of Theodore and Maximus to convene a council. Maximus and other monks from his order did all the \\"planning, preparation, and scripting\\" of the council. In contrast, there is little evidence that Pope Theodore did much to prepare for the council. Ecumenical status Pope Theodore I Maximus and Theodore did not regard the council as merely a meeting of the Roman church, but rather one \\"in the nature of a general or ecumenical council.\\" In a letter to a Cypriot priest, Maximus referred to the council as the \\"sixth synod, which through the divine inspiration of God set forth with all pure piety the doctrines of the holy Fathers.\\" Never before had the pope--or any prominent Christian leader-- challenged the authority of the Roman emperor alone to convene an ecumenical council.Ekonomou, 2007, p. 118. Even Athanasius, the virulent opponent of Constantius II's Arianism, had conceded this to the emperor he regarded as a heretic. The papacy also had long regarded ecumenical councils as the prerogative of the emperor; for example, when Pope Julius I convened a synod to rehabilitate Athanasius (condemned by the First Synod of Tyre), he defended the practice by claiming the synod was not meant to be general or ecumenical. Although the Council planned to send its canons to Constans II for ratification, there was little doubt that this would be viewed as \\"form without substance.\\" Theodore and Maximus were undoubtedly aware that they were \\"claiming nothing less than a revolutionary role for the Papacy.\\" Later popes would de facto repudiate this usurpation by allowing the emperor to convene the Third Council of Constantinople (680).Ekonomou, 2007, p. 119. Nevertheless, the Lateran Council of 649 constituted a watershed moment in the history of the primacy of the Roman pontiff. In an attempt to legitimize the council, neither Maximus nor Theodore attempted to innovate further with its methodology. Death of Theodore Pope Martin I, the first pope since 537 consecrated without imperial approval Pope Theodore died on May 14, 649, while preparing for the council.Ekonomou, 2007, p. 128. His death left Maximus without his patron and collaborator of the last three years and the \\"Papacy vacant at one of the most crucial times in the church's history.\\" The Roman clergy was faced with the impossible dilemma of finding a successor with the intellectual reputation to convene the Council who would not be denied the iussio of the emperor required for consecration.Ekonomou, 2007, p. 129. Due to the influence of Maximus, on July 5, 649, a deacon from Todi was consecrated as Pope Martin I, the first (and only) pope consecrated without imperial approval during the Byzantine Papacy. Although he was the former apocrisiarius to Constantinople and well respected in the East, Martin's election was an indisputable \\"battle cry against Constantinople.\\" Martin's stature and proficiency in Greek are attested to by Theodore's offer to appoint Martin as his personal representative to an earlier proposed synod in Constantinople. News of the impending council reached Constantinople as Martin prepared for it during the summer and fall, but the empire was \\"far too occupied with crises in the East to divert its attention.\\"Ekonomou, 2007, p. 131. Far from being spontaneous or extemporaneous, the council had been meticulously prepared and rehearsed over the previous three years. Despite Martin's nominal role in presiding over the council, none of its participants were ignorant of the decisive influence of Maximus in bringing it about. According to Ekonomou, the council was \\"in form as well as substance, a manifestly Byzantine affair.\\" Attendance The council was one of the first of the Lateran Councils, held in the Lateran Basilica (18th century facade pictured). The council was attended by 105 bishops, all but one from the western portion of the Byzantine Empire. Stephen of Dor, a Palestinian, was the only bishop whose See was not in Italy, Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, or Africa. Transalpine Europe, Spain, Greece, and Crete--despite lying within the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Rome--were not represented. One-fourth of the bishops were (as indicated by their names) likely of Eastern ethnicity or origin and thus probably Greek- speaking. The most prominent speaking roles were taken by (in descending order): Pope Martin I, Bishop Maximos of Aquileia, Bishop Deusdedit of Cagliari in Sardinia, Bishop Maurus of Cesena (in lieu of the archbishop of Ravenna), Sergius of Tempsa, Benedict of Ajaccio from Corsica, and Leontios of Naples (probably Leontios of Neapolis).Ekonomou, 2007, pp. 131-132; Derek Krueger, 1996, Symeon the Holy Fool: Leontius's Life and the Late Antique City, University of California Press. With the exception of Leontios, these were also the highest-ranking bishops present.Ekonomou, 2007, p. 132. The other ninety-eight bishops were essentially spectators, speaking (allegedly) in unison only five times, present only to bolster the council's claim to ecumenical status. Most of these were not well-educated enough to understand the complexities of the Monothelite controversy, with many knowing only that Monothelitism diverged from the Council of Chalcedon. Proceedings First session The council was convoked on October 5, 649, by the Greek cleric Theophylaktos, the principal notary of the Apostolic See, chief of the papal chancery and library, invoking the regnal year of the \\"august and most pious lord Constantine.\\"Ekonomou, 2007, p. 113. Pope Martin I then read a pre- prepared speech criticizing Monothelitism (a view held by the Patriarchs of Constantinople and Alexandria), denouncing the Ekthesis and Typos, and claiming for Rome the apostolic authority to weed out heresy. Martin quoted five Greek authors and two texts by Pope Leo I. The bishops of Aquileia and Cagliari spoke next, with remarks in much the same fashion, followed by representatives of the archbishop of Ravenna (himself absent). The entire convocation together assented to the previous remarks and recessed for two days. Second session The second session was convened on October 8 by Theophylaktos, who acknowledged the presence of late arrival Stephen of Dor, the papal vicar in Palestine, deputized to depose the Monothelite clergy of Sergius of Joppa.Ekonomou, 2007, p. 114. Bishop Stephen had arrived to deliver his own tract against Monothelitism, which was translated from Greek to Latin by papal notary Anastasios. The pope endorsed the speech upon its completion. A delegation of Greek abbots, priests, and monks (many of whom had been resident in Rome for years) were then admitted to the synod by Theophylaktos to present their own tract denouncing Monothelitism. As the bishop of Aquileia insisted, Theodoros translated these remarks into Latin. The tract was signed by thirty-six monks, among them Maximus the Confessor. The presence of these Easterners was designed to bolster the claim to ecumenical status of the council, anticipating that Constantinople would decry it as a regional assembly.Ekonomou, 2007, p. 134. Third session The third session took place on October 17 and consisted of Pope Martin responding to eleven excerpts of pro-Monothelite arguments by Theodore of Pharan's letter to Sergius of Arsinoe, and the citing of Eastern patristic sources in response.Ekonomou, 2007, p. 137. Martin appealed to a text of Cyril of Alexandria to rebut the arguments of Cyrus of Alexandria and Sergius I of Constantinople. Fourth session On October 19, the synod referenced the two letters of Gregory Nazianzen and a text by Anastasius Sinaita. Fifth session The last session of the Council took place on October 31, relying on florilegia from various Greek theologians. An excerpt from the Fifth Ecumenical Council on how to determine appropriate authority of texts was read at the suggestion of Leontios of Naples. Excerpts from fifty-eight texts by twenty-one authors (sixteen Greek and five Latin) were then read.Ekonomou, 2007, p. 138. After more texts were read, the Council proclaimed its adherence to the five previous ecumenical councils and condemned all those who disagreed. Al together 161 texts were quoted to the fifth session, 27 from Maximus's Tomus Spiritualis, with the vast majority originating in the East.Ekonomou, 2007, p. 140. Canons The council's acts and decrees were disseminated along with a papal encyclical claiming the \\"faith of the universal church\\" by virtue of having \\"exercised the collective power of the episcopate.\\" Of course, as Martin and Maximus were aware, all the previous councils regarded as ecumenical were convened by the emperor, not the pope.Ekonomou, 2007, p. 118. This encyclical itself was likely written by Maximus. Until recently, the predominant historical view was that the acts and proceedings of the council were written in Latin and then translated into Greek; Riedinger's more recent analysis of the texts suggests the opposite to be true.Concilium Lateranense a. 649 celebratum, ed. Rudolf Riedinger (Berlin, 1984). None of the council's prime movers were native Latin speakers, in particular Maximus the Confessor. The council's formal pronouncements amounted to 20 canons. Canons X and XI are the ones which specifically take up the subject of Christ's two wills and two energies, based predominately on Maximus's earlier disputation against Pyrrhus while in Carthage. The council's canons were promulgated widely in Western Europe, being sent to: bishop Amandus of Maastricht (to arrange for Sigebert III to convene a Frankish synod), bishop John of Philadelphia, bishop Theodore of Esbas in Arabia, bishop Anthony of Bacatha, archimandrite George of St. Theodosios's monastery, bishop Pantaleon of Dor, bishop Paul of Thessalonica, and the Christian communities of Jerusalem and Antioch. Aftermath A coin of Constans II, who had Pope Martin I and Maximus the Confessor abducted and tried in Constantinople The Roman public, independent of their distaste for Monothelitism, harbored a \\"growing resentment toward Byzantine political domination,\\" as expressed by the recent revolt of Mauricius against Isaac, Exarch of Ravenna.Ekonomou, 2007, p. 115. Two years later, Theodore I took the \\"bold and unprecedented act of presuming to depose\\" Patriarch Paul II of Constantinople, one of the leading proponents of Monothelitism.Ekonomou, 2007, pp. 114-115. Neither Theodore nor the Roman public desired political independence from Constantinople, but Theodore calculated that \\"the time was now particularly propitious to press Rome's position against Constantinople on the Monothelite question with even greater vigor.\\" Theodore did not believe his own authority ex cathedra nor his attempted deposition of the Patriarch to be sufficient to defeat Monothelitism; rather he hoped that the strength of the argument of the Council itself would win the day. Trial in Constantinople Within four years of the closing of the council, Pope Martin I and Maximus the Confessor were arrested and brought to Constantinople for trial, for violating the Typos's prohibition on discussing the subject.Ekonomou, 2007, p. 141. During his first trial in June 654 Maximus was asked by sakellarios Troilus where he had condemned the Typos. He replied \\"at the synod of Rome in the Church of the Savior.\\" Demosthenes exclaimed in reply that the Roman pontiff had been deposed. Maximus responded that the validity of the argument of the Council did not depend on the legitimacy of the pontiff that convened it.Ekonomou, 2007, p. 117. Martin I was exiled, eventually arriving in Tauric Chersonese in May 655.Ekonomou, 2007, p. 158. In an unusual move, a successor to Martin I, Pope Eugene I, was elected in 654 while he still lived and his name retained its anathema, escaping mention by even any of his successors for 75 years.Ekonomou, 2007, p. 159. Pope Eugene I normalized relations with Constantinople, and although he avoided pressing the issues of the Christological controversy, he ceremonially refused a letter from the Patriarch of Constantinople.Ekonomou, 2007, pp. 160-161.

As a result of Sir Nicholas' efforts in the months leading up to the outbreak of World War II in 1939, a total of seven locomotives transported 669 Czechoslovak children of mainly Jewish heritage from Prague to safety in Great Britain. Sir Nicholas' kindertransport efforts remained largely unrecognised until 1988, when they came to public attention after his wife found a scrapbook in their attic documenting the details. Only then did the individuals whom Winton arranged to have transported to safety as children learn the story of how they survived the Holocaust. As the majority of 'Winton's Children' (as they came to be known) were Jewish, it is believed this saved them from certain death had they stayed in Czechoslovakia. As of 2009, the direct descendants of Winton's Children numbered over 5000 people. The 2009 tribute Winton Train carried some of the individuals Sir Nicholas arranged to have transported to safety in 1939, along with their families, as it retraced the original kindertransport route taken by the trains on which they rode as children to safety in Great Britain 70 years earlier. The Winton Train departed on 1 September 2009, the 70th anniversary of the eighth, and intended last, train arranged by Winton to carry children to safety but was prevented from doing so due to the outbreak of World War II on that very day. It departed from Prague Main railway station and travelled through Germany and the Netherlands. After a transfer by ferry to Harwich, the journey resumed by train again to arrive in London's Liverpool Street station on 4 September, where it was met by the 100-year-old Sir Nicholas himself. For the journey across mainland Europe, the train was formed of period carriages and was hauled by historically authentic steam locomotives, while the British leg was hauled by 60163 Tornado, a brand-new, main-line British steam locomotive completed in 2008, along with carriages that were constructed in the 1950s. The tribute train was the centrepiece of a wider cultural awareness project known as 'Inspiration by Goodness', organised by the Czech government. Background Original Winton trains Between March and September 1938, the months leading up to the outbreak of World War II, Nicholas Winton, a 29-year-old British stockbroker whose parents were of German Jewish descent, organised eight trains to transport mainly Jewish Czech and Slovak refugee children from Czechoslovakia to homes in Britain. A statue of Sir Nicholas Winton by Flor Kent, unveiled in Prague Main railway station on 1 September 2009, the day of departure of the Winton tribute train. The girl is modelled on the granddaughter of a girl saved by one of Winton's original trains in 1939. In 1939, Winton cancelled a trip to a Swiss holiday resort to go to Prague, having heard of a growing refugee crisis resulting from the German occupation of Czechoslovakia from a friend. His friend was working in the British embassy for the British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia, which was already working to help adults escape from Czechoslovakia. When Winton learned that refugee children could not leave unless accompanied, he decided to arrange their evacuation to Britain. While the Winton evacuations later became known by the collective label of the children's Kindertransports, which were officially being organised elsewhere in other countries, no official Kindertransports had been arranged in Prague at that time. Winton organised the transfer of the children from the Nazi-appointed Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia to homes in Britain, in the process arranging the necessary bonds and permits for their departure, and finding the families in Britain who would receive the children. Winton and a team identified those children most at risk from the thousands of refugees driven south following the Nazi invasion of the Sudetenland. For each child to be accepted, British officials required a confirmed foster home and a £50 guarantee. Beginning in March, Winton organised eight trains, which in total transported 669 mainly Jewish children from Nazi occupied Czechoslovakia to Great Britain. A ninth and final train with 250 children on board was stopped at the last minute, due to the outbreak of the war. Only two children on this ninth aborted train survived the war.Tom Berman - September 2009Vera Gissing Interview According to Channel 4 News reporting on the 2009 Winton Train, \\"Sir Nicholas has said many times that the vision that haunts him most is the families waiting at Liverpool Street for the train that never arrived\\". The original trains left from Prague Wilson railway station (now Prague Main station). While most of the children were met by their new families at London's Liverpool Street station, some of the children got off the trains at Harwich, where they were placed with local families. Few if any of the Winton children saw their parents again. Winton's efforts did not come to public light until 1988, when his wife discovered papers in their loft, whereupon Winton began to publicly talk about his work, and he came to be known as the 'British Schindler', in comparison to Oskar Schindler. Sir Nicholas himself believed this was undeserved, because unlike Schindler, his life had never been in danger. Inspiration by Goodness project Sir Nicholas Winton in Prague, October 2007 A project to run a train in tribute to the original Winton trains was announced on 21 January 2008 as the Train Prague – London project, and the organisers were negotiating to have the train named after Sir Nicholas. The train was run by Czech Railways and sponsored by the Czech government, with the project being dedicated to their holding of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union from January to June 2009. The train was part of a wider project encompassing social and cultural events along the route to \\"inspire young people through the deeds of Nicholas Winton\\", and with the theme of \\"Inspiration by Goodness\\", it incorporated art, film, photographic and literary contests by university students and school children. The project was to follow on from the work of documentary film maker Matej Mináč about Sir Nicholas, including his new film project Nicky's Family. While travelling on the train, Mináč filmed scenes for a new version of the Winton story. The Czech Senate President Přemysl Sobotka said of the project that it \\"should warn against rising extremism and anti-Semitism in Europe and in the world\\". 2009 Winton Train Journey Locomotive No. 486.007, used in the Czech Republic (front) Locomotive No. 498.022, used in the Czech Republic (rear) Locomotive No. 41 018, used in Germany Locomotive No. 41 360, used in Germany Locomotive No. 01 1075 with the Winton Train passing Arnhem Velperpoort railway station in the Netherlands Locomotive No. 60163 Tornado arriving with the Winton Train in London Liverpool Street station, England The motive power for the train journey was provided by six different steam locomotives in total, two as a double-headed train in the Czech Republic due to the terrain, two in Germany, one in the Netherlands and one in Great Britain. The entire journey was scheduled to take four days, involving a European train leg, a crossing by the passengers on a ferry and a British train leg. It covered a distance of , of which was the train journey across mainland Europe. On 1 September the train departed Prague Main railway station. On this first day it travelled to the German city of Nuremberg, crossing the Czech - German border at Furth im Wald in the Bavarian Forest. The following day, the train was to travel across Germany to Cologne, via Frankfurt am Main. Instead of Frankfurt however, it travelled via Wiesbaden and the right bank of the River Rhine. On the third day, the train arrived on the North Sea coast at the Dutch ferry port, Hook of Holland, crossing the Dutch - German border at Emmerich am Rhein and passing through the Netherlands via Rotterdam. The passengers disembarked the train to cross the North Sea to Great Britain overnight on the Stena Line ferry Stena Britannica to Harwich, a port in the East of England on the country boundary between Essex and Suffolk. The British train journey formed the fourth day of the journey, travelling from Harwich to the London terminus of Liverpool Street station. On this final day the train departed Harwich International railway station at 09:12. It travelled via and , arriving at Liverpool Street station at 10:37 on Platform 10. Platform 10 was the platform number that the original Winton trains had used. Sir Nicholas, now 100 years old, met the train at Liverpool Street as guest of honour. \\" Also at Liverpool Street to meet the train was Štefan Füle, the Czech Minister for European Affairs, and a former Czech ambassador to Britain. Motive power and rolling stock Travelling through the Czech Republic from Prague to Furth im Wald, the train was double-headed by locomotives No. 486.007 and 498.022, with 486.007 leading as the train left Prague. No. 486.007, known as the Green Anton is a preserved steam locomotive built in 1936 and based in Vrútky, Slovakia, owned by Slovak Republic Railways (ŽSR). It is one of the :de:ČSD- Baureihe 486.0 class, and has a green livery. No. 498.022, which is one of the :de:ČSD-Baureihe 498.0 class, has a blue livery and is owned by Czech Railways, who store it at Libeň in Prague, Czech Republic. Travelling through Germany from Furth im Wald to Emmerich am Rhein, the train was hauled by locomotive No. 41 018. No. 41 018 is a preserved steam locomotive built in 1939 and based at the Augsburg Railway Park railway museum in Augsburg, Bavaria. It is one of the locomotive class DRG Class 41, and it is owned by DG München. As the train travelled through the Netherlands from Emmerich am Rhein to Hook of Holland, it was hauled by Locomotive No. 01 1075. No. 01 1075 is a preserved steam locomotive built in 1940 and based at the Stoom Stichting Nederland (SSN) railway museum in Rotterdam. Travelling through England (from Harwich to London), the train was hauled by No. 60163 Tornado, a British mainline steam locomotive built in 2008 by the A1 Steam Locomotive Trust, the construction of which began in 1994 and was completed in 2008. The passenger rolling stock for the European leg from Prague to Hook of Holland comprised nine historic railway carriages of Hungarian and German origin, with a capacity for 240 passengers. The train included the blue liveried state luxury saloon carriage of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, the first president of Czechoslovakia, which entered service on 7 March 1930, Masaryk's 80th birthday. For the British leg, behind Tornado and her maroon support coach, the train was headed by Pegasus, a cream and brown Pullman Bar Car incorporating the Trianon Bar, followed by the historic 1950s built red and cream The Royal Scot rake of British Railways Mark 1 passenger coaches of Riviera Trains. Pegasus was built in 1951 for the famous Golden Arrow boat train, and later rebuilt for heritage mainline use. Passengers The 2009 Winton train carried 170 passengers, including 22 of those originally rescued, who came to be known as 'Winton's Children'. Passengers included the first, second, or even third generation of descendants of the original children rescued by Sir Nicholas. The descendants of the children Sir Nicholas rescued had by 2009 grown to number 5,000 people. Passengers on the 2009 train also included Sir Nicholas's daughter Barbara. Other survivors who did not travel on the reunion train instead met it at Liverpool Street. Subsequent projects It was the hope of the project to follow up the 2009 Winton Train to London with other Winton Trains to other European cities, and for it to become a tradition. In May 2011, an exhibition entitled Winton's Trains opened in London at Liverpool Street station.

In 5th grade, at Edison School, Williams was allowed to assist a magician who gave a performance for the students. He was immediately fascinated. A teacher noticed he was good with his hands and showed him a Charlie McCarthy dummy doll. After graduation in 1951, William worked at SWS Chevrolet parking cars and then was hired at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. In the meantime, William continued to refine the art of projecting his voice. A fellow worker told him about a dummy that was for sale and William scraped up enough money to purchase the head, constructed the body himself, integrated it with a can of brown paint and thus was born \\"Freddie\\". After putting together a routine and perfecting his technique, they began to work the local club circuit.

Retrieved October 9, 2016. 1UP.coms Aaron Thomas called NBA 2K10 an \\"excellent basketball game\\" that is \\"full of nagging technical problems\\". The main technical issues Thomas experienced involved the game's framerate and online stability; he was also frustrated by some specific gameplay actions, such as referees taking too long to inbound the ball and frequent three-second violations. Thomas mainly praised the overall gameplay and presentation, but he also commended the addition of the MyPlayer mode, despite him thinking that progression in the mode was far too time-consuming. Matt Bertz of Game Informer gave the game a positive review, praising the improvements made over NBA 2K9. Specifically, Bertz praised the addition of the MyPlayer mode, the Association mode, the realistic nature and focus of the game, the overall gameplay and visuals, and the commentary. Tom Mc Shea from GameSpot cited the online options as a positive, calling them a \\"blast\\" to play, as well as the rewarding progression when playing through the MyPlayer mode. He did experience \\"lots of little\\" technical problems, however, and felt that because of the game's up upbeat tempo, which he did like, it was far to easy to score, thus eliminating strategy. In his review for GamesRadar, Martin Kitts commended the depth, gameplay, and presentation, saying that NBA 2K10 \\"almost perfectly\\" replicates the look of a televised NBA game, even if the visuals aren't quite as good as NBA Live 10. IGN concluded its review with: \\"With solid, fast paced gameplay and an excellent presentation that's easily the best the series has ever had, NBA 2K10 continues its strong pedigree of great basketball. While the presentation holds down the fort, the inclusion of the NBA Today and My Player modes, as well as the addition of the developmental leagues make an already good title even better. While the technical issues, such as the slowdown and the legacy problems with the AI and shooting are dismaying, they don't completely destroy the on-court experience, which is still strong enough to allow 2K to hold the basketball crown for yet another year.\\" By February 2010, 2K Sports announced that the game had sold more than two million copies across all platforms worldwide, an increase over NBA 2K9s sales numbers through that same period of time.Sarkar, Samit (February 2, 2010). \\"NBA 2K10 sells 2 million, brings back Mike Wang for 2K11\\".

It stars Donald Duck along with his three nephews; Huey, Dewey and Louie and Ajax, the killer gorilla. The 1930 Mickey Mouse cartoon The Gorilla Mystery has a similar plot involving a gorilla named Beppo who captures Minnie Mouse. Plot On a stormy night, Donald and his nephews overhear the radio announcer, Breckenridge, notify the listeners that a gorilla named Ajax has escaped from the city zoo. The nephews huddle in fright, and Donald laughs at them. As a prank, Donald frightens his nephews with gorilla hands to make it seem as if he is Ajax. The nephews view Donald from the keyhole and in order to get revenge on their uncle, they dress up in a gorilla suit and lay under Donald on the armchair (which Donald was sitting on to read a fairytale book), and take a bite out of Donald's lollipop while Donald is not noticing. Donald hears the crunching noise and discovers the mark left by the costume's sharp teeth in the lollipop and stares up at the fake gorilla, pale in fright, he runs away. The nephews pop up from inside the suit and laugh hysterically. At the same time, the real Ajax appears in front of the window and breaks into the house. Ajax then lets out an enormous roar and the nephews run away, still wearing the suit. Donald, who was hiding in a vase beneath an umbrella, spots them and their disguised gorilla suit and angrily chases them. Ajax appears in front of them and the triplets escape, but Donald momentarily assumes that Ajax is the triplets in disguise and grabs Ajax by the face to remove the \\"disguise\\" before spotting them. When Donald realizes that Ajax is not the fake gorilla (after opening his mouth and calling for them), Ajax roars at him and Donald almost faints until Breckenridge says that he can master any wild animal by looking them straight in the eye. Donald stares into Ajax's eye; however, he sees his pupil forming a tombstone reading \\"Here lies a dead duck\\". As Ajax is about to eat Donald alive, Donald shoves an umbrella into Ajax's mouth and escapes. Donald and his nephews are then shown quietly tiptoeing away to search for Ajax, but one of them accidentally spills some candle wax on Donald's behind and later burns Donald's back. Donald's head briefly turns into a boiling kettle, and he angrily drives the triplets away and gets his hand burnt on a doorknob due to unknowingly holding the candle's flame under it. Later, Donald searches for Ajax on his own, and unfortunately crosses paths with the gorilla, who was standing on his head, and Donald does not even realize his presence until his tail feathers hint him, and Ajax starts chasing Donald. Ajax chases Donald through his house, causing a lot of havoc of the house, like scraping a column, crashing through the ceiling to the bedroom after Donald tricks Ajax into running up a ladder at the end of the stairs, and destroying wooden planks from a really long table. Ajax pushes the table to try to crush Donald and then tries to bite Donald's tail, but it pokes him in the eye. Amid all these things, with the help of Breckenridge, the nephews use tear gas in an attempt to stop Ajax, and it successfully subdues Ajax, but affects Donald as well. Tearing up, Ajax and Donald console one another and crying as the cartoon ends.

He killed himself following his trial. Conspiracy The actual name of this prince is unknown, \\"Pentawer\\" being a pseudonym given to him on the Judicial Papyrus of Turin.James Henry Breasted, Ancient Records of Egypt, Part Four, Chicago 1906, § 421 He was to be the beneficiary of the harem conspiracy, probably initiated by his mother Tiye, to assassinate the pharaoh.Pascal Vernus, Affairs and Scandals in Ancient Egypt, Cornell University Press 2003, pp.108f. Tiye wanted her son to succeed the pharaoh, even though the chosen heir was a son of the queen Tyti. According to the Judicial Papyrus, Pentawer was among those who were made to stand trial for their participation in the conspiracy. He was forced to kill himself: James Henry Breasted argued that Pentawer \\"was in all probability only an unfortunate tool\\" in the conspiracy. Susan Redford speculates that Pentawer, being a noble, was given the option to kill himself by taking poison and so be spared the humiliating fate of some of the other conspirators who would have been burned alive with their ashes strewn in the streets. Such punishment served to make a strong example since it emphasized the gravity of their treason for ancient Egyptians who believed that one could only attain an afterlife if one's body was mummified and preserved — rather than being destroyed by fire. In other words, not only were the criminals killed in the physical world, but they also did not attain an afterlife. They would have no chance of living on into the next world, and thus suffered a complete personal annihilation. By killing himself, Pentawer could avoid the harsher punishment of a second death. This could have permitted him to be mummified and move on to the afterlife. A recent study of the remains of 'Unknown Man E' which are a candidate for his suggest that he died by strangulation or hanging. If the remains indeed are his, then he would have been about 18-20 years old at the time of his death. Probable mummy In recent times, the Egyptologist Bob Brier has revived the old hypothesis that the famed mummy of the \\"Unknown Man E\\" found in the Deir el-Bahari cache (DB320) might, indeed, be Pentawer.The Mystery of Unknown Man E, by Bob Brier, 2006, Archaeological Institute of America. The mummy is very unusual because it appears to have been embalmed quickly, without removing the brain and viscera, and to have been placed in a cedar box, the interior of which had to be crudely hacked to widen it. Brier hypothesizes that Pentawer was mummified very rapidly and placed in an available coffin, likely by a relative, in order to give him a proper burial.Brier, Bob, \\"Unknown Man E, A Preliminary Examination\\", Bulletin of the Egyptian Museum, Volume 3, Supreme Council of Antiquities, American University in Cairo Press, 2008, pp.23-7. Subsequent DNA analysis supports the theory that the mummy was a son of Ramesses as they both share the paternal Y-DNA haplogroup E1b1a and half their DNA.

Merrie Melodies animated short directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on August 10, 1940. It features a little ghost (bearing a resemblance to Casper the Friendly Ghost) who is inexperienced at haunting houses and whose \\"suit/sheets\\" resemble the typical footy pajamas with the \\"trap door\\" that were popular in the era. The little ghost is silent, goes to a haunting job interview and is terrorized by a bigger ghost. Plot The short starts out in the little ghost's house as he is reading a book titled How To Haunt Houses showing various recommended haunting positions that are usually successful for ghosts. He tries out a few of the positions by posing and then reads the Haunt Ads in the Saturday Evening Ghost (dated Saturday December 13, 1939). He comes across a haunting job that does not require experience at the address of 1313 Dracula Drive that he likes. He changes from his white \\"suit/sheets\\" into a new light blue colored \\"suit\\" (he also puts on a white hat) and is invisible for the interim between changing \\"suits\\". Even though he can pass through closed doors like an ordinary ghost, he prefers opening them while passing through. He arrives at the house at 1313 Dracula Drive, which is on a mountain, and tries out for the house-haunting job, but ends up getting terrorized by a bigger ghost interviewing him for the position. The ghost terrorizes him by yelling Boo!\\", sending him a Ghostal Telegraph that says \\"Boo!\\", and dropping a lit firecracker that resembles an M-80 that the little ghost just barely runs away from. The bigger ghost's plans backfire on him when the fuses of the fireworks he put in his \\"back pocket\\" get lit by the lit match he dropped. He is sent flying throughout the house after the little ghost and ultimately into a well somewhere outside the building.Ghost Wanted (1940) - IMDb Other appearances The animated short was shown on TBS from 1987 to 1992 as a segment of the Tom & Jerry Halloween Special. The young ghost has also made appearances as an enemy in numerous video games. His appearances include The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle series for NES and Game Boy as well as the NES game Bugs Bunny's Birthday Blowout.

Construction and commissioning Bassett was laid down as the Buckley-class destroyer escort USS Bassett (DE-672) on 28 November 1943 by the Consolidated Steel Corporation at Orange, Texas, and launched as such on 15 January 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Margaret Bassett, mother of the ships namesake, Ensign Edgar R. Bassett. She was reclassified as a Charles Lawrence-class high-speed transport and redesignated APD-73 on 27 June 1944. After conversion to her new role, the ship was commissioned on 23 February 1945 with Lieutenant Commander Harold J. Theriault in command.  Service history  World War II Following shakedown in the Chesapeake Bay and off Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, which she completed on 9 April 1945, Bassett underwent post-shakedown repairs at Norfolk, Virginia, before departing for World War II service in the Pacific. Reporting to the United States Pacific Fleet for duty on 1 May 1945, Bassett carried out amphibious warfare training exercises out of Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, before escorting convoys to places which included Eniwetok in the Marshall Islands, Guam in the Mariana Islands, Ulithi Atoll in the Caroline Islands, Hollandia in New Guinea, and ultimately Leyte in the Philippine Islands. Upon reporting at Leyte for duty with the Commander, Philippine Sea Frontier, Bassett delivered mail and passengers to various ports in the Philippine archipelago and to Brunei Bay, Borneo. After returning to Leyte on 26 July 1945, Bassett conducted antisubmarine warfare patrols off Borneo. On 2 August 1945 while carrying out that duty north of Leyte, she received reports of large groups of survivors some 200 nautical miles (370 kilometers) away and altered course to investigate. Within 10 hours, Bassett joined in the rescue of survivors from the heavy cruiser USS Indianapolis (CA-35), which had been torpedoed and sunk by the Japanese submarine I-58. After reaching the scene of the tragedy, Bassett rescued 154 Indianapolis survivors in a four-hour search and took them to the fleet hospital before returning to Leyte. Postwar Following a brief voyage to Hollandia, Bassett was assigned to Amphibious Group 8, to take part in the occupation of Japan, which followed the surrender of Japan on 15 August 1945. She supported the landings at Wakayama, near the key port of Kure, and at Nagoya, on Honshu, before serving as a harbor entrance control ship at Nagoya. Detached from these duties on 18 November 1945, Bassett participated in Operation Magic Carpet, the massive homeward-bound movement of veterans, embarking passengers at Sasebo, Japan. Upon returning these men to the United States West Coast, Bassett tarried briefly at San Diego, California, before shifting her area of operations to the Atlantic Ocean. Following repairs at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Bassett was assigned to the Florida Group of the 16th Fleet, later the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Decommissioned on 29 April 1946, Bassett was laid up at Green Cove Springs, Florida, and remained inactive there for four and a half years. 1950s Recommissioned on 7 December 1950 with Lieutenant Commander Demetrius J. Vellis in command, Bassett proceeded to Jacksonville, Florida, for repairs at the Merrill Stephens Drydock and Repair Company. After reporting for duty to the Commander, Amphibious Force, United States Atlantic Fleet, on 19 December 1950, Bassett departed for Norfolk. Over the next seven years, Bassett operated out of Norfolk with the amphibious arm of the Atlantic Fleet. Her initial assignments took her to Havana, Cuba; St. Thomas in the United States Virgin Islands; and Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico. They also included cold- weather reconnaissance work carried out in cooperation with United States Marine Corps units. She escorted convoys, participated in amphibious landings, and performed plane guard duty. In June 1952, Bassett began her first midshipmen training cruise, during which she visited Greenock, Scotland, and several French ports. In 1953, Bassetts duties took her to Morehead City, North Carolina; Vieques Island, Puerto Rico; St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands; and the British West Indies. She stood plane guard duty for the escort aircraft carrier USS Mindoro (CVE-120) during October 1953. In June 1954, unrest in Guatemala prompted her despatch to Central America to observe the situation. Upon her return from Caribbean duty, Bassett carried out another midshipmen training cruise, this time to Canada and Puerto Rico. Bassett completed repairs at the Charleston Naval Shipyard at Charleston, South Carolina, during the summer of 1955 and returned to active duty on 6 September 1955. She cleared Charleston on that day and stood into Guantanamo Bay on 25 September 1955. Bassett spent one night there before getting underway to search for a Navy hurricane-hunting plane lost in the Caribbean while tracking Hurricane Janet. However, her five-day hunt failed to locate the plane or its crew. Bassett next received orders to proceed to British Honduras to assist victims of Hurricane Janet. En route, she received orders directing her to put into the port of Tampico, Mexico, where raging floods caused by the hurricane had engulfed 32,000 square miles (82,979 square kilometers) of Mexican territory, causing loss of both lives and property. While at Tampico, Bassett assisted light aircraft carrier USS Saipan (CVL-48) in carrying out relief work and rendered invaluable service herself by bringing supplies to the needy people along the swollen Rio Panuco and by rescuing marooned people. Upon the completion of her hurricane relief mission, Bassett returned to Guantanamo Bay, arriving there on 17 October 1955. Finishing her training evolutions by 18 November 1955, she departed for the United States and reached Norfolk in time for her men to enjoy Thanksgiving with their families. Following amphibious transport training at Norfolk in late November and early December 1955, Bassett then carried out amphibious operations in the Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek area at Virginia Beach, Virginia, into January 1956. Later that month, she operated with elements of the United States Armys 77th Special Forces. Bassett spent the remainder of February and the early part of March 1956 at Little Creek or in nearby waters. On 20 March 1956, Bassett departed for the Mediterranean and her first deployment with the United States Sixth Fleet. Passing the Rock of Gibraltar on 1 April 1956, Bassett began several months of operations in the Mediterranean, making goodwill port visits and engaging in amphibious exercises. She ranged the length and breadth of the Mediterranean from Gibraltar to Athens, Greece, and Izmir, Turkey, and from the Isle of Rhodes to the French Riviera. In the course of her training evolutions, Bassett served as primary control ship for the landing practice at Porto Scudo, Sardinia, and Dikili, Turkey, in addition to supporting her own underwater demolition unit in each instance. After the seven-month Mediterranean deployment, Bassett reached Little Creek on 18 October 1956 and spent the remainder of the year there engaged in upkeep and post-deployment repairs. In January 1957, she commenced local operations out of Little Creek in the Virginia Capes operating area. Later on, she extended the range of her operations from the immediate vicinity of Little Creek to as far away as La Guaira, Venezuela. Her other ports of call included the familiar ones of Guantanamo Bay and Vieques Island, as well as Coco Solo, Panama, and Morehead City, North Carolina. Bassett reported to the Norfolk Group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet on 26 August 1957 for inactivation. Final decommissioning and disposal Bassett was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Norfolk on 26 November 1957. She remained in reserve for over nine and a half years before her name was stricken from the Navy List on 1 May 1967. Colombian Navy service Towed from New York City to Boston, Massachusetts, early in July 1968, Bassett was turned over to Colombia under the Military Assistance Program. She was commissioned at Boston into the Colombian Navy as ARC Almirante Tono (DT 04) on 6 September 1968 and, after shakedown and post- shakedown repairs, sailed for the naval base at Cartagena, Colombia. Almirante Tono operated with the Colombian Navy through the mid-1970s.

He frequently represented Microsoft and Xbox Live in various media, including on Larry Hryb's \\"Major Nelson Radio\\" Xbox-related podcast, to discuss security and policy issues. Prior to joining the Xbox team at Microsoft, Toulouse was the head of communications for security response with the Microsoft Security Response Center. Career Toulouse worked at Microsoft starting in April 1994. On February 3, 2012 he announced his departure from Microsoft, stating > \\"... This is a positive thing.

His first exposure to communications during a security response crisis was during the spread of the SQL Slammer computer worm in January 2003, where he was asked by Security Business Unit Vice President Mike Nash to handle creating a way for affected users to determine whether or not they had a vulnerable instance of SQL Server installed. Toulouse later handled public relations for malware outbreaks such as Blaster, Sasser, and Zotob, as well as the Windows Metafile vulnerability. Toulouse suggested in a personal blog entry in 2006 that Apple's products enjoyed good security due to their small market share and that the company would have to focus on hiring a \\"Security Czar\\" at some point. When Toulouse left the MSRC, he was praised by several notable security journalists for his candor and honesty about Microsoft's security challenges. Xbox Live In August 2007, Toulouse joined the Xbox Live Services group as Lead Program Manager for Enforcement, describing his role at the time as \\"Helping to make sure the Live experience is a safe and enjoyable one for users.\\" Over the next years he expanded his role to include policy and enforcement for the Xbox Live and Zune Social services, building out a team of worldwide \\"enforcers\\" to implement the rules of the Xbox Live service. Toulouse was promoted to Director for Policy and Enforcement for Xbox LIVE in September 2009. During his time as a co-host of the Xbox podcast \\"Major Nelson Radio,\\" Toulouse was the public face for the rules governing behavior on the Xbox Live service and often explained and clarified policies. Sexuality identification on Xbox Live In February 2009, while Toulouse was head of policy for Xbox Live, Microsoft attracted adverse attention for the gaming service's policies towards members' expression of their sexual identity. While the service allows for self-expression of sexual orientation in voice chat during games, at that time Xbox Live banned all mention of orientation — including of heterosexuality — in Gamertags and in profiles. Widespread criticism of this practice led to Toulouse publicly vowing to change the policy to allow for expression of sexual orientation. Changes announced in March 2010 permit Xbox Live members to express sexual orientation in their Gamertags and profiles. The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) praised Toulouse for his work with their group in combating homophobia in online gaming. Performances Toulouse was a special guest at W00tstock 2.0 in Seattle, Washington and W00tstock 2.1 in Portland, Oregon. He read from \\"The Book of Enforcement\\".

History During the lumbering era of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the area around the Jordan River was a prime spot for lumbering. The East Jordan & Southern's main purpose of creation was to haul the harvested lumber from the Hitchcock lumber camp to Bellaire where the logs would be transported by the Chicago and West Michigan Railroad to various sawmills. Along with the lumber industry, the East Jordan Iron Works also provided a large sum of the railroad's profits. After the lumber ran out during the 1920s, the railroad became more and more reliant on the industry in East Jordan and Bellaire for business. This was so until the East Jordan Iron Works decided to stop using the railroad in 1962, and the line was abandoned. Two crossroads on the line south and west over the ancient sand dunes to Bellaire were named Marble, and Mount Bliss Most likely these were flag stops so a passenger would have to wait in the general store until the train whistled and came chugging into town. Everyone in the store that was waiting for the train would scurry out and pay their fare and ride the train. Many of the school children commuted on this train for high school classes and the families would have paid a fee for attending the East Jordan High School rather than attend small country schools. The railroad today The railroad tracks are gone, but most of the ties of the former railroad grade are still intact. As for Hitchcock, many small foundations can be found where the camp once stood. The Depot in East Jordan also still stands.

Bassett (March 10, 1914 – June 4, 1942) was a United States Navy officer who received the Navy Cross posthumously for his actions in combat during World War II. Biography Edgar Rees Bassett was born in Philadelphia, on 10 March 1914. He enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve at New York City as a seaman second class on 13 February 1940. After flight training, he was commissioned as an ensign on 20 May 1941. He joined Fighting Squadron 42 aboard the aircraft carrier on 9 June 1941 as the squadron was preparing for its first Neutrality Patrol cruise in the Atlantic Ocean aboard Yorktown. Bassett was considered one of the more colorful characters among the fighter pilots of Fighting Squadron 42, and remained associated with Yorktown for the rest of his life. Bassett was noted more than once for his aggressive performance of duty in the first few months of World War II, especially for his strafing of Japanese gun emplacements and barges during the aircraft carrier raid on Lae and Salamaua, New Guinea, on 10 March 1942. During the Battle of the Coral Sea, which took place between 4 and 8 May 1942, Bassett shot down a Mitsubishi F1M2 \\"Pete\\" floatplane over Tulagi in the Solomon Islands during the Yorktown air group attack on Japanese shipping there on 4 May and strafed the Japanese destroyer Yuzuki as she fled Tulagi harbor. On the morning of 7 May, he flew one of the fighters that protected Torpedo Squadron 5 in its attack on the Japanese aircraft carrier Shōhō. That same evening, he helped to disperse a group of Japanese dive bombers and torpedo planes in the vicinity of the Yorktown task force. On the morning of 8 May, he flew combat air patrol over Task Force 17 and assisted in the downing of one Japanese plane during Japanese attack on Yorktown. Assigned to Fighting Squadron 3 aboard Yorktown along with several other Fighting Squadron 42 pilots just before the Battle of Midway, Bassett flew one of the six Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters covering Torpedo Squadron 3 in the attack on the aircraft carriers of the Japanese Mobile Force on the morning of 4 June 1942. When the Japanese combat air patrol swarmed over the torpedo planes and their escorting fighters, Ensign Bassett was shot down in flames at the outset and killed. Awards Ensign Bassett was awarded the Navy Cross for \\"extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty\\" during the Battle of the Coral Sea. He also was awarded the Air Medal more than once for his aggressive performance of duty in the first few months of 1942, especially for his actions during the March 1942 raid on Lae and Salamaua. Commemoration The U.S. Navy destroyer escort USS Bassett (DE-672) was named for Ensign Bassett.

History Egg producer's concern over the volatility of prices due to overproduction during the early 1960s was the impetus for the creation of UEP.Starr 1975, p. 151. To combat these intermittent price fluctuations, producers began by coordinating egg production through several regional marketing associations, including the Northwest Egg Producers (NWEP); the Western Egg Company (WESTCO); the Southwest Egg Producers (SWEP); the National Egg Company (NECO), which focused on the Southeastern United States; and the Northeast Egg Marketing Association (NEMA).Hanke 1974, p. 628-680. This approach was unsuccessful in coordinating interregional egg production, and as a result, instability continued. Hence, NWEP, WESTCO, SWEP, NECO, and NEMA came together to form UEP as the first national association of egg farmers on October 19, 1968.Hanke 1974, p. 675-676. UEP's five member associations tasked the new organization with three primary objectives, including 1) monitoring and controlling egg prices, 2), providing national leadership to American egg farmers and 3) developing marketing plans. UEP made great strides in accomplishing each of these tasks within its first decade in existence. In May 1971, UEP helped establish the nonprofit corporation responsible for determining and setting the market value of eggs known as the Egg Clearing House, Inc. (ECI).Jasper 1974, p. 342-345. The creation of this organization effectively shifted the responsibility of monitoring and controlling egg prices from UEP to the ECI. In April 1973, UEP acted on its marketing responsibility by creating the American Egg Board, which encourages the consumption of eggs and egg products through the publication of nutritional information and advertising.Wilhelm 1974, p. 504-534. In 1978, UEP hired the law firm of McLeod, Watkinson & Miller to represent UEP's interests in Washington D.C.Smith 2007, p. 19. and founded the United Egg Association Political Action Committee (EggPAC), which gave contributions to candidates running for state and national offices.Skinner 1976, p. 54. UEP's first foray into creating animal welfare standards occurred during the 1980s. In June 1982, in collaboration with the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), UEP developed a set of animal welfare guidelines and published them in a pamphlet entitled “Recommended Guidelines of Husbandry Practices for Humane Handling.”Lovenheim 1983, p. 16-17. The following year, UEP returned to their primary objectives by setting up a subsidiary organization for companies that break and further process eggs, known as United Egg Association Further Processors (UEAFP).UEP 2004, \\"UEA Further Processors.\\" For the rest of this decade, UEP focused primarily on managing its many subsidiaries, dealing with consumer health concerns,Watson 1985.Eshleman 1987, p.

Response to letter writing campaign A spokesperson for the UEP was asked to comment by the Associated Press after the animal rights group Mercy for Animals sent letters of protest to the fifty largest grocers in the US demanding they include a label on egg cartons that says, \\"Warning: Male chicks are ground-up alive by the egg industry.\\" The UEP called the campaign \\"almost a joke,\\" and said that the group's ultimate aim was to stop egg consumption altogether. To coincide with the letter campaign, Mercy For Animals released a video showing male chicks being killed on the production line of an Iowa hatchery by being fed, alive, into a grinder. The hatchery claimed that the procedure, known in the industry as instantaneous euthanasia was in line with guidelines set up by the UEP.

Weirdale is about 48 km northeast of the City of Prince Albert along Highway 55.  History  Weirdale was founded between 1929 and 1931. It was given life because of the Canadian Pacific Railway, which opened a new frontier on the Canadian Prairies. When the pioneers arrived in the area, they cleared out the thick forest and muskeg by hand creating rich farmland. The pioneers had large families that lived on every quarter of farmland. In turn, these large families brought the population to the area. In the early part of 20th century, transportation was much slower than it is today so it was much more difficult to travel long distances. Because of the difficulties in travelling, many small communities had to become self- sustaining in order to survive. At one point, Weirdale housed a hospital, school, flour mill, puffed wheat factory, and a lumber yard as well as numerous other small business that sustained the community. As transportation advanced and became more efficient, which was aided by the construction of modern highways, small villages across the prairies began to die economically.Village of Weirdale History.

After signing a contract with A.C. Milan at the age of 19, his career never developed, as he played for mostly in the lower leagues of his country – which included spells in amateur football – and abroad. In Spain, he played in four different divisions, but never in La Liga. Club career Born in Santa Eulàlia de Ronçana, Barcelona, Catalonia, Peñaranda was brought up at FC Barcelona, where he played alongside the likes of Gabri, Gerard or Carles Puyol. In the summer of 1998 he and his family moved to the Balearic Islands, and the 17-year-old signed with local RCD Mallorca, being assigned to its reserves in the second division where he played with another future Spanish international, Diego Tristán; he was not, however, very successful, dealing with some injuries. In September 2000, A.C. Milan won the race with Real Madrid, signing the young Peñaranda for eight years. Barcelona fought for several weeks for the player's rights over him, so the transfer license was delayed, and he appeared only for the Primavera, adding two first-team friendlies; midway through that season he returned to his country and was loaned to Sporting de Gijón B, in the third level. Subsequently, Peñaranda began a series of unassuming loans: in quick succession, he appeared for Granada CF (one match played, missing a penalty kick in the 89th minute with the score at 0–0), CE Sabadell FC and Palamós CF. He was brought to the last club as an emerging star by owner/manager Dmitry Pietrman, with the pair quickly feuding, which led to the player's release. In the 2002–03 campaign, Peñaranda would have his first and only taste of top level football, with Portugal's C.D. Santa Clara. With the Azores side eventually suffering Primeira Liga relegation, his input consisted of one game – 20 minutes, in a 5–0 away loss against Vitória de Guimarães– and he returned to Spain in the summer, playing for division three's CD Toledo. From there onwards, Peñaranda's career went downhill as he never settled in a team and often changed countries, until his definite release by Milan in June 2006: abroad, he played in Mexico for C.F. Pachuca, Bosnia and Herzegovina for FK Slavija Sarajevo and in Azerbaijan with Neftchi PFK, appearing in the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League preliminary rounds with the latter.

This list of rogue waves compiles incidents of known and likely rogue waves – also known as freak waves, monster waves, killer waves, and extreme waves. These are dangerous and rare ocean surface waves that unexpectedly reach at least twice the height of the tallest waves around them, and are often described by witnesses as \\"walls of water\\". They occur in deep water, usually far out at sea, and are a threat even to capital ships and ocean liners.  Background  Anecdotal evidence from mariners' testimonies and damages inflicted on ships have long suggested rogue waves occurred; however, their scientific measurement was positively confirmed only following measurements of the \\"Draupner wave\\", a rogue wave at the Draupner platform, in the North Sea on 1 January 1995. During this event, minor damage was inflicted on the platform, confirming that the reading was valid. In modern oceanography, rogue waves are defined not as the biggest possible waves at sea, but instead as extreme sized waves for a given sea state. Many of these encounters are only reported in the media, and are not examples of open ocean rogue waves. Often a huge wave is loosely denoted as a rogue wave, when it is not. Although extremely large waves offer an explanation for the sudden, inexplicable disappearance of many ocean-going vessels. However, although this is a credible explanation for unexplained losses, the claim is contradicted by information held by Lloyd's Register.The story that \\"200 large ships lost to freak waves in the past two decades\\" was published in The Times (May 2006). One of the first press releases, issued by the European Space Agency (cited at the page bottom), reported \\"200 large ships of 600 ft long or more in the past two decades sunk without a trace\\". At the time the claim was made, there were 142 modern ships of that size lost at sea,all with clear, known causes (source: Lloyd's Register – Fairplay). The main culprits were the Iranian and Iraqi air forces in the 1980s (See: Iran–Iraq War). One of the very few cases where evidence suggests a freak wave incident is the 1978 loss of the freighter München.  Known or suspected rogue wave incidents  Before 1950 * On 11 March 1861 at midday the lighthouse on Eagle Island, off the west coast of Ireland was struck by a large wave that smashed 23 panes, washing some of the lamps down the stairs and damaging beyond repair the reflectors with broken glass. In order to damage the uppermost portion of the lighthouse, water would have had to surmount a seaside cliff measuring 40 m (133 ft) and a further 26 m (87 ft) of lighthouse structure. * On 13 November 1865, the wooden cutter Aenid was in the Tasman Sea near Long Reef off New South Wales, Australia, when her helmsman sighted three huge waves approaching from her starboard quarter. Before he could turn the cutter to face them, they swamped Aenid and wrecked her with the loss of two lives. Four others on board survived. The wreck later was found washed up on Long Reef with part of its side stove in.\\"Wreck of the cutter yacht Aenid and supposed loss of life\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, 14 November 1865. * On 15 December 1900, three lighthouse keepers mysteriously disappeared from the Flannan Isles Lighthouse in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland during a storm. Although there were no surviving witnesses, a rogue wave that hit the west side of the island has been hypothesized to be responsible. * On 10 October 1903, the British passenger liner was only four hours out of New York City when, at 2:30 p.m., a freak wave struck her. The wave was reported to be at least high and struck the ship on the port side. The wave carried away part of the fore bridge and smashed the guardrail stanchions. There were a number of first-class passengers sitting in deck chairs close to the bridge and they caught the full force of the water. One passenger was fatally injured and several other passengers were hurt. * The Blue Anchor Line luxury steamer SS Waratah, an Australian ship of 16,000 gross tons, disappeared without trace south of Durban, South Africa, in July 1909 with 211 passengers and crew aboard. No survivors or wreckage were found. The most plausible theory for her disappearance is that she encountered a rogue wave which either caused her to capsize or flooded her cargo holds, sinking her almost instantly. * On 7 November 1915 at 2:27 a.m., the British battleship suffered severe damage during a storm in the Pentland Firth when two large waves struck her in rapid succession. Water rose as high as the bottom of her lower foretop, filling it with water, sweeping her forward deck clear, smashing her forebridge – much of which was found in pieces on her upper deck – wrecking her chart house, shifting the roof of her conning tower, and flooding her forward main gun turret, mess decks, and flats. Five of her crew died, and 17 others suffered serious injuries.oldweather.com Log entries of HMS Albemarle.naval-history.net Royal Navy Logbooks of the World War I Era: HMS ALBEMARLE – March 1915 to November 1916, 3rd BS, Grand Fleet, damaged in gale Nov 1915, North Russia (icebreaker)Jackson Papers, National Museum of the Royal Navy, Portsmouth, U.K. 255/4/31. * At midnight on 5–6 May 1916 the British polar explorer Ernest Shackleton was at the tiller of the small sailboat James Caird in the Southern Ocean during a storm when he thought he saw the bad weather clearing in the west, astern. He then realized that what he thought was a line of white clouds above a clear dark sky was actually the crest of a single enormous wave that struck and nearly swamped the boat. Shackleton reported that the wave was larger than any he had ever seen before in his 26 years of seafaring.Carol Fowl.

The waves also damaged and nearly capsized the U.S. Navy gunboat , which also was in the harbor. Once described as a tsunami, the waves have more recently been assessed as exceptionally large, freak wind-driven waves generated by passing hurricanes.*Smith, Craig B. Extreme Waves.

Two United States Geological Survey (USGS) crew members were trapped briefly inside the capsized ship, but they were able to find their way to the bridge doors and escaped. The life raft was inflated and the three attempted to paddle out of the surf zone. The size of the raft and drogue anchor prevented escape in the raft. The USGS crew donned the two available life jackets and all three attempted to swim to a pocket beach on Point Arguello. After the captain made shore he swam back out to assist both of the USGS crew to shore. One USGS crew member was treated for facial lacerations and a slight concussion.

The AEB is best known for its long-running slogan, \\"The Incredible, Edible Egg\\", and the Just Mayo scandal.  Organization  The American Egg Board (AEB) is a checkoff organization, meaning that it is funded by a levy against its members for each unit they produce; in this case, an amount per case of eggs shipped. Through the AEB, U.S. egg producers come together, in accordance with statutory authority, to establish, finance and execute coordinated programs on research, education and promotion—all geared to drive demand for eggs and egg products. The Board consists of 18 members and 18 alternates from all regions of the country, nominated by the egg industry, and appointed by the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture. AEB and all program activities are funded by U.S. egg producers, subject to USDA approval. AEB is located in Chicago, Ill. History American egg farmers approved the creation of the American Egg Board in a 1975 referendum. It was created by the Egg Research and Promotion Order pursuant to the Egg Research and Consumer Information Act of 1974.Egg Research and Promotion Order, , December 22, 1975, codified at Egg Research and Consumer Information Act, , codified at A referendum was conducted November 3–28, 1975, by the Agricultural Marketing Service and seventy-three percent of eligible producers approved the program. The Egg Board established by the order became the American Egg Board beginning July 9, 1976. In 1977, American egg farmers also began work on an advertising campaign to increase demand for eggs – its first television commercial began airing in 1977, touting the nutritional benefits as \\"The Incredible, Edible Egg\\" featuring actor James Hampton. In 1993, the American Egg Board launched a new advertising campaign called \\"I Love Eggs\\", in which the campaign ran from 1993 to 1997. In 1998, the American Egg Board launched another advertising campaign called \\"If it ain't eggs, it ain't breakfast, I love eggs\\". The American Egg Board also promotes the many facets of egg products and the unique functionalities they contribute to many packaged food products. The term ‘egg products’ refers to processed and convenience forms of eggs for foodservice and food manufacturers. These products can be classified as refrigerated liquid, frozen, dried, and pre-cooked products. Additionally, the American Egg Board also works with foodservice professionals to keep eggs on top of evolving food trends, emerging consumer needs and changing competitive landscapes. Suppression of free marketplace In 2008, The Egg Board tried to funnel $3 million to a private lobbying organization, attempting to overturn a California ballot measure which would prohibit the extreme confinement of farm animals. This unlawful coordination with an advocacy group was stopped by an injunction issued by a federal court. Anti-competitive marketing tactics have also been displayed by the Egg Board in their involvement to get government retailers and regulators to participate in the halting of sales for Just Mayo brand products. The USDA found emails by the Egg Board threatening to put a “hit” CEO Josh Tetrick of Hampton Creek, the company that produces Just Mayo brand products. Hampton Creek campaign In September 2015, the board was investigated regarding their actions of paid advocacy against Hampton Creek, a company marketing vegan egg substitutes and Just Mayo, a mayonnaise substitute which uses pea protein as an emulsifier in place of eggs. In September 2015, a Freedom of Information request by Ryan Shapiro had revealed a number of cases where the government-controlled American Egg Board (AEB) had engaged in a systematic paid advocacy campaign targeting Hampton Creek. The AEB paid food bloggers to post articles containing the group's talking points regarding eggs, targeted personalities and websites that had posted articles covering the company in a positive manner, and purchased keyword advertising on Google Search to display advertisements on searches for Hampton Creek or its founder Josh Tetrick, among other actions. AEB chief executive Joanne Ivy stated at one point that Hampton Creek was a \\"crisis and major threat to the future.\\" She suggested, in remarks that were later claimed to be jokes, to have a murder-for-hire plot initiated against Tetrick. These actions violate USDA policies, which disallow advertising by its marketing boards that are \\"deemed disparaging to another commodity.\\" The USDA stated in a report that AEB staff “will be required to complete additional training regarding proper email etiquette and ethics.”American Egg Board's work to thwart plant-based mayo was wrong – USDA. The Guardian. October 7, 2016. As a result of the Hampton Creek scandal, the chief executive of the board, Joanne Ivy, took early retirement.  Egg Nutrition Center  American egg farmers also established the Egg Nutrition Center (ENC), which serves as a source of nutrition and health science information, and conducts in scientific health research and education related to eggs. ENC also monitors scientific findings and regulatory developments, and serves as a resource for health practitioners. Charitable Commitment America's egg farmers have donated millions of eggs to America's food banks and pantries in addition to their ongoing disaster relief work in response to tragedies like the 2010 Haiti earthquake and the 2011 Joplin, Mo. tornado. Additionally, they provide millions of dollars in free educational materials to American schools to help promote agricultural education and agricultural literacy. White House Easter Egg Roll Since 1977, AEB also has supported the annual White House Easter Egg Roll, the largest public event on the south lawn of the White House. America's egg farmers donate approximately 30,000 eggs to be rolled, hunted, decorated, and snacked on each year. The Incredible Egg also has a presence on the South Lawn, through “Farm to Table: An Egg’s Journey,” a hands-on exhibit that shows how eggs get from the hen house to the home. A giant inflatable Incredible Balloon and mascot can also be found on the lawn throughout the day and EggPops are handed out as a snack to hungry attendees. This annual event also includes the presentation of a commemorative egg to the First Lady. The Commemorative Eggs are created by artists from across the nation. The eggs become the property of the first family and typically end up on display in the presidential library.

(English translation of original 1784 article:) \\"Idea of a Universal History on a Cosmo-Political Plan\\" in The London Magazine: pp. 385-393. () is a 1784 essay by Prussian philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), a lecturer in anthropology and geography at Königsberg University.McCarthy, Thomas, \\"On Reconciling Cosmopolitan Unity and National Diversity\\" in Overview The essay was published as Kant was gaining repute as a philosopher following the publication of his revolutionary treatise on epistemology, The Critique of Pure Reason (1781) and preceding his critique of ethical theory, Critique of Practical Reason (1788). \\"Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Purpose\\" embroiled Kant in controversy due to the political implications of its critique of his contemporary Johann Gottfried Herder. The essay proceeds by way of nine propositions through which Kant seeks to prove his claim that rational and moral autonomy will inevitably defeat the compulsions of self- interested individualism. Kant seeks to achieve this by advancing a hierarchical account of development of world history.Tully, James. \\"The Kantian Idea of Europe\\" in In writing from the perspective of a universal history, Kant valorizes an unrealized future state (though he is aware, however, of the problem of theorizing without empirical basis, recognizing the appearance of irrationality that such an enterprise exhibits and criticizing Herder for extracting conclusions from speculative psychologizing).Mah, Harold, \\"The Age of Herder, Kant, and Hegel\\", in Kant classifies the constitutional republics of contemporary Western Europe—marked as they were by federalism, status-seeking, individualism and a degree of moral and cultural maturity—as belonging to an advanced, yet still intermediate, stage of development, judging them to be civilized but not thoroughly moral. All other societies are deemed inferior and judged according to the benchmark of European nation-states. Kant proposes that the European nations were tending towards statehood in a federation characterized by a universalist and cosmopolitan moral culture—a historical end-state also approached (albeit at a slower pace) by those inferior non-European societies, defined as they still were by the embrace of faith.

Prelude The Battle The Marshal of Feuquières with 13,000 Frenchmen invests the Thionville plaza in Lorraine, rescued by Cardinal Infante and Ottavio Piccolomini with 6,000 knights and 10-14,000 infantrymen, a Spanish contingent led by the Luxembourgish baron Jean de Beck, with the third of Naples and the artillery directed by Ernest de Suys. In the morning, the Imperials attack the opposing positions, then the battle to stop that allows the French to line up (11:00), while Piccolomini sends reinforcements inside the fortress. The Imperials return to the attack (16.00) and conquer the hill on the left side to the French, where Piccolomini places the artillery. The French cavalry, beaten by the imperial artillery, is charged by the imperial cavalry by the Marquis Camillo Gonzaga, is defeated and persecuted, even if the Gonzaga remain among the fallen. The besieged make an exit against the French right flank. The imperialists envelop and defeat the French infantry, capturing all the artillery and numerous materials. The losers leave 5-6,000 of the dead and wounded, 3,000 prisoners including Feuquieres, who dies from his injuries, and Count Pas, commander of the infantry. The winners have 1,500 fallen. Aftermath Feuquières, wounded in the fighting, was captured by the Imperial forces and died in captivity. In recognition of his victory, Piccolomini was created Duke of Amalfi by the Spanish Crown on 28 June.Jacques (2006), p. 1013 In 1643 the Duc d'Enghien capitalised on his victory at Rocroi by pushing on to Thionville, which fell after a stubborn defence by the Spanish garrison.

Flores, 557 U.S. 433 (2009), is a case in which the United States Supreme Court remanded the case to determine whether Arizona's general education funding budget supports Equal Educational Opportunities Act (EEOA)-compliant English Language Learner (ELL) programming. Background The case was brought in 1992 by English Language Learner (ELL) students against the state board of education and state superintendent on the grounds that the Nogales Unified School District had failed to teach the students English, which was vital to their success. The case is styled after the plaintiff, Miriam Flores, one of the parents involved in the case, and the defendant, Thomas Horne, the Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction. In 2000, after almost eight years of pretrial proceedings and settling of various claims, the federal district court in Arizona held that the state was violating the Equal Educational Opportunity Act because the amount of funding it allocated for the special needs of ELL students was arbitrary and not related to the actual funding needed to cover the costs of ELL instruction in the plaintiffs' school district. Opinion of the Court On June 25, 2009, the United States Supreme Court overturned the decision of the state court, deciding in favor of Horne, and allowing the state to determine its own requirements with regards to ELL instruction. Justice Alito wrote the opinion for the 5-4 majority. The opinion held that in evaluating the actions of the state attention should focus on student outcomes rather than on spending and inputs to schools.To support this, the majority opinion relied on the arguments in Eric A. Hanushek and Alfred A. Lindseth (2009), Schoolhouses, courthouses, and statehouses: Solving the funding-achievement puzzle in America's public schools (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press). Dissent Justice Breyer, joined by Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg. Justice Breyer argued that the lower courts did fairly consider every change in circumstances that the parties called to their attention, and that the majority opinion risks denying schoolchildren the English language instruction necessary to overcome language barriers that impede equal participation.https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-289.ZD.html See also *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 557 *List of United States Supreme Court cases References External links * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States education case law Category:Linguistic rights Category:2009 in United States case law Category:2009 in education Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court ","title":"Horne v.

Early work From 1947-1950, Heinze studied under Robert Weaver, Howard Trafton, and Robert Ward Johnson at the School of Visual Arts and the Art Students League in New York. During the 1950s and 1960s he worked as a freelance commercial artist on Madison Avenue. In 1970 he began his career as a photorealist painter in Bondville, Vermont; many of his paintings from this period depict parts of automobiles and motorcycles in close-up. \\"Abstract realism\\" In 1978 Heinze relocated to Marin County, California, and began exploring more diverse subjects. He increasingly moved toward storefront- window and city scenes, in a style that he calls \\"abstract realism,\\" where the subject is real but the point of view and composition give the painting an abstract quality — resulting in a kind of reverse trompe l'oeil. As his works can appear half-real, half-abstract, it is not surprising that the artist himself describes abstract realism as \\"a total oxymoron.\\" In addition to his urban subjects, Heinze has also painted dilapidated farm equipment such as tractors and water pumps, and old trains and locomotive engines; in Exactitude: Hyperrealist Art Today, John Russell Taylor writes that \\"Heinze is fascinated by decaying machinery left behind as the detritus of the Industrial Revolution. The forms are powerful, if inscrutable.\\"Taylor 2009. He has also done series of paintings depicting rocky cliffsides, vineyard grapes, and streams; much of his subject matter is characterized by complex reflections off glass or water, intricate foliage, and deep background blacks with saturated colors in the foreground. In Photorealism at the Millennium, Louis K. Meisel writes that Heinze \\"has not settled into any particular subject matter or point of view. This makes his work less distinctive and recognizable than that of other photorealists, but it also provides him with an added degree of freedom.\\" Heinze's paintings have been featured in the books The Martini and The Cigar, both by Barnaby Conrad III. In 1999 he began collaborating with Magnolia Editions to produce lithographic reproductions.

Biography Interior of the Cunerakerk Rhenen Van Bassen was the illegitimate son of Cornelis van Bassen and the grandson of Bartholt Ernst van Bassen, who both lived and died in The Hague. Little is known of his early life, but according to the Netherlands Institute for Art History he became a member of the Delft Guild of St. Luke in 1613.Bartholomeus van Bassen in the RKD In 1622 he moved to The Hague, where he became a member of The Hague Guild of St. Luke two years later and where he became dean in 1627 and headman in 1636 and 1640. He is known for his architectural works, sometimes with staffage by the painters Anthonie Palamedesz, Esaias van de Velde, and Jan Martszen de Jonge. In 1638 he became city architect of the Hague. He worked on the summer palace Huis Honselaarsdijk for Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange (torn down after being used as a military hospital during the War of 1812), the restoration of the City Hall, and from 1649 onwards he was involved with building the Nieuwe Kerk. Van Bassen was also involved in a number of nationwide architectural projects. His most important building was \\"Het Koningshuis\\", the summer palace of Frederick V, Elector Palatine. Called \\"King of Bohemia\\" for one winter, he is remembered in the Netherlands as the \\"Winterkoning\\" for this reason. His summer palace was in the town of Rhenen, near Utrecht, and it was built to Bassen's design in 1629-1631. This palace, like Honselaarsdijk, was also used as a military hospital during the War of 1812 and was torn down soon after. He kept a workshop and took on pupils, most notably Gerard Houckgeest and Jan van der Vucht. He died in The Hague.

After being viewed acting suspiciously, the Ophelia was boarded on 17 October 1914 and seized by the Royal Navy for violating Hague Convention X of 1907 concerning hospital ships. After her seizure, she operated in British service as SS Huntley until sunk in December 1915. Seizure On 17 October 1914 a number of German torpedo boats were destroyed during the Battle off Texel by the British cruiser, HMS Undaunted, while laying mines off Haak lightship.

Suspicions were aroused when British intelligence learned that Ophelia was using a wireless radio set, – Total pages: 589 at that time unusual for a hospital ship, to communicate with the German wireless base at Norddeich station. In addition to using wireless radio she was using coded wireless transmissions; secret codes or their use are forbidden on hospital ships.

Under Article 4 of Hague Convention X, hospital ships cannot be seized but they can be inspected by enemy craft. was sent to investigate the ship. As it approached for boarding and inspection it was observed that her commander, Dr. Pfeiffer, threw overboard a number of documents and secret codes. Reasons for seizure The British Admiralty seized the Ophelia as a prize of war, rather than as a hospital ship. Their reasons for doubting her status as a hospital ship were the dumping of documents by the crew, the transmission of a coded message before the boarding, and the destruction of the ship's wireless set. Furthermore, the ship was not included in the list of hospital ships that were exchanged at the start of the war. An enormous number of Verey lights were discovered on board. Fired from special pistols, Verey lights can be used as signal devices. The Ophelia had 600 green, 480 red and 140 white lights, and all records of how many she had before the seizure were destroyed before boarding. For comparison, a British hospital ship would stock about 12 lights of each colour. – Total pages: 316 German response Germany later used the seizure of the Ophelia to try and justify its attacks on hospital ships: > On 17 October, 1914 ... we sent out the hospital ship Ophelia to pick up any > survivors. However, the English captured her and made her prize, charging us > with having sent her for scouting purposes, although she was obviously > fitted up as a hospital ship and bore all the requisite markings...We also > considered ourselves released from our obligations and with far more > justification took action against hospital ships which, under cover of the > Red Cross flag, were patently used for the transport of troops. — German > Admiral Scheer Aftermath The British renamed the ship SS Huntley and used her for transporting fuel from Portishead to Boulogne.

WFJV-LP radio first signed on in early 2003, operating at 107.5 MHz; it had a blend of contemporary hit music and select oldies along with news, public affairs and religious programming. On September 13, 2005, Tampa Bay-area radio station WXGL 107.3 FM was granted a permit to move its transmitting facilities from Oldsmar to the WDUV transmitter site in Holiday. This would put WXGL's transmitter much closer to WFJV-LP and would cause severe interference to WFJV-LP, being only one channel away at 107.5. WFJV-LP immediately filed with the FCC an application to move frequency to 103.3 MHz. It was granted December 1, 2004 and WFJV-LP began operating on its new frequency March 1, 2005. During this transition, it changed its format to its recent format of Bible Study and Gospel. On March 30, 2005, the permit to move transmitter sites for WXGL had expired and was canceled.

Local residents sometimes refer to the road as the Goat Trail. It winds around the steep, rocky slopes of Anthony's Nose, the southernmost peak of the Hudson Highlands on the east side of the Hudson River. In its first mile from the junction with NY 9D it climbs to a scenic overlook that looks out over Iona Island, Dunderberg Mountain, the city of Peekskill and the Charles Point power plant. There are interpretive displays on the history of the area during the Revolutionary War, where the Hudson River Chain was deployed and the Battle of Forts Clinton and Montgomery was fought. Near its eastern end, approximately from the bridge, is a Tudor Revival-style former toll house. It also served as the toll taker's residence. In 2002 it was renovated by the Town of Cortlandt and now serves as an information center and gift shop for visitors to the region. A small parking lot serves hikers taking a popular trail along Anthony's Nose, through lands in the Camp Smith New York Army National Guard base just above the highway, to the Appalachian Trail just north of the bridge. At its eastern end, before intersecting with US 9 at the Annsville Circle, the road falls to the level of the Hudson River, which it parallels. There, near the entrance to Camp Smith, looking south across a bay and the Metro-North railroad, can be seen the Indian Point nuclear power plant. The state required the Harriman family to build the road when the bridge was built in the mid-1920s, in order to connect the bridge with US 9 just north of Peekskill. It was intended to be higher on the mountainside than the similar Storm King Highway, which had been built upriver a decade earlier. Like that road, it has a stone wall, made from the of material excavated during the highway's construction. Original toll house, no longer in use The legislation that allowed the bridge's construction stipulated that the road and bridge would revert to the state at no cost after 30 years.

The group describes itself as a non-partisan association of current and former military, police, and first responders, who pledge to fulfill the oath that all military and police take in order to \\"defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic\\". It encourages its members to not obey orders which they believe would violate the United States Constitution. The organization claims a membership of 35,000 as of 2016. Several groups that monitor domestic terrorism and hate groups describe the Oath Keepers as extremist or radical. Mark Pitcavage of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) describes the group as \\"heavily armed extremists with a conspiratorial and anti-government mindset looking for potential showdowns with the government.\\" The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) lists the group's founder as a known extremist and describes his announced plans to create localized militia units as \\"frightening\\". According to the SPLC, the group espouses a number of conspiracy and legal theories associated with the sovereign citizen movement and the white supremacist posse comitatus movement. SPLC senior fellow Mark Potok describes the group as a whole as \\"really just an anti-government group who believe in a wild set of conspiracy theories\\". Oath Keepers were present wearing military fatigues in Ferguson, Missouri, during the 2014 and 2015 unrest in the city, when members armed with semi-automatic rifles patrolled streets and rooftops. Organizational history Oath Keepers was founded in March 2009 by Elmer Stewart Rhodes. Rhodes is a Yale Law School graduate, a former U.S. Army paratrooper, and a former staffer for Republican Congressman Ron Paul. On December 8, 2015, Rhodes was disbarred by the Montana Supreme Court for conduct violating the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct after refusing to respond to two bar grievances filed against him in the federal district court in Arizona.In the Matter of Elmer S. Rhodes (Mont. Dec. 8, 2015). Rhodes is reported to have taken inspiration from the notion that Adolf Hitler could have been stopped if German soldiers and police had refused to follow orders. Writing in S.W.A.T. Magazine in 2008, Rhodes asserts, \\"'It' (a full-blown totalitarian police state) cannot happen here if the majority of police and soldiers obey their oaths to defend the Constitution and refuse to enforce the unconstitutional edicts of the 'Leader'.\\"Rhodes, Stewart. \\"Just Following Orders.\\" S.W.A.T. Magazine Apr. 2008. Web. August 20, 2015. Oath- keepers.blogspot.com Membership The organization states that full membership is open to \\"currently serving military, reserves, National Guard, police, fire-fighters, other first responders (i.e. State Guard, Sheriff Posse/Auxiliary, Search & Rescue, EMT, other medical 1st responders, etc.) AND veterans/former members of those services,\\" and that others who support the organization's mission can become associate members. The organization says that it has up to 30,000 members, though this figure has been questioned.Fowler, Sarah. Ferguson Unrest: Who Are the Mysterious 'Oath Keepers'? , BBC News (August 12, 2015). Activities Unauthorized recruitment center presence Following the 2015 Chattanooga shootings at a strip mall military recruitment center and a naval operational support center in Tennessee, Oath Keepers and other militia groups began organizing armed gatherings outside of recruiting centers in several states, with the stated objective of providing protection to service members, who were barred from carrying weapons while on duty in civilian recruitment centers. In response, the Army Command Operations Center Security Division issued a letter ordering soldiers not to interact with or acknowledge armed civilians outside of recruitment centers, and that \\"If questioned by these alleged concerned citizens, be polite, professional and terminate the conversation immediately and report the incident to local law enforcement,\\" noting that the issuing officer is \\"sure the citizens mean well, but we cannot assume this in every case and we do not want to advocate this behavior\\". Ferguson protests In late November 2014, during the unrest in Ferguson, the Oath Keepers put out a national request to its members to help in the city after the grand jury decision was released in the case of the shooting of Michael Brown. In reference to the perceived failure of the government's response to the unrest, the organization's founder, Stewart Rhodes, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, \\"We thought they were going to do it right this time, but when Monday rolled around and they didn't park the National Guard at these businesses, that's when we said we have got to do something.\\" On December 2, 2014, volunteer security guards associated with the Oath Keepers kept armed watch on Ferguson rooftops, ignoring a police order to stop.Bogan, Jesse (December 2, 2014). Oath Keepers' are back on the rooftops in Ferguson despite St. Louis County ordinance . St. Louis Post-Dispatch. In August 2015, four members of the group appeared again on the streets of Ferguson, following peaceful street demonstrations on the anniversary of Brown's shooting. According to an article in The Washington Post, \\"The men—all of them white and heavily armed—said they were in the area to protect someone who worked for the Web site InfoWars, which is affiliated with talk-radio conspiracy theorist and self-described 'thought criminal against Big Brother' Alex Jones.\\" The Oath Keepers claimed to be on the side of the protestors. St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar told the newspaper that the Oath Keepers' \\"presence was both unnecessary and inflammatory.\\" One Ferguson activist, Ryan Herring, described their presence as intimidating and frightening, and criticized the Oath Keepers for their suggestion that protestors should use their legal right to openly carry firearms by saying that this would have increased the tension with the police. Sam Andrews, a member of the Oath Keepers, contended that the protestors calmed down when the Oath Keepers arrived at the protest. St. Louis County police officer Dan Page was relieved of duty in 2014 after pushing and threatening with arrest CNN journalist Don Lemon on live television in Ferguson. Subsequently, an hour-long videotaped speech made by Page to an Oath Keepers meeting was found on YouTube. In the speech, Page boasted, \\"I'm also a killer. I've killed a lot, and if I need to I'll kill a whole bunch more.\\" Page also denounced hate crime laws, disparaged Muslims, and espoused Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories (Page referred to Obama as \\"that illegal alien claiming to be president\\"). The YouTube video contained a disclaimer stating that Page's opinions did not reflect those of the local chapter or national organization.McLaughlin, Michael (August 22, 2014). St. Louis County Police Officer Dan Page Suspended Following Inflammatory Video , The Huffington Post. The group's activities in Ferguson led to them being labeled \\"vigilantes\\" by some journalists. Kim Davis On September 10, 2015, the Oath Keepers announced that they would travel to Rowan County, Kentucky, to prevent Kim Davis from being arrested and jailed should she be held in contempt a second time for violating a court order prohibiting her from interfering with marriage licensing in her office. The group aimed to block enforcement of contempt of court rulings against Davis, and said, \\"If the sheriff, who should be interceding, is not going to do his job and the governor is not going to do the governor's job of interceding, then we'll do it.\\" The Oath Keepers also criticized the judge in the case, David Bunning, saying \\"this judge needs to be put on notice that his behavior is not going to be accepted and we'll be there to stop it and intercede ourselves if we have to.\\" Members were advised the following day that Davis's legal team, acting on her behalf, had declined their offer to provide a \\"security detail\\" to Davis. The Oath Keepers issued a statement saying that while members were still welcome to visit Rowan County, it would be in an unofficial capacity only. Aftermath of Parkland High School Shooting In February 2018, soon after the Stoneman Douglas High School mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, Oath Keepers founder Rhodes publicly called upon \\"tens of thousands\\" of the group's members to form militias to protect US schools and colleges. Rhodes posted on the Oath Keepers' website in what he termed a National Call to Action: \\"Oath Keepers, in the wake of the horrific attack … it is time to step up nationwide and defend our schools against the threat of mass murder. Enough is enough\\". Other activities Charles A. Dyer was a United States Marine Corps sergeant who operated as an advocate for the Oath Keepers, maintaining a popular YouTube channel and acting as a representative at Tea Party rallies. Dyer was charged in 2010 with child rape and illegal weapons possession. Dyer evaded authorities and a manhunt ensued, followed by capture ten days later. In 2012, Dyer was convicted on his child rape charge. The Oath Keepers severed ties with Dyer after his initial forays with the law and denied a relationship with him. In 2014, armed Oath Keepers were present at the Bundy Ranch standoff, when agents of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) seized cattle that a rancher was judged to be illegally grazing on federal land in Clark County, Nevada. In 2015, armed Oath Keepers in the Pacific Northwest attended two disputes between gold miners and federal authorities. In April they gathered in Medford, Oregon, at the request of the owners of the Sugar Pine Mine near Galice, after the owners were ordered to stop working the mine by the Bureau of Land Management. In August, they patrolled the White Hope Mine in the Helena National Forest, about 20 miles from Lincoln, Montana; the U.S. Forest Service said the miners had engaged in illegal construction and tree- felling. Members of the Oath Keepers arrived at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon to offer to provide \\"perimeter security\\" for other militants who were illegally occupying the site. On January 15, 2016, Stewart Andrews, leader of the Oath Keepers, issued bellicose warnings on the group's website of a prospective \\"conflagration so great, it cannot be stopped, leading to a bloody, brutal civil war\\" if the Bundy-led occupation devolved into armed violence. In August 2017 a permit was issued by the NPS for the August 26th use of Crissy Field to hold a rally by a group calling itself 'Patriot Prayer'. The group's spokesman, Joey Gibson, announced that the Oath Keepers would be providing event security, confirmed to The San Francisco Examiner on August 18 by Stewart Rhodes. In June 2019, Oregon Governor Kate Brown sent the Oregon State Police to bring 11 absent Republican state senators back to the Oregon State Capitol. The Republican state senators had gone into hiding to prevent a vote on a cap-and-trade proposal aimed at lowering greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in order to combat climate change. The Oath Keepers reacted on June 20, 2019, by stating: \\"Gov. Brown, you want a civil war, because this is how you get a civil war\\". On June 22, 2019, a session of the Oregon Senate was canceled when the Oregon State Capitol was closed due to a warning from the state police of a \\"possible militia threat\\". After three people were killed in Portland, Oregon and Kenosha, Wisconsin, protests, Stewart Rhodes, the founder of Oath Keepers tweeted, “The first shot [of a civil war] has been fired brother.” National politics An article posted to the organization's official website on April 14, 2016, opined that if Hillary Clinton won the 2016 United States presidential election, \\"the result would probably be outright civil war in the U.S.\\" Later in 2016, Stewart Rhodes called on members to visit polling places incognito to \\"hunt down\\" and document suspected voter fraud. Members of the group were \\"protecting\\" visitors and acting as armed security for several Republican Party funded events for President Donald Trump's political rallies in Dallas, Texas, and Tupelo, Mississippi, in the fall of 2019. Reception Larry Keller wrote in the SPLC's 2009 report The Second Wave: Return of the Militias that the Oath Keepers \\"may be a particularly worrisome example of the Patriot revival.\\" Keller described Richard Mack, an Oath Keeper, as a \\"longtime militia hero\\" and quoted him as having said, \\"The greatest threat we face today is not terrorists; it is our federal government. ... One of the best and easiest solutions is to depend on local officials, especially the sheriff, to stand against federal intervention and federal criminality.\\" Mack, a former sheriff, responded by denying the claims, saying, \\"I have had no contact with any militia group and have never been a member of any militia.\\" Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the SPLC, said in an interview that the group has no history of political violence, but that, \\"The core ideas of these groups relate to the fear that elites in this country and around the world are slowly and steadily and nefariously moving us towards a one-world government, the so-called New World Order.\\"Wang, Hansi Lo. Oath Keepers Say They're Defending Ferguson; Others Say They're Not Helping . NPR (August 12, 2015). In 2009, the Anti- Defamation League (ADL) wrote in a report that, \\"The 'orders' the Oath Keepers refuse [to obey] reveal their extreme conspiratorial mindset, because the 'orders' are not instructions ever likely to be actually handed down by Obama or his officials; instead, they are reflective of the anti-government conspiracy theories embraced by the extreme right.\\"Rage Grows in America: Anti‑Government Conspiracies: Oath Keepers , Anti-Defamation League (November 2009), p. 26. Quoting the Las Vegas Review-Journal, MSNBC political commentator Pat Buchanan wrote: \\"Oath Keepers, depending on where one stands, are either strident defenders of liberty or dangerous peddlers of paranoia.\\" Buchanan himself concluded that \\"America was once their country. They sense they are losing it. And they are right.\\" Fox News Radio host Lou Dobbs spoke with founder Stewart Rhodes on his radio show in 2009 and criticized the SPLC for \\"perpetuating the same kind of intolerance it claims to condemn.\\" On Hardball with Chris Matthews, Matthews questioned Rhodes about his \\"vigilante group\\" and on his \\"strange view of the world.\\" Protesters have accused the group of racism, especially after groups of white members armed with rifles congregated in Ferguson during demonstrations related to police brutality and racial inequality.Laughland, Oliver, Jon Swaine, and Joanna Walters, White Militiamen Roam Ferguson with Rifles While Black Men Wrongly Arrested , The Guardian (August 11, 2015).

Football career Taylor was born at Halesowen in the West Midlands and started his professional football career in January 1910 with Stourbridge, playing in the Birmingham & District League. In the summer of 1910, he moved to Yorkshire to join Hull City of the Football League Second Division, where he spent a year in the reserves, failing to break into the first-team. The 1911 close-season saw a move back to Shropshire and the Birmingham & District League, when Taylor joined Wellington Town. During the 1911–12 season, he gained a reputation as a prolific scorer with 27 goals. This brought him to the attention of several larger clubs, including Coventry City. In the summer of 1912, Coventry City's trainer, Jimmy McIntyre, moved to Southern League rivals, Southampton as trainer under secretary Ernest Arnfield. On arrival at The Dell, McIntyre recommended Taylor to his new club, who signed him ready for the 1912–13 season. Taylor made his debut for the \\"Saints\\" in the opening match of the season, playing at inside-right in a 2–2 draw with Northampton Town on 4 September. Taylor found the pace at first-class level much faster than in non-league football and after only one goal in eleven games, he lost his place to another new signing, Fred Turnbull. Taylor made two further appearances, scoring once more, but spent the remainder of the season playing in Southampton's Southern Alliance team, scoring four goals from twelve appearances. In the summer of 1913, he moved to Lancashire to join Barrow, then playing in the Lancashire Combination.

In all, Gillette received seven \\"W\\"'s while attending the University of Wisconsin. 1910 season As a sophomore in 1910, Gillette played principally at halfback for the Badgers. As the season progressed, Gillette gained attention for his \\"speed and dodging ability.\\" It was reported that he \\"displayed so much promise\\" that special plays were built for him. In a late November 1910 rivalry game against the University of Chicago, Gillette starred for Wisconsin in a 10-0 win. In the fourth quarter of a close game, newspaper accounts report that \\"Gillette, in two magnificent runs, took the ball over for the second touchdown for Wisconsin.\\" One newspaper wrote that Gillette's \\"run of 70 yards through a broken field [in the 1910 Chicago game] was one of the best ever seen on Camp Randall.\\" 1911 season At the end of the 1911 football season, Gillette became embroiled in an eligibility dispute involving charges by Coach Henry L. Williams of the University of Minnesota. Minnesota charged that several Wisconsin players, including Gillette, had played professional baseball during the summer. The charge involving Gillette was that he had played first base on one of the commercial league teams at Madison where admission was charged at the gate. After an investigation, it was determined that Gillette's eligibility to play in 1912 was intact. 1912 season As quarterback of the 1912 team, Gillette led the school to a Western Conference championship. As the season progressed, newspapers touted Gillette as one of the best football players in the country. Gillette scored touchdowns on long runs of 90 yards against Northwestern and 60 and 55 yards against Purdue. In the final game of the 1912 season, Wisconsin defeated Iowa by a score of 28-10 in Iowa City. Gillette scored the first touchdown of the game circling around the Iowa end for a gain of 50 yards. Gillette threw for another touchdown in the third quarter, passing the ball into the endzone from the eight-yard line. The 1912 Badgers outscored their opponents 246 to 29 and finished the year with a perfect 7-0 record as follows: * 10-05-1912: 13-0 win over Lawrence (WI) * 10-12-1912: 56-0 win over Northwestern * 10-19-1912: 41-0 win over Purdue * 11-02-1912: 30-12 win over Chicago * 11-09-1912: 64-7 win over Arkansas * 11-16-1912: 14-0 win over Minnesota * 11-23-1912: 28-10 win over Iowa One syndicated article on Gillette reported: > \\"Western football critics are of the opinion that if Eddie Gillette, the > Badgers' star quarterback keeps up his brilliant work he will surely be the > selection for the position on the mythical All-American eleven.

His most > brilliant accomplishment was a sixty five yard run for a touchdown at the > opening of the second quarter.\\" At the end of the 1912 season, Gillette was selected as a first-team All- American quarterback by syndicated sports writer Tommy Clark and Alfred S. Harvey of the Milwaukee Free Press. He was also unanimously selected as the first-team quarterback by the various experts picking All-Western teams, including Walter Eckersall, the Chicago Record-Herald, the Milwaukee Free Press, and the Milwaukee Sentinel. (\\"Eddie Gillette, the great Badger quarterback, is unanimously picked for that position and he should be a strong candidate for that place on the All-American team which as yet has not been picked.\\") When Gillette was completely omitted from the All-American teams selected by Eastern football expert Walter Camp (whose omission of Western players was an ongoing subject of controversy), Wisconsin supporters \\"sneered at the idea that Camp had found three better quarterbacks than Wisconsin's brilliant Eddie Gillette.\\" One writer described Gillette's contributions in 1912 as follows: > \\"Eddie Gillette, Wisconsin's great quarterback, is rated as one of the best > who has ever been seen in the west and he has been on every All-Conference > and All-Western team which has been picked. The Badger star played his first > year at quarter this fall having previously been a halfback and he more than > made good, proving to be a great ___ a good field general and a reliable and > brilliant man to carry the ball. Gillette's playing should entitle him to a > place on the All-American as he seems to be better than any quarterback on > any of the eastern elevens.\\" Later years In 1913, after graduating from Wisconsin, he was hired as a coach at Louisville Manual Training School. In 1914, he was hired as the coach at Batavia High School in Batavia, Illinois. As of January 1915, Gillette was assistant engineer of the Aurora, Elgin & Chicago railroad. At that time, he was reported to be in negotiations with Joe Tinker to play as a pitcher for Tinker's Chicago Whales baseball team in the Federal League. After graduating from Wisconsin in 1913, Gillette pitched many games for Illinois teams and \\"beat some of the best pitchers in the 'Three-Eye League'.\\" See also * 1912 College Football All-America Team References Category:Wisconsin Badgers football players Category:1890s births Category:Year of death missing Category:Sportspeople from Aurora, Illinois ","title":"Eddie Gillette"},{"id":"24206808","title":"Closer (The Corrs song)"},{"id":"24206809","text":"Jared Evan (born September 21, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter, record producer and rapper. He was born in Great Neck, New York. He was signed to Zone 4 under Interscope Records. The song \\"Frozen\\" which Jared wrote and produced, appeared on the LeBron James documentary soundtrack entitled Music Inspired by More Than a Game. In 2013 his album Boom Bap & Blues with Statik Selektah peaked at No. 8 on the iTunes Soul charts independently. Biography Early life Jared Evan Siegel grew up in Great Neck, New York. He started out by playing the drums, dreaming to one day become the next Keith Moon. Initially wanting to be a professional drummer, Jared eventually began taking on several other talents. He later became heavily influenced by seminal hip hop artists such as the Wu-Tang Clan, Mos Def, Kool G Rap, and A Tribe Called Quest. He studied early hip hop while also taking musical cues from his alternative and r&b;/soul influences such as Thom Yorke, Cream, Bradley Nowell, The Beatles, Stevie Wonder, Al Green, James Brown and others. His early years were troubled and music provided a therapeutic outlet for him. Later, Jared focused more on producing and songwriting. He started to incorporate raps, while introducing melodic undertones over his own production. In 2008 at the age of 18, Jared won the Brooklyn Hip Hop Festival's Spit 16 competition curated by The Source. It was around this time where Jared started interning at The FADER in New York City. He gave his then mixtape Radio in My Head to friend and acclaimed Hip Hop director Rik Cordero (whom he met while interning at The FADER). Rik and Jared started creating visually stunning music videos to complement Jared's sound. These videos were then circulated to the top music executives and within weeks Jared had several major label offers. Career In June 2009, Jared decided to sign with Zone 4/Interscope with the support of Jimmy Iovine. In October 2009, Jared was featured in Billboard as an \\"Under the radar artist with the potential to break into the big time.\\" In August 2010, Interscope released the single, \\"In Love with You.\\" In March 2011, the song was aired on the Greek television show Radio Arvyla and because of this, it met great success, reaching No. 1 overall on the Greek iTunes charts. During this time, he had also worked with some of his musical heroes such as The Neptunes, Dr. Dre and Mike Elizondo. In the Spring of 2011, Jared joined OneRepublic on a nationwide tour. At the end of 2011, Jared opted out of his contract with Interscope. He split ways with the label expressing that they were not supporting his true vision thoroughly. After leaving and going independent, Jared formed a passionate cult fan base. In 2012, Jared released his debut project entitled The 4th Chapter. It was released to fans for free online. He then helped write and produce a large portion of Hoodie Allen's mixtape Crew Cuts, before releasing his collaboration album with Statik Selektah entitled Boom Bap & Blues on February 26, 2013. It features artists like Joey Badass and Action Bronson, amongst several others. It was originally released as a free album through Jared's website, although days later the album debuted at No. 29 on the iTunes R&B;/Soul charts. Within a couple of hours it shot to No. 8. Boom Bap & Blues is said to be some of Jared's best work and has become critically acclaimed. In 2014, Jared produced a large portion of Hoodie Allen's debut album People Keep Talking. One of the songs, \\"Numbers,\\" which Evan produced and co-wrote, met great success reaching No. 5 overall on the iTunes charts. In November 2016, Jared released his first solo full-length album \\"The Blanket Truth\\". It peaked at No. 30 on the iTunes pop charts. In January 2018 Jared signed with EP Entertainment. In the spring of 2019, Jared started releasing a slew of new singles. He released the first single \\"Permanent Damage\\" in March 2019. He later released another single entitled \\"Dark Days\\" in July 2019, a third single \\"Perfect Strangers\\" in September 2019 and a fourth single \\"Sabotage\\" in December 2019. In the summer of 2020, Jared released The Art Form of Whatever II, a sequel to his 2015 mixtape The Art Form of Whatever. Musical style Evan's musical style combines soul, hip-hop, and pop with alternative rock and alternative R&B; influences. He is known for an introspective style of songwriting, often citing Bradley Nowell, The Beatles, Radiohead, Method Man, Mos Def, Al Green, Rza, DJ Premier, Stevie Wonder and early Coldplay as his main influences.

As a member of the basal echinoid order Cidaroida, its morphological, developmental and molecular genetic characteristics make it a phylogenetically interesting species. A specimen at the National Aquarium in Baltimore. Taxonomy Eucidaris tribuloides was first described and classified by Jean Baptiste Lamarck in 1816 as Cidarites tribuloides. Lamarck's original description of Cidarites tribuloides (Eucidaris tribuloides), ca. 1816.A specimen dried for preservation. The modern classification stems from the echinoid treatises by Pomel in 1883 and by Döderlein in 1887. Distribution and habitat The slate pencil urchin can be found on both sides of the Atlantic, and throughout the Caribbean. On the western side of the Atlantic, the slate pencil urchin has been found as far north as Cape Hatteras, North Carolina and as far south as Rio de Janeiro. In the Gulf of Mexico, populations have been reported at Alacran Reef, Campeche Bank. On the eastern side of the Atlantic, a closely related sub-species, Eucidaris tribuloides var. africana, has been reported at Cape Verde Islands, in the Gulf of Guinea, and at the Azores and Ascension Islands. E. tribuloides has become an invasive species in some parts of the world including Maltese waters where it has been since 1998. This was the first record in the Mediterranean and is thought to have been brought there in ballast water. McPherson described E. tribuloides as a \\"sluggish echinoid\\" that leads a nocturnal, benthic existence. During daylight hours, the slate pencil urchin uses its large primary spines to anchor itself under or atop rocks or to lodge itself in crevices. Individuals rarely stray far from their locality. At night, they will feed primarily on corals and sponges, among other things. Biology When its development is contrasted to the cidaroid sister subclass Euechinoidea, E. tribuloides becomes a very interesting organism from the standpoint of developmental and evolutionary biology. In euechinoid embryonic development, e.g. in the purple sea urchin, the micromeres comprise a set of four small cells that reside at the base of the vegetal plate. They are a \\"precociously invaginating lineage\\", meaning that they move into the blastocoel just prior to gastrulation; these four cells then eventually give rise to the larval skeleton. Similarly, E. tribuloides also possesses a larval skeleton that arises from a special lineage of cells. In contrast, however, the number and size of its micromeres can vary (from one to three), and they do not precociously invaginate; rather, they ingress during gastrulation and bud off from the tip of the growing archenteron. Although there are numerous molecular differences between the \\"spicule-forming cells\\" of E. tribuloides and the primary mesencyhme cells of euechinoids, these two cell lineages are thought to be homologous and have been contrasted in developmental evolution research. Reproduction Reproduction in E. tribuloides seems to be sensitive to seasonal cycles, solar cycles, and the lunar cycle. In the Florida Keys, E. tribuloides was found to obtain peak gravidity in the late summer and early fall. Populations in Panama, however, were found to be gravid in the spring, summer and fall, with peak gravidity occurring around the full moon.

Football career Cavendish was born in Burton-on-Trent and started his football career playing for nearby Overseal Town. In May 1898, he was spotted by a scout from Southern League champions, Southampton and he moved to the south coast, together with his teammate, goalkeeper John Joyce. Cavendish spent his first season at The Dell in the reserves, scoring 22 goals. His first-team debut came on 6 January 1900, when he took the place of the former England international Harry Wood at inside- left for the visit of Gravesend United. The \\"Saints\\" celebrated the start of the new century in style, with Cavendish scoring in a memorable 8–0 victory. Cavendish played in the next two matches (at centre-forward and centre-half respectively), before returning to the reserves. Described as \\"a gentlemanly player, often winning esteem and respect from many of his opponents\\", Cavendish made only one appearance in the 1900–01 season, followed by five appearances in 1901–02. In the 1902 close-season, Cavendish dropped into the Hampshire League with Freemantle before moving in 1904 to the East End of London with Clapton Orient. After a year in the Southern League Second Division when they finished in eighth position, Clapton Orient applied for election to the Football League and were successful, taking their place in Football League Division Two. Cavendish made no Football League appearances for Orient, although he did make one appearance in the FA Cup. Clapton Orient Cavendish made 21 Southern League appearances in 1904–05 with 14 goals, and 19 appearances with 12 goals for the reserve side in the London League. He also made three appearances in the FA Cup, without scoring, including in Orient's very first match in the famous FA Cup competition, home to Enfield on 17 September 1904, a 4–1 victory. The following season, with Orient now in the Second Division of the Football League, he only played for the reserve side but did make one appearance in the FA Cup on 7 October 1905 at Felstead, a 1–-1 draw before 250 spectators.Neilson N.

(pg. 272) Role in the Water Street revival Burns was one of several saloon keepers targeted during the public crusade against John Allen, then called the \\"Wickedest Man in New York\\", and it was soon reported in the press that he and others had been \\"reformed\\" by religious leaders and agreed to hold prayer meetings in their establishments. Though he had declined their offers several times, he eventually allowed his \\"rat pit\\" to be used for a high fee. It is claimed he rented out the building for one hour each week in exchange for $150.Sante, Luc. Low Life: Lures and Snares of Old New York. New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2003. (pg. 280) One such meeting held at Sportsman's Hall in September 1868 was described by the New York World, Burns later mocked the movement calling it \\"sheer humbug\\" and said, in reference to John Allen's holding an evangelical meeting in his establishment, \\"I've known Johnny Allen fourteen years and he couldn't be a pious man if he tried ever so hard. You might as well ask a rat to sing like a canary bird as to make a Christian out of that chap.\\" The general public became skeptical of these meetings at the \\"rat pit\\", and a public inquiry was made to investigate the relationship between Burns and the missionaries. It was Burns himself, however, that was the first to turn against them. He and the other Water Street dive keepers were angry at having been paid less than half what John Allen had received. One night, during a nightly meeting, he announced to reporters present that \\"them fellows have been making a pul-pit out of my rat pit and I'm going to purify it after them\\". Burns gave the signal and his barman began pelting the congregation of \\"ladies and clergymen\\" with rats while the regulars taunted the crowd with insults. Burns mandated a nightly show soon afterwards and \\"referred to his sacrament as one that 'ratified' the meetings\\". However, the hall operated a few weeks before the police shut the building down.Dowling, Robert M. Slumming in New York: From the Waterfront to Mythic Harlem. Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 2008. (pg. 29-30) Prompted by Henry Bergh, founder of the ASPCA, it was Burns' cruelty to animals that led to the final closing of Sportsman's Hall when it was raided on the night of November 31, 1870. It was recognized at the time as the city's largest dogfighting ringBeers, Diane L. For the Prevention of Cruelty: The History and Legacy of Animal Rights Activism in the United States. Athens, Ohio: Ohio University Press, 2006. (pg. 75-76) and, that same night, Burns held his last event in the rat pit. He offered 300 rats to be \\"given away, free of charge, for gentlemen to try their dogs with\\". It was this advertisement that caught the attention of Bergh and who personally led the raid. Burns and all involved were arrested for violation of an anti-animal cruelty law passed by the New York state legislature four years prior.Lane, Marion and Stephen Zawistowski. Heritage of Care: The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008. (pg. 25) Death Though everyone was acquitted at the trial, Burns caught a cold which developed into pneumonia and died on December 19, 1870, shortly before he was to go to trial. The funeral service at his South Brooklyn home was attended by \\"a motley crowd of young street urchins, grown-up rowdies, hard- faced men, 'sports' and women\\" who accompanied the funeral procession from Sackett Street to Calvary Cemetery where he was buried. His Water Street establishment was carried on by his son-in-law Richard Toner and the English rat-catcher Jack Jennings, but they closed Burn's infamous \\"rat pit\\" and instead turned Sportsman's Hall, or the \\"Band-Box\\", into a full-time saloon. His widow later stated her intentions to apply to the common council, or Judge Joseph Dowling, for compensation when police disposed of a cage filled with rats in the East River in a recent raid ordered by Police Commissioner Bergh. She also wanted damages for a bullpup, valued at $100, which was also seized by police during the raid. Although little of the original structure remains, Sportsman's Hall occupied the land where the Joseph Rose House and Shop, a four-unit luxury apartment house, now lies and is the third oldest house in Manhattan after St. Paul's Chapel and the Morris-Jumel Mansion.Bunyan, Patrick.

It is found in the juice of grapes (Vitis vinifera) and impacts the color of white wine. It is an esterified phenolic acid, composed of caffeic acid, a hydroxycinnamate produced by plants, and tartaric acid, the principal organic acid found in grape berries. As such, caftaric acid is found in all grape juices and wines. During alcoholic and malolactic fermentation, the ester can be enzymatically hydrolysed, releasing the two constituents. Caffeic acid is susceptible to chemical oxidation, and subsequent redox reactions involving caffeic acid can contribute to wine browning over time, and the straw-gold color that can develop in some white wines after bottling. Aside from wine, it is abundantly present in raisins. It also occurs in Cichorium intybus (common chicory) and is one of the bioactive components of Echinacea purpurea (Eastern purple coneflower). Caftaric acid has a good bioavailability when fed in rats. Intact trans-caftaric acid was detected in rat plasma along with its O-methylated derivative trans-fertaric acid.  In wine  Winemakers measure caftaric acid levels as their primary method to estimate the oxidation levels that a wine has undergone. For example, press wines, which undergo a high degree of oxidation, will have little to no caftaric acid. Grape reaction product (2-S glutathionyl caftaric acid) is an oxidation compound produced from caftaric acid and found in wine. Malvidin 3-glucoside alone is not oxidized in the presence of grape polyphenol oxidase (PPO), whereas it is degraded in the presence of a crude grape PPO extract and of caftaric acid, forming anthocyanidin-caftaric acid adducts.

Tadolini's husband was a close friend and admirer of the composer who was also living in Bologna at the time. In 1830, she sang in a soirée at Rossini's house there, the highlight of which was Rossini himself singing an aria from The Barber of Seville.The Harmonicon (1830) p. 352 She also sang Zoraide in Rossini's Ricciardo e Zoraide in its first performance at the Théâtre-Italien in Paris (23 October 1830). Although the Rossinian repertoire (including Rosina in The Barber of Seville) figured primarily in the earliest years of her career, she would later sing the title role in his Armida for a major revival at La Scala in 1836. By the summer of 1830, Eugenia and Giovanni Tadolini had settled in Paris where both were engaged at the Théâtre-Italien, she as a singer in a company that included Maria Malibran and Giuditta Pasta and he as maestro concertatore. Their marriage proved to be an unhappy one, however. The couple separated in 1833 and were divorced in 1834.Ashbrook (1983) p. 641 Following her separation from her husband, she returned to Italy where she was soon in great demand in that country's opera houses, singing leading roles at La Scala, La Fenice, the Teatro Regio di Torino, and the Teatro San Carlo, amongst others. Donizetti, Verdi, Bellini, and Mercadante heroines Eugenia Tadolini as Adina in Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore, a role to which she was particularly suited. Gaetano Donizetti said of Tadolini, \\"She is a singer, she is an actress, she is everything\\".Gaetano Donizetti quoted in Ashbrook (1983) p. 498 Tadolini's association with Donizetti began in 1831 when she sang the role of Giovanna Seymour in the premiere of the second version of Anna Bolena at The King's Theatre in London. She sang the role again at the Théâtre-Italien in Paris for its French premiere later that year. By 1842, she had graduated to singing the title role in Anna Bolena (at the Theater am Kärntnertor in Vienna). In that same year she sang the title role in world premiere of Donizetti's Linda di Chamounix which he wrote specifically for her voice. In 1843, she created the title role in his Maria di Rohan, again specifically written for her voice. She went on to sing in the Italian premieres of his Poliuto (as Paolina) and La Favorita (as Leonora). Her other notable Donizetti roles which she sang in some of their earliest performances included Eleonora in Il furioso all'isola di San Domingo (in its first performance at La Scala), the title role in Fausta, Pia in Pia de' Tolomei, Eleonora in L'esule di Roma, ossia Il proscritto, Antonina in Belisario, Elena in Marino Faliero, the title role in Maria Padilla, Gemma in Gemma di Vergy, Norina in Don Pasquale, and Adina in L'elisir d'amore. One of her earliest performances as Adina had been in Vienna in 1835. When she sang the role for the 1842 revival of L'elisir d'amore in Naples, Donizetti composed a completely new final cabaletta for her, \\"Obblia le tue pene\\".The cabaletta is not used in standard versions of the L'elisir d'amore score, but its music was later recycled by Donizetti as the duet \\"O caro sposino\\" in Don Pasquale. Pagannone (2003) p. 45. Note that Crutchfield (2009) proposes that the aria was written for Tadolini when she sang L'elisir in its 1835 Vienna premiere. An early admirer of Verdi,Sadie (1988) p. 749 she created the title role of Alzira in 1845 and sang in some of the earliest performances of four of his other operas: Griselda in I Lombardi alla prima crociata, Elvira in Ernani, Odabella in Attila, and Lady Macbeth in Macbeth. She in turn was admired by Verdi's wife, Giuseppina Strepponi, who termed her \\"one of the greatest talents we possess\\".Giuseppina Strepponi quoted in Ashbrook (1983) p. 641 In 1844 she sang in the Vienna premiere of Ernani after which, the composer heard (much to his annoyance) that she had substituted her Act I cavatina, \\"Ernani! Ernani, involami\\" with Giselda's cavatina \\"Non fu sogno\\" from I Lombardi alla prima crociata.Resigno (2001) p. 510 Nevertheless, the Vienna premiere was a resounding success, even without the original cavatina, and Verdi was determined to have her as his first Alzira. He even delayed the rehearsals until she recovered from the birth of her child. In 1848, however, he wanted her to be replaced as Lady Macbeth for the first Naples performance of Macbeth on the grounds that her voice and appearance were too beautiful.Rosenberg (July 2006). See also Riggs (2003) p. 192 In his often quoted letter to Salvadore Cammarano, which he wanted passed on to the Teatro San Carlo management, Verdi wrote: > You know how highly I regard Tadolini, and she herself knows it; but I > believe it's necessary — for the interest of all concerned. Tadolini's > qualities are far too good for that role! This may seem absurd to you!! ... > Tadolini has a beautiful and attractive appearance; and I would like Lady > Macbeth to be ugly and evil. Tadolini sings to perfection; and I would like > the Lady not to sing. Tadolini has a stupendous voice, clear, limpid, > powerful; and I would like the Lady to have a harsh, stifled, and hollow > voice. Tadolini's voice has an angelic quality; I would like the Lady's > voice to be diabolical.Giuseppe Verdi quoted in Gossett (5 November 2007) Despite Verdi's urging, and the best efforts of Cammarano, the theatre refused to replace her, as she was one of its reigning stars at the time. Verdi's view of her unsuitability for roles like Lady Macbeth was similar to that expressed 10 years earlier by Felice Romani who saw her in Bellini's La straniera. Although he praised the quality of her singing in the performance, and was a long time admirer of Tadolini, Romani found her lovely voice and appearance less than ideal for a role like Alaide: > She has too many gifts for Alaide, too much light in her beautiful eyes, too > much charm in her smile, for the mysterious Foreign Woman. Her voice full, > sweet, and embellished, is made for joy, for the love that consoles, for > afflictions borne with hope, not for torments and a stormy heart, not for > the ravings of a soul in anguish, not for the cries of despair.Original > Italian: \\"Ella ha troppe grazie per Alaide, troppa luce ne' suoi begli > occhi, troppi vezzi nel suo sorriso per la misteriosa Straniera. La sua voce > volubile, soave, fiorita, è fatta per la gioia, per l'amore che si può > consolare, per afflizioni rasserenate dalla speranza, non per gli strazii e > un cuore in tempesta, non pei delirii di un'anima angosciata, non per le > grida della disperazione. [...] Se a coronar la Straniera bastasse il merito > del solo canto, la Tadolini sarebbe coronata.\\" Romani (1837) p. 407.For > extravagant praise by Romani for both her acting and singing as Nina in > Coppola's La pazza per amore, and Adina in L'elisir d'amore, two roles to > which he thought her ideally suited, see Romani (1837) pp. 329 and 385. Tadolini sang several other Bellini heroines in addition to Alaide, most notably Elvira in I puritani, Imogene in Il pirata, the title role in Norma and Amina in La sonnambula.Casaglia (2005) and Riggs (2003) p. 170 Her Amina which she sang in Vienna, Paris, and several Italian theatres, was particularly admired.See for example, Martinez (1845) pp. 242-249 and Jahn (2004) p. 34 She was also closely associated with the operas of Saverio Mercadante. Tadolini sang in the world premieres of his Emma d'Antiochia, Le due illustri rivali, and Il bravo, ossia La veneziana and in the premiere of the revised version of Francesca Donato ossia Corinto distrutta, as well as in some of the earliest performances of his Il giuramento and Orazi e Curiazi. Mercadante had also written the role of Lea in La schiava saracena expressly for her voice. However, the outbreak of the 1848 Revolution in Milan aborted the premiere and forced the temporary closure of La Scala.The Musical world (1848) Volume 23, p. 306 Another soprano, Carlotta Gruitz, sang the role in its official premiere later that year.OperaGlass, \\"Role Creators in the Operas of Saverio Mercadante\\" Tadolini eventually sang Lea in 1850, for the premiere of the work's revised version at the Teatro San Carlo. Naples and London The Teatro San Carlo in Naples as it looked during the time that Tadolini sang there. From 1842, Eugenia Tadolini was primarily based at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples, although she still performed in other Italian theatres and abroad. She sang in the world premieres of at least 12 operas at the Teatro San Carlo, most of them now forgotten, apart from Verdi's Alzira and Donizetti's Poliuto. During that time, she also formed a relationship with a Neapolitan nobleman by whom she had two children, both of whom died in childhood.Rosselli (1992) p. 175 In the spring of 1848, she travelled to London for what the contemporary press often billed as her \\"debut\\", although she had appeared there in 1831 in the secondary role of Giovanna Seymour for the London premiere of Donizetti's Anna Bolena. This time she was returning as an established star and was to sing the title role in Linda di Chamounix opposite Sims Reeves at Her Majesty's Theatre. In the week prior to the opening of Linda di Chamounix, The Musical World printed an extract from a letter by The Times political correspondent in Italy, extolling her virtues (dated 26 March 1848): > Madame Tadolini, who, for the first time is about to appear in London, I am > sure will become a great favorite, as she possesses all qualities necessary > to captivate an English audience. She is inclined to embonpoint, but she is > very handsome on the stage, with dangerous eyes—the whitest shoulder in the > world—and a sense of enjoyment in her acting, which your audience will not > be able to resist. Tadolini's voice is a clear soprano-mezzo-soprano in its > richest quality, with an intonation that approaches, when necessary, to the > contralto. It is as clear as a bell, round, full, and sonorous, perfectly > flexible and capable of all those modulations which a great artist like her > dashes off, but which are so painful and difficult to thinner voices, and > less qualified science. I heard the prima donna to great disadvantage, as > she disdained to sing to an empty house (from political excitement),The > correspondent may have been referring to Five Days of Milan uprising that > aborted the premiere of Mercadante's La schiava saracena and used merely one > half of her powers. Her acting was equally restrained, but the inward spirit > could not be altogether subdued, and she occasionally broke forth into > silvery and impassioned notes, and abandoned herself to that natural gaiety > of song that rendered her in the scene the most captivating of coquettes. > Had Tadolini known that the Times has ears everywhere, she might have > exerted herself to please them; but criticism has art and judgment, and > though she sung at mezzo voce,The author is referring to mezza voce, an > Italian musical term meaning \\"half voice\\", i.e., singing with subdued or > moderated volume. it was not difficult to prognosticate complete success for > her at Her Majesty's Theatre.The Musical World, (1848) Volume 23, p. 306 While her reception at the opening night of Linda di Chamounix was very warm, it was not the ecstatic one predicted by the press. Sims Reeves' performance, on the other hand, was described as \\"triumphant\\".The Musical World, Volume 23, p. 339 Tadolini was nearly 40 at the time, and her voice may have been past its prime. However Ashbrook has suggested that her relative lack of success with the British public may be partly attributable to its obsession with Jenny Lind at the time.Ashbrook (1983) p. 641 While in London, she also sang Norina in Don Pasquale (again warmly, but not ecstatically, received) and participated in several concerts before returning to Naples. Later that year she sang in the Teatro San Carlo's first performance of Verdi's Attila and in the posthumous premiere of Donizetti's Poliuto. Final years Paris seen from Père Lachaise Cemetery Between 1849 and 1851, Tadolini sang in three world premieres at the Teatro San Carlo – as Elfrida in Puzone's Elfrida di Salerno (1849), as Caterina in Lillo's Caterina Howard (1849), and as Elfrida in De Giosa's Folco d'Arles (1851). During that time she also sang in the theatre's first performances of Verdi's Macbeth, Donizetti's La favorita, and Mercadante's La schiava saracena. She ventured out of her adopted city in December 1852 to sing Giselda in Verdi's I Lombardi alla prima crociata at the Teatro Metastasio in Prato. After that she retired from the stage and settled down in Naples with her only surviving child. He too would die three years later in the city's 1855-56 cholera epidemic. In 1860, Garibaldi and his troops invaded the city. King Francis II and his court fled to north to Gaeta. Tadolini and her current lover, a young Neapolitan prince, fled to Paris, where she spent the remaining 12 years of her life. Once she was settled in Paris, she wrote to her brother: > Long live Garibaldi for getting me here!...After my terrible misfortune, > this is the first time I feel alive. What life!Eugenia Tadolini's letter to > her brother quoted in Rosselli (1992) p. 175 At first she lived in an apartment on the Champs-Élysées, but worried that her money would run out, she later moved to less expensive quarters on the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré. In July 1872, she contracted typhoid fever and initially refused to see a doctor because it brought back memories of her children's deaths. Eugenia Tadolini died of the disease on 11 July 1872 at the age of 63 and was buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery.Tadolini's exact date of death and her performances during this period are from Casaglia. The remainder of the account of her final days in Naples and Paris is based on Rosselli (1992) p. 175, which is in turn based on Tadolini's correspondence preserved in the Piancastelli collection at the Biblioteca Civica di Forlì, and Battaglia (1979) pp. 151-163.

The directorial debut of fashion designer Tom Ford, the film stars Colin Firth, who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of George Falconer, a depressed, homosexual British university professor living in Southern California in 1962. The film premiered on September 11, 2009 at the 66th Venice International Film Festival, and went on the film festival circuit. After it screened at the 34th Toronto International Film Festival, The Weinstein Company picked it up for distribution in the United States and Germany. An initial limited run in the United States commenced on December 11, 2009, to qualify it for the 82nd Academy Awards with a wider release in early 2010.  Plot  On November 30, 1962, a month after the Cuban Missile Crisis, George Falconer is a middle-aged English college professor living in Los Angeles. George dreams that he encounters the body of his longtime partner, Jim, at the scene of the car accident that took Jim's life eight months earlier. He bends down to kiss his dead lover. After awakening, George delivers a voiceover discussing the pain and depression he has endured since Jim's death and his intention to commit suicide that evening. George receives a phone call from his dearest friend, Charley, who projects lightheartedness despite her also being miserable. George goes about his day putting his affairs in order and focusing on the beauty of isolated events, believing he is seeing things for the last time. At times, he recalls his sixteen-year-long relationship with Jim. During the school day George comes into contact with a student, Kenny Potter, who shows interest in George and disregards conventional boundaries of student-professor discussion. George also forms an unexpected connection with a Spanish male prostitute, Carlos. That evening George meets Charley for dinner. Though they initially reminisce and amuse themselves by dancing, Charley's desire for a deeper relationship with George and her failure to understand his relationship with Jim anger George. George goes to a bar and discovers that Kenny has followed him. They get a round of drinks, go skinny dipping, and then return to George's house and continue drinking. George passes out and wakes up in bed with Kenny asleep in another room. While watching Kenny, George discovers that he has fallen asleep holding George's gun, to keep George from committing suicide. George locks the gun away, burns his suicide notes and in a voiceover explains that he has rediscovered the ability \\"to feel, rather than think\\". As he makes peace with his grief, George suffers a heart attack and dies, while envisioning Jim appearing and kissing him.  Cast  Jon Hamm has an uncredited voice cameo as Jim's cousin Harold Ackerly, who calls George to tell him of Jim's death and that the funeral is \\"just for family.\\"  Production  Fashion designer Tom Ford, as a first-time director, financed the film himself. The film places emphasis on the culture of the 1960s; the production design is by the same team that designed AMC television's Mad Men, which is set in the same era. Mad Men star Jon Hamm has an uncredited voice cameo as the cousin of George's partner, Jim. The actual house where the character George lives in the film was designed in 1948 by John Lautner, his first house after leaving Frank Lloyd Wright.According to Tom Ford's director commentary on the DVD. Retrieved October 10, 2010. The film was shot in 21 days, according to \\"The Making of A Single Man\\", a featurette included on the DVD release of the film.  Marketing controversy  An early theatrical poster for A Single Man featured a close-up shot of Colin Firth and Julianne Moore lying side by side, their arms and shoulders touching. This led to speculation that the work's gay content and themes were being deleted or diminished in its marketing materials to improve its chances of success with a wider audience. A new poster with Moore relocated to the background was issued. The film's original trailer placed more emphasis on the relationship between George and Jim but a re-cut trailer omitted a shot of George and Jim kissing while retaining a kiss between George and Charley. Also deleted were a shot of George staring into a male student's eyes, while keeping a shot of George staring into the eyes of a female student, shots of George meeting hustler Carlos outside a liquor store, and shots of George and Kenny running nude into the ocean. Speaking of the controversy, Moore said that director Tom Ford expressed concern that the original poster made the film appear to be a romantic comedy and that he ordered that the poster be changed. However Ford, noting he does not see the film in terms of gay or straight, said, \\"I don't think the movie's been de-gayed. I have to say that we live in a society that's pretty weird. For example, you can have full-frontal male nudity on HBO, yet in cinema, you can't have naked male buttocks. You can't have men kissing each other without it being considered adult content. So, in order to cut a trailer that can go into broad distribution in theaters, certain things had to be edited out. But it wasn't an intentional attempt to remove the gayness of the movie.\\" Conversely, Colin Firth said, \\"[The marketing] is deceptive. I don't think they should do that because there's nothing to sanitize. It's a beautiful story of love between two men and I see no point in hiding that. People should see it for what it is.\\" Harvey Weinstein would only say, when asked about marketing a gay romance, \\"Brokeback Mountain did pretty well. Midnight Cowboy did pretty well. If you know how to market, you can market. There's an audience for it.\\" When pressed about the poster, Weinstein cut off the interview, saying, \\"I'm good. You got enough. Thank you.\\" Peter Knegt of Indiewire suggested that The Weinstein Company \\"de-gayed\\" the trailer to better the film's chances of receiving Academy Award nominations.  Reception   Critical response  Red carpet with Matthew Goode, Tom Ford, Julianne Moore, Colin Firth, Nicholas Hoult and Jon Kortajarena at 66th Venice Film Festival. The film has received an overall positive reception from critics, with most reviews singling out Colin Firth's performance. It currently holds an 85% \\"Fresh\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 192 reviews, and an average rating of 7.39/10, with the site's consensus being that \\"Though the costumes are beautiful and the art direction impeccable, what stands out most from this debut by fashion designer Tom Ford is the leading performance by Colin Firth.\\" Metacritic has compiled an average score of 77 (generally favorable reviews) from 35 critic reviews. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune wrote \\"Some films aren't revelations, exactly, but they burrow so deeply into old truths about love and loss and the mess and thrill of life, they seem new anyway\\" Bob Mondello of NPR commented \\"An exquisite, almost sensual grief suffuses every frame of A Single Man.\\" Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle wrote \\"Everything fits perfectly, from titles to fin, but most of all Colin Firth, who dons the role of George like a fine bespoke suit.\\" Critics who liked the film include The A.V. Club film critic Nathan Rabin, who gave the film an A- score, arguing that \\"A Single Man is a film of tremendous style wedded to real substance, and rooted in \\"Firth's affecting lead performance as a man trying to keep it together for one last day after his world has fallen apart.\\" Critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times also praised Firth, saying that he \\"plays George superbly, as a man who prepares a face to meet the faces that he meets. He betrays very little emotion, and certainly his thoughts cannot be read in his eyes.\\" The Times newspaper of London called the film \\"a thing of heart-stopping beauty . . . There will be critics who will be unable to get past the director's background, but rest assured: Tom Ford is the real deal.\\" Variety's verdict: \\"Luminous and treasurable, despite its imperfections. An impressive helming debut for fashion designer Tom Ford.\\"  Accolades  The film was nominated for the Golden Lion at the 66th Venice International Film Festival and won the festival's third annual Queer Lion. Colin Firth was awarded the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the film festival for his performance in the film. He received a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Firth also received Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild and Academy Award nominations for Best Actor. For her performance, Julianne Moore was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress in Motion Picture.

He played college football at Colgate University was selected as a first-team All-American in 1916 at quarterback. Anderson later played professional football for the Buffalo All-Americans of the American Professional Football Association (APFA)—now known as the National Football League (NFL). He was one of the leading scorers in the 1920 and 1921 APFA seasons. Biography Colgate University Anderson was born in Erie, Pennsylvania and attended Colgate University. All-American quarterback Anderson played quarterback for Colgate from 1914 to 1916. He was considered one of the best forward passers of his era. Following a 1914 game between Syracuse and Colgate, the Syracuse Herald praised Anderson's passing ability: > \\"Quarterback Anderson, one of tho slipperiest men who has been seen in the > Syracuse stadium and a mighty clever general, proved himself to be an expert > in throwing the forward pass, his aim being wonderfully accurate. When he > raced back five yards and turned, he usually found his man with one quick > glance and then heaved the ball to within a few feet of where he was.\\" During Anderson's time as quarterback at Colgate, the team compiled a record of 23–5–2. He led the 1916 Colgate football team to an 8–1 record as the team outscored its opponents 218–30. Colgate beat strong teams from Illinois (15–3), Syracuse (15–0), and Brown (28–0), but lost a close game against Yale (7–3) in New Haven. At the end of the 1916 season, Anderson was selected as a first-team All-American by Walter Camp, the International News Service, and The Boston Post. One critic wrote the following about the selection of Anderson as the first-team All-American quarterback for 1916: > \\"[A]fter the Colgate-Brown game, a struggle between two of the best football > teams of the east, the experting fellow found Anderson, of Colgate, standing > out as a brilliant star. Anderson is a field general of admitted ability. He > has shown rare judgment in directing his attack in every game in which he > appeared this year. He's fast, a good groundgainer both through the line and > in the open, and he can boot the ball when called upon to do so, although > several other members of his team did their share of toeing the pigskin this > year.\\" Nationally syndicated sports writer Tommy Clark chose Anderson not only as his first-team All-American at quarterback, but also named Anderson to act as captain of the All-American team. Clark explained his selection of Anderson as follows: > \\"Carl Anderson of Colgate is selected to play quarter and to act as captain > of the All American eleven. He has been a star at Colgate for three seasons. > He is an accurate forward paser, and his passing gave Colgate the 13-0 > victory over the Army last season. He is a good broken field runner, and his > running back of punts has been a feature of several games this year. He > feeds his backs in faultless style, the result being that Colgate did not > fumble at Yale, only once against Illinois, and that on a direct pass, and > not once against Syracuse and Brown. Anderson has played against some of the > best quarterbacks of the year, Macomber of Illinois, Smith of Yale and > Meehan of Syracuse. None of them outplayed him.\\" All-around athlete in five sports Anderson was an all-around athlete who competed in five sports for Colgate. In February 1917, The Washington Post ran a feature story on Anderson's diverse athletic abilities. The Post wrote: > \\"As is the case with most football men of unusual abilltv, Carl Anderson, of > Colgate, all-American quarterback by almost universal choice, is a great > all-around athlete. He has won his letter at football, track and basketball > and is a hockey and baseball star. However, he is so anxious to overcome > this and to make his letter in five sports that he now has reported for the > hockey team and will give up track work in the spring in favor of baseball. > He is not only a brilliant sprinter, as his football work would indicate, > but is also a clever hurdler and can jump 21 feet in the broad jump. Last > year in the dual meets he twice was clocked in ten seconds for the 100 and > 22 flat for the 220.\\" Anderson has been inducted into the Colgate University Athletics Hall of Honor. Military service and athletic director Anderson later served in the military during World War I, including service in France. In November 1917, Anderson led the Camp Dix national army football team to a 19–0 win over Camp Devens in a game played in Boston. In the second quarter, Anderson ran 70 yards around right end for a touchdown. A few minutes later, he caught a punt and \\"sprinted 60 yards for another score.\\" After the war, he worked as an athletic director in the Erie, Pennsylvania school system. Buffalo All- Americans In August 1920, the National Football League (NFL), known in its first two seasons as the American Professional Football Association (APFA), was formed in Canton, Ohio. Anderson signed on to play for the Buffalo All- Americans. In the 1920 APFA season, the inaugural season of the league, Anderson helped Buffalo to a 9–1–1 record, rotating between quarterback and running back with Tommy Hughitt. Anderson was the league's second leading scorer in 1920. Though individual statistics for the 1920 season are unofficial, historical accounts indicate that Anderson scored 11 touchdowns and either 69 or 71 points.[Total Football: The Official Encyclopedia of the National Football League ()] Whether his point total was 69 or 71, Anderson's scoring in 1920 exceeded the total scoring of at least four teams—the Detroit Heralds (53), Chicago Tigers (49), This is a good article. Follow the link for more information. 1920 Columbus Panhandles season|Columbus Panhandles (41), and Cleveland Tigers (28). The only player with a higher point total than Anderson in the 1920 season was Dutch Sternaman of Decatur. In the 1921 APFA season, Buffalo was again one of the best teams in the league with a record of 9–1–2. That year, Anderson led the league with seven touchdowns and tied for second in scoring with 42 points. Teammate Elmer Oliphant led the league in scoring with 47 points. Anderson suffered a knee injury and played only sparingly in the 1922 NFL season. His last game was a 3–3 tie against the Akron Pros in November 1922. Later years Anderson retired from football after the 1922 season. Anderson resided in Tonawanda, New York from 1922 until his death in 1962. In 1933, he entered the hardware business with his father- in-law, H. B. Koenig. He became the president of H.B. Koenig, Inc. In his later life, Anderson suffered from emphysema, reportedly the result of smoking and the effect of poisonous gas inhaled in France during World War I. Anderson died in 1962 at Buffalo General Hospital. He was survived by his wife, the former Mildred K. Koenig and a son, Robert H. Anderson.

Xavier received formal Jazz-Pop bass training at the Cégep Marie-Victorin school in Montreal. His first release was the indie-punk album Mal éduqué mon amour in 1998 sung entirely in French. The follow up album Pornstar was released in 2000, leaning toward a more glam rock sound, with English lyrics. Xavier formed a band called Poxy and released their self-titled album in 2004, followed by Artificial Pleasures in 2007. In August 2006, he released Gisèle on Indica Records as a solo project. Once again Xavier wrote the music, sang and performed most of the instruments on his album. Additional drums were recorded by his friend Michel Langevin of Voivod. Gisèle considered a classic French-language punk rock album, earning two ADISQ 2007 nominations for \\"Best Rock Album of the Year\\" and \\"Best Male Artist\\", and winning the GAMIQ 2007 award for \\"Best Rock Album\\". The Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada awarded him the \\"2008 Discovery of the Year Song\\" award for \\"La fin du monde\\". Cafeine's most recent album New Love was released again on Indica Records in 2013. The album was produced by Gus Van Go, giving the sound a crisper, more modern electro-punk-pop-rock sound. Singles \\"New Love\\", \\"Electric\\" and \\"L'ettre D'Amour\\" each reached the top 15 French-Canadian Commercial Alternative Radio BDS charts. New Love was primarily recorded in English with alternate French language versions for \\"Electric\\" and \\"L'ettre D'Amour\\".

As a live performer, Cafeine is known for his high-octane-punk intensity. Le Journal de Québec quoted \\"he is still a beast on stage\\" referencing Toronto's alternative weekly NOW Magazine who declared \\"Cafeine is amazing, what a beast on stage\\". Established as a beloved personality, Cafeine regularly makes live appearances on French-Canadian music television such as Radio-Canada Television's show Stereopop or MusiquePlus specials such as Pop de jam.https://www.facebook.com/MusiquePlus/videos/10155848392400478/ In 2007, Belgian singer Plastic Bertrand contacted him to collaborate on the writing and composing of his new album \\"Dandy Bandit\\".

Before prepaid phone service, you had the choice of only signing up with your local telephone company for home phone service. Examples of local telephone companies were the big Bell companies such as Southwestern and Pacific Bell, Alltel and GTE. If you were unable to pay your phone bill with your local telephone company you would be disconnected and you would not be able to establish new telephone service in your name until the old bill was paid in full and possibly a deposit was made in the range of $100.00–$500.00 depending on your outstanding bill amount. Bills could be run up due to collect, long-distance charges, 1-900 number charges or other toll charges that could have been made by you, someone in your household including your children, or a visiting friend or relative. In some cases, home phone service could not be established at the address where the disconnected service had existed even if service was being applied for in a different name. Alltel was one of the telephone companies that did not allow service to be established at a specific address if there was a past due unpaid delinquent bill showing on their records at that address until the delinquent charges were paid for in full; regardless if the new service application was in a different name. Comm South Companies was created and opened for business in the late 1990s. They offered prepaid home phone service to anyone regardless of credit, past due bills, or proof of identity. When the company started all dial tone lines were completely blocked meaning that only local telephone calls could be made and no collect, 900, or other toll calls could be made. If you wanted to call long distance you would be required to buy a prepaid long-distance card from a local store. Over time, Comm South Companies acquired a long-distance plan which would allow you to make long-distance calls from your home phone which was prepaid. Each bill you received from Comm South was a bill for the next month of service and the due date was before that next month of service which is why the service was prepaid before you even used it to prevent people from running up high bills and not paying. The monthly service charges were anywhere from $65.00 to $100.00 per month depending on what features you wanted. They offered most of the features you could get from the normal local phone companies such as caller ID, call waiting, three way calling, speed dial, call blocker, and call waiting ID. Comm South did allow payment arrangements/extensions if you were unable to pay your bill by the due date but the payment extension was never allowed beyond only a week or two. If you were disconnected for non payment by Comm South, it was never reflected on your credit report because a) it was prepaid service and b) you didn't have to use your real name or social security number. Comm South Companies grew very quickly, so quickly in fact that their Customer Service department began to remain open 24 hours a day and had very long hold times. The old telephone number for Customer Service was 1-800-936-5223 and the billing address was in Dallas, Texas; their old website was www.commsouth.com. Comm South Companies had established local telephone service for millions of Americans who could not get home phone service due to an outstanding balance with their local telephone company. By the year 2003 so many other companies had been created to \\"cash in\\" on this type of service and on people who needed home phone service but were unable to get it that Comm South became just one out of several different choices for prepaid home phone service and Comm South Companies went out of business and filed for Bankruptcy. Their customers were not disconnected when the company went out of business, they were simply transferred to other prepaid home phone service providers such as DPI Teleconnect. Comm South Companies however will always be one of the first telephone companies to provide home phone service to Americans who could not get a home phone with their local telephone company. They created a market and provided service to people when no one else would and will always be remembered as doing so. Comm South Companies, Inc opened the door for this type of service that will be in place for many years to come.

According to Stefan Bielinski, former senior historian of the New York State Museum, the charter is also \\"arguably the longest-running instrument of municipal government in the Western Hemisphere.\\" In 1936 the United States Congress commemorated the charter's 250th anniversary by minting a half dollar coin. History After the city of New York received a municipal charter from Governor Dongan the governor came to Albany, at which time the village sent a delegation of prominent men to request a charter of their own. The Patroon, after being encouraged by the governor, finally released all claims to Albany and forfeited a strip of land wide and long to Albany. Albany at the time consisted of about 500 residents living in around 140 houses. In July 1686 a delegation led by Pieter Schuyler and Robert Livingston traveled to New York to receive the charter for Albany; the charter was signed on July 25, 1686 and was read aloud to the citizens of Albany three days later. Due to England, and by extension Albany, using the Julian calendar at the time, the corrected date for the signing of the document under the Gregorian calendar is August 1, 1686. During Leisler's Rebellion Jacob Leisler demanded the charters of Albany and the city of New York be forfeited, and New York yielded but Albany's mayor, Pieter Schuyler, refused. Schuyler went on to become one of the major leaders in suppressing the rebellion. The next major threat to the charter government came during the American Revolution when the Common Council stopped meeting in 1775. The local Committee of Safety took over daily functions until 1778 when the Common Council began meeting again. A Dongan Charter Parade was held in 1936 for the 250th anniversary celebrations, and as part of the ceremonies the United States Congress authorized the minting of an Albany Charter half dollar coin. Tricentennial celebrations held in 1986 included a re-enactment of the signing and awarding of the charter by Governor Mario Cuomo playing Governor Dongan, and Mayor Thomas Whalen playing Mayor Schuyler. Other events during the tricentennial were fireworks, music, the unveiling of a tricentennial clock, a hot-air balloon lift-off from Lincoln Park, and a cake large enough to feed thousands. Mayors from other Albanys around the world were among the visiting dignitaries who were invited to the ceremonies and given a tour of the city by Mayor Whalen. Provisions The original Dongan Charter partially unfolded The charter turned the village of Albany into a city under the name of \\"The Mayor, Aldermen, and Commonalty of the city of Albany\\";. This legally separated it from Rensselaerswyck, a nearby colonial estate. The charter also established Albany's boundaries and a municipal government, as well as specifically naming the first officers. Certain special rights were put into the charter as well, such as the exclusive right to negotiate with the Native Americans. It also established Albany as the sole market town in the upper Hudson region, with the right to purchase land at Tionnderoge and Schaghticoke. The mayor of Albany was the executive officer and selected by the Lieutenant Governor. He was also designated as the clerk of the marketplace and the coroner for both the city and Albany County. Two aldermen and two assistant aldermen were chosen from each ward and sat on the Common Council along with the mayor and recorder. The mayor, recorder, and aldermen were also justices, the assistants however did not have any judicial powers. The sole right to issue trading privileges anywhere in Albany County rested with the mayor and Common Council. Albany County encompassed all of Upstate New York north and west of Ulster County at that time, as well as the state of Vermont. All residents of New York, except those of Albany, were specifically banned from trading with any Iroquois nation, or with any other native tribe to the west, east, or north of the city of Albany, or with native tribes anywhere within Albany County. Amendments The Dongan Charter was first amended on March 21, 1787 to remove the mayor's powers to act as the city and county's sole coroner, and to regulate trade with Indians. It continued to be used with only minor changes until March 16, 1870, when it saw major changes by the state legislature in 1870 and 1883. In the 1870 revision, the city's official name was changed from \\"The Mayor, Aldermen, and Commonalty of the city of Albany\\" to the \\"City of Albany\\". In 1998, the charter was almost completely rewritten after a municipal referendum. Legally, however, the revised charter was reckoned as an amendment to the Dongan Charter. Commemorative coin The United States Congress authorized on June 16, 1936 the minting of 25,000 half dollar coins celebrating the 250th anniversary of the Dongan Charter.

Kennedy that was released September 14, 2009, by Twelve, a division of the Hachette book group.Kennedy Memoir Reveals Remorse Over Fatal Chappaquiddick Crash, Fox News, September 3, 2009 History Ted Kennedy signed up to do the book in the autumn of 2007. Kennedy received a reported $8 million advance for the work. It was written with the help of Pulitzer Prize-winning collaborator Ron Powers and was based on contemporaneous notes taken by Kennedy throughout his life, hours of recordings for an oral history project, and long interviews. Despite the collaboration, Kennedy literary representative Robert Barnett said that \\"every word\\" in the work was Kennedy's. Kennedy's editor, Jonathan Karp, later said that \\"it was very clear from the outset that he was setting out to write a work of history, a work of personal history, and that he wanted this book very much to be a legacy.\\" After he received his brain cancer diagnosis in 2008, Kennedy halted work on the book for a while, but then returned to it with renewed vigor and as one of his top priorities. He died the day a final copy of his book was delivered to his Hyannis Port, Massachusetts home. The work was originally intended for publication in 2010, then moved up to October 2009, and then finally moved up to September 2009, less than a month after Kennedy's death. A Twelve spokesperson said, \\"The book was completed earlier this summer. Our original publication date was October 6. We’d always hoped to publish sooner. The production process moved faster than expected, so we were able to shave off some time.\\" After The New York Times obtained the book before its publication date and released some information about it, the Twelve spokesperson said he was \\"dismayed\\" that the Times had obtained it and that \\"we regret that the New York Times did not respect the September 14th release date of 'True Compass', which was carefully coordinated with the senator's family. That copy was obtained without consent or permission from Twelve – or if it was somehow purchased, then it was sold illegally.\\" True Compass had an announced first printing of 1.5 million copies. Themes The memoir deals with Kennedy's experiences with the assassination of his two older brothers, John and Robert, the Chappaquiddick incident in 1969, his battle with drinking and with brain cancer, why he decided to run for president in 1980, his personal and professional relationships with various U.S. presidents, including his often tense, strained with Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, and his lifelong fight for universal health care. A broader theme of the book is, in the words of The New York Times's Michiko Kakutani, \\"that persistence, perseverance and patience in pursuit of a cause or atonement for one’s failures can lead to achievement and the possibility of redemption.\\" Critical and commercial reception In his review for the Saturday Age, Guy Rundle wrote that the memoir \\"follows the party line\\" when discussing the various scandals that \\"marked\\" Kennedy's long career in the Senate. He thought it was useful in documenting the campaigns that Kennedy ran in the 1970s and 1980s. Jonathan Yardley for The Washington Post said that \\"Kennedy [seeks] to be modest about the successes in his long public life and honest about the failures\\" but that \\"like virtually all political autobiographies these days, it has the air of having been written by committee. ... It is not always possible to tell where Kennedy's voice ends and that of his capable collaborator, Ron Powers, begins.\\" The Washington Times said that \\"Kennedy has produced a revelatory – though not tabloidesque – account of his storied life and career. While the Massachusetts Democrat was not without ego, he is willing to share the credit both with colleagues and family members for his successes and isn't shy about accepting blame for his many mistakes.\\" Former television anchor Roger Mudd took issue with Kennedy's version of their 1979 CBS interview which famously did damage to his 1980 presidential bid. Mudd said there was no deceit about the purpose or context of the interviews, as Kennedy claimed in the book, and wrote that \\"I remain mystified, perplexed, angered, and saddened that the senator would have endorsed such a false account in what amounted to his last testament.\\" True Compass sold 170,000 copies during its first five days of publication, and debuted at number one on the New York Times Best Seller list. By mid-December 2009, the book has had total sales of some 400,000 copies and has spent 13 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller list. An e-book edition was scheduled for release on Christmas Day 2009. However, a planned paperback edition was pushed back to 2011 due to the renewed vigor of the hardcover book's sales following a November 2009 appearance by widow Victoria Reggie Kennedy on The Oprah Winfrey Show.

Meteor saw extensive service throughout World War I, maintaining continuous operations both as a convoy escort and in harbour protection. Construction Meteor was one of a pair of destroyers ordered from Thornycroft & Company as part of the 1913–14 construction programme for the Royal Navy. The two ships, Meteor and , were to a modified design tendered by Thornycroft which was more powerful and faster than the standard Admiralty design. In order to speed construction, initial payments were made prior to the formal order being placed.Gardiner and Grey 1985, p. 77.

Meteor was long overall, with a beam of and a draught of .Gardiner and Grey 1985, p. 76. Displacement was normal and deep load.Friedman 2009, p. 296. Four Yarrow three-drum boilers fed two sets of Parsons steam turbines rated at , giving a design speed of . Up to 202 tons of oil could be carried, giving an endurance of at . The ship's crew consisted of 82 officers and men. Armament consisted of three QF Mk IV guns mounted on the ships centreline, and four 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in two twin mounts. In 1917, Meteor was converted to a minelayer, being capable of carrying 40 mines.Smith 2005, pp. 22, 26. Service history Meteor served with the Harwich Force 1914–1917. On 17 October 1914 Meteor was taking part in a regular patrol with the light cruiser (flying the flag of Reginald Tyrwhitt, commander of the Harwich Force) and the destroyers , and on the Broad Fourteens in the Southern North Seas, when suspicious radio signals were received by Lawford. The force soon intercepted the and when Meteor approached the German ship for boarding and inspection it was observed that Ophelias commander, Dr. Pfeiffer, threw overboard a number of documents and secret codes. Ophelia was seized by the British as a spy ship and renamed SS Huntly. On 23 January 1915, the German battlecruisers under Admiral Franz von Hipper made a sortie to attack British fishing boats on the Dogger Bank. British Naval Intelligence was warned of the raid by radio messages decoded by Room 40, and sent out the Battlecruiser Force from Rosyth, commanded by Admiral Beatty aboard and the Harwich Force, commanded by Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt aboard the light cruiser were sent out to intercept the German force. Meteor was one of seven M-class destroyers sailing with the Harwich Force.Corbett 1920, pp. 84–86.Massie 2007, pp. 375–380. The British and German Forces met on the morning of 24 January in the Battle of Dogger Bank. On sighting the British, Hipper ordered his ships to head south-east to escape the British, who set off in pursuit.Massie 2007, p. 385. Being the fastest destroyers available to the British, the seven M-class were sent ahead to report the strength of the German forces. Although briefly forced to turn away by fire from the armoured cruiser , they managed to successfully report the German's strength and course before being ordered to pull back and take up station ahead of the British line as Beatty's battlecruisers came into gun range of the German ships.Corbett 1920, pp. 88–89. At about 09:20, German destroyers appeared to be preparing a torpedo attack, and the British destroyers were ordered ahead of the line in order to prevent such an attack. Only the M-class destroyers had sufficient speed to respond and slowly draw ahead of the British battlecruisers, but no attack by German destroyers followed.Corbett 1920, pp. 91–92.Massie 2007, pp. 389–390. Later, at about 11:00, an emergency turn to avoid a non-existent German submarine and misinterpretation of signals from Lion caused the British battlecruisers to concentrate on Blücher, already badly damaged and trailing well behind the other German ships, and allowing the rest of Hipper's fleet to escape.Corbett 1920, pp. 95–97.Massie 2007, pp. 4010–402. Meteor led three other destroyers in a torpedo attack against Blücher but was hit by a shell in the forward boiler room which knocked her out of action, killing four and wounding two. Blücher was eventually overwhelmed by British shells and torpedoes, sinking at 12:10, while Meteor was towed back to the Humber by the destroyer .Corbett 1920, pp. 97–98, 101. By June 1915, Meteor had joined the 10th Destroyer Flotilla, and was part of the escort for three minelayers, that laid a field of 1450 mines in the North Sea on 10 September 1915.Corbett 1923, pp. 127–128. Meteor was part of the escort for the seaplane carrier when Vindex launched an unsuccessful air attack against a German Zeppelin base believed to be at Hoyer in Schleswig- Holstein on 25–25 March 1916. Only two out of five seaplanes dispatched returned, reporting that the Zeppelin base was in fact at Tondern, but that they were unable to attack the base. Two German patrol boats were sunk by ships of the escort which were searching for the missing seaplanes, but the destroyer was rammed and badly damaged by and eventually had to be scuttled, while the cruisers and also collided, badly damaging Undaunted.Corbett 1923, pp. 290–296. On the night of 23/24 January 1917, the Harwich Force was ordered to intercept a German destroyer flotilla that was being transferred to Zeebrugge, with Meteor part of a group of destroyers patrolling off the River Maas. The German destroyers ran into a cruiser division, with the destroyer heavily damaged, but the Germans managed to escape, and the British destroyers, including Meteor dispersed from their patrol positions after hearing the noise of the engagement, allowing the German ships to slip through. One German straggler, encountered a British destroyer patrol and sank the destroyer before escaping.Newbolt 1928, pp. 73–79.

It is administratively subdivided into 15 Union Councils, two of which form the Tehsil capital Sahiwal.Tehsils & Unions in the District of Sargodha - Government of Pakistan The population of the city is 236,000 (2015 estimate) most being Muslim and speak the Punjabi language.

History, Geography and Background According to the research of the archeologists, Tehsil Sahiwal is settled before BC. But it continued to deteriorate with the passage of time. Its centuries-old ruins, mounds and other artifacts proving that this region was repeatedly destroyed; however, the present city Sahiwal was inhibited about 570 years ago. The tribe Jhammat was inhibited here for the last 22 generations, and Sahiwal was named after the name of a person Sahi of Jhammat Tribe. Two hundred years later after the establishment of city Sahiwal another Baloch tribe dominated here, it entered into the region from Arabia via Iran (Khorasan). There are six gates at the intersection of the city that are renowned for their architecture. These doors are called Lahori Darvaza that is known as Khooni Darvaza( When Ranjeet Singh invaded the city and bloodshed occurred near the Lahori Gate so it was called Khooni Gate), Kashmiri Darvaza (Door), Peshawari Darvaza also called Jhammati Darvaza, Kabli Darvaza, Mastana Dargahi Darvaza, and Multani Darvaza. Now Sahiwal city has spread, however, the old city is surrounded by a strong wall and only the inner gates of the city have to be used for mobility. The walls and entrances around the city remain for centuries due to strong and ancient architecture but due to unlawful encroachment by the citizens the beauty of the city has faded. Before the emergence of Pakistan, Sahiwal was the center of Hindu traders. Hindu community lived along with Muslims in it and there were many temples and Hindu worship places in the city. The idols in the dunes and ruins also indicate that Hinduism was the earliest religion of the region. After the emergence of Pakistan, the Hindus migrated to India but their worship places and houses of the Hindu community are still here. Sahiwal was considered the only city where the tombs belonging to the Hindus still exist. An exploration of history reveals that Sher Shah Soori was here in the pursuit of Hamayun and stayed here and during his stay, he constructed a Mosque, later it was known as Sher Shah Soori Mosque. Geographically, Sahiwal was spread on a big area consisting of three big mounds was located on the brink of River Jhelum. The name of the biggest mound of the ruins were known as Panj Peer, and there was a sitting place of a saint named Hayat Almeer on top of Mound. The second mound interprets 2500 old cultures of the city whereas the third mound is called Gardwani Marri having much ancient Hindu civilization. After digging there were found signs of Hindu Temples, shrines, and residential areas. According to archeologists the city Sahiwal was already inhibited when Alexander attacked the subcontinent. The inhabitants of the destroyed city together with the army of Raja Porus tried to stop the mounting steps of Alexander the Great. Being on the brink of river Jhelum, people used to farm, transaction occurs under the Barter System. On the West side of the dunes, there were signs of a huge cave which was supposedly the entrance door to the wrecked city. Despite the public humiliation and climatic change, there is still a 70-foot high mound there. With reference to history, Nehang, an area of Sahiwal has much importance. Tibba Panj Peer situated in Nehang was denoted by the name of renowned saint Hayat Almeer. The place Panj Peer was the center of attention for the people, furthermore, an Urs has been celebrated here on January 15, 16 every year. There are 9 yards graves besides Hayat Almeer. It is interesting to note there saints were not tall in stature but the pilgrims of Panj Peer used to make long graves to highlight the importance of their Saints. For Hindus, these graves had much importance because of their faith they used to attribute them to five Pandas. =Administration= The Tehsil of Sahiwal is administratively subdivided into 15 Union Councils, these are:  Notable people  * Sardar Shafqat Khan Baloch - Ex MNA * Ali Asghar Lahri - MPA and ex Tehsil Nazim * Pir Hameeduddin Sialvi - Political leader and \\"Sajjadah Nasheen\\" of Sial Sharif * Nawabzada Ilyas Qureshi - Ex- MPA and Advisor to Chief Minister * Khalid Amir Khan - Ex- MPA and Ambassador * Rai Haq Nawaz Dhudy -retired Polo player * Rai Fateh Sher Dhudy - Ex-Member of District Council Sargodha District, Tent-pegging player * Syed Nusrat Ali Shah - Ex-Federal Minister = Gallery = One of the Gates of Sahiwal City, Built during Mughal era 14th-century Mosque in Sahiwal Ancient Hindu Mandir (Temple) in Sahiwal City = References = Category:Sargodha District Category:Tehsils of Punjab, Pakistan Category:Populated places in Sargodha District ","title":"Sahiwal Tehsil, Sargodha"},{"id":"24207782","text":"The Free Trade Union, later known as the Free Trade League, was a British trade organisation extant between July 1903 and the 1970s.

The Jews of Regensburg are part of Bavarian Jewry; Regensburg was the capital of the Upper Palatinate and formerly a free city of the German empire. The great age of the Jewish community in this city is indicated by the tradition that a Jewish colony existed there before the common era; it is undoubtedly the oldest Jewish settlement in Bavaria of which any records exist. Early history The earliest historical reference to Jews in Ratisbon (Regensburg) is in a document of 981, where it is stated that the monastery of St. Emmeram bought a piece of property from the Jew Samuel (Aronius, \\"Regesten\\", No. 135). The Jewish quarter, \\"Judæorum habitacula\\", is mentioned as early as the beginning of the 11th century (1006–28), and is the oldest German ghetto to which there is any reference in historical sources (Aronius, l.c. No. 150). The Jews were granted their first privileges there in a charter of 1182. Therein Emperor Frederick I. confirmed the rights they had received by the favor of his predecessors, and assigned to them, as to their coreligionists throughout the empire, the status of chamber servants (see Kammer knechtschaft). But their political position became complicated later by the circumstance that the emperor transferred them to the dukes of Lower Bavaria without releasing them from their obligations as chamber servants. To these overlords the Jews of Ratisbon were pawned in 1322 for the yearly sum of 200 pounds of Ratisbon pfennigs, but they were also subject to taxation by the municipal council of the city, though they received some compensation in the fact that thereby they secured the protection of the city council against the excessive demands of the emperor and the dukes. :(see image) Interior of the Old Synagogue at Ratisbon (from a drawing by Altdorfer)  History of the community  During the first Crusade (1096) the community suffered like many others in Germany. An old chronicle says with reference to the persecutions that took place in Franconia and Swabia in 1298 : \\"The citizens of Ratisbon desired to honor their city by forbidding the persecution of the Jews or the slaying of them without legal sentence.\\" The wave of fanaticism which swept over Germany in 1349 was checked at Ratisbon, in a similar spirit, by the declaration of the magistrates and the citizens that they would protect and defend their Jews. The municipal council again shielded them by punishing only the guilty when, in 1384, a riot occurred because some Jews had been convicted of giving false returns of their property to the tax-assessor. The protestations of the magistrates, however, could not protect their wards against the exactions of the emperor Wenzel when (1385–90) he replenished his purse by contributions levied upon the German Jews. In the following years they were again heavily taxed by both emperor and dukes, and in 1410 the magistrates, tired of ineffectual protest, took part in the game of spoliation by making an agreement with the duke that the Jews should pay 200 florins a year to him and 60 pounds a year to the city, extraordinary taxes to be divided between the two. This marks the turning-point in the history of the Jews of Ratisbon, who were henceforth abandoned to their fate; religious intolerance and social prejudice threatened their very existence. The overall impoverishment of the city fueled tensions between 1475 and 1519, and ultimately culminated in the expulsion of the Jewish community. The anti- Semitic preachings of Peter Nigri lead to the confiscating of the Jews' property in 1476, and the community was then thrown into chaos by the Simon of Trent trail in Italy. The Jewish community of Trent, in a blood libel, was accused of murdering a Christian boy for ritual purposes. While being tortured, one of the accused Jews said something about the Jewish community of Ratisbon using the blood of Christian children in ritual to make Passover matzo. Word was sent to Ratisbon, and seventeen Jews were arrested. They remained imprisoned for four years, and were released only after repeated requests from Frederick III. Later, the Anabaptist Balthasar Hubmaier called for the expulsion of Jews from the city, turning their synagogue into a church, and accused them of usury. When Maximilian died, the opportunity was taken to expel the Jews from the city, 800 in all, in 1519. Afterwards, about 5,000 tombstones from the Jewish cemetery were raised and used as building material. The synagogue was also raised and a chapel was built on the site, which became a popular pilgrimage place.  Cemetery and synagogue  The first cemetery of the community of Ratisbon was situated on a hillock, still called the \\"Judenau\\". In 1210 the congregation bought from the monastery of St Emmeram a plot of ground, outside the present Peterthor, for a new cemetery, which was destroyed in the course of excavations made in the city in 1877. It served as a burial-ground for all the Jews of Upper and Lower Bavaria, and, in consequence of the catastrophe of February 21, 1519, mentioned above, more than 4,000 of its gravestones are said to have been either demolished or used in the building of churches. The synagogue that was destroyed was an edifice in Old Romanesque style, erected between 1210 and 1227 on the site of the former Jewish hospital, in the center of the ghetto, where the present Neue Pfarre stands. The ghetto was separated from the city itself by walls and closed by gates.

Shortly before the dispersion of the community Rabbi Jacob Margolioth, the father of the convert and anti-Jewish writer Antonius Margarita, was living at Ratisbon; he is referred to in the Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum as the Primus Judæorum Ratisbonensis. Finally, the learned Litte (Liwe) of Ratisbon may be mentioned, the author of the \\"Samuelbuch\\", which paraphrased the history of King David in the meter of the Nibelungenlied.  In modern times  1660–1900 In 1669 Jews were again permitted to reside in Ratisbon, but it was not until April 2, 1841 that the community was able to dedicate its new synagogue. Rabbi Isaac Alexander (born Ratisbon August 22, 1722) was probably the first rabbi to write in German. His successor appears to have been Rabbi Weil, who was succeeded by Sonnentheil and the teacher Dr. Schlenker. From 1860 to 1882 the rabbinate was occupied by Dr. Löwenmeyer of Sulzburg, who was followed in January, 1882, by Dr. Seligmann Meyer, the editor of the \\"Deutsche Israelitische Zeitung\\". The present (1905) total population of Ratisbon is 45,426, of whom about 600 are Jews. 1901–present  References  *  Jewish Encyclopedia Bibliography  * For earlier works on Ratisbon see C. G.

Nuzum started her newspaper career in the 1940s at the daily newspaper, The Grafton Sentinel. In 1946 she became editor at a young age of 20 years and served in that capacity for six years. It was 1953 when Nuzum arrived at The Inter-Mountain, also a daily newspaper produced in Elkins, West Virginia (Ogden Newspapers Inc.), where she later guided that paper as editor for 32 years.

Truman on October 16, 1949, at Grafton, West Virginia as he passed through town by train. She interviewed former President Truman again in 1962 at the Mountain State Forest Festival in Elkins, West Virginia.Former President Harry Truman Visits Campus During Forest Festival in 1962.www.dewv.edu/about/first_hundred. Her White House \\"Invitation Only\\" interview with President Jimmy Carter on December 1, 1978 is on record during an era when a small number of news representatives from various areas of the country were asked to visit the White House as part of his press program. She was one of a few females interviewing leaders during that era as the doors were opening to female journalists. That interview is recorded as part of The American Presidency Project.Wooley, J.T. and Peters, Gerhard, \\"Interview with the President Remarks Question-and-Answer Session with Editors and News Directors-12-1-1978\\", The American Presidency Project, University of California, Santa Barbara, California,1999-2009, 3-4.

I know you're cutting back on spending the next year, but the Appalachian Regional Commission Act has built roads in West Virginia, schools and hospitals. We feel that this is an investment, and it is very important to our people in 13 states.

Nuzum was the first female to be an Editor-in-Chief of a regularly published daily newspaper in the state, as written by J. Richard Torren in the early 1970s.Morgan, French, \\"Yesterday's of Buchannon and Upshur\\", Republican-Delta, 1963. In 1965-67, Nuzum was elected President of United Press International (UPI) Editors of West Virginia. At that time, she was Editor of The Inter- Mountain and the only female editor in the state association. \\"The group representing 23 daily newspapers (in West Virginia) went on record as strongly opposed to secrecy in government and in favor of \\"open meetings\\" of government boards, commissions, and other agencies.\\"\\"Eldora M.

Through the years, Nuzum was very involved with the Associated Press (AP) also, as her newspaper and several other publications in West Virginia affiliated with AP, one of the major media forces in the United States and internationally. Nuzum gained national notice in 1974, when The Inter-Mountain facilities burned to the ground and she promised not to miss an edition. The story, reported nationally and carried in The Miami Herald, said that the building and equipment were gone except for one camera with no film. The staff had escaped with only their lives. However, the newspaper was still alive and the next day's edition would be published.\\"Newspaper Building Destroyed-Editor Laments $500,000 Loss\\", The Miami Herald, Miami, Florida, August 8, 1974, 8-B. She kept her promise and with support of the Ogden newspaper chain and loyal employees, a temporary newsroom was established and the paper was printed for a short time in a neighboring town. Not one employee lost their job or paycheck, and the promise was kept as subscribers received a newspaper the very next day on schedule. Paul Harvey, the famous radio personality, featured a story about \\"The Newspaper that Did Not Die in the Fire\\" to praise perseverance, creativity, and dedication in his \\"Rest of the Story\\" commentaries. One of Nuzum's often repeated statements was \\"this is what we have created today\\" as the staff admired daily editions.  Recognition  Nuzum was inducted posthumously into the West Virginia Press Association Hall of Fame in August 2009.

Kerr’s clinical research into adjuvant therapy of early stage colorectal cancer has contributed to saving thousands of lives over the past two decades.Lancet, 370(9604):2020-9. 2007; The Lancet, 355, 1588–96 (2000) Early life and education Kerr was born in Glasgow in 1956. He attended Dunard Street Primary School, Maryhill and Eastwood High Secondary School. Knowing from a relatively early age that he wanted to become a doctor having read A. J. Cronin's The Citadel as a child, he went on to study biochemistry and medicine at Glasgow University, and subsequently became an oncologic clinician scientist following specialist & fellowship training within the Department of Medical Oncology at the University of Glasgow under Professor S. Kaye (1984–1992). Career From March 1992, Kerr was Professor of Clinical Oncology at University of Birmingham and Director of Clinical Trials Unit where he and Professor Alan Rickinson built the Institute of Cancer Studies at the University. In 1994, he became the Clinical Director of the Regional Cancer Task Force for the West Midlands where he developed the model for cancer services in the region which involve in writing a Cancer Plan – The \\"hub and spoke\\" Network model was developed to include four key elements: *Site specialisation by cancer surgeons and oncologists *Multidisciplinary working *Development of regional treatment guidelines (often precursor of national guidelines) *Use of IT as a social glue to bind the Network together. He undertook the first national audit of cancer waiting times for Sir Kenneth Calman, who was then Chief Medical Officer which was one of the drivers which led to the Government creating a National Cancer Plan.British Medical Journal 320, 838–839. In 2001, he was appointed Rhodes Professor of Clinical pharmacology and Cancer Therapeutics and Head of the Department of Clinical Pharmacology at the University of Oxford. At the same time he was also asked by the Secretary of State for Health Alan Milburn to undertake a review of NHS research strategy into cancer. The resultant blueprint for provision of infrastructure to support clinical cancer research in the UK led to the establishment of the NHS Cancer Research Network (NCRN) and the National Translational Cancer Research Network (NTRAC). Kerr was subsequently appointed the Director of NTRAC. He subsequently worked with colleagues to build an Institute of Cancer Medicine and Cancer Treatment Centre in Oxford. In 2004, Kerr was invited by Scotland’s First Minister to chair the work of a National Framework Advisory Group to consider the future shape of the NHS in Scotland. This Group produced three volumes of work, \\"Building a Health Service Fit for the Future\\" (Vol I and II) and a web-based data link showing the Reports from the individual action teams.framework This has been adopted as the blueprint for Scotland’s NHS over the next 20 years. In 2009, David Kerr took a leave of absence from Oxford University to become the Chief Research Advisor at the Sidra Medical and Research Center. In April 2009, he became a Member of the Supreme Council of Health. He is no longer working for Sidra having moved back to the UK Kerr has made a substantial contribution to cancer care and research in Europe. He co-chaired the Anglo- French Scientific committee celebrating the centenary of the Entente-Cordiale (2004) after the Queen and President Chirac nominated cancer research as their joint theme. He has established the first Network of India's top cancer centres, turning it into an internationally recognised trials network and has trained many young Indian oncologists. He has brought worldwide attention to the looming epidemic of cancer which will claim the lives of more than a million Africans every year. He organised the first ever African Cancer Reform convention in London (2007). This was attended by 27 African Health ministries, led to the London Declaration calling for immediate action to develop cancer control plans for these nations. Subsequently Kerr was asked by African ministers to lead a new organisation, AfrOx to aid national cancer planning in Africa. AfrOx has already received unprecedented international support (WHO, IAEA) and is seen as a beacon to establish cancer care in Africa. He has completed a National Cancer Plan for Ghana, has been invited by the governments of Rwanda, Nigeria and Sierra Leone to lead their cancer plan activities, has initiated a mass vaccination programme for cervical cancer, the commonest cancer affecting African women, and is co-ordinating the International Oncology Association's engagement in this field. Kerr spoke at the New Frontiers in Science Diplomacy event and blogged on the Guardian about it. Published works Kerr has published over 350 papers in peer reviewed journals. His primary areas of research are: Colorectal Cancer and Gene therapy. He has been awarded several patents which have fuelled in spin out biotech companies – Cobra Therapeutics, Oxford Cancer Biomarkers, and Celleron Therapeutics.

The SWHAP concept is based on close co- operation between the company management, the local trade union branches and workers' representatives. The programme contributes to the establishment and support to HIV and AIDS programmes at Swedish companies and their partners in Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2010, SWHAP supported close to 90 workplaces directly and reached out to 20,000 employees, yet benefiting far more if taking into account the families and surrounding communities. The programme presently operates in Botswana, Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. SWHAP is financed by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, Sida. The workplace as arena for HIV/Aids programmes With an estimated 33 million people infected,Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), 2008 Report on the global AIDS epidemic the HIV and AIDS pandemic has severe humanitarian consequences as well as enormous effects on households, businesses and societies at large. HIV and AIDS is a workplace issue because it affects workers and their families, enterprises and communities which depend on them. For that reason, the workplace is one arena (out of many) to address the causes and implications of HIV and AIDS. The workplace has a vital role to play in the wider struggle to control the pandemic. Workplace programmes support prevention, expand access to care and ARV treatment, and promote non-discrimination. Globally, the International Labour Organization (ILO) has created Code of Practice on HIV/AIDS and the World of Work, a document that provides practical guidelines for HIV and Aids programmes at enterprise, community, and national levels. SWHAP is one of several initiatives that have been taken to address HIV and AIDS at the workplace level. In particular in Sub-Saharan Africa but also in other countries both employers' federations, trade unions, specialised business coalitions on HIV/AIDS and NGOs have increasingly addressed the issue For further information, see for example: World Economic Forum Global Health Initiative, Business & HIV/AIDS: A healthier partnership? (2006), , Programme objectives The overall development goal of SWHAP is for employers and employees at Swedish related workplaces in the Sub-Saharan region to have created effective HIV and AIDS programmes that contribute to the development of a wider private sector response. In order to achieve this, the programme has three primary objectives: • Workplace Programmes have been initiated and improved in an expanded number of companies. • Extensive experiences from SWHAP workplace programmes and from a broadening network of shared practice have been documented and used by other actors. • SWHAP has influenced the global HIV and AIDS Workplace arena by sharing experience and information in a variety of contexts. More specific goals include that management and employees should be stimulated to work hand in hand in the fight against HIV and AIDS, that already existing workplace programmes should be supported with fresh resources and that individual companies should be stimulated to increase similar HIV and AIDS activities. The programme also aims at developing an effective network between the participating workplaces.

Among various preparation methods, the ‘‘hot-water” method offers a simple procedure to prepare DODAB cationic vesicles by simply dissolving the DODAB in hot water above 50 °C, i.e., chain melting (main) transition, Tm. In general, the DSC thermograms of the unsonicated DODAB dispersions are dominated by two endotherms; the pre- (35–36 °C) and main transition (42.7–45 °C) peaks. Moreover, in literature reported the presence of a third endotherm (post transition) at 52.2 °C. The main transition (Tm) is ascribed to gel to liquid-crystalline phase transition in which the alkyl chains transform from solidlike to liquid-like state. The 10 mM DODAB is a critical concentration, below which the dispersions consist of large polydispersed unilamellar vesicles (ULVs) that exhibit a local (chain melting) transition at 43 °C, beyond which a structural transition occurs: ULVs --> MLVs (multilamellar vesicles) as indicated by the sudden increase in the dynamic moduli. However, above 10 mM DODAB, the dispersions are mostly formed by ULVs in coexistence with lamellar fragments resulting in a network that shows a rheogram similar to that of hexagonal liquid-crystalline phase.Coppola L. , Youssry M. , Nicotera I. , Gentile L. , \\" Rheological investigation of thermal transitions in vesicular dispersion\\".

Walker & Joanne M. Sharpe (Cambridge University Press, 2010)  Features  Platycerium superbum is a bracket epiphyte naturally occurring in and near rainforests but is now also widely cultivated as an ornamental plant for gardens. In both naturally occurring and propagated forms, these ferns develop a humus-collecting \\"nest\\" of non-fertile fronds and in doing so can grow up to 1 metre wide. The ferns also develop hanging fertile fronds that can reach up to 2 metres long. Both fertile and non-fertile fronds are broad and branching and grown to resemble the horns of a stag or elk, thus the common names stag horn or elk horn.  Nutrition  In the wild, the nest structure captures falling leaves and other detritus which then decomposes to provide the plant with nutrients. The ferns are known to favour a slightly acidic environment and so to encourage growth in propagated plants, some growers recommend adding used tea leaves directly to the plant's \\"nest\\". Others recommend doing the same with banana peel.Pat Welsh's Southern California Organic Gardening (3rd Edition): Month by Month by Pat Welsh (Chronicle Books, 2009)  References  superbum Category:Epiphytes Category:Ferns of Australia Category:Flora of New South Wales Category:Flora of Queensland Category:Paleotropical flora Category:Garden plants of Australia Category:House plants ","title":"Platycerium superbum"},{"id":"24208132","text":"Halali may refer to: * the Halali River in India * A Swahili word originating from the Arabic word halal, meaning lawful, legal, etc. * Halali, Mashhad, a village in Mashhad County, Razavi Khorasan Province, Iran * Halali-ye Mansur, a village in Bushehr Province, Iran * a rest camp in Etosha National Park in Namibia * , Rosa cultivar Halali also stands for: * (German) the ritual end of a hunt by horse * (German) the signal blown on the horn marking the end of a hunt by horse Halali is the surname of the following persons: * Esmail Halali, Iranian football player See also * Helali (disambiguation) ","title":"Halali"},{"id":"24208168","text":"Roberto Caruso (born 23 May 1967 in Sannicandro di Bari, Bari Province, in the region of Apulia) was an Italian road racing cyclist.

At the 2010 general election, Righton was the Conservative candidate for the new St Austell and Newquay constituency but lost to the Liberal Democrats. Biography Born Caroline Donovan in Bristol, Righton worked in several restaurants and hotels when she was a teenager; however, she had always intended to become a journalist. She worked as a Junior reporter for The West Briton and the Cornish Guardian. Also during this time, Caroline was presenting regional TV programmes for BBC South West in Plymouth. This work enabled her to gain vital experience, and she became one of the founding presenters of BBC Radio Cornwall in 1984. After presenting the Duchy Today programme with Ted Gundry, Righton became a producer of Radio Cornwall. Media career Righton transferred her skills as a radio presenter to television. She moved to Windsor, Berkshire and started presenting the BBC London regional early morning television show London Plus from 1985 to 1987. In 1987, Righton moved to the already successful ITV breakfast station, TV-am, becoming a national television presenter for the first time, she presented the early part of TV-am before handing over to the main Good Morning Britain show. The on-air promotions at the time said that she was recruited \\"to get the early rising men tuning in to TV-am's first hour\\". She joined in April 1987 and left in October the same year. Also at this time, she conducted a series of interviews with heavyweight boxers Frank Bruno and Joe Bugner during the build up to their fight at White Hart Lane in London. These interviews formed the basis of a Video Cassette release (later rereleased on DVD) called Frank Bruno v Joe Bugner: The Final Word. Righton occasionally wrote columns for The Times and The Guardian while she was presenting on TV-am. After leaving TV-am she occasionally appeared as a stand-in presenter on other news and Breakfast TV programmes reading the short BBC Daytime bulletins and BBC Breakfast Time bulletins in 1988. Next was BSB, Sky News, ITN and the occasional filling-in on LWT News in 1990. She occasionally presented on The Channel Four Daily, where she was presenter for the last edition of the failed show in 1992. During her time presenting the national news, Caroline presented on-screen with Jeremy Paxman and was a main anchor during the Gulf War. In the '90s, Caroline was the face of Channel Four's Daily Business News. Righton has produced television programmes for Sky, ITV and Channel 4. She then started her own producing business, before being bought out by a larger company and becoming the managing director of their broadcast division. During this time she worked closely with the companies corporate clients and had media coached senior personnel of many blue-chip companies. In 1999, after 14 years away, Righton returned to the West Country after becoming a regional controller for ITV company Carlton under her former TV-am boss Clive Jones. It was from her base in Cornwall in 2003, that Righton started her career as an author, with her first work, The Life Audit, a self-help plan and guide that has become a best-seller in America, Asia and Australia. It has also been translated into Mandarin Chinese, French and Dutch. Righton appeared on national television in the UK and on CBS's Early Show in the United States, while the associated website to the book has members from 25 different countries. Politician In January 2006, Righton put herself forward to the Conservative Party as a prospective Member of Parliament. Placed on the party's A-List of female and ethnic minority applicants, it was announced in 2008 that Righton would become the Conservative Parliamentary Candidate for the newly created seat of St Austell and Newquay. As this was a new seat there was no incumbent MP, however, the seat was regarded as having a notional majority of 5,723 (12.44%) to the Liberal Democrats. In the election, Righton came second to Liberal Democrat Steve Gilbert, despite reducing the majority to 1,312 (2.8%). Criticism In October 2009, she was subject to sustained and serious criticism after falsely accusing one of her opponents of publicly insulting her.http://www.libdemvoice.org/tories-st-austell-newquay-candidate-in- smearstupidity-storm-16651.html Righton had sent to a residents' association a tweet from her Liberal Democrat opponent pointing out that she had gone to a media event instead of the association's meeting. The tweet, however, had been modified to add an insult, and Righton wrongly claimed that she was unable to verify the contents of the original.http://andrewrunning.blogspot.com/2009/10/tories-in-dirty-campaign- tricks-shame.html Personal life Righton went to school at La Retraite High School in Clifton, Bristol, and then graduated from the University of Warwick with a degree in English. During a gap year Righton did a journalism course in Cardiff and after doing some work experience in Falmouth, Cornwall for Packet Newspapers, was offered a full-time job at the newspaper. Righton moved to Cornwall when she was 19, moving to Windsor when she was 27 and back to the West Country when she was 41. Righton married her husband, Mark, in 1979 and they have two sons. The family currently live in St Columb Major, Cornwall. Righton is a surfer and is a campaigner for the Surf Life Saving Association.

Its main campus is on Mudford Road, Yeovil, but the college also operates the North Dorset Skills Centre in Shaftesbury and the Construction Skills Centre, Lufton, Yeovil, not far from the Yeovil Town Football Club stadium. In conjunction with the universities of Bournemouth, the West of England (UWE) and Gloucestershire, the college also provides Higher Education, degree-level and professional courses at the University Centre Yeovil (UCY) on Preston Road, Yeovil. History Preceding the current establishment was a Science and Arts college of which was first founded in 1887 by appointment of Somerset County Council. In 1947 the college re- branded, with the help of their first principal, as 'Yeovil Technical College', before finally, in September 1974, becoming the location of an early experimental Tertiary College, only the third such in the United Kingdom.http://www.yeovil.ac.uk/aboutyc.htm The experiment was an attempt to see if it was possible to bring A-level and vocational education under one roof. The current college was constituted from the existing Yeovil Technical College, and the sixth forms of Yeovil School (boys) and Yeovil High School (girls). Two existing sites were used: the old Tech College site (between Ilchester and Mudford Roads) became the main facility, while the nearby Yeovil School site (on Mudford Rd/Goldcroft) became an annexe containing the Science Department, and Business and Secretarial Schools. The subsequent new building eventually enabled the former college site to be vacated and sold for housing development. Teaching is now concentrated on the site of the former Tech College. The teaching staff of the new college were also mainly retained from the previous Tech College, while almost the entire science department transferred from Yeovil School, giving the new college an excellent tradition in Science Education. Among other achievements, in its early years (1977 & 1981) the Chemistry Department twice won the annual \\"BBC Young Scientist of the Year\\" competition. Deemed successful, the results of the experiment has given rise to the college in its present form as well as allowing room for expansion, notably with the introduction of Degree level study at the University Centre Yeovil.http://www.yeovil.ac.uk/higher_education Leonardo Building The Leonardo Building opened in September 2007 and is a 5.7 million pound development featuring new equipment and dedicated facilities for Design, Art, Engineering, Photography and Media Students. It was officially opened by David Laws MP in November 2007. Other Facilities The college also has a beauty salon, Inner Beauty, two hairdressing salons (one in Yeovil, the Hair Zone, the other at the North Dorset Skills Centre, Headstart) and a restaurant, the Da Vinci. All are working, commercial ventures run by students and supervised by staff, and open to the public. Results In 2010, A-Level results for students studying a full-time programme of at least three A-Levels achieved a 99.1% pass rate, from 95% in 2009 and 100% in 2008. However, results in traditionally difficult subjects including Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Maths and Further Maths have remained high and many of the college's recent top results have been in these areas. In 2010, the full-time vocational pass rate was 95%, down from 97% in the previous year. Events There are a number of key events in the College calendar. These include the annual production every February, the Further Education Awards every December, the Arts and Fashion Show in June and Festival Fortnight, featuring departmental awards ceremonies, at the end of the summer term. Further education Yeovil College provides education for 16+ students after they leave secondary school, these courses include A-levels, GCSEs, BTEC Diplomas and the 14-19 Diplomas. The college also offers a variety of part-time courses and apprenticeships, as well as business training. Yeovil College also offers the Extended Project Qualification and AQA Baccalaureate to particularly able students as part of its Gifted and Talented programme. Higher education Yeovil College operates the University Centre Yeovil (UCY) in partnership with Bournemouth University, the University of the West of England and the University of Gloucestershire. Degree courses are validated by these partner institutions. Qualifications provided include Foundation and Honours degrees, Higher National Diplomas/Certificates, teaching qualifications and professional qualifications. The latter include Chartered Institute of Marketing, the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply and Institute of Legal Executives. Additionally, the centre offers its own access course and another from the Open College Network. The UCY has nursing students and offers a number of unique courses found nowhere else in the country, including a degree in Sustainable Graphics and Packaging and Garden History and Heritage Horticulture. The UCY holds a graduation ceremony every October. Structure Following an internal restructuring in 2008, the college is now separated into the following departments of Faculties, each managed by a Faculty Director: Arts, Media and Publishing, Health, Care and Teacher Training, Business and Hospitality, Engineering and Construction, Sport, Hair, Beauty and Complementary Therapies and Preparation for Life and Work. Further restructuring in 2014 has divided the curriculum into 12 \\"Areas\\" each have a centre area manager or CAM, the 12 are, Creative and Design Industries, Engineering, Construction, Motor vehicle, Hospitality, A-Levels, IT, Hair and Beauty Health, social care, Sport, Prep for working life, Business studies. Sport The College nurtures sporting talent and students are selected to play at regional, national and international levels. The College participates in the Talented Athlete Scholarship Scheme (TASS) run by the Department for Culture Media and Sport. It also has a number of academies for sports including men's and women's rugby, badminton, football, athletics and cross country, although it has been known to support more specialist sports persons in other areas, such as martial arts. The college is also Inclusive Fitness Initiative accredited Fitness Centre and has recently gained Premier status for Badminton. Men's football has been particularly successful in the last 5 years, with Yeovil College 1st team finishing Runner-up in the 2006/2007 National College Cup Final. Student Union The college has a student union, known as YCSU (Yeovil College Student Union). YCSU organises different events throughout the year from parties and shopping trips to a freshers' fair. Every Yeovil College student is automatically a member. The YCSU is also heavily involved in raising money for local and national charities.

Along the way, they learn about ancient civilization and also attempt to foil the plans of looters who steal the artifacts from the ancient sites. This series is a sequel to The Voyage of the Mimi, produced in 1984, in which the Granvilles rented their boat and services to zoologists studying the humpback whale in the waters off Massachusetts. The series aired on PBS and was created by the Bank Street College of Education in 1988 to teach middle-schoolers about science and social studies. In each episode, viewers are taught something scientific relating to plot events in the previous episode of the show. For example, an episode's plot would be about deciphering Mayan writing, and the viewer also receives information about how the Maya wrote various words and numbers. Cast The Second Voyage of the Mimi saw a young Ben Affleck return as C.T. Granville, and Peter G. Marston as his grandfather Captain Granville. Marston was a scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the production of the program and used to own the actual ship, the Mimi. Main Cast Listing: *Ben Affleck as Clement Tyler (C.T.) Granville *Peter G. Marston as Captain Clement Tyler Granville *Martha Hill as Pepper Thornton, who is an expert scuba diver *Roger Cudney as Pepper's former employer, Harvey Westerman. *Hector Tellez as Pedro, an employee of Westerman's. *Inaki Carrion as Victor Cobos, an archeologist *Cheryl Lynn Bruce as Terry Gibbs, another archeologist who works with Victor. *Carla Douglin as Quiché Gibbs, Terry Gibbs's daughter. *Enrique Lucero as Tomás Segovia, the man in charge of archeological sites in that part of Mexico. *Patricia Ancira as Rosa Segovia, Tomas Segovia's daughter, also a skilled diver. Episodes Each episode consists of two fifteen-minute segments. The first segment of each episode follows the serialized tale of scientists studying the ancient Maya and getting involved with thwarting site looters. The two scientists are Victor Cobos, a Mexican man of Maya descent, and Terry Gibbs, an American woman. Terry's husband is revealed to have been killed by site looters. Terry's daughter Quiché has grown up with archeology and can already read Maya writing. They hire the Granvilles in Quintana Roo, Mexico, near Tulum, to help them study the routes of ancient Maya ships. The Granvilles in turn hire Pepper Thornton, the daughter of one of Captain Granville's old sailing buddies, because she is an expert diver. Previously, Pepper worked for Harvey Westerman, a skinflint tour operator, guiding tourists on dives through then reefs. Each second segment is a standalone exploration of one of the scientific principles touched on in the serialized tale. In these second segments, one of the child actors (Ben Affleck or Carla Douglin) comes out of character and interviews real, in many cases well-known, scientists abouts their work. These scientists include archeologists Bill Fash, Peter Reynolds and David Stuart, and rain forest ecologist Nalini Nadkarni. In addition, Martha Hill, a silver medalist in the Winter Paralympics, comes out of character in an interview with Ben Affleck.

It was purchased in the early 1980s by Peter Marston and was kept moored in Gloucester, Massachusetts. Besides its appearances on the TV show, it went from city to city and acted as a tourist attraction in places such as Salem, Massachusetts, Boston, and other cities. In 1988, Peter Marston and some freelance musicians produced a cassette and songbook called \\"Sea Songs from the Mimi Crew\\" of old-time sea songs self-published under the name \\"The Barn School\\" based in Gloucester, Massachusetts. The cassette and songbook were available from the actual sailing vessel Mimi, as well as where music was sold, and in museum gift shops. The cassette and songbook are now out of print. Also available from the sailing vessel Mimi were souvenirs such as T-shirts and buttons that said \\"I was on board the Mimi.\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/167105448@N03/45601200465/in/album-72157674983785267/ The souvenirs are no longer manufactured, and have hardly turned up on Internet marketers such as eBay or Amazon. Marston retained ownership of the vessel until 1999, when the boat was sold to new owners; Captain George G. Story of Gloucester, Massachusetts, his brother Captain Alan M. Story of Deltona, Florida and Spiro \\"Steve\\" Cocotas, also from Gloucester. They operated the vessel as Three Mates Inc. for several years, bringing the boat to as many as 28 cities along the east coast. The Mimi eventually fell into disrepair, and was scrapped in 2011.

He was born in Karlsruhe, Germany in 1947 as the son of an electrical engineer. Zingraff showed an early interest in the arts, in particular in trompe-l'œil, the optical illusion technique. In Spain In 1972 he moved to Dénia, Spain, creating a number of critically noticed works in the surrealist style. He continued to paint purely abstract including architectural still lives in mixed media collage. In 1984 he started experimenting on wood strip images, while conversely, seemingly glued pieces of photography were actually painted. The 1980s In the years 1983 to 1985 Zingraff managed a crucial step in the current local art scene. As an absolute novice, in 1983 one of his pictures was selected by the jury of the 50th Salon de Otoño (Association of Spanish Painters and Sculptors) in Madrid. After a period of soft lines and shapes, he returned to the hard line.Yearbook of Spanish Art (Anuario de Arte Espanol), Lápiz, Madrid, 1983 Zingraff's Constructivism From 1996, Zingraff themed the removal of spatial continuity and visual ambiguity radically abstract. In 1999 he developed his personal style. He brought his compositions now effectively out of the area and out of the traditional format.

The former HQ and the surrounding land came under acquisition of the University of Dayton at a purchase price of $18 million. Downtown Dayton has also seen numerous residential developments, most notably in the Water Street District announced in mid-2013. Transportation projects in Downtown Dayton have also been on the rise. The Ohio Department of Transportation is currently in the process of $533 million of construction to modify and reconstruct I-75 through downtown Dayton. ODOT is upgrading and widening I-75 from Edwin C Moses Blvd. to Stanley Avenue. Many downtown bridges are also being upgraded. In 2010, the Greater Downtown Dayton Plan was announced. The Plan represents a vision for Dayton’s center city that focuses on strengthening connections and creating a downtown attractive to investors, businesses, employees, residents, students and visitors. This vision focuses on the potential of Greater Downtown to become an authentic urban center and the catalyst for Dayton's regional economy. The plan focuses on housing opportunities, and creating an inviting environment for businesses to relocate and stay in the downtown area. The plan will also home in on what makes downtown Dayton unique and build on it. This includes downtown arts, sports, health care, and entertainment. Face-lifts and improvements such as gateway projects, repaving, and upgrading building facades are also part of the plan.

He was hailed in later life as the 'Benjamin Franklin' of American labor.  Life  John Bray was born in Oregon Country (in what is today the US state of Washington) to parents who were in show business. His father had been born into a Yorkshire family of farmers and clothiers around Huddersfield. In 1822 they moved back to the West Riding, to Leeds. But their initial plans were stymied when his father died shortly after their return. Young John was then lodged with a relative and was apprenticed into the printing trade around the West Riding. He moved back to Leeds in 1832 and worked on a local paper and became involved in the working class movement in Leeds, including the Chartist Movement, then growing in Leeds around Feargus O'Connor's Northern Star. He also helped to found the Leeds Working Men's Association in 1837 and became its first treasurer. He delivered a number of lectures to the membership from which his first pamphlet Labour's Wrongs and Labour's RemedyLabour's Wrongs and Labour's Remedy (Leeds, David Green, Briggate, 1839) was drawn. Following the repression of the first wave of the Chartist Movement in the wake of the abortive uprising attempts of 1839 and the economic depression of 1841 - 1842, Bray returned to the US in 1842 and became a printer in Detroit. He later moved to Pontiac, Michigan where he began a family and later moved from printing into farming on a nearby farm. During the 1850s and 1860s he was active in the Democratic and working class movement locally and throughout the midwest. He wrote articles and lectured around the midwest opposing a range of social ills from Spiritualism to the Civil War and slavery. He supported the Socialist Labor Party and joined the Knights of Labor. As an old man he helped to shape the politics of the Populist Party of the 1890s.  Ideas and influence  Bray's pamphlet Labour's Wrongs and Labour's Remedy is quoted at length by Karl Marx in his 1847 attack on Proudhon, The Poverty of Philosophy. In it Marx uses him to show the unoriginality of Proudhon's mutualist proposals. Indeed, Bray's economics are those that have somewhat controversially (see Noel Thompson reference) been ascribed to the Ricardian socialists. In short a belief that the source of employers profits is an unequal exchange with employees in which the latter is not paid the full value of their labour. The remedy then is based on creating a society of equal exchange between producers at fair value. Bray's ideas in this sense are in the tradition of market socialism. According to French Socialist Paul Lafargue, who calls \\"Labour's Wrongs, and Labour's Remedy\\" \\"his remarkable work\\", Bray had called for the establishing of \\"equitable labour exchanges\\", not \\"as a solution of the social problem\\" but \\"only [as] a means of smoothing over the transition from the capitalist to the communist régime\\". Several were started in 1840 -- \\"in London, Sheffield, Leeds and other towns\\", but \\"after absorbing vast capital, had gone bankrupt under scandalous circumstances.\\"http://www.marxists.org/archive/lafargue/1897/09/socialism- france.htm  Bibliography  * Bray, John Francis, Labour's wrongs and labour's remedy, Leeds, England (1839). * Bray, John Francis, Government and society considered in relation to first principles, (1842) * Bray, John Francis, A Voyage from Utopia to Several Unknown Regions of the World, (written 1842; published posthumously) * Bray, John Francis, The coming age devoted to the fraternisation and advancement of mankind through religious, political and social reforms.

Mutagenesis and mass spectrometry identified the alternative initiation codon as the start codon for the novel 56-kDa protein and its location was mapped to a region located upstream of the AUG initiation codon.

Mutations that disrupted these stem-loop structures showed that SL1 and SL2 as required for translation initiation from the GGC codon but SL3 has no effect on translation efficiency.

It grows on trees or on rocks, with wiry, prostrate stems, prostrate, fleshy leaves and spikes of up to twenty white to cream-coloured flowers in early spring. Description Dendrobium linguiforme is an epiphytic or lithophytic orchid with prostrate stems that produce wiry roots along almost their whole length. The roots are long and in diameter. There is a single leaf at the end of each branch of the stem. The leaf is oblong to egg-shaped, long and wide. It is thick and succulent with the upper surface smooth but with ridges and furrows. Up to twenty flowers are arranged in a raceme long. The dorsal sepal is linear to narrow lance-shaped, long and wide, the lateral sepals are long and wide, the petals slightly smaller. The petals and sepals are white to cream-coloured. The labellum is cream-coloured with pale purple markings and is long and wide. Flowering occurs in September and October. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described in 1800 by Swedish botanist Olof Swartz and the description was published in Kongliga Vetenskaps Academiens Nya Handlingar. In 1981, the German botanist, Friedrich Brieger transferred the species to Dockrillia as D. linguiformis but the change has not been accepted by the herbarium of the Royal Botanic Garden, Sydney and other sources. The specific epithet (linguiforme) is derived from the Latin words lingua meaning \\"tongue\\" and forma meaning \\"shape\\". Distribution and habitat Tongue orchid occurs in New South Wales and Queensland where it grows on rocks and trees, usually in sclerophyll forest and sometimes in rainforest or in rocky places. In New South Wales it occurs on the coast and tablelands north of Ulladulla and inland as far as Gungal and Tamworth. In Queensland it is found from the Atherton Tableland to Townsville and south from Gympie to the New South Wales border.

He was a prominent pro- Belgian in the Belgian Revolution, serving in the Belgian national legislature, before entering the Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg, of which he was the first President, from 1848 to 1853. Charles was born in Luxembourg City in 1799 to Jean Metz and Anne-Marie-Justine Gérard. He studied at the Athénée de Luxembourg and the lycée in Metz, France, before reading law at the newly established University of Liège, graduating in 1822.Mersch (1963), p. 429 Metz first became politically active as a pro-Belgian spokesperson during the Belgian Revolution. In the National Congress called in Brussels, Metz was one of sixteen deputies representing the arrondissement of Luxembourg (claimed in its entirety by Belgium).Mersch (1963), p. 430 In 1836, Metz moved to Arlon, where he established a newspaper, L'Echo de Luxembourg, to promote Luxembourgian and liberal interests, along with Emmanuel Servais and Victor Tesch.Mersch (1963), p. 373 In 1837, Metz was elected to the Chamber of Representatives, representing Grevenmacher until 1841. He urged the Belgians to enter negotiations with the Netherlands, but spoke against the Third Partition of Luxembourg, ultimately voting against the Treaty of London.Mersch (1963), p. 432 In 1839, he stood for election to the Chamber of Representatives for Bastogne, but lost, remaining as representative of now- partitioned Grevenmacher. Metz, along with his younger brothers Auguste and Norbert, established the steel company Auguste Metz & Cie in 1838, but he played little active role in its operations. Metz was allowed to return to the (smaller) Grand Duchy of Luxembourg to practise law in 1842.Mersch (1963), p. 433 With the collapse of the Orangist Journal de la Ville et du Pays Luxembourg in 1844, Metz went about establishing the new Courrier de Luxembourg, along with his brother Norbert and other leading liberals, as well as the conservative Orangist Mathieu-Lambert Schrobilgen, with whom the ideological split became more and more apparent over time.Mersch (1963), p. 434 During 1848, Metz was elected to the Constituent Assembly, being elected to represent the cantons of Esch and Luxembourg, but opting to represent the latter. The Metz brothers narrowly failed to defer Luxembourg sending a delegation from Luxembourg to the Frankfurt Parliament,Mersch (1963), p. 436 although their position cost them their potential part in the three-man delegation.Mersch (1963), p. 436–7 The Metz brothers were elected to the inaugural Chamber of Deputies.

He was a staunch civil liberties activist in Andhra Pradesh. He had broken away from the Andhra Pradesh Civil Liberties Committee (APCLC), with which he was associated since its inception in ‘80's, on the issue of violence perpetrated by the erstwhile CPI-ML Peoples War. He was a writer on people's issues and had recently written about the developments on the Maoist front in west Bengal. Early life Balagopal was the fifth child of eight children of a middle class Telugu Brahmin couple- Kandalla Parthanatha Sarma and Rallapalli Nagamani. One of his brothers, Anantha, was a doctor in the Indian army. His father's job in the insurance sector entailed frequent transfers and Balagopal's education was in several towns of AP, from Nellore to Vizianagaram. After Pre-University education in Kavali and BSc in Tirupati, he took an MSc and PhD in Mathematics from the Regional Engineering College in Warangal before proceeding to Delhi for a post-doctoral at the Indian Statistical Institute. He returned to Warangal in 1981, where he started teaching Maths at the Kakatiya University. This was also the time when he decided on social activism and joined the Andhra Pradesh Civil Liberties Committee. Career Balagopal was a mathematician, he began his career as a teacher in Warangal but soon turned full-time human rights activist. He was a Mathematics professor at Kakatiya University before quitting in 1985. He did his Phd in Kakatiya University. He chose to become a lawyer much later, after getting fully associated with the human rights movement. Balagopal served as the general secretary of Andhra Pradesh Civil Liberties Committee (APCLC) between 1983 and 1997. Following differences of opinion within the APCLC on how to respond to revolutionary violence he left APCLC and formed the Human Rights Forum. Over a period of 26 years, he documented and took up cases of thousands of extrajudicial killings by government forces in Andhra Pradesh and elsewhere. During a series of kidnapping committed by the Maoists in the late 1980s, the vigilante organisation Praja Bandhu () abducted him and demanded that two police officers be released from naxalite custody. The organisation, which was suspected to have ties with the state police, released him only after the abducted policemen were returned. First introduced to Marxism through reading DD Kosambi, K. Balagopal followed a dialectical Marxist method in scores of articles published in the Economic and Political Weekly until the early 90s. Deeply disturbed by the collapse of the Soviet Union, Balagopal began to explore humanist traditions in Marxism for answers. His articles in the 90s reflect this shift. Human Rights Forum Balagopal founded the Human Rights Forum in Andhra Pradesh. His public criticism of the acts of violence by Maoists attracted severe criticism from the naxalites. Following his comments on the violence in Lalgarh in West Bengal, Maoist Central Committee member, Mallojula Koteshwar Rao had challenged Balagopal to visit Lalgarh resistance area to know the real picture. He served as a member of the Expert Group on Development Challenges in Extremist Affected Areas, set up by Planning Commission of India in 2008. He believed that human rights are indivisible. He was known for his simple living and his analytical articles that appeared regularly in Economic and Political Weekly.His articles in EPW included issues ranging from the regime of Indira Gandhi, Reservations issue, human rights violations from time to time in different places, the Gujarat riots, Special Economic Zones, land acquisition, sub-categorisation of Scheduled Castes in Andhra Pradesh, the failure of talks between the YSR Government and the CPI-Maoists and so on. His Telugu essay 'Cheekati Konaalu'directly questioned the violation of human rights by those who claimed that they were working for a radical revolution. After the formation of Human Rights Forum, he expanded his activities and visited areas undergoing intense social turmoil in Jammu and Kashmir, Gujarat, West Bengal and Orissa. In Orissa his fact-finding teams visited Rayagada district and documented the perspective of people displaced by Utkal Allumina Project, Jagatsinghpur district in respect of people affected by proposed Posco steel plant and Kandhamal district, which was affected by communal and ethnic clashes in 2007/2008. He analysed and exposed the hypocrisy in the functioning of most of the mainstream political parties. Balagopal started practicing law nearly a decade ago and has argued dozens of cases pertaining to encounter killings by the police. He died of cardiac arrest in Banjara Hills, Hyderabad on the night of 8 October 2009. Personal life Balagopal was married to Vasanta Lakshmi, a journalist currently working in Andhra Jyothy newspaper. They have a son, Rigobertha Prabhatha. Legacy Ramachandra Guha praised Balagopal for his non-partisan commitment to human rights.

Early life He attended Wellesley House School (1938–43), originally at Broadstairs, Kent, but from September 1939 was evacuated to the Scottish Highlands. At Eton College (1943–48) Stacey became a fourth-generation successive Stacey pupil at Eton, where he was a solo treble, the founder of Wotton's Society in the field of philosophy, editor (with Douglas Hurd) of the weekly Eton College Chronicle, winner of the Essay Prize, and House Captain. With the Scots Guards (1948–50), in which he received his commission as Second Lieutenant, on active service in what is now known as peninsular Malaysia, he spent his leave with the Temiar aborigines in the jungle, and wrote his first book (The Hostile Sun). At Worcester College, Oxford, England (1950–51), he founded and co-organised the controversial students' tour operation, Undergrad Tours, during the 1951 Festival of Britain year. Journalistic career He was staff writer at the Lilliput Magazine (1951–52), as a colleague of Patrick Campbell and Maurice Richardson. He then became feature writer and foreign correspondent for Picture Post (1952–54). During 1954 he became the Daily Express (London) 'Express Explorer' in which he crossed Africa overland from the Atlantic to East Africa, accompanied by Ugandan Cambridge university graduate Erisa Kironde, and lived with the Bakonzo people of the Ruwenzori Mountains. Briefly a roving correspondent for the Montreal Star (1955–56), he rejoined the Daily Express in 1956–60 as foreign correspondent and diplomatic correspondent, with a spell as daily America columnist in 1957. He joined The Sunday Times as roving correspondent and chief foreign correspondent (1960–65), with a worldwide brief, covering the dismantling of the British Empire globally, and major conflict zones of the period, and interviewing many heads of state (including Nikita Khrushchev, Morarji Desai, Ayub Khan, Harold Macmillan, and Éamon de Valera). He then moved to the London Evening Standard (1965–67), where he was a columnist and roving correspondent, while standing for Parliament. Subsequent freelance assignments were undertaken for The Times, The Sunday Telegraph, The Daily Telegraph, The Observer, Daily Mail, and The Spectator. In all, Stacey has reported from over 120 countries, many of them several times. Publishing career From 1967–70 he was editor and creator of Correspondents World Wide, a current affairs service for schools and universities, mobilizing the skills of several distinguished journalistic colleagues. From 1969–73 he was creator and joint managing director of general publishers Tom Stacey Ltd and subsidiaries (Tom Stacey Reprints, Tom Stacey Education Ltd), which published, inter alia, the Prospect for Man ecological series, and created the 20-volume Peoples of the Earth series, conceived by Stacey and released by Tom Stacey Ltd, Grolier (US) and Mondadori in 14 languages. In 1974, he founded Stacey International, the book publisher, originally majoring extensively on the Middle East and Islamic world, later expanding into general book publishing and initiating the literary fiction imprint Capuchin Classics, the Independent Minds series campaigning on heterodox climate science and the legalislation of all drugs; and the \\"return of real history\\" with the reissue of Carter & Mear's History of Britain for schools, in 9 volumes. Personal life, politics and penology In January 1952 he married Caroline Clay who was to become a widely exhibited sculptor, mostly in clay for bronze. They have five children (Emma, healer, born 1952; Tilly, potter, born 1954; Isabella, born 1957 (married to Christopher Simon Sykes, the photographer and biographer), who as an international stage and opera designer/director works as Isabella Bywater (being the name of her first husband, Michael Bywater); Sam, born 1966, a civil engineer and mountaineer; and Tomasina, obstetrician, born 1967. The couple live at Clementi House, Kensington Church Street, an early 18th-century house which became Felix Mendelssohn's base during his early sojourns in London. In October 1954, in Uganda, Stacey co-founded the Bakonzo Life History Research Society, which, throughout a tempestuous campaign demanding his consistent involvement, was to emerge as the vehicle of a recognised Kingdom of Rwenzururu 55 years later. He contested the parliamentary seat of Hammersmith North for the Conservatives in 1964, and was defeated; and of Dover in 1966, where, again defeated, he increased the Party vote against a landslide to Labour nationally. Re-adopted for Dover, he decided to quit active politics the following year to allow for his creative life. In 1968 he jointly led the first water-borne expedition descending the upper reaches of the Blue Nile from its source. In 1974 he became a prison visitor, following his own imprisonment (as a foreign correspondent) in India in 1965. He has continued in the role ever since. In 1981 he conceived the electronic tag for (appropriate) offenders, as an alternative to imprisonment, and in 1982 formed and launched the Offender's Tag Association as a pressure group for the adoption and exploitation of the tag (a term adopted by Stacey from the inception of the scheme). Offender tagging has subsequently become widely used in penological reform in Britain and throughout the world. Stacey remains Director of the OTA. In 1999 he conceived and organised 'Pilgrimage 2000', a nationwide Christian pilgrimage, starting at eight sacred sites and converging upon Canterbury to herald the new Millennium. In 2001 Stacey ascended to the Ruwenzori glaciers following the defeat of the ADF guerilla invaders from the Congo. His 500-page work Tribe, the Hidden History of the Mountain of the Moon (2003) proved to be of decisive influence in Uganda's recognition of the Kingdom of Rwenzururu as one of the five Kingdoms of the country's Bantu south. In 2009 Stacey was hailed by the approximately 800,000 people of the Ruwenzori Mountains as 'catalytic agent' in the recognition by the Government of Uganda of their ethno-cultural entity, Rwenzururu, with its King who is now in remand (28/11/2016) in Kampala for allegedly inciting violence, rebellion and calling for independence from Uganda, in clashes reported to leave over 50 people dead. Literary work Tom Stacey writes his literary work in response to the inner clamour of each work to be written. The flow of such work is consequently irregular. Stacey's novel Deadline was filmed to his own screenplay in 1989, starring John Hurt and Imogen Stubbs, but he has disowned the film in disgust at its editing. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1977. His awards include the John Llewellyn Rhys Memorial Prize, and the (Granada) Foreign Correspondent of the Year Award (1961). Various of his novels have been Book of the Year choices by critics of national journals, including Decline (Sunday Telegraph), Tribe (TLS), and The Man Who Knew Everything (New Statesman). Most of his fiction has been separately published in the US, and some in translation. Works-in-progress include two novels, and two further collections of long-short stories. Profiles of Stacey have been published in the Observer Magazine and elsewhere. His early fiction is assessed in Contemporary Novelists (St Martin's Press, New York, 1972).

History The Colégio Farroupilha was founded in 1886 by the Deutscher Hilfsverein, a beneficent association created to help the German-Brazilian immigrants and their descendants. The school's first name was Knabenschule des Deutschen Hilfsvereins. At that time, classes were taught in rooms rented from the evangelical community in downtown Porto Alegre, and only boys were accepted as pupils. In 1895, the first building of the school was inaugurated, located in the São Rafael Street (now Avenue). In this area, Plaza São Rafael is now installed, a Five-Star hotel. The Girls School begun operating officially in 1904. In 1911, the kindergarten was created, and it became the first in the state of Rio Grande do Sul and the third one in Brazil. In 1962, due to the growing number of students, the school was transferred to a new building, constructed on a land purchased by the beneficent association in 1928. The place was known as Chácara das Três Figueiras and the local neighborhood was named after it.

The battle was for control of the supply line Route 24. Background Due to insufficient strength in troop numbers, a gap of about between the US 1st Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment and the 23rd Regimental Combat Team. The PVA having become aware of the gap, prepared to exploit the gap in its offensive on Wongju. On 12 February 1st Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment manning positions upon Hill 444 east of Chip'yong-ni were attacked by two PVA battalions and was withdrawn to positions northwest of Wonju. During the morning of the 13 February, air observers noted PVA troop movements towards the gap toward the US 2nd Infantry Division's 2nd Reconnaissance Company east of Chuam-ni. The 2nd Reconnaissance Company having been sent out to patrol Route 24 in the gap in the defensive line around Wongju, were reinforced with L Company, 9th Infantry Regiment at 12:00 on 13 February. Almost immediately they were attacked by PVA from the northeast, which was repulsed. The PVA then tried to encircle the two companies bringing about the withdrawal of the companies to a blocking position on Route 24 at Chuam-ni. Battle On 14 February at 05:00, the PVA, consisting of a regiment of the 116th Division of the 39th Army, launched an attack against the 2nd Reconnaissance Company and L Company, 9th Infantry at Chuam-ni. Suffering large casualties, the two companies withdrew south along Route 24. Having been surrounded, the companies fought a fighting withdrawal suffering further casualties. The total casualties suffered by the 2nd Reconnaissance Company and L Company, 9th Infantry were 114 killed and 98 wounded. PVA casualties were also heavy. The result of the withdrawal was that the 23rd Regiment was cut off and the isolated Regiment would then fight the Battle of Chipyong-ni. The 27th British Commonwealth Brigade, consisting of the 1st Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, the 1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, the 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, the 60th Indian Field Ambulance, and the 16th Field Regiment, Royal New Zealand Artillery, were ordered to open Route 24 to the 23rd Regimental Combat Team and cover the gap in the defenses. Meeting the remnants of the 2nd Reconnaissance Company and L Company, 9th Infantry south of Chuam-ni and while pushing north slowly through PVA blocking the route. Moving slowly north along Route 24, the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade heading towards Chip'yong-ni, were initially held up by a battalion sized force on 15 February, however on 16 February, the PVA had withdrawn and Chuam-ni was occupied on 17 February. Aftermath With the PVA and North Korean forces withdrawing, a UN offensive was undertaken, known as Operation Killer. It was found that 68 soldiers of L Company had been killed by the PVA while sleeping and were found still in their sleeping bags.

The plot focuses on the notorious pirate Edward \\"Blackbeard\\" Teach, and his blockade of Charles Town in South Carolina in 1718. The musical portrays Blackbeard as a compassionate person, who's deeply in love with a woman on his ship named Mary Ormond. Blackbeard struggles to maintain his fierce façade, while at the same time trying to win the heart of the pacifistic Mary. Blackbeard debuted at the Herberger Theatre Center in Phoenix, Arizona, on September 5, 2008, under the direction of Cambrian James and the musical direction of Rob Gardner himself. Marketed as a 'pre-Broadway event', the musical received mixed to positive reviews from critics, and won 9 AriZoni Awards from 15 nominations. On May 1, 2009, Blackbeard made its Australian premiere in Bunbury, Western Australia. Background In an interview with Broadway World, Gardner said his inspiration for creating the musical was a documentary he saw on television about Blackbeard. Fascinated, he researched his life, and found that most of his apparent deeds were legend, rather than fact. He also found that Blackbeard had a notable fondness for women, marrying fourteen women, of whom he only married Mary legitimately. As Broadway World writes: \\"it was this multi-layered, paradoxical character that Gardner chose as the protagonist for his new musical\\". Blackbeard had a successful workshop run in the summer of 2007 in Phoenix, for which it was nominated for all its AriZoni awards. After the show was subsequently 'reworked and re-imagined', the show premiered globally on September 5 at Herberger Theatre Center in Phoenix, running until September 27. In November 2007, the director of the Bunbury production negotiated the rights for the Australian premiere of Blackbeard with Gardner. Blackbeard premiered in Bunbury on May 1, 2009, but only performed two shows. Characters *Edward 'Blackbeard' Teach: The notorious pirate who is more concerned about how he is perceived by his enemies and in legend than his deeds. *Mary Ormond: Blackbeard's love interest, she exhibits strong love for Blackbeard, but is conflicted by his sadistic, inhumane ways. *Lieutenant Robert Maynard: A lieutenant of the Royal Navy stationed in South Carolina, Maynard is humble, compassionate, and deeply in love with his fiancée Anne. *Anne: Robert Maynard's fiancée. Anne is taken hostage by Blackbeard, and opposes his attempts to scare her. *Stede Bonnet: A collaborator with Blackbeard who works as a piracy advisor for Governor Johnson. Bonnet is a fancy, overweight and camp character, who acts as comical relief in the musical. *Governor Robert Johnson: The governor of South Carolina, who authorizes the plans to deal with Blackbeard. He doesn't trust Maynard entirely due to his sincere affection for Anne. *Mr. Israel Hands: Blackbeard's second-in-command. Mr. Hands is superstitious and intimidated by Blackbeard, but also encourages him to be evil. *Georgette: The barmaid at a tavern near Charleston. Reception Blackbeard has received mixed reviews, tending towards the positive, with almost universal acclaim for the music score. Pasha Yamotahari of The Pashavian Review, a reviewer of Arizonian theatre, wrote that the musical lacked \\"clarity in its structure and goal\\", but praising the music score as \\"magical\\". Paula Shulak of theatermaven.com also held the music score in high acclaim, but stressed that Blackbeard's major flaw was its script and its thin plot. Showup.com, a website that collates amateur reviews and ratings of musicals, gave Blackbeard an average rating of 4.4 out of 5 stars. Factual inaccuracies The director's notes of the Bunbury production of Blackbeard state that \\"though not completely historically accurate, the main storyline is based on truth\\".Perks, Glen. Director's notes of the 'Blackbeard: A New Musical' programme. Bunbury Regional Entertainment Centre. 2009-05-01. Retrieved on 2009-05-06. Though all of the main characters are based on real people, bar Anne and Georgette, their fates differed considerably from their interpretations in the musical, or are completely unaccounted for. The characters' actual fates include: *Blackbeard: Blackbeard's blockade of Charleston Harbour is mostly accurate, however, Blackbeard did not die as a result of the blockade. He left Charleston Harbour, after receiving his ransom chest of medicine and releasing his hostages without their clothing and jewellery, and accepted a pardon from the North Carolina governor Charles Eden, who had previously conspired with Blackbeard to receive treasures in exchange for unofficial protection. Blackbeard returned to piracy shortly after his pardoning, attracting the attention of the Governor of Virginia, Alexander Spotswood. Spotswood mobilised 60 soldiers, under the command of Lt. Maynard. Blackbeard's crew of 20 fought Maynard's forces at Ocracoke, North Carolina. Blackbeard is reported to have suffered five bullet wounds and over twenty severe sword wounds before dying. Maynard decapitated his corpse and hung his head on the bowsprit of his ship. *Mary: Mary married Blackbeard at Bath, North Carolina, at least several months before his death. Mary was just 16 years old at the time, and the daughter of a wealthy plantation owner. It's been claimed that Blackbeard forced Mary to prostitute herself to the other crew members,The Republic of Pirates: Being the True and Surprising Story of the Caribbean Pirates and the Man Who Brought Them Down by Colin Woodard, 2007. and it is probable that she bore at least one child. Her ultimate fate is unknown. *Stede Bonnet: Bonnet indeed collaborated with Blackbeard, but a fortnight before Blackbeard's death, he faced charges of piracy, and was hanged, eighteen days after Blackbeard's death.Butler, Lindley S. Pirates, Privateers, and Rebel Raiders of the Carolina Coast, pp71–72. Chapel Hill, North Carolina: University of North Carolina Press, 2000. . *Israel Hands: Hands, according to Daniel Defoe's A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the most notorious Pyrates, is believed to have died a poor and homeless man in London. Awards Blackbeard's 2007 Phoenix workshop production garnered 15 AriZoni nominations with 9 wins, most notably 'Best Original Production for a Musical', 'Best Original Script for a Musical', and 'Best Original Music Composition'.

It was announced on 9 May 2016 that Coddington would be working with Tiffany & Co. Later that year Grace Coddington's new campaign for Tiffany & Co. A/W 16, featuring Elle Fanning launched. The campaign was sparse of product shots and traditional models. With direction from Coddington, Tiffany opted instead to feature celebrities and close up imagery of the jewelry styled on the body. The September Issue Coddington came into the public eye in 2009 with the release of The September Issue, a fly-on-the-wall documentary about the making of the September 2007 issue of Vogue.

Alem in Buenos Aires. Avenida Leandro N. Alem is one of the principal thoroughfares in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and a commercial nerve center of the city's San Nicolás and Retiro districts. Overview By way of a beautification effort, Viceroy Juan José de Vértiz y Salcedo had a two-lane street built along what was then the shores of the Río de la Plata. Marking the eastern end of the city, the thoroughfare was landscaped with cottonwood trees (alamos, in Spanish), and was thus inaugurated in 1780 as the Paseo de la Alameda. The paseo became a popular weekend promenade, and its contiguous shores an unofficial riverfront park popular with bathers until an 1809 edict banned the practice for reasons of \\"moral terpitude.\\"Clarín (5/25/2000) The frontage remained flood-prone, and in 1846, Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas had a contention wall six blocks long built along the paseo. Inaugurated in March 1848 as the Paseo Encarnación Ezcurra (in honor of his wife), Rosas had it renamed the Paseo de Julio that October in honor of the Ninth of July, date of the Argentine Declaration of Independence (the road's southern half was renamed Paseo Colón, in honor of Christopher Columbus, in 1857). An English Argentine investor, Edward Taylor, opened a pier along the promenade in 1855, and the flood-control walls were extended northwards to Recoleta, and south to San Telmo, in subsequent works completed in 1865.Buenos Aires.gov: Paseo de Julio The Paseo de Julio in 1867 The Paseo de Julio at the turn of the 20th century Immigration in Argentina afterwards made the Paseo a veritable bazaar, in which Italian trattorias, French bistrots, German beer halls, and Greek restaurants operated alongside brothels and seedy bars. The increasingly commercial desirability of the street, however, prompted the city to mandate in 1875 that all buildings along it be designed with porticos, a regulation still in force and one which forced the paseo's more precarious establishments to close.Walter, Richard J. Politics and Urban Growth in Buenos Aires, 1910-1942. Cambridge University Press, 1993. A sudden economic and population boom led the new President of Argentina, Julio Roca, to commission the development in 1881 of an ambitious port to supplement the recently developed facilities at La Boca, in Buenos Aires' southside. Approved by the Argentine Congress in 1882 and financed by the prominent London-based Barings Bank (the chief underwriter of Argentine bonds and investment, at the time), the project required the reclaiming of over 200 hectares (500 acres) of underwater land and was accompanied by the widening of the Paseo de Julio into a boulevard.Puerto Madero: history These improvements were capped by the installation of a decorative fountain on the median, for which an Argentine student of Auguste Rodin's, Lola Mora, was commissioned. Unveiled in 1903, the Font of the Nereids sparked moralist outrage over its nude Venus, and the masterpiece was relocated to its present Puerto Madero site in 1918. The Comega Building The improved boulevard saw the replacement of clapboard structures for upscale office buildings, mostly influenced by French architecture, and all distinguished by their archways. Among the most notable were the head offices of the Nicolás Mihanovich Shipping Company and Bunge y Born (then Argentina's leading grain exporter) and the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange's new headquarters (1916). The election that year of longtime universal male suffrage activist and UCR leader Hipólito Yrigoyen resulted in the boulevard's renaming in honor of Leandro Alem, the founder of the centrist UCR, in a November 1919 ordinance. The UCR government completed the avenue's best-known landmark, the Buenos Aires Central Post Office, in 1928, though a 1930 coup d'état resulted in the return of conservative rule. Changes in national politics did not rename or adversely impact the avenue, which was further widened and improved by Mayor José Guerrico in 1931, adding new medians to delimit bus and taxi lanes, and giving the boulevard its approximate current layout. The avenue's eclectic architectural selection was added to by rationalist buildings such as the Comega (1930) and the 42-story Alas (1950), which remained the tallest in Argentina until 1995. President Juan Perón, who had the Alas built, ordered the avenue's stretch north of Plaza San Martín renamed Avenida del Libertador in 1950, to commemorate the centennial of General José de San Martín's death (San Martín is known as the Liberator of Argentina and Perú). Zoning changes encted in 1966 allowed the development of the Catalinas Norte business park at the avenue's northern end, bringing with it the International style to the avenue's cityscape. Leandro Alem remains one of the city's most valuable commercial real estate addresses, and its last undeveloped lots, municipal property totalling no more than 15,000 m² (160,000 ft²) and estimated to be worth around US$80 million, were publicly proposed for sale in 2009.Clarín (8/11/2009) Points of Interest Avenida Leandro N.

Koldskål is made with buttermilk and other varying ingredients: eggs, sugar, cream and/or other dairy products, vanilla, and sometimes lemon. The dish arose when buttermilk became commonly available in Denmark in the early 1900s and was eaten chilled most days during the summer as a dessert or snack. Since 1979, there have been ready-made varieties on the Danish market, originally from Esbjerg Dairy, but now from a range of dairies, including Arla. Koldskål with biscuits The earliest mentions of koldskål are from the 18th century, where the term was used to describe a sweet beer-based gruel, however this dish is not commonly eaten any more. It was not until the 19th century that recipes for buttermilk- based koldskål appeared, and it took until the 20th century for the dish to become a mainstay in Danish homes. Traditionally, buttermilk koldskål is served with dry, crispy biscuits such as kammerjunker or tvebakker. Sometimes sliced strawberries are added. Like most activities in Denmark, the consumption of koldskål is highly dependent on the weather, and a couple of weeks of warm weather can double the demand for ready-made koldskål. In 2013, Arla sold 3.8 million litres of koldskål in the month of July alone (about 2/3 litres per Dane).

It concerns the armed conflicts of the Thracian tribes and their kingdoms in the Balkans. Apart from conflicts between Thracians and neighboring nations and tribes, numerous wars were recorded among Thracian tribes. Mythological Instances of Thracian people engaging in armed conflict occur in the Iliad of Homer and in Greek mythology. The Greek Temenids ousted the Thracians from Pieria (later central Macedonia).The Thracians 700 BC-AD 46 (Men-at-Arms) by Christopher Webber and Angus McBride, 2001, , page 4 The Thracians, prominent warriors who became allies of Troy, came from the Aegean coast.The Odrysian Kingdom of Thrace: Orpheus Unmasked (Oxford Monographs on Classical Archaeology) by Z. H. Archibald, 1998, , page 94 In the Odyssey there is only one instance of Thracians, that of Cicones again on the coast, but they are weak.The Odrysian Kingdom of Thrace: Orpheus Unmasked (Oxford Monographs on Classical Archaeology) by Z. H. Archibald, 1998, , page 93 The Thracians were a particularly fierce culture in terms of violence and conflict and so they appeared in Greek Mythology as mostly associated with its stories of strife. The god of war Ares was said to have been born in Thrace and was also heavily worshiped there; in contrast to the revulsion of his worship by many other Balkan city states. Homer recounts in the book of Odyssey that an embarrassed Ares retreated among his Thracian followers when his love affair with the goddess Aphrodite was caught and the two were promptly ensnared by Hephaestus. Tribal wars Thracian tribes fought amongst each other and they allied themselves with the Greeks against other Thracian tribes. Those allied with the Greeks were more civilized and they were usually established in settlements along the Thracian coast. The interior tribes were known as savages, retaining their barbarous habits even until the Roman period. Due to the constant conflict, these tribes have been easily conquered by the Egyptian Sesostris, the Teucrians, Mysians, and, finally the Persians under Darius Hystaspis. The tribal wars also kept Thrace from becoming a major regional power due to the lack of a central government. At the onset of the Peloponnesian War, the Thracian tribes were united under the rule of Sitalces, king of the Odrysae. It was allied with Athens during the conflict. However, the kingdom was again split into different parts after the death of king Seuthes. It was during this time when Philip of Macedon conquered a large swath of Thrace, absorbing the territory and its tribes into Macedon. Kingdoms Map of the Odrysian kingdom The Odrysian kingdom (Ancient Greek, \\"Βασιλεία Όδρυσων\\") was a union of Thracian tribes that endured between the 5th century BC and the 3rd century BC.

H. Archibald,1998, , page 149 making the kingdom prone to fragmentation. Although the kingdom was wealthy, a large proportion of its income was in kind and suitable portions had to be paid to the tribal chiefs. The army was mostly fed and paid by plunder. Sitalces was able to raise an army supposedly 150,000 strong for his invasion of Macedonia in 429 BC but these economic and political factors (plus the onset of winter) meant that this army only held together for about six weeks and any Thracian conquests were ephemeral. The Sapaeans ruled Thrace after the Odrysians until its incorporation to the Roman Empire as a province. Thrace became a Client state of Rome at 11 BC and was annexed at 46 AD. Thracian troop types and organization Infantry and Cavalry Thrace had the potential to muster a huge number of troopsThe Thracians 700 BC-AD 46 (Men-at-Arms) by Christopher Webber and Angus McBride, 2001, , page 3 though this rarely occurred.

Later native and Greek types started being used, the Greek type being rarer. Thracians used mixed Thracian and Greek equipment and armors from different time periods, to the point of wearing armors that ceased to be used elsewhere; this is something they did even in the classic era. Later they adopted Roman armaments. Thracian mercenaries Thracians were highlyThe Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, , page 168, \\"Like Thracians to the east the Illyrians were an important source of military manpower, and often served as separate contingents under their own leaders\\" sought as mercenaries due to their ferocity in battle, but they were infamous for their love of plunder. Thracian mercenaries played an important role in the affairs between Athenians and Spartans. The Odomantii were described as expensive mercenaries. In one instance in 413 BC, Dii mercenaries were so expensive to pay that after they missed the boat to Sicily the Athenians sent them home. They were hired occasionally by Persians.The Thracians 700 BC-AD 46 (Men-at-Arms) by Christopher Webber and Angus McBride, 2001, , page 8 Croesus had hired many Thracian swordsmen for the Lydian army.The Thracians 700 BC-AD 46 (Men-at- Arms) by Christopher Webber and Angus McBride, 2001, , page 33 They also served in the Republican Roman and Mithridatic armies, as well as the armies of the Diadocii. They provided up to one third of the cavalry in Macedonian armies and up to a fifth of their infantry (usually as levies or allies rather than mercenaries). They later formed one of the most important nationalities in the Roman army, contributing up to 20,000 troops at any one time to auxiliary units during the early empire. Nobility A Thracian chieftain could have access to armor and helmets. One could be equipped with a Chalcidian type helmet, a breastplate (this sort of armor is rarely found outside CreteThe Thracians 700 BC-AD 46 (Men-at-Arms) by Christopher Webber and Angus McBride, 2001, , page 34 and only one has been found in Thrace, a bell-typeThe Odrysian Kingdom of Thrace: Orpheus Unmasked (Oxford Monographs on Classical Archaeology) by Z.

Nobles would sometimes wear pectorals on their chests as a sign of rank. Navy There was no Thracian navy but there were instances of Thracians turning to piracy. The Greek cities of the coast that paid tribute to the Thracian kings did sometimes provide the Thracian kings with ships. Fortifications Even though Thracians attempted to build only oneThe Thracians 700 BC-AD 46 by Christopher Webber, , 2001, page 1,\\"the city of Seuthopolis seems to be the only significant town in Thrace not built by Greeks\\" polis, they had forts in hills built as places of refuge. Thracian villages had basic fortifications as Xenophon witnesses in Anabasis. Tacitus in his Annals describes a Roman attack against a hill fort. There were many Thracian hill forts and some were inhabited. Other fortified Thracian towns existed at places like Hellis and Kabyle.

The ground of their late commotion, not to mention the savage genius of the people, was their scorn and impatience, to have recruits raised amongst them, and all their stoutest men enlisted in our armies; accustomed as they were not even to obey their native kings further than their own humour, nor to aid them with forces but under captains of their own choosing, nor to fight against any enemy but their own borderers. Their discontents too were inflamed by a rumour which then ran current amongst them; that they were to be dispersed into different regions; and exterminated from their own, to be mixed with other nations. But before they took arms and began hostilities, they sent ambassadors to Sabinus, to represent \\"their past friendship and submission, and that the same should continue, if they were provoked by no fresh impositions: but, if like a people subdued by war, they were doomed to bondage; they had able men and steel, and souls determined upon liberty or death.\\" The ambassadors at the same time pointed to their strongholds founded upon precipices; and boasted that they had thither conveyed their wives and parents; and threatened a war intricate, hazardous and bloody.\\" Polyaenus and Strabo write how the Thracians broke their pacts of truce with trickery.Thracians The Thracians.\\"The Thracians fought against the Boeotians by lake Copais, and were defeated; then they retreated to Helicon, and made a truce with the Boeotians for a certain number of days, to give time for agreeing the terms of peace. The Boeotians, who were confident because of their recent victory and the truce that followed it, celebrated a sacrifice in honour of Athene Itonia. But at night while they still were intent on the ceremony, and engaged in festivities, the Thracians armed, and attacked them; they cut many of them to pieces, and took a great number prisoners. When the Boeotians afterwards charged them with a breach of the truce, the Thracians replied that the terms of the truce expressed a certain number of days, but said nothing concerning the nights.

His troops, assuming that they were the enemy, immediately formed up to resist them. Meanwhile the Thracians really did advance in the hope of surprising them while they were asleep; but the Greeks, being already dressed and armed, confronted the assailants.

It concerns the armed conflicts of the Dacian tribes and their kingdoms in the Balkans. Apart from conflicts between Dacians and neighboring nations and tribes, numerous wars were recorded among Dacians too. Mythological Tribal wars The Dacians fought amongst each other but were later united under Burebista. However, after his deathThe Legionary by Peter Connolly, 1998, page 14: \\"... dynamic king Burebista, a century and a half earlier, the Dacians had become the most powerful nation in central Europe, but since his death the country had been split by civil war.\\" at 44 BC, the empire again descended into conflict culminating in a full-scale civil war. This led to the division of Burebista's empire into five separate kingdoms, severely weakening the Dacian's defensive capabilities against enemies, particularly Rome. The Dacian tribes were again consolidated under Decebalus, who achieved several military victories in a series of battles with the forces of Emperor Domitian. Domitian's Dacian War The two punitive expeditions mounted as a border defense against raids of Moesia from Dacia in 86-87 AD ordered by the Emperor Titus Flavius Domitianus (Domitian) in 87 AD, and 88 AD. The first expedition was an unmitigated disaster, and the second achieved a peace, seen as unfavorable and shameful by many in Rome. Trajan's Dacian Wars Trajan's Dacian Wars. The two campaigns of conquest ordered or led by the Emperor Trajan in 101-102 AD, and 105-106 AD from Moesia across the Danube north into Dacia. Trajan's forces were successful in both cases, reducing Dacia to client state status in the first, and taking the territory over in the second. These wars involved no fewer than 13 legions.A Companion to the Roman Army (Blackwell Companions to the Ancient World) by Paul Erdkamp, 2007, page 218 The defeat reduced the Dacian territory as a mere Roman province. Rome ruled it, including the entire Transylvanian basin for 150 years. A succession of migratory waves by Visigoths, Huns, Gepids, Avars, and Slavs overran Dacia, cutting it off from the Roman and the Byzantine empires by the end of the sixth century. Dacian troop types and organization Infantry and cavalry The Dacian tribes were part of the greater Thracian family of peoples. They established a highly militarized society and, during the periods when the tribes were united under one king (82 -44 BC, 86-106 AD), posed a major threat to the Roman provinces of Lower Danube. Dacia was conquered (except for the Free Dacians) and transformed into a Roman province in 106 after a long, hard war. Dacian scale armour The most important weapon of the Dacian arsenal was the falx. This dreaded weapon, similar to a large sickle, came in two variants: a shorter, one-handed falx called a sica,Rome's Enemies (1): Germanics and Dacians (Men at Arms Series, 129) by Peter Wilcox and Gerry Embleton, 1982, page 35 and a longer two-handed version. The shorter falx was called sica (sickle) in the Dacian language. The two-handed falx was a polearm. It consisted of a three- feet long wooden shaft with a long curved iron blade of nearly-equal length attached to the end. The blade was sharpened only on the inside, and was reputed to be devastatingly effective. However, it left its user vulnerable because, using a two-handed weapon, the warrior could not also make use of a shield. Alternatively, it might be used as a hook, pulling away shields and cutting at vulnerable limbs. Using the falx, the Dacian warriors were able to counter the power of the compact, massed Roman formations. During the time of the Roman conquest of Dacia (101 - 102, 105 - 106), legionaries had reinforcing iron straps applied to their helmets. The Romans also introduced the use of leg and arm protectors (greaves and manica) as further protection against the falxes. This was one of the rare times in history where Roman armor was modified. A typical falx. Sica, a small version of the falx The Dacians were adept of surprise attacks and skilful, tactical withdrawals using the fortification system. During the wars with the Romans, fought by their last king Decebalus (87-106), the Dacians almost crushed the Roman garrisons south of the Danube in a surprise attack launched over the frozen river ( winter of 101-102 ). Only the intervention of Emperor Trajan with the main army saved the Romans from a major defeat. But, by 106, the Dacians were surrounded in their capital Sarmizegetusa. The city was taken after the Romans discovered and destroyed the capital's water supply line.

Most used only shields as a form of defense. Cavalry would be armed with a spear, a long La Tène sword and an oval shield. Most of the infantry would wield a falx and perhaps a sica and would wear no armor at all even shunning shields.

It carries coal, as well as products, to other destinations by way of connections to the North Coast Line at Rocklands and the Goonyella Line via Gregory coal mine to Oaky Creek. Together with the Moura line the two railway systems are known as the Capricornia Coal Chain. The Blackwater system is narrow gauge and electrified using 25 kV 50 Hz. The system is used by both electric and diesel locomotives. The Blackwater system has the largest route length of the four coal systems and carries the second highest tonnages on the QR network, after the Goonyella system. It is located in Central Queensland, and services the Bowen Basin. Coal is carried to the two export terminals at the Port of Gladstone; RG Tanna Coal Terminal, and Barney Point Coal Terminal. The Blackwater system also services a number of domestic users including Gladstone Power Station, Stanwell Power Station, and QCL Fisherman's Landing.Network Systems. QR National. Retrieved on 13 May 2012. The Blackwater Coal Chain services 15 mines, operated by BMA, Xstrata, Rio Tinto, Curragh, Ensham, Felix, and Jellinbah. Haulage is expected to progressively increase in the Blackwater system as haulage contracts, combined with enquiries from coal companies for additional haulage capacity (domestic and export), exceeds 80 Mpta by 2008–09. The Blackwater system consists of 994 km of track, of which approximately 160 km is duplicated. 823 km of track is electrified. Callemondah and Bluff yards are used to provision train services. The system is operated from the Rockhampton Control Centre utilising two safe working systems - Remote Control Signalling (RCS) and Direct Traffic Control (DTC).

History Vitturi Castle was built by the aristocratic family Vitturi from Trogir, at the end of the 15th century.http://www.culturenet.hr/default.aspx?ID=23246 Two noblemen from Trogir, Nikola and Jerolim Vitturi, built the castle in order to provide protection not only for the Vitturi family but also for the population of the nearby village of Ostrog. The castle was built in the style of a luxurious renaissance palace and it was completed in 1564. It consisted of a residential building and two defence towers and it was connected to the mainland with a drawbridge. In the 18th century the drawbridge was replaced with a stone bridge. Near the castle there is a classicistic park dating from the second half of the 18th century. The park was also designed by the Vitturi family. In 1968 it was proclaimed a monument of park architecture. Nowadays, the renovated Vitturi castle has become the cultural centre of Kaštel Lukšić, as a place where numerous exhibitions, concerts and plays are held. In addition to that, the town museum and other cultural institutions are situated in the former residential part of the castle. The Vitturi castle is famous not only for its beauty but also for a legend concerning one of its inhabitants – Dobrila Vitturi.  Legend of Miljenko and Dobrila  The legend of Miljenko and Dobrila is a tragic story about two lovers from Kaštel Lukšić, who are often described as the Croatian Romeo and Juliet. The legend was used as a basis for a number of novels, operas and plays. The story dates from the second half of the 17th century, when two noble families lived in Kaštel Lukšić – the Vitturi family with their daughter Dobrila and the Rušinić family with their son Miljenko. According to the legend, Miljenko and Dobrila fell in love, but they had to keep their relationship secret because of a long-lasting feud between their families. When their parents found out about their relationship, they decided to separate them. Miljenko was sent off to Venice, while Dobrila’s father arranged for her to marry a much older nobleman from Trogir. However, Miljenko found out about his plans and came back from Venice just in time to stop the wedding. As a result, he was banished from Kaštel Lukšić and Dobrila was sent to a convent. However, she escaped with the intention of being reunited with Miljenko and marrying him secretly. When Dobrila's father found out that she had escaped from the convent, he decided to bring her home at any cost. He sent a messenger to find the two lovers and to tell them that he would no longer oppose their marriage and that they could come home. The lovers accepted his proposal, returned to Kaštel Lukšić and got married. But when the wedding celebration was over, Dobrila’s father, consumed with rage, killed Miljenko. Several months later Dobrila died of sadness. Her only wish was to be buried next to Miljenko. Their grave can be found in the church of St. John in Kaštel Lukšić, and it is famous for the inscription ‘Rest in peace, lovers’.

The Treaty of Soldin () was signed on 21 January 1466 at Soldin (now Myślibórz) by the Brandenburgian elector Frederick II and the Pomeranian dukes Eric II and Wartislaw X.Heitz (1995), p. 194 It was mediated by the town of Stettin (now Szczecin). The treaty temporarily settled a conflict about the succession of Otto III, Duke of Pomerania, who had died without issue: Emperor Frederick III, elector Frederick II as well as Eric II and Wartislaw X of Pomerania claimed to be the rightful heir of Otto's share of the Duchy of Pomerania.Materna (1995) p. 205 The Brandenburgian elector and the Pomeranian dukes bypassed the emperor's claims, and settled for a solution where the Pomeranian dukes took the Duchy of Pomerania, including Otto's as well as their own shares, as a fief of the Electorate of Brandenburg. The implementation of the treaty failed due to the refusal of parts of the Pomeranian nobility and the town of Stettin to obey to the treaty's terms.Heitz (1995), p. 195 Neither did the Pomeranian dukes enforce the treaty, and successfully intrigued against it at the emperor's court. Brandenburg tried to enforce the treaty militarily, yet initially with limited success.Heitz (1995), pp. 196–199 Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor declared the treaty null and void in 1469,Heitz (1995), p. 198 but confirmed Brandenburg's claims in 1470.Heitz (1995), p. 199 The treaty of Soldin was superseded by the Second Peace of Prenzlau in May 1472, that ended the war and confirmed Pomerania as a Brandenburgian fief.Heitz (1995), p. 200 Background Brandenburg and the Duchy of Pomerania were part of a long- standing dispute regarding the status of the latter. While Brandenburg regarded Pomerania to be her legal fief, the Pomeranian dukes rejected such claims. Both sides were at times successful in convincing the Holy Roman Emperor of their respective view, and frequently, the conflict resulted in warfare. The most recent of these armed conflicts was fought between 1444 and 1448 about territory in the Uckermark, claimed by both Pomerania and Brandenburg.Heitz (1995), p. 192 The First Peace of Prenzlau (1448) had ended this war by dividing the area in a Brandenburgian and a Pomeranian part. The Duchy of Pomerania was itself internally divided between various members of the House of Pomerania, each of whom ruled a part (\\"Teilherzogtum\\") of it named after its respective primary residence. In 1455, Frederick II, Elector of Brandenburg had bought back the Neumark from the Teutonic Order State,Kroll (2006), p. 37 and was searching for an access to the Baltic Sea for his land- locked electorate. Eric II of Pomerania During the 1450s, the Pomeranian dukes faced fierce opposition of the Hanseatic towns within their duchy. Stralsund refused to accept the dukes as overlords at all in 1451, and reconciled with the dukes only in a peace of 12 July 1454. In 1457, burghers of Stralsund and Greifswald assaulted duke Eric II and his entourage – Eric barely escaped. Also in 1457, the Hanseatic towns of Stralsund, Greifswald, Demmin and Anklam conclude an alliance directed against the Pomeranian dukes.Heitz (1995), p. 193 In 1459, Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, renounced all freedoms previously granted by the emperors to the Pomeranian dukes. The same year, Eric of Pomerania's death caused a conflict between the remaining dukes Eric II, Wartislaw X and Otto III about Eric's heritage – Eric II claimed all for himself. This led Otto III and Wartislaw X to ally with the elector of Brandenburg on 6 September 1459, and with Denmark on 27 July 1462, both alliances were directed against Eric II. The dukes however reconciled in 1463. An epidemic wave of the Black Death had reached Pomerania in 1451. Many members of the House of Pomerania fell victim to this epidemic, including Otto III of Pomerania-Stettin,Buchholz (1999), p. 183Materna (1995), p. 204 who died without issue on 10 September 1464. The remaining dukes Wartislaw X and Erich II on one side, and the Brandenburgian elector on the other side both claim Otto's Teilherzogtum. Negotiations in Prenzlau on 13 January 1465 ended without a result.Heitz (1995), p. 194 Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor initially rejected both the Pomeranian and the Brandenburgian claims, and considered Pomerania-Stettin as his personal property. On 21 March, the emperor drafted a document confirming Brandenburg's claim, yet this title was kept in Nuremberg and had to be bailed out with 37,000 gulden. This did not happen, as the elector could not afford to pay this sum. Brandenburgian- Pomeranian negotiations in April and May in Prenzlau failed. Provisions Frederick II \\"Eisenzahn\\" (\\"Iron tooth\\") of Brandenburg The treaty included the following provisions: *The Duchy of Pomerania becomes a fief of the Electorate of Brandenburg. Erich II and Wartislaw X pledge allegiance to the elector. This does not affect the oaths of the Pomeranian nobility, who had to pledge allegiance to both the Pomeranian dukes and the Brandenburgian elector. The elector of Brandenburg has to justify this action before the Holy Roman Emperor. Allegiance may only to be pledged after previous mutual consultations. *The Pomeranian dukes continue to receive all income from their duchy. *Fiefs inside the duchy are to be handed out only by the Pomeranian dukes and the Brandenburgian elector in common. *The Brandenburgian elector is obliged to protect the Duchy of Pomerania. Furthermore, Brandenburg and Pomerania enter a defensive alliance. *The Pomeranian dukes are obliged to not unduly burden the Pomeranian nobility, and guarantee them certain freedoms. *Brandenburg and Pomerania allow free trade and traffic. Failed implementation On 10 March, Wartislaw X of Pomerania and Frederick II of Brandenburg met in Gartz (Oder) to put the Pomeranian nobility under oath. However, they had to cancel the ceremony due to insufficient attention. On 26 April, Stettin mailed the elector that it refused to pledge allegiance. The Pomeranian delegate at the emperor's court, Jaroslaw Barnekow, pursued the cassation of the elector's title since the summer, and was successful on 14 October when the emperor forbade the Pomeranian dukes to take the Duchy of Pomerania as a fief without his approval. The respective imperial note arrived in Pomerania in February 1467. Aftermath War between Brandenburg and Pomerania On 8 May 1467, Mecklenburg and the Electorate of Saxony admonished the Pomeranian dukes to obey by the treaty and threatened them with an economical boycott, while the Hanseatic League, especially Lübeck, endorsed Stettin's refusal to pledge allegiance to Brandenburg.Heitz (1995), p. 196 On 2 May 1468, Brandenburg sent a note to Stettin insisting on the implementation of the treaty and threatened with war, which eventually broke out in mid-July. Forces of Brandenburgian ally Mecklenburg crossed the Tollense river into Vorpommern, while Brandenburgian forces attacked from the South. In the following battles, Brandenburg sacked Löcknitz and Gartz (Oder) in July, and Mecklenburg sacked Altentreptow in early August. After further Brandenburgian and Mecklenburgian gains, Stralsund and Greifswald mediated a truce in late August.Heitz (1995), p. 197 Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor The truce however was not obeyed. Pomeranian forces invaded Brandenburgian territory and re-took Altentreptow on 7 or 8 September. On 21 September, peace negotiations failed, and Meckenburg renewed her alliance with Brandenburg. In October, Pomeranian forces sacked Bahn and stormed Gartz, yet were repelled from the latter. On 12 December, the Pomeranian delegates Jaroslaw Barnekow, Bernd Broke and Klaus Goldbeck offer a peace at Prenzlau, but Brandenburg refused due to ongoing attacks by the Pomeranian forces. Negotiations at Prenzlau continue, and on 8 January 1469, the Pomeranian dukes Eric II and Wartislaw X swear in public on Prenzlau's marketplace to obey the treaty of Soldin, and that the duchy will pledge allegiance within the next eight days. On 15 January, some Pomeranian nobles actually give the oath to the elector, but Stettin openly refuses again in May, and is again backed by the Hanseatic League. The Pomeranian dukes meanwhile intrigued with the emperor to declare the Soldin treaty void. On 14 July 1469, the emperor issued a decree that nullified the treaty of Soldin, confirmed Pomerania's imperial immediacy and forbade Brandenburgian actions against the duchy. On the same day, Pomeranian forces invaded the Brandenburgian Neumark, but were defeated in the Battle of Schivelbein. On 25 July, the elector mounted a counter-offensive, reaching Ueckermünde on 30 July. The town, supported by Stralsund and Stettin, was besieged by combined Brandenburgian and Mecklenburgian forces until 10 August. On 21 October 1469, Pomerania and Mecklenburg conclude a peace treaty, and oblige themselves to maintain neutrality in case one of them is at war with Brandenburg. In May 1470, Eric II of Pomerania again invades the Neumark. Second Peace of Prenzlau On 12 December 1470, the emperor confirmed the Brandenburgian claim to Pomerania-Stettin. Furthermore, he addressed the Polish king on 9 January 1470 to support Brandenburg against Pomerania. On 6 August, the emperor forbade the Pomeranian dukes to hinder Brandenburg's appropriation of Pomerania-Stettin, and ordered the nobles to pledge allegiance to the elector. On 16 September, Pomerania and Brandenburg agree on a truce in Mescherin, scheduled until 24 June 1472. The Second Peace of Prenzlau, concluded between Brandenburg and Pomerania on 30 May 1472, finally settled the dispute in Brandenburg's favour: Brandenburg received Pomerania- Stettin, and Pomerania-Wolgast became a Brandenburgian fief.
