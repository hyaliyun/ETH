It was established in the mid-19th century. The main dwelling is a sophisticated Italianate style wood frame house. It and the other buildings have remained mostly intact since their construction. The farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Buildings and grounds The farm is located on the south side of Indian Falls Road (Genesee County Route 4), a half-mile (1 km) west of where the road bends to the south and crosses the New York State Thruway and east of New York State Route 77 just south of Tonawanda Creek and the hamlet of Indian Falls. The terrain is generally level and the area rural, with most land used for fields and houses clustered along the road. The Mt. Pleasant property is a parcel bordered by the Thruway on the south. A southern portion on the opposite side of the Thruway is no longer visually and physically connected with the farm and is not included with the listing. An original circular driveway leads into a triangular, uncleared northern portion of the property where the buildings are located. Hedgerows of mature trees separate this grassy area from the farmland. A three-foot (1 m) retaining wall of Medina sandstone sets off the main house from the road. The farm has a total of eight contributing resources, five buildings and three structures. Main house The house itself is a clapboard-sided stricture with five sections. Its main block is a two-story rectangular structure with a gently pitched hipped roof pierced by a square central cupola. Both it and the house itself have wide overhanging eaves supported by paired brackets. The four-over-four double-hung sash windows are flanked by louvered wooden shutters and topped by wooden lintels with miniature brackets. Its main entrance is on the west elevation, sheltered by a porch with clustered columns supporting a roof with decorative scrollwork balustrade. From this side projects a one-and-a-half- story wing with a shallow hip roof. It has a porch on its north facade with a similar treatment to the one on the main block. A brick flue pierces its roof at the west. Three segmental gable-roofed additions project to the south of the west wing. The westernmost is one and a half stories, with wide projecting eaves supported by paired brackets with pendants. A brick chimney pierces the roof at the center. The wing's west side has a small porch similar to the other two, and a shed-roofed projection on its east. On its rear is the carriage house, with a belfry on top, and on its south the privy, with its original planked door. The main house's floor plan has remained relatively unchanged, save for some changes to the bedrooms on the first floor. Many of its finishes are original as well, such as the door and window surrounds, moldings, wainscoting, high ceilings and pine flooring. The front hall and parlor (now a bedroom) have their original plaster ceiling medallions. The cold pantry has slate walls and the kitchen pantry its original marble shelves. The stairway to the cupola has been enclosed, the only change on the second floor. Outbuildings Due south of the main house is a garage, believed to be the original house on the property. It is a one-story gabled wood frame structure with its original vertical board siding, paneled door and shed-roofed addition on the west. To its east is the original smokehouse, a one-story brick building on a stone foundation with a shallow hip roof. The barn is to the west. It is a two-and-a-half-story structure with vertical siding, gambrel roof and assorted window configurations, with large sliding doors on the east elevation. On the east side of the barnyard formed between it and a second barn formerly to its east is one of the original wells, the three contributing structures. The other two wells are to the east and west of the main house. History The farm was established around 1847 by Abram Mook, a German American from Pennsylvania who bought several tracts in the area from the Holland Land Company. In addition to clearing and farming them, he built what is now Indian Falls Road from North Pembroke Road to the old Indian trail that is now NY 77. The 1850 census lists his net worth at $3,500 ($ in contemporary dollars). In 1854 he bought the two parcels that make up the current farm and moved onto it. Records from that year show that the current garage was in existence at the time; it may have been the family residence. Mook and his brothers built a suspension bridge across the Tonawanda to connect their farms; the 1860 census shows that his family had grown by two and his wealth considerably increased. The following year he hired seven carpenters to build the current house, replacing one on another nearby piece of land he owned that had burned down. The yellow pine and decorative features were shipped to Lockport on the Erie Canal and then delivered to the construction site. The building contrasts the ornamentation of a sophisticated Italianate villa of the time with the form of a more vernacular farmhouse of the time, particularly the projecting wings. Mook died in 1908. His son lost the house to foreclosure the next year, and it and the farm became the property of the Stang brothers for $5,210 ($ in contemporary dollars). In 1945 they sold it to LaVerne Lamkin, who owned it until the early 21st century.

The women's first team are members of the South West Regional Women's Football League Division One East, train at New College, Swindon and play their home matches in nearby Watchfield, Vale of White Horse. Founded in 1967, they are one of the oldest extant women's and girls' football clubs in England. The club also runs a reserve team and several age-group teams in its youth system. In 2011 the club launched an associated men's team, who compete in the local Swindon & District League. History Early years In 1967 the club was formed by female Swindon Town supporters, who had been in the club's marching band but decided that they wanted to play football. When they watched Swindon Town playing at Watford, they were invited to the chairman's lounge at Vicarage Road. It was the Watford chairman who suggested that they call themselves Swindon Spitfires, in honour of their home town's links to the iconic Supermarine Spitfire aircraft.In 1940 Spitfire production switched to Swindon after the factory in Southampton was bombed by the Luftwaffe. Ron Hyde, whose daughter was a player, served as the team's first manager. The team debuted in June 1967, losing 10‚Äì5 to Calne. Two goals from Jo Swinden and a Sylvia Carson hat-trick completed the Spitfires' scoring. Another Carson hat-trick and one from club captain Dee Allison secured a 6‚Äì6 draw with Calne in the rematch. The Spitfires secured their first win in their ninth match, when they beat Cheltenham 4‚Äì1. The team then enjoyed sustained local success, often attracting three to four hundred supporters to home matches staged at the W.D. & H.O. Wills factory sports grounds in Swindon. In May 1969 they beat Emgals of Leicester 2‚Äì1 at Bedworth Oval to win the first Midland Ladies Football League Cystic Fibrosis Cup. A controversial 5‚Äì0 win over Newbury Golden Eagles in September 1969 saw one player from each team shown the red card for trading punches. In June 1970 Swindon Spitfires were one of the 44 clubs to be represented at the Women's Football Association's (WFA) inaugural annual general meeting at Caxton Hall. They affiliated to the Home Counties League, which also contained Southampton WFC, the dominant team of the era.There was no national women's football league in England until 1991. Nuneaton Wanderers beat the Spitfires 5‚Äì2 in the Heart of England Open Cup final in May 1971 at Cheltenham. In 1973‚Äì74 Swindon Spitfires reached the semi-final of the national FA Women's Cup (then known as the Mitre Challenge Trophy). In the quarter-final the Spitfires beat Brighton GPO 1‚Äì0. They lost the semi-final 2‚Äì0 to eventual Cup winners Foden's. In the third place play- off, staged as a curtain raiser to the final at Bedford Town, Swindon Spitfires faced a Westthorn United team containing Rose Reilly and Edna Neillis. Split During the 1992‚Äì93 season, Swindon Spitfires had been in protracted negotiations with Swindon Town over a merger with the men's English Football League club. The Spitfires' first team manager Kerri Garwood unexpectedly made a unilateral agreement with Swindon Town to form their new women's team, taking most of the Spitfires' squad with her. This left Swindon Spitfires with only five players. Although they managed to attract new players and survive, a degree of enmity remained and developed into a longstanding rivalry between the clubs. Later years In 1995‚Äì96 Swindon Spitfires won the Southern Region Women's Football League. They were defeated by Tottenham Hotspur in a play-off for promotion to the FA Women's Premier League Southern Division. A runners-up position in the 2014‚Äì15 South West Regional Women's Football League Premier Division secured promotion to the FA Women's Premier League Division One South West. During the subsequent 2015‚Äì16 FA Women's Premier League season the club withdrew from the league after a series of heavy defeats, planning to regroup at a lower level. In their 50th anniversary year the club won the Wiltshire League and were admitted to an enlarged South West Regional Women's Football League for 2017‚Äì18. In September 2018 New College, Swindon officially opened a new artificial turf pitch, with Swindon Spitfires among the listed partner clubs permitted to train at the facility. Also that month the club agreed a sponsorship deal with Swindon-based magician Mark Burford. The Maulls Chris Maull helped Ron Hyde to found Swindon Spitfires and after a period of absence returned to the club in 1974. In 1976 he married Bev Maull (n√©e Thompson), who had joined the club as a player in 1970 after a successful trial. The couple became \\"instrumental\\" in fulfilling a series of different roles at the club over the following decades. They attended Wembley Stadium in August 2015 after being nominated for a national Football Association (FA) award and were praised by Geoff Hurst, who described their dedication as: \\"absolutely astonishing\\". In 2015‚Äì16 Bev remained an active player at the club despite celebrating her 60th birthday during the season. She intended to take up walking football from 2016‚Äì17.

He was the nephew of Yousef al-Khalidi, who was mayor of Jerusalem from 1899 to 1907.Kasmieh, Khairieh. \\"Ruhi al-Khalidi, 1864-1913: A Symbol of the Cultural Movement in Palestine Towards the End of Ottoman Rule\\", 1992 In 1908, he was one of three delegates elected to represent Jerusalem in the new Ottoman government run by the Young Turks and later become the deputy to the head of parliament (1911).Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs Biography The family that Ruhi Khalidi was born into was and still is a very prominent Palestinian family in Jerusalem. The family still runs the Khalidi Library in the Old City of Jerusalem. When the library was first established, Khalidi had a hand in making sure the library was more available to the wider public. His interest in French writers contributed to the collection's literature by Montesquieu and Victor Hugo. Khalidi studied Islamic sciences and philosophy in Paris, was a lecturer at Sorbonne University, Paris, was a scholar and teacher at the Institute for Foreign Languages in Paris and was appointed Counsel General of the Ottoman Empire in Bordeaux, France, from 1898 to 1908. Ruhi was a high-profile critic of the earliest stages of Zionism, although he made a sincere effort to better understand the movement by attending Yiddish plays, briefly studying at the Alliance Israelite School in Jerusalem and also owning Hebrew texts. He was one of the first Palestinians to study modern Hebrew, and he left behind a workbook in which he transliterated a whole host of Hebrew-Arabic cognates and other basic vocabulary. Zachary Foster, \\"The Untold Story of Palestinians Who Learned Hebrew, 'Palestine Studies Blog,' 28 October 2015. ( He also visited Zionist settlements and wrote extensively about them in his unpublished book titled \\"Zionism and the Zionist Question\\". While writing the book he kept it secret in fear of \\"political repercussions involved with even writing about a nationalistic movement\\".Marcus, Amy Docker \\"Jerusalem 1913\\", 2007 The book was a wide-ranging analysis that drew on his reading of the Hebrew bible and his encounters with the Zionist settlers. These visits were an attempt to build a case against the Zionist movement. Khalidi wanted to restrict Jewish immigration to Palestine and opposed land sales to Jews. His sentiments were based on the fear that Zionists wanted to create their own state with an exclusive social and political system. He understood that the Zionists were attempting to create a nation where they would no longer be second class citizens or outsiders, but he felt their goals would be detrimental to the Ottoman Empire and all the people in it as a whole. Khalidi was criticized by Zionists and non-Zionists for wanting to make illegal the purchase of land not only by unregistered Jewish immigrants, but also Jews that were natural citizens of the Ottoman Empire. When Zionist Leader, Jacobus Kann, published a book calling for the establishment of a Jewish army in the name of the Zionist movement, Khalidi had the book translated to French and distributed to other Palestinian nationalists in order to call attention to the militant side of the Zionist movement. He also signed petitions and helped lobby the governor's and sultan's offices to enact stronger restrictions on Jewish immigration. Khalidi saw his destiny as firmly tied to the Ottoman Empire and was not an Arab Nationalist. He had ties to the Young Turks and even wrote one of the first copies of their political manifesto. Khalidi died of typhoid in 1913 while working as deputy to the head of Parliament in Istanbul (Constantinople). Some members of his family believed he had actually been poisoned because his beliefs. His unfinished book was never published and was inherited by his older brother. Toward the end of his life, he expressed anger at the Ottoman government for not recognizing the threat that the Zionist posed against Palestine.

It contains several of Romanesque Revival style buildings from the last decades of the 19th century and the first two of the early 20th. Most were built after the village banned wooden buildings following two devastating fires in the area. One is currently used as Bergen's municipal building. Several of the buildings have intact cast iron storefronts. It was designated a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Geography and buildings The district consists of 11 buildings along the west side of the street. Two, 10 and 12 South Lake Street, are south of Buffalo Street. The remainder, 11‚Äì27 North Lake, are to the north. The CSX railroad tracks bound the district on the north. All fill most of their lots, for a total area of and are contributing properties to the district's historic character. All but one, 23 North Lake Street, are two-story structures with flat roofs. Many have decorative details such as cornices with corbels, brackets and dentils. Another common feature is the cast iron storefronts, most of which have similar decorative details and remain intact from their original construction. The upper stories are used for offices and residences. The 11 buildings are: *10 South Lake Street, a two-story, four-bay flat-roofed brick Romanesque Revival structure with a cast iron storefront. It was built in 1888, with the original cast-iron cornice replaced in 1930. *Masonic Temple, 12 South Lake Street. The organization built this to replace its original building, destroyed in the 1906 fire. It is also a two-story brick building with a flat roof, but is only two bays wide, with large tripartite windows and segmental arch treatments. *Tulley Block, 11 North Lake Street. The same size, shape and material as 10 South Lake, its front facade is topped with a pedimented parapet with \\"1886\\", the year of its construction, in the entablature and a finial rising from the crest. A similar feature on the 10-bay south facade, along Buffalo Street, has \\"Tulley Block\\" in the entablature, and a mural of scenes from local history. The second story has a projecting bay window with a small cast iron balustrade. It is currently used as the village hall. *13 North Lake Street. One of the first new buildings erected after the 1880 fire, it is like the others to the south save for its three-bay width. It, too, has a parapet and pediment with date in the entablature. The cast iron storefront retains its original metal coping, corbel, finials and brackets. *15 North Lake Street. A copy of its neighbor to the south, built a year later with no parapet. The cornice was altered in 1906 and a brick veneer was added around 1950. *17 North Lake Street. A four-bay structure otherwise similar to its southern neighbor. *19 North Lake Street.

Another two-story four-bay building dating to 1881. Its distinctive features are a detailed corbeled cornice and segmental arched windows with radiating voussoirs. *23 North Lake Street. The youngest contributing property in the district, and the only one to be one story. This small grocery store was built in 1921, with stone coping and decorative brickwork. Its storefront is still the original cast iron. *25 North Lake Street. A single-bay building otherwise similar to its other neighbors. Built in 1913, it has similar decorative brickwork to its neighbor at 21 and a detailed corbelled cornice. The second story bay window was resided in shingle in 1971, the storefront has also been altered. *Housel Bank, 27 North Lake Street. Three bays wide and otherwise similar, this dates to 1906. It has a corbeled cornice and the only quoins in the district. The second story has tripartite windows with flat brick arches. Its storefront was also altered in 1971. alt=An old map on yellowed paper headlined \\"Plan of Bergen\\" showing the businesses there, the roads and the railroad line History Bergen, first settled in 1801, began growing as a small hamlet that served the farms around it. This accelerated after 1836 when the Buffalo and Rochester Railroad was built just north of it. The New York Central's absorption of the railroad in 1853 further fueled development. Around the Civil War, Bergen's downtown had four blocks of frame commercial buildings. In early 1866, a fire destroyed the buildings on three blocks of the west side of Lake Street in the present historic district. The community's economy was strong enough to absorb the loss and rebuild. Growth continued and Bergen incorporated as a village in 1877. Three years later, another fire in the same area destroyed 45 buildings and structures, 31 of which were businesses. Frame buildings were prohibited as a result, and the replacement buildings were brick. Within two years of the fire the buildings at 13 through 27 North Lake were built, with cast iron storefronts and Romanesque Revival detailing representing the trends of the time. The Tulley Block at the corner with Buffalo Street came along in 1886. Bergen was at its most prosperous during the next decades. New businesses, such as a cigar factory, creamery and gas and coal works, were built in the area. Another fire, in 1906, destroyed older buildings at the north end of the row. They were replaced more slowly, with only 25 North Lake going up immediately afterwards. Seven years later, in 1913, it was joined by 27 North Lake next door. The two show touches, like patterned brickwork, more typical of early 20th century vernacular commercial buildings. The Masonic Temple, also destroyed in the fire, built a new home at 12 South Lake Street. The empty space left by the 1906 fire was finally filled in 1921 with 23 Lake Street, a grocery store that is today the only one-story building in the district. That would be the last significant building in it. Bergen and its industries went into decline in the Great Depression. The Housel Bank at 27 North Lake closed. Later the railroads were displaced by the construction of interstates such as the nearby Interstate 490 and New York State Thruway. In an attempt under urban renewal in the late 1960s and early 1970s to revive Bergen's downtown, the east side of Lake Street was largely demolished in favor of newer buildings. The village has subsequently recovered somewhat as a bedroom community midway between the larger communities of Rochester and Batavia. The village has made Tulley Block its offices, and some of the storefronts are home to businesses again. A few have been altered, but the district retains its historical appearance.

Therefore, it is important to know the hervotype of a HERV insertion as the sequences can give more information on their ages.

Background and early life A native of Lurgan, Gort, County Galway, √ì Fathaigh was the fifth of six children (and third son) of Laurence and Bridget √ì Fathaigh. Like most of their neighbours, the family were tenant farmers \\"who lived in a three-roomed house and raised grains, root crops and livestock for sale at local markets. They also maintained a few outbuildings for their animals, indicating that the family was able to invest in some improvements on their farm.\\" Growing up amid the Irish Land War and Home Rule, √ì Fathaigh ‚Äì whose family spoke Irish at home ‚Äì joined the Gaelic League. He was certified to teach Irish in national schools in 1907 and two years later became the full-time m√∫inteoir taistil (travelling teacher) for the Gort area. He regularly cycled all over the district each week, his night classes been as large as 150 pupils. Irish Volunteer He joined the Irish Volunteers in 1914, possibly becoming a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood around the same time. His older brothers, M√≠che√°l and Se√°n were also Volunteers, while their youngest sister, Mary, was secretary of the local Cumann na mBan. Liam Mellows was a regular visitor to the family home. His participation in the Easter Rebellion of 1916 was cut short by his arrest at Kinvara presbytery, while the main group of over six hundred Galway volunteers gathered near Athenry and Oranmore under Liam Mellows and Larry Lardner. Active service in County Galway After the failure of the rising, √ì Fathaigh served time for penal servitude in England till released in 1917. With the start of the Irish War of Independence he was on the run, serving as an intelligence officer. He was arrested in January 1920 and was imprisoned in England. He participated in the ten-day hunger strike at London's Wormwood Scrubs prison in 1920. He escaped on 16 May, arriving back in the Gort area in June. Over the following year his friend, Joe Howley, and informant, Constable Kearney of the Royal Irish Constabulary, were killed by the Black and Tans, while other events included the killings of Eileen Quinn, Fr. Michael Griffin, the Loughnane brothers, Frank Shawe-Taylor and Captain C.E.N. Blake. Following the death of the latter, his wife and two fellow officers at the Ballyturin ambush, √ì Fathaigh's family home was burned by Crown forces, after which they ran riot in Gort. After the Truce of 1922, he was congratulated for his efforts from Michael Collins. However, he took the Anti-Treaty side in the Irish Civil War. Later life After the war, he earned a degree in Celtic Studies from National University of Ireland, Galway, teaching in his locality. In later years he worked as a Health Board clerk for Galway County Council and was secretary of the committee which erected a monument to Liam Mellows in Eyre Square.

Details In road bicycle racing different courses favour different types of rider depending on a range of environmental conditions such as terrain, climate and distance. Flat courses often finish in a bunch sprint, which favours specialist sprinters who can ride fastest over the last few hundred metres of the race. Mountainous courses favour lightweight, lean riders with a particularly high power output to weight ratio, enabling them to ascend the mountains efficiently. The time trial discipline is mastered by the riders who can produce a sustained high power output, over short to medium distance. The rouleur is a consistent all rounder who can ride well over most types of course. A rouleur will often work as a domestique in support of their team leader, a sprinter or a climber on their team. The best chance for a rouleur to win a stage is by breaking away from the main bunch during the race to win from a small group of riders that does not contain the sprint specialists. The breakaway is most likely to succeed in the undulating transition stages of multi-stage road races, that are neither mountainous nor flat. Examples of such racers include Jens Voigt, Sylvain Chavanel, Ben King, Sandy Casar, Pierrick F√©drigo, Luis Le√≥n S√°nchez, J√©r√©my Roy and Jacky Durand.

Biography Born Francis Fiorenza in 1941, as a young man he entered St. Mary's Seminary and University in Baltimore, Maryland, from which he earned the degree of Master of Divinity, even though he did not intend to pursue ordination. In 1963 he won a fellowship to study theology in Germany under the Jesuit theologian Karl Rahner at the University of Munich. Because that university would not accept doctoral candidates to work under Rahner, he instead enrolled at the University of M√ºnster, where he eventually earned the degree of Doctor of Theology, having studied under Johann Baptist Metz and Joseph Ratzinger (the future Pope Benedict XVI). It was while studying there that he met his future wife, Elisabeth Sch√ºssler Fiorenza, a feminist Catholic theologian. Rahner transferred to M√ºnster two years later, so he was able to accomplish his original goal. Now Francis Sch√ºssler Fiorenza as a result of his marriage, he returned to the United States with his wife, where they obtained teaching positions at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. Subsequent to that, he taught at Villanova University in Pennsylvania, and The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. In 1986, Fiorenza joined the faculty of the Harvard Divinity School, where his wife also became a professor. His primary interests are in the fields of fundamental or foundational theology, in which he explores the significance of contemporary hermeneutical theories as well as neo-pragmatic criticisms of foundationalism. His writings on political theology engage recent theories of justice, especially those of John Rawls and J√ºrgen Habermas, and have dealt with issues of work and welfare. He has also written on the history of 19th- and 20th-century theology, focusing on both Roman Catholic and Protestant theologians. Fiorenza was awarded the Henry Luce III Fellowship for 2005-06 for research in the history of 20th-century Roman Catholic theology, namely, the direction known as the nouvelle th√©ologie (\\"new theology\\"). This was a school of thought which originated at the Jesuit seminary of Lyons, France, and the work of the Jesuit theologian Henri de Lubac, and which sought to explore a perspective in theology from the earlier roots of the Church, prior to Scholasticism and the theology of the Council of Trent. Foundational Theology: Jesus and the Church is one of his earliest and best-known books. He has published widely, with more than 150 essays in the areas of fundamental theology, hermeneutics, and political theology, as well as several other books.

History A fundamental question about Fourier series, asked by Fourier himself at the beginning of the 19th century, is whether the Fourier series of a continuous function converges pointwise to the function. By strengthening the continuity assumption slightly one can easily show that the Fourier series converges everywhere. For example, if a function has bounded variation then its Fourier series converges everywhere to the local average of the function. In particular, if a function is continuously differentiable then its Fourier series converges to it everywhere. This was proven by Dirichlet, who expressed his belief that he would soon be able to extend his result to cover all continuous functions. Another way to obtain convergence everywhere is to change the summation method. For example, Fej√©r's theorem shows that if one replaces ordinary summation by Ces√†ro summation then the Fourier series of any continuous function converges uniformly to the function. Further, it is easy to show that the Fourier series of any L2 function converges to it in L2 norm. After Dirichlet's result, several experts, including Dirichlet, Riemann, Weierstrass and Dedekind, stated their belief that the Fourier series of any continuous function would converge everywhere. This was disproved by Paul du Bois-Reymond, who showed in 1876 that there is a continuous function whose Fourier series diverges at one point. The almost-everywhere convergence of Fourier series for L2 functions was postulated by , and the problem was known as Luzin's conjecture (up until its proof by ). showed that the analogue of Carleson's result for L1 is false by finding such a function whose Fourier series diverges almost everywhere (improved slightly in 1926 to diverging everywhere). Before Carleson's result, the best known estimate for the partial sums sn of the Fourier series of a function in Lp was : s_n(x)=o( \\\\log (n)^{1/p})\\\\text{ almost everywhere}, \\\\, proved by Kolmogorov‚ÄìSeliverstov‚ÄìPlessner for p = 2, by G. H. Hardy for p = 1, and by Littlewood‚ÄìPaley for p > 1 . This result had not been improved for several decades, leading some experts to suspect that it was the best possible and that Luzin's conjecture was false. Kolmogorov's counterexample in L1 was unbounded in any interval, but it was thought to be only a matter of time before a continuous counterexample was found. Carleson said in an interview with that he started by trying to find a continuous counterexample and at one point thought he had a method that would construct one, but realized eventually that his approach could not work. He then tried instead to prove Luzin's conjecture since the failure of his counterexample convinced him that it was probably true. Carleson's original proof is exceptionally hard to read, and although several authors have simplified the argument there are still no easy proofs of his theorem. Expositions of the original paper include , , , and . published a new proof of Hunt's extension which proceeded by bounding a maximal operator. This, in turn, inspired a much simplified proof of the L2 result by , explained in more detail in . The books and also give proofs of Carleson's theorem. showed that for any set of measure 0 there is a continuous periodic function whose Fourier series diverges at all points of the set (and possibly elsewhere). When combined with Carleson's theorem this shows that there is a continuous function whose Fourier series diverges at all points of a given set of reals if and only if the set has measure 0. The extension of Carleson's theorem to Lp for p > 1 was stated to be a \\"rather obvious\\" extension of the case p = 2 in Carleson's paper, and was proved by . Carleson's result was improved further by to the space Llog+(L)log+log+(L) and by to the space Llog+(L)log+log+log+(L). (Here log+(L) is log(L) if L>1 and 0 otherwise, and if œÜ is a function then œÜ(L) stands for the space of functions f such that œÜ(|f(x)|) is integrable.) improved Kolmogorov's counterexample by finding functions with everywhere-divergent Fourier series in a space slightly larger than Llog+(L)1/2. One can ask if there is in some sense a largest natural space of functions whose Fourier series converge almost everywhere. The simplest candidate for such a space that is consistent with the results of Antonov and Konyagin is Llog+(L). The extension of Carleson's theorem to Fourier series and integrals in several variables is made more complicated as there are many different ways in which one can sum the coefficients; for example, one can sum over increasing balls, or increasing rectangles. Convergence of rectangular partial sums (and indeed general polygonal partial sums) follows from the one-dimensional case, but the spherical summation problem is still open for L2. The Carleson operator The Carleson operator C is the non-linear operator defined by : Cf(x) = \\\\sup_N\\\\left|\\\\int_{-N}^N \\\\hat f(y)e^{2\\\\pi i xy} \\\\, dy\\\\rightIt is relatively easy to show that the Carleson-Hunt theorem follows from the boundedness of the Carleson operator from Lp(R) to itself for 1 < p < ‚àû. However, proving that it is bounded is difficult, and this was actually what Carleson proved.

Foster's Mill  Foster's Mill (also known as Foster Mills, Foster Mill and Spiller's Mill), off Station Road, was built of painted gault brick in 1898, designed by the architects Gelder and Kitchen of Hull..Station Road: Foster Mill, Cambridge 2000. It is one of the largest buildings in Cambridge, as well as being one of the few examples of large-scale industry in the city. The Foster family owned three mills in the city but the University of Cambridge prevented them from constructing railway lines to them, so they built this mill immediately next to the railway station. In 1917, Foster's Mill was sold to Pauls Agriculture and in 1947 it was sold to Spillers. Additions were made to the building in 1953. In 2000, it was owned by Rank Hovis. In 2001, it was announced that Rank Hovis would vacate the site eventually to enable redevelopment of the site. The Foster family also founded Fosters' Bank for use by their mill workers, with a site in Sidney Street in central Cambridge. The building (now a Lloyds Bank branch) was designed by the Victorian architect Alfred Waterhouse and built 1890‚Äì93.Sidney Street: Lloyds TSB Bank, Cambridge 2000. The name still exists over the doorway. The interior of the bank is vaulted and highly decorated with tiles, On 27 March 2010, during extensive demolition work on the mill, a major fire \\"accidentally\\" broke out which damaged the mill buildings causing their partial collapse.BBC News, 27 March 2010 The remaining section of the building will become 19 residential apartments as part of the CB1 development.Ceres CB1 Cambridge - Prestigious Modern Apartments for sale Cambridge  Demeter House  Demeter House Demeter House, on Station Road, was built in the 1960s. It is one of three similar office blocks, the others being 20 Station Road (formerly Leda House), and Jupiter House. The building is currently one of the principal offices for Mott MacDonald.  Railway station  The railway station opened in 1845 when the Eastern Counties Railway opened to Cambridge. The station building has a long classical fa√ßade and porte-coch√®re, which was infilled during the 20th century. It has been attributed to both Sancton Wood and Francis Thompson and is listed Grade II. The single very long platform is typical of its period but now unusual in that, apart from a brief period in the mid-19th century, it was never supplemented by another through platform. There were major platform lengthenings and remodellings of the main building in 1863 and 1908. The station layout was altered in 1896 through changes to the Newmarket line approaches.

Lowry, wirz.de. Retrieved 30 October 2016 is an American folklorist, writer, record producer, ethnomusicologist, historian, photographer, forensic musicologist, and teacher who deals with aspects of popular music, mainly African American. Born in Montclair, New Jersey, attending Deerfield Academy, and then Princeton University, where he specialized in the biological sciences. Teaching biology for a few years after obtaining a Master's in zoology, he changed his focus to blues and jazz with a primary focus on the Piedmont blues of the south- eastern United States. Ethnomusicological/folkloric field research Lowry traveled through the South Eastern United States for over a decade in the 1970s and 80's doing field recording and other research in the Piedmont region of Virginia, Georgia, and the Carolinas, including interviewing, photographing, and recording blues and gospel musicians between 1970 and 1980,Bastin, Bruce (1986/1995) Red River Blues: The Blues Tradition in the Southeast (Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press). , Google Books initially working in collaboration with British folklorist Bruce Bastin.Shepherd, John Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World, Volume 2 Continuum International Publishing Group, 2003 , at Google Books His field research also took him occasionally to the Midwestern US, where he recorded local Michigan pianists for the album Detroit After Hours - Vol. 1 and on to Chicago to record the blues albums Goin' Back Home (Homesick James) and I've Been Around (David \\"Honeyboy\\" Edwards). Trix Records In the early 1970s Lowry founded Trix Records, which proceeded to issue six 45s, and then 17 full-length LPs, from his hundreds of hours of field recordings. Trix artists included the stepson of Blues legend Robert Johnson, Robert Jr. Lockwood; Detroit and Macon, GA's Eddie Kirkland; Chicago's David \\"Honeyboy\\" Edwards; and New York-based Tarheel Slim. The then 92-year-old Edwards was the oldest musician to perform in Washington at the official celebration of the first inauguration of his country's first African American president, Edwards' neighbor, Barack Obama and received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2010. Trix Records remained active for two decades before the issued LP masters and company name were sold to Joe Fields of Muse Records, in New York. It was subsequently sold on to Joel Dorn and 32 Jazz/Blues, also in NYC, before ending with JVC's Savoy Jazz imprint. Lowry also produced albums for Atlantic Records (at the urging of Atlantic's founder Ahmet Ertegun), Muse Records, Savoy Records, Columbia Records, Biograph Records, Flyright Records, and other companies. He began writing about blues music for Blues Unlimited in the UK in 1964 when, at the Apollo Theatre in NYC, he became the first mainstream American journalist to interview and write about the young B.B. King in 1964.Blues Unlimited Magazine, issue #18, Nov/Dec 1964 Alan Lomax and Library of Congress After his decade of active fieldwork, Lowry worked with renowned ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax over two years at the Folklife Archives of the US Library of Congress on a project that later became \\"The Deep River of Song\\" series of CDs, a comprehensive collection of African American musics that was later commercially issued by Rounder Records in their \\"Alan Lomax Collection\\". The complete collection of Lowry's own field recorded material is copied and held in the permanent collection of the Library of Congress American Folklife Center Archive of Folk Culture. More recently, his tapes have been deposited with the Southern Folklife Collection in the Wilson Library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. It will be possible for interested members of the public to listen to any of them at either location for research purposes. Writings on music Lowry has been writing about African American music since 1964 beginning with Blues Unlimited in the UK. He has since written for Blues & Rhythm (UK), Cadence (US), Jazz Digest/HIP (US), Jazz Times (US), Juke Blues (UK), Living Blues (US), Penguin Eggs (CN), Rhythms (in Melbourne, Australia), Rolling Stone, The International Association of Jazz Record Collectors Journal (US), and Western Folklore (US), among others. His most recent series of articles in Blues & Rhythm magazine is called \\"The Stuff Was Still There - More Traveling & Recording The Blues\\". Along with an earlier series (\\"Oddenda & Such\\"), it tells the stories of his record label, Trix Records, the artists he located (and interviewed), recorded, and promoted along with the trials and tribulations of doing field research in the South East in the 1970s, plus the folly of owning and supporting a specialist blues music record label. Education and current endeavors A graduate of Princeton University, Lowry holds an MS from Rutgers University in Zoology and Serology, studied medicine at Columbia University and Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles and was a university lecturer in the biological sciences at SUNY New Paltz. Lowry later enrolled at The University of Pennsylvania in the PhD program in the Folklore Department, acquiring a master's degree and completing most of his doctoral studies (ABD). He has taught at a number of schools and universities as a visiting scholar and is currently working on a book on Piedmont Blues, entitled Truckin' My Blues Away: Piedmont Blues in Context, among other projects. These include more writings, as well as finally gathering his field recordings into possible album concepts; they number approximately fifty single-artist collections, with an additional twenty anthologies or \\"live\\" recordings. His first \\"field recordings\\" took place in 1966 at the Apollo Theatre in Harlem, of a show of blues. Lowry moved permanently to Australia in 1995, receiving Permanent Residency there as a scholar in the arts in 2000 for his unique expertise regarding American black musics. The tide moves on!

Adapted by Jeremy Brock from Rosemary Sutcliff's historical adventure novel The Eagle of the Ninth (1954), the film tells the story of a young Roman officer attempting to recover the lost Roman eagle standard of his father's legion in Scotland. The story is based on the Ninth Spanish Legion's supposed disappearance in Britain. Historically, the purported disappearance of the Ninth Legion in Northern Britain is a subject of debate and dispute. The film was a UK-US co-production. It was released in the United States on 11 February 2011, and in the United Kingdom on 25 March 2011. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $38 million against its $25 million budget. Plot In the year AD 140, twenty years after the Ninth Legion disappeared in the north of Britain, Marcus Flavius Aquila, a young Roman centurion, arrives in Roman Britain to serve at his first post as a garrison commander. Marcus's father, who was the Senior Centurion of the ninth, disappeared with the eagle standard of the ill-fated legion, and Marcus hopes to redeem his family's honour by bravely serving in Britain. Shortly afterwards, only Marcus's alertness and decisiveness save the garrison from being overrun by Celtic tribesmen in a local insurrection. He is decorated for his bravery but honourably discharged due to a severe leg injury. The Silchester eagle, found in Silchester, inspired the original The Eagle of the Ninth novel Living at his uncle's estate near Calleva (modern Silchester) in southern Britain, Marcus has to cope with his military career having been cut short and his father's name still being held in disrepute. Hearing rumours that the eagle standard has been seen in the north of Britain, Marcus decides to recover it. Despite the warnings of his uncle and his fellow Romans, who believe that no Roman can survive north of Hadrian's Wall, he travels north into the territory of the Picts, accompanied only by his slave, Esca. The son of a deceased chieftain of the Brigantes, Esca detests Rome and what it stands for, but considers himself bound to Marcus, who saved his life during an amphitheatre show. After several weeks of travelling through the northern wilderness, Esca and Marcus encounter Guern, a Roman-born Lucius Caius Metellus, one of the survivors of the Ninth Legion, who attributes his survival to the hospitality of the Selgovae tribe. Guern recalls that all but a small number of deserters were killed in an ambush by the northern tribes ‚Äì including Esca's Brigantes ‚Äì and that the eagle standard was taken away by the Seal People, the most vicious of the tribes. The two travel further north until they are found by the Seal People. Identifying himself as a chieftain's son fleeing Roman rule and claiming Marcus as his slave, Esca is welcomed by the tribe. After allowing the Seal People to mistreat Marcus, Esca eventually reveals that his actions were a ploy and helps his master to find the eagle. As they retrieve it, they are ambushed by several warriors, including the Seal prince's father, the chief of the tribe. Marcus and Esca manage to kill them. Prior to dying, the chief reveals that he killed Marcus's father, who apparently begged for his life. Furthermore, the chief is revealed to be wearing Marcus's father's ring. Marcus does not understand Celtic and asks Esca to translate, but Esca never reveals the fate of Marcus's father. With the aid of the Seal prince's young son, they escape from the village. The two flee south in an effort to reach Hadrian's Wall, with the Seal People in pursuit. Marcus, slowed by his old battle wound, orders Esca to take the eagle back to Roman territory and even grants the reluctant slave his freedom. Freed, Esca still refuses to abandon his friend and instead heads out to look for help. He returns with the survivors of the Ninth Legion just as the Seal People catch up with them. Guern reveals to Marcus that he saw Marcus's father die. He assures Marcus that his father was not a coward and fought to the end. The legionaries, wishing to redeem themselves, accept Aquila as their commander and prepare to defend the eagle standard. As an example to those who would betray their people, the Seal prince kills his young son in front of Esca, Marcus, and the legionaries. He then orders his warriors to attack. A battle ensues, in which all the Seal warriors are killed, along with most of the Ninth Legion soldiers, including Guern. Marcus kills the Seal prince by drowning him in the river. With the enemy defeated, the bodies of both Britons and Romans are laid out by the victors. As Marcus commends their valor, he lights a funeral pyre for Guern. As Guern is cremated, Marcus, Esca and the few survivors of the Ninth return to Roman territory, where Aquila delivers the eagle to the astonished governor in Londinium. There is some talk of the Ninth Legion being reformed with Marcus as its commander. But when Marcus and Esca wonder what they will do next, Marcus leaves the decision to Esca. Alternative ending An alternative ending is featured in the DVD. Marcus decides to burn the eagle standard on the altar where the final battle occurred, instead of delivering it to the Roman governor. He tells Esca that he does this because the eagle belongs to the men who fought for it. Marcus and Esca are then shown approaching Hadrian's Wall on foot and talking about their plans for the future.

Principal photography began on 24 August 2009 in Hungary, which doubles for what was later to become England. In October, production moved to Scotland, where filming took place in Wester Ross and at Loch Lomond, among other locations. The film was made for around ¬£15 million by producer Duncan Kenworthy's Toledo Productions for co-financiers Focus Features and Film4. Kevin Macdonald directed from a script by Jeremy Brock, who adapted the 1954 historical adventure novel of the same name by Rosemary Sutcliff. The director of photography was Anthony Dod Mantle, production design was by Michael Carlin, the costume design was by Michael O'Connor, and Justine Wright edited the film‚Äîher fifth for Macdonald. At the 62nd Cannes Film Festival in May 2009, The Eagle of the Ninth secured distribution deals \\"for every global market\\". Macdonald intended the film to be historically authentic, but as little is certain about the tribes that the Romans encountered‚Äîthey were generally Celtic peoples, though some may have been Picts‚Äîhe made concessions. For example, the tribespeople spoke Gaelic, even though the language probably did not enter widespread use in the region until the 5th century AD; Pictish is the more likely language to have been spoken at the time. \\"It's the best we can do,\\" Macdonald said. \\"All you can do is build on a few clues and trust your own instincts. That way, no one can tell you you were wrong.\\" Only 1% of Scots speak Gaelic, limiting the talent pool to just 60,000 people. By August 2009, several Gaelic-speaking boys had auditioned for the role of a boy of the Seal people, aged nine to twelve, but without success, so Macdonald held open auditions in Glasgow for the role. It was eventually given to nine-year-old Thomas Henry from New Barnsley, Belfast, who had been educated in Irish Gaelic. Macdonald described his view of the Seal people: > They were a more indigenous folk than the Celts, who were from farther south > ... They were probably small and dark, like the Inouit [sic], living off > seals and dressed in sealskins. We are going to create a culture about which > no one knows much, but which we will make as convincing as possible. We are > basing it on clues gained from places like Skara Brae and the Tomb of the > Eagles in Orkney, so that we will have them worshipping pagan symbols, like > the seal and the eagle. The reason they have seized the emblem of the Roman > eagle from the legion is because to them it [was] a sacred symbol. Achiltibuie, a village in northwest Scotland, was used as a filming location for the \\"Seal People\\". Filming started in Achiltibuie on 7 October 2009 and finished on 15 October 2009. The main location was Fox Point, Old Dornie. The Pictish village which was constructed at Fox Point was used on most days of the filming. Other sites included Achnahaird beach, where a horse chase was filmed, and Loch Lurgainn. Macdonald intended to use locals as extras. This was a success with many locals appearing as extras after going to castings in nearby Ullapool. Their roles included \\"Seal Warriors\\", \\"Seal Princesses\\" and \\"Elders\\". In a reversal of Hollywood films about the Roman Empire, Macdonald said the Romans are played by American actors and Rome's enemies by British actors, while the British actors Paul Ritter, Mark Strong and Pip Carter used American accents to play their Roman characters. The Romans are played by Americans \\"to achieve a little contemporary symbolism\\", with Bell using a neutral English accent. According to Channing Tatum, the actors trained 4‚Äì5 hours a day for each role. Although the film mostly stuck to the plot of Sutcliff's novel, there were a few modifications and condensations, e.g. it introduced a few violent scenes into what had been a novel written for younger children. Release Critical reception On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film holds approval rating of 40% based on 156 reviews, with an average rating of 5.35/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"The Eagle has a pleasantly traditional action-adventure appeal, but it's drowned out by Kevin Macdonald's stolid direction and Channing Tatum's uninspired work in the central role.\\"\\"The Eagle (2011)\\". rottentomatoes.com.

Sir Rory Mor's Horn is a drinking horn, one of several heirlooms of the MacLeods of Dunvegan, chiefs of Clan MacLeod. Clan custom is that each successive chief is to drink a full measure of the horn in wine to prove his manhood.MacLeod, F.T. 1912‚Äì1913: p. 115. The artwork on the horn has been dated to the 16th century, and by some as far back as the 10th century. The MacLeod chiefs have several other notable heirlooms kept at Dunvegan Castle‚Äîsuch as the Fairy Flag and the Dunvegan Cup (pictured right). Description and custom Sir Rory Mor's Horn is a drinking horn, made of an ox's horn, tipped in silver. The rim around the mouth of the horn is thick and on this there are imprinted seven medallions. On three of the medallions are beasts, on three others are patterns, and on the seventh and joining medallion is both a pattern and a beast. R. C. MacLeod considered the work to be Norse, and declared the horn to date from the 10th century. The horn holds about . Clan MacLeod custom is that each successive chief, on achieving the age of manhood, should drain, in one draught, the horn which is filled to the brim. The horn is named after Sir Ruairidh M√≤r MacLe√≤id (c. 1562‚Äì1626), the 15th chief of Clan MacLeod. There have been differing opinions concerning the age of the horn. In 1927, R. C. MacLeod declared his opinion that it dated from the 10th century. Professor Br√∂gger, from Oslo, thought it was of Norse origin, dating from the 10th century. Professor Callander, from Edinburgh, considered it to be not unfamiliar with other objects of Scotland, and dated it to the 16th century.MacLeod, R.C. 1927: pp. 40‚Äì41. In 1906, R. C. MacLeod noted that the greater proportion of the horn had been filled in, and that it was \\"but a moderate drink the present day Chiefs have to quaff. With what contempt, what might scorn would these stern warriors of the past look upon the puny performances of their descendants\\".MacLeod, R. C. 1906: pp. 46‚Äì47. In 1956, Elizabeth II and Prince Philip visited Dunvegan Castle. During this occasion, John, maternal grandson of the clan chief Dame Flora MacLeod of MacLeod, was challenged to quaff the horn which was filled with claret‚Äîwhich he did in one minute 57 seconds. Tradition crest badge contains the bull's head and the motto \\"hold fast\\". The Bannatyne manuscript, dates from about 1830 and is thought to have probably been written by Dr. William MacLeod Bannatyne. R. C. MacLeod noted that the manuscript contains a tradition concerning the origin of the horn. This tradition runs that one night, Malcolm (1296‚Äì1370), the 3rd chief of Clan Macleod, returned from a tryst with the Campbell wife of the chief of the Frasers who possessed the lands of Glenelg. That night Malcolm encountered a bull which lived in the woods of Glenelg and which had terrorised the local inhabitants. Armed with only a dirk, Malcolm slew the bull and broke off one of its horns. Malcolm carried off the horn to Dunvegan, as a trophy of his prowess. For this act of valour, Fraser's wife forsook her husband for Malcolm, thus starting a lengthy clan feud between the Frasers and the MacLeods. The tradition runs that ever since Malcolm's slaying the bull the horn has remained at Dunvegan; and was converted into a drinking horn, which each chief must drain to the bottom in one draught. The manuscript continues that ever since Malcolm defeated the bull, the family of MacLeod have used a bull's head as their heraldic crest, with the motto \\"hold fast\\".MacLeod, R. C. 1927: pp. 39‚Äì42. R.C. MacLeod noted another tradition concerning a bull and motto of the clan's chiefs (though not the drinking horn). The tradition runs that one day Tormod (c. 1509‚Äì1584), 12th chief of Clan MacLeod was being entertained by Argyll, chief of Clan Campbell, at Inveraray Castle. During his visit, the MacLeod chief learned that one of his clansmen was a convicted criminal who had condemned to be gored to death by a bull. The MacLeod chief appealed to Argyll, but the Campbell chief replied that it was too late and that nothing could save the MacLeod clansman. The MacLeod chief then sprang into the ring, armed with only his dirk, and attacked the bull. He grabbed hold of the bull's horns and cried out \\"hold fast!\\" and saved the clansman.MacLeod, R. C. 1927: pp. 107‚Äì108. The Skeabost Horn, which was the trophy awarded to the champions of the Southern League in the sport of shinty is based on the horn of Rory Mor. The Horn is no longer competed for but is in the possession of Jack Asher.

Boys (reportedly including Nutt's husband) had been very successful as telegraphy operators, but their attitude (lack of patience) and behavior (pranks and cursing) were unacceptable for live phone contact, so the company began hiring women operators instead. Thus, on September 1, 1878, Nutt was hired, starting a career that lasted between 33 and 37 years, ending with her retirement sometime between 1911 and 1915. A few hours after Nutt started working, her sister Stella became the world's second female telephone operator, also making the pair the first two sister telephone operators in history. Unlike her sister, Stella only remained on the job for a few years. The customer response to her soothing, cultured voice and patience was overwhelmingly positive, so boys were soon replaced by women. In 1879 these included Bessie Snow Balance, Emma Landon, Carrie Boldt, and Minnie Schumann, the first female operators in Michigan. Nutt was hired by Alexander Graham Bell, who is credited with inventing the first practical telephone; apparently she changed jobs from a local telegraph office. She was paid a salary of $10 per month for a 54-hour week. Reportedly, she could remember every number in the telephone directory of the New England Telephone Company. Commemoration This scene from \\"Bold Experiment ‚Äì the Telephone Story\\", depicts the first women operators, Emma and Stella Nutt, working alongside boy operators at the Edwin Holmes Telephone Despatch Co.

It was made from 1955 to 1958.Yamaha Motorcycle Design Page 1 of 8 This was also the first vehicle in Japan to have a primary kick start system (allowing the engine to be started with the transmission in gear). The Society of Automotive Engineers of Japan , includes the 1955 Yamaha 125YA-1 as one of their 240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology.  Background  Yamaha YA-1 at the Tokyo Motor Show in 2005 In the early-1950s, Yamaha had to replace its musical instrument factories as they were severely damaged during the war. Yamaha was also facing the industrial conversion of factory machine tools that had been used during the war for the production of fuel tanks, wing parts, and propellers for aircraft of the Imperial Japanese Navy, such as the Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter. As in European countries, the motorcycle had become a widespread means of transportation in Japan after World War II due to ease of production and economy of purchase and use. Japanese motorcycle production increased from 10,000 units in 1950 to 750,000 in 1954, with over 100 domestic manufacturers. Due to the strong expansion of the market, Yamaha Motor Co. decided to convert to the production of motorcycles, and found in the beginning the need to grapple with high specifications, for customers with elite, rather narrow needs, especially in view of the reduced number of production potential. The Red Dragonfly In January 1955, Nippon Gakki's (Japan Instrument) Hamana Factory in Hamakita was ready to begin production of the YA-1, and the first bikes were delivered to dealers in February. This new motorcycle had been heavily influenced by the contemporary DKW model RT125, and like the DKW was driven by a 125 cc two-stroke, single cylinder engine, but the YA-1 designers paid particular attention to materials, assembly, and engineering upgrades, such as going from a three-speed to a four-speed transmission. With confidence in the new direction that Genichi Kawakami was taking, Nippon Gakki founded Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd. on July 1, 1955 and made Kawakami the new company's first president. Staffed by 275 employees, the new motorcycle manufacturer built about 200 units per month by the end of 1955. That same year, Yamaha entered its new YA-1 in the two biggest race events in Japan. They were the 3rd Mt. Fuji Ascent Race held in July 1955, and the 1st Asama Highlands Race in November. In these debut races, Yamaha won the 125 cc class. The following year, the YA-1 won again in both the Light and Ultra- light classes of the Asama Highlands Race. The YA-1 soon established a reputation as a high-quality and reliable machine, which Japanese enthusiasts affectionately nicknamed the for its slender shape and elegant chestnut red finish. Outstanding race performance had made the YA-1 much more desirable, in spite of its price of ¬•138,000 in 1955 (for comparison, a male college graduate's starting salary was ¬•10,780 on average). Thanks to the popularity of the YA-1, a YB-1 model with a 4 cc larger displacement (allowing the engine to run slower) was produced later in 1955. A genuine successor to the YA-1, the 175 cc YC-1 was being produced by April 1956. Primary starting system The YA-1 was the first Japanese motorcycle to take advantage of a primary starting mechanism. Previously, motorcycles with a non-primary starting system used the transmission input shaft and clutch hub to connect the kick-start lever to crankshaft. It was thus necessary for the rider to first put the transmission into neutral, and then to engage the clutch before the starting the engine by pushing down on the kick-start lever. With its primary starting system, the YA-1 engine is equipped with a mechanism in which the primary driven gear is turned by means of a kick idling gear and kick pinion. This enables the rider to simply pull the clutch lever on the handlebar (i.e., disengage the clutch) and then to kick-start engine, regardless of whether the transmission is in neutral or in (any) gear. This mechanism is now the established kick start system for motorcycles worldwide. Yamaha Y125 Moegi concept bike Yamaha Y125 Moegi concept bike, 2011 Tokyo Motor Show The 2011 Tokyo Motor Show included a retrofuturistic concept motorcycle from Yamaha, designed along the lines of the 1955 YA-1. The Y125 Moegi is powered by an air-cooled 125cc single-cylinder engine (although this new engine is an SOHC four-stroke) sitting in an aluminum frame for a claimed weight of just , which makes the significantly lighter than the YA-1 was. The Moegi uses a low-maintenance belt final drive and rides on 20-inch wheels. The modified engine is based on the power plant of the YBR125 and Yamaha claims a fuel consumption of for the Y125 Moegi, making it efficient personal transportation in urban environments.

Kelly House is mid-18th century but its predecessor, the Tudor house, was on a different site nearby and is still in existence.Pevsner, N. (1952) South Devon.

This village was named Chelli in Old English (1166 A.D.), and Chenleie in the Anglo-Norman of the 1086 Domesday Book. Both these forms show mutation of the initial letter, again a feature of Celtic languages, where the initial letter 'mutates' when other words are place in front of it - in this case it would probably have originally been 'An Chelli' for 'the grove', where 'chelli' is the mutated form of 'Kelli', 'grove' in Old Cornish.

It is named for the nearby cave temple dedicated to Yoga Narasimha Perumal, at the foot of the Yanaimalai hills. This temple was constructed in 770 A.D. by Madurakavi alias Marankaari who was the minister of the Madurai King Parantaka Nedunjadaiyan . There is a front mandapam (court). The sculpture of Narasinga Perumal is carved out of the hill itself. The temple is a good example of the cave sculpturing of the Pandya Kingdom. In front of this there is a stone temple for the goddess Narasingavalli. This place, though not a Divyadesam sanctified by Azhwars' hymns, is situated between two holy places ‚Äî Alagar Koyil in the north and Thirumohur in the east.  Legend  According to the Sthala Purana for the Madurai Koodal Azhagar Temple, sage Romasa had installed the Narasimha idol in a cave in the hill. And the 87th chapter of the Uttara Kanda of the Brahmanda Purana says the sage did penance on the banks of the Padma Thadagam, as it was filled with lotus flowers, near the Gajagiri Kshetram (the present Anaimalai) seeking progeny, and wanted the Lord to appear in His Narasimha avatar. The Lord appeared as Ugra Narasimha and the heat that emanated from Him was unbearable. Even the celestials were affected by it and they all came to Gajagiri Kshetram and prayed to the Lord to calm down. The Lord could not be pacified and then they sought the help of Prahlada, whose arrival quietened Him to some extent. They prayed to the Goddess Mahalakshmi, who also took Her abode in Him as Narasingavalli, after which He became Yoga Narasimha. The Lord later granted the boon sought by the sage. According to another legend, Lord Siva was afflicted by Brahma Hathi Dosham (a curse that descends upon a Hindu if he murders a Vedic Brahman) after He plucked one of the five heads of Lord Brahma. He was relieved of it after He took a bath in the holy water source there, also known as Chakra Theertham, and He worshipped Lord Narasimha. It is believed that taking a dip in the Chakra Theertham, which is near the temple, rids one of all sins. Thiruvilayadal Purana The Thiruvilayadal Purana, written by Perumbatta Puliyur Nambi and later amended by Paranjothi Munivar, says that the Chola king, who could not win the battle against the Pandya ruler, sought the help of Jains. They created a giant elephant using their mystic powers and directed it to kill the Pandya king and destroy his capital. But the Pandya prayed to Lord Siva to save him and his capital. The Lord sent to him the \\"Narasinga Asthram\\" (the eight lettered word Namonarayana), which turned the elephant into a hill. To commemorate this event, a stone elephant was installed in Madurai near the Vaigai facing the north, which is found near the Yanaikkal bridge even today. Inscriptions in the cave temple say that Maran Kari, the minister of the Pandya king, started the construction of the temple in 770 A.D., which remained unfinished, either due to his death or due to some other calamity, and was completed by his brother Maran Eyinan later. He also built the Muka Mandapa and consecrated the temple. Architecture The fort around Azhagarkoil is also known as Iranyan Kottai, and even now a stone idol of Lord Yoga Narasimha is found atop its entrance. A big idol of Yoga Narasimha, found in the outer prakaram (closed precincts of a temple) of the Azhagarkoil temple, known as \\"Jwala Narasimhar\\", is said to be ferocious. To pacify Him, regular Thirumanjanam (a bathing ritual) is performed with gingelly oil. A hole is found in the ceiling above the idol which is believed to let out the fire emanating from it. The foot of the hill, where the Narasimha temple is located is known as Narasingam or Hasthigiri or Gajagiri. There one may find the Maha Mandapam, Garuda Mandapam and Mukha Mandapam of the Pandya period. The shrine of the Goddess Narasingavalli faces south, at the entrance. Inscriptions say that there was also an agraharam for Vedic Brahmins, but there is no trace of it now. The temple bustles with activity during the Narasimha Jayanthi festival, and on Masi Maham day, when Sri Kalamega Perumal of Thirumohur visits this place for the Gajendra Moksha festival. The temple is unique for its utsava idol of Narasimha in a standing posture with the Sudarsana and Panchajanya in His upper two hands while the left lower hand holds the Gathai (club weapon) and the right is in the Abhaya Hastha posture (blessing pose).  Inscriptions  The inscriptions at the temple are in ancient Tamil, Brahmi and Vattezhuthu. There are two inscriptions of Srivallabha Pandya (1101-1124 A.D.), which speak about the gifts made to the temple. There are also inscriptions of later Pandyas and one of them, belonging to the rule of Sundara Pandya, (1216-1238 A.D.) gives details about his conquest of the Chola country. Another inscription says that land gifts were made at Iyakkimangalam village for conducting the festival in the Anaimalai Temple. Later inscriptions are mostly incomplete. The Yoga Narasimha idol at the temple is six feet high, sculpted on the hill itself.

Vallarasu took the issue to Madras High Court, claiming that the nomination was invalid because the Representation of the People Act only permitted illiterates to file their papers in such a way. The court disagreed with Vallarasu, who had also challenged the manner in which the oath had been sworn by Ramachandran. Ramachandran won the seat, with Vallarasu finishing as runner-up.

He was the assistant deputy secretary for the Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools at the U.S. Department of Education from 2009 to 2011. Jennings holds degrees from Harvard University, Columbia University's Teachers College, and the Stern School of Business at New York University. He became a teacher and was named one of fifty \\"Terrific Teachers Making a Difference\\" by the Edward Calesa Foundation; he also came out as gay to his students. In 1990 he founded the Gay and Lesbian Independent School Teachers Education Network (later changed to the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network), which seeks to end discrimination, harassment, and bullying based on sexual orientation and gender identity. In 1992 he was named co-chair of the Education Committee of the Governor's Commission on Gay and Lesbian Youth in Massachusetts. Jennings has authored seven books, including one which won the Lambda Literary Award. Early life and teaching career Jennings was born in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He was the youngest of five children to Chester Henry, an itinerant Southern Baptist preacher, and Alice Verna (Johnson) Jennings. His family was poor and constantly moved around the South as his father sought a permanent post. His father died when Kevin was eight and the family was living in a Lewisville, North Carolina trailer park. From then on he grew up in a rural atmosphere that was intolerant of African Americans and gay people; several of his cousins and uncles were in the Ku Klux Klan. He was constantly taunted and bullied. \\"The first day of 10th grade I actually refused to go back to school because I simply wasn't going to go back to a place where I was bullied every day.\\" He attended Paisley Magnet School in Winston-Salem, North Carolina where he did well academically, but was beaten by classmates for what they saw as effeminate behavior and attempted suicide after realizing he was gay. After he and his mother moved to Hawaii he graduated from Radford High School in Honolulu. Jennings then attended and received a bachelor's degree magna cum laude in history from Harvard University, where he delivered the Harvard Oration at the 1985 commencement. He became a high school history teacher, first at Moses Brown School in Providence, Rhode Island, from 1985 to 1987, and then at Concord Academy in Concord, Massachusetts, from 1987 to 1995, where he was chair of the history department. In 1992 the Edward Calesa Foundation named Jennings one of fifty \\"Terrific Teachers Making a Difference\\". Most of his students accepted him when he revealed his sexual identity after years of keeping it secret. GLSEN and writing While at Concord Academy in 1988, Jennings started the nations' first gay-straight alliance together with a female student. Jennings then co- founded the Gay and Lesbian Independent School Teacher Network (GLISTeN) in Boston in 1990, to address the problems facing LGBT students. It held its first conference the following year, when it changed its name to the Gay and Lesbian School Teachers Network (GLSTN). The organization started out as a small local one but gained a strong supportive reaction. In 1992, Jennings was appointed by Governor William Weld to co-chair the Education Committee of the Governor's Commission on Gay and Lesbian Youth. He was the principal author of, \\"Making Schools Safe for Gay & Lesbian Youth\\", a commission report. The Massachusetts State Board of Education adopted the report as policy in May 1993 and the state became the first in the U.S. to outlaw discrimination of public school students on the basis of sexual orientation in December 1993. In 1993, Jennings was named a Joseph Klingenstein Fellow at Columbia University's Teachers College, from which he received his master's degree in interdisciplinary studies in education in 1994. In 1994 he wrote Becoming Visible: A Reader in Gay & Lesbian History for High School and College Students, the \\"first book of its kind\\" for a high school audience. Jennings moved GLSTN to New York to accompany his studying, and decided to make the organization national in scope. In doing so, he also changed its name to the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN), to give it a broader focus. The organization seeks to end discrimination, harassment, and bullying based on sexual orientation and gender identity. In both 1995 and 1996 Jennings was in Out magazine's list of \\"Top 100 Newsmakers and Earthshakers\\". In 1997, Newsweek magazine named Jennings to its \\"Century Club\\" of people likely to make a difference in the 21st century. Jennings earned an M.B.A. from New York University's Stern School of Business in 1999. By that year, GLSEN was headquartered in the Chelsea, Manhattan neighborhood of New York City and had a staff of 18 and budget of $2.5 million. In 1998 he won the Lambda Literary Award in the Children's/Young Adult category for his book Telling Tales Out of School. He has published six books on gay rights and education. His works have described his own past as a closeted gay student. In July 2004, Jennings received the National Education Association (NEA)'s Virginia Uribe Award for Creative Leadership in Human Rights. NEA Republican Educators Caucus chairwoman Diane Lenning protested the award because‚Äîby her reading of a story in Jennings' book One Teacher in 10‚Äîshe thought he broke Massachusetts law in 1988 by not reporting a sixteen-year-old gay high school student's relationship with an older man. Three days later, the caucus ousted Lenning as chairwoman over her stance against gays, and later that month The Washington Times published a letter from Jennings saying the accusations were hurtful, inaccurate and potentially libelous. CNN subsequently confirmed that the student was above the age of consent in Massachusetts and not sexually active. The incident resurfaced in 2009 as part of a social conservatives' campaign against Jennings' appointment to head the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools, as well as a conference sponsored by GLSEN with the Massachusetts Department of Education in 2000 where instructors were fired for promoting the practice of fisting to underage youth.\\"Wash. Times continues its relentless campaign against Jennings\\", Justin Berrier. Media Matter for America. December 9, 2009. Retrieved 6 feb 2017 Jennings is a lifelong, avid ice hockey fan, who has played in the New York City Gay Hockey Association. In 2005, he suffered a near-fatal heart attack after a game, but he recovered and returned to the ice in 2007. In 2008, Jennings spoke out against the practice of homophobic chants from fans at New York Rangers home games, and stopped his practice of regularly attending their games for about a month. Jennings and the director of the Gay Hockey Association met with officials of the Rangers and Madison Square Garden but failed to get much action from them. Jennings was a founding member of the Advisory Board for You Can Play, a campaign dedicated to fighting homophobia in sports. Jennings stepped down as head of GLSEN as of August 2008. By then, GLSEN had two regional offices and a staff of 40, and there were gay-straight alliances in over 3,700 schools registered to GLSEN. Office of Safe and Drug Free Schools On May 19, 2009, Obama administration Secretary of Education Arne Duncan announced Jennings' appointment as an Assistant Deputy Secretary for the Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools, starting July 6, 2009 as the third director of the office, which was established in 2002 during the George W. Bush administration pursuant to the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act part of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. Social conservatives campaigned against Jennings' appointment because they alleged he condoned child molestation based on the 2004 incident over a teen's story he related in his book One teacher in 10 : LGBT educators share their stories.Chris Good, Kevin Jennings: The Latest Embattled Appointee, The Atlantic, October 9, 2009. The allegations were proven to be false when it was shown the student was above the age of consent and no sex had occurred. 53 Republican members of the House of Representatives signed a letter to the Obama administration that called for Jennings' dismissal. Education Secretary Duncan, the White House, the NEA, and the National Association of Secondary School Principals have supported Jennings' appointment, with Duncan saying Jennings was \\"uniquely qualified for his job.\\" As Assistant Deputy Secretary, Jennings focused on matters relating to student safety, classroom discipline and bullying.Dana Rudolph, Fed to schools: Law requires actions against bullying, San Diego Gay & Lesbian News, October 26, 2010. His office has awarded safety grants worth millions of dollars. Jennings specifically led the development of the Safe and Supportive Schools program, which utilized student survey data to analyze school safety and direct grants to those schools identified by students as facing the biggest challenges. In August 2010 his office hosted the first-ever National Bullying Summit, which he and his Research and Policy Coordinator for Bullying Prevention Initiatives, Deborah Temkin, organized.SPECIAL REPORT: Growing Up Gay , WJBF- TV News, November 15, 2010.Sally Holland, School bullying takes center stage at summit in Washington , CNN, August 11, 2010. In September 2010 Jennings became one of the notable members of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention (NAASP), a public-private partnership designed to advance and update the 2001 National Strategy for Suicide Prevention and an outgrowth of the Suicide Prevention Resource Center.Dana Rudolph, HHS awards up to $22.4 million for suicide prevention, Keen News Service, November 11, 2010.

On May 19, 2011, the Boston-based nonprofit organization Be the Change, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, announced that Jennings would be resigning his position with the Obama administration and on July 25 he would become President and Chief Executive Officer of the organization. Jennings was praised for his perseverance and effectiveness in the face of early criticism.https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/08/kevin-jennings- obama-anti-bullying-czar/ Current work Lambda Legal's Board of Directors announced it has named Kevin Jennings as the organization's new CEO, following a five-year stint as executive director of the Arcus Foundation, a philanthropic foundation advancing social justice and conservation issues, which he joined after leading Be the Change for a year and helping launch its Opportunity Nation campaign. From 2008 to 2013, Jennings served as board chair for the Tectonic Theater Project, creators of The Laramie Project. Jennings also served on the board of the Harvard Alumni Association from 2008 to 2014, becoming only its second openly gay elected director in 2008.http://harvardmagazine.com/2008/07/and-the-winners-are-.html He founded First Generation Harvard Alumni, an alumni association of graduates who were the first in their families to attend college which offers mentorship and other support and advocacy services for current first-generation students at Harvard.http://harvardmagazine.com/2012/09/first-generation-challenges From 2009 to 2015, Jennings served on the board of Union Theological Seminary, where he chaired the Development Committee and served on the Executive Committee. Since 2015, he has been the founding board chair for the Ubunye Challenge, which uses extreme athletic events to raise funds to build schools in southern Africa. Honors and awards Jennings received the Distinguished Service to American Education Award of the National Association of Secondary School Principals in 2007. He also received the Diversity Leadership Award of the National Association of Independent Schools in 2008. In 2010 Jennings was elected by his classmates to be Chief Marshal of the 2010 Harvard Commencement.http://harvardmagazine.com/2010/07/commencement-confetti Jennings also was honored by another of his alma maters, Columbia University's Teachers College, with its Distinguished Alumni Award in 2012. Maintaining his family's historic ties to Appalachia, Jennings served from 2004 to 2009 as national fundraising chair for the Appalachian Community Fund, which honored him with its Appalachian Hero Award in 2012.

She was registered in Hamilton, Bermuda during her 7-year ocean racing campaign and her sail number is KB-80. She is not to be confused with her predecessor Condor of Bermuda (KB-78) (aka. Heath's Condor-K-707), also owned and campaigned by Bob Bell.  Construction and materials  Condor was revolutionary both for having the largest (tallest) single spar mast in the world (at the time of her launch) and for being the largest of all the IOR Maxi fleet at that time. (Ongoing IOR rule changes allowed each new yacht to be slightly bigger than ones built under previous versions of the rating rules). She was built from kevlar and composite structures, with an Alloy space frame inside. She was the second yacht of this type to be built where the hull itself could support the enormous loads generated by the huge mast and rig. Unlike her predecessor, Condor of Bermuda, which was built of wood yet had (the world's first) carbon fibre rig, Condor's mast was aluminium. It was about 18% taller than her 'sistership's' mast (due to the additional loading permitted by the space frame) and heavy 8 cylinder 8LXB Gardner diesel engine, turning a 42 inch folding propeller, despite her hull being only 3 feet longer overall. Both Condor and Condor of Bermuda were eventually installed with Gardner 8LXB reserve engines, due to their reliability, and overall mass, which was a key consideration in IOR ratings at the time. In 1993, the Gardener was replaced with a Perkins 6354 diesel. In 2007 she was fitted with a smaller Yanmar 4LHA which was replaced again in 2017 with the same model. Today she runs a 26\\" three bladed Hydralign feathering propellor. Condor was designed by New Zealand boat designer Ron Holland. History Condor was a maxi yacht campaigning on the IOR Maxi Circuit from 1981 to approximately 1987. In 1987, she was sold to Australian Grazier Tony Paola, where she continued to race for a time under the name Condor of Currabubula until she was retired from racing, and now resides in Airlie Beach, on the Great Barrier Reef, chartering for overnight sailing adventures with several of her contemporaries for her present owners, ProSail. She still races today in Airlie Beach Race Week and Hamilton Island Race Week each year where individuals can charter a spot on board to compete in this annual events. She returned to racing in 2008. Condors Sail wardrobe for most of its racing years was made by Hood Sails in Sydney. Ian Broad from Hood sailed extensively on the boat during the 1980s and has been making the charter sails for the boat since its arrival in the Whitsundays. During the 1990s several North sails were made for the boat. Notable features and events * Being built from kevlar composite (a development from aluminium construction), with a space frame supporting a hollow hull (no internal reinforcement bulkheads) and the tension/compression loads of the mast and sails. * Winning every major yacht race twice. * Being the first private western vessel to sail (authorised) up the Yangtsee river since the beginning of communist rule in China. * Running aground in the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race, and being awarded victory (line honours) by protest, over American Nirvana. * Snapping her titanium rudder in the 1984 Sydney to Hobart. * Being fired upon by pirates in the Caribbean. Victories * The Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race 1983, 1986. * The Newport Bermuda Race (1986). This race was won with a spectacular lead of over 5 hours over the next maxi, Then Navigator Jon Barret, successfully negotiated an Eddy on the Gulfstream's southwestern side as the entire fleet had chosen a more northeastern route, allowing Condor to strike victory with such a considerable margin. * The Miami to Montego Bay Race (1983 & 86) * Hamilton Island Race Week (1990 & 2010) * The Fastnet Race 1981, 1983? * The California Cup 1982 * The Pan Pac Cup - Hawaii 19?? * The Maxi World Series 198?, 198?.

On Monday, 1 June 2015   HornetQ Apache donation and Apache Artemis 1.0.0 release  The HornetQ code base was donated to the Apache ActiveMQ community late last year and now resides as a sub project under the ActiveMQ umbrella named Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. Since the code donation, the developers have been working tirelessly to get an initial release of Artemis out the door; to allow folks to give it a whirl and to finalise the donation process. With the release of Apache Artemis 1.0.0, that process has come to a close and the code donation has now been completed. The active developer community has migrated across to Artemis; all of the developers that were active on HornetQ are now committers to the Artemis project; working on the code base as part of the ActiveMQ umbrella. The hope is that the union of the two great communities HornetQ and ActiveMQ will provide a path for a next generation of message broker with more advanced features, better performance and greater stability. The community hopes to achieve these goals using the Artemis core with its superior performance in combination with the vast feature offering of ActiveMQ. The Artemis project is targeted to house this next generation of message broker, as such any new feature requests or contributions from the HornetQ community should now be placed into the Artemis stream of development. HornetQ will be mostly in maintenance only mode, aside of fixing bugs of its active branches (2.3 and 2.4). The HornetQ could easily migrate to Artemis 1.0.0 as Artemis is already compatible with HornetQ clients; it supports a number of other protocols such as AMQP, Stomp, ActiveMQ's native messaging protocol 'OpenWire' (at Alpha with support for ActiveMQ JMS clients and basic transport) and also JMS 2. In addition the team started development on support for MQTT.  Features  It has the following relevant features: * Supports STOMP and now AMQP 1.0http://docs.jboss.org/hornetq/2.4.0.Final/docs/user- manual/html/interoperability.html#d0e14318 protocols for cross-language clients * 100% JMS compliant * 8.2 Million Messages per second with SpecJMS * AIO (over Linux)/NIO (over any OS) based high performance journal. * Clustering for scalability and reliability * Supports Master/Slave architecture for fault tolerance * Supports discovery groups for dynamic node clusters * Core Bridges to connect to other HornetQ servers (over unreliable WAN links) * JMS Bridges to connect to other JMS compatible servers * Diverts to reroute traffic without modifying application code * Paging to support messages whose size exceeds the available RAM * Large message support to enable file messaging * XA and JTA transaction support * Application Server integration using the JCA standard (allows MDBs too) * High performance Netty NIO connector over TCP, SSL and Servlet modes (for messaging between firewalls) * JMX based management * Last Value Queues (for protocols that support these) * Filters and wildcard support * Security features integrated with JAAS * Simple XML configuration References External links * Simple client for HornetQ by Jruby * HornetQ web site * SPECjms2007 results * HornetQ Open Hub project page Category:Message-oriented middleware ","title":"HornetQ"},{"id":"24106080","text":"Constantine, Algeria. Mechta-Afalou (Mechtoid) or Paleo-Berber are a population that inhabited parts of North Africa during the late Paleolithic and Mesolithic. They are associated with the Iberomaurusian archaeological culture. Mechtoids are believed to have been assimilated during the Neolithic and early Bronze Age by the makers of the ensuing Capsian culture. Craniometric analysis indicates that these Iberomaurusians were closely related to the early Holocene Capsians of the Maghreb (Tamazgha), as well as the early Holocene Kiffians of the Sahara. Iberomaurusian fossils excavated at the Afalou site were found to carry the mtDNA haplogroups H or U (3/9; 33%), J (2/9; 22%), H103 (1/9; 11%), H14b1 or JT (1/9; 11%), R0a1a (1/9; 11%), and T2b (1/9; 11%). All of these are Eurasian Haplogroups. Iberomaurusian fossils excavated at the Ifri N'Ammar site were found to carry the Y-DNA haplogroups E-M35*(1/2; 50%) and E-L19*(1/2; 50%). All individuals carried the mtDNA haplogroup U6. Iberomaurusian fossils excavated at the Taforalt site were found to carry the Y-DNA haplogroups E-M78*(4/6; 66%), E-L618*(1/6; 16%), and E-M215*(1/6; 16%). All individuals carried the mtDNA haplogroups U6(6/7; 85%) and M1(1/7; 14%). Loosdrecht et al. (2018) analysed genome-wide data from seven ancient individuals from the Iberomaurusian Grotte des Pigeons site near Taforalt in north-eastern Morocco. The fossils were directly dated to between 15,100 and 13,900 calibrated years before present. The scientists found that all males belonged to haplogroup E1b1b, common among Afroasiatic males. The male specimens with sufficient nuclear DNA preservation belonged to the paternal haplogroup E1b1b1a1 (M78), with one skeleton bearing the E1b1b1a1b1 parent lineage to E-V13, one male specimen belonged to E1b1b (M215*). These Y-DNA clades 24,000https://yfull.com/tree/E-M35/ years BP had a common ancestor with the Berbers and the E1b1b1b (M123) subhaplogroup that has been observed in skeletal remains belonging to the Epipaleolithic Natufian and Pre- Pottery Neolithic cultures of the Levant. Maternally, the Taforalt remains bore the U6a and M1b mtDNA haplogroups, which are common among modern Afroasiatic-speaking populations in Africa. A two-way admixture scenario using Natufian and modern sub-Saharan samples (including West Africans and the Tanzanian Hadza) as reference populations inferred that the seven Taforalt individuals are best modeled genetically as of 63.5% Natufian-related and 36.5% sub-Saharan ancestry (with the latter having both West African-like and Hadza-like affinities), with no apparent gene flow from the Epigravettian culture of Paleolithic southern Europe. The scientists indicated that further ancient DNA testing at other Iberomaurusian archaeological sites would be necessary to determine whether the Taforalt samples were representative of the broader Iberomaurusian gene pool.

The distribution is restricted to an area around Wongan Hills, where it is found on gravelly loam in open shrubland. The flowers are white or creamy, becoming pink, and without a scent. Description Hakea chromatropa is a non lignotuberous bushy shrub to tall and wide with finely fissured bark. Small branches are covered with short forked matted hairs and longer simple hairs. Mid-green leaves are rigid, egg-shaped long and wide narrowing toward the stem. The edge of the leaf has definite \\"teeth\\" widening toward the apex, 1‚Äì5 teeth or entire terminating with a stiff sharp point on each margin. The inflorescence appear in leaf axils with a barely discernible stalk. Each flower having a stalk long, covered in long soft white hairs. The bracts surrounding the flower heads are egg-shaped, very concave with flat longish hairs up to long. Each inflorescence has 20-26 unscented creamy-white flowers turning a deep pink with age. Fruit are broadly egg-shaped more enlarged on the lower side long and wide. The surface is covered with small corky pyramid- shaped protrusions. The flowering period is between July and the beginning of October. Taxonomy and naming Hakea chromatropa was first formally described in 2007 by Alex George and Robyn Mary Barker and published in Nuytsia. 17:159-164. The specific epithet (chromatropa) is derived from the Ancient Greek words chroma meaning \\"colour\\" and trope \\"a turn\\" or \\"a turning\\" referring to the species habit of flowers changing colour as they age. The new taxon was described by Alex George and Robyn Barker from dried specimens obtained in 2006 and recorded as having no scent. However in a television interview, Alex George stated that Hakea chromatropa \\"has a lovely scent like vanilla\\". Distribution and habitat Hakea chromatropa has a restricted distribution in four localities in the northern Jarrah Forest and north- western Avon Wheatbelt. Grows in open shrubland with sparse mallee and wandoo eucalyptus woodland on gravelly loam. The new taxon was described from flowering specimens obtained in 2006. Conservation status Hakea chromatropa is listed as \\"Priority One\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations which are potentially at risk.

He was born in the Danish city of Odense. His career as a public figure started in 1942, when he, together with seven other young Danes, founded the resistance group Churchill Klubben (The Churchill Club). After the war, he worked briefly as a newspaper reporter, attended law school, and worked for a film company before devoting his life to art. Knud Pederson was a resistance fighter during World War II. Angered that the Danish government had let the Nazis invade without the Danish army putting up a fight, he and a group of Danish teenage boys started the Churchill Club, named after the British leader Winston Churchill. The Churchill Club sabotaged cars, train stations and stole many weapons and explosives from the Nazis. Knud was arrested and tried for sabotage, stealing, destruction of property, and other offences. He was arrested and put in prison for two years. The first year he was in a city prison, called King Hans Gades Jail and then was moved to Nyborg State Prison. Before his release on May 27, 1944, he took his university test. He proved that a saboteur could become a judge in Denmark. He did not know what to do after that. The resistance refused him, since the Nazis were watching him, and he could easily be identified on covert missions. Eventually, he joined K company, division B, group number 4. They moved weapons caches from place to place to avoid German detection. Post-war activities After many a sabotage actions and 2 years in prison, Pedersen turned to the arts, partly as an artist, but mainly as an organizer. Before he became a saboteur, he loved painting. His father supported him so much that he opened an account for him at a local art store, allowing him to buy any supplies that he desired. His dream was to make art available to everyone, and to this end, he launched several projects. In 1943 he got permission from the authorities to set up Byens billede, the Picture of the City, an empty frame in which paintings could be exhibited. In 1945 he founded his Kunstbibliotek, or Art Library, an art rental space where people could rent a painting for the price of a packet of cigarettes. Both projects still exist: passers-by will meet the Picture of the City on Nikolaj Kirke plads in Copenhagen. As a young bohemian in Copenhagen in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Pedersen got to know a great many local artists. Among them was Arthur K√∂pcke or K√∏pcke, a German national who had emigrated to Denmark in 1958. K√∏pcke ran a small gallery, Galerie K√∏pcke, that showed some of the most advanced art in Europe at that time. Besides works by local artists he exhibited works by Piero Manzoni, Christian Megert, Diter Rot, Robert Filliou, Niki de Saint Phalle and Daniel Spoerri. Via Rot, Filliou and Spoerri he also came into contact with George Maciunas, the man who invented the name Fluxus. He offered to organize a Fluxus concert in Copenhagen, and Maciunas agreed. By that time, K√∏pcke had had to leave his old gallery space and had been given shelter by Pedersen at Nikolaj Kirke, the old desanctified church in the center of Copenhagen where the Art Library was located. It was only natural that Pedersen should take an interest, and the result was that the first series of Fluxus concerts ever to be held in Denmark ‚Äì the second series of concerts in the history of Fluxus ‚Äì took place at Nikolaj Kirke from 23 until 28 November 1962. Pedersen enjoyed the experience and continued to organize Fluxus concerts at the Art Library. The concerts in November 1962 brought together a group of four, consisting of Pedersen, K√∏pcke and two young Danish composers called Eric Andersen and Henning Christiansen, that enlivened Danish art life with numerous Fluxus performances in 1963 and 1964, many of them organized by Pedersen. Pedersen, however, always continued working with other artists, besides the ones that were associated with Fluxus. In 1964, he made an agreement with the Tuborg brewery, to the effect that works of art could be displayed on the sides of beer vans as they drove their delivery rounds through the country. At the Art Library, he installed a jukebox with works of sound art, and offered to rent jukeboxes to every institution that was interested. In 1968, he opened a savings account at a special interest rate at the Danish Bikuben bank and deposited 100 Danish crowns. In 285 years the 100 crowns would grow to 659 billion crowns; enough money to finance three projects by Fluxus artists Eric Andersen, George Brecht, and Arthur K√∏pcke. However, from being an organizer, Pedersen developed to become an artist as well. This development is only natural, since so much Fluxus art is about creating a framework within which the art can develop. In retrospect, even his earliest projects, such as the Picture of the City, can be seen as a kind of work of art. In 1967, he opened the Copenhagen Museum of Modern Art, a virtual museum where he is still the director, receiving daily invitations and publications from other museums. In connection with the ‚ÄúFluxshoe‚Äù exhibition that toured England during the early 1970s, he organized a ‚Äútwo-ball football match‚Äù at University College Sports Ground in Oxford. In 1992, in connection with a festival called ‚ÄúExcellent 1992‚Äù, he created the Good Buy Supermarket, a one-day sale of art multiples at a regular supermarket. And on the same occasion, he organized ‚ÄúThree Star √† la Carte‚Äù, where Fluxus pieces were served in a restaurant setting. A new realization of the piece could be experienced at the Baltic Centre in Gateshead on 15 February 2009, in connection with the exhibition ‚ÄúGeorge Maciunas. The Dream of Fluxus‚Äù. However, the projects mentioned above represent only a fraction of Pedersen‚Äôs total production. Apart from having run the Art Library for a lifetime, he is a prolific writer and initiator of many projects. He founded a film school in Ebeltoft, founded Netbogklubben, the NetBook Club, for the sale of digital books, and much more. During the 1960s, 70s, and 80s he was an active participant in the mail art network, exchanging works of art with hundreds of artists around the globe. Today, these works, together with a great number of Fluxus works and related documents, make up the bulk of the Knud Pedersen Fluxus Archive, located at Kunsthallen Nikolaj in Copenhagen. However, the name ‚Äòarchive‚Äô is misleading: rather than a systematic collection of material, the ‚Äòarchive‚Äô is the witness of a long life spent making and distributing art. As Pedersen himself has said: ‚ÄúI do not collect, I just never throw anything away‚Äù. He died at the age of 88 on 18 December 2014.  Trial and Arrest  On May 6 1942, Knud and the other members of the club were each brought to on office questioned. They were trying to lie their way out of this but failed. They were trying to conceal the truth but the other members were twisting the stories too much and giving much information. The questioning lasted till 2 a.m. After questioning, he was sent to the King Hans Gades Jail. Pedersen once stated \\"It will be a long time before I slept as a free man again.\\" A few hours later, he and the other Churchill Club members were sent to court. There was an argument about who was going to host the trial, Denmark or Germany. If Germany were to host the trial, the boys would be executed. If Denmark were to host the trial, they might have a 4 year sentence. In the end, Denmark hosted the trial under a few conditions: That the headmaster will be removed from the School and banished from √Öalborg (Aalborg). Second, the Germans made it clear that during the trial that a German observer would be inside the courtroom at all times, watching carefully and reporting to Berlin.

After the armistice he began playing rugby for his home town club, Aspatria RUFC. He received the first of his 36 Cumberland county caps playing against Cheshire in 1920. In 1921, he played fullback for the North in their annual game against the South. In 1923, he received the first of his seven international caps, playing against Scotland and France. In the same year he captained Aspatria when they defeated Silloth RFC to regain the Cumberland county cup. In 1924, he went on the British Lions' tour to South Africa but suffered a broken collar bone in the opening game and took no further part in the series.

In 1924, he captained Cumberland when they won the County Championship, for the first and only time in their history, defeating Kent by six points to three in the final at Carlisle. He continued to captain the county side until 1926, when he accepted one of many offers to play Rugby league, signing professional forms for Oldham. In 1927, Oldham beat Swinton by 26 points to 7, in the first BBC broadcast Rugby League Challenge Cup final. Tosh scored three tries and became only the third man in the history of the final to achieve that recognition. F. W. (Basher) Ashworth, another native of Aspatria also played in that final. In 1996, Robbie Paul also joined that elite grouping, playing for Bradford Bulls when they defeated St. Helens. Tosh also gained an international cap for England playing against Wales in 1928. He retired from the game in 1931, when he returned to Aspatria to run a shop selling drapery and ironmongery.West Cumberland Times 2 October 1946 He died at Aspatria on 19 July 1969. The eldest brother Jonathon (Jont) was a highly respected three-quarter back, won the first of his 32 county caps at the age of seventeen. He was a member of the Aspatria side that won the county cup in 1909, 1911 & 1912, and beaten finalists in 1908 and 1910. Perhaps his greatest achievement came in 1913, when he played in the county side narrowly beaten by Gloucestershire in the final of the county championship. On 18 November 1916, two individual telegrams arrived at the family home, regarding the disappearance of both Jont and his younger brother Alex, reports later substantiated. Rugby union Holliday played at fullback for Aspatria RUFC. He also captained Cumberland in the English County Championship, against Kent in 1924. He later played for , on 17 March 1923 against at Inverleith. He was capped a further six times between then and 1926. The following year, he went on the 1924 British Lions tour to South Africa, but was injured in the first match, and so was unable to play in the rest of the tour. He was not the only 1924 British Lion to defect to rugby league, Roy Kinnear also did so. Rugby league At club level, he played for Oldham.

Prosthodontics is the dental specialty that focuses on dental prostheses. Such prostheses are used to rehabilitate mastication (chewing), improve aesthetics, and aid speech. A dental prosthesis may be held in place by connecting to teeth or dental implants, by suction, or by being held passively by surrounding muscles. Like other types of prostheses, they can either be fixed permanently or removable; fixed prosthodontics and removable dentures are made in many variations. Permanently fixed dental prostheses use dental adhesive or screws, to attach to teeth or dental implants. Removal prostheses may use friction against parallel hard surfaces and undercuts of adjacent teeth or dental implants, suction using the mucous retention (with or without aid from denture adhesives), and by exploiting the surrounding muscles and anatomical contours of the jaw to passively hold in place.

He studied in the Greek and Bulgarian schools in his town and also in the Bulgarian Pedagogical School in Serres, where he finished two years of schooling. In 1899 he became a teacher of the Bulgarian Exarchate in the village of Igumenets, Petrich region. He entered the revolutionary organisation IMARO in 1900. At first, he was a member of the revolutionary band of Kostadin Zelnikov. In November 1900 he met Gotse Delchev in the village of Monospitovo. Anastasov accompanied Delchev during his tours in Eastern Macedonia. He worked as a revolutionary agitator in the regions of Petrich, Poroy (Poroia), Demir Hisar and Strumica. He was a fighter in the bands of Mihail Poroyliyata and Iliya Karchovaliyata as well as a secretary in the band of Georgi Radev. He escaped to Bulgaria for nine months and afterwards he again entered Macedonia and joined the band of Gotse Delchev. During the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising he led a group of fighters in the region of Drama, which was destroyed in a battle near the village of Kalapot (today Panorama). He then again escaped to Bulgaria, where the biographer Lyubomir Miletich recorded his memoirs. At the beginning of 1904, he headed to the region of Drama with a band of 14 fighters, but he was ambushed on the Bulgarian-Turkish border and was killed together with all other members of the band.

In 2013, the position of Director was handed over to William Harnden, a former volunteer with the charity. , more than 500 volunteers had worked on projects with KHT, teaching English or installing clean water systems. The trust's income was just over ¬£360,000 in 2015. Objectives The Karen are the largest hill tribe in northern Thailand, numbering around 400,000. The trust's projects all take place within Mae Hong Son Province, the poorest province in Thailand. The trust operates a small office in the town of Khun Yuam and co-ordinates administrative and fundraising activity from York, UK. The trust aims to \\"see the Karen people empowered to help themselves in a sustainable way\\" by focusing on: * Improving health by installing clean water systems and latrines. * Increasing access to education by providing school buses, meals, dormitories and scholarships. * Securing better livelihoods by building irrigation systems and regenerating land. Activities , the trust claims to have helped improve the lives of more than 200,000 people since its inception by funding projects and sending volunteers from the UK and elsewhere to assist Karen communities in Mae Hong Son province. Since 1999, volunteers sent by the trust have helped local construction workers install water systems to provide clean water to 50,000 people and reduce levels of typhoid. Around 30,000 blankets and 40,000 mosquito nets have been distributed in the same period to guard against cold temperatures and malaria. The trust funds 23 school buses, giving over 700 children access to secondary school, and a school meals programme funds rice for over 400 school children. A dormitory was built for the secondary school in Mae La Luang, and some students have vocational or higher education funded by the trust. Since 2008, the trust has worked with Karen farmers to irrigate 5,600 rai of farmland, estimated to benefit at least 60,000 people.

During the Mycenaean period, Thessaly was known as Aeolia, a name that continued to be used for one of the major tribes of Greece, the Aeolians, and their dialect of Greek, Aeolic. Geography At its greatest extent, ancient Thessaly was a wide area stretching from Mount Olympus to the north to the Spercheios Valley to the south. Thessaly is a geographically diverse region, consisting of broad central plains surrounded by mountains. The plains are bounded by the Pindos Mountains to the west, Mount Othrys to the south, the Pelion and Ossa ranges to the east, and Mount Olympos to the North. The central plains consist of two basins, the Larisa basin and the Karditsa basin, drained by the Pineios River into the Vale of Tempe. The Pagasetic Gulf in southeastern Thessaly was and is the only body of water suitable for harbours in region. Strictly speaking, Thessaly refers primarily to the central plains inhabited by the Thessalians in antiquity. The plains were divided in antiquity into four administrative regions called tetrads: Pelasgiotis, Phthiotis, Thessaliotis, and Histiaeotis. In its broader sense, Thessaly also included the surrounding regions called the perioikoi, which were regions inhabited by different ethnic groups that were closely tied to the Thessalians either as subordinates, dependents, or allies. The perioikoi were composed of Perrhaibia, Magnesia, Achaea Phthiotis, Dolopia, Ainis, Malis, and Oitaia. The three largest cities in Thessaly were Larisa (Pelasgiotis), Pherai (Pelasgiotis), and Pharsalos (Phthiotis). The Thessalian plains were ideally suited for cultivating grains and cereals, and were known in antiquity for horse-rearing. Alexander the Great's horse, Bucephalus, was originally from Pharsalos. The surrounding mountainous regions, however, were less suitable for agriculture and relied more heavily on pastoralism. History Thessaly was home to extensive Neolithic and Chalcolithic cultures around 6000 BC‚Äì2500 BC (see Cardium pottery, Dimini and Sesklo). Mycenaean settlements have also been discovered in Thessaly unearthing, at the Kastron of Palaia Hill, in Volos, tablets bearing Mycenaean Greek inscriptions, written in Linear B. In mythology, Thessaly was homeland of the heroes Achilles and Jason, as well of mythological creatures and peoples, Centaurs, Lapiths, Phlegyans and Myrmidons. Ancient tribes in Thessaly mentioned by Homer or other poets were: Aeolians, Magnetes, Perrhaebi and Pelasgians. The name of Thessaly recorded epigraphically in Aeolic variants .Derived from tessares/pettares \\"four\\", from a division into four parts (Thessalian tetrarchy; Phthiotis, Thessaliotis, Histiaeotis and Pelasgiotis), according to G.

Thessalian grave stela of a man dressed as a hunter The Thessalians were a Thesprotian tribe (according to Herodotus, vii. 176; Veil. Pat. i. 3), and originally came from the Thesprotian Ephyra. Under the guidance of leaders, who are said to have been descendants of Heracles, they invaded the western part of the country afterwards called Thessaly, and drove out or reduced to the condition of Penestae, or bondsmen, the ancient Aeolian inhabitants. Afterwards, the Thessalians spread over the other parts of the country, taking possession of the most fertile districts and compelling the Peraebi, Magnetes, Achaean Phthiotians and other neighbouring people to submit to their authority and to pay them tribute.Thucyd. ii. 101, iv. 78, viii. 3,; Aristot. Pol. ii. 6. Like Laconia, the population of Thessaly therefore consisted of three distinct classes: # The Penestae, whose condition was nearly the same as that of the Helots. # The subject people, who inhabited the districts not occupied by the Thessalian invaders. They paid tribute, as stated above, but were personally free, though they had no share in the government. They corresponded to the Perioeci of Laconia, by which name they are called by Xenophon.Hell. vi. 1. ¬ß 19. # The Thessalian conquerors, who alone had any share in the public administration, and whose lands were cultivated by the Penestae. For some time after the conquest, Thessaly seems to have been governed by kings of the race of Heracleidae, who may however have been only the heads of the great aristocratic families, invested with the supreme power for a certain time. Under one of these princes, named Aleuas, the country was divided into four districts ‚Äì Phthiotis, Plistiaeotis, Thessaliotis and Pelasgiotis:Aristot. ap. Harpocrat. s. v. Tetrarchy: Strab. ix. p. 430. This division continued throughout Thessalian history, and it may therefore be concluded that it was not merely a nominal one. Each district may have regulated its affairs by some kind of provincial council, but we are almost entirely in the dark concerning the internal government of each district.Thirlwall, Hist, of Greece, vol. i. p. 437. When occasion required, a chief magistrate was elected under the name of tagus, whose commands were obeyed by all four districts. He is sometimes called king (basileus, Herod, v. 63), and sometimes archon (Dionys. v. 74.) He levied soldiers from the states in each district, and seems to have fixed the amount of tribute to be paid by the allies. (Xenoph. Hell. vi. 1. ¬ß 19.) When Jason of Pherae was tagus, he had an army of more than 8,000 cavalry and not less than 20,000 hoplites (Xenoph../. c.), and Jason himself says that when Thessaly is under a tagus, there is an army of 6,000 cavalry and 10,000 hoplites.Id. vi. 1. ¬ß 8, The tribute Jason levied from the subject towns was the same as had been previously paid by one of the Scopadae family, whom Buttmann supposes to be the same Scopas as the one mentioned by Aelian ( V. H. xii. 1) as a contemporary of Cyrus the younger. When Thessaly was not united under the government of a tagus, the subject towns possessed more independence. (Xenoph. Hell. vi. 1. ¬ß 9.) In later times, some states called their ordinary magistrates tagoi (Bockh, Corp. Liscr. n. 1770), which may have been done however, as Hermann suggests, only out of affectation. However, Thessaly was hardly ever united under one government. The different cities administered their own affairs independently of one another, though the smaller towns seem to have frequently \\"been under the influence of the more important ones (Xenoph. Hell. vi. 1. ¬ß 8). In almost all the cities, the form of government was aristocratical (\\"dynastic rule rather than isonomy\\", according to Thucyd. iv. 78), and it was chiefly in the hands of a few great families, who were descended from the ancient kings. Thus Larissa was subject to the Aleuadae, whence Herodotus (vii. 6) calls them kings of Thessaly ; Cranon or Crannon to the Scopadae, and Pharsalus to the Creondae. (Compare Theocr. xvi. -34, &c.;) These nobles had vast estates cultivated by the Penestae; they were celebrated for their hospitality and lived in a princely manner (\\"hospitable, magnificent, the Thessalian way\\" Xenoph. Hell. vi. 1. ¬ß 3), and they attracted to their courts many of the poets and artists of southern Greece. However, the Thessalian commonality did not submit quietly to the exclusive rule of the nobles. Contests between the two classes seem to have arisen early, and the conjecture of Thirlwall (vol. i. p. 438), that the election of a tagus, like that of a Roman dictator, was sometimes used as an expedient for keeping the commonalty under, appears very probable. At Larissa, the Aleuadae made some concessions to the popular party. Aristotle (Pol. v. 5) speaks, though we do not know at what time he refers to, of certain magistrates at Larissa, who bore the name of politophylakes and exercised a superintendence over the admission of freemen, and were elected themselves out of the body of the people whence they were led to court the people in a way unfavourable to the interests of the aristocracy. There were also other magistrates at Larissa of a democratic kind, called Larissopoioi. (Aristot. Pol. iii. 1.) Besides the contests between the oligarchical and democratical parties, there were feuds among the oligarchs themselves; and such was the state of parties at Larissa under the government of the Aleuadae two generations before the Persian wars, that a magistrate was chosen by mutual consent, perhaps from the commonalty, to mediate between the parties (archon mesidios, Aristot. Pol. v. 5). At Pharsalus too at the close of the Peloponnesian War, the state was torn asunder by internecine commotions and, for the sake of quiet and security, the citizens entrusted the acropolis and the whole direction of the government to Polydamas of Pharsalus, who discharged his trust with the strictest integrity. (Xenoph. Hell. vi. 1. ¬ß 2, 3.) silver hemidrachm of Thessalian League struck 470‚Äì460 BC In the summer of 480 BC, during the Second Persian invasion of Greece, the Persians invaded Thessaly. The Greek army that guarded the Vale of Tempe, evacuated the road before the enemy arrived. Not much later, Thessaly surrendered and the Aleuadae joined the Persians. (See Thorax of Larissa, Thargelia (hetaera)) However, the power of the aristocratical families seems to have continued with little diminution until towards the close of the Peloponnesian War, when decidedly democratic movements first begin to appear. At this time, the Aleuadae and the Scopadae had lost much of their ancient influence. Pherae and Pharsalus then became the two leading states in Thessaly. At Pherae, a tyranny, probably arising from a democracy, was established by Lycophron, who opposed the great aristocratical families and aimed at the dominion of all Thessaly. (Xenoph. Hell. ii. 3. ¬ß 4 ; ^Diod. xiv. 82.) The latter object was accomplished by Jason of Pherae, the successor, and probably the son, of Lycophron, who effected an alliance with Polydamas of Pharsalus and caused himself to be elected tagus about in 374 BC. While he lived, the whole of Thessaly was united as one political power but, after his murder in 370 BC, his family was torn asunder by internecine discords and did not maintain its dominion for long. The office of tagus became a tyranny under his successors, Polydorus, Polyphron, Alexander, Tisiphonus, and Lycophron; until, at length, the old aristocratical families called in the assistance of Philip II of Macedon, who deprived Lycophron of his power in 353 BC, and restored the ancient government in the different towns. At Pherae, he is said to have restored popular, or at least republican, government.(Diod. xvi. 38.) The Thessalian people elected Philip archon tagus of the Thessalian League for life; a few years later (344 BC), he re-established the tetrarchies (or tetradarchie), installing governors devoted to his interests and who were probably members of the ancient noble families. (Demosthen. Philip, ii. p. 71, iii. p. 117; Harpocrat. s. v.). The Thessalian cavalry became also part of the Macedonian army and many Thessalians took part in the campaign of Alexander the Great. At the close of the First Macedonian War, 197 BC, under Flamininus, it was declared free along with Orestis;Liv. xxxiii. 34, xxxiv. 51, Polyb. xviii. 30. but ultimately it was incorporated in the Roman province of Macedonia along with Epirus vetus.

The understandability of information is based on common ontology models common data formats. Another key idea is that Smart-M3 is device, domain, and vendor independent. It is free to use, open-source solution available in BSD license.

This M3 issue means that many kinds of devices shall interact with each other, for instance a mobile phone, a television set and a laptop. A device may be composed of parts that are considered as individual partners for interaction with another device. For instance, a user makes use of the keyboard of a desktop computer for typing input to a mobile phone. Further, the user shall be free in choosing the manufacturer. Any piece of software engaging this M3 issue must at least be able to work properly in an environment constrained by these issues. Moreover, the Smart-M3 technology allows to build pieces of software that are able to take advantage of the opportunities such an environment offers.Oliver Ian, T√∂rma Seppo, Nuutila Esko (2009). ‚ÄúContext Gathering in Meetings: Business Processes Meet Agents and The Semantic Web‚Äù. Presented at TCoB 2009Jantunen Joni, Boldyrev Sergey, Oliver Ian, Honkola Jukka (2009). ‚ÄùAgent/Space-Based Computing and Radio Frequency Memory Tag Interaction‚Äù. Presented at IWERT 2009 When humans make use of the Web, they produce and consume human readable information and exchange this information based on the paradigm of 'persistently publish and actually read'. A piece of software executing in a device used by humans may transform, render, analyze and index that human readable information, but this software will not understand the information.Web Architecture from 50,000 feet. W3C Also the technology of the Smart-M3 approach does not make such human-human communication machine-understandable. Instead, Smart-M3 follows the principle of the Semantic Web that machine-understandable information has to be prepared explicitly for software reasoning.Berners-Lee Tim, James Hendler, Ora Lassila (2001). \\"The Semantic Web\\". Scientific American. However, instead of specifying explicitly the means of interaction between a piece of software producing data and sending it across the internet to a piece of software consuming that data, Smart-M3 follows exactly the human-human interaction paradigm of 'persistently publish and actually read' also when software interacts with software across the internet. While the notion of the Semantic Web embodies the vision of a single, universal web of machine-understandable information, Smart-M3 organizes the machine-machine communication by setting up in the Web many distinct spots of information exchange. At each spot a number of pieces of software executing in potentially many devices of potentially many kinds may publish and read information. This information has been prepared not only explicitly in machine readable form but also explicitly for each particular spot. Any particular spot of information exchange has a particular purpose or focus. All information that a particular spot of information exchange makes available will be dedicated to the particular purpose or focus of that spot. The number of pieces of software exchanging information at a particular spot is consequently limited to those that share this dedication. At the core of the M3 issue is the issue of interoperability. The Smart-M3 approach deviates direct point-to-point interoperability because it applies the 'publish and read' mechanism at dedicated spots of information exchange in the Web. The publishing entity does not need to be interoperable with the reading entity. In fact the two even do not need to know about each other. Instead, Smart-M3 simply takes means that the publisher is able to publish at the selected spot of information exchange and the reader is able to read there.  System decomposition  Figure 1 shows a top view of a single system based on the software technology of the Smart-M3 approach. At the heart of the system is the corpus-M3 which decomposes further into a semantic information broker (SIB) and the real physical storage of data. Of course, this corpus-M3 must be hosted by a device. A number of devices hosts many M3-agents, including optionally the device already hosting the corpus-M3. Figure 1: System decomposition The SIB is the access point for receiving information to be stored or retrieving such stored information. In the data storage all this information is stored as a graph that conforms to the rules of the Resource Description Framework (RDF). A M3-agent is a piece of software that has been produced and deployed for the purpose of communicating with a SIB and publishing or reading information there. A particular M3-agent is in range of a particular SIB if this M3-agent physically is able to communicate with this SIB by using one of the potentially many communication means this SIB is capable of and this M3-agent has been produced and deployed explicitly for publishing or reading information at this SIB. A particular M3-agent is associated with a particular SIB if this M3-agent is in range of this particular SIB and this M3-agent has been accepted by this SIB for publishing or reading information due to a positive result of some negotiation performed when this M3-agent made the initial communication attempt. Various domains and application areas involve devices of many kinds and these devices may have different communication capabilities. To achieve interoperability in such an heterogeneous situation, the SIB supports multiple transport mechanisms, such as TCP/IP, HTTP, Bluetooth and NoTA.NoTA World Open Architecture Initiative Depending on the actual operating environment the most suitable transport technology is selected.  Notion of application  Applications are not constructed in the monolithic manner but rather from collaborating - through information sharing - sets of agents (M3-agents). Said set of agents depends upon the particular situation and context that the user is either experiencing or requires at that time. Agents may by provide a monolithic style user- interface but this is purely a user-interface and not functionality concept. The programming model is analogous to that of the actor model.Ian Oliver (2012) Apps Considered Harmful The Smart-M3 approach envisions computing beyond the traditional monolithic application program.Ian Oliver (2008) Sedvice: Triple-Space Computing Exploration Platform. Tripcom Workshop. Galway, Ireland Instead, scenarios are considered in which a set of M3-agents executing in various devices mash-up the information that these M3-agents store and retrieve in/from a particular SIB. This collaboration of M3-agents forms the application. Which collaboration and mash-up of information occurs depends on the data available and is not even known a priori.Soininen Juha- Pekka, Lappetel√§inen Antti (2009). ‚ÄùM3 Smart Environment Infrastructure‚Äù. NoTA 2009 Conference . Based on the data available within a space, a Smart-M3 system allows maintenance of an up-to-date digital representation of an environment covered by a set of devices executing M3-agents. If any information about the surrounding environment is easily available, an unlimited number of mash-up scenarios can be imagined that benefit from this information.Cinotti Tullio Salmon, Bartolini Sara, D‚ÄôElia Alfredo, Roffia Luca, Spadini Federico, Trevisan Riccardo, Vergari Fabio, Zamagni Guido (2009). ‚ÄúApproaching the design of interoperable smart environments applications‚Äù.

Main research topics are information search and access control in distributed smart spaces. PhD thesis work and several master's degree works are in progress. Development activities include CoffeeBreak Assistant application, which intended to provide information support, communication and expert- finding services during conferences and other events. The project SmartSlog in the wireless and mobile technology laboratory of Petrozavodsk State University (Petrozavodsk, Russia) develops an ANSI C ontology library generator. It maps a Web Ontology Language (OWL) description to ANSI C code (ontology library). The library provides API for programming M3-agents in high-level terms of ontology entities instead of low-level triplet-based terms. The ontology library is between an agent application and a low-level (mediator) library.

They have created a body of work encompassing four feature-length live filmscores, five short live filmscores, have released 4 CDs, and have embarked on 15 international tours, performing at festivals on all 5 continents, the highlights being seasons at The New Victory Theater on Broadway, The Edinburgh Festival, Lyric Theatre in London, the Sydney Opera House, and festival appearances in Ireland, China, South Africa, Brazil, Korea, Germany, the Netherlands and New Zealand. After a 4-month tour across the US and Canada in 2003 the band were beginning to experience touring fatigue and only performed sparingly over the next 4 years, playing once a year at festivals such as Sydney's Rocks Aroma Coffee Festival in 2004 and 2005 and the Singapore Arts Festival in 2006. A turning point for the band came in 2007 when they were commissioned by the Victorian Arts Centre to create a new score for the 1922 Chinese silent film Labourer's Love, which toured to Beijing and Shanghai as part of the Australian Theatre Festival. They found themselves reinvigorated by success of this project, as well as the following Australian performances at the Westgarth Film Festival and 2007-2008 Woodford Folk Festival, and the company have resumed their career as an ongoing venture. In 2009 the band obtained funding from the Victorian Arts Centre's Full Tilt fund to develop a new score to Buster Keaton's classic 1926 film The General and commenced 4 weeks paid rehearsal as artists-in-residence at the Arts Centre in July/August.

Function and genomic context Ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) encodes for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) that constitutes the majority of the ribosome. These genes are not constitutively expressed and a mechanism of gene silencing is put in place to suppress rDNA gene expression when the ribosome isn‚Äôt required. Gene silencing of rDNA requires binding of the chromatin remodelling complex, NoRC to a non-coding RNA (ncRNA) molecule that is complementary to the rDNA promoter. The ncRNA that is involved in rDNA silencing is known as pRNA and has been shown to originate from a spacer promoter located upstream of the pre-ribosomal RNA transcription start site. Once this ncRNA is transcribed it is processed to form a 150‚Äì250 nucleotide long RNA molecule and overlaps the rDNA promoter region. Computational analysis of pRNA predicted that pRNA forms a conserved stem loop structure and is shown to be conserved across a number eukaryotes. Research Several studies have shown that pRNA is vital in the recruitment and localization of the chromatin remodelling complex which is needed for gene silencing. EMSA supports the idea that pRNA is involved in heterochromatin formation as it showed that pRNA from a number of different species interacted with TIP5, the large subunit of the chromatin remodelling complex NoRC. Mutagenesis of pRNA showed that RNA secondary structure is vital for TIP5 binding as mutations that altered secondary structure prevented TIP5 binding. TIP5 binds to pRNA by an induced fit mechanism as TIP5 showed a greater sensitivity to protease digestion in the presence of pRNA. This conformational change may allow TIP5 to interact with other proteins that are required for NoRC function but this needs to be confirmed by further studies. Not only does pRNA stimulate NoRC formation but knock down studies and mutagenesis of pRNA showed that pRNA has a role in NoRC localization. Knock down of pRNA showed NoRC to translocate from the nucleoli to the nucleoplasm and on restoring pRNA levels NoRC translocated back into the nucleoli. Mutating pRNA also showed that its sequence and secondary structure are crucial for NoRC localization as altering the structure of sequence prevented NoRC translocation to the nucleoli. These studies confirmed that pRNA has a role gene silencing by targeting chromatin remodelling complex to a rDNA gene promoters where both pRNA sequence and structure are crucial for its function.

During the existence of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Peroviƒá was a secretary general of the League of Communists of Serbia in period between 1968‚àí1972. In 1972 Federal League of Communists of Yugoslavia dismissed her from her position together with Marko Nikeziƒá i Mirko Tepavac under the accusation that they are excessively liberal. Dismissal of Serbian \\"liberals\\" in 1972 followed an earlier dismissal of supposed Croatian \\"nationalists\\" of Croatian Spring. Following her removal from active politics Latinka Peroviƒá focused on scientific work at the Institute for the History of the Labor Movement of Serbia (modern day Institute for Recent History of Serbia). During the 1990s Breakup of Yugoslavia and Yugoslav Wars Latinka Peroviƒá was one of the sharpest critics of Serbian nationalism, especially Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá and his regime. Biography She was born in Kragujevac, Serbia in 1933. She graduated in history at the University of Belgrade and earned a PhD degree in political science 1975 at the same University. At the age of 27, she was already president of the Conference for the Women's Social Activity of Yugoslavia (1960-1964). Peroviƒá was Secretary of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Serbia from 1968 to 1972. She was considered the most influential woman in Serbia at that time and the only one who did not gain her position based on marriage with a more powerful man than herself, but rather through her own intelligence, competence and ambition. In 1972 Marko Nikeziƒá (the president of the CC of the LCS) and Peroviƒá were removed from their positions because Josip Broz Tito considered their views too liberal. After that, she never returned to politics. Peroviƒá devoted herself to historical research and became known as one of the most prominent experts on Serbian history from the 19th century onwards. From 1976 to 1998 Peroviƒá worked at the Institute for Recent History of Serbia. In her writings and studies on modern Serbia, she often emphasizes that Serbia needs a politician who would publicly claim responsibility for the destruction wrought in the former Yugoslavia in order to help the reconciliation with the neighboring states and prevent the recurrence of this kind of tragedy. She was opposed to the regime of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. Being the founder of modern liberalism in Serbia, some claim Peroviƒá is also political guru to ƒåedomir Jovanoviƒá, president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in Serbia. Since 1993 Peroviƒá has been an editor in chief of Currents of History magazine. She rarely appears in public or gives interviews. Selected works 2010 book \\"Facts and Interpretations. Two Conversations with Latinka Perovic\\" included detailed bibliography of Latinka Peroviƒá with the list of 8 monographs, 10 historical source-books with introductory studies on 19th century, 9 historical source-books with introductory studies on 20th and 21st century, 18 forewords and postscripts, 78 studies, discussions and articles and 13 noticed reviews. Bibliography did not include articles, interviews, and speeches on book promotions, which have been published in various newspapers and magazines as well as obituaries. Peroviƒá continued writing in the following years. Her 2015 book \\"Dominantna i ne≈æeljena elita\\" () initiated critical response from Croatian Sociologist Mira Bogdanoviƒá who in her 2016 book \\"Elitistiƒçki pasijans: Povijesni revizionizam Latinke Peroviƒá\\" () criticized Peroviƒá for inventing concepts of dominant and unwanted elites which do not exist in Sociological science.

The hypothesis suggests that endurance running played an important role for early hominins in obtaining food. Researchers have proposed that endurance running began as an adaptation for scavenging and later for persistence hunting. Anatomical and physiological adaptations Running vs. walking Much research has been geared towards the mechanics of how bipedal walking has evolved in the genus Homo. However, little research has been conducted to examine how the specific adaptations for running emerged, and how they influenced human evolution. The bit of research that has focused on human running provides much evidence for bodily function and structures that improve running only, and are not used in walking. This suggests that running was an adaptation, not that it came about as a byproduct of walking. Running and walking incorporated different biomechanisms. Walking requires an \\"inverted pendulum\\" where the body's center of mass is shifted over the extended leg, to exchange potential and kinetic energy with each step. Running involves a \\"mass spring\\" mechanism to exchange potential and kinetic energy, with the use of tendons and ligaments. Tendons and ligaments are elastic tissues that store energy. They are stretched and then release energy as they recoil. This mass spring mechanism becomes less energetically costly at faster speeds and is therefore more efficient than the inverted pendulum of walking mechanics when traveling at greater speeds. Tendons and ligaments, however, do not provide these benefits in walking. Although the mass spring mechanism can be more energetically favorable at higher speeds, it also results in an increase in ground reaction forces and is less stable because there is more movement and pitching of the limbs and core of the body. Ground forces and body pitching movement is less of an issue in the walking gait, where the position of the body's center of mass varies less, making walking an inherently more stable gait. In response to the destabilization of the running gait, the human body appears to have evolved adaptations to increase stabilization, as well as for the mass-spring mechanism in general. These adaptations, described below, are all evidence for selection for endurance running. Skeletal evidence Many researchers compare the skeletal structures of early hominins such as Australopithecus to those of Homo in order to identify structural differences that may be significant to endurance running. Nuchal ligament: Because the head is decoupled from the shoulders, early Homo needed a way to stabilize the head. The nuchal ligament is an important evolved feature in head stabilization. It starts at the midline of the occiput and connects to the upper trapezius. This ligament is also important in terms of archaeological findings, because it leaves a small indentation and ridge in the skull, allowing researchers to see if various species had a nuchal ligament. The ability to see traces of ligaments in archaeological findings is rare because they degrade quickly and often leave no trace. In the case of the nuchal ligament, a trace of its existence is left with the presence of the skull ridge. Because neither Australopithecus nor Pan had the skull ridge, it has been concluded that this feature is unique to Homo. Because the nuchal ligament is only activated while running, the amount of running can be inferred from the rugosity of the muscle insertions. In the case of Homo Erectus and Neanderthals, very strong nuchal ligament markings are present, but are less marked in modern humans, indicating a decrease in running behavior. Nuchal ligament of Homo sapiens Shoulder and head stabilization: The human skeleton is different from early hominins as there is less of a connection between the pectoral girdle parts of the shoulders and upper back and head, which would be advantageous for climbing but would hinder the movements of the upper body needed to counter leg movement and therefore stabilize the body and head when running. This stabilization is unnecessary in walking. Limb length and mass: Homo has longer legs relative to body mass, which helps to decrease the energetic costs of running, as time in contact with the ground increases. There is also a decrease in mass of distal parts of limbs of humans, which is known to decrease metabolic costs in endurance running, but has little effect on walking. Additionally, the mass of the upper body limbs in Homo has decreased considerably, relative to total body mass, which is important to reduce the effort of stabilizing the arms in running. Joint surface: Humans have evolved to absorb great shock and force on the skeletal structure while running. The impact force on the body can reach up to 3‚Äì4 times body weight in endurance running, putting the skeletal structure under great stress. To reduce this stress humans have increased joint surfaces relative to body mass to spread force over larger surface areas, particularly in the lower body. This adaptation, which allows humans to absorb great shock and force applied to the skeleton, is not seen in australopithecine skeletal structures. Plantar arch: The plantar arch in the human foot has an elastic spring function that generates energy for running but not walking. Fossils of the australopithecine foot show only partial arch, suggesting less of a spring capacity. For the plantar arch spring mechanism to function fully, there must also be restricted rotation in the hind and front parts of the foot. This restriction comes from projected toe bone and compacted mid-foot joint structures in humans, which does not become present until Homo habilis. Calcaneal tuber and Achilles tendon: Studies have explored the calcaneal tuber, the posterior half of the calcaneus bone, as a correlate for Achilles tendon length and have found correlation between calcaneal tuber length and Achilles tendon length. Because shorter calcaneal tuber length leads to greater Achilles stretch, more kinetic energy is converted to elastic energy, translating into better overall running economy. Comparisons between Neanderthals and modern humans reveal that this adaptation was absent in Neanderthals, leading researchers to conclude that endurance running capabilities may have been enhanced in anatomically modern humans. File:Calcaneus anatomy.jpg|Calcaneus Shorter toes: Human toes are straight and extremely short in relation to body size compared to other animals. In running, the toes support 50 to 75% of body mass in humans. Impulse and mechanical work increase in humans as toe length increases, showing that it is energetically favorable to have shorter toes. The costs of shorter toes are decreased gripping capabilities and power output. However, the efficiency benefits seem to outweigh these costs, as the toes of A. afarensis remains were shorter than great apes, but 40% longer than modern humans, meaning that there is a trend toward shorter toes as the primate species moves away from tree-dwelling. This 40% increase in toe length would theoretically induce a flexor impulse 2.5 times that of modern humans, which would require twice as much mechanical work to stabilize. Stabilization Semicircular canal: The semicircular canal, a series of three interconnected tubes within each ear, is important for sensing angular rotations of the head and thus plays a crucial role in maintaining balance and sensing and coordinating movement. Comparative studies have shown that animals with larger semicircular canals are able to sense a greater range of head movements and therefore have greater speed and agility. Evolutionarily, greatly reduced semicircular canal diameters are evident in Neanderthals but expanded in modern humans, suggesting that this adaptation was selected for in response to increased endurance running. Vestibulo-ocular reflexes (VORs): VORs are enabled by muscles in the eye, which sense angular accelerations of the head and adjust eye movements to stabilize these images. This was an important adaptation for running because it allowed Homo to see more clearly during the rough pitching motion that occurs during running. Gluteals: The gluteus maximus in Homo erectus is significantly larger than that of Australopithecus. It is suited to absorb and return force, much like a spring, as the body oscillates vertically with each step. Gluteals of that size and strength are not necessary for walking. Iliac spine: Homo has expanded areas on the sacrum and posterior iliac spine for greater muscle attachment. These areas are used to stabilize the trunk and reduce the body's forward pitch caused by running strides. Increased efficiency  Thermoregulation  In addition to advances in skeletal structure and stabilization, adaptations that led to increased efficiency in dissipation of heat were instrumental in the evolution of endurance running in Homo. The duration for which an animal can run is determined by its capacity to release more heat than is produced to avoid lethal temperatures. The majority of mammals, including humans, rely on evaporative cooling to maintain body temperature. Most medium-to-large mammals rely on panting, while humans rely on sweating, to dissipate heat. Advantages of panting include cooler skin surface, little salt loss, and heat loss by forced convection instead of reliance on wind or other means of convection. On the other hand, sweating is advantageous in that evaporation occurs over a much larger surface area (the skin), and it is independent of respiration, thus is a much more flexible mode of cooling during intense activity such as running. Because human sweat glands are under a higher level of neuronal control than those of other species, they allow for the excretion of more sweat per unit surface area than any other species. Heat dissipation of later hominins was also enhanced by the reduction in body hair. By ridding themselves of an insulating fur coat, running humans are better able to dissipate the heat generated by exercise. In addition to improved thermoregulation, hominins have evolved an enhanced method of respiration consistent with the demands of running. Due to their orientation, respiration in quadrupedal mammals is affected by skeletal and muscular stresses generated through the motion of running. The bones and muscles of the chest cavity are not only responsible for shock absorption, but are also subjected to continuous compression and expansion during the running cycle. Because of this movement, quadrupeds are restricted to one breath per locomotor cycle, and thus must coordinate their running gait and respiration rate. This tight coordination then translates into another restriction: a specific running speed that is most energetically favorable. The upright orientation of bipedal hominins, however, frees them from this respiration- gait restriction. Because their chest cavities are not directly compressed or involved in the motion of running, hominins are able to vary their breathing patterns with gait. This flexibility in respiration rate and running gait contributes to hominins having a broader range of energetically favorable running speeds.  Storage and utilization of energy  During periods of prolonged exercise, animals are dependent on a combination of two sources of fuel: glycogen stored in the muscles and liver, and fat. Because glycogen is more easily oxidized than fat, it is depleted first. However, over longer periods of time, energy demands require that fat stores be utilized as fuel. This is true for all mammals, but hominins, and later modern humans, have an advantage of being able to alter their diet to meet these prolonged energy demands. In addition to flexibility in the utilization of energy, hominins have evolved larger thyroid and adrenal glands which enable them to utilize the energy in carbohydrates and fatty acids more readily and efficiently. These organs are responsible for releasing hormones including epinephrine, norepinephrine, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), glucagon, and thyroxine. Larger glands allows for greater production of these key hormones and ultimately, maximized utilization of stored fuel. Taken together, the flexibility in diet and the enhanced usage of fuel heightens the previously mentioned finding that, unlike quadrupeds, hominins do not have a single energetically optimal running speed. For quadrupeds, increasing running speed means increasing the demand for oxygen and fuel. Due to skeletal structure and bipedalism, hominins are free to run energetically over a broader range of speeds and gaits, while maintaining a constant energy consumption rate of approximately 4.1 MJ per 15 km. Thus their utilization of energy is greatly enhanced. Endurance running and scavenging All of the aforementioned adaptations enabled Homo to scavenge for food more effectively. Endurance running could have been used as a means of gaining access to distant carcasses or food stores faster than other scavengers and/or carnivores. Scavenging may have taken one or both of two forms: opportunistic scavenging and strategic scavenging. Early Homo almost certainly scavenged opportunistically. Scavenging is considered opportunistic when one \\"come[s] across carcasses in the course of [their] daily foraging activities\\". Strategic scavenging involves a planned search for carcasses. This style of scavenging would have benefitted from endurance running much more than opportunistic scavenging. Strategic scavenging would have involved the use of long range cues, such as birds circling overhead. Endurance running would have been advantageous in this setting because it allowed hominins to reach the carcass more quickly. Selection pressures would have been very high for strategic scavenging, because hominins were diurnal, while their major competitors (hyenas, lions, etc.) were not. Thus, they would have had to make sure to capitalize on daytime carcasses. Selection pressure also came from the weakness of Homo. Because they were very weak, they were unlikely to drive off any large competition at the carcass. This fact led to an even higher need for a way to reach the carcass before these competitors. Endurance running and persistence hunting Persistence hunting is \\"a form of pursuit hunting in which [the hunter uses] endurance running during the midday heat to drive [prey] into hyperthermia and exhaustion so they can easily be killed\\". Many question persistence hunting's plausibility when bow and arrow and other technologies were so much more efficient. However, in the Early Stone Age (ESA), spears were only sharpened wood, and hominins had not begun using tools. The lack of spearheads or bows meant they could only hunt from very close range‚Äîbetween 6 and 10 meters. Hominins thus must have developed a way to stab prey from close range without causing serious bodily harm to themselves. Persistence hunting makes killing an animal easier by first bringing it to exhaustion, so that it can no longer retaliate violently. Persistence hunters work by hunting in the middle of the day, when it is hottest. Hunters choose a single target prey and chase it at a speed between its trot and gallop, which is extremely inefficient for the animal. The hunter then continues pursuing over a period of hours, during which he may lose sight of the animal. In this case, the hunter must use tracks and an understanding of the animal to continue the chase. The prey eventually overheats and becomes unable to continue fleeing. Homo, which does not overheat as quickly because of its superior thermoregulation capabilities, is then able to stab the prey while it is incapacitated and cannot attack. Tracking and running Due to the complexity of following a fleeing animal, tracking methods must have been a prerequisite for the use of endurance running in persistence hunting. Scientists posit that early tracking methods were developed in open, sparsely vegetated terrain such as the Kalahari Desert in southern Africa. This \\"systemic tracking\\" involves simply following the footprints of animals and was most likely used for tracking grassland species on soft terrain. Skeletal remains suggest that during the Middle Stone Age, hominins used systemic tracking to scavenge for medium-sized animals in vegetation cover, but for hunting antelope in more open grasslands. From the Middle Stone Age into the Later Stone Age, tracking methods developed into what is termed \\"speculative tracking\\". When tracks could not easily be found and followed, Homo predicted where tracks were most likely to be found and interpreted other signs to locate prey. This advanced method of tracking allowed for the exploitation of prey in a variety of terrains, making endurance running for persistence hunting more plausible. The process of tracking can last many hours and even days in the case of very large mammals. Often, the hunter(s) will have to run after the animal to keep up. The skeletal parameters of the tibia of early modern humans and Neanderthals have been compared with runners, and it surprisingly shows that these individuals were running even more than cross- country runners today. Particularly, European Neanderthals, the Skhul and Qafzeh hominins, and Late Stone Age Khoisan score very high compared to runners. This is consistent with modern observations of Khoisan, who routinely spend hours running after animals that have been shot with arrows. Examples of persistence hunters Although exact dates and methods of persistence hunting are difficult to study, several recent accounts of persistence hunting have been recorded. Tribes in the Kalahari Desert in Botswana have been known to employ endurance running to scavenge and hunt prey. In the open country, the Xo and Gwi tribes run down slow-moving animals such as aardvark and porcupines, while during the hotter part of the day, they target animals such as eland, kudu, gemsbok, hartebeest, duiker, steenbok, cheetah, caracal, and African wildcats. In addition to these existing African tribes, it has been suggested that the Tarahumara people in Mexico and the Paiute people and Navajo in the American Southwest, used persistence hunting to capture prey including deer and pronghorn. The Aborigines in Australia are known to have hunted kangaroo in similar ways. Due to the increased availability of weapons, nutrition, tracking devices, and motor vehicles, one may argue that persistence hunting is no longer an effective method of hunting animals for food. However, there are examples of the practice occurring in modern times: the Xo and Gwi in the central Kalahari, still practice persistence hunting and have developed advanced methods of doing so. Similarly, the Russian Lykov family that lived in isolation for 40 years also used persistence hunting due to a lack of weapons. File:Red hartebeest photo.jpg|Red Hartebeest File:Kudu photo.jpg|Kudu File:Gemsbok photo.jpg|Gemsbok In culture and folklore In the oral traditions of the Hadza, an isolated aboriginal people of hunter- gatherers living in Tanzania, the Tlaatlanebe in their folk history's second epoch practiced this. In the first epoch, the world was inhabited by large hairy humanoids called Akakaanebe (\\"ancestors\\"), who did not yet possess tools or fire. They simply \\"stared\\" at game until it fell dead, referring to either scavenging or early persistence hunting without weapons, or a combination of the two. They did not build houses but slept under trees. The Tlaatlanebe of the second epoch, however, were large but without hair and lived in caves. As animals had grown more wary of humans due to earlier hunting, they now had to be chased and hunted with dogs. Criticisms While there is evidence supporting selection on human morphology to improve endurance running ability, there is some dispute over whether the ecological benefits of scavenging and persistence hunting foraging behaviors were the driving force behind this development. The majority of the arguments opposing persistence hunting and scavenging behaviors are linked to the fact that the paleohabitat and paleoecology of early Homo were not conducive to these behaviors. It is thought that the earliest members of Homo lived in African savanna-woodlands. This environment consisted of open grassland, as well as parts with dense vegetation‚Äîan intermediate between forest and open savannas. The presence of such tree covering would reduce visibility and so require tracking skills. This causes problems for the hypothesis of persistence hunting and running to aid scavenging. Against persistence hunting Ungulates are known from archaeological evidence to have been the main prey of the early Homo, and given their great speed, they would have easily been able to outrun early hominins. Ungulate speed, coupled with the variable visibility of the savanna- woodland, meant that hunting by endurance running required the ability to track prey. Pickering and Bunn argue that tracking is part of a sophisticated cognitive skill set that early hominins would not have had, and that even if they were following a trail of blood left by an injured ungulate‚Äîwhich may have been in their cognitive capacity‚Äîthe ability to craft penetrating projectile technology was absent in early hominins. It has been suggested that modern hunters in Africa do not use persistence hunting as a foraging method, and most often give up a chase where the trail they were following ends in vegetation. The rare groups of hunters who do occasionally participate in persistence hunting are able to do so because of the extremely hot and open environments. In these groups, a full day of rest and recovery is required after a hunt, indicating the great toll persistence hunts take on the body, making them rare undertakings. Finally, in critique of Liebenberg's research on modern day persistence hunting, it was revealed that the majority of the hunts initiated were prompted for filming rather than spontaneous, and that few of these hunts were successful. The hunts that were successful involved external factors such as the hunters being able to stop and refill water bottles. A response to these criticisms has been formulated by Lieberman et al., noting that it is unclear how humans could have grown to occupy a new niche as a diurnal social carnivore without persistence hunting, as the weapons preferred in modern hunter-gatherer tribes would not have been available at the time. Against scavenging The proposed benefit of endurance running in scavenging is the ability of early hominins to outcompete other scavengers in reaching food sources. However paleoanthropological studies suggest that the savanna-woodland habitat caused a very low competition environment. Due to low visibility, carcasses were not easily located by mammalian carnivores, resulting in less competition.

In 2008, judges Michael Conahan and Mark Ciavarella were accused of accepting money in return for imposing harsh adjudications on juveniles to increase occupancy at for-profit detention centers. Ciavarella disposed thousands of children to extended stays in youth centers for offenses as trivial as mocking an assistant principal on Myspace or trespassing in a vacant building. After a judge rejected an initial plea agreement in 2009, a federal grand jury returned a 48-count indictment. In 2010, Conahan pleaded guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy and was sentenced to 17.5 years in federal prison. Ciavarella opted to go to trial the following year. He was convicted on 12 of 39 counts and sentenced to 28 years in federal prison. In the wake of the scandal, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania overturned hundreds of adjudications of delinquency in Luzerne County. The Juvenile Law Center filed a class action lawsuit against the judges and numerous other parties, and the Pennsylvania state legislature created a commission to investigate juvenile justice problems in the county.  Investigations  Pennsylvania's Judicial Conduct Board received four complaints about Michael Conahan between 2004 and 2008, but later admitted it failed to investigate any of them, nor had it sought documentation regarding the cases involved. The FBI was tipped off about Conahan and nepotism in the county courts in 2006. An additional investigation into improper sentencing in Luzerne County began in early 2007 as a result of requests for assistance from several youths received by the Philadelphia-based Juvenile Law Center. Attorneys from the Center determined that several hundred cases were tried without the defendants receiving proper counsel. In April 2008, the Center petitioned the Pennsylvania Supreme Court seeking relief for alleged violation of the youths' civil rights. The application of relief was later denied, then reconsidered in January 2009 when corruption charges against both Conahan and Mark Ciavarella surfaced. The FBI and the IRS also investigated Conahan and Ciavarella, although the exact dates and scope of these federal investigations were not made public. Part of the investigation was revealed to have occurred during disciplinary hearings over the conduct of another former Luzerne County judge, Ann H. Lokuta. Lokuta was brought before the Judicial Conduct Board in November 2006 to answer charges of using court workers to do her personal bidding, openly displaying bias against some attorneys arguing before her, and publicly berating staff to cause mental distress. The board ruled against Lokuta in November 2008, and she was removed from the bench. During the course of the hearings, Lokuta charged that Conahan was behind a conspiracy to have her removed. She aided the federal investigation into the \\"kids for cash\\" scheme prior to the Conduct Board's ruling, and a stay order was issued in March 2009 by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in light of the ongoing investigations, halting Lokuta's removal and the special election that was to be held to replace her. During the Lokuta hearing, Conahan testified that there were no social relationships amongst the county judges. However, Judge Michael Toole, who was later convicted of case fixing, as well as another judge, had each stayed at a Florida condo jointly owned by Conahan and Ciavarella. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided to uphold Lokuta's removal from the bench in January 2011, finding she had received a fair trial, regardless of Conahan's testimony. It also ordered the expungements of the records of 2,401 of those juveniles who were affected.  Charges and pleas  A statement from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania outlined the charges against the two judges on January 26, 2009. The charges outlined in the information described actions between 2000 and 2007 by both judges to assist in the construction and population of private juvenile facilities operated by the two Pennsylvania Child Care companies, acting in an official capacity in favor of the private facilities over the facility operated by Luzerne County. The U.S. Attorney charged that in 2002 Conahan, who at the time was President Judge of the court, used his authority to remove funding for the county-operated facility. The judges were alleged to have received \\"millions of dollars\\" in payments for the completion of a binding agreement between the court and the private facilities, co-owned by attorney Robert Powell, to use their services and the subsequent closing of the county facility. The methods used to conceal the payments involved several parties and transactions which resulted in allegations of tax evasion against the two. Ciavarella and Conahan were also charged with \\"Ordering juveniles to be sent to these facilities in which the judges had a financial interest even when Juvenile Probation Officers did not recommend placement,\\" according to the statement. Original, negotiated plea agreements called for both judges to serve up to seven years in prison, pay fines and restitution, and accept responsibility for the crimes. However, on July 30, 2009, Judge Edwin M. Kosik of Federal District Court in nearby Scranton rejected the plea agreement, citing \\"post-guilty plea conduct and expressions from the defendants\\" that he ruled did not satisfy the terms of the agreement. Kosik wrote that Conahan and Ciavarella continued to deny their crimes even in the face of overwhelming evidence, and therefore did not merit sentences that were well below federal sentencing guidelines. Attorneys for the two judges brought a motion requesting reconsideration of the judge's rejection of the plea agreement. The motion was denied on August 24, 2009, and Ciavarella and Conahan subsequently withdrew their guilty pleas, an action which eventually resulted in a jury trial for Ciavarella and additional charges against the former judges. Following the plea withdrawals, on September 9, 2009, a federal grand jury in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania returned a 48-count indictment against Ciavarella and Conahan including racketeering, fraud, money laundering, extortion, bribery, and federal tax violations. Both judges were arraigned on the charges on September 15, 2009. Ciavarella and Conahan entered pleas of not guilty on all counts and remained free on $1 million in bail, despite federal prosecutors' contentions that their bail should be raised. Prosecutors argued the judges' bail should have been higher, since they faced the possibility of substantially more prison time and there had been evidence of attempts made to shield assets. Robert Powell, an attorney and co-owner of the two juvenile facilities at the heart of the scandal, pleaded guilty on July 1, 2009, to failing to report a felony and being an accessory to tax evasion conspiracy, in connection with $770,000 in kickbacks he paid to Ciavarella and Conahan in exchange for facilitating the development of his juvenile detention centers. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court temporarily suspended Powell's law license on September 1, citing his criminal conviction. Robert Mericle, the prominent real estate developer who built the two juvenile facilities, pleaded guilty on September 3, 2009, to failing to disclose a felony. Mericle had failed to tell a grand jury he had paid $2.1 million to Ciavarella and Conahan as a finder's fee. As part of his plea, Mericle agreed to pay $2.15 million to fund local children's health and welfare programs. Mericle faced up to three years in prison and a $250,000 maximum fine. Mericle was released from federal custody in 2015 after serving a one-year sentence. Sandra Brulo, the former Deputy Director of Forensic Services for the Luzerne County Juvenile Probation Office, agreed to plead guilty in March 2009 to federal obstruction of justice. Those charges stemmed from actions Brulo took after she became aware she had been named in the federal civil action. Brulo backdated her recommendation of a placement she made concerning a juvenile defendant in September 2007, and changed her original recommendation of placement to probation.  Criminal verdicts and sentences  Mark Ciavarella mug shot On February 18, 2011, following a trial, a federal jury convicted Ciavarella on 12 of the 39 remaining counts he faced including racketeering, a crime in which prosecutors said the former judge used children \\"as pawns to enrich himself.\\" In convicting Ciavarella of racketeering, the jury agreed with prosecutors that he and Conahan had taken an illegal payment of nearly $1 million from a youth center's builder, then hid the money. The panel of six men and six women also found Ciavarella guilty of \\"honest services mail fraud\\" and of being a tax cheat, for failing to list that money and more on his annual public financial-disclosure forms and on four years of tax returns. In addition, they found him guilty of conspiring to launder money. The jurors acquitted Ciavarella of extortion and bribery in connection with $1.9 million that prosecutors said the judges extracted from the builder and owner of two youth centers, including allegations that Ciavarella shared the proceeds of FedEx boxes that were stuffed with tens of thousands of dollars in cash. Following Ciavarella's conviction, he and his lawyer appeared on the steps of the courthouse to give an impromptu press conference. The press conference was interrupted by Sandy Fonzo, whose son Edward Kenzakoski committed suicide in June 2010 after Ciavarella adjudicated him to placement, despite Kenzakoski's first-time offender status. On August 11, 2011, Ciavarella was sentenced to 28 years in federal prison as a result of his conviction. He is currently being held at the Federal Correctional Institution, Ashland, a low-security federal prison in eastern Kentucky. He is scheduled for release in 2035, when he will be 85 years old. Ciavarella appealed his conviction to the Third Circuit and it was rejected on July 25, 2013. However, Ciavarella has continued to appeal, contending that the Supreme Court's decision in the case of ex-Governor of Virginia Robert McDonnell narrowed the scope of the honest services fraud statute. On January 9, 2018, federal judge Christopher C. Conner threw out Ciavarella's convictions for racketeering, conspiracy to commit racketeering, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Conner upheld Ciavarella's contention that his attorneys failed to raise statute of limitations claims on those charges. He ordered a new trial on those counts, but allowed the honest services fraud convictions to stand. On September 23, 2011, Conahan was sentenced to 17 and a half years in federal prison after pleading guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy. Due to coronavirus concerns, he was released from prison in June 2020, six years early On November 4, 2011, Powell was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to failing to report a felony and being an accessory to tax conspiracy. He was incarcerated at the Federal Prison Camp, Pensacola, a low-security facility in Florida, and was released from a halfway house on April 16, 2013. On August 10, 2015, a judge approved a $4.75M settlement agreement for Powell, for having paid kickbacks related to the adjudication of at least 2,400 juveniles. Robert Mericle's sentencing in connection with his guilty plea for failing to report a felony was delayed pending his anticipated testimony in the bribery trial of former Congressman and Pennsylvania State Senator Raphael Musto. On November 23, 2010, a federal grand jury had issued a six-count indictment against Musto, charging him with accepting more than $28,000 from an unnamed company and individual in exchange for his help in obtaining grants and funding. Musto denied any wrongdoing. After Musto died on April 24, 2014, Mericle was sentenced the next day to one year in prison by Senior District Judge Edwin M. Kosik. Mericle was ordered to pay a $250,000 fine and to report to the Federal Bureau of Prisons on May 14, 2014. He was released on May 29, 2015. On October 1, 2019, Ciavarella was disbarred on consent from the practice of law by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.http://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/DisciplinaryBoard/out/26DB2012-Ciavarella,%20Jr..pdf  Victim lawsuits  Acting under a rarely used power established in 1722 and reserved for extraordinary circumstances, known as \\"King's Bench jurisdiction\\", the Pennsylvania Supreme Court appointed Senior Judge Arthur Grim of the Berks County Court of Common Pleas as special master to review all juvenile cases handled by Ciavarella on February 11, 2009. Grim returned his findings in an interim report dated March 11, 2009. He recommended that all adjudications handed down by Ciavarella from 2003 to 2008 be vacated, and that the affected juveniles' records be expunged. He concluded that due to Ciavarella's disregard for the juveniles' constitutional rights, as well as the kickbacks, no one who appeared before Ciavarella in that period had a truly impartial hearing. On March 26, 2009, the Supreme Court approved Grim's recommendations and ruled that Ciavarella had violated the constitutional rights of thousands of juveniles, and initially hundreds of juvenile adjudications were ordered overturned. A class action lawsuit was filed by the Juvenile Law Center on behalf of the juveniles who were adjudicated delinquent by Ciavarella despite not being represented by counsel or advised of their rights. Besides naming Ciavarella and Conahan, the suit seeks damages under the civil portion of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) against the judges' spouses and business associates, shell companies, youth center officials, and Luzerne County. Three other federal lawsuits filed on behalf of the victims have been consolidated with the Juvenile Law Center lawsuit into a master class action. An amended master complaint was filed on August 28, 2009. In June 2010, an injunction was filed on behalf of PA Child Care, Western PA Child Care, and Mid Atlantic Youth Services, the companies that provided treatment programs at the youth centers, to prevent the ordered destruction of thousands of juvenile records on the grounds the records are needed for the defense's case. On July 8, 2013, a three-judge panel of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in the case of Markel International Insurance Company v. Robert J. Powell, (his business partner) Gregory Zappala, et al., that the insurance company had no obligation to defend or indemnify the individuals or corporations involved, leaving the defendants liable for adverse judgments.  Interbranch Commission on Juvenile Justice  In the aftermath of the federal charges and defendant pleas, the Pennsylvania General Assembly moved to create a commission to investigate the entire set of circumstances surrounding the miscarriage of justice in Luzerne County. Sponsored by Representative Todd Eachus of Butler Township in Luzerne County, House Bill 1648 established the Interbranch Commission on Juvenile Justice in July 2009. The commission comprises 11 members, appointed from each branch of government in Pennsylvania, with four members chosen by the judiciary, four by the legislature and three by the governor. In signing the legislation on August 7, 2009, Governor Ed Rendell castigated Ciavarella and Conahan, saying they \\"violated the rights of as many as 6000 young people by denying them basic rights to counsel and handing down outrageously excessive sentences. The lives of these young people and their families were changed forever.\\" Scheduled to meet a minimum of once per month, the commission was organized to investigate the actions of and damages caused by the two judges and review the state of the Luzerne County courts left in the wake of their tenures. The commission was given power of subpoena and was required to complete its work and report its recommendations and findings to the three branches of state government by May 31, 2010.  In popular culture  The scandal was featured in Capitalism: A Love Story, the 2009 documentary by Michael Moore. A full- length documentary covering the scandal entitled Kids for Cash was released in February 2014, and has been favorably reviewed. In April 2014, CNBC's crime documentary series American Greed reported on the case. The scandal has also led to several portrayals in fictional works. The Law & Order: Special Victims Unit episode \\"Crush\\", the CSI: NY episode \\"Crossroads\\", an episode of The Good Wife, and an episode of For the People featured corrupt judges sending children to private detention centers. An episode of Cold Case called \\"Jurisprudence\\" is loosely based on this event. In 2015, crime fiction novelist Ace Atkins, using the nom de plume of the late Robert B. Parker, wrote Kickback, which borrows heavily from this case, transposing it into a Boston suburb instead. An episode of Billions called \\"Quality of Life\\" has a subplot inspired by the scandal in which a New York City judge sentences youths harshly for financial gain. The novel Corrupted by Lisa Scottoline includes the scandal, portraying characters in the book as victims of the scandal. The podcast \\"Swindled\\", has an episode in the first season titled \\"The Judges (Kids for Cash)\\" featuring this story.

He acts as a driver and enforcer for The Greek. He is Ukrainian, although Americans often assume he is Russian. He hates this and their subsequent tendency to nickname him \\"Boris\\". He is responsible for picking up containers of smuggled goods from the port and taking them to The Greek's front warehouse to be fenced. Biography Malatov is a trusted lieutenant in The Greek's import business. He is said by White Mike to be \\"straight muscle.\\" When vodka, appliances, electronics, drugs or Eastern Bloc women destined to be sex workers arrive in Baltimore, Sergei ensures the cargo is delivered to The Greek's associates in the city. He mentions that he has spent four years in prison in Ukraine, and that American prisons are nowhere near as harsh. Season two Sergei is supposed to collect fourteen prostitutes hidden in a cargo container from the docks, but when he does not receive the all-clear signal from The Greek's accomplice on the ship which delivered the women, he abandons the container on the waterfront. The Greek later learns that the girls were killed, and Sergei is sent to the Philadelphia port (the ship's next destination) to find the crewman. He infiltrates the port and captures the crewman. When The Greek and Spiros \\"Vondas\\" Vondopoulos arrive, the crewman tells them everything about how the girls were killed, and Spiros murders him. Sergei is charged with disposing of the body and The Greek instructs him to make sure there is no face or fingerprints. The body is later found and identified by a tattoo. Sergei is friendly with drug kingpin Proposition Joe, who is supplied by The Greek. He intervenes on behalf of Nick Sobotka ‚Äî because The Greek needs Nick and his uncle Frank's help to smuggle containers off of cargo ships ‚Äî when Ziggy Sobotka gets into debt with Proposition Joe's nephew, Cheese. He is ruthless in his work, and thorough in clean-up. When a drug dealer asks whether a recently found body was his handiwork, he retorts \\"Did he have hands? Did he have a face? Yes? Then it wasn't us. Idiot!\\" As most of the US population is not in police/federal DNA records (minus convicted felons, military, etc.), a body that has neither fingerprints, a recognizable appearance, or intact teeth is generally impossible to identify. When security camera footage of him abducting the crewman is discovered by a police detail investigating the deaths of the girls and smuggling on the docks, Sergei is persuaded to become an informer and turn on The Greek and Spiros, but The Greek has already escaped. After the events on season 2, Sergei was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole and sent to Jessup penitentiary to serve out his sentence. Season five Several years later, as rising kingpin Marlo Stanfield gets a line on Spiros \\"Vondas\\" Vondopoulos and the Greeks, he has Chris Partlow investigate the port investigation, as well as Sergei's criminal record at the courthouse. Upon learning that Sergei is locked up in Jessup, Marlo arranges a meeting with him. Initially, Marlo's access to Sergei is blocked by Avon Barksdale, who is effectively running the criminal activities within the prison, but after Marlo makes a payment to Avon's sister, Avon grants Marlo access to Sergei. Sergei, despite receiving a great deal of money from Marlo, is disrespectful and states that he does not need Marlo's help or money. However, Marlo points out that Sergei can win back some favor with the Greeks if he gets a message to Vondas regarding Marlo's intentions to do business with them. Avon encourages Sergei to cooperate with Marlo, and Sergei, realizing that Marlo is right that he can claim some credit if the deal happens, agrees to get in touch with Vondas.

It was first isolated in 1931 from the 90% methanol extract of a soybean meal, when it was found that hydrolysis with hydrochloric acid produced 1 mole each of genistein and glucose. Chemically it is the 7-O-beta- D-glucoside form of genistein and is the predominant form of the isoflavone naturally occurring in plants. In fact, studies in the 1970s revealed that 99% of the isoflavonoid compounds in soy are present as their glucosides. The glucosides are converted by digestive enzymes in the digestive system to exert their biological effects. Genistin is also converted to a more familiar genistein, thus, the biological activities including antiatherosclerotic, estrogenic and anticancer effects are analogous. Metabolism When ingested along the diet, genistin is readily converted to its aglycone form, genistein. It is hydrolyzed by removing the covalently bound glucose to form genistein and that genistein is the form of the compound that is absorbed in the intestine and is the form responsible for the biological activities of the isoflavone. The digestive metabolism was first demonstrated in 2002 that the gut microflora played a large role in the conversion of genistin to genistein. It was later found that enzymes present in the human small intestine and liver also have the ability to convert the isoflavone. Hydrolysis actually starts very quickly in the digestive system once genistin is ingested, conversion begins in the mouth and then continues in the small intestine. Moreover, both human saliva and the intestinal cell-free extract from mice can cause the complete conversion. Biological importance Estrogenic activity Genistin, like genistein, is a phytoestrogen as it was shown to stimulate estrogen-dependent breast cancer cell growth in vivo. At a concentration of 1200 ppm, genistin caused significant increase of growth of breast tumors (MCF-7), cellular proliferation and estrogen-responsive pS2 gene expression in mice. Removal of genistin or genistein from the diet caused tumors to regress. Antiviral activity Genistin and other isoflavones are demonstrated to be bioactive within the neonatal intestine and may reduce the severity of rotavirus infections; genistin alone shows inhibition of the viral infectivity by 40-60%. Bone metabolism In vitro study have shown that both genistin and genistein are capable of enhancing bone metabolism in the femoral- metaphyseal tissues of elderly rats. The presence of genistein or genistin in the tissue culture caused a significant increase in alkaline phosphatase activity, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and calcium contents. The effect of genistein was greater than that of genistin. It is also revealed that genistin has a strong bone loss preventive activity on experimental rats, and is especially enhanced by combination with fructooligosaccharides. The amount of new bone produced by grafting genistin in collagen matrix was compared to the bone produced by collagen matrix alone in New Zealand white rabbits, and was observed that genistin caused significant increase in bone formation.

It is owned by Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council, the Highways Agency, Network Rail and the Environment Agency, and managed by the council. Geography The park comprises of countryside to the west of Tonbridge. The park has two lakes, Barden Lake and Haysden Water, and has a stretch of the River Medway running through it, with various branches and streams. Consequently there are a large number of bridges, many of which are named. The park is home to a variety of wildlife including waterfowl, wild flowers, and insect life. It is designated as a Site of Nature Conservation Interest, and as of it has been designated a Local Nature Reserve. The A21 passes on a viaduct near Haysden Water. Immediately to the east of this viaduct, and roughly parallel to it, is the Medway flood barrier. The railway line from Tonbridge towards Redhill, Surrey also passes through the park. History The park was opened as a Country Park in 1988, but the land had been partly owned by the Tonbridge Council and had been used by the public long before then. It is still managed by Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council. Cycleway on the Straight Mile Leading off the River Medway is the Straight Mile, which was dug in 1830. James Christie intended this to be a canal leading to Tonbridge Water Mill, but it was never filled with water. The Stone Lock, built in 1829 (also by James Christie) at Haysden, remains largely intact. It leads towards Haysden Water (and continues on the other side of Haysden Water, outside the park). The lock was intended for transferring barges between the level of the Straight Mile and the higher level of the River Medway.James Christie and the Penshurst Canal Another section of the park is The Shallows, a winding stream leading off the River Medway, with various gravel beds for crossing the river.Tonbridge Collectables - Early Tonbridge Finds It was at one stage part of the River Medway, with meanders which were sometimes shallow and therefore difficult to navigate with large boats. Since the river was used by canal craft, a navigable diversion was constructed around this section. The Shallows then became a quiet backwater stream which is gradually developing into marshland.https://web.archive.org/web/20110927074634/http://www.tmbc.gov.uk/assets/Leisure_Tourism/HaysdenHistoricTrail.pdf Barden Lake was created when sand and gravel were extracted from the land between 1974 and 1980. Dragline excavators were used to dig the material out. The Lake is approximately 3.6 metres (12 feet) deep. A World War II pillbox can be found in the hedgerow along the riverbank. This pillbox and others along the River Medway formed part of the Ironside Line. On 27 May 1944, Prime Minister Winston Churchill put General Sir Edmund Ironside in charge of creating a first line of defence against German invasion forces.Pill Boxes A project to name the 14 bridges that are included in the park was announced on at the Tonbridge Forum; names had been decided. As at 2015, this work appears to be complete. How to get there From Tonbridge, the Lower Haysden Road leads towards Lower Haysden and Upper Haysden. On the right (when driving from Tonbridge) is the visitor centre and car park. Regional Cycle Route 12 leads from Tonbridge through the park towards Penshurst, and can also be used by pedestrians. The nearest railway station is Tonbridge (1.5 miles to the visitor centre). Activities The park is a setting for a variety of leisure activities. *Walking - The Eden Valley WalkEden Valley Walk Walking Route and Wealdway lead through the park.

The individual films are highly diverse in content, although many of them feature humour and different forms of queer sex. The creative decisions were based on a manifesto with the aim to create pornography that is non-commercial and follows feminist ideals. The film sparked controversy before and after its release because of sexually provocative content and the fact that it was mainly financed through public funds. Film critics were split in their reception; some found the film amusingly provocative while others thought it was dull. Plot The thirteen short films that make up the entire collection vary considerably in length and style. # Skin features two figures, one male and one female, clad in full-body nylon stockings caressing and kissing each other intimately. After a while, the two figures begin to cut open the nylon with a pair of scissors to reveal the naked skin underneath, and engage in oral and penetrative sex. There is no dialogue and only soft background music. Directed by Elin Magnusson. # Fruitcake is a mix of close-up shots of various objects and human anuses being licked, dripped with saliva, fingered or penetrated with sex toys. The images are accompanied by a monologue. Directed by Sara Kaaman and Ester Martin Bergsmark. # Night Time shows a woman kissing a man passionately while filming herself. They both proceed to perform oral sex on each other while the woman later uses a vibrator to reach orgasm. Directed by Nelli Roselli. # Dildoman is the only animated film in the collection. It shows images of a men's club where masturbating adult or middle-aged men watch two women having sex on a pool table. One of the men is then suddenly grabbed by one of the women, who now dwarfs him. The woman proceeds to insert the man into her vagina. When she reaches climax, the man inside her goes limp. The film ends with a shot of the front of the men's club. Directed by √Ösa Sandz√©n. # Body Contact portrays two women, one filming the other, searching for a man to have sex with on the Swedish dating site Body Contact. A man with a Scanian dialect shows his penis to the women through a webcam. Later the man pays them a visit, but is unnerved by the presence of the camera. The two women convince him to have sex. Directed by Pella K√•german. # Red Like Cherry is a series of quick, blurred clips of unidentifiable people swimming in the surf of a beach and then having sex in a room. Directed by Tora M√•rtens. # On Your Back Woman! is a series of clips of nude or semi-nude women wrestling each other. Directed by Wolfe Madam. # Phone Fuck features a newly separated lesbian couple who talk over the telephone and eventually engage in phone sex. Directed by Ingrid Ryberg. # Brown Cock shows the naked pelvis of a Caucasian woman. Her vagina is penetrated by a brown dildo held by a mixed-race woman, who then goes on to fist her. The two women engage in sex-related dialogue throughout the scene, commenting the sex act. Directed by Universal Pussy. # Flasher Girl on tour is a semi-documentary manifesto of Swedish artist Joanna Rytel and her alter ego Flasher Girl, a woman flasher. In the film she travels to Paris where she exposes herself to men and expounds on her motives for doing so. Directed by Joanna Rytel. # Authority starts with a lightly clad androgynous woman breaking into an abandoned lot in Berlin and spraying graffiti. She is caught in the act by a similarly androgynous female police officer, who chases her into an empty building but is eventually overpowered and bound. The two then engage in rough sexual activities, including spitting, slapping and anal sex. Directed by Marit √ñstberg, who later went on to direct 'When We Are Together We Can Be Everywhere' (2015). # For the Liberation of Men is an abstract mix of clips of a man clad in women's clothing masturbating and close-ups of an old woman's face. Directed by Jennifer Rainsford. # Come Together, the short that Engberg and others made before the twelve actual Dirty Diaries shorts, is included last in the collection. It consists of Engberg and several others filming themselves with mobile phones while masturbating and eventually reaching orgasm. Directed by Mia Engberg. Production The idea for creating Dirty Diaries emerged after Engberg and some of her friends made Come Together for the Stockholm International Film Festival. It was a short film where all the participants filmed themselves with mobile phone cameras while masturbating. Come Together received a large amount of negative commentary, primarily from men, who complained about the actor-photographers being unattractive. To Engberg, this was proof that pornographic films demanded that their female participants should be seen as pleasing to their primarily male audience.Oscarsson, Mattias Sydsvenska Dagbladet, \\"Porr mot erotikens klich√©er \\". August 17, 2009. Retrieved 23 September 2009. Engberg had previously made another feminist pornographic short called Selma and Sofie, which enjoyed some success. This and Engberg's record of other successful cultural ventures motivated the Swedish Film Institute to supply an initial 350,000 Swedish kronor, later supplemented with an additional 150,000.Roger, Susanne, Filmnyheterna, \\"Pornografi ur feministisk synvinkel \\". September 3, 2009. Retrieved 23 September 2009. Dirty Diaries Manifesto The film was based on a ten-point manifesto made available on the official website: 1\\\\. Beautiful the way we are To hell with the sick beauty ideals! Deep self-hatred keeps a lot of women's energy and creativity sapped. The energy that could be focused into exploring our own sexuality and power is being drained off into diets and cosmetics. Don't let the commercial powers control your needs and desires. 2\\\\. Fight for your right to be horny Male sexuality is seen as a force of nature that has to be satisfied at all costs while women's sexuality is accepted only if it adapts to men's needs. Be horny on your own terms. 3\\\\. A good girl is a bad girl We are fed up with the cultural clich√© that sexually active and independent women are either crazy or lesbian and therefore crazy. We want to see and make movies where Betty Blue, Ophelia and Thelma & Louise don't have to die in the end. 4\\\\. Smash capitalism and patriarchy The porn industry is sexist because we live in a patriarchal capitalist society. It makes profit out of people's needs for sex and erotica and women get exploited in the process. To fight sexist porn you have to smash capitalism and patriarchy. 5\\\\. As nasty as we wanna be Enjoy, take charge or let go. Say NO when you want, to be able to say YES when YOU want. 6\\\\. Legal and free abortion is a human right! Everyone has the right to control their own body. Millions of women suffer from unwanted pregnancies and die from illegal abortions every year. Fuck the moral right for preaching against birth control and sex information. 7\\\\. Fight the real enemy! Censorship cannot liberate sexuality. It is impossible to change the image of women's sexuality if sexual images in themselves are taboo. Don't attack women for displaying sex. Attack sexism for trying to control our sexuality. 8\\\\. Stay Queer A lot of opposition to erotica is homophobic and even more transphobic. We don't believe in the fight between the sexes but in the fight against sexes. Identify as any gender you want and make love to whoever you want. Sexuality is diverse. 9\\\\. Use Protection \\"I'm not saying go out an' do it, but if you do, strap it up before you smack it up.\\" (Missy Elliott) 10\\\\. Do it yourself Erotica is good and we need it. We truly believe that it is possible to create an alternative to the mainstream porn industry by making sexy films we like. Release Dirty Diaries was first shown at a gala premiere at the small neighbourhood cinema Bio Rio near Hornstull in Stockholm on September 3 and released on DVD the same day. There were further screenings on the weekend of September 5‚Äì6, which drew large crowds. Though public interest was intense and all screenings were sold out, no further shows in Stockholm were scheduled. The reason stated by Bio Rio and Engberg was that the cinema screenings were intended to be limited, and that the films were intended to be enjoyed on DVD.Lundin, Thomas, Metro, \\"Ingen chans att se 'Dirty diaries' p√• bio\\", September 3, 2009; Sk√∂ld, Jenny, Statliga medel bakom h√•rdporr p√• film , September 7, 2009. Retrieved 23 September 2009. The film also saw limited theatrical distribution in Finland.Dirty Diaries at Elonet Reception Political reactions The funding from the Swedish Film Institute (SFI), which receives most of its funding directly from the Swedish government, sparked controversy in Sweden. Using tax money to finance pornography was considered offensive by some. Beatrice Fredriksson, member of the Moderate Party youth organization and author of the Anti-Feminist Initiative Blog, labelled the use of public funds as hypocrisy, since mainstream pornography would never receive the same financial support.Fredriksson, Beatrice, The Local, \\"'Taxpayers should not have to fund feminist porn' \\". September 3, 2009. Retrieved 23 September 2009. Marit √ñstberg, one of the film's directors, defended the public financing of the project by stressing that the values behind Dirty Diaries are radically different from that of mainstream pornography.√ñstberg, Marit, Aftonbladet, \\"'R√§tt att ge skattepengar till feministisk porr'\\". September 5, 2009. Retrieved 23 September 2009. Dirty Diaries also received criticism from feminists critical against pornography in general. Prolific Swedish director and feminist Suzanne Osten voiced scepticism, referring to her belief that pornography is inherently objectifying and that feminist pornography would therefore constitute an oxymoron.Curman, Sofia, Dagens Nyheter, \\"Porr f√∂r feminister? \\". August 28, 2009. Retrieved 23 September 2009. A scan of the letter from the director of the Swedish Film Institute Cissi Elwin Frenkel to Minister of Culture, Lena Adelsohn Liljeroth. Due to the debate over the use of tax money for financing a pornographic feature, the director of the SFI Cissi Elwin Frenkel considered it necessary to write a letter to Swedish Minister of Culture, Lena Adelsohn Liljeroth, and explain exactly why it received the financing.Helmerson, Erik, Dagens Nyheter, \\"Filminstitutet f√∂rklarar porrfilmen \\". September 22, 2009. Retrieved 23 September 2009. Elwin Frenkel repeatedly maintained that SFI does not support pornography, and that Dirty Diaries received financing because it aimed to try a new approach to depicting female sexuality. Rasmus Malm in G√∂teborgs-Posten summarized the controversial potential of Dirty Diaries as \\"a Kinder Egg from hell, specially designed to provoke Christian Democrat columnists. Three nightmares in one: porn and gay sex paid for with tax money\\".Original quote in Swedish: Herregud, det h√§r √§r ju som ett Kinder√§gg fr√•n helvetet specialdesignat f√∂r att reta upp KD-ledare.

The unusual circumstance of government- sponsored pornography also led to the topic being the butt of a parody by US talk show host Conan O'Brien. Critical response Critical reception of the films themselves were mixed. Hynek Pallas of Stockholm-based Svenska Dagbladet praised the shorts as \\"amusing, provoking and exciting\\", especially the opening short Skin\\".Pallas, Hynek, Svenska Dagbladet, \\"Kvinnor visar en ny sida av porren\\". September 4, 2009. Retrieved 23 September 2009. Lars B√∂hlin of V√§sterbottens Folkblad described it as \\"dull, ugly and rather artistic\\"Original quote in Swedish: Hur ser feministisk porr ut? Tr√•kig, ful och ganska konstn√§rlig. and criticized its being filmed with mobile phone cameras in an age of large television screens. B√∂hlin also noted his negative reactions to the portrayal of a man being lured into having sex in front of a camera in Body contact and expressed sympathies for the people exposed to the advances of Johanna Rytel in Flasher girl on tour. Some of the films, like Dildoman and Skin, were considered to be of good quality, but B√∂hlin was doubtful whether they should be considered to be pornographic at all.B√∂hlin, Lars, V√§sterbottens Folkblad, \\"Inte ens feministisk porr k√§nns lovande\\". September 4, 2009. Retrieved 23 September 2009. Camilla Carnmo, writing for Sm√•landsposten was more positive, commenting that it was \\"good-looking and professional\\" despite being filmed only with phone cameras, but also added that it was \\"more art than porn\\",Original quote in Swedish: Dirty Diaries ger nya bilder. Men √§r det porr i betydelsen runkrulle? Njae. Porr i betydelsen n√§rbilder p√• k√∂n? Ja, definitivt. Men √∂verv√§gande mer konst √§n porr. even if it fulfilled the technical criteria for traditional pornography. Unlike B√∂hlin, Carnmo praised Flasher Girl on tour for \\"combining humor, sex and politics in a liberating way\\".Original quote in Swedish: B√§st gillar jag Joanna Rytels Flasher Girl on tour som kombinerar humor med politik och sex p√• ett befriande s√§tt.

A former religious student, Allen was considered one of the most notorious criminals in the city and was known as the \\"Wickedest Man in New York\\". A public crusade against him, headed by lawyer and journalist Oliver Dyer, resulted in a reform movement known as the \\"Water Street revival\\". The campaign, in which Allen and other notorious underworld figures had been \\"reformed\\" by religious leaders, was later revealed to be a fraud following exclusive expos√©s by The New York Times and the New York World forcing Allen to leave the city. Early life and criminal career Born to a prominent and well-to-do religious family in upstate New York near Syracuse, two of his brothers became Presbyterian preachers while a third became a Baptist minister. The rest of his brothers, however, settled in New York City where they became \\"professional burglars and footpads\\", most especially Theodore Allen who became one of the city's earliest underworld figures. Allen was attending the Union Theological Seminary when, around 1850, he left the institution to join his brothers in New York.Martin, Edward Winslow.

(pg. 50-56) He lived with his brothers for about a year, who tutored him in burglary, and did \\"quite well by his own account\\" but was eventually cast out by his brothers after confessing to being a police informant.Asbury, Herbert. All Around the Town: Murder, Scandal, Riot and Mayhem in Old New York. New York: Alfred A. Knoff, 1929. (pg. 123-131) It was during this time that he married a \\"lush worker\\" known as Little Susie and the two moved to the waterfront district of the infamous Fourth Ward in 1855. While Susie continued her trade of \\"rolling drunks\\", Allen was employed as a runner for a crimp house. His particular job was to lure sailor, or any passersby, into the establishment where they would be drugged and shanghaied for outgoing vessels short on crew. Allen himself was eventually suffered a similar fate two years later when, while drinking with his employer one night, was drugged, robbed and woke up hours later \\"in the forecastle of a ship bound for South America\\". Allen made his way back to New York six months later, and soon after his return, his former employer had been found \\"beaten to death with an iron belaying-pin\\". There was no evidence connecting Allen to the murder, but he was considered a suspect by police and decided to seek different means of employment. He and Susie moved to the district around Sixth Avenue and Thirteenth Street, in what would later become the \\"Tenderloin district\\", and began working for procuress Hester Jane Haskins. The husband and wife were among \\"respectable-looking young men and women\\" employed by Haskins to travel throughout New England to lure young women to New York with the promises of work. Once these women arrived, they were abducted and forced to work in brothels. When Haskins began kidnapping young girls from more prominent families, Allen and Susie decided to leave her organization. Haskins was arrested only a year later. Rise to fame in the New York underworld Returning to the waterfront, Allen and his wife opened a dance hall on Water Street. The dance hall also operated as a brothel occupied by twenty young women \\"who wore long black bodices of satin, scarlet skirts and stockings, and red topped boots with bells affixed to the ankles\\".Morris, Lloyd R. Incredible New York: High Life and Low Life of the Last Hundred Years. New York: Random House, 1951. (pg. 226) One of the girls who worked at Allen's establishment was supposedly the daughter of a Lieutenant-Governor in New England. She had originally come to New York to find her fortune and fell into the hands of procurers and forced her into prostitution. In time, Allen's resort became one of the principal hangouts for gangsters and other criminals of the Fourth Ward. By 1860, he had amassed a personal fortune of over $100,000. His resort became one of the earliest dance halls, and later the model for many of the city's most infamous dive bars, saloons and other resorts during the late 19th century and up until the turn of the 20th century. Among them were the Haymarket, McGurk's Suicide Hall, Paresis Hall and Billy McGlory's Armory Hall. It was reported that, every evening, \\"several hundred partake of the rude fun, among them are boys and girls below twelve years of age. The atmosphere reeks with blasphemy. The women are driven to their work by imprecation, and often by blows, from their task master.\\" Although involved in theft, procuring and possibly murder, Allen remained a devoutly religious man long after leaving the ministry. He opened his resort every afternoon at 1:00 pm, however he gathered his employees, including prostitutes, bartenders and musicians alike, and held a prayer meeting in a bar room in the back of the hall three days a week at noon. In each cubicle where Allen's women brought men, a Bible and other religious literature was available. On gala nights, these were often given away as souvenirs by Allen himself. Allen subscribed to almost every religious paper and magazine published in the United States during this time as well as his favorite newspapers the New York Observer and The Independent. He scattered these about the dance hall and bar room of the resort while every table and bench had The Little Wanderers' Friend, then a popular hymnbook. It was in this spirit that Allen would lead his employees and patrons in a sing-song, most often, \\"There is Rest for the Weary\\". Water Street revival Allen's resort received considerable coverage by newspapers and magazines, particularly in light of the colorful atmosphere and his eccentric manner, the most prominent of these being Packard's Monthly journalist Oliver Dyer who first referred to him as the \\"Wickedest Man in New York\\". Allen's activities also led to his being targeted by reformers and evangelical clergymen seeking to rid the city of vice and crime. The most prominent of these was Reverend A.C. Arnold, founder of the Howard Mission, who visited Allen's resort to persuade him to allow an ordained preacher to conduct his prayer meetings. On May 25, 1868, Arnold led a group of six clergymen and a number of devout laymen to Allen's dance hall. When they approached Allen, they found he was so drunk that he was unable to object when they held a prayer meeting lasting from midnight until around 4:00 am. The incident was covered extensively by the press causing regular curiosity seekers and ministers to visit the dance hall for several months. The unwanted attention drove Allen's regular customers away and he began to lose money. Arnold and other preachers continued to hold prayer meetings at the dance hall, usually whenever they were able to be given consent by an intoxicated Allen, and began to call upon him to close down the dance hall. Finally, at midnight on August 29, 1868, Allen's dance hall closed for the first time in seventeen years. The following morning, a notice was posted on the door. One day after the close of Allen's resort, A.C. Arnold publicly announced that Allen had been converted and reformed, and that he had forsaken his former occupation. Revival meetings were held in the resort several days later and, the following Sunday, Allen attended church services at the Howard Mission where its congregation prayed for him at Arnold's request. Allen's appearance at the mission gained attention by the press as well as the daily meetings at Allen's establishment which continued for a month. It was also during this time that the ministers had approached Allen's rivals, most notably Tommy Hadden, Kit Burns and Bill Slocum, to hold similar meetings in their establishments. On September 11, a prayer meeting was held in Hadden's Water Street boarding house with his consent although none were held in his more infamous Cherry Street resort. Meetings were also held in Bill Slocum's gin mill, also on Water Street, and Kit Burns \\"rat pit\\" held in his liquor store. Their establishments were also overrun by preachers and, while none of the men would attend services at the Howard Mission, they did allowed themselves to be mentioned in the congregation's prayers. This campaign, later to become known as the \\"Water Street revival\\", was declared in a public statement issued by many of the city's prominent religious leaders which explained its purpose claiming that Allen, Burns, Hadden and Slocum had freely allowed the use of their establishments for religious purposes because they had reformed and had renounced their lives of crime. An extensive investigation by The New York Times showed that the preachers, and certain financial backers, had paid Allen $350 for the use of his dance hall for a month. As part of their agreement, Allen had also agreed to sing hymns, prayer meeting and to claim that he had given his dance hall free of charge \\"because of his love of the preachers\\". These denouncements by The New York Times and the New York World caused serious damage to the preachers campaign as its large congregations began to desert the cause due to the perceived dishonesty by religious leaders. The \\"Water Street revival\\" eventually faded from public attention and was abandoned. Aftermath and final years While his competitors soon returned to their criminal ways, Allen never recovered from the Water Street revival. His underworld reputation was irrevocably damaged, his former criminal clientele regarding him as \\"loose and unsound\\", and most refrained from attending the dance hall. Although he still retained his women and musicians, he was forced to close the dance hall within a few months. His last public appearance was in late 1868 when he and his wife were arraigned in the Tombs Police Court, along with several of their girls, and charged with robbing a sailor of $15. One of the girls, Margaret Ware, was immediately held for trial while Allen himself was bound over $300 (or $500) bail for appearance in General Sessions. Appearing before Judge Joseph Dowling, Allen claimed that his arrest had been caused by Oliver Dyer and that the charges were a \\"put up job\\". The arresting officer, Captain Thomas Woolsey Thorne, accused Allen of running a \\"disorderly house\\". Allen denied this charge and insisted that is establishment had been in use for the past several days for religious meetings. Allen was released and the others not already sentenced were discharged. He died in West Perth, Fulton County, New York two years later. References Further reading *Browne, Junius Henri. The Great Metropolis: A Mirror of New York.

Biography Cook was born in Birmingham. He moved to the United States in 1985. Nike Cook started working for sports wear brand Nike in 1996. Cook worked his way up to head of the Nike project \\"Brand Jordan\\", working very closely with basketball star Michael Jordan while working at Nike. Manchester City On becoming the new owner of Manchester City, Thaksin Shinawatra contacted Cook about becoming CEO of the club after the departure of Alistair Mackintosh. Cook accepted the offer and was appointed CEO of the club in May 2008. His wages were ¬£1,500,000 in 2009. One of Cook's first tasks with his new club was to find a new manager after Sven-G√∂ran Eriksson had been dismissed; he targeted Mark Hughes of Blackburn Rovers. On 4 June 2008, Hughes signed a three-year deal with the club. On the day Hughes was unveiled to the media, Cook stated: \\"I am delighted to welcome Mark on board, In our view he is the brightest young manager in the game and he was our number one target for the manager's job.\\" In August 2008 he criticised club captain Richard Dunne, who the fans had voted player of the year for the previous four seasons, saying \\"China and India are gagging for football content to watch and we‚Äôre going to tell them that City is their content. We need a superstar to get through that door. Richard Dunne doesn‚Äôt roll off the tongue in Beijing\\". He also said of Thaksin, \\"Is he a nice guy? Yes. Is he a great guy to play golf with? Yes. Has he got the finances to run a club? Yes....Whether he's guilty of something over there, I can‚Äôt worry too much about....Morally, I feel comfortable in this environment\\". Just over a year later Cook said he felt \\"dreadful\\" about having made that comment. \\"I have made some mistakes in my life\\", Cook said, \\"but I deeply regretted my failure to do proper research on Thaksin\\". Cook's new task was player recruitment, completing the signings of Tal Ben Haim, Jo, Vincent Kompany, Pablo Zabaleta and Shaun Wright-Phillips. On 1 September, Manchester City were taken over by the Abu Dhabi United Group. Cook subsequently completed the transfer of Brazilian Robinho to the club from Real Madrid for a British transfer record of ¬£32.5 million. After the arrival of the new Abu Dhabi based owners many thought that they would opt for their own CEO but they decided to keep Cook on. They did, however, appoint a new chairman, Khaldoon Al Mubarak, who replaced the outgoing Shinawatra. After the 2009 January transfer window opened Mark Hughes and Cook sealed signings for Wayne Bridge, Craig Bellamy, Shay Given and Nigel de Jong. However, Cook failed in a world record bid to bring Kak√° to the club, blaming the breakdown in negotiations on A.C. Milan, stating, \\"If you want my personal opinion they bottled it. He clearly was for sale but we never got to meet with the player, the behaviour of A.C. Milan got in the way.\\" Cook also did much work away from transfers introducing the \\"My first City game\\" campaign where supporters of the club write in their memories of their first ever game watching the team, these have then been placed around the interior of the stadium. Many fans have contributed to this, including Ricky Hatton. After City finished 10th in the Premier League in Cook's first season with the club, he went about bringing in further targets of Hughes. In the summer of 2009 Cook signed Gareth Barry, Roque Santa Cruz, Stuart Taylor, Carlos Tevez, Emmanuel Adebayor, Kolo Tour√©, Joleon Lescott and Sylvinho. Cook also built his own team around him with Brian Marwood joining the club. Alongside Al Mubarak, Cook has seen the complete overhaul of the club's training base at Carrington, and scheduled a 2009 summer tour of South Africa where the squad met Nelson Mandela. He made a gaffe by welcoming Uwe R√∂sler to the Manchester United Hall of Fame instead of the Manchester City Hall of Fame, and was booed by Manchester City fans. He wrote apology letters to 70 Manchester City supporters' clubs. On 19 December 2009, Cook was key in relieving Mark Hughes of his duties as City's manager, after just two wins in twelve games, and appointing former Inter Milan manager Roberto Mancini as his replacement. In September 2011, Cook offered his resignation after insensitive email allegations towards a player's mother. The Manchester City board believed there was evidence to back the allegations and accepted his resignation on 9 September 2011. Chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak thanked Cook for his efforts in transforming the club's infrastructure and direction.

Background Alderson‚Äôs academic training was at George Washington, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania. He served as president of the American Marketing Association and was highly active in The Institute of Management Sciences. He began his business career at the U.S. department of Commerce, founded the internationally prominent marketing consulting firm of Alderson Associates, and served as a professor at Wharton University of Pennsylvania after joining it in 1959. While always deeply involved in the advancement of marketing science he also believed that theory and practice go hand in hand. This also suited his scientific method. From a methodological perspective, he emphasized inductive theorizing from market place events, providing a balanced to the neo-classical theories of firm behaviour. He also had the ability to communicate in the language of many disciplines and to bridge the business and academic communities.Wright, John S. and Smith, Wendell R. (1966) Leaders in marketing: Wroe Alderson. Journal of Marketing; Jan 66, Vol. 30 Issue 1, p64-65, 2p, 1 bw. A significant element of his contribution to marketing thinking is his insistence upon an interdisciplinary approach, attracting the interest of scientists from other fields and borrowing from other disciplines such as psychology, philosophy and anthropology.Wright, John S. and Smith, Wendell R. (1966) op. cit. He argued that firms are ecological systems that grow and adapt to change; each seeks its own niche based on organised behaviour systems: \\"All marketing activity is an aspect of the interaction among organized behavior systems related to each other in what may be described as an ecological network. Operating systems are a subclass of behavior systems, distinguished by inputs and outputs and the structuring of processes to achieve efficiency.\\" \\"The functionalist approach is concerned with the functioning of systems, and the study of structure is essential to the analysis and interpretations of functions. Every phase of marketing can be understood as human behavior within the framework of some operating system. Survival and growth are implicit goals of every behavior system, including most particularly those that operate in the market place.\\"Introduction to part one of his 1957 book, Marketing Behavior and Executive Action He also argued for heterogeneity of both supply and demand, introducing the ideas of market segmentation and niche marketing and the status of the brand. Increased product variety provides consumers with offerings nearer their ideal points. Firms can strive for differential advantage through product variety. Amongst other accomplishments, he redefined the value-in-use concept as an alternative to the dominant value exchange theory, tracing it back through the ideas of Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas (the leading mediaeval theologian) and a variety of 17th, 18th and 19th century economists.Dixon, 1990 Wroe Anderson also rejected the idea that different aspects of utility should be attributed to production and marketing Wroe Alderson established the Annual Marketing Theory seminars, founded the Management Science Center at the University of Pennsylvania, and received the Pabst Award in 1944, Hall of Fame in Distribution in 1953, the Charles Coolidge Parlin Award in 1954, and the Paul D. Converse Award in 1955. Selected publications * Alderson, W. (1965) Dynamic Marketing Behavior: a Functionalist Theory of Marketing, Homewood, Illinois, Richard D. Irwin. * Alderson, W.

He played both football and hurling with Kerry from the 1950s till the 1970s, winning All Ireland and National League titles in both. As a dual player at club level, he won county championships in both codes. Club career Culloty played his club football with the Killarney Legion club as well as the East Kerry team. With East Kerry he won four County Championship and two Munster Championship titles. He played hurling with the Killarney and St Patrick's (East Kerry) teams. Over the course of his career, he won one County Hurling Championship, three Minor Championships, and four Intermediate Championships. Inter-county career Culloty first played with Kerry when he lined out in goal for the county minor hurlers when he was just 14 in a Munster Championship game with Limerick. He later joined the county minor football panel where he won a Munster Championship in 1954. That same year he was part of the Kerry junior side that won both Munster and All Ireland titles. The following year he joined the senior team. Although more known as a goalkeeper, his first game was as a forward when he came on as a sub in that year's Munster final win over Cork. He kept his place for the rest of the year finishing off with a win over Dublin in the final. He would play as an outfield player for the league campaigns in 1956, 1958 and beginning of 1959. It was in the second game of the 1959 league in a game with Galway that he first lined out in goal, a position he would keep until his retirement after the 1971 championship. He played his first championship game in 4 seasons when he lined out in the first round of the 1959 championship, where Kerry overcame Tipperary and went on to win the Munster championship after defeating Cork in the final. The semifinal was a repeat of the 1955 final as Kerry took on Dublin, the result also repeating with Kerry winning in the end. It then set up an All Ireland final with Galway, who had been All Ireland champions only three years before. Kerry ran out 3-07 to 1-04 winners, giving Culloty his second All Ireland medal. Kerry retained their Munster title in 1960 with wins over Tipperary and surprise finalists Waterford. It then set up a repeat of the previous years final with Galway in the semifinal. In this game, Kerry won on a 1-08 to 0-08 scoreline. This set up an All Ireland final with first-time finalists Down. Despite being favorites to retain their title, Down picked up a surprise victory, and their first title. Kerry started off the year by winning the National League for the second time in three years and gave Culloty his second league title. They once again retained their Munster title with wins over Clare and Cork in the Munster final, but only after a replay. This set up a repeat of the previous year's final but, once again, Down came out on top, en route to a second All Ireland in a row. While Culloty did not win an All Ireland in football, he did so in hurling, scoring 2 goals in the All Ireland Junior Hurling Championship 'home final' in Croke Park against Meath, Kerry went on to defeat London in the final proper. In 1962, Kerry and Culloty picked up a fourth Munster title in a row following wins over Waterford and Cork. This set up an All Ireland semifinal with Dublin, a team Kerry hadn't played in Championship since 1959. In the end, it was a repeat of that fixture, with Kerry the 2-12 to 0-10 winners in the end. This set up a novel pairing in the final, as Roscommon qualified. It was to be the third time the sides met in the final and the first since 1946. Going into the game, each team had won one each but, in the end, Kerry came out 1-12 to 0-06 winners, to leap-frog the Connacht team in the head-to-head and, in the process, give Culloty his third All Ireland title. 1963 started off with Culloty picking up his 3rd National League title. Wins over Tipperary and Cork meant a fifth Munster title in a row. This set up an All Ireland semifinal with Galway, a team Kerry and Culloty had dominated in the past. However, much like three years before against Down, Kerry were shocked as Galway picked up a 1-07 to 0-08 win, on the way to an All Ireland title. In 1964, his sixth Munster title in a row was picked up after wins over Tipperary and Cork. This set up a first championship meeting since 1955 with Cavan in the semifinal, with Kerry winning by 2-12 to 0-06. This set up an All Ireland final with defending champions Galway. However, for the second year in a row, victory went to the Connacht men, on a 0-15 to 0-10 scoreline. 1965 saw a seventh Munster title for Kerry, after wins over Clare and, for the first time since 1960, Cork weren't Kerry's opponents in the Munster final as they overcame Limerick. This was the first of only two meetings of the two sides during Culloty's playing career. Culloty missed out on Kerry's semifinal win over Dublin. He was back for the All Ireland final where, for the third year in a row, Kerry faced Galway and, for the third year, they were beaten, this time by 0-12 to 0-09. In 1966, Kerry were going for an eighth Munster title in a row. They started off with a win over Tipperary but lost to Cork in the final. This was Culloty's final year and was the only year not to make it outside of Munster. Culloty played no part in the league of Munster championship campaign of 1967 when Kerry lost once more to Cork in the Munster final. He played no part in the 1968 league or Munster championship. Kerry won the title, to set up a first championship meeting with first-time Leinster Champions Longford. Culloty returned to the team and they won 2-13 to 2-11. This set up an All Ireland final with Down. It was the first championship meeting between the sides since the 1961 semifinal. In the end, Down kept their 100% record against Kerry, a record that still stands today. Culloty was made Kerry captain in 1969. He led his side to their first league title since 1963, giving Culloty a fourth title. Wins over Waterford and Cork give him his 11th Munster title. The All Ireland semi set up a meeting with Mayo, the result being a one-point win, on a 0-14 to 1-10 score line for Kerry. Another novel pairing awaited in the final, as Kerry faced Offaly for the final time. In the end, Kerry were 0-10 to 0-07 winners, giving Culloty the honor of accepting the cup as captain, and a fourth All Ireland title. 1970 saw Culloty pick up his 12th and final Munster championship title, following wins over Limerick and Cork. Kerry had 13 points to spare in the semifinal against Derry, setting up an All Ireland final meeting with Meath. In a high-scoring game, Kerry were 2-19 to 0-18 winners, giving Culloty his fifth and final All Ireland medal. He also won a Munster Intermediate Hurling Championship title after overcoming Cork in the final. In what was to be his last season as a player, Culloty won a fifth National League title. Kerry began their Munster campaign with a win over Tipperary to set up a Munster final with Cork. However, Kerry and Culloty ended up on the wrong side of a 0-15 to 0-14 scoreline. During his career he played in a number of Railway Cup campaigns with Munster but did not win any titles with them. He also won two National Hurling League titles during his hurling career. Management career In 1972, a year after retiring from playing, he became manager of the Kerry team. He had mixed fortunes as a manager. In his first year in charge he won both National League and Munster titles, while again leading his side to an All Ireland final against then- champions Offaly. A 1-13 apiece draw meant that the sides would have to meet again. In the replay, Kerry were totally outclassed and lost, on what is still a record All-Ireland-final loss for a Kerry team, on a 1-19 to 0-13 scoreline. Despite National League titles in 1973-74, Culloty's side failed to make the breakthrough in Munster, losing to Cork in both years. Culloty stepped down as manager after the 1974 season, being succeeded by former teammate Mick O'Dwyer.

His popularity did not survive the change in the cultural climate in Germany after World War I, however, and after his death he was soon forgotten. However, in the 1980s interest in his work revived, and a grand retrospective exhibition in 1997 in the City Museum in Freital, Germany, duly restored his reputation as one of the masters of the Dresden art scene around 1910.This article is based mainly on the exhibition catalogue by G√ºnther from 1997, mentioned in the Bibliography section, and various articles in Deutsche Kunst und Dekoration as mentioned also in this section. I submitted this article to Rolf G√ºnther and he agreed with its contents. Trademark and artistic influences Unger was a portraitist and a landscape painter but his reputation stems from his paintings, most of them nearly life-size, of \\"beautiful women dreaming of Arcadia\\". In fact, it was always the same woman being portrayed: his wife in real life, his muse. Later, his daughter Maja came to share her mother's privileged position. The background to his \\"Arcadian woman\\" was quite often a pastoral landscape with high cypresses, a garden or a seaside scene. In his work he was influenced by some important 19th-century and contemporary artists, among who were: Puvis de Chavannes (\\"beauty as religion\\"), Gustave Moreau, Josephin P√©ladan (the androgyne type), Fernand Khnopff (sphinx-like women, although Unger omitted the lascivious eroticism of Khnopff), William Strang (a British engraver whom Unger met in 1895 in Dresden, and later visited in London) and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Other important influences were Edward Burne-Jones, Arnold B√∂cklin (especially his landscapes) and Max Klinger.(de)galerie- schueller.de, profile Most important works (and first exhibition) *Estey Orgeln (poster, 1896) *Die Muse (The Muse), International Art Exhibition Dresden, 1897 *Das Welken (The Withering), 1902 *Mutter und Kind (Mother and Child), King Albert Museum, Chemnitz, 1912 *Venezianerin (Venetian Woman), Galerie Arnold, Dresden, 1916 Early life Hans Unger was born into a lower-middle-class family in Bautzen, in the Lausitz in the southeast corner of Germany near Poland and the Czech Republic. His father quickly recognized his son's artistic talent, but since he did not think painting would be a thriving occupation for young Hans, he sent him to trade school. This was not a success and quite soon Unger became a house painter (Anstreicher). In 1887 he took up a training position as a decoration-painter in his home-town. From 1888 to 1893 he was a student in the Painting Class (Malsaal) in the Royal Dresden Court Theatre. From 1893 to 1895 he studied at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts, where his teachers were Friedrich Preller the Younger and Hermann Prell. Unger can be seen as a representative of the Dresdener Jugendstil movement, among whose members were also Sascha Schneider, Selmar Werner and Oskar Zwintscher. In 1894 he spent summer on the island Bornholm where he made a series of watercolors. In 1896 he designed a poster (Plakat) for the Dresden-based organ manufacturing company Estey, which made him internationally famous and launched his career.The Estey Orgeln poster is mentioned in http://www.all- art.org/history661_posters.html In all, he published about a dozen posters that feature for the first time his trademark of the beautiful but dreamlike and almost sleepwalking woman, a motif that was so prominent in much Art Nouveau painting. Early career In 1897 his painting Die Muse (The Muse) was immediately bought by the Gem√§ldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden. From October 1897 to March 1898 he studied at the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris where his teachers were Fleury and Lefebvre.(de)arcadja Another boost to his career was the commission to design the scenic curtain for the newly built Dresdener Centraltheater, in 1899. Unfortunately the building was destroyed during the bombing of Dresden by the Allied forces in February 1945. In 1899 he also took part in the German Art Exhibition (Deutsche Kunstausstellung) in Dresden where he had his own room, decorated with lilac walls and a black wooden rim. Among the works displayed was a Selbstbildnis im Sweater (Self Portrait in Sweater), and Abschied (Farewell), a landscape. In 1902 he became a member of the newly established German Artists' Union (Deutsche K√ºnstlerbund) and travelled to the North Sea, the Baltic, Italy and Egypt, where he made many watercolors and pastel paintings. Unger was a passionate traveler to the South all his life and the powerful colors in his work reflect this. A testimony to this trait is found in the book Reisebilder aus dem S√ºden mentioned in the bibliography. In 1905 Unger designed a mosaic for the tower of the Ernemann Reisekamera factory in Dresden, portraying a Lichtg√∂ttin (Light Goddess). The tower still exists on the Schandauerstrasse. In 1898 and 1910, Unger designed the cover illustration for issues of the magazine Jugend. He also illustrated issues of the magazine Pan.(de)munzinger.de, Hans Unger The apex Around 1910, Unger's style changed notably. His strokes become bolder; his colors lose their intensity and his choice of motif becomes increasingly monotonous. The dreamlike female figure that around the turn of the century was captivating and fresh became a clich√©. Her face had turned harsh and without expression. However, in his portraits and landscapes Unger remained as powerful as he had ever been. In 1912, the newly built City Museum in his hometown Bautzen opened and celebrated Unger by giving him his own room. He was at the apex of his fame and was called Dresden's letzter Malerf√ºrst (\\"The Last Painting Prince of Dresden\\") by the press. The outbreak of World War I in November 1914 forced many young artists to join the military and fight at the front, but Unger was already so prominent in his profession that he was spared this fate and could continue to devote himself to his art. In 1917 Unger participated in the exhibition of the Dresdner Kunstgenossenschaft (Dresden Artists Society). He designed the catalogue's cover image and featured six paintings, among them Salome and Liegende M√§dchen (Girls Lying), and six drawings. In 1918 the Dresdner Kunst Ausstellung (Dresden Art Exhibition) featured Unger with another 11 paintings and 10 drawings. attesting to his popularity and renown in the artistic community. His poster for the concerts of his friend, the composer and director Jean-Louis Nicod√©, won him a prize in England for \\"best German poster\\". A lost world In 1918, Germany lost the war, and it also lost the monarchy. The young artists, returning from the front, were disillusioned and wanted only one thing, which was Change, moving even further away from impressionism and copying reality as they had done in the years prior to World War I. Unger's world of idealized women in soothing landscapes had been overhauled by the Zeitgeist and his work was relegated to the background. Nonetheless, he was still one of the wealthiest artists in Dresden, and he continued to travel to Italy, Dalmatia, Spain, Portugal and Africa. Unger's visits to Egypt resulted in an exhibition in the Galerie Baumbach in Dresden in 1927 and in King Fuad I of Egypt becoming one of his patrons. In 1933 the S√§chsischer Kunstverein (Art Association of Saxony) organized an exhibition on the occasion of his 60th birthday. The arts journalist Felix Zimmermann wrote an honorary article on Unger in the Dresdner Neueste Nachrichten of August 25, 1932. Meanwhile, his health deteriorated. What later turned out to be a kidney disease was treated too late and Hans Unger died in his home in Loschwitz, a suburb of Dresden, on 9 August 1936. He was buried in Loschwitz Cemetery, where his grave still exists. History had certainly caught up with him. Adolf Hitler was already in power for more than three years, the economy was in the worst state of the entire 20th century and the days of Art Nouveau and fin de si√®cle were certainly over.  Renewed interest  However, the resurging interest in Jugendstil art in the 1960s brought Unger's work back to the attention of the art connoisseurs. In 1987, the City Museum in Bautzen organized an exhibition to commemorate the 125th anniversary of his birth. In 1997 a retrospective exhibition on Unger was held in the City Museum in Freital, Germany. In 2013, an exhibition in Bielefeld titled Beauty and Mystery. German symbolism featured some of his works along with artists that influenced him such as Franz von Stuck, Max Klinger and Arnold B√∂cklin.http://www.kunsthalle- bielefeld.de/index.php/ausstellungen/ruckblick/schonheit-und-geheimnisder- deutsche-symbolismus-1870-1920/?lang=en Personal life Unger married his wife Marie Antonia in 1899. She was to become his muse, his model and the main subject of his works. She is said to have been quite beautiful and the centre of attention of the many friends in the artistic circles in Dresden, especially musicians and writers, which Unger invited to his house. In 1902, Unger designed his own villa in Loschwitz. His prominence as a daring young artist and his popularity among the Dresden upper class as a portraitist had made him a wealthy man. Unger also designed the entire interior decoration himself. This however was removed during a renovation in the early 1970s. The villa, on the K√ºgelgenstrasse no. 6, still exists and offers a view on the river Elbe and, further away, on the Dresden city centre. In 1903, his only child, his daughter Maja, was born, who had clearly inherited her mother's looks. Her godfather was Sascha Schneider, a lifelong friend of Unger. After her death in 1973, Unger's estate was sold and scattered.

D. Powell for finding a local minimum of a function. The function need not be differentiable, and no derivatives are taken. The function must be a real-valued function of a fixed number of real-valued inputs. The caller passes in the initial point. The caller also passes in a set of initial search vectors. Typically N search vectors (say \\\\\\\\{s_1, \\\\dots, s_N\\\\\\\\}) are passed in which are simply the normals aligned to each axis. The method minimises the function by a bi-directional search along each search vector, in turn. The bi-directional line search along each search vector can be done by Golden-section search or Brent's method. Let the minima found during each bi-directional line search be \\\\\\\\{ x_0 + \\\\alpha_1s_1, {x}_0 + \\\\sum_{i=1}^{2}\\\\alpha_i{s}_i, \\\\dots, {x}_0 +\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\\\alpha_i{s}_i \\\\\\\\}, where {x}_0 is the initial starting point and \\\\alpha_i is the scalar determined during bi-directional search along {s}_i.

The new displacement vector (\\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\alpha_i s_i) becomes a new search vector, and is added to the end of the search vector list.

The method is useful for calculating the local minimum of a continuous but complex function, especially one without an underlying mathematical definition, because it is not necessary to take derivatives. The basic algorithm is simple; the complexity is in the linear searches along the search vectors, which can be achieved via Brent's method.

Etymology  The term bugar≈°ƒáica and bugar≈°ƒáina for song and bugariti for singing were first recorded in 1550s by Petar Hektoroviƒá and published in Fishing and Fishermen's Talk (1568), in his reference to two songs he collected from fishermen from the Adriatic island of Hvar. Juraj Barakoviƒá recorded bugarskice, while Ivan Gunduliƒá bugarkinje. In Central Croatia were sometimes named as popijevka or popevka. The form bugar≈°tica is a 19th-century invention as the contemporary Serbo-Croatian standard language does not have \\"consonantal cluster ≈°ƒá\\", being more a technical term, but since 1980s bugar≈°ƒáica is also being used in the scientific literature because it is more appropriate for the historical context. The origination and etymology are still uncertain. There exist three predominant theories regarding the etymology of bugar≈°tica: * Researchers such as Vatroslav Jagiƒá, Tomo Maretiƒá, and Matija Murko, posit that it was derived from the root bugar \\"Bulgarian\\", indicating the direction of spread of bugar≈°tica from a contact area between late medieval Bulgaria and Serbia towards the Adriatic coast. Other names, such as pjesan bugarska which some scholars interpret as \\"Bulgarian song\\",Munro Chadwick, Nora K. Chadwick (2010). The Growth of Literature. Cambridge University Press. pp. 454‚Äì5 or sarpskim naƒçinom \\"Serbian manner\\", were applied to these songs. * The second considered by scholars such as Ivan Slamnig, Ilya Golenishchev-Kutuzov, Nada Milo≈°eviƒá-ƒêorƒëeviƒá, and others, the term developed from the Latin vulgaricus or lingua vulgaris \\"common people's language\\", or carmen vulgare \\"folk song\\", denoting ballads composed in the spoken Slavic vernacular in Dalmatia, as opposed to those composed in the literary Latin. The change of the initial v into b could be due to folk etymology, associating vulgare with the similarly sounding Slavic root bugar. Slamnig also points out that vulgare was alternatively spelled as bulgare, when it referred to the Slavic language of the Adriatic Coast. * According to the third, which is partly related to the second, considered by ƒêuro Daniƒçiƒá, Vladan Nediƒá, Miroslav Pantiƒá, Josip Kekez, and others would be from verb bugariti meaning \\"sad singing\\", possibly deriving from Middle Latin bucculare and boccalone meaning to \\"start singing\\" and \\"shouting, whining\\". It was also common in Istria and the island of Krk meaning \\"loud\\" or \\"monotonal\\" singing. As it was a common term for singing nevertheless of the number of syllables Nenad Ljubinkoviƒá argued that the term is mistakenly used for long verse songs and rather proposed the term \\"songs of the long verse\\", but such a term is too general and the bugar≈°tica makes a genre of a very specific style. * Additionally, Valtazar Bogi≈°iƒá and Petar Skok proposed a relation to the Albanian, Aromanian, Turkish and South Slavic music instruments bulgari and bugarija, but such assumption is dismissed because there is no evidence the songs were performed with an instrument.  Origin  As historical events spread and reflect easily in both oral and written poetry it is problematic to directly relate their origin with historical figures of the different royal court, toponyms, and nationality, as well as at the early times did not exist today's national separatism. In the scholarship exist various theories: * Since the late 19th century some scholars argued partial (Jagiƒá, Bogi≈°iƒá) or complete (Asmus Soerensen) origin from a Serbian continental, or Hungarian controlled territory (Srijem), or medieval Bulgarian-Serbian border, and that from there spread to the Adriatic coast to the South. It is primarily based on the historical content. Mainly supported by Serbian scholars like Pavle Popoviƒá, Nada Milo≈°eviƒá-ƒêorƒëeviƒá and others, in the same fashion, Serbian literary historian Miroslav Pantiƒá, who recognized, translated and published the earliest 1497 poem from Southern Italy in 1977, described it as a Serbian poem and argued that its performers came from Serbian Despotate. However, linguistical, onomastic and historical analysis by Croatian linguist Petar ≈†imunoviƒá (1984) dismissed Pantiƒá because, among others, the language was Shtokavian-Chakavian with Ikavian accent identical to Slavomolisano dialect of Molise Croats which implies an area of origination between rivers Cetina and Neretva in Dalmatia. The theory has a lack of evidence to support the assumption the songs were sung so far in the North, of the lyrical and historical migration, and it is very doubtful that the servants from the same region Slavicized in such a fashion personal names as well as commemorated Hungarian historical figures. * In the same time Jagiƒá, Bogi≈°iƒá, Franz Miklosich, Ilya Golenishchev-Kutuzov, Josip Kekez, Petar ≈†imunoviƒá, and others argue partial or complete Western and Southern Croatian origin in Dalmatia and near Bosnia and Herzegovina, on a former territory of Chakavian (with some Kajkavian traces) and Western Shtokavian-Ikavian dialects. Jagiƒá considered that often use of terms ugrski, Ugrin and Ugriƒçiƒá (\\"Hungarian\\"), especially in Dubrovnik and Bay of Kotor, was a common political adjective for all heroes who fought against the Ottomans. * Macedonian ethnographer Krste Misirkov in the early 20th century argued that the style of this songs is a result of the Bulgarian musical influence during the Middle Ages over the Serbian and Croatian epic poetry.–ö. –ú–∏—Å–∏—Ä–∫–æ–≤. –Æ–∂–Ω–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤—è–Ω—Å–∫–∏—Ç–µ –µ–ø–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω–∏—è –∑–∞ –∂–µ–Ω–∏—Ç–±–∞—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ –∫—Ä–∞–ª –ú–∞—Ä–∫–æ —Å—Ä–µ–¥ —é–∂–Ω–∏—Ç–µ —Å–ª–∞–≤—è–Ω–∏. –û–¥–µ—Å–∞, 1909. —Å. 6.; –ö. –ú–∏—Å–∏—Ä–∫–æ–≤. –ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–∏—è—Ç –Ω–∏ –µ–ø–æ—Å –∏ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—è. - –†–∞–∑–≤–∏—Ç–∏–µ, II, –∫–Ω. 2-3, —Ñ–µ–≤—Ä—É–∞—Ä–∏-–º–∞—Ä—Ç 1919, —Å. 80.; –ö. –ú–∏—Å–∏—Ä–∫–æ–≤. –ö—Ä–∞–ª–∏ –ú–∞—Ä–∫–æ. - –ò–ª–∏–Ω–¥–µ–Ω, III, –±—Ä. 12, 25 –º–∞—Ä—Ç 1923. This hypothesis is hard to verify, as there are no records of medieval Bulgarian epic songs. Maurice Bowra argued that the sixteen-syllable line of bugar≈°tica was of Bulgarian origin \\"since the Bulgarians still use eight-syllable lines, which may be the two halves of an old sixteen-syllable\\".Prague essays: presented by a group of British historians to the Caroline University of Prague on the occasion of its six-hundredth anniversary, Robert William Seton- Watson, Clarendon Press, 1949, p. 130. * Due to feudal figures and customs some scholars argued to not have been of common folk origin yet feudal nobility. Maja Bo≈°koviƒá-Stulli in 2004 synthesis concluded that the predominant area of origin was in the South near the Adriatic coast, with a style partly recognizable in Steƒáak inscriptions, and was influenced by Latin ballad poetry as well as the content from the Latin and Hungarian historical chronicles.  History  It is considered to be older epic layer of South Slavic oral tradition which existed probably before the 15th century and disappeared by the middle of the 18th century. The earliest known poem which can be classified as bugar≈°tica was recorded in 1497 by Italian poet Rogeri de Pacienza, included in his work Lo Balzino, who was present when it was performed after a Kolo (dance) in honour to Queen Isabella del Balzo by thirty Slavs, men, women and children who had settled in the village of Gioia del Colle, Southern Italy. It tells about the imprisonment of Hungarian voivode Janko (John Hunyadi) by Despot of Serbia ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá in Smederevo Fortress, which happened in 1448. During the 16th‚Äì18th centuries all of them were collected in Dalmatia and the Bay of Kotor, with an exception in Central Croatia (with Kajkavian dialect features). First collector Petar Hektoroviƒá recorded fishermen Paskoj and Nikola singing them as a way to spend the rowing time faster. In his writing to Mik≈°a Pelegrinoviƒá, it is evident that these songs were commonly known, there was also other and older way of singing, and Hektoroviƒá even assumed those fishermen learned them from someone else. Other poets and priests who collected them are Juraj Barakoviƒá, Juraj Kri≈æaniƒá, Petar Zrinski, Nikola Ohumuƒáeviƒá, ƒêuro Matija≈°eviƒá, Julije Baloviƒá, Andrija Zmajeviƒá, and Josip Betondiƒá, among others. They were published in the late 19th century by Franz Miklosich, Alexander Hilferding, and most completely by Valtazar Bogi≈°iƒá in Narodne pjesme iz starijih, najvi≈°e primorskih zapisa (1878), about 85 bugar≈°tica songs in total. By the 19th century bugar≈°tica vanished as a from, most probably due to popularity of younger epic songs in decasyllabic meter.  Characteristics  The songs are sung in long verses of mostly fifteen and sixteen syllables with a caesura after the seventh and eighth syllable, respectively. Sometimes have an addition, mostly in six syllables. Although some bugar≈°tica's content is closely related to historiography, especially to the history of Mauro Orbini's Il regno de gli Slavi (1601) and Ludovik Crijeviƒá Tuberon's Writings on the Present Age (Commentaria temporum suorum) (1603), they are generally deemed to be oral songs, transmitted orally. The bugar≈°tica's themes vary not only in the scope of this type but also in respect of decasyllabic songs. Although mostly have epic and heroic themes, its structures tend to be of ballad poetry, which includes summarized storytelling, with a sudden beginning of an action, with dialogue and graded repetition. In the scholarship, some like Milovan Gavazzi and Bogi≈°iƒá viewed the sixteen syllables to be composed of two octosyllables and hence was argued relationship with octosyllabic songs. Other scholars were rather critical of such a metric approach and rather considered that bugar≈°tica should be viewed as one unity. Nevertheless, the comparison of a bugar≈°tica, provisionally titled \\"Kraljeviƒá Marko i brat mu Andrija≈°\\", written by Hektoroviƒá in 1556 with three songs by Burgenland Croats found almost identical similarity in the balladic intonation, use of diminutives, and content. The similarity with them was also found in a song from the islands of Susak, ≈Ωirje, and city of Dubrovnik. Bo≈°koviƒá-Stulli deduced that such songs were widespread on Croatian territory, emerged from an older stratum of folk poetry, and with some hinterland influences partly changed and formed in Dalmatia. The main themes are about Christian-Ottoman conflicts (including battles of Kosovo in 1389 and 1448, sometimes mixed together), events regarding Croatian-Hungarian, Bosnian and Serbian history and feudal lords from 14th-16th centuries, and Montenegrin coastal battles in Perast and Bay of Kotor in the 17th century. It has typical South Slavic epic poetry heroes, from Serbian figures Marko Kraljeviƒá, ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá, Vuk Grgureviƒá, Jak≈°iƒá brothers and possibly Milo≈° Obiliƒá, Hungarian figures Sibinjanin Janko (Janos Hunyadi), Sekula or Ivan Zeker (Sz√©kely), Svilojeviƒá (Michael Szil√°gyi), Matthias Corvinus and John Corvinus, Croatian figures Ivan Karloviƒá, Nikola ≈†ubiƒá Zrinski, Petar Berislaviƒá, to local Dubrovnik and Bokelji heroes. However, the poems are often focused on the secondary participants of these events, emphasizing human experience and interaction. They conserved archaic feudal period customs, manners, etiquette, descriptions of attire, weapon, mythological dragon or snake and vila and so on. They integrate different cultural and ethnic layers and represent significant monument of South Slavic folklore.

Addax Petroleum was an international gas and oil production and exploration company mainly focused on the Middle East, the North Sea and Africa. Since 1994, the company become one of the largest oil producers in West Africa. History Addax Petroleum was originally part of the Addax & Oryx Group of Companies (AOG) which was founded in 1987. In 1989 AOG embarked on an ambitious expansion programme with the aim of becoming a vertically integrated oil company focused on the African continent. This led to the creation of Addax Petroleum in 1994 by Marc Lorenceau, a partner from the AOG trading group. Addax's initial steps in the upstream business was the acquisition of the Espoir field offshore Ivory Coast that had been relinquished by Phillips in 1988. Four years later, Addax Petroleum sold its remaining equity in the Espoir field to CNR (Canadian Natural Resources). In 1998, as oil prices were dropping, Ashland Oil Nigeria was for sale as the company wanted to leave the country's upstream sector. Perenco appeared to be the best bidder for Ashland's assets. However, the bidding process was overturned and these assets were eventually awarded to Addax Petroleum for the official amount of twenty million US dollars. After the tragic death of Mr. Lorenceau in a ski accident in late 2001, Jean Claude Gandur became the company's Chairman and CEO until the takeover by the Sinopec Group in August 2009.

Eventually, Addax Petroleum agreed early July to pay 31 million Swiss francs to settle the charges with the Geneva justice department. In August, Addax Petroleum announced the shutting of its offices in Geneva, Houston and Aberdeen, thus releasing 174 people. The closure of these offices is expected to be completed on December 10 and fully effective on December 31st, 2017. Addax Petroleum hydrocarbon production The company's average daily oil production for 2011 was 140,000 bbl/d. Year-to-date average daily oil production as of Q3 2012 was per day (this figure does not take the Talisman-Sinopec Energy UK nor the OML 138 production figures into account). As part of its \\"Vision 500\\", Addax Petroleum was aiming at reaching an average daily production of of oil by 2015. Addax Petroleum has never been able to get anywhere close to that production figure. Addax Petroleum is currently the 2nd largest oil producer in Cameroon, the 4th largest in Gabon. Addax Petroleum used to be the 5th largest in Nigeria. The TTOPCO Joint Venture company (together with Genel Energy) was the largest oil producer in Iraqi Kurdistan. In 2017 TTOPCO announced a $181-million writedown on the asset value after the auditor McDaniel in February 2017 had evaluated its reserves at , compared to at 31 December 2015. Addax Petroleum purchased 49% of Talisman UK in 2012 to form the Talisman-Sinopec Energy UK Ltd Joint Venture company, that became Repsol- Sinopec Resources UK in July 2016 and is the 4th largest UK oil producer. The Talisman UK production, that averaged of oil per day in 2012, continued its decline to be around of oil per day in 2017. Asset growth Addax Petroleum has a dominantly onshore and offshore brown producing-fields asset base located in Nigeria, Gabon, Cameroon and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, as well as the UK North Sea's Continental Shelf. Corporate culture Addax Petroleum's motto states, \\"Each step makes a difference and difference is our strength\\". The company motto reflects the fact that Addax Petroleum puts strong emphasis on cross-cultural management, as the company brings together employees from many different cultural backgrounds under Chinese management.

In 2009, a multifaceted research project was conducted by several veterinarians from the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign, College of Veterinary Medicine.University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign, College of Veterinary Medicine Under the direction of Dr. Stuart Clark-Price, immobilization and anesthesia methods for tigers were assessed in order to optimize current protocols and maximize animal safety under anesthesia. During these procedures, veterinary ophthalmologists gathered routine measurements on the tigers' eyes to determine what is normal in this species and establish a basis for treatment on tigers with eye diseases or to improve current therapies. Dental examinations were also performed by The Peter Emily International Veterinary Dental Foundationhttps://www.peteremilyfoundation.org to determine the current condition of each tiger‚Äôs teeth and the potential need for future dental care. Any needed dental treatments were performed by board-certified veterinary dentists pro bono. Other information including normal blood value and anti- body levels of different diseases was evaluated to improve care of these tigers as well as global care for this species.

This was allegedly a case of human error. The unidentified 21-year-old woman was airlifted to Wishard Memorial Hospital and was in critical, but non-life-threatening condition. As a result of the incident, the Indiana Occupational Safety and Health Administration conducted an inspection and in November 2013 fined the center $56,000 for ‚Äúknowing‚Äù violations and $13,000 for ‚Äúserious‚Äù violations, including dangerous conditions likely to cause death or physical harm to employees. Three days after the incident Ann Marie Houser, an Animal Care Inspector from the USDA, visited the center to investigate. Houser noticed an issue with the enclosure door, a 4 to 6 inch gap, which the facility benefactor, Taft, had attempted to fix with the use of a piece of rebar. It was Houser's finding that this repair prohibited the cage from functioning efficiently or quickly in an emergency.

E. van Vogt - The Wizard of Linn' Plot An alien starship has entered the solar system sometime in the Sixth Century of the Thirteenth Millennium A. D. The ship appears to belong to the Riss, an alien race who had come to Sol millennia ago and destroyed the thriving human civilization. Now the descendants of the survivors, living in a medieval society with spaceships, must face the threat again. One of those is Jerrin, Lord Advisor of the Linnan Empire. Jerrin is annoyed that his brother, the mutant atom priest Clane, knew about the Riss incursion before he did and is more annoyed when Clane recommends an attack on the Riss ship, one that is guaranteed to fail. The attack does indeed fail, but Clane, Jerrin, and their associates are protected by a glassy-looking aetherial sphere that Clane controls mentally and that absorbs energy. For his second attack Clane sneaks aboard the Riss ship and uses the sphere to eliminate the crew. Taking over the ship, Clane flies it to his estate. There he discovers that Jerrin has been assassinated, poisoned by his wife Lilidel, who was concerned that her son Calaj was to be disinherited from the Lord Advisorship. Worse, Clane discovers that his magic sphere has been stolen by followers of Czinczar, a barbarian from Europa who recently tried to conquer the Empire of Linn. Calaj becomes Lord Advisor and Clane convinces him to sign a document, which he does without reading it. Lilidel is incensed: though the document appears to strengthen Calaj, she is suspicious, especially knowing that Clane has disappeared. Then the Riss arrive. Clane has taken part of his army along with Czinczar and his army aboard the captured Riss ship, which he has renamed Solar Star, and has headed out on a one-year journey to a star sixty-five light-years from Sol. On arrival they discover two Earth-like planets revolving about their common center of mass as they go around their sun. The planets are occupied by humans, but Clane and his crew are shocked to discover that those people can teleport themselves and other things at will and that they have a peaceful trading relationship with the Riss. During the visit Clane and his crew engage and destroy a Riss battleship. Then, using star maps retrieved from the wreckage, Clane takes the Solar Star on a three-month voyage to a Riss solar system. Clane and his army establish a bridgehead on the Riss planet and fend off a Riss attack. After the attack the Terrans discover humans living in vast artificial caverns and Clane discovers that they have another aetherial sphere, which he controls with his thoughts. Taking the sphere with them, Clane and his men reboard the Solar Star and return to Earth. Clane quickly re-establishes himself on Earth and takes over the government, using the document that Calaj so carelessly signed. He sends Lilidel and Calaj into exile and then employs the aetherial sphere in a new way to defeat the Riss. References *A.

She is known as the heroic woman who helped her father's resistance at Oshi Castle against Toyotomi Hideyoshi's army during the Siege of Odawara. After the war, she became one of the wives of Hideyoshi.Narita-ki, 272p-274p. She was known for her bravery and beauty.

Mitsunari started to build a large embankment, and completed this embankment in a week. He placed his headquarter at the top of old tomb near the castle, and ordered to pour water into the castle. In a moment Oshi castle was filled with water, and inside people had to evacuate to higher place. The moats around the castle rejected the water attack. The embarkaments built by Toyotomi's men were used against them. Kaihime broke the dikes near the castle, causing massive damage to the Toyotomi army. Owing to lack of foresight and planning, Mitsunari troops was devastated by the water attack. ÂøçÂüé Âüã„ÇÇ„Çå„ÅüÂè§Âüé Kai was said to have volunteered to rout the remaining soldiers, donning armor and riding on horseback with 200 men. When Ishida was reinforced by Sanada Masayuki, Sanada Yukimura and Asano Nagamasa, she was said to have slain the Sanada retainer, Miyage Takashige, in battle, taking his head as her trophy. Her accomplishments gave a huge boost to Narita army morale and forced Mitsunari to retreat, reporting his failure to Hideyoshi. Mitsunari has been ridiculed among warlord, to this day, the long strait where the Oshi incident occurred is also known as the \\"Ishida Tsutsumi\\". The Oshi castle was defended with a small number of soldiers and peasants, only fell when Hojo Ujimasa was defeated in Odawara. When Odawara Castle surrendered, Kaihime's father also chose to do the same with the hope of ending warfare. She and her father were put under Gam≈ç Ujisato's care for a time. Sometime when her father was away, an internal rebellion was caused by Hamada Shugen and his younger brother (historical records suggest that the revolt was actually started by Ujinaga's brothers). During this time, Kai's mother-in-law was killed. As soon as she heard about the incident, Kai brandished a sword and sought to end the rebels. She slew the instigator and two followers, effectively repressing the bloodshed. Hideyoshi heard of her bravery and married her. As a result, her father became one of Hideyoshi's trusted generals.

Washington Pediatric Hospital Mt. Washington Pediatric Hospital is a 102-bed non-profit children's hospital set in the scenic neighborhood of Mt. Washington in Baltimore that provides long-term care for children with complex health problems. MWPH is jointly owned by Johns Hopkins Medical System and University of Maryland Medical System. Funded by patient revenue and private charitable donations, Mt. Washington Pediatric Hospital is a comprehensive sub-acute care facility for children from birth to young adult; MWPH provides transitional and support care for a variety of conditions, including premature birth, serious and chronic illness, traumatic injury, ADHD, autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, childhood obesity, diabetes, feeding problems, among others. Mt. Washington Pediatric Hospital also has a unit at Prince George's Hospital Center in Cheverly, Maryland. MWPH accreditations include Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities and The Joint Commission. History In 1922, Johns Hopkins social worker Hortense Kahn Eliasberg founded Happy Hills Convalescent Home at a home off Falls Road. On July 10, 1922, Happy Hills welcomed its first patient. During The Great Depression, Happy Hills appealed for state aid. The depressed economy left a large amount of real estate available, so trustees purchased The Whitelock Estate on West Rogers Avenue in Mt. Washington where the hospital sits today. On October 22, 1930, Happy Hills Home for Convalescent Children was dedicated. Dr. Wilfred H. Smith, Director of Johns Hopkins Hospital, wrote to trustees: ‚ÄúHappy Hills has met a real need in Baltimore. I congratulate you on your success and upon the increase in your facilities. I prophesy that the future will demand of you still further expansion.‚Äù In the 1940s, the work load at the hospital placed further demands on staff, particularly nurses, who influence trustees to hire the first volunteer coordinator. Happy Hills celebrated its 20th anniversary in 1942. In that year, more than 2,700 children received care. The original founder, Hortense Kahn Eliasberg was honored in a presentation by Union Trust Company for her efforts and contribution to the health of the children of Baltimore. Richard F. Cleveland, the eldest son of the late U.S. President Grover Cleveland and last original founding member becomes Board President in 1952. With the prevalence of polio, Mt. Washington cared for many patients admitted with the devastating disease. Happy Hills answered the patients‚Äô needs with specialty areas of medicine, therapy, nutrition, education, and recreation. Improved technology meant the addition of electrocardiograms, x-rays and laboratories. Happy Hills celebrated its 40th anniversary in 1964, having provided care for over 6,000 children. The Baltimore Sun noted ‚Äúits likeness to a special pediatric hospital rather than a convalescent home.‚Äù In 1964 Happy Hills also began the journey to its name today. Starting with the changing of the name to Happy Hills Hospital in 1964, then in 1975 to Mt. Washington Pediatric Hospital. Mt. Washington Pediatric Hospital gained certification from The Joint Commission in 1979. Shortly after Joint Commission certification, the hospital received accreditation from Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities(CARF). Mt. Washington Pediatric Hospital became the first children‚Äôs hospital in Maryland accredited for comprehensive inpatient rehab, infant and early childhood development and respite care. On September 26, 1986, groundbreaking began for the new, expanded hospital. A few years later on September 15, 1989, Mayor Kurt Schmoke declared it ‚ÄúMt. Washington Pediatric Hospital Day‚Äù in Baltimore. The Outpatient Care Center opened in November 1990, providing a variety of outpatient services including orthopedic, adaptive equipment, and Down Syndrome clinics. In 1996, the hospital opened its sleep clinic which continues today, assisting with the diagnoses of a variety of pediatric issues. In 1997, a new unit opened at Prince George‚Äôs Hospital Center. In 2000, the new outpatient center opened and was called the Jack & Mae Rosenberg Center for Pediatric Respiratory Medicine. Outpatient and Day Feeding Programs began to assist with feeding disorders in 2001. In 2005, the innovative Weigh Smart¬Æ program was added as a multi- disciplinary and holistic approach to pediatric weight management. It was followed in (2009) by Weigh Smart Jr. ¬Æ designed for weight management of toddlers and preschool-aged children and also involving medical, nutritional, educational and behavioral components. In 2006, MWPH entered into a unique joint ownership with University of Maryland Medical System and Johns Hopkins Medicine. The Center for Pediatric & Adolescent Rehabilitation (CPAR) renovations were completed. It included a colorful Baltimore street theme, flat screen TVs, mobile computers, a new play area and transitional apartment for families. In addition to the CPAR renovations, a modern and larger rehab pool was installed in the Rehabilitation wing. In 2010, the Concussion Clinic opened, along with the Balance Clinic, including the new state-of-the-art NeuroCom¬Æ equipment. In addition, the Community Advocacy program began with the goal of reaching out to more residents of the Baltimore community to increase awareness of current health issues important to families. In 2011, MWPH was recognized as one of 217 hospitals in the United States receiving Stage 6 HIMMS designation for its use of electronic medical records.HIMSS Analytics Ratings Website, Stage 6 Hospitals Programs Operated The hospital has been recognized for establishing one of the first programs in the region addressing childhood obesity.TheWBALChannel.com, \\"Program Aims To Keep Weight Off Kids,\\" July 13, 2006, Other programs include:\\"Programs and Services at Mt.

Anton Chekhov was her brother.  Biography  Maria Pavlovna Chekhova was born on August 31, 1863 in the city of Taganrog. She entered the Mariinskaya Girls Gymnasium in 1872. After the family's bankruptcy in 1876, she moved with the family to Moscow where she graduated from the Filaretovski Eparkhial School for Women in 1884. From 1886 to 1904 she read lectures on history and geography in Rzhevskaya's private gymnasium for girls. In the 1890s she studied art at Stroganovka. In 1903 she was the recipient of a gold medal on the Saint Stanislaus ribbon for assiduity in education. After the death of Anton Chekhov, she dedicated her life to the collection and publication of the literary heritage of her brother. In 1914 Maria Chekhova donated the personal belongings of Anton Chekhov to the Chekhov Museum in Taganrog, and was present at the inauguration of the Chekhov Library designed by Chekhov's friend Fyodor Schechtel. From 1922 to 1957 she was the director of the Chekhov Museum in Yalta. In 1935 Maria Chekhova and Olga Knipper visited the birth city of Chekhov, Taganrog, to participate in the events commemorating the 75th anniversary of Anton Chekhov's birth.

These Separatists or English Dissenters were religious refugees who had fled England to Amsterdam in 1608 and moved to Leiden the next year. They lived and worked in that city for about 12 to 20 years. In 1620, their emigration began. They left Leiden by canal, going to Delfshaven where they embarked on the Speedwell, which took them to Southampton. But the Speedwell proved leaky and had to be sold, so they transferred to the Mayflower. The Mayflower undertook the famous voyage to New England in 1620 alone. In the 19th century the colonists' first harvest festival after their arrival at Plymouth Colony was identified as the origin of the annual Thanksgiving celebration in the United States. Description The Leiden American Pilgrim Museum is housed in a building dating to about 1365‚Äì1370. The house is located at Beschuitsteeg 9, next to the bell tower of the Hooglandse Kerk church. The museum is operated by the Leiden American Pilgrim Museum Foundation and is open to the public.Website of the Leiden American Pilgrim Museum The museum presents extensive information about Pilgrim life in Leiden, together with the history of the medieval house itself. In the museum, a collection of furniture, books, and other material from Pilgrim times illuminates the lives of these people in England, Leiden, and New England. The museum illustrates its Pilgrim narrative with a collection of 16th- and 17th-century maps and engravings by Gerard Mercator, Adriaen Pietersz. van de Venne, and others. Additionally, one room of the museum retains its interior from the 14th century and is furnished with pre- Reformation material, reflecting the original use of the house as a residence of priests from the Hooglandsekerk across the street. In 2009, the 400-year anniversary of the Pilgrims' arrival in Leiden was marked with an exhibition and the publication of the book Strangers and Pilgrims, Travellers and Sojourners - Leiden and the Foundations of Plymouth Plantation. In 2011 the museum coordinated efforts to install a bronze memorial on the ruins of Leiden's Vrouwekerk, commemorating the history of the church and its connections with colonists of Plymouth Colony and New Netherland. The museum has published several books since then, including Plymouth Colony's Private Libraries (rev.ed. 2018). Two books mark 2020: New Light on the Old Colony - Plymouth, the Dutch Context of Toleration, and Patterns of Pilgrim Commemoration (Brill); and Intellectual Baggage - The Pilgrims and Plymouth Colony, Ideas of Influence (LAPM, available from Lulu Publishing).

Born into a Lancashire family \\"of great antiquity\\", he was the son of Samuel Whalley of Weddington Hall, Warwickshire, and was educated at Clare Hall, Cambridge, gaining his bachelor's degree in 1822 and master's in 1825. In 1827 he was knighted, at which date he was living in Devon. Member of parliament for Marylebone By the 1830s Whalley was living in the St John's Wood area of the parish of St Marylebone, a rapidly developing suburb of London. In 1832 Whalley sought to be nominated as a candidate for the newly enfranchised constituency of Marylebone, London. There was opposition to his candidacy as he was virtually unknown in the area. Questions were also raised about the manner in which he had obtained his knighthood, which was felt to have been in exchange for supporting the election of the Tory, Sir Nicholas Tindal as MP for Cambridge University. Although he failed to be selected on this occasion, a by-election occurred in the following year when one of the sitting members of parliament resigned. He was successfully nominated, and he described himself as \\"not backed by either church or aristocracy but... the representative of industry\\". He promised to be a \\"pure and independent\\" member, and set out his political views: he was in favour of \\"a rigid system of economy in all branches of the state\\" and \\"a revision of the system of tithes, and the appropriation of the surplus revenues of the church to the education of the people\\". He also advocated the abolition of slavery, reduction of taxation, destruction of monopolies, a secret ballot, and a three-year parliamentary term. The by-election was held on 20 March 1833, and Whalley secured a convincing win over his Tory opponent. He characterised his election as the \\"proud aristocracy of the country conquered by the will of the people\\". He was re-elected at the next general election in 1835. He was a strong supporter of the reforming Municipal Corporations Bill, attacking the attempts of the House of Lords to weaken the legislation. In 1837 he was again returned as member for Marylebone. However, a petition was lodged against his election. In February 1838 an election court declared his election null and void, as he had not been qualified to be a candidate due to an \\"insufficient estate\\". Whalley did not contest another election. Marriages and death Whalley was twice married. In 1830 he married Amelia Webb who died in 1835. His second marriage was to the Hon. Harriet Rose Trench, of Moate and Woodlawn, County Galway, Ireland in 1853. In his later years, he lived in Nice, France, where he died 3 February 1883.

The Avashyaka-churni (dated between Samvat 650 and 750=593‚Äì693 CE) describes: There was twelve years long famine which resulted in the monks moving to the coast. When the famine ended, they gathered at Pataliputra. They gathered the sacred knowledge and put together the eleven Angas but could not gather the Ditthivada (Drstivada). Bhadrabahu who knew the fourteen Purvas was then in Nepal. The sangha sent emissaries to him and informed to come and teach Dittivada. He refused to come citing that he had undertaken a practise Mahaprana. The emissaries returned and informed the sangha. The sangha sent emissaries again and asked, \\"What is the punishment for someone who disobeys an order of the sangha?\\" He replied \\"That one is to be expelled.\\" He added, \\" Do not expel me, send intelligent [students], I will teach them.\\" Hemchandra's Parishishtaparvan, probably based on Avashyaka-churni; also known as Sthaviravali (stories on the lives of elders or Jain patriarchs), contains detailed information about the council and how the knowledge of the Purvas was lost.Roy, Ashim Kumar (1984).

Mathura Council and Vallabhi Council I The second councils were held simultaneously at Mathura (now in Uttar Pradesh, India) under auspices of Skandila and at Vallabhi (now in Gujarat, India) under auspices of Nagarjuna to continue the transmission of sacred knowledge after famines. Vallabhi Council II The Vallabhi Council was convened by Svetambara Jain monks at Vallabhi (now in Bhavnagar district, Gujarat, India) to reduce down to writing sacred texts (Jain Agama) that had so far been transmitted orally. The council was presided by Devarddhigani Kshamashramana.

Hemchandra's Parishishtaparvan (dated Vikram Samvat 1216‚Äì1229) states the Pataliputra council was held in 160 AV. Nandisutra by Devavachaka mentions Skandila and Nagarjuna in Sthaviravali (list of elders) who had organised the sacred texts. It is demonstrated by Jambuvijaya that the text was known to Mallavadin in the fifth century. So the earlier version of it must be older than that. Nandisutra-churni which comments on it is dated 676 CE. So it is established that Skandila and Nagarjuna existed before 676 CE. The following sources mentions them in the list of elders but continues the older accounts: # Jinadasagani, Nandisutra-curni (676 CE) (plus the Ayara- and Dasasrutaskandha- curnis). # Haribhadra (700‚Äì770 CE) Laghuvrtti on Nandisutra. # Silakka (9th century CE) Ayarattka. # Santyacarya Vadivetala (d. Samvat 1096 [1039]?), Sisyahita on Uttaradhyayana. # Hemachandra (1088‚Äì1172 CE), Yogashastra commentary. # Malayagiri (c. 1093‚Äì1193 CE) tika on the Prakirnaka entitled Joisakarandaga. The Kalpasutra (Kalpasutra, Jinacaritra, section 148) mentions redaction dates of 980 AV or 993 AV but does not mentions places or persons.

Early life Farhad Aliyev received his school education at Alar village in 1970-1980 where he was born. Having completed his secondary education with an honors diploma, in 1980 he received admission to Azerbaijan State Institute of Civil Engineering (ASICE). Farhad Aliyev graduated from ASICE in 1985 and started to work in Jalilabad district. In 1985-87 he served in the Soviet army. During his education and military service, Farhad Aliyev actively participated in public works. He was elected Deputy Chairman of the Student Union at ASICE and received several awards for exemplary service in the army. He is married and has two children. Political career Besides public activities, Farhad Aliyev worked in several state positions during 1985-1990. At that time he headed a department in the Central Committee of the Youth Organization of Azerbaijan Republic, which played an important role in the political-public life of Azerbaijan. In 1990-1997 he headed several private companies functioning in the field of tourism, trade, construction, production. He was a member of the Political Council of the ruling New Azerbaijan Party until his arrest. In 1997 he was appointed Deputy Minister of Trade and after a while‚Äìthe Minister of Trade. At this post, Farhad Aliyev undertook serious reforms for development of the private sector, simplification of export-import transactions, and liberalization of trade in general. In 1999-2001, holding the post of Minister of State Property, Farhad Aliyev took several successful steps towards creation of a unified register system of state property, re-vitalization of the functioning of institutions that were opened for privatization, securing transparency in the privatization process, and attracting foreign companies to the privatization process besides Azerbaijani citizens. In 2001, by a decree of the President of Azerbaijan, Ministries of Economy, Trade and State Property, Committee against Monopolization and for Assistance to Entrepreneurship, and State Agency for Foreign Investments were united in one state organization‚ÄìMinistry of Economic Development and Farhad Aliyev was appointed the head of the Ministry. Farhad Aliyev openly criticized monopolies, abuse of power by state officials, the corrupt court system, etc., and emphasized these problems‚Äô being obstacles on Azerbaijan‚Äôs state building and development processes. In his post he organised reforms in government administration; the abolition of government structures with parallel functions, simplification of government oversight, strengthening anti- monopolization measures, infrastructural improvements, minimizing economic dependency on oil and the development of small and medium enterprises, development of foreign economic relations, in particular, broadening cooperation with international finance institutions. On the eve of parliamentary elections in Azerbaijan, on October 19, 2005, Farhad Aliyev was detained in his office at the Ministry of Economic Development to the Ministry of National Security (MNS). After being kept there for a few hours, he was told that he was dismissed from his post and detained as a suspect with charges on coup d‚Äôetat attempt.Guliyev, Elton. \\"Farhad Aliyev's Biography.\\" Farhad Aliyev's Case On 19 October 2005, Farhad Aliyev was arrested under fabricated charges of coup d‚Äô√©tat because of his campaign against monopolies, corruption and activities towards elimination of barriers for the development of private sector. The Ministry of National Security (MNS) presented no grounded evidence in regard to the coup d‚Äô√©tat charges. By instruction of MNS, domestic courts, kept Farhad Aliyev in pre-trial detention for 2 years, and then illegally sentenced him for 10 years. On 9 November 2010, having considered Farhad Aliyev's application (#37138/06) the European Court of Human Rights, adopted a judgement on violation of Articles 5 ¬ß 1 (illegal arrest), 5 ¬ß 3 (illegal detention), 5 ¬ß 4 (unfair court investigation and illegal extension of detention periods), and 6 ¬ß 2 (violation of the presumption of innocence) of the Convention. Based on this Judgement, the State has paid EUR 16,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, and EUR 25,000 in respect to the costs and expenses. Amnesty On 14 October 2013, Farhad Aliyev was released from prison by a pardon decree signed by the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev. Thus, he is entitled to fully use, without any obstacles, all the rights, liberties and privileges given to the citizens in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan.

It is the successor to the Toyota 87C and the predecessor to the Toyota 88C-V. Like other Toyota-powered sports prototypes of the era, it was designed and built by Dome. The 88C is an evolution of the 87C, both models sharing the same chassis number designation. The 88Cs competed in the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship, the World Sports-Prototype Championship, and the North American Camel GT Championship. Racing history All Japan Sports Prototype Championship The 88C made its debut in the 1988 All Japan Sports Prototype Championship, with a two-cars program fielded by Toyota Team Tom's achieving two fifth places as best results (Suzuka 500 km and Suzuka 1000 km). Le Mans Two 88Cs were entered by Toyota Team Tom's at the 1988 24 Hours of Le Mans. Both cars completed the event with the car of drivers Geoff Lees, Masanori Sekiya, and Kaoru Hoshino finishing in 12th, while the second car was 24th. Toyota returned to Le Mans in with one 88C joining two newer 89C-Vs. None of the three cars finished the race. World Sports-Prototype Championship Apart from the 1988 24 Hours of Le Mans and the 1988 1000 km of Fuji (also valid as final round of the 1988 JSPC), the 88C made a final WSPC appearance early in the 1989 season when Toyota Team Tom's entered a lone car at Dijon-Prenois while awaiting their newer 89C-Vs. The 88C finished in fourth in the hands of Geoff Lees and Johnny Dumfries. Camel GT Championship In 1989 Toyota and All American Racers entered the GTP category of IMSA's Camel GT Championship. One car was designed by AAR and entered as the Eagle HF89, while the second entry was a modified 88C. Both were powered by same turbocharged inline-4 engine and produced approximately 600 horsepower. The 88C-based car made its debut at the 1989 Daytona 24 Hours race but retired from the event. Due to troubles with the HF89 car, the team concentrated its efforts on the 88C throughout the rest of the season. After the completion of the season AAR concentrated their efforts on the HF89 and the latter Mk.III. The best result was a second place at San Antonio and two pole positions at Road Atlanta and Lime Rock.

It is intended to supplement the UK State Pension, or to replace it (for example, if the claimant did not meet the conditions to claim a State Pension). It was introduced in the UK in 2003 by Gordon Brown, then Chancellor of the Exchequer. It has been subject to a number of changes over its existence, but has the core aim of lifting retired people of limited means out of poverty. Eligibility may be estimated on a government website. Original core elements The scheme was introduced to replace the Minimum Income Guarantee, which had been introduced in 1997, also by Gordon Brown. This combined the existing applicable amount (of benefit) in Income Support, together with the Pensioner Premium, which was itself substantially increased; these changes gave the impression of a new, more generous benefit package aimed at pensioners. Pension Credit has two elements: *Guarantee Credit is an income based benefit which is paid if the income of the applicant and partner (plus a notional income from savings) is below a certain level (¬£173.75 per week for a single person and ¬£265.20 per week for a couple in 2020/21). The minimum age for claiming is rising in line with the increase in women's retirement age (see State Pension age). By September 2020 the minimum age for claiming will be 66. *Savings Credit is an inverse means-tested benefit; the higher the individual's private pension income, the more they receive in Savings Credit, up to a certain limit. This element is available once the applicant or their partner reaches 65. Savings Credit is designed to \\"reward\\" people who saved for their pension during their working life (and so provide a taper to Guarantee Credit). It therefore provides additional benefit to retired people who are not necessarily well-off, but do have savings or a personal pension, and may not qualify for the full Guarantee Credit. Savings Credit is available to people who reached the state pension age before 6 April 2016. The maximum weekly amount of Savings Credit for 2020/21 was ¬£13.97 for a single person, ¬£15.62 for a couple. The values of Guarantee Credit and Savings Credit are automatically uprated each year, in line with inflation, as are the basic State Pension and Second State Pension (S2P). However, they are uprated by different inflation measures: *Retail Price Index (RPI) : basic State Pension, *Consumer Price Index (CPI) : Second State Pension *Increase in Average Earnings : Guarantee Credit, Savings Credit The net, deliberate, effect of these differences is to make the total combined impact gradually converge, over about 40 years, to an eventual situation where the total benefit is around ¬£170 a week, whatever an individual's circumstance. Consequently, the Coalition government proposed replacing this complex system with a single flat-rate pension of about ¬£170 per week. Savings Credit, which would be abolished by the flat-rate pension policy, is currently only claimed by around 1% of eligible individuals, and few people of eligible age are aware of its existence. As an interim measure, the Coalition government changed the uprating system, so that higher levels of income would be obtained automatically, instead of via Savings Credit: *basic State Pension : a triple lock ‚Äì whichever is larger of **CPI, or **the increase in Average Earnings, or **2.5% *Guarantee Credit : the amount necessary to remain below the basic State Pension by the same cash amount *Savings Credit : reduced by the amount necessary to cover the funding for the increase in Guarantee Credit, above where it would be under the original uprating scheme Passported assistance with Council Tax Anyone who was in receipt of the Guarantee Credit part of Pension Credit was also eligible for full Council Tax Benefit, which covered the cost of their Council Tax bill. This rule was abolished in 2013, since Council Tax Benefit itself was abolished. Instead, councils are now legally required to introduce different rates of benefit for certain categories of people, known as Council Tax Reductions (marketed by many councils as Council Tax Support). For pensioners in particular, the Council Tax rate must be set to zero if they are in receipt of Guarantee Credit, maintaining the same level of support. Assistance with rent Anyone who was in receipt of the Guarantee Credit part of Pension Credit was also eligible for full Housing Benefit. This could be a significant amount, ensuring that a retired person in this position has their rent paid in full. However, the Coalition government proposed to change this rule in a substantial manner by abolishing Housing Benefit. It was intended that from October 2014, Pension Credit would gain a new core element for Housing costs comparable with the Housing Element of Universal Credit, for working-age benefit claimants. The Housing element would be based on Local Housing Allowance, in a similar manner to Housing Benefit, but payments would be incorporated within Pension Credit, rather than being a separate benefit claimed from the local council. It is not clear when, or if, this plan will be implemented. Impact of disabilities As with Universal Credit, there is an additional Element available for people suffering from certain levels of disability. The additional amount is called Extra Amount for Severe Disability and amounts to ¬£53.65 per week (in 2010/11 prices); as with most elements of Pension Credit, it is added to the core amount, and the whole thing is paid as a single weekly lump sum. The Qualification criteria is relatively simple ‚Äì the applicant, and/or their partner must be in receipt of: *Attendance Allowance (a benefit only available to people of pension age) *Disability Living Allowance (a benefit only available to people below pension age). To qualify, this benefit (DLA) must be being received at the middle or higher rate. *Personal Independence Payment (the new replacement for DLA, for claimants of working age; within a few years, DLA will only be for children). The rules are complex and there are exceptions; for example, no-one in the household must be claiming Carer's allowance for looking after the disabled individual (otherwise they would be being paid twice for the same thing). The government encourages people interested in claiming this element to contact the Pension, Disability and Carers Service via Gov.uk, or an agency with expertise in benefits, such as the Citizens Advice Bureau, or a respected charity like Age UK. Take up According to Age UK more than a third of those entitled to claim Pension Credit fail to do so based on latest estimates of take-up from 2009/10. Up to 1.6 million of pensioners on average were missing out on an extra ¬£1,700 a year.

Building The 1880 Federalization of Buenos Aires was followed by a boom in foreign trade and European immigration, and in 1890, Mayor Francisco P. Bollini commissioned the construction of a new city hall. The building would replace what had been the city government's offices since 1860 - the second floor of police headquarters; the city had grown dramatically since then, and the space had become inadequate. Bollini's announced project had been immediately preceded by the Panic of 1890, however, and the effect of this crisis on the city's leading source of tax revenue British investment, led to plans of a relatively modest scale. Among the cost- saving measures was the city's enlistment of the Assistant Minister of Public Works, Juan Cagnoni, as chief architect, as well as the decision to build on the site of the outmoded police headquarters. Decorative tilework and chandeliers from the adjacent Zuberb√ºhler house, which had recently been expropriated to make way for the Avenida de Mayo, were likewise salvaged for use in the upcoming city hall (where they remain to the present day). The cornerstone laying ceremony was held on New Year's Eve 1890, for which the Mayor contributed a time capsule which included the construction permit among other mementoes. The works themselves cost the city a modest 150,000 pesos (US$75,000), and were completed in 1892. Inaugurated in March 1893, the new city hall originally housed 860 m¬≤ (9,200 ft¬≤), and was only a little more spacious than the earlier offices. This problem was ultimately resolved by the 1911 acquisition of an adjacent residential lot, which allowed the expansion of the city hall to nearly double. Designed in the same Second Empire style with which Cagnoni designed the first part, the engineering firm of Bonneu Ibero, Parodi & Figini completed the annex in 1914. A connection to the adjacent House of Culture was opened following the latter's acquisition by the city in 1988.Palacio Municipal de Buenos Aires Government View of the Building The 1880 Federalization of Buenos Aires, enacted in a bid to end the internecine warfare between those who favored a united Argentina with a strong central government (Unitarios) and Buenos Aires Province leaders who favored an independent nation of their own (Federales), resulted in President Julio Roca's passage in 1882 of National Law 1260, which created the presidential prerogative of the appointment of the Mayor of Buenos Aires (though with a locally elected city council). This remained the city's governing structure in 1993, when former President Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n prevailed on his successor, President Carlos Menem, to agree to a limited devolution of governing powers to the city (the Olivos Pact). Accordingly, the 1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution included article 129, which guaranteed Buenos Aires greater self- governance. The Indentente (appointed Mayor) was replaced by a Jefe de Gobierno (elected Mayor), and the city council by the Buenos Aires City Legislature. Shortly before the historic, June 30, 1996, elections to these posts, however, a senior Peronist Senator, Antonio Cafiero, succeeded in limiting the city's autonomy by advancing National Law 24.588, which reserved control of the 25,000-strong Polic√≠a Federal (the federally administered city police), the Port of Buenos Aires and other faculties to the national government.Infobae: Qu√© dice la Ley Cafiero The controversial bill, signed in 1996 by President Menem, remained a sticking point between successive Presidents (most of whom have been Peronist) and Buenos Aires Mayors (none of whom have been). A 2005 agreement on principles between Mayor An√≠bal Ibarra and President N√©stor Kirchner was followed by the modification of the especially contentious article 7, which denied the city its own, local police force, in 2007 - though the \\"Cafiero Law\\" otherwise remains in force. Efforts since 2007 by Mayor Mauricio Macri to declare it unconstitutional have thus far failed, and though the Mayor inaugurated a Metropolitan Police, issues of revenue sharing for its financing remain pending.Parlamentario: Piden que declaren inconstitucional la ley Cafiero References Category:City and town halls in Argentina Category:Buildings and structures in Buenos Aires Category:Government buildings completed in 1892 ","title":"Buenos Aires City Hall"},{"id":"24107411","text":"Masaharu Anesaki , also known under his pen name , was a leading Japanese intellectual and scholar of the Meiji period. Anesaki is credited as being the father of religious studies in Japan, but also wrote on a variety of subjects including culture, literature, and politics. He was also a member of the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations. After studies in Philosophy at the Tokyo Imperial University, he spent three years in Europe (1900‚Äì1903). During this time he studied under Deussen, Hermann Oldenberg, Gerbe, and Albrecht Weber in Germany, as well as Thomas William Rhys Davids in England. He spent more than another year abroad in 1908‚Äì09 with partial support from Albert Kahn, the French Philanthropist. During that time he traveled extensively through Italy, tracing the steps of Saint Francis of Assisi. His travelogue Hanatsumi Nikki (Flowers of Italy) recounts that journey. He spent 1913 to 1915 as a visiting scholar at Harvard University lecturing on Japanese literature and life. The lecture notes from this period were revised and were later the base for the book History of Japanese Religion. He was also instrumental in founding the scholarly collection that became the library of the University of Tokyo. A devout Nichiren Buddhist, he also published such titles as \\"How Christianity appeals to a Japanese Buddhist\\" (Hibbert Journal, 1905). He translated Schopenhauer's Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung into Japanese and explored terms of understanding between Buddhism and Western Philosophy.

Career Neuffer began her career with The Boston Globe in the Washington bureau, where she covered Capitol Hill and the Clinton Administration‚Äôs plan for health care reform. She also reported from Moscow on the breakup of the Soviet Union, and from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Iraq during the Gulf War. She served as the European Bureau Chief from 1994 to 1998 in Berlin.

Trigonoceratoidea are characterized by open-spiraled, gyroconic, to closed, nautiliconic shells in which the Whorl section is quadrate in primitive forms; the venter typically narrow to acute, the dorsum broad. In some advanced forms, the venter may become concave or broad and rounded, and in some, the surfaces may be strongly lirate. Classification and phylogeny The Trigonoceratoidea are based on the family Trigonoceratidae of Alpheus Hyatt, 1884, with which other phylogenetically related families are combined, and are equivalent to the abandoned Centroceratida of Flower in Flower and K√ºmmel 1950, and to the Centroceratina of Shimanskiy 1957, revised to the Centrocerataceae, Shimanskiy 1962. The Trigonoceratoidea combine five families, the type, Trigonoceratidae, along with the Centroceratidae, Grypoceratidae, Permoceratidae, and Syringonautilidae. Phylogenetic study and age show that the Centroceratidae are the root stock in spite of having been first recognized 16 years after the Trigonoceratidae were first described. The Centroceratidae gave rise to the Trigonoceratidae and Grypoceratidae in the early Mississippian, while continuing until the very Early Permian. The Trigonoceratidae which ranged into the Permian left to descendants. The Grypoceratidae which ranged almost to the end of the Triassic gave rise to two small families, the Permian Permoceratidae and the Triassic Syringonautilidae. The Syringonautilidae, in turn, are the source for the Nautilidae (Nautilaceae) which contain the genus Nautilus. Families The Trigonoceratidae, type family, named by Hyatt, 1884, are loosely coiled to evolute, with oval to subquadrate, compressed to depressed whorl sections, and generally with longitudinal ridges or lirae. Sutures are typically slightly sinuous; the siphuncle small, subcentral, and orthochoanitic. In all the umbilicus is open and perforate. It includes some 17 genera. The Centroceratidae, ancestral stock, proposed by Hyatt in 1900, consist of gyroconic to evolute and involute shells that have a quadrangular cross section in which the venter is much narrower that the dorsum, the venereal and umbilical shoulders usually angular, the flanks flattened and converging on the venter. Sutures form lobes on the sides and venter but are transverse across the dorsum. The siphuncle is tubular, orthochoanitic, and close to but not on the ventral margin. It includes some six genera. The Grypoceratidae, predominant stock, established by Hyatt in 1900, are characterized by generally smooth, compressed, evolute to involute shells with the venter flattened to subangular. Ornamenation is not common, but some forms bear nodes or keels. Sutures have distinct ventral and lateral lobes. The siphuncle, which is narrow and tubular, is variable in position. It includes about 13 genera.

Once the threshold is reached, the system rapidly changes its state.  In electric power  Tipping points are commonly used in electric switches to assure fast opening and closing of switch contacts, so as to minimize electric arc formation and prevent burning or welding of the switch contacts.  Toggle switches  The switch mechanism is designed to have two stable states that are a mirror image of each other, with the contact actuator always resting at one stable state or the other. Movement of the switch control lever applies tension to a spring, until the control lever crosses the tipping or equilibrium point of the contact actuator. The spring then pushes the actuator to the opposite state, releasing the spring tension. There are several advantages to the tipping point mechanism in comparison to old-fashioned direct-operated knife switches: * The speed at which the control lever is operated does not affect the speed at which the spring releases its tension. Moving the control quickly or slowly simply compresses the spring, and the actuator does not move until the tipping point is crossed. * The tipping point design prevents damage to the contacts due to the switch being opened slowly, resulting in arc formation, or the switch contacts not being closed completely and firmly. * The tipping point also provides some protection against physical impacts that could cause the actuator to open, because the tipping point spring applies steady pressure across the contacts. However large springs and levers can produce a loud clunking noise as they suddenly release. In homes this noise is undesirable, resulting in the development of much simpler tipping point mechanisms of low mass, using leaf springs and a very small strip of metal as the contact actuator.  Microswitches  Tipping points with a very small separation distance between equilibrium states are used in microswitches. Large switches use separate springs, levers, and hinges to construct the tipping point, but the microswitch uses a very small kinked metal leaf spring. The strip is secured at one end very close to the kink, which bends the strip in an upward direction. Pressure is applied very close to the kink, which causes the strip to invert the kink and pop downward, swinging the end of the strip down and moving the switch contacts. Releasing the pressure on the spring causes it to pop back to its original shape, swinging the end of the strip upward and reverting the switch to its original state. Because hinge points are eliminated and the motion is due to stressing of a thin metal strip, microswitches are extremely reliable, operating for millions of cycles without failure. A larger switch constructed of separate springs and levers wears out more quickly, due to the hinge points rubbing together under the high pressure of the tipping point spring.  Set-point thermostats  Electrical equipment that utilizes heating and cooling systems often incorporate small pop-disc thermostats which open or close at a set temperature that cannot be changed by the end-user. The disc is formed from a bi-metallic sheet, with two layers of metal that expand at different rates, and is stamped into the final bowl shape. The switch contacts are in the center and around the circumference of the bowl. At the transition temperature, the metallic expansion stresses on the bowl cause it to suddenly \\"pop\\" and invert itself. Depending on switch contact arrangement above and below the bowl, inversion may either open or close the electric circuit. The inverted bowl is held under tension in the inverted shape, and it takes a certain amount of temperature drop for the bi- metallic stresses to build up sufficiently in the opposite direction, causing the bowl to \\"unpop\\" back to its original shape.

As of 2018 the channel is transmitted on all the major broadcast platforms in the UK - terrestrial, satellite and cable. The channel is only broadcast in standard-definition. As a free-to-air channel, supported by advertising, it is subject to standard UK broadcasting rules, which means that films shown between 5.30 am and 9 pm are often edited to make them suitable for pre-watershed slots. After 9 pm, the rules are more relaxed and films will generally not be censored. The channel formerly aired an Animax programming block every Monday night. History Launch and transmission on satellite The Sony Movie Channel brand was made available outside the US for the first time when a British version of the station launched on the Sky platform in the UK and Ireland on . To release Sky guide slots for the launch of SMC and its +1 timeshift, Movies4Men 2 and its +1 service were closed (and thus lost by Freesat viewers). At launch and until 2018, SMC was broadcast on a free-to-view basis, meaning that access to channel was only available to those with a Sky viewing card, and although no subscription payment was required to view the channel, it was unavailable to Freesat devices. Sony Movie Channel became fully free to air on satellite on 13 August 2018, in preparation for its full launch on the Freesat programme guide on 9 October 2018.Sony Movie Channel joins Freesat a516digital October 8, 2018. Retrieved October 16, 2018 To permit SMC's launch on Freesat, Sony reorganised their other movie channels on the guide: Movies4Men +1 was no longer listed on the Freesat guide as a result of the addition of SMC, though remains freely available for manual tune-in. Encryption was also removed from Sony Movie Channel +1 at the same time, though this was not added to the Freesat full guide. On 24 July 2019, it was announced that the channel will be renamed as Sony Movies from 10 September 2019. Freeview and cable (Movie Mix) When launched on 15 July 2009, The Big Deal broadcast live interactive quiz content 7 days a week from 22:00-05:00 on Freeview channel 37 (later channel 32), initially timesharing with RT and Create and Craft. Each night, The Big Deal broadcast various games and puzzles, with cash prizes to be won for viewers who guessed the correct answers. Viewers were asked to call in or log on to The Big Deal website to enter these games. Later in the year The Big Deal reduced its timeslot from 22:00-05:00 to 00:30-05:00. On 6 November 2009, The Big Deal ceased broadcasting its live quiz content. Teleshopping instead commenced broadcasting between 04:00-06:00, later reduced to 05:00-06:00, in areas yet to undergo digital switchover. A 24-hour version of the channel, meanwhile, was rolled out using the same channel number in post-DSO areas; the fulltime version was made available in all areas on 2 March 2011. On 12 April 2011, The Big Deal began broadcasting TView, a short-lived pay-per-view film service, with broadcasting hours reduced to 18:00-05:00. The TView service ran until 27 April 2011, when it was replaced by teleshopping, and its hours were reduced further to 18:00-22:00. From 7 July 2011, The Big Deal changed back to operating 05:00-06:00, then, on 6 September 2011 it changed its broadcasting 00:00-04:00. The broadcasting hours were changed again on 20 October 2011 to 03:00-05:00. By this point, in addition to teleshopping presentations the channel also broadcast psychic sessions in which the viewer could ask for their own psychic reading. On 6 December 2012, The Big Deal was renamed Movie Mix on the programme guide, and reacquired a 24-hour broadcast slot. The channel continued airing chiefly teleshopping - initially via a simulcast of Speed Auction TV - as well as a classic movie each night. On 17 January 2013, Movie Mix on Freeview began to simulcast the full schedule of films and programmes of satellite channel More Than Movies (previously known as men&movies;), though presented under the retained Movie Mix branding. The Movie Mix channel initially remained owned and operated by Cellcast subsidiary Square 1 Management, but using More Than Movies programming under license from Sony Pictures Television. In March 2014, Cellcast agreed to early termination of its exclusive rights for Movie Mix for a one off payment of ¬£2.98m from Entertainment Networks, a subsidiary of Sony Pictures Television,. bringing Movie Mix and More Than Movies under common ownership. The channels continued to carry the same programming and split branding as before. On 22 March 2016, More Than Movies on satellite was closed down and was replaced by True Crime, with Movie Mix retained on Freeview only, broadcasting its own programming schedule, By this time many films on Movie Mix on Freeview were also being broadcast on the Sony Movie Channel on satellite, though the channels retained separate schedules and branding. On 12 August 2016 Movie Mix began testing on Virgin Media cable systems, with the channel fully launched on 25 August 2016. This meant the Movie Mix schedule was now available on terrestrial and cable platforms, but not on satellite. In December 2016 it was announced that Sony Movie Channel would be re-launched and made available over cable and Freeview in January 2017, by way of a rebranding of Movie Mix. On 10 January 2017, the channel replaced Movie Mix on the Freeview and Virgin Media platforms. In preparation for the switch Movie Mix and SMC had been broadcasting an identical schedule in the final days prior to the transition. Although now fully free-to-air on Freeview, the channel remained unavailable to Freesat users until satellite encryption was lifted in August 2018.

The principle is sometimes stated as a recommendation to the programmer, but sometimes stated as a requirement of the programming language, assuming it is self-understood why abstractions are desirable to use. The origins of the principle are uncertain; it has been reinvented a number of times, sometimes under a different name, with slight variations. When read as recommendation to the programmer, the abstraction principle can be generalized as the \\"don't repeat yourself\\" principle, which recommends avoiding the duplication of information in general, and also avoiding the duplication of human effort involved in the software development process.  The principle  As a recommendation to the programmer, in its formulation by Benjamin C. Pierce in Types and Programming Languages (2002), the abstraction principle reads (emphasis in original): As a requirement of the programming language, in its formulation by David A. Schmidt in The structure of typed programming languages (1994), the abstraction principle reads:.David A. Schmidt, The structure of typed programming languages, MIT Press, 1994, , p. 32  History and variations  Under this very name, the abstraction principle appears into a long list of books. Here we give a necessarily incomplete list, together with the formulation if it is succinct: * Alfred John Cole, Ronald Morrison (1982) An introduction to programming with S-algol: \\"[Abstraction] when applied to language design is to define all the semantically meaningful syntactic categories in the language and allow an abstraction over them\\".Alfred John Cole, Ronald Morrison, An introduction to programming with S-algol, CUP Archive, 1982, , p. 150 * Bruce J. MacLennan (1983) Principles of programming languages: design, evaluation, and implementation: \\"Avoid requiring something to be stated more than once; factor out the recurring pattern\\".Bruce J. MacLennan, Principles of programming languages: design, evaluation, and implementation, Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1983, p. 53 * Jon Pearce (1998) Programming and Meta-Programming in Scheme: \\"Structure and function should be independent\\".Jon Pearce, Programming and meta-programming in scheme, Birkh√§user, 1998, , p. 40 The principle plays a central role in design patterns in object-oriented programming, although most writings on that topic do not give a name to the principle. The influential book by the Gang of Four, states: \\"The focus here is encapsulating the concept that varies, a theme of many design patterns.\\" This statement has been rephrased by other authors as \\"Find what varies and encapsulate it.\\"Alan Shalloway, James Trott, Design patterns explained: a new perspective on object-oriented design, Addison-Wesley, 2002, , p. 115 In this century, the principle has been reinvented in extreme programming under the slogan \\"Once and Only Once\\". The definition of this principle was rather succinct in its first appearance: \\"no duplicate code\\".Kent Beck, Extreme programming explained: embrace change, 2nd edition, Addison-Wesley, 2000, , p. 61 It has later been elaborated as applicable to other issues in software development: \\"Automate every process that's worth automating. If you find yourself performing a task many times, script it.\\"Chromatic, Extreme programming pocket guide, O'Reilly, 2003,  Implications  The abstraction principle is often stated in the context of some mechanism intended to facilitate abstraction. The basic mechanism of control abstraction is a function or subroutine. Data abstractions include various forms of type polymorphism. More elaborate mechanisms that may combine data and control abstractions include: abstract data types, including classes, polytypism etc. The quest for richer abstractions that allow less duplication in complex scenarios is one of the driving forces in programming language research and design. Inexperienced programmers may be tempted to introduce too much abstraction in their program --abstraction that won't be used more than once. A complementary principle that emphasize this issue is \\"You Ain't Gonna Need It\\" and, more generally, the KISS principle. Since code is usually subject to revisions, following the abstraction principle may entail refactoring of code. The effort of rewriting a piece of code generically needs to be amortized against the estimated future benefits of an abstraction. A rule of thumb governing this was devised by Martin Fowler, and popularized as the rule of three. It states that if a piece of code is copied more than twice, i.e. it would end up having three or more copies, then it needs to be abstracted out.  Generalizations  \\"Don't repeat yourself\\", or the \\"DRY principle\\", is a generalization developed in the context of multi-tier architectures, where related code is by necessity duplicated to some extent across tiers, usually in different languages. In practical terms, the recommendation here is to rely on automated tools, like code generators and data transformations to avoid repetition.  Hardware programming interfaces  In addition to optimizing code, a hierarchical/recursive meaning of Abstraction level in programming also refers to the interfaces between hardware communication layers, also called \\"abstraction levels\\" and \\"abstraction layers.\\" In this case, level of abstraction often is synonymous with interface. For example, in examining shellcode and the interface between higher and lower level languages, the level of abstraction changes from operating system commands (for example, in C) to register and circuit level calls and commands (for example, in assembly and binary). In the case of that example, the boundary or interface between the abstraction levels is the stack.Koziol, The Shellcoders Handbook\\", Wiley, 2004, p. 10, References Category:Programming language topics Category:Programming principles ","title":"Abstraction principle (computer programming)"},{"id":"24107657","text":"Domeyko, Domejko, or Domeiko may refer to: *Ignacy Domeyko *Cordillera Domeyko, a mountain range *2784 Domeyko, an asteroid See also * Domeykos ","title":"Domeyko"},{"id":"24107660","text":"The Art and Culture Center/Hollywood is an arts venue in Hollywood, Florida at 1650 Harrison Street in Broward County. The Center presents contemporary visual and performing arts shows and includes an adjacent art school and the Hollywood Central Performing Arts Center at 1770 Monroe Street (US 1 and Monroe Street).  History  The City of Hollywood opened the Art and Culture Center/Hollywood in 1975 at 1301 S. Ocean Drive in Hollywood. In 1978, the Art and Culture Center/Hollywood was incorporated as a non-profit, 501(c)(3) non- profit corporation. From its former beachfront gallery, which was dedicated in a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Nov. 2, 1975, the Center found its niche in South Florida's art scene promoting innovative contemporary artists and hosting educational programs. In 1991, the Center moved to the city-owned, historic (circa 1924) Kagey mansion in downtown Hollywood at 1650 Harrison Street. The move allowed immediate expansion in display space, and also added classrooms for youth and adult arts education. After renovations, the Center's new home opened to the public in 1992. Also in the early 1990s, the Center opened its Arts School in an adjacent building at 1626 Harrison Street. The Center redefined its mission in 1997 to offer performing arts on par with its visual arts programs. In 2000, it took over the programming and management of the city's Hollywood Central Performing Arts Center, a 500-seat theater located at 1770 Monroe Street. (U.S. 1 and Monroe Street). Designated a Major Cultural Institution in Broward County on Oct. 6, 2005 by the Broward County Board of County Commissioners as recommended by the Broward Cultural Council, the Center today is only one of eight Major Cultural Institutions in the county out of 575 cultural entities. Programs Annually, the Art and Culture Center provides programming which impacts more than 50,000 South Florida residents and visitors. Its adult and children's visual and performing arts education programs celebrate creativity and excellence, while its innovative exhibitions, films and performances introduce fresh perspective to the arts. Educational programming includes adult, children's and youth arts classes, after-school and outreach programs, camps, and other art curricula that meet Next Generation Sunshine State Standards. In partnership with the Broward Education Communications Network, the Center offers distance learning arts classes to Broward County Public Schools (elementary, middle, high and ESE schools). The Center also provides music/drama/theater and visual arts programming for schools and other non-profits. Committed to creating opportunities for all people to experience the visual and performing arts, through its support by individuals and public and private entities, the Center offers complimentary admission to its galleries on the third Sunday of most months (check schedule), tuition waivers for qualifying youth to its variety of education programs as well as free family-friendly interactive performances featuring music, theater, and dance.  History of Art and Culture Center Building  Kagey mansion, 1924 This beautiful example of Mediterranean Revival architecture was built in the summer of 1924 by the home's founding family, Mr. and Mrs. Jack Kagey. Built for an estimated cost of $16,000, it is one of Hollywood's first show place homes and was completed a year before the City of Hollywood was incorporated. Jack Kagey was the sales manager of Joseph W. Young's Hollywood Land and Water Company. He earned the seed money to build the home by winning a contest held by Young for his salesmen during the height of the 1920s real estate boom. Kagey and his 11-man team sold $426,260 in properties in just 10 weeks. First prize was a choice of a car or $5,000. Kagey took the money since he already owned two cars. The Kageys were in the home for just two years, when in September 1926, the structure withstood a devastating hurricane that ended the land boom and reduced the City's population from 18,000 people to just 2,000. The home shares many features of Joseph Young's house on Hollywood Boulevard. This includes the Batchelder tiles in the fountain in the main gallery, which were inspired by tiles from southern Spain. The home offers a central tower, hip roof with Spanish clay tiles, second-floor balcony with Norman double arches, a balconette, and rough stucco wall finish. The space that now houses the main exhibition gallery was once the garden (hence the fountain). The current Executive Director's office was the master bedroom and the library was the living room (the original fireplace remains). The home was owned in the 1930s by an industrialist who manufactured Brillo pads, and in the '40s was rumored to have been a gambling parlor, according to Bill Foster, whose twin brother Edward lived here with his wife and three children in the 1950s. This remained a private residence until 1960 when the Foster family converted it into a funeral home. The Fosters doubled the size of the home, which became the Johnson-Foster Funeral Home, to 12,000-square feet. The additions included a chapel along the east side that later became the Center's main gallery. Many of the home's original features from the 1920s were retained, such as the glass doorknobs, wrought- iron railings, tiles on the second-floor balcony, wood moldings and floors, and arches. In January 1990, the property was purchased by the City of Hollywood to become the new home of the Art and Culture Center/Hollywood, which had operated on Hollywood Beach since 1978. The home was renovated with private and historical state grant monies and opened on February 2, 1992, with the exhibition As Seen By Both Sides, a collection of 83 works by 20 American and 20 Vietnamese artists. The Art and Culture Center/Hollywood now serves as a cultural landmark for both its contemporary visual arts programming and for the distinctive character of the structure. In 2008, the Broward Trust for Historic Preservation honored the Art and Culture Center/Hollywood for its stewardship of the Kagey building. The building is currently designated by the State of Florida as a significant historical structure and is forever to be held for public enjoyment by city government.

Aralam Wildlife Sanctuary is the northernmost wildlife sanctuary of Kerala, southwest India. It is in area and located on the western slope of the Western Ghats. It was established in 1984. The headquarters of the sanctuary is near Iritty. Aralam Wildlife Sanctuary is situated in the southeast part of Kannur District. It lies between 11¬∞ 54‚Ä≤ and 11¬∞ 59‚Ä≤ north latitude and 75¬∞ 47‚Ä≤ and 75¬∞ 57‚Ä≤ east longitude. The sanctuary area falls in Aralam, Kelakam and Kottiyoor revenue villages and is located in the northwest slopes of Western Ghats contiguous with the forests of Coorg (Kodagu) district of Karnataka state. The PA (protected area) consists of Aralam Range, the only range of Aralam wildlife division, which is part of Northern Wildlife Circle (Northern Region) Palakkad. The extent of the sanctuary is . The sanctuary was constituted in 1984 as per GO (P) 300/84/AD dated 15 October 1984. It was formed by carving out areas from the Odanthode Malavaram of Thalassery special division which was an erstwhile private forest, subsequently taken over by Govt. as per the provisions of the Kerala Private Forests (vesting and assignment) Act 1971 and from the Kottiyoor RF of Wayanad Forest Division. The vested forest portion of the sanctuary is and the 22.36 km2 is part of Kottiyoor RF (Reserved Forest). Till 30.6.98 this sanctuary was a range in Wayanad Wildlife Division. It started functioning as an independent wildlife division since 1.7.98 as per GO (MS) 36/98 dated 27.5.98. In the First Management Plan the entire area was divided into two zones viz: the Core Zone and the Buffer Zone. Climatic factors include rainfall, temperature, humidity, frost and so on. * Average rainfall: 4000 mm * Temperature: 11.0¬∞C to 40.0¬∞C * Humidity: 60 to 100 % * Wind: Regular wind during Southwest monsoon * Water source: Cheenkannipuzha Conditions Rainfall Rainfall data available in the Central State Farm, Aralam, which is just adjoining to the sanctuary area has been analysed. The major source of moisture in the tract is in the form of rainfall. The total annual rainfall seldom falls below 4000 mm. The maximum annual value for the nine years data available is 5052.60 mm and the minimum is 3745.50 mm. In specialised localities, in the higher reaches (where there are no rain gauges), the rainfall goes as high as over 6000 mm. Most (more than 70%) of the rainfall is obtained during the southwest monsoon in June, July and August months. The retreating monsoon though less pronounced, is an important source of moisture in October, November and December, which constitutes 14% of the total. Summer rains vary widely and is not dependable. In the Peninsular India the vegetation type and growing period are determined by the extent of dry period rather than by the amount of rainfall. The spread of rainy days across time (around the year) is a crucial determining factor in the plant growth. The dry period in the area varies between three and four months when the monthly rainfall is below 50 mm, and the number of rainy days varies from 100 to 120. Variation is observed in the quantity of rainfall as the altitude changes to higher levels. Temperature The temperature at the foothills varies from 11.0¬∞C to 40.0¬∞C. The diurnal variations are moderate. As the altitude increases the variation is comparatively small, between 8.0¬∞C and 25.0¬∞C. The hottest months are April and May. December to February is relatively cool. Humidity At the foothills the humidity varies from 60% to 100%. Winds Regular winds lash the area during the southwest monsoon period. Strong winds of dry nature blow from September to April, causing dryness in the locality with the result there is a fire hazard, especially in the deciduous forests. Microclimate Locations where very high rainfall and peculiar soil conditions in the folds of the hills bring in specialised microclimatic situations leading to a peculiar habitat, which supports relatively specialised vegetation. Such portions are found here and there on the higher reaches.

History Splintered was formed when Fourth Dimension Records and Grim Humour fanzine's Richard (Richo) Johnson's previous band, Playground, fell apart in 1989. With other ex-Playground members Paul Wright (bass), Paul Dudeney (drums, metal percussion) and James Machin (guitar) & Steven Wright (FX\`S). Splintered sought to push the previous band's noise excursions to denser realms. They picked up interest from several underground record labels and garnered some attention as part of a subculture of industrial and experimental groups in the UK, including Terminal Cheesecake, Skullflower, Ramleh, Loop and Godflesh. The band uses an array of instruments, samples, multi-layered guitars, electronics, powerful rhythms and often submerged, shouted vocals. Other members who joined the group included Steve Pittis (Band of Pain, Dirter Promotions) and Colin Bradley (Dual). The first album featured Stefx (Headbutt) on drums when Paul Dudeney failed to make the recording sessions. In 1997, James and the two Pauls decided they needed a break and could not face a European tour arranged for the same year. Richo, aided by Colin Bradley (tabletop guitar/electronics), assembled a final line-up for this that consisted of Stuart Carter (Heroin, Sarcasm, The Fields of Hay) on bass, Hassni Malik (dROME, The Vitamin B12) on guitar and James Hodson (later of Faust) on drums, percussion and flute. Once over, and following the release of another album in 1998, the group once again ground to a halt and during the course of the next two years got replaced by a new group, Theme, which consisted of Richo, Stuart and Hassni. Theme continue to this day and have had numerous albums out and have themselves collaborated with Jean-herve Peron of Faust. Splintered reactivated in 2013 with the release of a 2CD collection of rarities, singles and previously unreleased material on Finland's Totuuden Sarvi Levyt label. Since then, the original lineup of the group (augmented by Stuart Carter) have played live a few times in London and Poland. More live work is planned to promote the reissue of 1996's 'Moraine' album on Fourth Dimension Records in late 2017. This reissue also features new recordings based on the original two lengthy songs constituting the first LP. Side projects Splintered were involved in several other projects along the way as well. These were usually activated by Richo and Steve Pittis, plus often involved other members of the group as well as others. These projects were Husk, A.S.P., Slugbait and Band Of Pain. All of them had releases out, on both Steve Pittis and Richo's respective labels and others such as Ralf Wehowsky's Selektion, Meeuw Muzak and Cold Spring Records. Band Of Pain then became the main concern for Steve Pittis and continues to record to this day, with a new album released in 2017.

He was also noted for his performance in literary face-offs known as Kavigan. Biography Born Hensman Anthony, the sobriquet Firingee (The foreigner of European origin) was used colloquially as a reference to his Portuguese origins. Although not much is known of his early life, Anthony arrived in Bengal sometime in early 19th century and subsequently came to settle in Farashdanga, in the town of Chandannagar in West Bengal. He married a Hindu Brahmin widow named Saudamini and was deeply influenced by Bengali culture and language, as well as the Hindu religion. Eventually, Anthony came to learn the language and composed a number of noted religious songs in devotion to the Goddesses Kali and Durga. He is noted for his Agamani Songs, celebrating the return of Goddess Durga to her parents home that marks the Bengali Autumn festival of Durga Puja. Anthony is also noted for his literary face-offs in Kavigans, or Bard's duels, with a number of noted Bengali composers including Bhola Moira, Ram Basu and Thakur Singha. Anthony also helped construct a temple to Goddess Kali in the Bowbazar locality of Central Calcutta known as 'Firinghi Kalibari'. His wife Saudamini was burnt to death, for being a widow and remarrying Anthony, who was a foreigner. In popular culture ; Books The first reference to Anthony Firingee is a novel by Madan Bandopadhay titled Kabiyal Anthony Firingee. ; Films * A 1967 Bengali film by director Sunil Bannerjee portrayed the life and works of Anthony, and had Bengali actor Uttam Kumar in the title role. The film was noted for its music, composed by Anil Bagchi & lyrics by Gouri Prasanna Majumdar among others and earned Uttam Kumar an Indian National Film Award for Best Actor in 1968. * A 2014 adaptation by director Srijit Mukherji titled Jaatishwar featured the life of Anthony from a retrospective view but with a modern-day context. Jaatishwar also received an Indian National Film Awards in 2014, in four categories, including Best singer and Best Music Director. References * Miah S and Islam S.

Established in 1610, St. John's is the oldest English-speaking parish in continuous existence in the United States of America. History English settlers from Jamestown established a community and church on the tip of the Virginia Peninsula on July 9, 1610, one month after Lord De La Warr arrived at Jamestown with supplies that effectively ended the Starving Time in that settlement. This new settlement was named after the Algonquian-speaking Kecoughtan who lived in the area. First parish site, 1610‚Äì1623 Excavations in the Church Creek area of Hampton indicate that the earliest English settlements were near present-day LaSalle and Chesapeake Avenues. The first minister of the new parish was the Reverend William Mease who was appointed by the Bishop of London to lead the church at Kecoughtan. A historical marker on LaSalle Ave marks the approximate location of the first site. Second parish site, 1623‚Äì1667 In 1619 the settlement was renamed Elizabeth Cittie [sic]. By 1623 the town had re-established itself east of Hampton River, where the second church of Elizabeth City parish was built. The site is included within the grounds of what is now Hampton University. Abandoned in 1667 after a third church was built, the foundations of the second church were discovered in 1910. It was a small wooded structure to which a vestibule was added later. Today, the original foundations and some of the brick floor have been excavated and can be seen at the second site, along with information, conjectural paintings, and a historical marker. Artifacts found during the excavation are on display in the St. John's Parish House museum. Third parish site, 1667‚Äì1728 The third building of the parish was constructed more than a mile to the west of the second church at \\"Westwoods Town Quarter\\", indicating that there was growth of the town on the west side of Hampton River. Like the previous structure, it was made of wood and was of similar size. This building continued in use for about 60 years. The site is located off West Pembroke Avenue east of LaSalle Avenue and features a historical marker, building foundations outlined by bricks, several 17th and 18th-century gravestones, and a protective brick wall. Fourth parish site, 1728‚Äìpresent In the early 18th century, activity centered about the busy port which has become downtown Hampton. The parishioners petitioned the Governor for permission to relocate their place of worship closer to the population center. It was granted, and construction of the fourth church on one and one half acres on the outskirts of Hampton began. Henry Cary Jr. of Williamsburg completed the present cruciform building in 1728. A belfry was added to the west front in 1762. The building was damaged in the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, and (most extensively) the Civil War. It took the parish several decades to complete repair the church after the War of 1812. After full restoration, on Saturday, 6 March 1830, Bishop Richard Channing Moore, Bishop of Virginia, consecrated the church with its new name St. John's. The building was damaged again during the Civil War on 7 August 1861. In an attempt to keep the town from Union occupation, Confederate soldiers set fire to homes, businesses and the church. The great bell was destroyed, and only the blackened walls remained by the time Union soldiers occupied the town and camped in the churchyard. As a result of the fire, St. John's is the only surviving colonial structure in downtown Hampton. At war's end, contributions due to a widespread appeal to rebuild the church were used. Restoration was finished around 1869/1870. Although the exterior's colonial appearance was restored (except for the belfry), the interior reflects the late 19th-century Victorian influence. Early in the 20th century, the rear tower was added, the west gallery was built in 1957, the chapel completed in 1985, and the current manual tracker organ installed in 1993. Points of interest The 1618 Communion silver used today have the longest history of continuous use in America of any English church silver. The pieces were brought from England in 1619 and used in a church founded in 1618 located in Smith's Hundred in Virginia, which lay in the point between the Chickahominy and the James Rivers, eight miles northwest of Jamestown. The church was nearly destroyed in the Indian Massacre of 22 March 1622(NS). The silver was carried by Governor George Yeardley to Jamestown and afterward, approximately 1628, given to the second Elizabeth City Church, which had just been built. St. John's continues to use communion silver on special occasions. The chalice has inscribed the London date-letter for 1618-1619 and the text \\"THE COMMVNION CVPP FOR SNT MARYS CHVRCH IN SMITHS HVNDRED IN VIRGINIA\\". There are two patens with the same London date-letter. The first paten has the inscription \\"Whosoever shall eate this bread and drinke the cupp of the Lord/unworthily shalbe gilty of the body & blood of ye Lord Cor Ixith\\". The second paten has written: \\"If any man eate of this Bread he shall live for ever Jo VIth\\". In 1887 the Native American students from the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute (now Hampton University) contributed to a stained glass window depicting the baptism of Pocahontas. On the chapel wall to the left of the main altar is an aumbry. The door panel consists of pieces of the 13th- century stained glass from St. Helena Church, Willoughby Parish, Lincolnshire County, United Kingdom - the parish in which Captain John Smith was baptized. The panel was presented to the St. John's Parish by the rector of Willoughby St. Helena on Sunday, 14 July 1985, as part of St. John's 375th anniversary celebration.

It has been a crucial tool in studying the development of the Drosophila nervous system. This technique relies on recombination during mitosis mediated by FLP-FRT recombination. As one copy of a gene, provided by the balancer chromosome, is often enough to rescue a mutant phenotype, MARCM clones can be used to study a mutant phenotype in an otherwise wildtype animal.  Crosses  A visual depiction of MARCM In order to label small populations of cells from a common progenitor, MARCM uses the GAL4-UAS system. A marker gene such as GFP is placed under control of a UAS promoter. GAL4 is ubiquitously expressed in these flies, thus driving marker expression. In addition, GAL80 is driven by a strong promoter such as tubP. Gal80 is an inhibitor of GAL4, and will suppress GFP expression under normal conditions. This tubP-GAL80 element is placed distal to an FRT site. A second FRT site is placed in trans to the GAL80 site, usually with a gene or mutation of interest distal to it. Finally, FLP recombinase is driven by an inducible promoter such as heat shock. When FLP transcription is induced, it will recombine the chromosomes at the two FRT sites in cells undergoing mitosis. These cells will divide into two homozygous daughter cells‚Äîone carrying both GAL80 elements, and one carrying none. The daughter cell lacking GAL80 will be labeled due to expression of the marker via the GAL4-UAS system. All subsequent daughter cells from this progenitor will also express the marker. Labs will often have MARCM-ready lines which have the inducible FLP, GAL80 distal to a FRT site, GAL4, and UAS-Marker. These can be readily crossed with flies that have a mutation of interest distal to a FRT site.A Drosophila crossing scheme to produce progeny for MARCM studies  Uses  By taking advantage of MARCM, one can easily trace all the cells that have been generated from a single progenitor. This is useful tool in tracking development and specific cell lineages in various environmental conditions. Applications for MARCM include studying neuronal circuits, clonal analysis, genetic screens, spermatogenesis, growth cone development, neurogenesis, and tumor metastasis. Many advances in the understanding of Drosophila development have been achieved through MARCM. The development, lineages, and characterizations of secondary axon tracts, anatomical maps of cholinergic neurons in the visual systems, lineages giving rise to a thoracic hemineuromere scaffold and the developmental framework for CNS architecture, the role of Delta in developmental programming in the ventral nerve cord, the wake-promoting octopaminergic cells in the medial protocerebrum, genes involved in neuronal morphogenesis of the mushroom bodies, and the regulation of commissural axon guidance have all been identified through MARCM techniques.  Variations  There are many variations of MARCM. Twin-spot MARCM allows for labeling of sister clones with two separate markers, thus allowing for a higher resolution of lineage tracing. In reverse MARCM, the mutation of interest is placed on the same chromosome as GAL80, so that the wild-type homozygous clones will be labeled. Flip-Out MARCM highlights individual cells inside of mutant clones (ref \\"Drosophila Dscam is required for divergent segregation of sister branches and suppresses ectopic bifurcation of axons,\\" Neuron, 2002). The Q system allows for GAL4 independent MARCM by using the QF/QS system. Lethal MARCM allows for the generation of large marked homozygous populations by including a lethal mutation near the GAL80 site. Dual-expression control MARCM uses the LexA-VP16 transcriptional system in concordance with GAL4-UAS. MARCM is also often used as a genetic screen.

He had never taken a course in Nuclear Physics before arriving in Los Alamos. During World War II, Rosen worked in the Manhattan Project. Career While most of his colleagues at Los Alamos did not stay, Rosen remained there his entire career, and was still working there two days before his death. He built the most intense atom smasher in the world there, using a beam of protons to create an intense beam of pi meson (pion) particles. Rosen's machine was 1000 times more powerful than any previously existing particle accelerator, and was used to study the interaction of pions with other nuclear materials. He called his machine \\"a badly needed bridge between subnuclear and nuclear physics\\".Physics Today, 1966; quoted in Douglas Martin, \\"Louis Rosen, 91, Dies; Worked on First Nuclear Bombs\\", New York Times, September 5, 2009.

Only one was built. Development The Type D was the third and last of Handley Page's early single-seat monoplanes (the Type B being a biplane). It was a close relative of the Type A, which crashed on its first turn, and the Type C which did not fly at all. Like them the Type D used the wing patented by Jos√© Weiss that promised, but failed to deliver, automatic lateral stability. Its structure was based on a rigid inner section, built with four spars and standard ribs with a flexible outer section carried on ribs attached fanwise from the end of the spars in a bird-like fashion. The wing was braced by wires from a tall, narrow inverted V kingpost, lifting loads being carried by symmetrical bracing to a matching V post under the fuselage. This latter structure also carried the two-wheel single axle undercarriage and a long central skid to prevent nosing over and to hold the tail clear of the ground. After the Type A crash, Handley Page had added wing warping for lateral control to the Type C. The Type D also used this system, with a steering wheel pulling on wires to the mid-wing via the kingpost. The horizontal tail was an approximately 60¬∞ delta with rounded tips; most of the surface moved to form the single-piece elevator and carried the rudder post and split (above and below the elevator) rudder, so that all the control surfaces moved together as a cruciform piece. The elevator was operated by pushing or pulling the lever- mounted steering wheel and the rudder by a \\"foot tiller\\". There was no fixed fin. The Type D was built for the 1911 Olympia Aero Show and appeared there with a borrowed 35 hp (26 kW) liquid-cooled Green engine mounted tractor fashion in a semi-monocoque mahogany planked fuselage. This engine was not powerful enough to get the Type D into the air and a new canvas covered fuselage had to be built to house the 50 hp (37 kW) Isaacson from the Type C. It was entered into the Daily Mail Circuit of Britain race, starting on 22 July 1911 but crashed at the end of its first flight on 15 July. Appearing after repairs in yellow varnish, it was named The Antiseptic by Handley Page's new test pilot, Edward Petre, after the tincture of iodine commonly used on cuts in those days. In the Handley Page factory at Barking, north east London it was often called the Yellow Peril after the current nickname for Gold Flake cigarettes. It flew several times from a rented part of a sports field at Fairlop, six miles north of Barking, before Handley Page decided to concentrate on two-seaters with better sales prospects. Nonetheless, the Type D was the first Handley Page designed aircraft to fly successfully. In the retrospective redesignations of 1924 the Type D became the H.P.4.

It stars Fernandel, (with whom Duvivier had made two successful Don Camillo films earlier in the 1950s), and Bernard Blier. Plot The wife of Albert Constantin goes to visit her uncle, who is sick. Albert, (Fernandel), a clarinet player with the orchestra of the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet finds himself alone for a week. Albert finds it hard to cope, being domestically inept, and his colleague in the orchestra, √âmile, (Jean Rigaux), recommends he go to see √âva (Judith Magre). He, himself, sees her from time to time. At first hesitant, Albert goes to see the woman. So much the worse for Albert. √âva is murdered, while he waits to see her in her living-room. Realising √âva is a prostitute he hurries away, only to read the next day of a murder and reports of a man running away, in a raincoat, from the scene of the crime.

Biography Norman MacLeod of MacLeod was born on 18 July 1812 at Dunvegan, Skye. He was the son of John Norman MacLeod of MacLeod (1788‚Äì1835), 24th chief of Clan MacLeod and his wife Anne Stephenson (‚àí1861). He was educated at Harrow and then went abroad to Paris and Vienna. In 1835, when he was 23 years of age, his father died, and succeeded to the chiefship of Clan MacLeod. MacLeod of MacLeod attempted many costly improvements at Dunvegan Castle, as well as unsuccessful ventures in farming; and greatly encumbered the clan estates and thus ruined himself. During the enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859, a group from the South Kensington Museum, headed by Macleod, approached the War Office with an offer to raise two companies from the engineering and allied professions. The proposal was accepted in January 1860 and enlistment of the 1st Middlesex Engineers began on 6 February, creating the first Engineer Volunteer Corps. MacLeod was appointed Captain in command and a year later was promoted to Major and then Lieutenant-Colonel as the unit rapidly grew beyond its initial two companies. MacLeod relinquished command in 1871 and was appointed Honorary Colonel of the corps.Army List.Major D.K. Edwards, A History of the 1st Middlesex Volunteer Engineers (101 (London) Engineer Regiment, TA) 1860‚Äì1967, London, 1967, pp. 6‚Äì15, Appendix F. Family life In 1837, MacLeod of MacLeod married the Hon. Louisa Barbara St. John (1818‚Äì1880), only daughter of the 14th Baron St John of Bletso. In this first marriage, MacLeod of MacLeod had a daughter and four sons. His daughter Louisa married John Moyer Heathcote. In 1881 he married, secondly, Hanna, daughter of Baron von Ettingshausen (Austria). MacLeod of MacLeod had no children in his second marriage. Norman MacLeod of MacLeod died in Paris, France, on 5 February 1895; and was buried at Duirinish Church at Dunvegan. Succession of the chiefship after his death Norman MacLeod of MacLeod's eldest son, Norman Magnus MacLeod of MacLeod (1839‚Äì1929), succeeded him as 26th chief of the clan. The 26th chief died without male issue. Norman MacLeod of MacLeod's second eldest son, Torquil Olave (1841‚Äì1857) had earlier died without issue as well. Norman Magnus MacLeod of MacLeod was, therefore, succeeded by Norman MacLeod of MacLeod's third son, Sir Reginald MacLeod of MacLeod (1847‚Äì1935), as the 27th chief of Clan MacLeod. Sir Reginald MacLeod of MacLeod had no sons, but two daughters. After his death he was succeeded by his eldest daughter Dame Flora MacLeod of MacLeod (1878‚Äì1976), 28th chief and first female chief of the clan.

A highly gifted actress with a striking stage presence, Coates initially found success in larger dramatic roles before transitioning into portraying mainly character parts in the 1950s. She began her career with Lilian Baylis's opera company at the Old Vic in 1924. She stayed with the company when it moved to the Sadler's Wells Theatre and remained with them up to 1946. Coates career was put on hold while the London stages were closed during World War II. There is no doubt that the war limited her career as it occurred during her prime singing years; though she was also said not to have been excessively ambitious. In 1947 Coates joined the Royal Opera, London where she remained until her retirement from the stage in 1967. Biography Coates studied singing with Ethel Henry Bird at the Trinity College of Music in London and later with Clive Carey, Dawson Freer and Dino Borgioli. She began her career in 1924 with the Vic Wells Opera, first as a member of the chorus and then in smaller roles. When the company moved to the Sadler's Wells Theatre in 1931 she became the company's leading mezzo-soprano, notably singing in the UK premieres of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's The Snow Maiden (as Lel) and Rimsky-Korsakov's The Tale of Tsar Saltan (as Tkachikha) in 1933. She also had a tremendous success with the company as Princess Eboli in Giuseppe Verdi's Don Carlos in 1937. On 7 June 1945 she portrayed Auntie in the world premiere of Benjamin Britten's Peter Grimes at the Sadler's Wells Theatre. In 1937 Coates made her Covent Garden debut, but did not become a member of the company until a decade later. In 1947 she returned to the house to portray the title role in Georges Bizet's Carmen in the company's first full-scale production since the house was closed during World War II. She remained a member of the Royal Opera for the next two decades, initially portraying leading roles like Azucena in Il trovatore, Fricka in Die Walk√ºre, and Amneris in Aida. She eventually gravitated to character roles in the 1950s. While at the Royal Opera, Coates notably sang in several world premieres, including Madame Bardeau in Arthur Bliss's The Olympians (1949), the Housewife in Britten's Gloriana (1953), and the She-Ancient in Michael Tippett's The Midsummer Marriage (1955). She was also highly praised for her performance of the Countess in the first English-language production of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades (1950). She later portrayed 'Grandma' in the world premiere of Grace Williams‚Äôs The Parlour at the Welsh National Opera in 1966. Coates retired from the stage after the conclusion of the 1971 opera season. In 1977 she was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. Her husband, Powell Lloyd, was a tenor who later had success as an opera producer and set designer. In 1982 she was among a number of artists on stage at Covent Garden who congratulated Dame Eva Turner at a gala for Turner's 90th birthday.

The Trachtenberg School is one of the most prestigious schools of public policy and public management in the United States. US News & World Report University Rankings ranks the Trachtenberg School as the 10th best public affairs school in the United States and as having the 11th best public management program, the 14th best health policy program, and the 20th best social policy program in the U.S.U.S. News & World Report - GWU Rankings Notable alumni include numerous prominent political and public figures, including John Michael McConnell, former Director of National Intelligence, Susan Schwab, former United States Trade Representative, Henry Cisneros, former U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and Thad Allen, former Commandant of the Coast Guard. The Trachtenberg School offers Master of Public Policy, Master of Public Administration, Master of Arts in Environmental and Natural Resources Policy, and a PhD in Public Policy and Public Administration. The master‚Äôs programs integrate theory and practice in scholarship, teaching, and service and embrace multiple perspectives for advancing critical analysis and practical knowledge in the fields of public policy and public administration. History The Media and Public Affairs building. Education in public service and government began at George Washington University with the construction of the Hall of Government in 1927. The university gradually expanded its offerings in the field, and by 1950, public administration courses were offered in the School of Government, Department of Business, and the Department of Political Science. In 1953, the Department of Political Science organized these offerings into a Master of Arts in Public Administration degree. To address the call for professional training in public administration, in 1956, graduate level public administration courses were consolidated into the newly formed Department of Business and Public Administration in the School of Government. The school was subsequently reorganized in 1963 into the School of Government and Business Administration, including a Department of Public Administration. That same year, the department began offering a Master of Public Administration degree. The program consisted of 36 credit hours of coursework following the early guidelines of the National Association of Public Administration and Public Affairs. Further changes to the program expanded the course of study to a 40 credit hour program. The Columbian College of Arts and Sciences also established Masters of Public Policy and PhD in Public Policy programs. In 2003, all three programs were merged into the School of Public Policy and Public Administration within the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences. The School was recognized as one of the seven academic units designated as signature programs of selective excellence within the University. Most recently, in 2007, the university Board of Trustees renamed the School of Public Policy and Public Administration the Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and Public Administration in recognition of President-emeritus Stephen Joel Trachtenberg.School of Public Policy and Administration named after Trachtenberg Academics The Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and Public Administration offers master's degrees in public policy, public administration, and environmental and natural resource policy, as well as a PhD in Public Policy and Administration and certificates in Nonprofit Management, Environmental Resource Policy, and Budget & Public Finance. The Master of Public Administration (MPA) and Master of Public Policy (MPP) degrees each consist of a core curriculum and a field of study chosen by students.Master of Public AdministrationMaster of Public Policy Many of these fields of study are offered in partnership with other schools within the university, including the Elliott School of International Affairs, School of Public Health and Health Services, and Graduate School of Education & Human Development. The Trachtenberg School is one of only a few schools to offer both MPA and MPP degrees accredited by the National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration (NASPAA). The Master of Arts in Environmental and Natural Resources Policy (ENRP) builds upon the foundation of a public policy program with a focus on environmental and natural resource issues and concepts. The ENRP program offers a multidisciplinary approach to environmental and sustainability studies, with a core curriculum that includes environmental economics, environmental law, public policy and policy analysis, research methods, and environmental sciences. The PhD in Public Policy and Public Administration offers a rigorous multidisciplinary curriculum that prepares students for careers in university teaching and research, research institutions, federal, state, and local governments, and international organizations.PhD in Public Policy and Public Administration In addition to developing broad analytical skills in multiple subjects, students take courses designed to prepare them to undertake research in specific areas of public policy and administration. Through course work in each specialized field, students develop expertise for a variety of careers in the public and private sectors. In addition to degrees offered solely by the Trachtenberg School, the school offers combined MPA/JD and MPP/JD degree programs with The George Washington University Law School and a joint MPP/PhD with the Department of Political Science, as well as various combined Bachelor of Arts/MPP and BA/MPA degrees for undergraduates.

Biography Described as \\"one of Toronto's great blues singers from the late '60s to the mid-'80s\\",Toronto Blues Society, Notice of Death of John Witmer , \\"Loose Blues News\\", September 2004;www.torontobluessociety.com. with \\"a raspy vocal style\\",John Valenteyn, John's Blues Picks , October 2005, in describing Witmer's vocal style as comparable to that of Robert Johnson, of the more recent band Blues Tribe ; www.torontobluessociety.com. John Witmer co-founded the seminal Canadian blues band, Whiskey Howl in 1969, when he was eighteen years old.Whiskey Howl ‚Äì The First Year 1969‚Äì70 ; www.livinblues.com. The Toronto-based Whiskey Howl, along with the Downchild Blues Band, also formed in 1969, were two of the principal influences in the development of Canadian blues music. One of Witmer's first professional engagements with Whiskey Howl was as one of the acts playing at the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival in September 1969. This was a one-day festival, featuring an historic appearance by John Lennon and The Plastic Ono Band, and which resulted in the release of the album Live Peace in Toronto 1969. Despite the early success and promise of Whiskey Howl, the band broke up as of 1972, shortly after the release of their first album. Witmer continued to sing locally through the balance of the 1970s, rejoining Whiskey Howl for a reunion concert that resulted in the band's second album release, Live at The El Mocambo, in 1981. Between 1982 and 1986, Witmer was the lead singer of the Downchild Blues Band, one of three singersThe others being Tony Flaim (d. 2000, heart attack, age 52) and Chuck Jackson. Jackson succeeded Hock Walsh permanently as of 1990, when Walsh was fired for a final time by Downchild co-founder and brother Donnie Walsh; see Downchild Blues Band. who replaced Downchild co-founder Richard \\"Hock\\" Walsh,Who died on New Year's Eve, 1999, at the age of 51, of an apparent heart attack. during various periods when Walsh either left the band or was fired as Downchild's lead singer.See general description of Downchild lead singer succession at Downchild Blues Band. He recorded one album with Downchild, But I'm on the Guest List (1982), recorded live at Toronto's El Mocambo club, after Downchild had regrouped following the death of band member Jane Vasey.Who died in July 1982, at the age of 32, of leukemia. Witmer relocated to Vancouver in the late 1980s, where he joined The BelAirs, a band that existed between 1985 and 1995, after which it became known as The Fabricators.Profile of The BelAirs ; www.belairs.net.See Profile of The Fabricators at Pacific Northwest Bands; www.pnwbands.com. The Fabricators were described by the West Coast Blues Review as \\"one of Vancouver's hottest R&B; acts\\". The music with which Witmer was associated at the time was described as \\"the raw & powerful Delta and Chicago blues, rhythmic New Orleans and Tex-Mex tunes, old rock and roll gems, the smooth urban sounds of Detroit and Philadelphia, as well as many original compositions.\\"Liner notes to Vancouver BC's Best Blues, Vol. 1; www.rawrecords.com. During this same period and for the last fifteen years of his life, Witmer was an employee of the British Columbia Institute of Technology, where he worked with Larry Smith, co-founder of The BelAirs and The Fabricators.E-mail correspondence with Larry Smith, co- founder of The BelAirs and The Fabricators, September 2009. The Fabricators, established in 1995 as a successor band to The BelAirs, broke up in 2002, and was Witmer's last band. He ceased performing after the band's breakup. Witmer died suddenly two years later, on July 3, 2004, at the age of 53.

This period ended with the Southern Court definitively losing the war, and they were forced to completely submit sovereignty to the Northern Court. This had the result that, while later Japanese sovereigns were descended from the Northern Court, posterity assigns sole legitimacy during this period to the Southern Court. The Southern descendants are also known as the \\"junior line\\" and the , Daikaku-ji being the cloistered home of Go-Uda, a Southern ruler. Because it was based in Yoshino, Nara, it is also called the . Nanboku-ch≈ç overview The Imperial seats during the Nanboku-ch≈ç period were in relatively close proximity, but geographically distinct. They were conventionally identified as: The genesis of the Northern Court go back to Emperor Go-Saga, who reigned from 1242 through 1246.Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). Annales des empereurs du japon, pp. 245-247. Go-Saga was succeeded by two of his sons, Emperor Go- FukakusaTitsingh, pp. 248-255. and Emperor Kameyama, who took turns on the throne.Titsingh, pp. 255-261. This was because on his death bed in 1272, Go- Saga had insisted that his sons adopt a plan in which future emperors from the two fraternal lines would ascend the throne in alternating succession.Titsingh, p. 261. This plan proved to be unworkable, resulting in rival factions and rival claimants to the throne. Northern Court In 1333, when the Southern Emperor Go-Daigo staged the Kenmu Restoration and revolted against the Kamakura shogunate, the sh≈çgun responded by declaring Emperor K≈çgon, Go-Daigo's second cousin once removed and the son of an earlier emperor, Emperor Go-Fushimi of the Jimy≈çin-t≈ç, as the new emperor. After the destruction of the Kamakura shogunate in 1333, K≈çgon lost his claim, but his brother, Emperor K≈çmy≈ç, and two of his sons were supported by the new Ashikaga sh≈çguns as the rightful claimants to the throne. K≈çgon's family thus formed an alternate Imperial Court in Kyoto, which came to be called the Northern Court because its seat was in a location north of its rival. During the Meiji period, an Imperial decree dated March 3, 1911 established that the legitimate reigning monarchs of this period were the direct descendants of Emperor Go- Daigo through Emperor Go-Murakami, whose Southern Court had been established in exile in Yoshino, near Nara.Thomas, Julia Adeney. (2001). Reconfiguring modernity: concepts of nature in Japanese political ideology, p. 199 n57, citing Mehl, Margaret. (1997). History and the State in Nineteenth-Century Japan. p. 140-147. The Northern Court established in Kyoto by Ashikaga Takauji is therefore considered illegitimate. Northern Pretenders These are the Hokuch≈ç or Northern Court emperors: *Emperor K≈çgon 1332‚Äì1333.Titsingh, pp. 286‚Äì289. * - *Emperor K≈çmy≈ç 1336‚Äì1348.Titsingh, pp. 294‚Äì298. *Emperor Suk≈ç 1348‚Äì1351.Titsingh, pp. 298‚Äì301. *- *Emperor Go-K≈çgon 1352‚Äì1371.Titsingh, pp. 302‚Äì309. *Emperor Go-En'y≈´ 1371‚Äì1382.Titsingh, pp. 310‚Äì316, 320. *Emperor Go- Komatsu 1382‚Äì1392 (then went on to reign as legitimate emperor 1392‚Äì1412)Titsingh, pp. 317‚Äì327. The Imperial Court supported by the Ashikaga sh≈çguns was rivaled by the Southern Court of Go-Daigo and his descendants. This came to be called the Southern Court because its seat was in a location south of its rival. Although the precise location of the emperors' seat did change, it was often identified as simply Yoshino. In 1392, Emperor Go- Kameyama of the Southern Court was defeated and abdicated in favor of K≈çgon's great-grandson, Emperor Go-Komatsu, thus ending the divide. But the Northern Court was under the power of the Ashikaga sh≈çguns and had little real independence. Partly because of this, since the 19th century, the Emperors of the Southern Imperial Court have been considered the legitimate Emperors of Japan. Moreover, the Southern Court controlled the Japanese imperial regalia. The Northern Court members are officially called pretenders. One Southern Court descendant, Kumazawa Hiromichi, declared himself to be Japan's rightful Emperor in the days after the end of the Pacific War. He claimed that Emperor Hirohito was a fraud, arguing that Hirohito's entire line is descended from the Northern Court. Despite this, he was not arrested for l√®se-majest√©, even when donning the Imperial Crest. He could and did produce a koseki detailing his bloodline back to Go-Daigo in Yoshino, but his claims and rhetoric failed to inspire anything other than sympathy.Dower, John W. (1999).

However, Go-Komatsu broke this promise, not only ruling for 20 years, but being succeeded by his own son, rather than by one from the former Southern Court.  Notes  References  * Dower, John W.

It sails between Hirtshals, Denmark to T√≥rshavn, the Faroe Islands and Sey√∞isfj√∂r√∞ur, Iceland.  Travel to the Faroe Islands and Iceland  Today there are only two options for travel to or from the Faroe Islands as an ordinary passenger: One way is to fly with Scandinavian Airlines or with the Faroese national airline Atlantic Airways, and the other way is to sail with the ferry Norr√∂na from the Faroese ferry company Smyril Line, whose home port is T√≥rshavn on the Faroe Islands. The trip from Denmark to the Faroe Islands directly takes approximately 36 hours and from T√≥rshavn on the Faroe Islands to Sey√∞isfj√∂r√∞ur on Iceland takes approximately 18 hours. Meanwhile, Norr√∂na is the only way to take your own car with you to the Faroe Islands and Iceland from Denmark or from the Faroe Islands and Iceland and reverse.  The old Norr√∂na  The old Norr√∂na was built in 1973 at Nobiskrug in Rendsburg in Germany as Gustav Wasa. From 1984 she was called the Norr√∂na and sailed for the owner Smyril Line between Denmark, the Faroe Islands, Iceland and Norway, and in some years Shetland also. The successor is the new Norr√∂na (from 2003). But the old ship is still sailing under the flag of the Faroe Islands, as a missionary ship under the name Logos Hope. The new Norr√∂na  The new Norr√∂na is a modern cruiseferry. It was built in L√ºbeck, Germany, and had its maiden voyage in April 2003. Norr√∂na has a total LOA (length overall) of , and a width of ; with lifeboats. She has a total of 318 passenger cabins and 72 crew cabins, which accommodates the space of approximately 1,482 passengers and 118 crew members. She has a total of of trailer lane, with space for 800 cars or 130 cargo trailers.http://www.smyrilline.com/about-us/the-board Her cruising speed is approximately . For passengers the ship is equipped with restaurants, a swimming pool, a small cinema and a fitness centre. Room types include cabins for two, cabins for families, connecting cabins, single berths in a four-person cabin and a dorm-style space with shared bathroom.https://www.smartertravel.com/2017/06/19/getting-around-iceland- transportation-tips/ The ferry observes ocean currents and water properties in the North Sea, the Faroe-Shetland Channel and the Iceland-Faroe Ridge for the American Geophysical Union.  In the winter months  The ferry also sails in the winter months, but there are few tourists on these trips and therefore only a crew of 20‚Äì25 is needed. In the winter months the ferry also changes from being a luxury ship to be more of a container ship. The ferry has visited Newcastle upon Tyne, England, as a Christmas shopping special, allowing visitors a day in the city.  Operation in adverse weather conditions When the weather is bad on the Faroe Islands, the ship may dock at the alternative ports of Klaksv√≠k or Runav√≠k instead of T√≥rshavn. In November 2007 the Norr√∂na lost power in heavy seas near the Shetland Islands; the ferry began to roll and eighty cars were damaged on the car deck. The ship was forced to stop at Lerwick for emergency repairs to the heavily damaged stabilisers.  Accidents  In January 2004 there was an accident with the new Norr√∂na in T√≥rshavn, when the ferry hit the wharf and suffered slight damage.Olivant.fo, photos from the accident On 8 April 1990 the old MS Norrona suffered a small deliberate fire in the passenger accommodation resulting in several casualties, The ferry was on loan to B&I; ferries (now Irish Ferries)running between Pembroke Dock & Rosslare.

He is credited as \\"an architect of the modern tax system.\\" Biography Paul, the grandson of a butcher, was born in Hackensack, New Jersey on August 8, 1890 to Charles B. and Martha Evernghim Paul. He worked his way through Amherst College (Class of 1911), and received his law degree from New York Law School in 1913. He began his career as a switchboard operator and, later, as an insurance adjuster. Law career Early law career In 1918, Paul happened upon an advertisement placed by one George E. Holmes soliciting assistance in Holmes' specialty practice in federal income tax law, a still novel concentration in the years just following adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Though lacking any background in the field, Paul answered the ad, got the job, and within two years had become a name partner in the firm. Over the next twenty years, the firm's name underwent various changes: first Holmes, Paul and Havens; then Holmes, Lynn, Paul and Havens; then Olcott, Holmes, Glass, Paul and Havens; and finally Olcott, Paul and Havens. In 1938, Paul left his small firm to form the tax law department at one of New York's oldest and then-largest firms, Lord, Day & Lord. By this time, Paul was a pioneer in establishing tax law as an integral component of a full-service Wall Street law firm. He was the author of the leading treatise on tax law in the United States (the six-volume Law of Federal Taxation with Jacob Mertens, and successive editions of Studies in Federal Taxation), and a visiting Sterling Professor of Law at Yale Law School. Civil service In 1940, he was named a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the first tax lawyer ever to occupy the position. Throughout the 1930s, Paul served as a part-time advisor to U.S. Secretary of Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr. Five days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Paul finally accepted previously-declined entreaties to work full-time for the U.S. Treasury Department. First as special assistant to the Secretary for the Tax Division, and later as the Department's General Counsel, Acting Secretary of the Treasury for Foreign Funds Control, and the Roosevelt Administration's chief spokesperson on tax matters on Capitol Hill, Paul convinced Morgenthau to embrace Keynesian principles and to consider taxation as a vehicle for social progress. To this end, Paul was instrumental in defeating attempts to enact a regressive national sales tax and in transforming the federal income tax into the broad-based revenue source and tool of fiscal policy that exists today. The Government's existing income tax system ‚Äì in which taxpayers need not pay their tax bill for one year until the next, when the value of the dollar had fallen ‚Äì exacerbated the problem. The confluence of these events required an exceptional solution, which the Paul-written Revenue Act of 1942 addressed. Paul is credited with modernizing the Internal Revenue Code and persuading Congress to enact the payroll withholding tax. Paul's role in the creation of the War Refugee Board Paul was also the principal sponsor of the first contemporaneous Government paper attacking America's dormant complicity in The Holocaust. Entitled \\"Report to the Secretary on the Acquiescence of This Government in the Murder of the Jews\\", written by Josiah DuBois, the document was an indictment of the U.S. State Department's diplomatic, military, and immigration policies. Among other things, the Report narrated the State Department's inaction and in some instances active opposition to the release of funds for the rescue of Jews in Romania and occupied France, and condemned immigration policies that closed American doors to Jewish refugees from countries then engaged in their systematic slaughter. The catalyst for the Report was an incident involving 70,000 Jews whose evacuation from Romania could have been procured with a $170,000 bribe. The Foreign Funds Control unit of the Treasury, which was within Paul's jurisdiction, authorized the payment of the funds, the release of which both the President and Secretary of State Cordell Hull supported. From mid-July 1943, when the proposal was made and Treasury approved, through December 1943, a combination of the State Department's bureaucracy and the British Ministry of Economic Warfare interposed various obstacles. The Report was the product of frustration over that event. On January 16, 1944, Morgenthau and Paul personally delivered the paper to President Roosevelt, warning him that Congress would act if he did not. The result was Executive Order 9417 creating the War Refugee Board composed of the Secretaries of State, Treasury and War. Issued on January 22, 1944, the Executive Order declared that \\"it is the policy of this Government to take all measures within its power to rescue the victims of enemy oppression who are in imminent danger of death and otherwise to afford such victims all possible relief and assistance consistent with the successful prosecution of the war.\\" Paul's Role in Post-WWII Negotiations with the Swiss President Truman appointed Randolph Paul chief negotiator with the Swiss concerning Nazi assets under Swiss control. In spring 1946 Paul requested permission to threaten Switzerland with economic sanctions as a means of pressuring it to turn over Nazi assets that remained under Swiss control. Permission was refused and Paul was instructed to accept Switzerland's offer, which was based on Switzerland's much lower estimate of the amount of Nazi loot in Switzerland. Return to private practice Paul left the Treasury Department in September 1944 to rejoin Lord, Day & Lord. Eighteen months later, he accepted an invitation to join a law firm then known as Cohen, Cole, Weiss & Wharton and which became, with the addition of Paul and Lloyd K. Garrison, the firm of Paul, Weiss, Wharton & Garrison. Based on his reputation gained in the Treasury Department, Paul attracted such blue- chip clients as Ford, General Motors, Standard Oil of California, Brown Shoe Company, B.V.D. Company, Reader's Digest, Union Sulpher Company, and the estates of the rich and famous. In addition to his private practice, Paul continued writing, including Taxation for Prosperity (1947), a studied argument for postwar maintenance of a progressive income tax; The History of Taxation in the United States (1953); and dozens of articles for journals such as The Harvard Law Review, The Yale Law Journal, The Tax Law Review and The Tax Lawyer. Paul maintained a teaching schedule as an adjunct professor at Harvard and Howard University Law Schools, among others. He briefly returned to government service as a part-time Special Assistant to President Truman for tax policy and later as the President's envoy to the negotiations between Switzerland and the Allied Powers on Nazi assets in Switzerland ‚Äì a controversy that stayed alive for a half century after his death. He was a frequent witness before congressional committees on tax and fiscal policy, testifying on the proper role of taxation in the Nation's social and fiscal programs. Death On February 6, 1956, Paul was testifying before a Joint Committee of the U.S. Congress on President Eisenhower's Economic Report. Having completed his prepared text, Paul began to answer a question when he slumped forward, dead of a heart attack.

It was native to the island of Jamaica in the Caribbean, where it probably inhabited dry forests in the island's south during the early Holocene. This species was described based on fossils discovered in the Skeleton Cave in the Jackson's Bay Cave system on the south coast of Portland Ridge. Caracara tellustris was large and had diminished wings; it was probably mostly terrestrial and may have been flightless. It probably had a lifestyle similar to that of the secretary bird of Africa. It likely became extinct following Paleo-Indian colonization of the island during the Quaternary extinction event, but it may have survived up to European colonization of the island, after which habitat destruction and invasive species wiped it out before it could be described by naturalists.

Forming out of a tropical wave on September 3, Babe began as a subtropical cyclone in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The storm gradually intensified as it tracked westward. On September 5, the storm turned north and acquired tropical characteristics. Later that day, Babe intensified into a hurricane and attained its peak strength with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 995 mbar (hPa; 29.38 inHg). Several hours later, the hurricane made landfall in Louisiana and quickly weakened. By September 6, Babe had weakened to a tropical depression and later dissipated early on September 9 over North Carolina. Hurricane Babe produced minimal impact throughout its path in the United States. The most significant impact occurred in Louisiana where the storm caused $10 million (1977 USD; $ USD) in damage, mainly from crop losses. An additional $3 million (1977 USD; $ USD) in losses resulted from tornadoes spawned by Babe. Heavy rainfall in North Carolina, peaking at triggered flash flooding but little damage. No fatalities resulted from the hurricane. Coincidentally, a typhoon, also named Babe, existed at exactly the same time as Hurricane Babe. Meteorological history alt=A map of a path through the Gulf of Mexico and the southeastern United States. Most of Mexico can be seen on the bottom left side and the Greater Antilles are present at the bottom right. Additionally, most of New England is visible at the top of the map. Hurricane Babe originated from a tropical wave that exited the western coast of Africa on August 23\\\\. Tracking westward, the wave eventually entered the Gulf of Mexico on September 2\\\\. Upon entering the gulf, a surface circulation developed; however, convection associated with the system was not concentrated around the center. The newly formed system then interacted with an upper tropospheric cyclonic vortex situated near the Florida coastline. The following day, Convective banding features around the cyclone led to the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgrading the system to Tropical Storm Babe. Although classified a tropical storm, Babe was not fully tropical, it was later classified as a subtropical cyclone. The forward motion of Babe had slowed significantly from when it was a wave but maintained the westward direction. By September 4, the maximum winds were found closer to the center of circulation and the cyclone developed a warmer core, a main feature in tropical cyclones. An anticyclone also developed over Babe and later that day, the storm transitioned into a tropical cyclone. By this time, Babe had turned nearly due north and was near hurricane-status. Around this time, reconnaissance missions into the storm found a closed eyewall with an eye measuring roughly 23 mi (37 km) in diameter. Another reconnaissance flight that day found sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h); however, these winds were located roughly 65 mi (100 km) from the center and considered to be unrepresentative of the storm's actual intensity. Early on September 5, reconnaissance found a central barometric pressure of 995 mbar (hPa; 29.38 inHg), the lowest recorded in relation to the storm. Around this time, Babe also intensified into a hurricane, attaining maximum winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). Later that day, Hurricane Babe made landfall near Cocodrie, Louisiana and quickly weakened to a tropical storm. By landfall, the eye of Babe had contracted to roughly 14 mi (23 km). On September 6, the storm had weakened to a tropical depression and was moving northeast into Mississippi. The system continued this movement for the following two days. While crossing South Carolina, forecasters thought that the system would emerge into the Atlantic Ocean and regenerate into a tropical depression. However, the remnants of Babe dissipated shortly before crossing into North Carolina early on September 9. Preparations alt=A map of rainfall in the southeastern United States. The heaviest rainfall is in southern Louisiana and a band of equally heavy rain stretches into North Carolina. Upon the storm's formation on September 3, gale warnings were issued for areas along the north-central coast of the Gulf of Mexico. By September 5, hurricane warnings were posted for areas between Vermilion Bay to the mouth of the Mississippi River in Louisiana. These warnings were later discontinued as the system moved over land. Ahead of the storm, up to 30,000 residents in low-lying parts of the state moved inland. However, press reports indicate that upwards of 45,000 residents had evacuated from coastal regions prior to the storm. In Grand Isle, roughly 200 civil defense workers stayed behind in the town hall after the cities 2,300 residents evacuated. In Cameron Parish, roughly 8,000 residents evacuated inland. Emergency shelters were set up throughout Louisiana to house evacuees during the storm. As Hurricane Babe began to weaken over Louisiana, forecasters anticipated the formation of tornadoes and issued tornado watches for parts of Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia and Florida. Impact alt=Satellite image of a poorly defined, dissipating tropical cyclone over North Carolina. The image shows a large portion of the United States east of the Rockies and part of Mexico as well as southern Canada. Another, better defined cyclone is visible on the right side of the image. Prior to becoming a subtropical depression, Babe produced scattered rainfall in Florida, with peak amounts near falling around Lake Okeechobee. Widespread rain fell in relation to Babe throughout the Southern United States. In Louisiana, rain was confined to eastern parts of the state, with up to being measured near the Mississippi border. The remnants of the hurricane continued to produce heavy rain through its dissipation over North Carolina. A storm peak of fell in Lafayette, Georgia. Most of North Carolina received between of rain with isolated areas exceeding . A state maximum of fell in Lake Toxaway, North Carolina, in Caesars Head, South Carolina and in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Upon making landfall, Babe produced a storm surge of , leading to minor coastal flooding. Due to the storm's quick deterioration after moving inland, the NHC presumed that hurricane-force winds did not impact land. The highest wind gust was recorded in Grand Isle, Louisiana at 50 mph (85 km/h) and the highest sustained wind was recorded in Boothville, Louisiana at 45 mph (75 km/h). In Jean Lafitte, Louisiana, overflow from the Fleming Canal produced flooding throughout the area. The most significant damage was to croplands inundated by flood waters. Flash flooding occurred throughout the path of the former hurricane in the eastern United States, particularly in North Carolina. Hurricane Babe produced 14 tornadoes between September 5 and 7 along its track in several states. Louisiana recorded the most, with six touchdowns,These figures are derived by adding totals documented in individual event reports. See including one F2 that injured one person and caused $2.5 million (1977 USD; $ USD) in damages near Hammond in Tangipahoa Parish. A country store sustained severe damage from the tornado, with most of the back of the store destroyed. Six wood-frame homes were also knocked off their cinder block supports. Another F2 touched down in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama; however, minimal damage was recorded along its track. Another F2 briefly touched down in Harrison County, Mississippi on September 6. It struck an unoccupied elementary school, wrecking six classrooms and leaving $500,000 (1977 USD; $ USD) in damages. Throughout the storm's path, damages amounted to $10 million (1977 USD; $ USD) with an additional $3 million (1977 USD; $ USD) from tornadoes. There was no loss of life due to Babe.

It is the first medical school of its kind in the nation. The OU School of Community Medicine is designed to serve the healthcare needs of entire communities, especially vulnerable and underserved populations. OUSCM is guided by the growing need for more physicians focused on serving vulnerable populations, the growing number of people without access to quality health care, and the relatively poor health status of Oklahomans.OU School of Community Medicine Homepage History The University of Oklahoma College of Medicine was founded in 1900 and is located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. In 1974, the OU College of Medicine opened a geographically separate, community-based clinical campus in Tulsa, approximately 100 miles northeast of the main campus. At the Tulsa campus, known as the OU Tulsa Schusterman Center, programs are affiliated with three community hospitals: Hillcrest Medical Center, Saint Francis Hospital, and St. John Medical Center. In 2008 a $50 million transformational gift from the George Kaiser Family Foundation allowed the OU College of Medicine Tulsa to change its focus. The gift established the OU School of Community Medicine with the goal of improving public health in Oklahoma, where citizens face critical challenges in access to quality healthcare. The school is seeking faculty and students from within Oklahoma and around the nation who have a specific interest in public health and community service. Students learn the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of acute and chronic diseases in whole communities, as well as the full range of primary care and sub-specialties offered in traditional medical programs. On December 1, 2009, OU president David Boren and University of Tulsa president Steadman Upham jointly announced that the two universities would collaborate to create a four-year medical school in Tulsa.Kim Archer, \\"TU, OU team up for med school\\", Tulsa World, December 2, 2009. In 2012 it was announced that the Oxley Foundation would donate $30 million toward the development of the OU/TU medical school. The expanded four-year program accepted its first students in the fall of 2015. Part of this expansion includes the construction of a new state-of-the-art medical simulation training facility named the Tandy Education Center. The construction of this 16,000 square foot facility was made possible by a donation from the A.R. and Marylouise Tandy Foundation. OUSCM Summer Institute The OUSCM Summer Institute is an innovative, experiential examination of health care delivery in Tulsa held annually in late summer. Participants in the institute ‚Äì one of only two of its kind in the country ‚Äì include first and second- year University of Oklahoma medical students, physician assistant students, students from the OU Colleges of Social Work, Pharmacy and Nursing, and faculty members. The institute allows participants to take an in-depth look at community medicine from a range of perspectives and develop solutions to problems they identify during the week‚Äôs experience. Some students and faculty who attended past Summer Institutes have called the experience life-changing on many levels, but particularly in deepening their understanding of the needs of the medically vulnerable and the goals of making entire communities healthier. OU Tulsa Community Health (Bedlam Clinics) Community Health, nicknamed the Bedlam Clinics, is an innovative, collaborative program that has provided affordable healthcare to the indigent and underserved in Tulsa county since 2003. When the first Bedlam (now known as Community Health) clinic opened, Tulsa faced a plunging economy with more than 25,000 jobs lost in just 18 months. Consequently, healthcare coverage was lost, and hospital emergency rooms became critically overtaxed. Seeing a community in need, the OU School of Community Medicine took a leadership role in facing this crisis and finding a solution. In addition, the model provides an essential teaching component to OU medical, pharmacy, social work, and nursing students. Hands-on training strengthens clinical skills, overall curriculum, and cultural competency while instilling an appreciation for volunteerism and efficient clinic operation. Students Students at the OU School of Community Medicine are given the opportunity to take advantage of Educational grants and forgiveness for service. OUSCM Students are also allowed to take graduate public health courses leading to an MPH or Public Health Certificate at no cost to the student. Students are recruited from all over the country - with an interest in public health and care for the underserved medical community. Applicants are admitted to OU College of Medicine and select the OU School of Community Medicine track. OUSCM students are given the opportunity to take part in clinical experiences at both the Bedlam Evening and Bedlam Longitudinal clinics (Community Health Clinics), gaining experience working with the underserved and medically vulnerable. Students can also participate in clinical experiences at school based clinics in addition to clinical rotations in a multitude of practice areas. Faculty and Resident Fellows Over 150 OU School of Community Medicine faculty are housed in 10 residency programs and departments including: Family Medicine, Emergency Medicine, Pediatrics, Internal Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Psychiatry, Internal Medicine/Pediatrics, Medical Informatics, and Rural Family Medicine. Clinical faculty are part of OU Physicians, an academic group practice that is part of the OU School of Community Medicine. OU Physicians enables its members to provide excellent patient service and care, enhance OU's community mission to teach tomorrow's physicians and develop innovative health care services. Resident Fellows, Faculty, and Staff at the OU School of Community Medicine participate in Leadership Courses to enhance expertise in principles of community health and clinical teaching.

The RD-0146 engine was developed by KBKhA design bureau in Voronezh, Russia, in cooperation with the American Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne company. In 2009, it came into prominence, as Russian space agency chose it for the second-stage of the proposed Rus-M launch vehicle designed to carry the future Russian PPTS crewed spacecraft. After the cancellation of Rus-M rocket, the RD-0146D variant was selected as the powerplant for the KVTK upper stage. Development In 1999, Khrunichev requested KBKhA to develop RD-0146U version of the engine for Proton and Angara rockets. The development of the engine was partially financed by Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne. Pratt & Whitney signed a preliminary marketing agreement on April 7, 2000 with Russia's Chemical Automatics Design Bureau giving Pratt & Whitney exclusive international marketing rights to the RD-0146. Description The RD-0146 is the first Russian rocket engine not to feature a gas generator and to be equipped with extendable nozzle extension without a cooling system. The engine is capable of five firings and thrust control in two planes. According to the developer, the lack of a gas generator system ensures higher reliability of the engine for multiple firings, by removing the potential of an ignition failure in the engine power cycle.

The assailants boarded a minibus that was intercepted by police officers of the Carabineros de Chile, sparking an assault that resulted in the death of a further seven persons: 3 attackers, 3 passengers on the bus and a police officer. A further 12 people were wounded.  Background  Although by 1993 Chile had officially become a democracy, the Chilean military remained highly powerful and the Constitution of Chile ensured the continued influence of General Augusto Pinochet and his military commanders. This prevented President Patricio Aylwin's government from achieving many of the goals it had set out to achieve, such as the restructuring of the Constitutional Court of Chile and the reduction of Pinochet's political power. In spite of the severe limits imposed on Aylwin's government by the Constitution, over four years, it \\"altered power relations in its favor in the state, in civil society, and in political society.\\"Linz, Juan J. & Stepan, Alfred. Problems of Democratic Transition and Consolidation. Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996.

Kushner, Page 220, Sage Publications, 2003  The Incident  On October 21, 1993, (Living and Dying in the '90s: Isidora Stevenson's monologue at GAM) a group of five members of the Lautaro guerrilla movement robbed a branch of Banco O'HIggins, located at Avenida Apoquindo 6417. According to the survivors, the purpose of the robbery was to seize funds for the rescue of political prisoners. The robbers managed to escape on a minibus running on Santiago bus route 24-C, which was stopped by the police near Avenida Manquehue. Shooting broke out, Alt URL in the course of which seven people, three robbers, three bus passengers and one policeman, were killed and 12 people were injured. Two police officers were arrested and prosecuted for making reckless use of their service weapons. According to ballistic tests, the minibus, in which there were more than 20 passengers, received between 162 and 300 bullet holes, according to differing sources.  Impact of events  The government of the time, led by President Patricio Aylwin, endorsed the actions of the police. The senator Sergio Onofre Jarpa said, \\"this is like a war. They declared it and you have to face them at whatever cost.\\"  Trial  Eight years later, the military court handed down verdicts, sentencing the two survivors, Alvaro Gonzalez and Oriana Alcayaga, to a total of 81 years and 61 years imprisonment respectively. Two Carabineros arrested in connection with the shootings later received suspended sentences of 541 and 240 days.

The band was founded in 2007. Best known JetRockers' performance is a first open-air concert in 2007, second in 2008 and third in 2009, all in Lviv. History JetRockers were founded by Vasyl Mylko and Serhii Otroshchenko. The very beginnings start out in 2007 in Lviv, at software company SoftServe, when Vasyl Mylko, Strategic Business Unit (SBU) Manager of JetLab, was interviewing Serhii Otroshchenko. Serhii was a SoftServe University graduate, while JetLab lacked resources. So during the interview Vasyl asked if Serhii played some instruments or at least painted. Serhii answered affirmative. It happened that Vasyl had an electric guitar and an amplifier in the office, so they were given to the interviewee for some performance. Serhii played something from Kreator and Malmsteen and thus was hired to JetLab. The band name was invented to be JetRockers. There was an idea that all JetRockers members had to be from the same JetLab team. It was so till 2008. Bass guitar, Roman Bilusiak, joined the band soon, he is from musicians family. Vitaliy Topolnytskyy joined as a drummer. In Summer 2007 JetLab team went to Shatsky ozera for barbecue, JetRockers took all the gear. There was first big sound check and the casting for vocals. Khrystyna Kosyk succeeded as a singer of rock compositions, Vyacheslav Dyak was selected for heavy metal and punk rock songs. It is supposed that band played successfully, which was confirmed by the random listeners from the recreation area Shatsky ozera. Rehearsal delayed till the late night. Then new drummer was invited, Ivan Lutsyk. Interesting fact is that Vasyl Mylko got references to him from Roman Figel from JetLab, and found Ivan in the corporate gym, training judo. Ivan agreed to join JetRockers if Vasyl buys the drums. Vasyl bought Sonor drums, Ivan joined instantly. Then Galyna Stasiuk joined the band for vocals. This staff performed in 2007 and had big success locally. Later in 2007 drummer Ivan Lutsyk decided to leave the band as he wanted to develop as a guitar player. Vyacheslav Dyak proposed his colleague drummer Mykola Glibovych. Vasyl interviewed Mykola in summer 2007 with intention to hire to JetLab SBU. Of course, Mykola had to play the drums right in the office just after the interview, and most of present people were surprised that Mykola played so loud. But it was negotiated that Mykola would be ready after the training in SoftServe University, so he joined the band in February 2008. Then was a time of vocals rotations. Olena Strelchenko used to sing for a while. Eventually JetRockers welcomed Olga Didukh (then she changed her last name to Moroz after her husband). Oleksandr Sukholeyster joined JetRockers as keyboards player. This staff played in 2008 and achieved even better appreciation because of higher quality of both sound and performance. JetRockers plays on SoftServe Company Day. It is annual celebration that takes place in Buhta Vikingiv resort, ~20 kilometers from Lviv. In 2007 JetRockers played as the opener for the famous Ukrainian band Tartak in front of more than 1000 people. In 2008 JetRockers played as the opener for another Ukrainian headliner Skryabin. JetRockers did not play in 2009 due to the different place of company day celebration, hence unavailability of the big scene for the planned performance. There are opinions that it was linked to the Economic crisis of 2008. Recent considerable performance took place at Millennium night club in Lviv on December 26, 2009. Current line-up includes new drummer Rustam Iskandarov (he also plays in Black Jack) and bass player Andriy Savchyn (he also plays in Fayno).

As time passes in the story the concoction is less prominent, until the time of World War II, when the now-aged Martha Dinwiddie Butterfield donates her father's original formula for Lohocla to the United States government, which uses it in the atomic bombs dropped on Japan. *In Rocket Boys (and the follow-on movie) by Homer H. Hickam Jr., moonshine plays a role in one of the home-made rocket fuels the protagonists create. In order to obtain it, they wind up getting drunk. Movies *In the 1924 cartoon Felix Finds Out, Felix the Cat is asked by his friend Willie to find out what makes the moon shine which is the latter's homework.

It also included the Eastern Caribbean territories of Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, the Windward Islands and the Leeward Islands. From the early 19th century to the later 20th century, the region generally used sterling coinage, although there was quite widespread usage of mixed sterling and dollar accounts. In the later 20th century there was a move towards dollar accounts in all the territories, in conjunction with the introduction of decimal fractional coinage. Early history Queen Anne's proclamation of 1704 introduced the gold standard to the British West Indies, putting the West Indies about two hundred years ahead of the East Indies in that respect. Nevertheless, silver pieces of eight continued to form an important portion of the circulating coinage until the great silver devaluation of 1873. In addition to the Spanish dollars and gold doubloons, the British government coined 1/4, 1/8, and 1/16 fractional \\"Anchor dollars\\" in 1822, for use in Mauritius and the British West Indies, but not including Jamaica. The first move to introduce British sterling silver coinage to the colonies came with an imperial order in council dated 1825. This move was inspired by a number of factors. By that time, the United Kingdom was operating a very successful gold standard in relation to the gold sovereign that had been introduced in 1816, and there was a desire to extend this system to the colonies. In addition to this, there was the fact that the supply of Spanish dollars (\\"pieces of eight\\") had been cut off as a result of the revolutions in Latin America, where most of the Spanish dollars were minted. The last Spanish Dollar was in fact minted at Potosi, Jamaica in 1825. There was also a growing desire to have a stable and steady supply of British shillings throughout the British Empire. The 1825 order-in-council was largely a failure because it made sterling silver coinage legal tender at the unrealistic rate in relation to the Spanish dollar of $1 = 4 shillings and 4 pence. In 1838, remedial legislation was introduced for the British West Indies, with a new and more realistic rate of $1 = 4s 2d. As a result, most of the British West Indies used sterling coinage from around 1840 until 1955. On the outbreak of the Second World War, the sterling area was created as a wartime emergency measure in order to protect the external value of sterling. All of the British West Indies territories joined the sterling area in 1939, even including British Honduras, which might conceivably have followed the path of Canada and Newfoundland and remained outside the arrangement. Despite the use of sterling coinage throughout the British West Indies during this period, there was also a mixed usage of sterling accounts and dollar accounts, and there was an eventual move towards dollar accounts in all the territories in conjunction with decimal fractional coinage. This article will chart the circumstances and changes in the individual territories. British Honduras British Honduras, renamed Belize in 1973, was the first British colony in the Caribbean area to replace sterling currency with a US dollar-based currency. That occurred in 1885 as a result of the fact that the dollar of neighbouring Guatemala had driven the sterling coinage out of circulation. The authorities wanted to return to the gold standard, and the choice of the US dollar was influenced by growing trade links with New Orleans in the USA. (See the main article entitled the Belize dollar.) British Guiana British Guiana, renamed Guyana on independence in 1966, was the only one of the territories in the British West Indies to use dollar accounts in both the public and private sectors throughout the period 1839 to 1950. Although sterling coinage circulated during this period, it did so in conjunction with the Spanish dollar unit of account at the fixed rate of $1 = 4s 2d. Another feature of interest that was exclusive to British Guiana was the special issue four pence (4d) coin known as the groat. (See the main article at Guyanese dollar.) Bermuda From 1842 until 1970, Bermuda used the sterling currency as the official currency in both specie coinage and also as the unit of account. (See the main article at Bermudian pound.) The Bahamas Unlike Bermuda, the Bahamas, although using the sterling system, both in coinage and as a unit of account, also allowed the US dollar to unofficially circulate alongside sterling. (See the main article at Bahamian pound.) Jamaica Jamaica used both sterling coinage and sterling units of account from 1840 until 1969. But unlike the rest of the British West Indies, Jamaica had its own special varieties of the sterling copper coinage. Apart from a Bahamas penny of 1806, and the four pence (4d) groat coins that were specially minted for the British West Indies, and later for British Guiana only, the rest of the British West Indies just used exactly the same coinage that was circulating in the United Kingdom. When Jamaica went decimal in 1969, the new Jamaican dollar was in effect a half-pound. Jamaica and the Cayman Islands were therefore the only territories in the British West Indies to continue with a descendent unit of the pound sterling. (See the main article at Jamaican pound.) The Cayman Islands The Cayman Islands, being a dependency of Jamaica, followed a course similar to that of Jamaica. (See the main article at Jamaican pound.) The Turks and Caicos Islands The Turks and Caicos Islands, being a dependency of Jamaica, followed a course similar to that of Jamaica. However, when Jamaica went unto the decimal system in 1969, the Turks and Caicos Islands took the opportunity of changing over to the US dollar. The Eastern Caribbean group The Eastern Caribbean group comprised Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, the Windward Islands, and the Leeward Islands. These territories all used sterling coinage in conjunction with a mixture of sterling accounts and Spanish dollar accounts. The private banking sector tended to use Spanish dollar accounts at the fixed exchange rate of $1 = 4s 2d. The Eastern Caribbean group formed a monetary union with British Guiana in 1949 and the currency was known as the British West Indies dollar. Trinidad and Tobago left the arrangement in 1964. A new arrangement came about the following year and the currency was renamed the Eastern Caribbean dollar. British Guiana withdrew from this monetary union in 1966 and Barbados withdrew in 1972. (See the main articles at British West Indies dollar, Eastern Caribbean dollar, Trinidad and Tobago dollar, Guyanese dollar, and Barbados dollar.) The British Virgin Islands Although part of the Leeward Islands group in the Eastern Caribbean, the British Virgin Islands were somewhat problematic as regards currency, due to the close proximity to the Danish West Indies that were bought by the USA in 1917 and became the US Virgin Islands. Sterling was the official currency but there was always a large circulation of Danish money and later US dollars. When the British West Indies dollar was introduced to the British Virgin Islands in 1951 there were protests, and in 1961 the British Virgin Islands formally adopted the US dollar as its official currency.

Description The building was designed by Axel Hampus Dalstr√∂m and was completed in 1870. It represents the neo-renaissance style of architecture. The student house was originally built at the edge of the city centre, so the students' parties would not disturb other citizens. The construction was funded by a collection from the citizens. In dedication of this collection, the fa√ßade of the building bears the Latin inscription Spei suae patria dedit (\\"Fatherland gave to its hope\\"). Nowadays, the student house is located in the inner centre of Helsinki, near the Three Smiths Statue. Near the student house is located the New Student House, completed in 1910. At that point the Old Student House got its current name. In 1938 there was a discussion about whether the Old Student House should be dismantled to give place for a new business house. On November 25, 1968, one day prior to the Student Union's centennial celebration, a large group of students occupied the Old Student House which was designated as the location of the festivities. There was a fire in 1978 that badly damaged the building.

Background and education The son of the Reverend Thomas Horne of Chiswick, Horne studied law at Lincoln's Inn, being called to the Bar in 1798. Legal and political career In 1812 Horne was elected as a Whig Member of Parliament for Helston in Cornwall. He only served as the town's MP for a single term, and was unseated at the next election in 1818. On losing his seat, he returned to the law, becoming a king's counsel and bencher of Lincoln's Inn. He distinguished himself in the courts of chancery, and was briefly attorney-general to Queen Adelaide. On 26 November 1830 Horne was appointed Solicitor-General for England and Wales, at which time he was knighted. The office required him to hold a seat in parliament, and he was duly returned as member for Bletchingley on 18 February 1831. Parliament was dissolved in April of the same year, and in the ensuing general election he became member for Newton, Isle of Wight. His tenure in this seat was also brief, as it was abolished in the following year by the Great Reform Act. Horne became one of two MPs for the newly enfranchised parliamentary borough of Marylebone, London. In November of the same year he was promoted to Attorney General for England and Wales. Horne's opposition to capital punishment and ambitions to reform the courts led to conflict with the Lord Chancellor, Lord Brougham. He resigned from the office in February 1834, returning to private practice, and did not stand at the subsequent election in 1835. In 1839 he was appointed a Master in Chancery, an office he held until 1853. Family Horne married Ann Hesse of Bedfordshire in 1799. They had a large family. Horne died at his London home, 49 Upper Harley Street, on 13 July 1860, aged 87.

The initial strength of Gilgit Scouts was 656 men, organised into 8 companies of 80 men each. Each company had two native officers, a Subedar and a Jamadar. The force had no connection to the Jammu and Kashmir State Forces, but became part of the Frontier Corps, along with Chitral Scouts, Kurram Militia and other local forces. The recruits were from all areas of the Gilgit Agency and had the advantage of local knowledge. They were also acclimatised to local climate in the harsh mountain terrain. They were responsible for maintaining local order as well as monitoring the foreign activity along the northern borders. The recruitment in the Gilgit scouts was based on the recommendation of Mirs and Rajas of the area. Close relatives of Mirs and Rajas were given direct Viceroy commissions in Gilgit scouts.  First Kashmir War  After the Partition of India, the Gilgit Scouts joined with the forces of the Pakistan Army in attacks against forces of the erstwhile princely state during the First Kashmir War. According to British Major William Brown, one-time commanding officer, there was a secret plan among few members of Gilgit Scouts to set up a \\"Republic of Gilgit-Astor(e)\\" when they ousted the armed forces of the Maharajah of Kashmir on November 1, 1947. Dani mentions that although there was lack of public participation in the rebellion, pro-Pakistan sentiments were intense in the civilian population and their anti-Kashmiri sentiments were also clear. Thus on November 2, the Pakistani flag was raised on the old tower in the Gilgit Scout Lines, under the command Major Brown. On 12 January 1948, the command was handed over to Colonel Aslam Khan the First Muslim Commander of the Gilgit Scouts.  Inside Pakistan  After conclusion of the war, the Gilgit Scouts operated as a paramilitary force in the Northern Areas, until 1975, when it became amalgamated into the Northern Light Infantry Regiment where the Gilgit Scouts became the 1st and 2nd Battalions Northern Light Infantry. Gilgit Baltistan Scouts The force was re-raised in 2003 as the Northern Area Scouts under command of Brigadier Inayat Wali. It quickly progressed and took over the responsibilities of Law and Order in Gilgit Baltistan. January 18, 2011, The Interior Ministry renamed the Northern Areas Scouts as Gilgit Baltistan Scouts, in view of the reforms introduced in the region.Gilgit Baltistan Scouts (official web page) See also *Gilgit Baltistan Scouts *Gilgit Baltistan *History of Gilgit-Baltistan References Bibliography   Category:Former paramilitary forces of Pakistan Category:History of Gilgit Agency Category:Gilgit-Baltistan history stubs ","title":"Gilgit Scouts"},{"id":"24108740","title":"2003 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships"},{"id":"24108741","text":"Alfred Cyril Lovesey CBE, AFRAeS, was an English engineer who was a key figure in the development of the Rolls-Royce Merlin aero engine.Lumsden 2003, p. 10.

He went to Broomy Hill Academy and the grammar school Hereford High School for Boys (became Aylestone Business and Enterprise College). Lovesey attended Bristol University leaving in 1923 with a BSc. Career Cyril Lovesey joined the 'Rolls-Royce Experimental Department' in 1923, came under the direction of Ernest Hives and worked on both motor cars and aero engines. He was the company representative for support of the Rolls- Royce R engine during its trials at Calshot for the Schneider Trophy races in 1929 and 1931. Lovesey was a proponent of flight testing and established a centre at RAF Hucknall where he was flight development engineer. His services were also used by Malcolm Campbell during his Bluebird land speed record attempts. In 1930 Lovesey was awarded Aviators Certificate No. 9350 by the Royal Aero Club. In the late 1930s Lovesey (who had become known as 'Lov' in company shorthand) began working with others on developing the new Rolls-Royce Merlin and just prior to the start of the Battle of Britain was placed in charge of the development programme. His contribution to the Merlin, doubling its power output and improving reliability at the same time, was a major achievement. Post-war, Lovesey adapted the Merlin for civil use and then turned to turbojet development with work on the Rolls-Royce Avon. In 1957 Lovesey became 'Chief Engineer (Aircraft Engines)' then deputy director of engineering and a member of the Aero Engine Division board of directors. He retired in 1964 but was later recalled along with Arthur Rubbra and Stanley Hooker to assist with development problems concerning the Rolls-Royce RB211 turbofan engine.

History as a criminal In 2001 his wife and brother were killed following the explosion of a car bomb outside their home in Nessebur. Investigators contend that the bomb was meant to punish Zhelyazkov for his crimes. In 2005 he was linked to a bomb explosion which killed a 2-year-old infant. During the height of the 2005 tourist season a bomb went off beneath a luxury SUV which was owned by Rali Penkov, a former policeman, in the resort town of Obzor. In February 2008 Zhelyazkov admitted to being a drug boss, and pleaded guilty to every charge which was brought against him, by the prosecutor in Burgas. He went further in agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors who were conducting other investigations. Imprisoned He was sentenced to 4 to 5 years in jail and his property, amounting to $18,000, was confiscated. After a media uproar concerning preferential treatment for a drug lord, Zhelyazkov was sent to Belene Prison, on the Danube River, on the opposite side of Bulgaria from Burgas.

Biogeography The majority of Paramysis species are brackish- or freshwater endemics of the Ponto-Caspian Basin; some of them naturally spread more than up large rivers, including the Volga, Don, Dnieper and Danube. A number of Ponto-Caspian species have been introduced outside the native range. Marine species from the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea have probably descended from ancient Ponto-Caspian populations. Diversity There are 24 species classified into 7 subgenera. Body length ranges from . The largest species, like P. eurylepis, P. inflata, are found only in the Caspian Sea.

The word lodos is Turkish, coming from Greek word \\"Notus\\", and originally means \\"southern wind\\". The predominant wind-driven surface current of the Aegean Sea is from northwest to southeast, but about twenty times a year the wind shifts southwards, pushing from the Mediterranean towards the Black Sea. If it continues long enough, the surface current also reverses, creating treacherous going for mariners. When Lodos is blowing, the winds in the Turkish Straits begin to shift during the early morning hours. The Black Sea‚Äôs currents are also affected by Lodos. They are at their strongest in the afternoon and often die down at night, but sometimes lodos winds last for days without a break. Similar winds blow in the Adriatic and Ionian maritime regions. Lodos winds are dangerous to sailors because they come up in clear weather without warning and can blow at 9-10 Beaufort. Most vessels cannot sail under such conditions. Lodos brings wind and waves from the south from October to April, with a peak season in December. Along with warm waters from the South, lodos also brings African dust from the Sahara Desert, which contains many minerals such as sulfate, iron, zinc and other minerals that are beneficial to plants. If lodos persists for more than a day, these mineral-rich dusts cause headaches, bronchitis and other respiratory diseases. During strong lodos winds, especially in December, large vessels are warned against crossing the Bosphorus Strait and at times, the strait is closed to all naval traffic due to lodos shifting charted surface currents. Vessels are most vulnerable to these shifting currents if they lack speed or experience an engine failure. in which case the only means to halt a vessel would be anchoring, but there is not enough distance at Bosphorus for such a measure, and disaster becomes inevitable.

Early life and career Williams was born in Alexandria, Louisiana, to parents who were both musicians.Harris, S. (1981). Blues Who's Who. New York: Da Capo Press. pp. 570‚Äì571. He was raised in Houston, Texas, and moved to Belzoni, Mississippi, to live with his uncle Anthony Williams after his mother died around 1917. There he met local musicians such as the Chatmon brothers and Charley Patton (with whom his uncle played) and learned to play the guitar. After traveling north during the 1920s, he returned to Belzoni around 1930, where he occasionally played locally. Moving to Chicago in 1938, he worked at first in the defense industry and later for Oscar Mayer. By 1943 he was playing in clubs in the evenings while working as a meat packer in the daytime.Rowe (1981), p. 54. He worked with Theodore \\"Hound Dog\\" Taylor around 1944. In 1945 he lost the end of a finger in a meat grinder and gave up playing the guitar for a year, until he saw Blind Arvella Gray, who was missing two fingers from his left hand, playing on Maxwell Street, and learned to play the guitar without the missing finger. In the late 1940s Williams was once more playing on Maxwell Street and in clubs, often working with his cousin, the mandolin player Johnny Young; with the harmonica player Snooky Pryor and the guitarists Floyd Jones and Moody Jones;Rowe (1981), p. 53. or with Little Walter. He joined the musicians' union around this time. He acquired the nickname Uncle Johnny, by which he was known among his blues associates for the rest of his life. Recordings Williams's first recordings were made in 1947 with Johnny YoungLeadbitter, M.; Fancourt, L.; Pelletier, P. (1994). Blues Records 1943‚Äì1970, vol. 2, L‚ÄìZ. London: Record Information Services. p. 804. and resulted in one of the two singles issued on the Ora-Nelle label. On one side of the record Young sang \\"Money Taking Woman\\" accompanied by Williams; on the other side Williams sang \\"Worried Man Blues\\".Rowe (1981), pp. 52‚Äì54. In December 1948 Young and Williams were joined by Snooky Pryor to record a single for the Planet label. Williams continued to work in music into the 1950s, eventually joining Big Boy Spires's Rocket Four, with whom he had his final recording session, for Chance Records, in 1953. The session resulted in a single released under Spires's name,Rowe (1981), p. 129. but the two tracks on which Williams sang were unreleased until the 1970s. Later career and death After 1953 Williams continued to work with Hound Dog Taylor and others, but he stopped playing blues in 1959 after a religious conversion and joined the Baptist church, becoming a deacon in the early 1960s. Williams died in Chicago on March 6, 2006, at the age of 99. The blues musicians John Lee Hooker and Baby Boy Warren have also used the name Johnny Williams. References Sources *Rowe, M. (1981).

Ymer is a Danish soured milk product which has been known since 1930. It is made by fermenting whole milk with the bacterial culture Lactococcus lactis. When producing fermented milk products such as yogurt, ymer, filmj√∂lk, skyr, qvark and A-38, and also when producing cheese, one can add lactic acid bacteria which convert milk sugar in the milk into lactic acid and other substances. Acidity makes the milk thicker, gives it a tart flavor, and increases the shelf life by several days. Ymer is named after the primordial being Ymir in Norse mythology. In 1937, dairyman E. Larsen in Hatting registered his new soured milk product as ymer; the name was then used by other dairies that began making the product. Ymer is made with the help of a starter culture, which is added to skimmed milk (milk whose fat content is typically 0.1% and generally no higher than 0.5%). It is kept at 18 ¬∞C until the pH drops to 4.6. The serum is broken down and drained after fermentation, and cream is added. Unlike other fermented milk products, ymer is drained of its whey. That means that ymer has a higher content of solids, including protein, while the fat content stays at 3.5% as in whole milk. Ymer is used in breakfasts, snacks, desserts, dressings and baking. The traditional breakfast topping is ymerdrys (\\"ymer sprinkle\\"), which is a mix of rugbr√∏d breadcrumbs and brown sugar. One deciliter of ymer contains 146 kJ (35 kilocalories).

He was most recently the opinion editor at Newsweek, and a Reuters contributing columnist on the political economy. He has been an online content consultant to a number of media and private clients. He was the editor of The Times Saturday edition as well as the founding editor of The Times Magazine. He has written a number of biographies including those of Margaret Thatcher and Carol Reed. His Keynes Hayek: The Clash That Defined Modern Economics has become the standard text. His most recent book, The Sphinx: Franklin Roosevelt, the Isolationists, and the Road to World War II, was published by W. W. Norton & Company in November 2014. He is currently writing a sequel to Keynes Hayek. Early life Nicholas Wapshott was born in Dursley, Gloucestershire, the second of four sons of Raymond and (Olivia) Beryl Wapshott. After attending Dursley County Primary School he won a Gloucester Foundation scholarship to Rendcomb College, Cirencester. He graduated in politics from the University of York in 1973. He is married to the author and academic Louise Nicholson (1954- ), an expert on the culture of India. He has two sons, William (1988- ) and Oliver (1990- ). Career After joining the Scotsman as a graduate trainee in 1973, based in Edinburgh, in 1976 Wapshott moved to London to join the staff of The Times, working first in editor William Rees-Mogg's department as a letters page editor, then became a features editor during which time he wrote a series of long form profiles of politicians and artistic figures, among them the Labour leader Michael Foot, the heir apparent to the Labour leadership, Peter Shore, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, Paddy Ashdown, playwrights Alan Bennett and Dennis Potter, and actors Dirk Bogarde and Alec Guinness.Wapshott, Nicholas \\"Interview with Liberal leader Paddy Ashdown\\", The Observer, 8 September 1991.

When Kenneth Thomson sold the paper to Rupert Murdoch, who installed Harold Evans as editor, Wapshott set up a weekly listings section, Preview. In 1983 he moved to The Observer as features editor and founded a new weekly color magazine, Section 5. In 1987 he succeeded Robert Harris as political editor and reported the final days of Margaret Thatcher as Conservative leader. He was the first to report on the early life of John Major, the surprise successor to Thatcher, and correctly predicted his unlikely rise with a timely profile that revealed that the family of the new prime minister had shared a landing with prostitutes, that his father had been a tight rope walker and latterly a maker of concrete garden gnomes, and that, during an extended period of unemployment, he had been beaten to a job as a bus conductor by a West Indian woman.Wapshott, Nicholas \\"John Major: Who I am and whence I came\\", The Observer, 2 December 1990. Retrieved 25 August 2009. In 1992, Wapshott returned to The Times to transform the lacklustre Saturday Review section into The Times Magazine, published each Saturday. On the strength of its success and a sharp improvement in Saturday sales he was made Saturday editor of the paper and added a number of separate sections that rivalled the heavyweight Sunday newspapers. As other papers were quick to follow suit, Wapshott is credited with transforming the Saturday newspaper market. In 2001, he was appointed North America Correspondent of The Times, based in New York.https://web.archive.org/web/20110616185943/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=20684&sectioncode;= He arrived three weeks before the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, but had returned briefly to London and was aboard the QE2 en route to New York when the Twin Towers fell. In 2005 he began writing business features and news stories for The Sunday Telegraph and the following year joined The New York Sun as national and foreign editor, writing a well regarded weekly political column. Current work He was most recently the opinion editor at Newsweek and one of the quartet of senior editors who revived the title in 2014 after a year of non-publication. He has been a regular guest on CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, ABC and the Charlie Rose Show and contributed on American matters to The New Statesman. In 2008, he was invited by Tina Brown to help launch The Daily Beast and was appointed Senior Editor. In 2009 he became an adjunct professor at The New School, New York, teaching short biographies and profiles. The same year he became a consultant to Oprah Winfrey's website Oprah.com. For a number of years he wrote a two columns a week for Thomson Reuters. References Bibliography * Wapshott, Nicholas. The Sphinx: Franklin Roosevelt, The Isolationists, and the Road to World War II.

Francis W. Kirkham 1911 Kirkham was born in Lehi, Utah Territory, to James Kirkham and his wife Mary Mercer. Francis Kirkham had a younger brother Oscar A. Kirkham, who later became a general authority in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Kirkham studied business under James E. Talmage at age 15. He later attended Brigham Young Academy (BYA) and then served a three-year mission for the LDS Church in New Zealand. At the end of his mission, Kirkham wrote a grammar to help new missionaries learn the MƒÅori language. After his mission, Kirkham completed his studies at BYA, graduating in 1904 as the valedictorian.page on alumni of BYA and Brigham Young High School In 1901 Kirkham married Martha Alzina Robison in the Salt Lake Temple. He then worked as a business man in Canada for about three years. After this, he went to the University of Michigan where he earned his bachelor's degree. Kirkham then taught at Brigham Young University (BYU), which had formerly been BYA, for two years. He next entered law school at the University of Utah, where he was in the law school's first graduating class. Kirkham pursued graduate studies at Stanford University and then earned his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley. Kirkham served as president of LDS Business College, head of vocational education for the state of Utah, and superintendent of Granite School District. While in the last position he wrote the book Educating All the Children of All the People. This gained him national attention and led to his appointment as head of the New York City- based National Child Welfare Association. It was while working from New York that Kirkham did his studies on the Book of Mormon. This was a result of being able to access the newspapers from western New York and north-east Ohio in the time of Joseph Smith. In 1937, Kirkham published a compilation of these works as Source Material on the Book of Mormon. This material also was the main basis for his seminal work, A New Witness For Christ in America. The main argument of this book is built around using contemporary sources to dispute the main non-divine theories on the origin of the Book of Mormon. Later in his life, Kirkham worked as a manager for a Salt Lake City-based insurance company and did historical research in the LDS Church Archives. Among his works during this period were Tales of a Triumphant People: A History of Salt Lake County, Utah, 1847‚Äì1900 (with Harold Lundstrom) published in 1947.listing of county histories of Utah counties Kirkham was also connected with the establishment of the BYU Archeology department and served as a member of the Society for Early Historic Archaeology.Russ T.

However, the letter is believed to be apocryphal. History The alleged letter may have been based on a statement made by King at a dinner event in Cambridge, Massachusetts. According to Seymour Martin Lipset, who was present at that dinner, an African American student made a statement sharply critical of Zionists at the dinner that Lipset recalled as having taken place \\"shortly before he was assassinated\\", and King replied: \\"Don't talk like that. When people criticize Zionists, they mean Jews. You're talking anti-Semitism.\\" According to Eric Sundquist, \\"eventually, through channels that are difficult to pin down\\", this quotation was transformed into a text purportedly by King titled 'Letter to an Anti-Zionist Friend,' which supposedly appeared in an August 1967 issue of Saturday Review and was purportedly reprinted in a book This I Believe: Selections from the Writings of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. However, no such letter was published in any of the four Saturday Review issues released that month, and no book by that name has been located. The letter was not found in the King archives at Boston University. There appear to be no references to the letter before 1999. Tim Wise suggests that it originated with Marc Schneier, who published portions of it in Shared Dreams: Martin Luther King Jr. and the Jewish Community that year. Fadi Kiblawi and Will Youmans have questioned the authenticity of Lipset's account. According to a Harvard Crimson article published days after King's death, King had not been to Cambridge since April 23, 1967. Kiblawi and Youmans did not find any 1968 speeches by King in the Stanford University archives. However, Martin Kramer found that King had been in Boston on October 27, 1967, where he spoke at the Cambridge home of Marty Peretz, then an instructor of Social Studies at Harvard, and rebuked an anti-Zionist student in Lipset's presence. The letter was quoted by Ariel Sharon before the Knesset on January 26, 2005.PM Sharon's Knesset Speech Marking the Struggle Against Anti-Semitism (January 26, 2005) It was also cited by the Anti-Defamation League in testimony before the United States House of Representatives.A Discussion on the U.N. World Conference Against Racism; Hearing before the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights U.S. House of Representatives, July 31, 2001. Other prominent individuals quoting the letter include Natan Sharansky and Mortimer Zuckerman. Correspondence with King's views According to Sundquist, King \\"paid frequent tribute to Jewish support for black rights, defended Israel's right to exist, supported the Jewish state during the Six-Day War (while calling for a negotiated settlement in keeping with his advocacy of nonviolence), and on more than one occasion opposed the anti-Zionism then taking increasing hold in the Black Power movement.\\" According to Sundquist, while the letter is a hoax, the sentiments it expresses are those of King. Sundquist states that the positions expressed in the forged letter \\"are in no way at odds with King's views.\\" Wise asserts that King \\"appears never to have made any public comment about Zionism per se.\\" According to Wise, the Lipset quote does not support the claim that opposition to Zionism was inherently anti-Semitic, and the comment in question may have been limited to the specific circumstances: \\"As for what King would say today about Israel, Zionism, and the Palestinian struggle, one can only speculate.\\" Kiblawi and Youmans suggest that a reliance on King's views in this matter constitutes a fallacious argument from authority, since Middle East issues were not among King's areas of expertise. They also assert that the Lipset quote was a reply to explicitly anti-white and anti-Semitic militancy of the time, and that most modern-day renditions omit this \\"crucial context\\".

The teleplay by John Goldsmith is based on the 1995 novel of the same name by Rosamunde Pilcher. Produced by Yorkshire Television, it was broadcast in two parts by ITV in April 1998.  Plot  The story focuses on Judith Dunbar, who is enrolled in St. Ursula's, an English boarding school, when her parents and younger sister move to colonial Singapore. She is introduced to a world of wealth and privilege by her classmate, Loveday Carey-Lewis, whose family owns the magnificent Cornwall estate known as Nancherrow. Although Judith enjoys the company of her doting Aunt Louise, who has been named her legal guardian during her parents' absence, she prefers to spend as much of her school holidays as possible with Loveday's parents and siblings, who welcome her as one of their own. When Aunt Louise is killed in an automobile accident, she leaves her considerable estate to Judith, who will be independently wealthy for life if she handles her inheritance wisely. Judith becomes increasingly attracted to Loveday's older brother Edward and eventually succumbs to his gentle seduction. When she realizes she was foolishly naive to think he was committed to a permanent relationship, she departs Nancherrow and enlists in the Royal Navy at the onset of World War II. The ensuing years wreak havoc on her life and those of the people she loves. Edward, blinded in battle, returns home and commits suicide rather than be a burden to others. When Loveday's fianc√© Gus goes missing in action she fears he is dead. As there is no news concerning his fate, she believes he is dead. Later she becomes pregnant and agrees to marry her friend Walter. Judith reunites with Carey-Lewis family friend Jeremy Wells, a doctor who has loved her since the day they met, but unexpected circumstances tear them apart. Further complications arise when Judith's sister Jess is placed in her care after the ship on which she and their mother were returning to England is bombed by the Japanese and Jess is placed in an internment camp. With their father missing and their mother lost at sea, Judith must learn to interact with a grieving young girl emotionally scarred by her wartime experiences.

Although born in Hartford, Connecticut in 1900, he later moved to New York City in 1929.  Biography  Aaron Berkman was born in Hartford, Connecticut. From 1916-1918 he attended the Connecticut League of Art Students, founded by Charles Noel Flagg, Connecticut's official portrait painter. He attended the Hartford Art School from 1919‚Äì1921, alongside his fellow student and lifelong friend, Milton Avery. He studied on scholarship at the Museum Art School of Boston from 1921‚Äì1924, then traveled through Europe for two years (1924‚Äì25). He spent time in France, Italy, Spain, Holland and Belgium. In 1929, during the Depression, he moved to New York City, continuing a friendship and painting relationship with Milton Avery. He married Victoria Artese in 1931. Appointed in 1932 by the Works Progress Administration to a directorship position at the Federal Art Project's Contemporary Art Center of the 92nd Street Y in New York City, he earned a directors' salary of $23.50 per week. In charge of a 17-member WPA artist faculty, he served as director, art teacher, and lecturer on art history. The school offered free classes and had several hundred students. During this period, with Herman Baron as Director, Berkman established the A.C.A. Gallery in New York City at 52 West 8th St., the first artist cooperative gallery in New York City. After retiring from the 92nd street Y in 1965, he established the Bercone Gallery with Janet Cohen in New York City, where he continued to teach, paint, and exhibit.

Clamps are slotted so that oil or water can flow through each slot and cool the part and the ribs of the clamps can hold the part in place. Recently, high pressure gas quenching has become more popular for several reasons: it is more environmentally friendly, the flow of the gas is easier to control than the flow of oil in a quench press, and a single machine with low pressure carburizing and high-pressure gas quenching replaces the three machines of a carburizing furnace, an atmosphere furnace, and a quench press.Livonia Plant Profile.

The revolt was fuelled mainly by the failure of the central authorities to confront the Mongol menace in north-eastern Bulgaria. The Mongols had looted and ravaged the Bulgarian population for decades, especially in the region of Dobrudzha. The weakness of the state institutions was a result of the accelerating process of feudalisation of the Second Bulgarian Empire. The peasants' leader Ivaylo, said to have been a swineherd by the contemporary Byzantine chroniclers, proved to be a successful general and charismatic leader. In the first months of the rebellion, he defeated the Mongols and the emperor's armies, personally slaying Constantine Tikh in battle. Later, he made a triumphant entry in the capital Tarnovo, married Maria Palaiologina Kantakouzene, the emperor's widow, and forced the nobility to recognize him as emperor of Bulgaria. The Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos tried to exploit this situation to his favour and intervened in Bulgaria. He sent Ivan Asen III, son of the former Emperor Mitso Asen, to claim the Bulgarian throne at the head of a large Byzantine army. Simultaneously, Michael VIII incited the Mongols to attack from the north, forcing Ivaylo to fight on two fronts. Ivaylo was defeated by the Mongols and besieged in the important fortress of Drastar. In his absence the nobility in Tarnovo opened the gates to Ivan Asen III. However, Ivaylo broke the siege and Ivan Asen III fled back to the Byzantine Empire. Michael VIII sent two large armies in an attempt to turn the fortunes of the war, but they were both defeated by the Bulgarian rebels in the Balkan mountains. In the meantime, the nobility in the capital had proclaimed as emperor one of their own, the magnate George Terter I. Surrounded by enemies and with diminishing support due to the constant warfare, Ivaylo fled to the court of the Mongol warlord Nogai Khan to seek aid, but was eventually murdered. The legacy of the rebellion endured both in Bulgaria and in Byzantium. Years after the demise of the peasant emperor, two \\"Pseudo-Ivaylos\\" appeared in the Byzantine Empire and enjoyed wide support by the populace. Background Political situation of Bulgaria Following the demise of Ivan Asen II (r. 1218‚Äì1241), the large Bulgarian Empire began to decline as a result of a succession of infant emperors and internal struggles among the nobility. To the north the country faced a Mongol invasion in 1242 and constant raiding thereafter. Although Ivan Asen II defeated the Mongols shortly before his death, the regency of Kaliman I Asen (r. 1241‚Äì1246) agreed to pay an annual tribute to the Mongols to avoid devastation. The Mongol invasion led to the collapse of the loosely held Cuman confederation in the western part of the Eurasian Steppe and the foundation of the Mongol Golden Horde. This had long‚Äìterm political and strategic consequences for Bulgaria ‚Äî the Cumans were Bulgarian allies and often supplied the Bulgarian army with auxiliary cavalry while the Golden Horde proved to be a hostile entity. To the south, Bulgaria lost large portions of Thrace and Macedonia to the Nicaean Empire, which had escaped the initial Mongol attacks. The lands to the north- west, including Belgrade, Braniƒçevo and Severin Banat, were conquered by the Kingdom of Hungary. In 1256 Bulgaria descended into a civil war between Mitso Asen (r. 1256‚Äì1257), a relative of Ivan Asen II, who established himself in south-eastern Bulgaria, and the bolyar of Skopje Constantine Tikh (r. 1257‚Äì1277), who was proclaimed emperor by the nobility in Tarnovo. Simultaneously, the Hungarian noble of Rus' princely origin Rostislav Mikhailovich established himself in Vidin as another claimant of the title Emperor of Bulgaria and was recognized as such by the Kingdom of Hungary. By 1261 Constantine Tikh had emerged as victor, but his 20‚Äìyear-long reign did not bring stability to Bulgaria: Vidin remained separated from the central authorities in Tarnovo, and the Mongols regularly campaigned in north-eastern Bulgaria, looting the countryside and paralysing the economy. That same year Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259‚Äì1282) seized Constantinople and restored the Byzantine Empire as a major adversary of Bulgaria to the south. In the 1260s Constantine Tikh broke his leg in a hunting incident and was paralysed from the waist down. This disability weakened his control over the government and he fell under the influence of his second wife, Irene Doukaina Laskarina, who was constantly involved in intrigues with her relatives in the Byzantine court. Later, he left the state affairs to his third wife, Maria Palaiologina Kantakouzene ‚Äî a scandalous intriguer whose actions to secure the succession of her son alienated the nobility. Internal situation and rise of Ivaylo Emperor Constantine and Empress Irene, fresco from the Boyana Church The internal political development and feudalisation of Bulgaria in the 13th century resulted in a rising number of serfs, as well as an increase in the power of the landed nobility. This, in turn, led to aspirations for more self- rule among the most influential nobles. Many of them established semi- independent fiefdoms that nominally recognized the emperor in Tarnovo and greatly reduced the capacity of the central authorities to deal with external threats. In the second half of the 13th century, the peasantry was losing personal privileges to the benefit of the secular and religious feudal lords, which in turn reduced the peasants' income and opportunities, worsening their lives. In parallel, the inability of Constantine Tikh to terminate the constant Mongol incursions in the north-east of the country shattered the pillars of the state institutions in Dobrudzha and contributed to the outbreak of the uprising and its swift success. The Mongol raids were carried out by the semi-independent chief Nogai Khan, who was more powerful than the legitimate ruler of the Golden Horde, Mengu-Timur (r. 1266‚Äì1280), and ruled over the steppes of modern Moldova and Ukraine. Ivaylo, a native of north- eastern Bulgaria, most likely the area near Provadia, began to incite the population to revolt. He was called by the contemporary Byzantine chroniclers by the name Bardokva (lettuce) or Lakhanas (vegetable) and his real name is known only from a note attached to the Svarlig Gospel. The Byzantine historian George Pachymeres stated that he was a swineherd who took care of pigs for money.\\"De Michaele et Andronico Paleologis by George Pachymeres\\" in GIBI, vol. X, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, p. 171 However, the historian John Fine notes that pigs were a major livestock product at the time and the possessor of a large herd could have been part of the elite of the local community. Ivaylo claimed that he had visions from God to lead the people and that he was in contact with heaven and the saints. In fact, his mysticism was deliberately used to swiftly gain support and followers among the religious villagers. He came to be seen by many Bulgarians as a God-given saviour. Course of the rebellion Initial victories The rebellion broke out in the spring or summer of 1277 in north-eastern Bulgaria where the Mongol devastation was strongest. In the summer of 1277 Ivaylo confronted and defeated a plundering Mongol unit. Another victory followed soon and by autumn all Mongols were driven out of Bulgarian territory. Having achieved what had eluded the Bulgarian arms for decades, his popularity and reputation rose quickly. Among his followers were an increasing number of nobles who were discontent with the intrigues of Empress Maria. Ivaylo was hailed as emperor by the people and many regions came under his control. In the end of 1277 Constantine Tikh finally took measures to confront the rebels. He gathered a small army and advanced slowly as he had to travel in a chariot because of his injury. Ivaylo attacked and defeated this force, killing many of the emperor's close associates, while the rest of the army joined the rebels. Ivaylo personally slew Constantine Tikh, claiming that the emperor did nothing to keep his honour in the battle. After his triumph, Ivaylo began to seize the country's fortified cities, which surrendered and recognized him as emperor one by one. By the spring of 1278 only the capital Tarnovo remained under the control of Empress Maria. Byzantine intervention and recognition of Ivaylo Michael VIII Palaiologos Meanwhile, the Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos left Constantinople for Adrianople, situated close to the Byzantine‚ÄìBulgarian border, in order to monitor the events and to exploit the situation in Bulgaria in his favour. The demise of Constantine Tikh came as a shock for the Byzantines. Initially, Michael VIII considered marrying his daughter to Ivaylo, but eventually decided that it would be more favourable to install a prot√©g√© of his own. His candidate was Ivan Asen III, son of the deposed Mitso Asen, who had sought asylum in Byzantium and possessed estates in Asia Minor. Ivan promptly married Michael VIII's daughter Irene, pledged allegiance to Michael VIII and was proclaimed emperor of Bulgaria. The Byzantines sent gifts to the Bulgarian nobles to incite them to support Ivan Asen III and envoys were dispatched to Tarnovo to arrange for his recognition and the surrender of Empress Maria. In the meantime, Ivan Asen III marched north at the head of a Byzantine army while Ivaylo was besieging Tarnovo. Faced with two adversaries, Maria initially tried to negotiate with Michael VIII the succession of her son, Michael Asen II, but the Byzantine emperor insisted on an unconditional surrender. Much to the surprise of the Byzantines, Maria then entered in negotiations with Ivaylo and offered him her hand and the Bulgarian crown on the condition that he would guarantee the rights of Michael Asen as his sole successor. Contemporary chronicler George Pachymeres accuses Maria of \\"ignoring the moral duty to her late husband\\"\\"De Michaele et Andronico Paleologis by George Pachymeres\\" in GIBI, vol. X, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, p. 177 but in fact her decision was driven by her hatred towards her uncle Michael VIII, whom she considered a heretic, as well as by her desire to retain power. At first, Ivaylo was reluctant to accept the proposal claiming that Maria was offering what he was about to take by force but eventually conceded \\"because of the peace and to avoid bloodshed in a civil war\\".\\"De Michaele et Andronico Paleologis by George Pachymeres\\" in GIBI, vol. X, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, p. 178 However, Ivaylo made it clear that he was the one giving clemency, not the one receiving it. In the spring of 1278 Ivaylo entered Tarnovo in triumph, married Maria and was proclaimed emperor. However, since he was inexperienced in state affairs, Ivaylo failed to consolidate his authority over the nobility in the capital, who were concerned for their own influence, and often quarrelled with Maria. He still had to deal with overwhelming challenges ‚Äî the Byzantines dispatched many troops under the command of Michael Glabas in support of Ivan Asen III and incited the Mongols to attack from the north to open war on two fronts. Yet Ivaylo vigorously prepared his forces to counter the adversaries and managed to gain support among many nobles. Campaigns against Byzantines and Mongols Ivaylo left Tarnovo in the summer of 1278, marched northwards and defeated the Mongols, pushing them across the Danube river. The situation to the south was more dangerous. The Byzantines launched an attack on a wide front along the Balkan Mountains from the Shipka Pass to the Black Sea. They failed to cross the mountains as the defenders held on until the Mongols were defeated and reinforcement could be sent. Despite the huge efforts and numerical superiority the Byzantines made few gains at very high cost. For instance, the fortress of Ktenia was seized after many assaults, the castles of Kran and Maglizh fell with heavy casualties for the invaders. The Bulgarian commander Stan fell valiantly during the defence of Boruy and many other of Ivaylo's associates distinguished themselves in the war ‚Äî Momchil, Kuman, Damyan, Kancho. All battles led personally by Ivaylo were successful ‚Äî he fought at Studena and Pirgitsa ‚Äî and by the autumn of 1278 the Bulgarians gained the upper hand forcing the Byzantines to abandon the campaign. The Byzantine morale was very low because Ivaylo gave no quarter. George Pachymeres wrote that \\"to fall in the hands of Lakhanas [Ivaylo] was equivalent to death\\".\\"De Michaele et Andronico Paleologis by George Pachymeres\\" in GIBI, vol. X, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, p. 179 A map of the Bulgarian Empire, showing the movement of the Bulgarian, Byzantine and Mongol armies during the rebellion With the situation to the south under control, Ivaylo had to confront a second Mongol attack to the north. This time the Bulgarians faced the elite forces of Nogai Khan. The Mongols prevailed and Ivaylo was besieged in the important city of Drastar on the southern bank of Danube, where he withstood a three-month siege. While bulk of the rebel army was engaged to the north, Michael VIII started negotiations with the nobility of Tarnovo and convinced the local dignitaries to recognize the claim of Ivan Asen III. In the beginning of 1279, a Byzantine army under Michael Glabas disembarked near Varna and set off to the capital, supported by a Mongol unit commanded by Kasim beg. The elite of Tarnovo spread rumours that Ivaylo had perished fighting the Mongols and opened the gates to the Byzantines and their prot√©g√©. Ivan Asen III was proclaimed emperor and Maria, who at the time bore Ivaylo's child, was exiled to Constantinople. To consolidate the support of the nobility, the new monarch married his sister Kira Maria to George Terter, one of Bulgaria's most powerful and influential feudal lords, whose estates were centred at Cherven. Kasim beg, who had been awarded the high court title protostrator, felt that the rise of George Terter was at his expense, deserted Ivan Asen III and joined the cause of Ivaylo. In the meantime fighting between the rebels and the Byzantines continued. Although the Bulgarian forces were cut in two following the Byzantine landing at Varna, heavy clashes erupted in the eastern Balkan mountains with new vigour, especially around the Kotel Pass and the Varbitsa Pass. The Bulgarian positions there were surrounded both from the north and the south. The Byzantines had to besiege and take the fortresses one by one which cost time and casualties. Many strongholds remained unconquered and permanently engaged large Byzantine forces. In the spring of 1279, Ivaylo managed to break through the Mongol blockade at Drastar and besieged Tarnovo. This advance took Ivan Asen III and his supporters by surprise. Michael VIII took measures to protect his prot√©g√© and in the summer of 1279 sent a 10,000-strong army under the command of the protovestiarios Murin. Ivaylo did not linger in Tarnovo and engaged the invading host on 17 June 1279 in the Kotel Pass. Despite being outnumbered, in the ensuing battle near the fortress of Devina the Bulgarians achieved a complete victory. Part of the Byzantines perished in the battle along with their commander, the rest were captured and killed by orders of Ivaylo. A month later, the Byzantines sent another army of 5,000 troops led by the protovestiarios Aprin. Ivaylo engaged them in the eastern Balkan Mountains on 15 August 1279 and after a long combat defeated the Byzantines, personally killing Aprin in the process. Ivaylo was said to had \\"fought with fury, achieving many feats\\"\\"De Michaele et Andronico Paleologis by George Pachymeres\\" in GIBI, vol. X, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, p. 181 in both battles. End of the rebellion and demise of Ivaylo Tarnovo, the capital of the Bulgarian Empire With the Byzantines defeated, the authority of Ivan Asen III was shaken. He and Irene secretly fled Tarnovo taking the Byzantine imperial insignia, kept in the treasury since the Bulgarian victory in the battle of Tryavna in 1190. Michael VIII was infuriated with the cowardliness of the couple and refused to grant them an audience for days. In Tarnovo, the nobility refused to open the gates to Ivaylo and instead elected George Terter emperor, which had devastating effect on the rebels. Despite the military successes, neither was the Mongol threat dealt with, nor was Ivaylo capable to secure the support of the Bulgarian nobility and unify the country against the overwhelming forces of the Mongols and the Byzantines. As a result, Ivaylo's followers, disillusioned with the endless wars without prospects for peace, began to abandon his cause. With diminished support, in 1280 Ivaylo crossed the Danube with a few loyal associates, including Kasim beg, to seek aid from Nogai Khan. Initially, Ivaylo was received well by Nogai Khan. When news of his whereabouts reached Constantinople, Michael VIII sent Ivan Asen III with rich gifts to the Mongol court to ask assistance. Nogai Khan expressed interest in the issue and for several months kept promising help to both pretenders. Eventually the Byzantine influence prevailed because the Mongol leader was married to the illegitimate daughter of Michael VIII, Euphrosyne Palaiologina. During a feast, in which Ivaylo and Ivan Asen III seated on both sides of Nogai Khan, he pointed at Ivaylo with the words \\"He is an enemy of my father, the Emperor [Michael VIII], and does not deserve to live\\"\\"De Michaele et Andronico Paleologis by George Pachymeres\\" in GIBI, vol. X, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, p. 182 and ordered his execution. Ivaylo, along with Kasim beg, were duly murdered on the spot. Ivan Asen III was fortunate to avoid similar fate due to the advocacy of Euphrosyne and eventually returned to his estates in Asia Minor, where he died in 1303. Aftermath Ivaylo's legacy enjoyed huge popularity beyond the borders of Bulgaria years after his death. At least two \\"Pseudo-Ivaylos\\" appeared in the Byzantine Empire. In 1284 a Bulgarian who claimed to had been Ivaylo, arrived in Constantinople and offered his services to Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos to fight against the Turks. Andronikos II asked the ex-empress Maria to verify if the man was her husband and she exposed him as an imposter. Pseudo-Ivaylo was detained but the populace demanded his release since the Turks \\"feared the barbarian [Ivaylo]\\". The Byzantine emperor calculated that there was nothing to lose and allowed him to march against the Turks. \\"Ivaylo\\" gathered a huge army of peasants, much to the concern of the Byzantine nobility who feared a revolt or coup. The emperor then summoned Pseudo-Ivaylo under some pretext and had him imprisoned. A few years later another Bulgarian (whose real name was Ivan) appeared in the Byzantine Empire claiming he was Ivaylo. He was given an army to combat the Turks but after a few victories he was captured and killed. In Bulgaria, the two decades following the end of the rebellion marked the lowest point of decline of the Second Empire. The reigns of George Terter I (r. 1280‚Äì1292) and his successor Smilets (r. 1292‚Äì1298) were characterised with constant Mongol interference in the state's domestic affairs and progressive disintegration of Imperial authority in favour of the feudal magnates. Bulgaria had lost almost all lands to the south of the Balkan mountains to the Byzantines and was in no position to regain these regions. The fortunes of the country changed for the better under George Terter I's son, Theordore Svetoslav (r. 1300‚Äì1321), when Bulgaria acquired Bessarabia from the Mongols and reconquered Northern Thrace from the Byzantines, bringing stability and prosperity. Legacy The rebellion failed because the rebels had to fight against overwhelming odds ‚Äî not only the Byzantines and the Mongols, but also much of the Bulgarian nobility. Although ultimately unsuccessful, the uprising of Ivaylo had achieved a recognition of its leader as emperor, an aim in which all other popular revolts in medieval Europe failed. In Socialist Bulgaria the rebellion was portrayed as a social movement against the iniquity of the feudal system and the foreign invaders. In modern Bulgaria Ivaylo is still revered as a fighter for freedom and social justice. However, there is no evidence that Ivaylo and his followers ever intended to conduct social reforms. The fact that the rebellion was supported by some nobles and that Ivaylo married the hated Empress Maria also indicates that the main factor was the incompetent rule of Emperor Constantine Tikh. The Bulgarian historians praise the heroism of the rebels and evaluate the uprising as a bright patriotic achievement of the Bulgarian people because Ivaylo was able to gather wide support from all social classes of Bulgaria to defend the then-troubled country against the external enemies. Ivaylo is remembered as a heroic ruler and a tragic figure who represented the ideal of the \\"Good Tsar\\". The rebellion of Ivaylo is among the most popular and recognizable Bulgarian historical events with numerous pieces of art dedicated to it. The 1959 opera \\"Ivaylo\\" by the composer Marin Goleminov, based on the overture of the same name by Dobri Hristov, was inspired by the \\"revolutionary pathos and tragedy of the epoch\\". Dedicated to the uprising are also the 1964 colour feature film \\"Ivaylo\\" by the director Nikola Valchev, based on the novel \\"The Smouldering Ember\\" by Evgeni Konstantinov, and the 1921 drama \\"The Throne\\" by the prominent Bulgarian poet and writer Ivan Vazov. The town of Ivaylovgrad in modern southern Bulgaria and the village of Ivaylo near the city of Pazardzhik are named after the rebel leader. There are statues in several cities dedicated to him, as well as a monument commemorating the victory over the Byzantines in the battle of Devina, situated at 5 km to the south-east of the town of Kotel. That memorial, named \\"The Stone Guard\\", was listed in the top ten emblematic monuments on the history of Bulgaria.

It was directed by Alfred Santell. The film stars Barbara Stanwyck, Herbert Marshall and Glenda Farrell. Stanwyck and Marshall worked together once more, immediately following this film, on the 20th-Century-Fox drama Always Goodbye (1938).http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/1865/Breakfast-for- Two/articles.html Plot After drunkenly carousing on the town, idle playboy, Jonathan Blair, wakes up to find that Texan Valentine Ransome has spent the night in his mansion. He remembers little of the night and knows little about his houseguest. Valentine is attracted to Jonathan and sets out first to reform and then to marry him, explaining to her horse-breaking uncle Sam that she intends to \\"slip a bit in his mouth and make him like it\\". In her way is Jonathan's girlfriend, actress Carol Wallace. Jonathan is dismayed to discover that his neglected family shipping firm is in dire trouble, and that he will not be receiving his usual check, leaving him broke. Valentine decides to use this news to ignite his ambition. She buys up controlling interest in the company and moves into his home as the new tenant. When he discovers the identity of the new owner, he wrongly assumes she went out with him solely to learn what she could about the company. Furious, he tells her that he will fight to get the company back, but later, to his valet, Butch, he admits he is beaten, as nobody will lend him the money he needs to make the attempt. Butch, who approves of Valentine, informs her of this. She makes Jonathan vice president, but he visits the office only to inform her that Carol has asked him to marry her, and that he has accepted. That afternoon, Valentine tries her best to disrupt the ceremony, with the help of noisy bearded window washers, presided over by an increasingly frustrated Justice of the Peace. Finally, Sam Ransome bursts in and declares that Carol is the mother of his children. The wedding is off, but one of the guests, Mr. Meggs, recognizes Sam and informs Jonathan. The next day, Jonathan outlines to the firm's receivership board his bold new plan to get the company back on its financial feet. The board members vote to accept his scheme and return control of the business to him. Valentine is pleased by his display of initiative and drive ... until he tells her that the wedding with Carol is back on. In desperation, Butch produces a forged marriage certificate showing that Valentine and Jonathan are husband and wife. Carol leaves in a huff. After Butch informs Valentine of the deception, she continues the masquerade, much to Jonathan's discomfort. When Butch confesses the truth to Jonathan, however, the tables are turned. She flees from her suddenly amorous \\"husband\\". However, at the train station, they make peace and get married for real.

Life Le Roy[ All Music Guide] (Retrieved 26 Aug 2009). was born in the town of Montreuil-sur-Mer in northern France to a wealthy family. Very little is known about his formative years, but he was probably a chorister and studied the lute, guitarIn those days \\"guitar\\" referred to an instrument with 4 courses ‚Äì see The Renaissance Guitar at Society of America Lute Society of America (retrieved on 26 Aug 2009). and cittern with various teachers. He became an accomplished musician and entered the service of, first, Claude de Clermont, then, Jacques II (Baron de Semblan√ßay and Viscount of Tours), both members of the aristocracy who had influence at court. In 1546 he met the publisher Jean de Brouilly in Paris and married his daughter Denise de Brouilly. Le Roy and his cousin Robert Ballard (c.1525‚Äì1588)Robert Ballard snr. (c.1527‚Äì1588), not to be confused with his son Robert Ballard (c.1575‚Äì1645), a distinguished lutenist and composer. In addition there was another Robert Ballard, nephew to the aforementioned lutenist who took over the publishing company of \\"Le Roy & Ballard\\" in 1639 (Music and Letters, vol. XLVI (1965), no. 4, pp. 375‚Äì6). founded the printing firm \\"Le Roy & Ballard\\", and in August 1551 obtained a royal privilege from Henry II to print music.Colin Clair: A History of European Printing (London: Academic Press, 1976), p. 213. In February 1553, the company was awarded the title of \\"Imprimeur du Roi en musique\\" (previously held by Pierre Attaignant). This office, which was renewed by successive monarchs, gave the company legal protection against competitors and commercially valuable prestige.See Harr, p. 172. Royal patronage was a major factor in the company's success since it ensured both a ready supply of new music from the court musicians and a market for its publications. Over the following two decades other rival companies dropped out of the market and from the 1570s onwards Le Roy & Ballard enjoyed a virtual monopoly in music publishing. The publishing house lasted to the 19th century.Waldo S. Pratt: The History of Music: A Handbook and Guide for Students (New York: G. Schirmer, 1907), p. 155. While Robert Ballard looked after the business side, Le Roy assumed the role of an artistic director. He achieved renown as a composer and arranger of songs and instrumentals, his published work including at least six books of tablature for the lute, five volumes for the guitar and arrangements for the cittern. Le Roy also helped to ensure the success of composer Orlande de Lassus, introducing him to court and publishing his music.see Adrian Le Roy (at \\"Virtual Baroque\\"). Le Roy's book L'Instruction pour la mandore gives modern historians hints as to the instruments origins and design. Although lost now, Pierre Trichet commented on things he read in Le Roy's book that tell us the instrument came to France by way of Navarre and Biscay. Trichet also lets us know that Le Roy, the author of a mandore method book, did own the instrument which he wrote about.James Tyler: The Mandore in the 16th and 17th Centuries.

Many citizens began to try to leave the country. Some had even begun to steal boats to flee. The clash began as police began securing boats to prevent theft. Riot Protesters' rage caused by the Special Period was vented into vandalism and violence, Many hotels were damaged, the police and communist party members were called in to disperse the crowd. Hundreds of protesters took to streets in Havana, some chanting \\"Libertad!\\" (Spanish for \\"freedom!\\"). The police eventually dispersed them all. Aftermath After the protests many Cubans attempted to flee the island. More than 35,000 left, many using rafts to float off the island to the United States. The U.S. president Bill Clinton enacted the wet foot dry foot policy as a reaction to the exodus. Castro came to support the exodus, viewing those who left as counterrevolutionaries.

In August 1903, Angelov was a delegate at the Ser region congress that took place in Livadkata, near the village of Pirin, where the action plan for the Ilinden- Preobrazhenie Uprising was developed. The congress appointed Angelov as leader of a band in the region of Demir Hisar. He and his band were given the task to investigate the possibilities to detonate the railroad bridge near Demir Hisar and the possibilities to seize the town itself. In the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising, he operated in the region of Demir Hisar together with Iliya Karchovaliyata and Lyubomir Stoenchev, but they did not manage to accomplish the plan to seize the town. When the uprising ended, Angelov and his revolutionary band went back to Bulgaria, where he joined again the Ninth regiment, but he continued to complete tasks given to him by the IMARO.

This plan envisaged female hospitals for women staffed exclusively by women, on a model sharing some features of London's Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital, which led to the founding of the London School of Medicine for Women. The plan was eventually rejected on grounds of cost, after heavy criticism from doctors and health professionals.Appendix: Chronology of Events Regarding Women in Iran since the Revolution of 1979 A similar plan to separate Iranian hospitals by gender, based on Vahid-Dastjerdi's original proposal, was enacted in 2006.A Minister in Support of Gender Separation The president of the Council of Iranian Medical Specialists described the plan as \\"not even realistic‚Äù because of the \\"shortage of female specialists in many cities\\".

Bradley's Barn is actually a recording studio in Nashville owned by Owen Bradley. Recording By 1968, bassist Ron Meagher had left the Beau Brummels after having been drafted into military service, reducing the band to a duo consisting of lead vocalist Sal Valentino and composer-guitarist Ron Elliott. They worked on a new album at Bradley's Barn, a recording studio in Wilson County, Tennessee, joined by prominent Nashville session musicians such as Kenny Buttrey, a drummer on Bob Dylan's albums from 1966‚Äì1969, and guitarist Jerry Reed. The Beau Brummels were so pleased with the results at the studio that they named the album Bradley's Barn. According to Elliott, the sound was not too different from the band's previous album, Triangle, just with more country accents. The Beau Brummels split up shortly after the album was completed, though they would reunite briefly in 1975.

This is typically given by an automaton. They could be found in penny arcades, and can be seen in modern video arcades and amusement parks. In media *In episode 43 Nick of Time (The Twilight Zone) of the American television anthology series The Twilight Zone. It originally aired on November 18, 1960, on CBS and was written by Richard Matheson. *In the 1988 Penny Marshall film Big, the main character, a child who wishes to be big, uses a \\"Zoltar\\" magical wishing machine very similar to a fortune teller machine that turns him into an adult. That machine was referenced in \\"Fortune in Flames\\", a second-season episode of the reality television series Pawn Stars. *In \\"The Honking\\", an episode of the animated TV series Futurama, the main characters, wishing to learn about a curse that has afflicted Bender, consult with a fortune teller machine, which, like many of the other machines of the 31st Century, is sentient. *In the eleventh and final series of Big Brother UK and the Ultimate Big Brother series, a fortune teller machine named Bob Righter (an anagram of Big Brother), was present in the main living area of the house. In the first few weeks of the series, after an eviction, the machine would tell a good or bad fortune to one of the current housemates. However, in a twist it was actually the evicted housemate who decided who would receive the good or bad fortune. *A Zoltar machine appears on the 2014 album Wishful Thinking by the Pop-Punk band Neck Deep, and the entire album cover is reminiscent of the 1988 comedy film Big. *A fortune telling machine named \\"Sallah, the Soothsaying Sultan\\" appears in Warehouse 13, during the episode \\"Insatiable\\". Its predictions have no bearing on reality; their only purpose is to cause extreme dread in whoever reads them. *In the episode \\"Fundamentals of Naked Portraiture\\" from the series Limitless, the main character, Brian Finch, uses the Zoltar machine comically in a scene to tell some guilty military members that their fortune is that they are all murderers. *In BioShock and BioShock 2, fortune teller machines called Epstein the Swami will give out pessimistic fortunes every time they are used. *In Grand Theft Auto Online, players can opt to place a \\"Nazar Speaks\\" machine inside their arcade which will tell players fortunes when used, many of which are references to either game mechanics or other Rockstar Games video games. *In Step Up 3, a Zoltar machine like the one from Big is seen when the dance crew enters the arcade at a fair. *In the music video of Poets of The Fall's Carnival of Rust, the singer of the band is dressed as a fortune teller. *In Call of Duty: Infinite Warfares Zombies mode there is a fortune telling machine that deals \\"Fate and Fortune\\" cards. *In season 4 of Wizards of Waverly Place episode \\"Misfortune at the Beach\\", the main characters receive fortunes from a machine, good and bad, that actually come to true. *In an episode of Batman: The Animated Series, entitled \\"Be A Clown\\", The Joker uses a fortune telling machine in the form of an old woman to seal Batman's fate. *In the episode of \\"Mechanical Genie Island\\" from the series The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack Flapjack and Captain K'nuckles get stranded on an island inhabited by the fortune telling machine in a form of genie that plays games with whoever comes on his island in order to cheat them into being his butlers for life. Later, it is revealed that Mechanical Genie is the toy of a giant baby. *In Batman Forever Edward Nygma in his apartment has the fortune telling machine in the form of a man dressed in a green suit with question marks all over it called The Guesser. Nygma took from it a major inspiration for creating the image of The Riddler. *In season 3 of Bunk'd, the campers find \\"The Great Balthazar\\", a fortune teller machine in the barn. One of the counselors, Lou, is uncomfortable with it, thinking that it's cursed. Near the end of the episode, she wants to smash it with a hammer back to \\"the underworld she believes that it came from\\" since she believes that was how the fortunes came true, until her friends give her a reasonable explanation. A camper, Matteo, tries proving it by getting a fortune saying that no one will see his true strength but when he fails to prove to her that it's just a game, another camper, Zuri, says \\"You didn't need to be Balthazar to see that coming\\". *In season 4 of Steven Universe, Steven accidentally breaks a fortune-teller machine called Zoltron at the amusement park Funland in his hometown of Beach City. As payment, the owner of Funland makes Steven dress up as Zoltron, sit in the machine, and play the role of Zoltron. *In season 2 of The Order, The Zoltar machine specifically from the film Big is seen in several episodes and said to \\"grant wishes ironically\\" inferring to the ironic wish that is granted in the film Big. *In the 1972 Peanuts animated movie Snoopy Come Home, while Charlie Brown and Peppermint Patty are at a carnival, they come across a fortune telling machine and decide to have their fortunes told. While the machine provides Peppermint Patty with a positive fortune (reading \\"You are a very loving person and your life will be forever filled with romance\\"), it provides Charlie Brown with a refusal (reading \\"Forget it, kid!\\": Charlie Brown gets a candy heart with the same words in Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown). Notable examples *Verbal Fortune Teller - Mills Novelty Co, c. 1904 - One unique machine, perhaps the only extant version in the world, survives in a museum in Virginia City, Montana. It features a recorded voice and eerie animatronics. \\"The 100-year-old fortune teller was an extremely rare find. Instead of dispensing a card like Zoltar, the Gypsy would actually speak your fortune from a hidden record player. When you dropped a penny in the slot, her eyes would flash, her teeth would chatter and her voice would come floating from a tube extending out of the eight-foot- tall box. This machine also provided fortunes for males and females separately\\". Reportedly, magician David Copperfield tried to buy the machine from the Montana State Historical Commission for two million dollars. Fortune Teller Machines are a rare artifact surviving from the era of penny arcade, boardwalk and amusement parks. Listed are a few of the notable varieties: *Madame Zita - A richly attired fortune teller in Gypsy style. The electric version was manufactured around 1905 by the Roover Brothers. *Grandmothers Predictions (Cleveland Grandma) - William Gent Mfg, c. 1929 - The wise old grandmother passes her hands over the fortune telling cards and stops at the proper fortune. The card falls into the tray below. *Princess Doraldina - Doraldina Corp, c. 1928 - Her youth and beauty attract the arcade customer. The machine's lifelike movements when granting fortunes make the process appear to be alive. *Geneco Gypsy Grandma Fortune Teller - Geneco Mfg., New York. NY c. 1940s-1950s - The central attraction of the original boardwalk and arcades was the \\"Gypsy Grandma\\" that comes to life after depositing a coin into a slot. Once a selection is made using a rotary dial that illuminates the player's astrological sign of choice, the animated Gypsy fortune teller moves her head above a lighted crystal ball while holding a fan of playing cards in her right hand and magic wand in her left hand. Featured sophisticated movements (nods, turns her head, breathes). Her right hand picks-up a fortune card from the enclosure that she opens with her left hand. She brings the card in front of her, turns her head, and then moves the card over the cauldron and drops it (which delivers the card to the patron).Geneco Gypsy Grandma Horoscope Fortune Teller, Gameroom Show. *Mike Munves Grandma's Prophesies Grandma Predicts Fortune Tellers. - Mike Munves Corp., New York, c. 1930s - One hand moves over the cards while the hand moves over the crystal ball, head turns from side to side, eyes move, and the chest \\"breathes\\", crystal ball glows as the machine dispenses a fortune card. *Mike Munves Deco ‚ÄúAsk Grandma‚Äù Fortune Teller. - Mike Munves Corp., New York - Ask Grandma Fortune Teller, Deco. Full size Grandma, life size with human movements (chest, both hands, eyes, head). The crystal ball glows once coin is inserted. She will scan the cards for a peek into your future, and then a fortune card will drop for the patron.Mike Munves Deco \\"Ask Grandma\\" Fortune Teller, Gameroom Show. *Estrella's Prophecies Fortune Teller - A coin-operated Gypsy-style fortune teller machine. A full size enclosed figure in elaborate oak cabinet. Her head moves from side to side, hand moves across the cards, while her left hand raises and then she slowly dispenses a fortune card through the ornate card slot. *Zoltan Fortune Teller - Deposit 25 cent coin, put receiver in your ear, press one of twelve zodiac sign button on the front of the machine (corresponds to the 12 signs of the zodiac). The crystal ball is lit by an eerie, red mystic light when Zoltan predicts fortune. Offers 1 to 12 Zoltan's fortunes in a heavily Hungarian accent. Zoltan usually begins his fortune telling with \\"This is Zoltan speaking\\" or \\"Greetings from Zoltan\\". The predictions, which last around one minute, include things about your future, lucky numbers, and favorable colors.Zoltan Fortune Teller, Gameroom Show.

Neighborhood representations The notion of an implicit graph is common in various search algorithms which are described in terms of graphs. In this context, an implicit graph may be defined as a set of rules to define all neighbors for any specified vertex.. This type of implicit graph representation is analogous to an adjacency list, in that it provides easy access to the neighbors of each vertex. For instance, in searching for a solution to a puzzle such as Rubik's Cube, one may define an implicit graph in which each vertex represents one of the possible states of the cube, and each edge represents a move from one state to another. It is straightforward to generate the neighbors of any vertex by trying all possible moves in the puzzle and determining the states reached by each of these moves; however, an implicit representation is necessary, as the state space of Rubik's Cube is too large to allow an algorithm to list all of its states. In computational complexity theory, several complexity classes have been defined in connection with implicit graphs, defined as above by a rule or algorithm for listing the neighbors of a vertex. For instance, PPA is the class of problems in which one is given as input an undirected implicit graph (in which vertices are -bit binary strings, with a polynomial time algorithm for listing the neighbors of any vertex) and a vertex of odd degree in the graph, and must find a second vertex of odd degree. By the handshaking lemma, such a vertex exists; finding one is a problem in NP, but the problems that can be defined in this way may not necessarily be NP-complete, as it is unknown whether PPA = NP. PPAD is an analogous class defined on implicit directed graphs that has attracted attention in algorithmic game theory because it contains the problem of computing a Nash equilibrium. The problem of testing reachability of one vertex to another in an implicit graph may also be used to characterize space- bounded nondeterministic complexity classes including NL (the class of problems that may be characterized by reachability in implicit directed graphs whose vertices are -bit bitstrings), SL (the analogous class for undirected graphs), and PSPACE (the class of problems that may be characterized by reachability in implicit graphs with polynomial-length bitstrings). In this complexity-theoretic context, the vertices of an implicit graph may represent the states of a nondeterministic Turing machine, and the edges may represent possible state transitions, but implicit graphs may also be used to represent many other types of combinatorial structure.. PLS, another complexity class, captures the complexity of finding local optima in an implicit graph.. Implicit graph models have also been used as a form of relativization in order to prove separations between complexity classes that are stronger than the known separations for non-relativized models. For instance, Childs et al. used neighborhood representations of implicit graphs to define a graph traversal problem that can be solved in polynomial time on a quantum computer but that requires exponential time to solve on any classical computer.. Adjacency labeling schemes In the context of efficient representations of graphs, J. H. Muller defined a local structure or adjacency labeling scheme for a graph in a given family of graphs to be an assignment of an -bit identifier to each vertex of , together with an algorithm (that may depend on but is independent of the individual graph ) that takes as input two vertex identifiers and determines whether or not they are the endpoints of an edge in . That is, this type of implicit representation is analogous to an adjacency matrix: it is straightforward to check whether two vertices are adjacent but finding the neighbors of any vertex may involve looping through all vertices and testing which ones are neighbors.. Graph families with adjacency labeling schemes include: ;Bounded degree graphs: If every vertex in has at most neighbors, one may number the vertices of from 1 to and let the identifier for a vertex be the -tuple of its own number and the numbers of its neighbors. Two vertices are adjacent when the first numbers in their identifiers appear later in the other vertex's identifier. More generally, the same approach can be used to provide an implicit representation for graphs with bounded arboricity or bounded degeneracy, including the planar graphs and the graphs in any minor- closed graph family.. ;Intersection graphs: An interval graph is the intersection graph of a set of line segments in the real line. It may be given an adjacency labeling scheme in which the points that are endpoints of line segments are numbered from 1 to 2n and each vertex of the graph is represented by the numbers of the two endpoints of its corresponding interval. With this representation, one may check whether two vertices are adjacent by comparing the numbers that represent them and verifying that these numbers define overlapping intervals. The same approach works for other geometric intersection graphs including the graphs of bounded boxicity and the circle graphs, and subfamilies of these families such as the distance-hereditary graphs and cographs. However, a geometric intersection graph representation does not always imply the existence of an adjacency labeling scheme, because it may require more than a logarithmic number of bits to specify each geometric object. For instance, representing a graph as a unit disk graph may require exponentially many bits for the coordinates of the disk centers.. ;Low-dimensional comparability graphs: The comparability graph for a partially ordered set has a vertex for each set element and an edge between two set elements that are related by the partial order. The order dimension of a partial order is the minimum number of linear orders whose intersection is the given partial order. If a partial order has bounded order dimension, then an adjacency labeling scheme for the vertices in its comparability graph may be defined by labeling each vertex with its position in each of the defining linear orders, and determining that two vertices are adjacent if each corresponding pair of numbers in their labels has the same order relation as each other pair. In particular, this allows for an adjacency labeling scheme for the chordal comparability graphs, which come from partial orders of dimension at most four... The implicit graph conjecture Not all graph families have local structures. For some families, a simple counting argument proves that adjacency labeling schemes do not exist: only bits may be used to represent an entire graph, so a representation of this type can only exist when the number of -vertex graphs in the given family is at most . Graph families that have larger numbers of graphs than this, such as the bipartite graphs or the triangle-free graphs, do not have adjacency labeling schemes.. However, even families of graphs in which the number of graphs in the family is small might not have an adjacency labeling scheme; for instance, the family of graphs with fewer edges than vertices has -vertex graphs but does not have an adjacency labeling scheme, because one could transform any given graph into a larger graph in this family by adding a new isolated vertex for each edge, without changing its labelability. Kannan et al. asked whether having a forbidden subgraph characterization and having at most -vertex graphs are together enough to guarantee the existence of an adjacency labeling scheme; this question, which Spinrad restated as a conjecture, remains open. Among the families of graphs which satisfy the conditions of the conjecture and for which there is no known adjacency labeling scheme are the family of disk graphs and line segment intersection graphs. Labeling schemes and induced universal graphs If a graph family has an adjacency labeling scheme, then the -vertex graphs in may be represented as induced subgraphs of a common induced universal graph of polynomial size, the graph consisting of all possible vertex identifiers. Conversely, if an induced universal graph of this type can be constructed, then the identities of its vertices may be used as labels in an adjacency labeling scheme.. For this application of implicit graph representations, it is important that the labels use as few bits as possible, because the number of bits in the labels translates directly into the number of vertices in the induced universal graph. Alstrup and Rauhe showed that any tree has an adjacency labeling scheme with bits per label, from which it follows that any graph with arboricity k has a scheme with bits per label and a universal graph with vertices. In particular, planar graphs have arboricity at most three, so they have universal graphs with a nearly- cubic number of vertices.. This bound was improved by Gavoille and Labourel who showed that planar graphs and minor-closed graph families have a labeling scheme with bits per label, and that graphs of bounded treewidth have a labeling scheme with bits per label.. Evasiveness The Aanderaa‚ÄìKarp‚ÄìRosenberg conjecture concerns implicit graphs given as a set of labeled vertices with a black-box rule for determining whether any two vertices are adjacent. This definition differs from an adjacency labeling scheme in that the rule may be specific to a particular graph rather than being a generic rule that applies to all graphs in a family. Because of this difference, every graph has an implicit representation. For instance, the rule could be to look up the pair of vertices in a separate adjacency matrix. However, an algorithm that is given as input an implicit graph of this type must operate on it only through the implicit adjacency test, without reference to how the test is implemented. A graph property is the question of whether a graph belongs to a given family of graphs; the answer must remain invariant under any relabeling of the vertices. In this context, the question to be determined is how many pairs of vertices must be tested for adjacency, in the worst case, before the property of interest can be determined to be true or false for a given implicit graph. Rivest and Vuillemin proved that any deterministic algorithm for any nontrivial graph property must test a quadratic number of pairs of vertices.. The full Aanderaa‚ÄìKarp‚ÄìRosenberg conjecture is that any deterministic algorithm for a monotonic graph property (one that remains true if more edges are added to a graph with the property) must in some cases test every possible pair of vertices. Several cases of the conjecture have been proven to be true‚Äîfor instance, it is known to be true for graphs with a prime number of vertices.‚Äîbut the full conjecture remains open. Variants of the problem for randomized algorithms and quantum algorithms have also been studied. Bender and Ron have shown that, in the same model used for the evasiveness conjecture, it is possible in only constant time to distinguish directed acyclic graphs from graphs that are very far from being acyclic. In contrast, such a fast time is not possible in neighborhood-based implicit graph models,.

(MASI). Seafood bearing the Safe Harbor seal is tested for overall mercury content to be under the FDA's action level of 1ppm, histamine, Escherichia coli O157:H7(E.coli O157:H7) and salmonella. Every large fin fish is individually tested by MASI personnel so the maximum mercury level in that fish does not exceed the limit set for that species. In addition, most shellfish and farmed species of catfish, shrimp and tilapia are screened for E.coli O157:H7 and Salmonella while exotic species like tuna, mahi mahi and swordfish are tested for scombroid food poisoning see histamine. Fish that are not individually tested (fish generally known to be lower in mercury, two lbs and under) are batch tested using an ANSI approved sampling algorithm ensuring a 95% confidence rate that the respective lot being tested falls under the Safe Harbor standard set for that species. Company In 2002, Micro Analytical Systems, Inc. (MASI) developed technology for testing seafood for its mercury concentration. A decade of research and development led to the development of a proprietary technology that can test any tissue sample for overall mercury concentrations. Tissue samples are extracted using a modified biopsy needle with quantitative results registering in less than 60 seconds. In contrast to other conventional testing procedures, the nature of the technology and the speed of the testing process not only allows the sample to then be consumed, the testing can be done in real-time in processing and distribution facilities, on the production line. According to their data, MASI has conducted over 200,000 tests on seafood to determine its mercury concentration and presence of histamine and harmful pathogens. In 2010, MASI began testing for E.coli O157 :H7 and Salmonella through the use of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) based technology. In addition, MASI also began testing for histamine, a product of spoilage due to time and temperature abuse usually as a result of improper handling, temperature control and elevated levels of histamine producing bacteria in the marine environment. MASI uses the competitive ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) method for the screening of histamine in scombroid species of fish.

The Finsbury East by-election, 1918 was a parliamentary by-election held for the House of Commons constituency of East Finsbury in north London on 16 July 1918. Vacancy The by-election was caused by the death on 3 July 1918 of the sitting Liberal Party MP Joseph Allen Baker, who had held the seat since himself winning it in a by-election on 29 June 1905.The Times, 30 June 1905 p12 Electoral history Candidates Evan Cotton Liberals Finsbury Liberal Association adopted Evan Cotton as their candidate to replace Baker.The Times, 10 July 1918 p6 Cotton was born in India, the son of Henry John Stedman Cotton, a colonial administrator and himself a Liberal MP who sat for Nottingham East from 1906-1910. H. E. A. Cotton was then aged 50 years and had been Progressive Party member of the London County Council for East Finsbury since 1910.The Times, 13 July 1918 p3 He was a barrister, having been called to the bar at Lincoln‚Äôs Inn in 1893 and a journalist.Who was Who, OUP 2007 Conservatives As participants in the wartime coalition with Prime Minister David Lloyd George, the Conservatives chose not to contest the by- election and endorsed Cotton as the government candidate.The Times, 10 July 1918 p6 Labour Even though the Labour party had withdrawn from the wartime electoral truce, they too chose not to contest the election. Independents Mr Charles Lamble, the Chairman of the Government Temporary Clerks‚Äô Association, announced he would be standing in the election. He said he would stand as a supporter of the government but that he would be pressing for the redress of existing grievances in the Civil Service and the immediate implementation of the Whitley Report The Times, 6 July 1918 p3 ‚Äì an inquiry into the feasibility of setting up Industrial Councils in industry and administration to improve industrial relations and increase efficiency.https://archive.org/details/industrialcounci00greauoft However in the end, Lamble decided not to fight the election. There were however two Independents who did contest the by-election. Mr A S Belsher was a solicitor's managing clerk and Chairman of the London Licensed Victuallers Central Protection Board. Belsher had obtained the support of the Merchant Seamen's League. The League had resolved to boycott German goods after the war in retaliation for the U-Boat attacks on merchant shipping. They could not get Cotton to support their cause so switched allegiance to Belsher.The Times, 13 July 1918 p3 The second Independent was H S Spencer, an honorary Captain in the Royal Irish Fusiliers and an examiner in the Aeronautical Inspection Directorate of the Royal Air Force. Spencer was said to have the support of the Vigilante Society,The Times, 13 July 1918 p3 an extreme right-wing group which campaigned against enemy aliens and what they described as ‚Äònaturalised enemies‚Äô in Britain. They wanted the British Empire to be reserved for what they called British people.The Times, 17 June 1918 p5 Issues The only real issue seems to have been the prosecution of the war and the nationalistic atmosphere the war was stirring up against the Germans. The candidates were all competing to see who would come across toughest on measures such as the Defence of the Realm Act, internment of enemy aliens or boycotting of goods and services from those who were German or believed to have German ancestry.The Times, 15 July 1918 p3 This mood continued right up until polling day with the two Independent candidates‚Äô supporters engaged in rowdyism and violence against each other.16 July 1918 p3 Result In a wartime contest on a clearly out of date electoral register Cotton easily retained the seat for the government with a majority of 580 votes over Spencer. Turnout was only 38.7%.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1885-1918; Macmillan Press, 1974 p14 The result was an endorsement by the electorate for the government‚Äôs handling of the war effort, both in military terms and on the home front. Cotton‚Äôs vote was also seen as a rejection of the kind of political violence which had marred the by-election and which was chiefly associated with the campaigns of Spencer and Belsher.The Times, 17 July 1918 p6 The Times newspaper reported that Cotton had not been a good candidate, a weak campaigner and inconsistent on the German boycott. They reported that although he was selected to represent the government under the party truce it was likely on his record that he would gravitate to the opposition, i.e. to the rival wing of the Liberal Party led by H H Asquith.The Times, 18 July 1918 p7 The message The Times believed the government should take from the election was to have ‚Äòstout-hearted and patriotic candidates‚Äô in the field come the general election.The Times, 18 July 1918 p7 Aftermath As far as East Finsbury and Cotton were concerned, however, the election was an academic exercise. The constituency disappeared in boundary changes at the 1918 general election just a few months later. Cotton, contested the successor seat of Finsbury but he was not awarded the Coupon which went to Lt-Col. Martin Archer-Shee DSO.The Times House of Commons 1919; Politico‚Äôs Publishing 2004 p19 Archer-Shee had been MP for Finsbury Central since 1910.

Initially associated with the right wing Christian Social Party, he later became involved in a National Socialist coup d'√©tat plot. Early years Rintelen was the son of a well-known lawyer and studied law at University of Graz from 1894 to 1898, at which pointed he began lecturing in civil law at the university. He would later serve as a professor at the same institute.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, Simon & Schuster, 1990, p. 323 He was also a professor at the Charles University in Prague before taking up a career in politics with the Christian Social Party.Profile He served the party as Landeshauptmann of Styria from 1919 to 1926 and again from 1928 to 1933 and as Minister of Education in 1926 and 1932-3. Rintelen was also the founder and President of Steirer Bank although the scandal that followed the collapse of this initiative in 1926 was enough to see him lose his role as Landeshauptmann for a period. In his role in Styria he was active in supporting the local Heimwehr leader Walter Pfrimer.F. L. Carsten, The Rise of Fascism, 1982, p. 223 He also maintained close links with another right-wing militia leader Georg Escherich. Rintelen's links to the far right made him a target for leftists and in May 1921 a group of miners in St. Lorenzen attacked Rintelen, throwing him out a window and stoning him. Rintelen hoped to use the Heimwehr and related groups as a personal army to launch his own version of the March on Rome and indeed he even tried unsuccessfully to enlist the aid of Benito Mussolini in this venture. He was sent to Rome in 1933 as Ambassador to Italy. Here he became involved in intrigues with NSDAP leaders from Austria and Germany and worked to push Italian sentiments towards National Socialism.Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right, p. 324 July Revolution Despite having been a member of his government Rintelen had become an opponent of Engelbert Dollfuss; and the Austrian National Socialist Party, at the time planning a coup d'√©tat under the direction of Theodor Habicht, Rudolf Weydenhammer and Fridolin Glass, brought him into their conspiracy as a prospective Chancellor in 1934.H.

It is located in Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico in Technical Area 53 (TA-53). It was the most powerful linear accelerator in the world when it was opened in June 1972.30th anniversary of LAMPF/LANSCE Accelerator. Los Alamos National Lab, June 24, 2002 The technology used in the accelerator was developed in part by the nuclear physicist Louis Rosen. The facility is capable of accelerating protons up to 800 MeV. Multiple beamlines allow for a variety of experiments to be run at once, and the facility is used for many types of research in materials testing and neutron science. It is also used for medical radioisotope production. LANSCE provides the scientific community with intense sources of neutrons with the capability of performing experiments supporting civilian and national security research. The Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration, Office of Science, Office of Nuclear Energy, and Office of Science and Technology ‚Äì the principal sponsors of LANSCE ‚Äì have synergistic long-term needs for the accelerator and neutron science that is the heart of LANSCE. LANSCE serves an international user community conducting diverse forefront basic and applied research. History Since 1972, the 800-million- electronvolt (MeV) accelerator and its attendant facilities at Technical Area 53 (TA-53, often referred to as \\"the Mesa\\") at Los Alamos National Laboratory have been a resource to a broad international community of scientific researchers. The Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility (LAMPF), as it was originally called, hosted about 1000 users per year to perform medium energy physics experiments. In 1977, a pulsed spallation neutron source was commissioned to supply moderated and unmoderated neutrons to time-of-flight experiments in the facility called the Weapons Neutron Research (WNR) Center. Neutron scattering experiments were started immediately and by 1983 the Department of Energy's Office of Basic Energy Sciences was funding a formal user program. Beginning in 1985, with the completion of the Proton Storage Ring (PSR) that compresses proton pulses from 750 microseconds to a quarter of a microsecond, the Los Alamos Neutron Scattering Center (LANSCE), now known as the Lujan Center, was established while WNR was expanded to other spallation sources on the accelerator beam. In 1995 LAMPF was renamed the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) to reflect the broad base of neutron research being conducted on behalf of the weapons program and basic research; the name of the BES neutron scattering facility was simultaneously changed from LANSCE to the Manuel Lujan Jr. Neutron Scattering Center. In 1996, a Memorandum of Understanding was established between the Department of Energy's Offices of Energy Research (ER) and Defense Programs (DP) to define the stewardship of the facility and its experimental areas in the context of the new Scientific Stockpile Stewardship Program. In 2001, the MOU was rewritten to include three branches of the Department of Energy (DOE)‚Äîthe National Nuclear Security Administration Defense Program (DP), the Office of Science (SC), and the Office of Nuclear Energy (NE)‚Äîand the Laboratory officially designated LANSCE as an approved user facility. Several key events have occurred during the last 20 years that have fostered the growth of the user programs at LANSCE. In 1968 through 1995, the DOE Office of Energy Research (ER) funded LAMPF as a user facility for medium energy physics and a user group was incorporated in 1972. Beginning approximately in 1977, Office of Basic Energy Sciences has provided funding of a new experimental area completed in 1990, including office space, the Los Alamos Neutron Scattering Center (later the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center) became a Designated National User Facility. LANSCE into the Future. Los Alamos Science No. 30, 2006 In 2011, this status was extended to WNR and pRad. Facilities Users conduct research at five facilities at LANSCE: Isotope Production Facility (IPF), Lujan Neutron Scattering Center (Lujan Center), Proton Radiography Facility (pRad), Ultracold neutrons (UCN), and Weapons Neutron Research Facility (WNR) Isotope Production Facility :Los Alamos National Laboratory produces radioactive isotopes for medical, environmental, industrial as well as research applications. The Isotope Production Facility (IPF) at LANSCE supplies a wide range of radioisotopes to researchers all over the world and has been a leader in developing and producing new and unique isotopes for research and development. Lujan Neutron Scattering Center :The Lujan Neutron Scattering Center (Lujan Center) employs a pulsed spallation neutron source equipped with time-of- flight spectrometers for neutron scattering studies. Neutron scattering is a powerful technique for probing the microscopic structure and dynamics and is used in materials science, engineering, condensed matter physics, chemistry, biology, and geology. Proton Radiography Facility :The Proton Radiography Facility (pRad) uses 800 MeV protons provided by the LANSCE accelerator facility, to investigate dynamic experiments in support of national and international weapons science and stockpile stewardship programs. Ultracold neutrons :Researchers working at LANSCE and eight other member institutions of an international collaboration are constructing the most intense source of ultra-cold neutrons in the world, measuring ultra-cold neutron production in their new source for the first time. The ultra-cold neutron extraction port at LANSCE delivers neutrons from the new ultra-cold neutron source for experiments that could answer questions about the fundamental constants of nature and aid in the quest for new particles. Weapons Neutron Research Facility :The Weapons Neutron Research Facility (WNR) provides neutron and proton beams for basic, applied, and defense- related research. Neutron beams with energies ranging from about 0.1 MeV to more than 600 MeV are produced in Target 4 (an unmoderated tungsten spallation source) using the 800 MeV proton beam from the LANSCE linac. In the Target-2 area (Blue Room) samples can be exposed to the direct 800 MeV proton beam. User Program A significant number of students and postdoctoral researchers who become familiar with the Laboratory through their experiences at LANSCE become part of the permanent workforce, joining many different technical organizations. The User Program at LANSCE. LANSCE into the Future Los Alamos Science No. 30, 2006 User Demographics The User Program's demographics count user visits and unique-users. User visits are the total number of visits by all users. A unique-user is defined as counting a user only once‚Äî the first time they come to LANSCE during a calendar year. The largest segment of unique-users at the Lujan Center came from the academic community; at WNR users come from academic, industrial, and national laboratories. A majority of the WNR industry users are from firms that produce or use semiconductor devices. The semiconductor industry relies on WNR's unique capabilities to test their latest generation of chips for resistance to neutron-induced upsets. Neutron-induced upsets produced by energetic neutrons are important due to the natural production of high-energy neutrons by cosmic rays.

It is an independent self-regulatory agency for the promotion of responsible advertising to children under the age of 12 in all media. CARU reviews and evaluates advertising for truth, accuracy, appropriateness and sensitivity to children‚Äôs still developing cognitive abilities in accordance with its Self-Regulatory Program for Children's Advertising (the Guidelines) and relevant laws. CARU monitors advertisements found in broadcast and cable TV, radio, children‚Äôs magazines, comic books, the Internet and mobile services for compliance with its Guidelines. When ads are found to be misleading, inaccurate or inconsistent with its Guidelines, CARU seeks changes through voluntary cooperation. The results of CARU inquiries are publicly recorded in the NAD/CARU Case Reports. CARU also handles advertiser challenges and consumer complaints. In 1996, CARU added a section to its Guidelines that highlight issues that are unique to the Internet including Websites directed at children under age 13 for online privacy. These Guidelines served as the basis of the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA).The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) is a United States federal law, located at (). In January 2001, CARU's self- regulatory program became the first Federal Trade Commission-approved Safe Harbor under COPPA. Participants who adhere to CARU's Guidelines are deemed in compliance with COPPA and essentially insulated from FTC enforcement action as long as they comply with program requirements. CARU, operating under the principle that self-regulation is best supported by education, provides a general advisory service for advertisers and agencies and has created publications to help parents help their kids understand advertising. CARU has an Advisory Board, composed of leading experts in education, communications, child development and nutrition, as well as industry leaders. The Board advises on general issues concerning children‚Äôs advertising and assists in the continuous development of the Guidelines. CARU‚ÄôS Guidelines CARU's Self- Regulatory Guidelines are deliberately subjective, going beyond the issues of truthfulness and accuracy to take into account the uniquely impressionable and vulnerable child audience. The Guidelines are based upon the following core principles: #Advertisers have special responsibilities when advertising to children or collecting data from children online. They should take into account the limited knowledge, experience, sophistication and maturity of the audience to which the message is directed. They should recognize that younger children have a limited capacity to evaluate the credibility of information, may not understand the persuasive intent of advertising, and may not even understand that they are being subject to advertising. #Advertising should be neither deceptive nor unfair, as these terms are applied under the Federal Trade Commission Act, to the children to whom it is directed. #Advertisers should have adequate substantiation for objective advertising claims, as those claims are reasonably interpreted by the children to whom they are directed. #Advertising should not stimulate children‚Äôs unreasonable expectations about product quality or performance. #Products and content inappropriate for children should not be advertised directly to them. #Advertisers should avoid social stereotyping and appeals to prejudice, and are encouraged to incorporate minority and other groups in advertisements and to present positive role models whenever possible. #Advertisers are encouraged to capitalize on the potential of advertising to serve an educational role and influence positive personal qualities and behaviors in children, e.g., being honest and respectful of others, taking safety precautions, engaging in physical activity. #Although there are many influences that affect a child‚Äôs personal and social development, it remains the prime responsibility of the parents to provide guidance for children. Advertisers should contribute to this parent-child relationship in a constructive manner.

Its goal is to encourage the installation of solar water heating systems in Toronto homes through financial incentives and other support to both homeowners and the local solar industry. Phase I (2008-2009) of the pilot project is targeting homes in Toronto‚Äôs Ward 30. The program was developed based on a directive in Toronto‚Äôs ‚ÄúClimate Change, Clean Air and Sustainable Energy Action Plan‚Äù, which was approved by Toronto City Council in June 2007. Name Official named the Toronto Solar Neighbourhoods Initiative, the pilot program is referred to as \\"Solar Neighbourhoods\\" for short. Funding Solar Neighbourhoods was made possible by a provincially mandated grant of $400,000 from the Portlands Energy Centre, a natural gas-based power plant located within Ward 30, to go toward local air quality initiatives. Process The Solar Neighbourhoods program offers incentives of up to $1,000 towards the purchase of solar water heating systems for eligible residents. Those who participate can choose to receive $1,000 up-front towards the cost of their system or a $500 up-front rebate along with zero-interest financing to cover the cost of the system (up to $10,000). In order to qualify for these savings homeowners must live within Ward 30, and have an ecoENERGY home assessment with the selected auditing partner, Windfall Ecology Centre. This ecoENERGY assessment is necessary to access federal and provincial government solar hot water incentives, as well as incentives for a number of other home energy improvements through the ecoENERGY-Retrofit Homes program. The installation must be done by a Solar Neighbourhoods eligible contractor who has met basic requirements, including Canadian Solar Industry Association (CanSIA) membership, using CanSIA certified installers, providing basic labour and equipment warranties, and maintaining adequate WSIB and commercial insurance. This incentive can be received in conjunction with other government incentives such as the ecoENERGY incentive, Ontario Home Energy Savings Program and 2009 Home Renovation Tax Credit. Community Partners Solar Neighbourhoods works in conjunction with a local solar buying club called the Riverdale Initiative for Solar Energy (RISE Again), which is bringing together neighbours in Riverdale to purchase both solar water heating systems and solar photovoltaic systems. A number of community solar buying groups exist across Toronto and southern Ontario, and are working together under the OurPower.ca umbrella.

He played with the band on their 2009 United States reunion tour with Staind and their 2010 Tour with Skillet. He is the former lead guitarist for the band Submersed and also the former lead guitarist for Daughters of Mara. Submersed and Daughters of Mara both disbanded in 2008. He also currently plays lead guitar and co writes for the rock band Hemme. At the age of thirteen Friedman was the youngest guitarist at the time to be fully endorsed by Fender. His first introduction to Mark Tremonti was at a NAMM show where his then manager introduced them both. They subsequently jammed at one of the Rivera amp booths and noticed, that although they had different styles, (Tremonti being heavily influenced by metal and Friedman Blues), they both complemented each other. Music career Early years It all started for Friedman when his teenage guitar hero Kenny Wayne Shepherd pulled him onstage for a jam session during his set at the Galaxy Theatre (Santa Ana, CA) in 1996. Shortly after he began playing in his own blues outfit called The Eric Friedman Band and was endorsed by Fender at the age of 13. Eric opened up for acts such as Buddy Guy, Jimmie Vaughan, and Jonny Lang. He had a developmental record deal with Steve Vai's label Favored Nations at 15. Submersed In 2000, Eric started a rock band called Blacsun that had demos produced by Brett Hestla (Virgos, Dark New Day). In the same year, he became the lead guitarist for the band Submersed. He performed on their debut album, In Due Time. Friedman left prior to the band's second album, Immortal Verses, which was released later that year before the band disbanded in 2008. He was also the guitarist for Daughters of Mara during this time, who also broke up in 2008. He then went on to play with former TNA Impact Wrestling star Christy Hemme along with former Submersed drummer, Garrett Whitlock. Creed In addition to Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Friedman is influenced by Mark Tremonti of Creed and Alter Bridge and has since formed a close friendship with Tremonti, who requested for Friedman to perform as Creed's rhythm guitarist on tour. Friedman states that he grew up listening to Creed's music, particularly their debut album My Own Prison. While on tour with Creed, he provides rhythm guitar and backing vocals. He also performs a guitar solo with Tremonti on \\"What If.\\" He appeared as a touring member on Creed's record-breaking live DVD, Creed Live. It has also been announced that Creed will reportedly be releasing a new song called \\"More Than This\\" which will feature Friedman on guitar. Friedman has also appeared in interviews and several promotional photos and videos. All of this has led to rumors of Friedman officially joining Creed, and the band has stated that they have discussed this, but nothing has been confirmed. Friedman returned to Creed in 2012 for the band's 2 Nights Tour. Tremonti Friedman was featured on Mark Tremonti's debut solo album, All I Was, playing guitar, bass and singing background vocals. He is featured in the music video of \\"You Waste Your Time\\" He is a current member of the band and was part of the album, Cauterize, that was released in June 2015, and part of Dust, which was released in April 2016. Projected In 2012, Friedman joined the supergroup Projected, alongside Sevendust's John Connolly, Vinnie Hornsby and Creed/Alter Bridge drummer Scott Phillips. Their debut album Human was released on September 18, 2012. Their recent work was Ignite My Insanity which was released under Rat Pak Records in July 21, 2017.

Bowles is largely credited for bringing the Colorado & Southern Railroad to the present-day Westminster area. Bowles came from Missouri to the Colorado Territory at age 17. In 1871, at about 24 years of age he married Mahala, and they homesteaded the land on which the house stands. Bowles was the second pioneer settler in the area, after Pleasant DeSpain who arrived in 1870 and whose farm was to the north of the Bowles House. The Bowles House was originally constructed as a wood frame homestead cabin (no longer extant) but was rebuilt entirely from brick in 1876. The house was unusual for a rural ranch setting, as it included stylish and costly features: rounded windows, decorative brackets under the eaves, rooftop cresting, bargeboards on the gables, and an elaborate front porch. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. The Bowles House was recognized as one of the earliest and most detailed examples of Italianate style in Westminster and as an icon of early Westminster settlement. The house is owned by the City of Westminster and operated as a historic house museum by the Westminster Historical Society.

Operations in C√°diz preceding the battle After the ending of the Anglo-Dutch War, Oliver Cromwell turned his attention to England's traditional enemy, Spain. He was seeking a return to a policy of attacks on Spanish trade and shipping routes, whose success in the time of Elizabeth I had acquired a legendary status. In August 1655, Robert Blake had blockaded the port of C√°diz in the hope of intercepting a Spanish treasure fleet, but it did not sail and remained in the Americas. The fleet sailed to England for a refit in October 1655, before returning the following April. During this time a Spanish fleet had docked in C√°diz, and the harbor was deemed too well defended to attack successfully. Consequently, the two generals leading the English fleet (Blake and Edward Montagu) sailed for Tangier to take on water and supplies. From Tangier the best ships in the fleet sailed to Lisbon to support the ratification of a treaty between Portugal and England, before returning full attention to the blockade. This continued throughout summer 1656 as the Spanish avoided any aggressive actions, allowing the majority of the English fleet to raid ports all over Spain and North Africa (including Vigo and M√°laga, where they sunk 9 Spanish ships.) 10 of the 40 ships in the fleet were recalled to England in July, before all but 8 of the remaining ships sailed to Lisbon once again to restock the fleet. These 8 ships were left in the command of Richard Stayner in order to continue the blockade of C√°diz. The battle Stayner's fleet was stationed in C√°diz bay to begin with, but was forced out by a westerly gale. On the evening of September 8, the squadron sighted one of the two annual Spanish treasure fleets. The treasure fleet, under the command of Marcos del Puerto, consisted of two galleons, three private merchantmen, two armed cargo ships (hulks) and a captured Portuguese vessel. They had been anchored in Havana for two months waiting for some warship escorts, but the earlier (still ongoing) blockade of C√°diz by Blake had prevented any from reaching the flota. In the gathering darkness, the Spaniards mistook the English squadron for a group of fishing boats and took no evasive action. As dawn broke on the morning of September 9, 1656, three of the English ships engaged the Spanish (the remainder of the squadron was facing the wrong way to attack at that time.) Captain Stayner, aboard the Speaker (64 guns), engaged and captured the Jesus Maria San Jose (28), one of the flota's galleons under the command of rear admiral Juan de Hoyos. With its capture came its treasure of 45 tons of silver, 700 chests of indigo, and 700 chests of sugar. Meanwhile, Captain Anthony Earning of the Bridgewater (52) engaged the other galleon under the command of vice admiral Juan Rodriguez Calder√≥n. After a lengthy battle, the galleon was sunk after its crew set it on fire while abandoning ship. only 90 of its crew survived, with one of the many Spanish casualties being Francisco L√≥pez de Z√∫√±iga, 2nd Marquis of Baides, the former Governor of Chile. His wife and daughter died also, and his two young sons were taken prisoner. The Plymouth (52) sank one of the Spanish merchantmen, sending 60,000 pieces of eight being carried as cargo down with the ship. Captain John Harman of the Tredagh (52) captured another merchantman intact with all its cargo. The third merchantman was beached, while the Spanish admiral Marcus del Puerto escaped on the San Francisco y San Diego to C√°diz harbour along with the 2 other smallest ships. The battle was a huge loss for the Spanish, with the English taking nearly ¬£1 million in goods, another ¬£250,000 in Silver, as well as hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of treasure lost to the ocean depths.

He travelled to Paris in 1938, where the study of work by French artists broadened his approach away from an academic direction towards a delineated and sculptural Expressionist style, which he pursued after his return to Peru in 1942. Guti√©rrez' masterpiece is a depiction of a powerful and crude nude woman, The Andes (1943), representing \\"the unavoidable South American reality.\\" He was not an intellectual and this may explain how the tenor of his work is that of a \\"direct, living testimony.\\" His interest in sculpture was stimulated by his apprenticeship under Pettoruti, and although he did not produce many works of this kind, his sculpture Amazonia won first prize in a competition in 1942. The influence of other European avant-garde styles did not affect him, and for some time he incorporated the influence of the Peruvian Indigenist manner in his work. Subsequently his Expressionist tendencies intensified with techniques such as scoring the paint surface to create textural effects and heightening his colours with gestural marks of black, red, blue and green paint, leading at the beginning of the 1950s to such works such as Don Juan (1952). This direction intensified with a violent Fauvist manner into mystical subjects, including St Rosa de Lima (c. 1960‚Äì61).

United States, 398 U.S. 58 (1970), was a United States Supreme Court case, which ruled that actors could wear accurate military uniforms‚Äîregardless of the production's portrayal of the military‚Äîon First Amendment grounds.. Background On December 4th, 1967, Daniel Jay Schacht and his friend, Jarrett Vander Smith, along with a third party, participated in a nationally coordinated protest of the Vietnam War by participating in a skit demonstrating the murder of Vietnamese civilians by the U.S. Military. The skit \\"was composed of three people. There was Schacht who was dressed in a uniform and cap. A second person [Smith] was wearing ‚Äòmilitary colored‚Äô coveralls. The third person was outfitted in typical Viet Cong apparel. The first two men carried water pistols. One of them would yell, ‚ÄòBe an able American,‚Äô and then they would shoot the Viet Cong with their pistols. The pistols expelled a red liquid which, when it struck the victim, created the impression that he was bleeding. Once the victim fell down the other two would walk up to him and exclaim, ‚ÄòMy God, this is a pregnant woman.‚Äô Without noticeable variation this skit was reenacted several times during the morning of the demonstration.' 414 F.2d 630, 632. \\"That night, armed FBI agents cornered Danny's car and arrested him as he left his father's electronics plant. One of them bragged to Danny that he had spent the entire day trying to identify a federal crime they could charge him with . . . . [T]he statute he and Vander Smith were charged with violating--designed to preclude civilians from impersonating members of the armed forces--had an exception: an actor in a theatrical or motion picture production could wear an armed forces uniform but . . . . only if the portrayal did not discredit that branch of the military. Put another way, it was okay to wear an army uniform so long as you spoke lovingly of the army. . . . During closing argument the assistant U.S. Attorney, 'Moose' Hartman, pointed at Danny and yelled, 'If Schacht comes to my house and expresses himself like this he won't be able to walk into this courtroom to stand trial.' Then he moved toward both boys: 'The only thing I gather from these defendants is that they are displeased with the government and the war. But I have a single answer to that. There is a plane and boat [sic] leaving two or three times a day for other parts of the world. I can probably name you gentlemen the place to go. If you don't like it, get out.'\\" Run Brother Run, by David Berg (Schacht's attorney) (Scribner 2013), pp. 132-134. Smith and Schacht were indicted, tried by a jury and convicted of violating 18 U.S.C.A. ¬ß 702. U.S. District Judge James Noel sentenced Vander Smith to probation. Then, while punching holes in a piece of paper with a pencil, Noel glared at Danny and said, 'Schacht's express purpose was to discredit the United States, of this army in Vietnam, to leave the impression to all watching that the soldiers of the country were attacking innocent people who were being killed by shooting . . . In my opinion, the defendant acted heedlessly and he has not expressed the slightest bit of remorse. Noel sentence Danny to the maximum possible term under the statute: a $250 fine and six months in a federal penitentiary.' Sixteen days later, on March 15, 1968, US army lieutenant William Calley led his troops into the tiny village of Mai Lai, where they slaughtered at least 347 unarmed men, women, and children.\\" Ibid, at 134. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed Danny's and Vander Smith's convictions. Vander Smith did not seek Supreme Court review. Schacht thought his ACLU lawyers had filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court, but they had failed to do so, and soon after the expiration of the time for filing the petition, a mandate issued for his arrest. Danny surrendered to the U.S. Marshal Service just after Labor Day, 1969 and was sent to the federal penitentiary in Seagoville, Texas. A few days before, Schacht's father, also a political activist once arrested for displaying a sign in his yard supporting a black candidate for Houston's City Council, retained Berg. Berg and his lifelong friend, Stuart Nelkin, drafted a brief and filed the petition for writ 101 days late. The Supreme Court, which makes the rules, relaxed the rule setting deadlines for filing an appeal there, and, on December 15, 1969, granted certiorari, with three judges dissenting. Judge Noel, aware that the Court's decision granting cert signaled a likely reversal, released Schacht on bail pending the outcome of the appeal. On March 31, 1970, Berg, then 28, argued the case before the U.S. Supreme Court against Solicitor General and former Dean of Harvard Law School, Erwin Griswold. On May 25, 1970, the Court unanimously reversed Schacht's conviction, striking that portion of the statute prohibiting portrayals of the military in a manner that tends to discredit that branch of the armed forces as a violation of free speech. Vander Smith's conviction was vacated in later proceedings in the district court. The Schacht decision legitimized what was called \\"guerilla theater\\" and set a precedent allowing late-filed cases to proceed in SCOTUS, if warranted by the circumstances. Challenged statutes 18 U.S.C. 702 \\"Whoever, in any place within the jurisdiction of the United States or in the Canal Zone, without authority, wears the uniform or a distinctive part thereof or anything similar to a distinctive part of the uniform of any of the armed forces of the United States, Public Health Service or any auxiliary of such, shall be fined not more than $250 or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.\\". 10 U.S.C. ¬ß 772(f) \\"When wearing by persons not on active duty authorized.... :(f) While portraying a member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps, an actor in a theatrical or motion-picture production may wear the uniform of that armed force ~~if the portrayal does not tend to discredit that armed force~~.\\". Holding The Supreme Court held that 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 702 by itself was valid, i.e. that there could be a blanket ban on the wearing of military uniforms by those not in the military. However, 10 U.S.C. ¬ß 772 provided a list of exceptions, and the Court found that allowing actors to wear uniforms only if their role did not discredit the military was a violation of the actor's First Amendment right to Free Speech. This, in effect, struck the final clause of 10 U.S.C. ¬ß 772 (f).

Plot  Suzanne (Kristin Scott Thomas), is a well-to-do married woman and mother of two in the south of France. Her idle bourgeois lifestyle begins to depress her, and she decides to go back to work as a physiotherapist. Her husband, Samuel (Yvan Attal), agrees to fix up a treatment room for her in their back yard. When Suzanne meets Ivan (Sergi L√≥pez), a Spanish ex-con hired to do the building, their mutual attraction is sudden and violent. After multiple trysts with Ivan, Suzanne confesses the affair to her husband and promises to give it up, but finds she cannot. She finally decides to give up everything and live to the fullest her all- engulfing passion for Ivan, but her husband will not let go of her and her daughter rejects her, although her son stays connected to her. The new couple soon faces severe financial problems, some of them caused by Samuel: when Suzanne's credit card is rejected, she is forced to sell her Cartier watch at a gas station. In their extreme need, Suzanne and Ivan rob Samuel's house of its paintings and valuables but Ivan is arrested when he fences the stolen goods for them. Suzanne tries to convince her husband that she was solely responsible for the burglary, and that she only took what was hers. She offers to do anything to keep Ivan out of jail, and her husband tells her that, if she comes home, Ivan will be free. At this dilemma, she faints. Back in their home, Suzanne is distant with her family, yet tolerant of her husband's sexual advances. Soon, though, she takes a rifle and shells from a closet and kills Samuel as he sleeps. After driving through the night, she is eventually reunited with Ivan at the ruined house in the hills they had once dreamt of restoring. They embrace and she sobs hysterically.

It is a group of cultural animation composed of a theater company whose activities include arts, cultural travels, photographs, among other things. Although primarily located in France, the OCC has several centers in Qu√©bec and Chile. The group was widely referred to as a cult in the media, particularly after the publication of the first parliamentary report in which it was mentioned. History and organization Strongly influenced by a text of Pius XII sent to artists in 1952, then by Marthe Robin, Olivier Fenoy created and developed the OCC alongside Gr√©goire Molle. The name comes from a caf√© in the Quartier Latin, \\"Le Petit Cluny\\", where the founders organized their first meetings, and therefore has no connection with the Abbey of Cluny. In 1973, \\"the community of Cluny\\" or \\"missionaries of hope\\" was created by hundreds of people who wanted to permanently live this lifestyle. The charter accompanying the association's statutes requires to members celibacy and chastity. Postulants, novices and engaged must give their goods to the community. The first artistic creation of the group was \\"Un Caprice\\" by Alfred de Musset. Students centers were quickly created. The OCC has acutellement about ten centers throughout France (Palis, Entrevaux, Ch√¢teau de Machy, Center Le Br√ªlaire, etc...). It publishes a quarterly magazine named Le Courrier: Nouvelles de Cluny. In 1972, the Secretary of State for Youth and Sports granted to the OCC a provisional approval as organization of popular education. This approval was withdrawn in 1982, then reinstated by the State Council in 1990. Reception The OCC was listed as a cult in the 1995 and 1999 parliamentary reports and considered as a \\"pseudo-Catholic\\" and a \\"medium-sized cult\\" in terms of wealth (its annual budget reached between 5 and 20 million francs at the time). The commission accused the OCC to infiltrate the world of childhood by the formula of courses and seminars in the field of leisure but also academic support and cultural development. Anti-cult association ADFI criticized the OCC for its methods of seduction, its particular lifestyle (reduced sleep, long prayers, inability to be alone, etc.), possible families breakdowns, its hierarchical structure, psychological pressures and despoilment. Former members claimed to have been \\"seduced by promises of social advancement\\" in the group, then to have been \\"totally ruined after their stay at the centers in Claux and Le Machy\\". The OCC rules were described as \\"binding and totalitarian\\". For their part, Bishop of Troyes G√©rard Daucourt, as well as Bishops Montagrin, Pontier and Jean Vernette, criticized the classification of cult attributed to the OCC and wrote a protest letter to Philippe S√©guin, arguing that this caused some harm to the OCC as well as to the Catholic Church. For Andr√©-Hubert Mesnard, the classification made by the Parliamentary Commission was not democratic because the list could not be changed after its publication and thus the groups incriminated, including the OCC, could not defend themselves against criticisms. CESNUR stated that the group was \\"nearly bankrupted due to the refusal of public theatres to air its shows\\", after its cult designation. Judicial cases The OCC launched numerous lawsuits or was sued in many cases throughout its history. The first ones were in 1980: the OCC was sued on material issues in Digne and Aix-en-Provence. On these occasions, Fenoy's brother, former followers, parents' members, and a priest from Lyon provided negative testimonies about the association. Later, on 4 June 1998, the court of Angers, then on 4 November 1999, the Court of Appeal of Angers dismissed the OCC which said that its leaders were lay monks and therefore not under the social security regulations, and tried to challenge the tax recovery imposed by URSSAF. In a lawsuit filed by a former member in Grenoble, it was revealed that Fenoy had homosexual intercourses and that he \\"kept members in a high material and spiritual dependency\\". In 1988, the OCC filed a complaint for defamation against the President of the association \\"L'Alouette\\" for issuing a leaflet warning against cults in which the OCC was cited, but was dismissed. The General Councils of several French d√©partements, including Rh√¥ne and Aube, and the Grenoble city hall gave important subsidies, which raised much criticism.

He was drafted by the Washington Redskins in the fourth round of the 2010 NFL Draft. He played college football at LSU. Early years Riley attended Stephenson High School in Stone Mountain, Georgia, where he, besides occasionally lining up at running back and strong safety, was part of a highly talented linebacker corps with teammates Kelvin Sheppard, Marcus Ball and Jermaine Cunningham. In his junior year, he registered 96 tackles, eight sacks and five forced fumbles. As a senior, Riley recorded 131 tackles, four interceptions, two sacks, five tackles for loss, and one defensive touchdown. Regarded as a three-star recruit by Rivals.com, Riley was listed as the No. 27 outside linebackers prospect in the nation. He chose LSU over Tennessee, among others. College career In his true freshman year at LSU, Riley saw action in seven games and was credited with four tackles. As a sophomore, he played all 14 season games for the Tigers and tallied 24 tackles, including 1.5 for losses and a half quarterback sack. Riley recorded two solo tackles in the 2008 BCS National Championship Game versus Ohio State. A starter in his junior year for the Tigers, Riley ranked among the team leaders in total tackles with 60, including 7.0 for losses and 1.5 sacks. He was also credited with an interception, three pass breakups, and three quarterback hurries. Riley was named Defensive MVP of the 2008 Chick-fil-A Bowl and a finalist for the 2008 Butkus Award. Professional career Washington Redskins 2010 season Riley was selected by the Washington Redskins in the fourth round (103rd overall) of the 2010 NFL Draft. He was signed to a contract on June 18, 2010. He was inactive most of the 2010 season. He played very well during times that he was on the field, but also made costly penalties, most notably he committed a 15-yard block in the back penalty against the Minnesota Vikings, nullifying Brandon Banks' punt return touchdown that would have won the game. 2011 season In the 2011 season, Riley would have his first career start in Week 10 against the Miami Dolphins. He would continue being the starting right inside linebacker in place of Rocky McIntosh. In Week 16 against the Minnesota Vikings, Riley recorded his first career sack. Riley finished the season playing all 16 games, starting eight of them, and recording 68 combined tackles, one sack, and four pass breakups. 2012 season Riley maintained his starting position at the right inside linebacker position by the start of the 2012 season. In Week 2 against the St. Louis Rams, he recorded his first career forced fumble from wide receiver Danny Amendola, which was recovered by Josh Wilson and returned 30 yards for a touchdown. 2013 season Riley continued to start at the \\"Ted\\" inside linebacker position at the start of the 2013 season. He recorded his first career interception on Kansas City Chiefs backup quarterback Chase Daniel in a Week 14 loss. Long-time defensive captain, London Fletcher, personally supported that the Redskins re-sign Riley after the season when Riley would become a free agent. During Fletcher's retirement announcement, he announced his confidence in Riley's abilities and stated \\"But as this season has gone, I really wanted to help Perry Riley develop a little bit more. I think he‚Äôs at that point where Perry doesn‚Äôt need me anymore.

History The first mill on this site was a horse mill, De Gortmolen van Bakker Lambert (English: Baker Lambert's barley mill), which was in existence by 1500. Circa 1760, this was replaced by a smock mill. On 24 May 1889 this mill was struck by lightning and burnt down. (Click on Geschiedenis\\" to view.) The replacement mill, De Eendracht, was built by millwright G R van Wieren of Janum, for miller Doeke Turkstra. Parts from a demolished oil mill were incorporated into the new mill, as were parts from the saw mill De Haan (English: The Cockerel), which had also been demolished. Both these mills had stood in Leeuwarden. Auxiliary power was provided by a Kromhout Type ER III hot bulb diesel engine. The mill was working commercially until 1964 and was sold on 12 May 1967 to the Gemeente Oostdongeradeel for ∆í3,500. The mill was restored by millwright Christiaan Bremer of Adorp, Groningen in 1971-72. The mill is used as a tourist information office by the VVV, as well as being kept in working order. Further restoration work was undertaken in 1995. Description De Eendracht is what the Dutch describe as an \\"achtkante stellingmolen\\". It is a smock mill with a stage. The mill has a five-storey brick base. The stage is at 4th-floor level, above ground level. The smock and cap are thatched. The cap is winded by a tailpole and winch. The four Common sails, which have a span of , are carried in a cast-iron windshaft. This was made by millwrights Prins van Oranje, Den Haag in 1876. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel which has 63 cogs. This drives the wallower (34 cogs) at the top of the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft, the great spur wheel (100 cogs) drives the lantern pinion stone nuts for the millstones (25 and 27 staves) and the lantern pinion stone nuts for the pearl barley stones (21 staves). All four pairs of stones are French Burrs, those used for flour milling are diameter. The pearl barley stones are diameter. Public access De Eendracht is open Tuesday to Saturday from 10:00 - 17:00, April - October, and Saturdays only from 10:00 to 17:00 November to March.

He has been the host of several popular television shows in Sweden, including Skrotslaget, Ola 21:30, S√∂ndags√∂ppet, Riktig talkshow, Myror i brallan, Wild Kids, Glasklart, and Melodifestivalen 2004. Lindholm was the editor in chief of the popular Swedish children's magazine Kamratposten from 2006 to 2011. He currently lives in Liding√∂ with his wife and son. Career Lindholm began his television career in the mid-1990s. Up until 2003, he had hosted such television shows as Myror i brallan, Ola 21:30, Skrotslaget, Riktig talkshow, and S√∂ndags√∂ppet. In 2004, he was chosen to host that year's version of Melodifestivalen, an annual music competition and the most popular television program in Sweden. The following year, Lindholm hosted the first season of Swedish reality show Wild Kids. Described as a children's version of Survivor, the show features two groups of children competing with each other in competitions in the Swedish forest Kolm√•rden, where the contestants live together until the show is over and the winners win a trip to Africa. A second season of Wild Kids was filmed in late 2006 and aired in early 2007. The third season, also hosted by Lindholm, aired in 2009, and a fourth season is currently in production. Lindholm hosted the 2007 Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards, which was arranged at Cirkus in Stockholm.On 30 October 2007, Lindholm hosted the Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards, which was arranged at Cirkus in Stockholm. At the end of 2007, Lindholm appeared on Babben Larsson's talk show Babben & Co that aired on the national television broadcaster Sveriges Television (SVT). Prior to his appearance on that show, Lindholm had only made a few appearances on television the previous months. He therefore believes his appearance on Babben & Co was the reason he was selected to host the game-show Glasklart, a newly created television project by SVT that began airing in March 2008. Glasklart was the first game-show Lindholm had hosted in his career. The program, which features charades, was described by Lindholm as an \\"hour of warm and exciting entertainment\\" mixed with knowledge and craziness. Since 2006, Lindholm has been the editor in chief of the popular Swedish children's magazine Kamratposten. The previous editor in chief was Eva Birmann. It was announced on 30 May 2006 that Lindholm would take over the magazine on 1 October that year. He considered Kamratposten to be a \\"classic institution\\" and it was not hard for him to accept the offer. Prior to joining the magazine, Lindholm had experienced working with children on the reality show Wild Kids and the children's nature show Myror i brallan, both of which aired on SVT. He commented that he easily connects with children because he treats them like adults and respects their opinions. Personal life Lindholm was raised in Karlshamn, Blekinge County. He currently lives in Liding√∂ outside of Stockholm with his wife Lotta B√§cker and their son Loa Lindholm. Lindholm quit his job as editor in chief for Kamratposten in May 2011 after being charged for the use of cocaine. Lindholm hosted the SVT program Tittarnas Wild Kids (Viewers' Wild Kids), a Wild Kids spin-off program which was mid-season at the time. Because of his prosecution, SVT pulled the remaining two episodes of the season from their schedule. Lindholm has denied the allegations. A random police test after a football game at R√•sunda showed trace amounts of benzoylecgonine in his urine. The trial began on 5 September the same year. He was found guilty on 12 September and sentenced against his denials to pay a fine.

Originally touted as a minority-owned dealership and part of the only new-car facility in Harlem, it was abandoned by its original operator within months and was taken over by General Motors directly. On June 1, 2009, it was used as the lead company in the General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization filing in New York. The Harlem Auto Mall opened in February 2006 but had its ceremonial opening on June 2, 2006. Located between 2nd and 3rd Avenues at 127th Street in East Harlem, it was the largest dealership complex in Manhattan, the only new-vehicle dealerships north of 57th Street, and the first new-vehicle dealerships in Harlem in 40 years. Run by Otis Thornton, a black man and Buick dealer in East Brunswick, New Jersey, the Chevy and Saturn dealership in the Mall received attention for being a large, new minority-owned business: the opening was attended by Jesse Jackson, New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, General Motors chairman and CEO Rick Wagoner, New York City Economic Development Corporation president Andrew Alper, and New York City Department of Transportation commissioner Iris Weinshall. The dealership was funded with $60,000,000 in private investment and $17,000,000 in tax-exempt empowerment zone bonds from the NYCEDC's New York City Industrial Development Agency, used city-owned land leased through the adjacent car dealer in the Harlem Auto Mall, and was advertised by the city government as \\"bringing 150 new jobs to Harlem to date with expected growth up to 200 jobs\\". However, Otis Thornton quit in December 2006, and General Motors took direct control of the company, planning to maintain it until another owner could be found. On June 1, 2009, Chevrolet-Saturn of Harlem was the first GM company to file Chapter 11 bankruptcy, in order for the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York to obtain jurisdiction over the entire General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization. General Motors Corporation and its other subsidiaries filed in the same court moments later. The same morning, despite the filings, a man at the dealership told the media he was the dealership's \\"owner\\" but refused to identify himself or comment on the bankruptcy. General Motors closed the dealership in January 2011.

Notable Installations  Maryhill Double Built directly across from the Maryhill Museum on the plateaus that overlook the Columbia River Gorge, Maryhill Double was a temporary installation/building that duplicated the exact interior volume of the museum that it mirrored. Standing from July 5, 2006 through October 1, 2006 and constructed solely from scaffolding and blue construction netting, Maryhill Double re-framed not only the unusual history of the Maryhill Museum, but also the significance of constructing architecture within unadulterated landscapes. Critics have noted that \\"The museum and its ghost-like Double work as a paired form, operating...to emphasize the scale of their plateau site...and to dramatize the role of human effort and desire to engage nature or subdue it...\\"Sangster, Gary (2007). \\"Double or Nothing: A Translucent Reflection Takes Shape\\", p.1. Creative Capital, New York. Ironically enough, during its lifespan the Double was classified as a \\"billboard\\" for zoning and legal purposes.Gragg, Randy (2006). \\"'Maryhill Double' shimmers, mirage-like, in gorge\\", The Oregonian, 2006-08-06.

In areas where the narrow sections overlapped atop one another, the furniture, finishes and architecture appeared to cross pollinate. Material for the installation was gathered entirely from retail liquidation sales which occurred in early 2009 within a few blocks of the project. Uniting the project linearly was a brightly lit white section complete with empty shelving, dropped ceiling, shopping carts, surveillance cameras, signage, baskets, pedestals and mannequins.

The piece, on display at the Weatherspoon Art Museum at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro from January 17 to April 13, 2008, reconstitutes the entirety of a woman‚Äôs possessions rendered homogenous with gray acrylic paint. Paperwork, books, CDs, collectible treasures, furniture and electronic devices lost their biographical specificity and appeared as anonymous shapes. Unpainted items included piles of clothing and shoes, left as an homage reference to the originating inhabitant. The site-specific installation intended to explore the nesting and spatial consequences of human dwelling. The living room was selected from a pool of volunteers through a museum advertisement searching for respondents who occupy small living spaces.Graves, Jen. (2008) \\"Gray Area: Why Does Some Work by Lead Pencil Studio Look So Much Like Work by Other Artists?\\", p. 2. The Stranger, Seattle. 2008-02-14. Some inspirations for the piece include Margaret Roberts and lidar surveying technology. After A two part installation at the Boise Art Museum from November 8, 2008 to May 3, 2009, After is an exploration of the modern forces that create and construct space‚Äîarchitecturally, visually, and conceptually. The project was composed of two large constructions individually titled, After: Billboard, and After: Dwelling. \\"After: Billboard\\" features a roped off pile of rubble with a sign surface made entirely of layered paper and real estate advertisements, capped with a window-like opening that exposes the crisscrossing two-by-fours that are the superstructure. Vaguely discernible real estate slogans and window details of this exterior piece were intended to reference the house-sized construction on the interior of the museum. \\"After: Dwelling\\" was composed of a landscape of gravel approximately 25 ft x 50 ft with a sharply defined rectilinear impression suggesting a building foundation. Floating above this field were corners of a house made entirely from architectural foam board and skim coated cement. Taken together the individual pieces describe the perimeter of a house in the uncertain state of construction or demolition and featuring several design clich√©s identified with an anonymous modern architecture. \\"The Boise Weekly\\" noted that \\"...The billboard promises, 'Your Own Piece of Blue Sky!' The wall text tells us the artists are exploring the complex systems involved in the production of space. In other words, advertising dominates the view.\\" Pettinger, E.J.

Oregon State Hospital Memorial This installation utilizes the defunct crematorium at the Oregon State Hospital as a vessel for housing the unclaimed remains of over 3,500 wards of the Oregon State Hospital in Salem, Oregon. The building was originally constructed in 1896 for use as a \\"pestilence house,\\" and later converted to the hospital's morgue. The copper containers in which the remains were contained are now in a state of severe oxidization. The artists used this as a powerful visual metaphor for the lives of those who lived out their lives in this institution. The actual remains were transferred to ceramic containers, which now occupy a perforated columbarium wall. The ceramic urns are inscribed with names, dates of birth, and dates of death of each individual, and families may choose to reclaim the remains or leave them to rest at the memorial site.

Biography  He is the son of Guszt√°v Szel√©nyi, an entomologist and Julianna Csap√≥. Szel√©nyi studied at the External Trade Faculty of the Karl Marx University of Economics in Budapest, where he graduated in 1960. After graduating, he was employed at the Hungarian Central Statistical Office. He received a Ford Scholarship and studied at the University of California in Berkeley for one year. After his return he was a research fellow at the Institute of Sociology at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (HAS). In 1967, he was elevated as scientific secretary and in 1970 as the Head of the Department of Regional Sociology. In 1973, he earned the title Candidate of Sciences (PhD) at the HAS. In 1974, a transcript of a book which he wrote with fellow sociologist and author Gy√∂rgy Konr√°d, titled The Intellectuals on the Road to Class Power, was brought out of Hungary. The book contained critical thought about Communist-ruled society. After this move, Szel√©nyi was arrested, later expelled from Hungary and stripped of his citizenship. In 1975, he was a Visiting Research Professor at the University of Kent. One year later he was invited to Flinders University of South Australia where he was the Foundation Professor of Sociology and Chair of the Department until 1980. In 1981, he joined the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, where he was Professor of Sociology for five years (the last year as the Karl Polanyi Professor). After that he was appointed Distinguished Professor of Sociology, Director of the Center for Social Research and Executive Officer of the Sociology Program at the Graduate School of the City University of New York. From 1988 to 1999 he worked as Professor of Sociology at UCLA (between 1992 and 1995 as department chair). In 1999, he was appointed William Graham Sumner Professor of Sociology and Professor of Political Science at the Yale University. He chaired the department two times (1999‚Äì2002 and 2008‚Äì2009). In 2010, he became the Dean of Social Sciences at New York University Abu Dhabi, where he continues to teach today. After the political change in Hungary, his citizenship was reinstated. Since 1990, he has held a Doctor of Science degree and became a corresponding member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He was elected to full membership in 1995. In 2006, he received the highest state prize for scientific work, the Sz√©chenyi Prize, and two years later he became an Honorary Citizen of Budapest. Beyond that, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2000. He is the father of three children: his elder daughter, Szonja Szel√©nyi (now Ivester), teaches sociology at University of California, Berkeley, his younger daughter Lilla Szel√©nyi is on the State of California Workers‚Äô Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB) in Oakland, California and his son Bal√°zs teaches history at Northeastern University.  Works  At the beginning of his scientific work, his research focused on urban communities. He wrote numerous publications on that issue, mostly in Hungarian. His critical stance on partyline issues was published in his book The Intellectuals on the Road to Class Power, which was published in English in 1979. It was also translated into German, French, Spanish and Japanese. After he was forced to leave Hungary, his research profile changed. He studied the inequality in urban communities and about the structural problems of the capitalistic and socialistic society. His most important publications of these are Urban Inequalities under State Socialism (1983), Socialist Entrepreneurs. Embourgeoisement in Rural Hungary (1988), Social Conflicts of Post-communist Transitions (1992) and Making Capitalism without Capitalists (1998).

The program is produced by WIN Television and airs five days a week on the WIN Network.  History  In 2007, WIN Television announced a new cooking show to replace Fresh with the Australian Women's Weekly, a similar show provided by the Nine Network. At the time, WIN were in the middle of intense negotiations with Nine, which resulted in the removal of some Nine-produced programs from the schedule. Alive and Cooking aired its first episode on Monday 2 June 2008 at 11.30am on most of WIN's regional stations. It remained in that time slot for the duration of the entire first season. In 2009, the Nine Network axed Fresh with the Australian Women's Weekly and replaced it with Alive and Cooking. In late 2009, the Nine Network expanded Nine Morning News to one hour as part of an expansion of Nine News content across their daytime schedule which resulted in Alive and Cooking being dropped from the Nine daytime schedule. WIN, Nine Adelaide and Nine Perth (both owned by WIN), and NBN Television moved the show to 3pm weekdays. In July 2010, WIN & NBN moved the show back to its original 11:30am weekday timeslot in place of Nine Morning News. Nine restarted showing the program again from 24 September 2010 with the launch of their new digital sub-channel 9Gem.  Availability  Alive and Cooking is broadcast across Australia on GEM. The program has not aired on WIN since 30 June 2016 due to becoming a Channel Ten show. The show returned later that year, airing at 2:30pm as it was previously. From 31 July 2017, the 8th season will be broadcast at 3.30pm weekdays on Network Ten, with 70 episodes to be screened until early November. Merchandise Some \\"Food For All Seasons\\" DVDs have been released, plus a number of cooking books featuring recipes from the show.  James Reeson  James Reeson is a British celebrity chef who is famous in Australia. He is renowned for his television cooking shows James Can Cook and The Occasional Cook. He was also a chef in various hotels and on cruise ships around Europe and the Mediterranean. He first travelled to Australia to indulge his love of longboard surfing in Victoria, then began a catering enterprise. When a friend undertaking media studies needed a subject for a course project, James agreed and this led to him coming to the attention of a producer then at the ABC. After several series each of shorts and episodes on that network, James was commissioned by WIN to host Alive and Cooking.

In China, CGN operates nuclear plants at Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant, Ling Ao Nuclear Power Plant, Hongyanhe Nuclear Power Plant and Ningde Nuclear Power Plant, with five new nuclear power stations under construction and another two planned. CGN operates in other emerging energy industries like wind energy and solar energy, as well as more traditional industries like hydroelectricity. CGN operates power generation plant of the following capacities: nuclear 8.3 GW, wind 4.7 GW, hydro 4.0 GW and solar 600 MW. CGN has been sanctioned by the United States for attempting to acquire advanced U.S. nuclear technology to divert to military uses in China. CGN's proposals to operate two nuclear plants in the UK have received criticism from MPs as a potential threat to national security. History China Guangdong Nuclear Power Holding Co., Ltd. (CGNPC) was established in September 1994 with a registered capital of RMB 10.2 billion with nuclear power as its core business. With CGNPC as its core enterprise, China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group (CGNPG) comprises more than twenty wholly owned or controlling subsidiaries. In April 2009, a fund run by China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group signed a deal raising US$1.03 billion for nuclear and related energy projects. Guangdong Nuclear's fund, the first industrial fund set up by a state-owned enterprise with approval from the State Council signed the fund-raising agreement with Bank of China, China Development Bank and other institutions, which will become shareholders in the fund. The financing is the first of two phases for the fund, which plans to raise a total of 10 billion yuan. In May 2013, the organization changed its name to China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN) to signify that its operations extend beyond Guangdong province. In December 2014, CGN raised $3 billion by an initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong. In December 2014, the firm announced it was acquiring three wind farms in the UK with a combined capacity of 73 megawatts from British energy company EDF Energy for a fee estimated to be in the region of ¬£100 million. In November 2015, the company and its subsidiaries agreed to acquire 1Malaysia Development Berhad's energy assets, worth around $2.3 billion. The transaction was part of the wider 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal which resulted in billions of dollars being stolen from the Government of Malaysia and the arrest of Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak for corruption and fraud Nuclear espionage In 2016, the US Justice Department charged CGN with stealing nuclear secrets from the United States. The Guardian reported: \\"According to the US Department of Justice, the FBI has discovered evidence that China General Nuclear Power (CGN) has been engaged in a conspiracy to steal US nuclear secrets stretching back almost two decades. Both CGN and one of the corporation‚Äôs senior advisers, Szuhsiung Ho, have been charged with conspiring to help the Chinese government develop nuclear material in a manner that is in clear breach of US law.\\" In August 2019, the U.S. Department of Commerce added CGN to its \\"entity list\\", barring U.S. companies from selling products to CGN. In its reasoning, the United States Department of Commerce explained that CGN attempted to acquire advanced U.S. nuclear technology to divert to military uses in China\\". Under China's 2017 National Intelligence Law, Chinese citizens and organisations are require to cooperate with Chinese state intelligence organisations. The Chinese state-owned China Daily claimed, without evidence, that \\"The real aim is to try to thwart the country‚Äôs 'Made in China 2025' and was part of the US-China trade war\\". Technology import and development CGN's first nuclear station uses reactors designed and built by the French National Company, Framatome. Then it developed an improved PWR (pressurized water reactor) called CPR-1000 based on the French type. CPR-1000 is a fully Chinese designed and constructed reactor type which takes a large proportion in all the reactors being built in China. This has been developed into the Generation III Hualong One design. In February 2007, CGN signed a contract with Areva to build Taishan nuclear station with Areva's EPR, and the Xianning nuclear station will use Westinghouse Electric Company's AP1000. These two events makes this company among the first to build a nuclear station with generation III+ reactors.

Robertson and Andrew Senna in Seattle, Washington in 2006.The Score by Christopher DeLaurenti Mostly regarded as an outlet for digital releases of experimental and ambient musicm, Aphonia also has released more pop oriented artists such as Desolation Wilderness and Slim Twig. Both signed with major labels.Evergreen Alumni Magazine  Formation  Robertson and Senna both grew up in Spokane, Washington, and met in high school and soon after began playing music together. Although their collaborations remained intermittent through their teenage years, they would later find themselves both studying experimental music composition at The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington. They received school credit for organizing and promoting a showcase of experimental works at Evergreen, citing this experience as one that led them to produce shows and promote artists in the future.  Business model  Senna and Robertson used a business model capitalizing on the low overhead associated with digital only releases. According to the label's website, by designing their own website from which music fans could purchase digital only releases they became one of the first labels to offer a truly independent online store with no DRM copy protection.VFS Blog Mp3 FridayAphonia Recordings site While most of their catalog is available in digital only format on their website, the iTunes Music Store and Amazon, they also have limited physical releases, usually hand made by the artists themselves in very limited runs. The label only signs their artists to single release deals preferring to allow their artists freedom to release on other labels. In addition, operating their own online store front makes the percentage of profit from the retail price unusually high, especially for a label releasing esoteric and niche market music. Both have expressed their desire to cut down on what they see as waste byproducts of the music industry, i.e. plastic for CDs, plastic jewel cases, fuel for transportation and distribution.  Showcases and festivals  Through organizing live performances for their artist's the label continues not only to distribute music but provide a venue for it as well. Not long after its formation, Aphonia Recordings became an organizational member of Gallery 1412, Gallery 1412 a non-profit corporation operating in Seattle's Central District. The label, as a member of the organization, held well over 20 showcases, benefits and shows at the venue. The label has made live recordings of the shows available through a podcast, mainly created and written by Senna. However, this limited format has given way to more substantive explorations of particular artists through narrative storytelling and interpretive analysis of the artist's work. The label is also a supporter and sponsor of many Pacific Northwest experimental and fringe festivals including the Olympia Experimental Music Festival in Olympia, Washington, the Occultural Music Festival The Stranger and most recently the Carousel Festival, both based in Seattle, Washington. Many on the labels roster of artists perform at these festivals.  Attention in the press  While steadily releasing music since its inception a great deal of press attention has been paid on the young label. Both of Seattle's weekly independent newspapers The Stranger (newspaper) and the Seattle WeeklySeattle Weekly Aja Pecknold regularly cover and review the labels showcases and festival sponsorship efforts. In addition to interest by the alternative press in Seattle, the label also enjoys regular listings in regional news outlets, such as the Tacoma News Tribune.Tacoma News Tribune As alumni of Evergreen State College, Robertson and Senna were profiled in the Spring 2009 Evergreen magazine.

CFU provides municipal water service, electricity generation and distribution, natural gas service, and combined cable television, Internet access, and phone service to its customers. CFU serves approximately 19,000 Cedar Falls residents and businesses with over 14,900 broadband customers. History Founding to 1919 The 1880s Cedar Falls Utilities began as a municipally owned waterworks in 1888 which supplied spring water to residents and businesses. The waterworks received incredible praise for its water and nearly \\"legendary state of purity\\". The 1890s In the late 1890s, a franchise was granted to a company based in Waterloo, Iowa (Citizens Gas and Electric Company) for electric production which powered street and house lighting for 15 years. Due to this existing franchise - despite public interest in developing a community-owned electric company, and hoping to avoid a monopoly situation - focus was placed on creating a community-owned gas plant. A short franchise was granted to George A. Dunkle of Chicago to provide a gas plant and distribution system, but was quickly disbanded after a fatal accident caused by the lighted match of an employee. 25-year franchise rights were then granted to Citizens Gas and Electric Company in Waterloo for gas production and distribution in Cedar Falls. The 1910s In the early 1910s, ordinary citizens and industrial leaders alike began taking note of the city's poor street lighting. In a special election on March 13, 1913 Cedar Falls residents voted in favor of a bond to construct a municipally owned power plant and distribution system. On April 1, 1914, generation started at the plant and the first customers were served. Shortly after production began, in June 1914, the community-owned electric company signed an agreement with the Iowa State Teachers College (now the University of Northern Iowa) to supply electricity to the campus. 1920 to 1959 The 1920s After pushes to raise gas prices from the Citizens Gas and Electric company, as well as a fatal gas explosion killing a Cedar Falls family, public enthusiasm for a municipally owned gas utility steadily increased over the course of the 1920s. An engineering consulting firm was hired from Kansas City to investigate the gas situation in Cedar Falls, by whom recommendations were made to establish a community-owned gas manufacturing and distribution system. During this time, the public waterworks and electric distribution systems continued to operate smoothly. In 1926, the original cost of the power plant was paid off, about 12 years after it was established. Then, in March, 1928, a vote was held and passed by a 5-1/2 to 1 margin to construct a municipal gas utility. The 1930s In 1936, demand for electricity threatened to exceed the municipal utility's means to produce it. Enthusiasts called for a hydroelectric power plant to be built on the Cedar River, claiming that hydroelectric power is \\"almost free for the asking.\\" However, due to drought and extremely low water levels in recent years, the utility opted to construct a 2,500 kilowatt steam turbine at the power plant instead. Construction of the turbine was completed in 1937. In the late 1930s, due to damage of the swimming beach on the Cedar River, the utility company transformed the artificial lake at their power plant into a public swimming pool. Expenses for maintenance of the lake and grounds, construction of bath houses and fences, and maintenance of a safety boat were charged to the lighting fund. Promotion, staff, water treatment, and classes were charged to a city recreation fund. The 1940s In 1939, surveys began for adapting a recently rebuilt dam on the Cedar River with a hydroelectric plant. A site was chosen a quarter-mile downstream from the dam, and a 1,200 kilowatt hydroelectric plant went into service on February 1, 1941. During the first full year of service, due to unusually high water levels on the Cedar River, the hydroelectric plant produced about 60 percent of the city's electric needs, a mark not to be reached again during the lifetime of the plant. The year 1945, with the end of World War II, marked the beginning of a steady increase in demand for all utility services. The G.I. Bill of Rights brought an unprecedented number of young men to Cedar Falls for college and to start new lives with their families. During this time, old water and electric production equipment, as well as the employees who maintained them, began to show their age. The equipment could not keep up with demand, and workers who had known the operation of this equipment from the beginning were starting to retire. Plans were made for plant upgrades at the municipal utilities, specifically for electric production equipment and water well pumps which had grown obsolete. In the late 1940s, to keep up with \\"the fastest growing city in Iowa\\" and their utility needs, a Board of Trustees appointed by the mayor to oversee company operation was considered. The 1950s The 1950s were a period of great expansion for Cedar Falls and the utility company necessarily expanded with it. Natural gas distribution began in the mid 50s. In 1956, nearly 6.1 million gallons of water were pumped to citizens and businesses of Cedar Falls. A 5,000 kilowatt turbine-generator, completed in 1955, was constructed to meet growing electric demands, only to be met with further increased demand in 1956 when a 10,000 kilowatt interchange agreement was made with the Iowa Public Service Company. In 1959, further expansion of the city's electrical distribution system was needed. Plans were also made for an extensive street lighting program to improve the quality of street lights throughout Cedar Falls. That year, 94.2% of energy was generated at the Utility's power plant, 5.47% was produced by the hydroelectric plant, and about 0.25% was purchased from the Iowa Public Service Company. 1960 to 1999 The 1960s Now supporting a population nearly 7,000 greater than a decade before, the electric and gas departments continued their rapid expansion during the 1960s. A new office building was completed in March 1960 for the Gas, Water, and Electric department's office workers which included a 4,500 square foot community room and commonly hosted meetings for the Cedar Falls City Council, United Appeal, Girl Scouts, Red Cross, and local churches. Cedar Falls Municipal Utilities was one of three fallout shelter sites in Cedar Falls during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Black Hawk County Civil Defense stocked the shelter with food, medical, and sanitation supplies. The newly appointed Board of Trustees's first major concern was the need for expanded access to electric service. Proposals for a 16,500 kilowatt steam turbine-generator were made in late 1960 and construction began in March 1962. When completed, the new power plant addition was the tallest structure in Cedar Falls. A new Gas Distribution facility went into service in late 1963 and by 1965 80 percent of homes in Cedar Falls were heated with natural gas. In 1966 the modern CFU logo was first used. That same year, two and a half miles of water main was laid helping supply over 780 million gallons of water to the people of Cedar Falls. In 1968, a massive 25,000 kilowatt combustion engine - the largest in Iowa at the time - was constructed in Cedar Falls. During the summer of 1969, the community swimming pool was filled in to provide additional coal storage. General Managers 1958-2018 In March, 1958, John P. Pace, a graduate of the University of New Mexico with a degree in electrical engineering, was hired as the Utility's first CEO. A special election in August that same year transferred control of the Utilities from the city council to a Board of Trustees appointed by the mayor of Cedar Falls. The first Board of Trustees took office on September 1, 1959. Economic Development The Municipal Communications Utility is community-owned but not tax supported. A group of local citizens forms a Board of Trustees who set rates for all CFU services. The fees for these services completely cover the Utility, there is no cost to the public. CFU participates in municipal efforts to promote economic development, which in turn results in a larger customer base for its utility services. CFU continuously expands and improves its service to meet community needs. Due to customer demand, particularly from local businesses, the municipal utility launched phone service in May 2016. The utility donated land to form the Cedar Falls Industrial and Technology Park in the late 1960s and in more recent years has aggressively expanded access to its communications services, including cable television, phone, and broadband Internet access, which the city promotes as a key factor in its economic-development strategy. The communications utility began service in 1996 after a 1994 community referendum with over 70% voter approval. CFU offers a variety of communications services from budget to premium, meeting a wide range of customer needs and further expanding community development. As a whole, CFU subscribers save more that $4 million a year on communications services, compared with the average peer-city rates. Telecommunications Cedar Falls Utilities is very innovative in its use of FTTx network, providing high speed internet, phone, and video services. CFU peers with the three most highly connected networks in the world - Level 3 Communications, Cogent Communications, and Hurricane Electric. They are connected via one-hop fiber paths through Chicago, Kansas City, and Des Moines. Renewable Energy From 2008 to 2016, use of coal powered electric generation has decreased in CFU's plants by 33%. The significant reduction in use of fossil fuels is a result of the use of solar and wind power by the company. Over the past thirty years, CFU's energy efficiency programs have included local building energy codes, on-bill financing, sizing of A/C unites under a rebate program, and smart thermostat pilot programs. CFU was also one of the first utility sponsors of the Energy Star Verified Installation program. Wind Energy CFU was an early entrant into the market for renewable energy in the United States, investing in a wind-energy project in 1998 along with six other Iowa municipal utilities. In 2016, 28% of electricity supplied to Cedar Falls was wind generated, up from 2% in 2006. Solar Energy When energy generation started in April 2016 at CFU's solar farm, it was the largest community solar project in Iowa with over 1,200 participating residents and businesses. Eight acres of land near Prairie Lakes Park was donated by the city of Cedar Falls for the project. The total capacity of the solar array is 1.5 MW. Awards and Recognition Water *The Iowa Section of the American Water Works Association (AWWA) voted CFU the winner of the 2013 Water Tasting Testing Competition for Best Tasting Water in Iowa at the IA-AWWA Annual Conference. Electric *In 2011, CFU received the Award of Continued Excellence (ACE) from the American Public Power Association for sustained commitment to energy innovation and support of research and development projects aimed at improving energy efficiency and promoting renewable resources. *CFU received two awards from the American Public Power Association in 2016. CFU was designated a Diamond level Reliable Public Power Provider with 99.996% electric reliability and a 17-minute average outage duration. CFU also received the E.F. Scattergood System Achievement award in 2016 for sustained performance that is widely recognized in the public power field. Telecommunications *In 2013, Cedar Falls - with the help of CFU - was Iowa's first \\"Gigabit City\\", delivering speeds of up to one gigabit per second to its customers. *In October 2014, Google named Cedar Falls Iowa's top e-commerce city. *On January 14, 2015 - in his first visit to Iowa since his 2012 re-election campaign - President Barack Obama recognized Cedar Falls and the municipal utility as a small community that can compete with private businesses to provide world- class internet access to customers. The President praised CFU for being a small community with broadband internet 100 times faster than the national average. President Obama also pointed out the benefits of having competition in the telecommunications industry to keep prices low and service level high. That same day, Mediacom - a privately owned telecommunications company in the Midwest - released a statement voicing their deep concern about President Obama's comments on CFU. *In 2017, Calix - a telecommunications company focused on cloud products and access networks - presented the utility with the Calix Innovation Award: Innovation in AXOS Subscriber Management for demonstrating \\"outstanding creativity when leveraging Calix technology to deploy best-in-class services.\\" Safety *In 2011, The Iowa-Illinois Safety Council Chapter of National Safety Council recognized CFU for \\"Incident Rate Excellence\\". *In 2012, CFU received the Midwest Energy Association (MEA) Accident Prevention Award in recognition of an outstanding 2011 safety record. *On July 20, 2013, Iowa Council 61 of The American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) recognized CFU as a member of AFSCME who in the course of their work duties became aware of an emergency situation and acted quickly, calmly, and professionally and as a result, saved a life. Employer of Choice The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier is a local newspaper which annually recognizes employers in the Cedar Valley for excellence in promoting employee quality of life. CFU has been nominated by employees and recognized by the Courier many times in the past decade: *September 2011 - Cedar Falls Utilities was nominated as an Employer of Choice by its employees for \\"creating a culture where employees feel valued and appreciated.\\" *September 2012 - Cedar Falls Utilities was nominated as an Employer of Choice by its employees for outstanding health benefits. *August 2014 - Cedar Falls Utilities was nominated as an Employer of Choice by its employees for \\"exceeding customer expectations and the expectations of its workforce.\\" *August 2015 - Cedar Falls Utilities was nominated as an Employer of Choice by its employees for \\"putting emphasis on customer satisfaction, employee enthusiasm, and fiscal responsibility.\\" *September 2017 - Cedar Falls Utilities was nominated as an Employer of Choice by its employees for their flexibility and promoting a family-friendly atmosphere.

According to the Nihon Shoki, in 1654 two men and two women of the Tushara Kingdom, along with one woman from Shravasti, were driven by a storm to take refuge at the former Hy≈´ga Province in southern Kyushu. They remained for several years before setting off for home. The history of modern Indian settlement in Japan goes back more than a century. As early as 1873, a few Indian businessmen and their families, primarily Parsis and Sindhis, had settled Yokohama as well as Okinawa. In 1891, Tata, then a small trading firm, established a branch in Kobe. By 1901, Japanese government statistics recorded 30 people from British India living in Japan. Local statistics of the Hy≈çgo Prefecture government showed 59 Indians living in the prefecture in 1905, among whom all but one were men. After the destruction wreaked on Yokohama in the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake, the Indian traders there also migrated to Kobe; from then on, Kobe became the centre of gravity of Japan's Indian community. By 1939, on the eve of World War II, the number of Indians in Hy≈çgo Prefecture had reached 632. However, due to British sanctions against Japan and the 1941 halt of shipping between Japan and their homeland, many closed their shops and left; by 1942, there were only 114 remaining. Three years after the Partition of India, their numbers had recovered somewhat to 255. Prior to 1990, the Indian community in Japan remained centred on the Kobe area. However, after 1990, the numbers in Tokyo began to show a sharp increase. Migrants who arrived in the 1990s included industrial trainees sent by Japanese car manufacturers which had set up factories in India. IT professionals and their families also came to Tokyo, settling primarily in Setagaya and Minato wards. Business and employment An Indian restaurant in Tokyo , there were also around 800 Indians working in the IT industry in Japan, up from 120 in 1993. Kenichi Yoshida, a director of the Softbridge Solutions Japan Co., stated in late 2009 that the Indian engineers are becoming the backbone of Japan's IT industry and that \\"it is important for Japanese industry to work together with the India.\\" Another 870 Indians were employed as cooks. Others are engaged in trading, importing the Indian handicrafts, garments, precious stones, and marine products, and exporting Japanese electronic goods, textiles, automotive parts, and jewellery. Religion Indians in Japan speak a number of different languages and follow various religions; there is little correlation between religion or language and profession, except in the case of the Jains, many of whom work in the jewellery industry. The Jains are generally concentrated around Okachi- machi in Tait≈ç, Tokyo. On the whole, Tokyo has fewer religious facilities for Indians than Kobe. There are Sikh gurudwaras in both Kobe and Tokyo; the latter is of more recent provenance, having been founded in 1999 in the basement of an office building. Some Sikhs employed as unskilled labourers in small and medium enterprises had to cut their hair short and remove their turbans in violation of the principle of kesh, because their employers are unfamiliar with their customs and do not give them any latitude in their style of dress. They consider this as just a temporary adaptation to Japanese society. However, this practise is not common among Sikhs in skilled professions such as IT. There has been a recent migration of Marathi Buddhist community in Japan. The community came to Japan in search of jobs and is now also emerging as a business community. These people speak Marathi at home and Japanese at work. These people are originally followers of Navayana Buddhism and have now started syncretising with Japanese Buddhism. Education India International School in Japan, Tokyo Global Indian International School, Tokyo Campus Indians who send their children to school in Japan generally select English-medium schools. The first Indian-specific school was established in 2004 in Tokyo's Koto ward at the initiative of some of the old trading families based in Tokyo and Yokohama. The school's name is IISJ which stands for India International School in Japan. The Global Indian International School, a Singapore-based school, has operated a branch in Tokyo since 2006, and plans to open another in Yokohama in 2008. They follow the Indian Central Board of Secondary Education curriculum. The schools are popular not just among Indian expatriates, but among some Japanese as well, due to a reputation for rigour in mathematics education. Other migrants leave their children behind in their native states, either with grandparents or at the boarding schools, in order to avoid interrupting their education. Jeevarani \\"Rani Sanku\\" Angelina,\\"History .\\" Little Angels International School. Retrieved on 9 March 2015. established the Little Angels International School, which caters to Japanese students. Community organizations One of the earliest Indian community organisations, the Oriental Club, was established in 1904 in Kobe; it changed its name to The India Club in 1913, and continued operating up to the present day. More were founded in the 1930s, including the Indian- dominated Silk Merchants' Association, the Indian Social Society, and the Indian Chamber of Commerce. In 2000, Indian expatriates living in Edogawa, Tokyo, an area with a high concentration of Indian IT engineers founded the Indian Community of Edogawa. Others include the Indian Community Activities Tokyo, whose Diwali celebration draws 2,500 participants, as well as the Indian Merchants Association of Yokohama. Japan Tamil Sangam is the registered community organization in Japan. It is the biggest community organizations for uniting Tamil speakers with more than 4000 members. The Tamilar Thirunal Pongal festival, Food and sports festival Vanakkam Thamizhagam draws large crowds in Edogawa Tokyo every year.

The estate is located on the banks of the Alster River in the middle of the Alster valley (Alstertal) nature reserve. History Wellingsb√ºttel Manor, gatehouse by Georg Greggenhofer (1757) Deed of enfeoffment of Friedrich Karl Ludwig, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck with Wellingsb√ºttel Manor by Frederick VI of Denmark (1810); now on display in the Alstertal Museum in the manor gatehouse Wellingsb√ºttelRegarding the derivation of the suffix \\"-b√ºttel\\" and the early forms of \\"Wellingsb√ºttel\\" see: J√ºrgen Udolph, Namenkundliche Studien zum Germanenproblem, Volume 9 of Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde - Ergaenzungsbaende Series, 1994, 427 was first mentioned in 1296.There is another, less important, manor also named Wellingsb√ºttel not so far away in the region of Otterndorf, owned by the von Klenck family, which should not be confused with this one. See: Chronik des Landes Hadeln: nebst interessanten Ausz√ºgen aus der Geschichte der Aemter Ritzeb√ºttel, Bederkesa und Neuhaus, des Landes Wursten und des Landes Kehdingen: mit einem Titelkpf. u. einer Charte, 1843, p. 19; Lenz, Martin, Das Patrimonialgericht Wellingsb√ºttel und das Teilgericht D√∂rringworth, 1963 In 1412 Wellingsb√ºttel became the property of the archbishops of Bremen.Rackowitz p. 26 In the 16th century the first Lusthausliterally \\"pleasure-house\\", i.e., an unfortified country house used for recreation rather than permanent residence was built on the site.Rackowitz p.30 In 1643 it became a fiefdom of the chancellor of the last archbishop, Dietrich Reinking. After the Peace of Westphalia (1648) Wellingsb√ºttel came to Sweden but remained in the possession of Reinking, as confirmed in 1649 by Christina of Sweden. Reinking was a count palatine and claimed imperial immediacy for Wellingsb√ºttel, which lasted until 1806. In 1673 Baron (Freiherr) Theobald von Kurtzrock acquired the property.Fiege, Geschichte, p. 27 A Roman Catholic, he was imperial privy councillor (Kaiserlicher Reichshofrat), imperial ambassador to Lower Saxony (residierender k. k. Minister am Nieders√§chsischen Kreis) and master of postal services for the Thurn-und-Taxis-Post (Thurn- und Taxischer Postmeister). Theobald Joseph von Kurtzrock erected the present manor house (Herrenhaus) in 1750 next to the Alster River.Fiege, Geschichte, p. 34 In 1757 Georg Greggenhofer designed the gatehouse.Fiege, Geschichte, p. 38 In 1806 Wellingsb√ºttel was occupied by Danish troops and Clemens August von Kurtzrock was forced to sell it to Frederick VI of Denmark, when the king picked a quarrel over his alleged right to levy a toll on everyone crossing over the lands of the estate, which was at that time encircled by Danish territory.Fiege, Geschichte, p. 58‚Äì63 In 1810 the king enfeoffed his relative General Friedrich Karl Ludwig, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck, with Wellingsb√ºttel, which he elevated to a \\"chancellery manor\\" (Kanzleigut), that is, a manor directly subordinated to the royal chancellery at Copenhagen and permitted to operate its own manor court. At the same time the manor was separated from the small village of the same name, substantially reducing the number of poor people for whose support the lord of the manor was responsible.Fiege, Geschichte, p. 66 Duke Friedrich Karl Ludwig, by his only son Friedrich Wilhelm, the last Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck and the first of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg, was an ancestor to both Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, as well as to the royal houses of Denmark, Norway, Iceland and Greece, including Queen Sof√≠a of Spain, thus making Wellingsb√ºttel Manor in some respects a point of origin of nearly all today's European royal dynasties. During the Napoleonic Wars the duke had to leave Wellingsb√ºttel. At first two squadrons of the L√ºtzow Free Corps were stationed there. At the end of 1813 it became the headquarters of the Russian Lieutenant-General Alexander Ivanovich Ostermann-Tolstoy.Rackowitz p. 82 Wellingsb√ºttel Manor, park elevation with the pond made by damming the Alster River (1850) Outing at Wellingsb√ºttel Manor: Carl Jauch (left) and his wife Louise n√©e von Plessen (far left) (1868) In 1846 the Grand Burgher of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg Johann Christian Jauch junior (1802‚Äì1880), a member of the Jauch family, became Lord of Wellingsb√ºttel. As a result of the Second Schleswig War, when Denmark fought Prussia and Austria, Wellingsb√ºttel was annexed by Prussia in 1868 and became a part of the Province of Schleswig-Holstein but remained in the possession of the Jauchs. Johann Christian Jauch junior and his son Carl Jauch (1828‚Äì1888), who was Lord of Wellingsb√ºttel conjointly with his father, enlarged the area of the manor's grounds up to 1876 from 115 to 250 hectares by buying in numerous smallholdings of the impoverished rural population, demolishing all buildings and adding the lands to the manor's pleasure- grounds.Fiege, Geschichte, p. 70 The former proprietors were offered places in the almshouse in the nearby village of Wellingsb√ºttel, which was erected in 1858, and to which the Jauchs contributed fifty percent of the costs.Fiege, Hartwig, √úber die Wellingsb√ºtteler Gutsbesitzerfamilie Jauch in: Jahrbuch des Alstervereins 1984, Hamburg 1984 However, a considerable number of dispossessed people left Wellingsb√ºttel entirely, in such numbers that the royal chancellery at Copenhagen intervened to ask the Jauchs to keep at least the farmsteads on the land they acquired, when the teacher in Wellingsb√ºttel village complained that the continuing reduction in the number of paying pupils was costing him his livelihood. Instead of farming, Wellingsb√ºttel reached its zenith by becoming a place of social life and hunting. During the time of the Barons von Kurtzrock the Danish statesman Heinrich Carl von Schimmelmann had already been a hunting-guest.Rackowitz p. 68 The Jauchs established a deer-park which became a major attraction for summer visitors from Hamburg. Wellingsb√ºttel and its park had already become an attraction for visitors from Hamburg earlier: the poet Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock, for example, had mentioned his visit on 11 July 1756,Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock, Klaus Hurlebusch, Klopstocks Arbeitstagebuch, parts 2-3 of works, 1977, p. 102 and directories of the parks surrounding Hamburg listed the park of Wellingsb√ºttel Manor as belonging to \\"the most beautiful\\". Friedrich Johann Lorenz-Meyer described it as \\"Elysian abundance\\".Rackowitz p. 68, 69 The hunting-grounds were expanded by leasing the adjoining Duvenstedter Brook (\\"Duvenstedt swamps\\"), at that time part of the district of Stormarn. Today, after an interlude as the hunting-ground of Hamburg's Nazi Gauleiter Karl Kaufmann, the swamps are the town's largest and most beautiful nature reserve. The cooks and servants employed by the Jauchs became ancestors of a number of the present-day families of Wellingsb√ºttel. Wellingsb√ºttel was also the birthplace of the Freikorps leader during the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì19, Colonel Hans Jauch (1883‚Äì1965). In 1888 Robert Jauch of Krummbek Manor (1859‚Äì1909) and his siblings sold Wellingsb√ºttel Manor to C√§cilie Behrens, the widow of a Hamburg banker,Fiege, Geschichte, p. 81 a partner in L. Behrens & S√∂hne.:de:L. Behrens & S√∂hne She had the manor house heightened by one storey by the architect Martin Haller, but died soon after the completion of the works in 1892. In 1910 the then owner, Otto Jonathan H√ºbbe, a Hamburg merchant,Fiege, Geschichte, p. 83 made Wellingsb√ºttel part of a limited company (Aktiengesellschaft), jointly with the owners of the manors of Poppenb√ºttel and Sasel, in order to subdivide the land and to develop the Alster valley for housing. After World War I the company went into bankruptcy.Fiege, Geschichte, p. 99‚Äì103 With the Greater Hamburg Act Wellingsb√ºttel became part of Hamburg in 1937 and gave its name to the district of Hamburg-Wellingsb√ºttel, today a suburban villa development.Peter Braun, Die sozialr√§umliche Gliederung Hamburgs, Issue 10 of Weltwirtschaftliche Studien aus dem Institut f√ºr Europ√§ische Wirtschaftspolitik der Universit√§t Hamburg, Volume 10 of Weltwirtschaftliche Studien, p. 111 The city of Hamburg sold Wellingsb√ºttel Manor in 1966. The Hansa Kolleg, co-owned by the states of Bremen, Hamburg, and Schleswig- Holstein, used the manor house as a student hall of residence from 1964 till 1996.Fiege, Geschichte, p. 136; Today the house contains a private nursing home and a restaurant. Alstertal Museum The gatehouse seen from the courtyard, the right wing is now occupied by the Alstertal Museum Since 1957 the Alstertal Museum (Alstertalmuseum or \\"Museum of the Alster Valley\\") has occupied the left wing of the gatehouse (seen from the entrance to the manor). The museum, set up by the Alsterverein e.V., a society founded in 1900 for the preservation of the Alster Valley, presents a number of exhibitions, both permanent and changing, on aspects of the area of the Upper Alster. The permanent displays cover Wellingsb√ºttel, not only the estate and manor house but also the old village, including (with the permission of the Danish Crown) the only copy of the 1810 deed of enfeoffment of the Duke of Schleswig- Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck (see image above).

The region was inhabited by loosely related tribes that often were part of larger tribal conglomerations like the Dalmatae. In the late 5th and the early 4th century BC, the first polities of the area would be created as exemplified by Bardylis's Dardanian kingdom. In the course of the 4th century parts of the southernmost and easternmost regions of Illyria fell under the Kingdom of Macedon. The most powerful state of the area, the Ardiaean kingdom, emerged in the 3rd century BC during the rule of Agron and Teuta. It was defeated and conquered by the Roman Republic, which maintained a system of direct rule and client states before the final incorporation of the area into the Roman state after the Third Illyrian War.

Fredricks (July 14, 1918 ‚Äì July 4, 2010) was a German-American brass musician of the Big Bands Era of the 1930s and 1940s. He is known for his unique skills as a trumpeter and left his mark on a range of larger bands such as the orchestras of Alvino Rey, Charlie Spivak, Les Brown's Band of Renown, and Mel Torme's Mel-Tones, in the jazz music scene of the period surrounding World War II . He later ventured off with his own New Orleans-style Dixieland jazz band The Paul Fredricks Orchestra, later The Crescent City Stompers. He was featured in some Hollywood films including A. Edward Sutherland and RKO Pictures' Sing Your Worries Away (1942), starring Buddy Ebsen, Patsy Kelly and Bert Lahr. Early life and career Fredricks' grandparents were members of the German migration to the States in the 19th century. Raised near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, he received his first trumpet as a gift from his parents at the age of nine. He developed his skills playing on his own and in several local bands as a young boy until he left home at 16 to pursue his dreams in New York City's music scene of the time. Throughout his eight decades as a professional musician, he cultivated a versatile career and recognized musical style. Fredricks began his professional music career in New York City at the age of 16 playing gigs at the Lincoln Hotel in New York City and the Rustic Cabin in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, a launch pad of Frank Sinatra. He continued playing with big bands before and after the war, during which he voluntarily entered to serve in the United States Army in the Asia- Pacific Arena. In the years surrounding the war, he toured across the country and was featured in shows in Hollywood, California; The Roseland Ballroom, The Paramount Theater and The Palladium/Academy of Music in New York. In 1941, after Alvino Rey's group played at New York's Paramount Theater, which led to greater exposure, they became one of the most popular acts in the country, recording top ten hits and making appearances in Hollywood films including A. Edward Sutherland and RKO Pictures' Sing Your Worries Away (1942), and others. Rey re-organized the orchestra, expanding the brass section including Paul Fredricks. WWII and Beyond Fredricks served in the U.S. Army and toured the Asia-Pacific Arena serving his country in a number of roles. After the war, Fredricks was scouted by Charlie Spivak and played with his orchestra between 1946 and 1948. Paul retired from work with Charlie Spivak's Orchestra to start his own New Orlean's style jazz band The Paul Fredricks Orchestra, later The Crescent City Stompers, for which he led tours for many years to come. Personal life Fredricks met and married his wife of 57 years, Austrian beauty Theresa Elnicky. Although Spivak approached him to contribute to the brass section of his orchestra while he was still in the service, Fredricks completed his duty before Theresa joined him on tour in 1947. The couple toured together for years to come including with Spivak and his own band The Crescent City Stompers (formerly The Paul Fredricks Orchestra) Theresa herself turned down opportunities to pursue a Hollywood career in order to focus on her marriage and three children with a home base near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His granddaughter is a fashion model and humanitarian Kate Gibbs.

Laufenburger (September 5, 1921 ‚Äì September 20, 2001) was a Minnesota politician and a member of the Minnesota Senate who represented the old District 2 and, after the 1972 redistricting, District 34, which included portions of Olmsted, Wabash and Winona counties in the southeastern part of the state. A Democrat, he was elected to the Senate in 1962, and was re- elected in 1966, 1970, 1972, and 1976. Service in the Senate Laufenburger first ran for the Senate in 1958 against incumbent Senator James \\"J.R.\\" Keller. While unsuccessful in that race, he did unseat Keller in 1962. Keller's daughter, Pat Kronebusch, would later unseat Laufenburger in 1980. When Laufenburger was first elected, the Minnesota Legislature was officially non-partisan, divided into the Liberal and Conservative caucuses. This structure remained in effect until 1976, when declaring party affiliation became a requirement for candidates. While in the Senate, Laufenburger chaired the Transportation and General Legislation Committee from 1973 to 1976, and the Employment Committee from 1977 to 1980. He was a member of the Agriculture, Civil Administration, Commerce and Insurance, Game and Fish, General Legislation, Labor Relations, Military Affairs and Civil Defense, Municipal Affairs, Public Highways, Rules and Administration, and Taxes and Tax Laws committees. He also served on the Commerce Subcommittee for Banking, the Labor and Commerce Subcommittee for Commerce and Insurance, the Rules and Administration subcommittees for Interim Commissions and for Joint Rule 20 (Deadlines), and the Transportation and General Legislation subcommittees for Highways and Bridges, for Joint Fuel Oil (which he chaired from 1973 to 1974), for Public Transportation, and for Transportation Policy (which he chaired in 1979). An early advocate for rural highways in Minnesota, his special legislative concerns included transportation, business, agriculture, and labor-employment. Service to the state and community From the town of Lewiston in Winona County, Laufenburger was active in the community before and after his time in the Senate. A graduate of Winona High School, he was a local insurance agency owner and radio announcer, perhaps best known for his radio show \\"Roger's Rumpus Room.\\" He served as a justice of the peace in Lewiston from 1951 to 1953, and was later a member of the village council from 1956 to 1962. After leaving the Senate, he again served on the city's council from 1989 to 1992, and was mayor from 1992 to 2001. He was named to the Winona County Fair Hall of Fame in 1986.

The name comes from the name of its leader B. J. Field.  History  Born Max Gould in 1903, B. J. Field had been a successful Columbia educated petroleum analyst on Wall Street before the crash of 1929. Afterwards he became a Trotskyist and led informal discussion groups at his home with the other members. Field was expelled following the New York Hotel strike of January 1934 for not accepting CLA discipline and not getting adequate safeguards for former strikers against discrimination. Field was later removed from leadership of the Amalgamated Food Workers union because a rival union, the Communist-led Food Workers Industrial Union, had gained shop floor leadership during the course of the unsuccessful strike. By the end of 1934, the Amalgamated Food Workers had merged into the Food Workers Industrial Union.Kimmeldord, Howard. Battling For American Labor: Wobblies, Craft Workers, and the Making of the Union Movement, University of California Press, 1999. pgs. 145-147. In his book on the history of American Trotskyism, James P. Cannon ‚Äì at the time a major leader of the CLA ‚Äì provides a detailed (though manifestly polemic and hostile) account of Field's antecedents and his part in the hotel strike.James P. Cannon, History of American Trotskyism, Pathfinder Press, New York, 1972 (originally published 1944), Ch. VII, \\"The Turn to Mass Work\\", pp. 126-133 As noted by Cannon, in the late 1920s some CLA members happened to be involved in the Amalgamated Food Workers union which had been reduced in power and influence after the Communist Party split the union in 1930. In 1932, the CLA regarded the sudden upsurge in unionism among the hard-pressed hotel workers as its big chance, throwing much of its resources and membership into this struggle ‚Äì among them B.J. Field. A statistician, economist and linguist, Field had no previous trade union experience, but his fluent knowledge of French was of crucial importance in establishing contact with the hotels' French chefs, many of whom did not speak English. Because of the chefs' prestige and their being \\"the most strategically important sector in the hotel situation\\", their adherence to the strike was a major coup, for which Field got credit. For their part, the chefs insisted that Field be placed at the head of the new union. In this position he got much into the public eye and had his photo in the New York papers. His fame and prestige soared especially after a series of mass meetings, the biggest of which ‚Äì at the annex of the Madison Square Garden ‚Äì drew a crowd of no less than 10,000 people. Thereafter, as Cannon put it, success went to Field's head and he became increasingly distant from the CLA, which he came to regard as \\"a marginal group of people at a small office on Sixteenth Street\\" while he was himself \\"the leader of a upsurging mass movement\\". The CLA criticized Field for neglecting the grassroots base of the strike, and placing excessive trust in the mediators sent by the National Labor Board and by New York Mayor La Guardia. However, Field refused altogether to meet with fellow activists or the CLA bodies and to discuss his way of conducting the hotel strike. Thereupon, the CLA decided to take the drastic step of expelling Field and his group of adherents, in the middle of the strike ‚Äì rather than be held responsible for his policies without having a possibility of influencing them. One of Field's most important collaborators in this strike was a young Greek- American, Aristodimos Kaldis, who would later have a career as a landscape artist. During the strike the CLA elements worked closely with a group of dissident Lovestoneites led by Benjamin Gitlow called the Workers Communist League. After being expelled the group around Field and Kaldis joined Gitlow's group, which now became the Organizing Committee for a Revolutionary Workers Party Max Shachtman \\"New Group forms for New Party\\" The Militant vol. VII #21, p. 3 Though the membership of the group was small in the United States, it was more successful in Canada, taking the whole Montreal section and some of the Toronto branch members from the CLA in April of that year. Under the leadership of William Krehm they overshadowed the official Trotskyist movement in Canada by 1937.Wald, Alan M. The New York intellectuals: the rise and decline of the anti-Stalinist left from the 1930s to the 1980s Chapel Hill, North Carolina; UNC Press 1987 The Gitlow group didn't stay long and by October 1934 had decided to enter the Socialist Party of America This left the Fieldites with few experienced Communist or labor leaders. The group then began negotiations for unity with a variety of other groups, including the Communist League of Struggle, the Revolutionary Workers League and a small group of Italian-American Bordigists. None of these was successful. In May 1936 the majority of the New York branch voted to rejoin the Trotskyists, but a minority stayed with Field in a reduced organization. According to one report, from a hostile source, when two members of the New York local F. L Demby and S. Stanley submitted a statement favoring dissociation from the LRWP during a meeting of the New York local Field had the door locked and he and his supporters physically attacked them. In any event a reported eight out of the groups twelve members left.\\"Anti-Trotsky cliques fold up\\" New Militant Vol. 2 #22 June 6, 1936 p.2 Among the associates of the league was a group of Columbia university students which included future philosopher Morton White, who was drawn to the group because it was harsher on the Soviet Union than the Trotskyites. They had come to the conclusion that capitalism had already been restored in Stalinist Russia, and was no longer a degenerated workers state. The LRWP was affiliated to the International Revolutionary Marxist Centre (often referred to as the London Bureau) with Field and Krehm attending the international association's Congress Against War, Fascism and Imperialism held in Brussels in 1936. After being expelled from his own organization, Field dropped out of politics and joined former supporter Nat Mendelsohn's prosperous real estate firm in California. He died in 1977. The exact date of the group's dissolution is uncertain, though a number of members rejoined the Trotskyist movement in the late 1930s. In April 1940 the remaining Fieldites published a special bulletin addressed to the convention of the Socialist Workers Party (United States), urging it to adopt its perspective on the USSR, which the Fieldites regarded as totalitarian rather than state capitalist. They believed \\"Russian question\\" was the most important issue facing the working class movement.\\"The LRWP enlightens the Trotskyites\\" in Bulletin of the Leninist League (US) Vol. III #4 April‚ÄìMay 1940 They seem to have finally disbanded sometime later in 1940.Arthur Burk \\"The exit of a pseudo-Marxist Group\\" in Bulletin of the Leninist League Vol. III #6 Sept-Nov 1940  Periodicals  The Fieldites published The Workers' Voice in Canada, Labor Front in the United States, a theoretical journal called Maitland ‚Äì New International Bulletin, Workers Anti-War Bulletin and Revolutionary Youth, by the party's youth section.

At the Battle of Gettysburg he briefly led the brigade of the wounded Alfred M. Scales. Biography Lowrance was born on July 26, 1836 in Mooresville, North Carolina, the son of John Nichols Lowrance and Jane Kilpatrick. He attended Davidson College. Lowrance became a lieutenant in D company of the 34th North Carolina Infantry in September 1861, eventually rising to colonel by December 1862. He led the regiment in the brigade of Brigadier General William Dorsey Pender, part of Major General A. P. Hill's Light Division at the Battle of Fredericksburg and possibly at the Battle of Chancellorsville.Sibley, p. 43, suggests Lowrance was absent. After Chancellorsville, Pender became division commander, and Brigadier General Alfred M. Scales took command of the brigade. At Gettysburg, Lowrance was wounded on the first day of fighting, but he later took command of the brigade in place of Scales, who had been severely wounded. Lowrance found the brigade sadly depleted, but he led it in Pickett's Charge on July 3, 1863. According to his report, the brigade and that of Brigadier General James H. Lane numbered no more than 800 troops. They advanced following the division led by Brigadier General J. Johnston Pettigrew, but they retreated upon finding themselves nearly alone in front of the federal line on Cemetery Ridge. Col. Lowrance returned to his regiment when Gen. Scales rejoined the Army of Northern Virginia. Lowrance led the regiment in the Bristoe Campaign and the Mine Run Campaign. He fought in the Battle of the Wilderness and subsequent actions, including the earlier stages of the Siege of Petersburg. Col. Lowrance led the brigade briefly when Scales was ill in late May 1864, including at the Battle of North Anna.Sibley, p. 112. He led the brigade again when Scales was absent ill in November 1864.Sibley, p. 157. Col. Lowrance went on sick leave on February 2, 1865 and did not return to the Army.Sibley, p. 395 n. 128. After the War, Lowrance was a merchant in Oxford, Mississippi and served in that state's legislature. In 1880, he moved to Texas and became a minister. He was the pastor of Oak Cliff Presbyterian Church in Dallas, Texas. Lowrance died in Forestville, Texas on March 24, 1916. He married Sarah C. Stewart in Atlanta, Georgia. They had four sons and two daughters. References *And Then A.P. Hill Came Up * F.

The bank has 2 branches: one in Oakwood, Texas and one in Dallas, Texas. The bank is a subsidiary of Oakwood Bancshares, Inc., a bank holding company. History The bank was founded in 1900 under the name Oakwood State Bank. In 1958, Roddy Rawls Wiley, Jr. took over the bank after his father died. In 2005, the bank received a \\"substantial noncompliance\\" rating for lack of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. In 2009, the bank was referred to as \\"America's Smallest Bank\\" as it had only $3 million in total assets and $2.13 million in total deposits. For most of its existence, in addition to Wiley, the bank had only 2 other employees, 76-year-old Lela Coates and 71-year-old Neta Eldridge. It had no automated teller machines. After the death of Wiley in 2010, the bank was acquired by Dorothy Cadenhead. In April 2017, the bank raised $38 million in capital by selling a controlling stake to new management, allowing the bank to open a branch in Dallas, Texas. The bank also changed its name from \\"Oakwood State Bank\\" to \\"Oakwood Bank\\".

Many of his works consist of arrangements of mass- produced objects, displayed on shelves of his own design. Life and work Since the late 1970s Steinbach's art has been focused on the selection and arrangement of objects, above all everyday objects. In order to bring them to light, he has been conceiving structures and framing devices for their presentation. Steinbach presents objects, ranging from the natural to the ordinary, the artistic to the ethnographic, giving form to art works that underscore their identity and inherent meanings. Exploring the psychological, aesthetic, cultural and ritualistic aspects of objects as well as their context, Steinbach has redefined the status of the object in art. He lives and works in New York with his partner, Gwen Smith and son.https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/artist/haim-steinbach Exhibitions After his 1979 and 1980 solo shows at Artists Space and Fashion Moda in the New York, Steinbach's interest in the world of objects made him a significant figure in the creative discourse of Eighties' New York.

Shell description  The shell is rather strongly convex, acuminate-ovate in outline, broadly and regularly rounded behind, pointed in front where the apex projects slightly beyond the margin of the aperture. The apex is incurved. The surface is marked by distinct, rounded, radiating lines, which in the outer half maintain an approximately equal size through bifurcation. There are about ten lines in 5 mm. The whole surface is with very fine concentric lines. Irregular wrinkles are marking stages of growth at intervals of 1 to 3 mm. The length of the shell is 24.5 mm, width 19 mm and the height of the shell is 4.5 mm. This species is closely related to the Upper Silurian Helcionopsis radiatum, which is a little more convex, the anterior outline blunter and the apex more incurved.  Distribution  It is rare in the upper beds of the Cincinnati formation, Marion County, Kentucky. Also, though of smaller size in the Loraine group at Cincinnati, Ohio.
