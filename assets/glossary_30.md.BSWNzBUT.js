ResProx calculates resolution from coordinate data rather than from electron density or other experimental inputs. This makes it possible to calculate the resolution of a structure regardless of how it was solved (X-ray, NMR, EM, modeling, ab initio prediction). ResProx was originally designed to serve as a simple, single- number evaluation that allows straightforward comparison between the quality/resolution of X-ray structures and the quality of a given NMR structure. However, it can also be used to assess the reliability of an experimentally reported X-ray structure resolution, to evaluate protein structures solved by unconventional or hybrid means and to identify fraudulent structures deposited in the PDB. ResProx incorporates more than 25 different structural features to determine a single resolution-like value. ResProx values are reported in Angstroms. Tests on thousands of X-ray structures show that ResProx values match very closely to resolution values reported by X-ray crystallographers. Resolution-by-proxy values can be calculated for newly determined protein structures using a freely accessible ResProx web server. This server accepts protein coordinate data (in PDB format) and generates a resolution estimate (in Angstroms) for that input structure.  Background and Rationale  In X-ray crystallography, resolution is a measure of the resolvability or precision in the electron density map of a molecule. Resolution is usually reported in Angstroms (10‚Äì10 meters) for X-ray crystal structures. The smaller the number, the better the degree of atomic resolution. In protein X-ray crystallography the best resolution typically attainable is about 1 Angstrom. This level of resolution allows individual hydrogen atoms to be visualized and heavy atoms (C, O, N) to be very accurately mapped. Most protein structures solved today have a resolution of 1.5 to 2.5 Angstroms, which means the hydrogen atoms are not visible and there is some uncertainty in the precise location of the heavy atoms. Protein structures with a resolution of >2.5 Angstroms generally have a number of coordinate inaccuracies as well as other structural problems. When the resolution is greater than 3.5 Angstroms, there is often considerable uncertainty in both the atom locations and even the identity of individual amino residues. In other words, resolution is inversely correlated with structure quality (i.e. higher numbers mean poorer structures). This trend in protein structure quality for X-ray resolution matches very closely to the trend seen the quality of NMR-determined protein structures. Some NMR structures have large numbers of constraints (NOEs, H-bonds, J-couplings, dipolar couplings), excellent geometry, high structure quality and very tight ensembles with excellent atomic precision (RMSDs < 1 Angstrom). Other NMR structures have very few constraints, poor geometry or poor structure quality and very loose ensembles (RMSDs > 3 Angstroms). However, there is no simple mapping between NMR RMSD values and X-ray resolution values. That is, an NMR ensemble with 1 Angstrom RMSD does not correspond in quality or precision to an X-ray structure with 1 Angstrom resolution. This is because the RMSD measure is both a function of the number of structures used in the ensemble and the selection bias of the spectroscopist who deposits the structural ensemble. Likewise, in NMR it is possible to generate high quality, precisely determined protein structures using relatively few, well-chosen constraints. It is also possible to generate very low quality NMR structures from large numbers of carelessly assessed, mistaken or mis-assigned constraints. Over the past 20 years several methods have been proposed to calculate ‚Äúequivalent resolution‚Äù using only X-ray coordinate data (rather than X-ray diffraction data). Some were designed specifically for evaluating NMR structures such as Procheck-NMR while others were designed more for structure quality evaluation and validation of X-ray structures such as MolProbity, and RosettaHoles2. However, these methods rely on a relatively small number of protein structure quality measures to predict resolution (4, 3, and 1 measures, respectively) and consequently the correlation between observed (X-ray) resolution and the predicted resolution is not particularly good. By expanding the number of structure features to include the distribution of torsion angles, the presence of atom clashes, the normality of hydrogen bonding, the numbers of violations of bond lengths and bond angles, the presence of cavities, residue-specific packing volumes, packing efficiency and threading energies it is possible to improve this correlation quite substantially.  The ResProx Algorithm  ResProx uses a collection of 25 different protein structure features (such as torsion angle distributions, hydrogen bonding, packing volume, cavities, Molprobity measures) that were used in a Support Vector Regression method to maximize the correlation between the predicted resolution and the observed X-ray resolution on a set of 2400 protein structures with known X-ray resolution. The exact details of the algorithm are provided in a paper published by Dr. Wishart and colleagues. After training and appropriate validation on independent tests sets, this SVR model is able to estimate the resolution of solved X-ray structures with a correlation coefficient of 0.92, mean absolute error of 0.28 Angstroms. This is about 15-30% better than existing methods. This is shown in Figure 1. Because the performance of the ResProx method is so high and because it only needs coordinate data to generate an estimate of the equivalent X-ray resolution, it is ideally suited to be applied to NMR structures. When NMR structures are analyzed by ResProx, the average NMR structure has an equivalent X-ray resolution of 2.8 Angstroms‚Äîwhich is relatively poor (Fig. 2). This is in agreement with qualitative observations regarding the overall quality and precision of NMR structures. As seen in Figure 2, a very small number NMR structures exhibit a resolution equivalent to < 1.0 Angstroms‚Äîbut these are rare. Figure 1. Performance of ResProx against training and testing data. Figure 2. Histogram of ResProx equivalent resolution for NMR models and experimental resolution for X-ray structures. 500 NMR ensembles and 500 X-ray structures were randomly selected from the PDB. Proteins were grouped in 0.25√Ö resolution bins. Resolution values on the X-axis indicate the upper limit of each resolution bin. Values for NMR structures and X-ray structures represent the number of structures in each resolution bin.  The ResProx Server  The ResProx web server a freely accessible server that accepts NMR protein coordinate data (in PDB format) and generates a resolution estimate (in Angstroms) for that NMR structure. A downloadable version of ResProx is also available. ResProx also provides a list of List of 50834 protein structures with PDB identifiers along with their observed resolution and corresponding ResProx values.

Heather Raffo Official Website. Retrieved on April 13, 2014. This painting was made by Layla al-Attar.Romanska, p. 219. Raffo was curious about the life of Al-Attar, and in the play she placed the al-Attar character prominently. Raffo had, for ten years, interviewed Iraqi women from various social backgrounds, and she used this information to write the play.Hirschhorn, Joel. \\"Review: ‚ÄòNine Parts of Desire‚Äô.\\" Variety. September 15, 2005. Retrieved on April 12, 2014. Some women were strangers to her and some were relatives. According to Raffo, \\"[being an Iraqi] got me in the door\\" but that the women were more willing to confide in her because she was also an American.Romanska, 213. In 1998 Raffo declared that she would use this concept as her Master of Fine Arts thesis.Romanska, 213-214. As part of the thesis, she did a 20-minute performance at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego, California.Twair, p. 58. The final play was created in 2003.Romanska, 214. Characters The characters are composites of the Iraqi women Raffo had interviewed. If one actress portrays all the characters, she may wear an abaya differently each time she portrays a distinct character.Morales, Jorge. \\"Smart Bombs.\\" The Village Voice. Tuesday October 19, 2004. Retrieved on April 14, 2014. There were no changes of costume in Raffo's original performance, and instead there was only a difference in how the abaya is worn. In the play Raffo used different accents to portray regional and class differences; at the time she first performed the play she did not know Arabic. The abaya itself is also used as a prop. The women are, in order: Mulaya, Layal, Amal, Huda, the doctor, the girl, Umm Ghada, the American, and Nanna. *Mulaya - The first character in the play. Mulaya is a woman who responds and lead calls to women at funerals. The play does not state the identity of the person who hired Mulaya. Magda Romanska of Alif: Journal of Comparative Poetics wrote that Mulaya's mourning is directed at all of Iraq rather than a specific person, and that \\"In a way, she is more symbolic figuration than character\\".Romanska, p. 218. \\"Mulaya\\" is the traditional name of a woman hired at funerals. ** Joel Hirschhorn of Variety describes her as \\"a poignant, pitiable figure.\\" *Layal (the name means \\"all the nights\\") - She is the play's main speaker. An artist from Baghdad, Layal is the curator of the Saddam Art Center. Layal has a privileged position and she is the only artist in Iraq allowed to make nude paintings.Romanska, p. 220 She had been forced into having sexual relations with Saddam's sons. She had watched the execution of one of her friends, who died after being fed to dogs. She survives during the rule of Saddam because she painted portraits of Saddam Hussein.Lahr, John. \\"THE FURY AND THE JURY.\\" The New Yorker. Posted on November 1, 2004, in the issue of November 8, 2004. Retrieved on April 13, 2014. The end of the play reveals that Layal has been killed in a bombing by American missile.Romanska, p. 233. She is based on an Iraqi artist, Layla Attar, who died in 1993 after her house was bombed by American missile. ** When Raffo played Layal, in the words of Maria Beach of the Theatre Journal, she \\"[moved] with a confident grace that is betrayed by nervous giggles\\" and \\"[stroked] her throat sensually\\". The abaya is draped on the character's shoulders. ** Romanska wrote that Layal \\"struggles to maintain a coherent self-image\\" because she feels trapped by the conflicting perceptions of herself being a victim, collaborator, and critic of Saddam's government, and that Layal operates on a survival mode because she is so deeply traumatized by what she has experienced.Romanska, p. 221. Billington wrote that even though Layal is \\"apparently compromised by her complicity with Saddam's regime\\" she \\"defends herself vigorously and, through her painting, brings to life a wide range of oppressed Iraqi women\\". John Lahr of The New Yorker wrote that \\"Of the many atrocities that the women report, the most compelling is the spiritual mutation of Layal, whose collaboration with Saddam‚Äôs regime leaves her internally empty and morally bankrupt. She is beyond shame or pity.\\" Hirschhorn argues that Layal is the \\"most fascinating personality\\" of the play. Romanska also wrote that Layal both subtly criticizes Saddam's government and sympathizes with it at the same time. *Amal - A Bedouin woman who talks about her romantic issues, Amal, who wears an abaya, is fat, and the production calls for the costume to give the appearance of a fat woman. Beach described Amal as \\"sweetly sensitive\\". In her story, she moves to London with her husband and two children.Romanska, p. 222. She discovers that her husband is having sexual intercourse with her best friend. Nine Parts of Desire does not state whether she divorced her husband; Amal moves back to Iraq after her discovery, leaving her husband. She later moves to Israel and becomes the second wife of one of her father's friends, an Arab tribesman. Amal takes care of the eight children of the first wife because that wife leaves for periods of several months. Amal leaves the Israeli Arab when he does not take the family to Canada like he promises. In Baghdad, Amal is rejected by a friend of her ex-husband after the two have a year-long correspondence over the telephone. She returns to her first husband who is still in London.Romanska, p. 223. ** Lauren Sandler of The New York Times wrote that Amal \\"confesses heartbreak and desire in a monologue that sounds more HBO than how some audiences might perceive women in the Middle East.\\" The woman who Amal was based on saw a production of the play in 2003. *Huda (or Hooda) - Huda, 70 years old, is a resident of London who believes that the United States should have removed Saddam Hussein from power during the 1991 Gulf War. Hooda drinks and smokes. A leftist and an academic, Huda left Iraq in 1963.Isherwood, Charles. \\"A Solitary Woman, Embodying All of Iraq.\\" The New York Times. October 14, 2004.

She had treated various injuries related to war. The doctor's hospital is in a poor condition and she encounters negative effects of uranium weapons,Twair, p. 59. including newborn babies with mutations. Her name is not stated and she is referred to as \\"The Doctor\\". *The Girl - A 9-year-old girl, this character has no name. Her mother withdrew her from school after some American soldiers had visited the school. She actively follows American popular culture, such as listening to 'N Sync, through the television and satellite, and she believes American soldiers appear like Justin Timberlake. Romanska states that she describes violent events and possibilities \\"matter-of-factly, so used to the twisted reality around her that she appears unaware of its horror.\\" Romanska states that it is common for survivors of traumatic events to feel a sense of numbness.Romanska, p. 226. The girl describes the death of her grandparents; they were unwilling to answer the door and did not speak English, and a tank killed them afterwards. The girl can distinguish types of weapons from hearing them fired. Romanska stated, \\"She is proud of this skill and brags about it with a blas√© attitude, on the same emotional scale with which she chats about Justin Timberlake and Oprah\\". **Beach stated that when Raffo played the girl, she \\"[danced] with awkward exuberance to music videos on satellite television.\\" The character wears the abaya twisted into a braid. *Umm Ghada \\\\- She describes the United States-perpetrated February 13, 1991 Amiriyah shelter bombing, in which she lost her family. She had since become a caretaker of the site, serving as its guide, while living a yellow trailer outside of the site and calling herself \\"Umm Ghada\\" or \\"mother of Ghada\\" after her deceased daughter.Romanska, p. 228. The name \\"Ghada\\" also means \\"tomorrow\\" and the character states \\"so I am Umm Ghada, Mother of Tomorrow. My full name is dead with them.\\"Romanska, p. 229. Umm Ghada makes it her singular life mission to tell the world what had happened, and Romanska states that this reaction is typical of trauma survivors; Romanska added that \\"Her life never returns to normal, as she is unable to function outside of the shelter\\", and that she had lost her personal identity as a result of the bombing.Romanska, p. 228-229. Umm Ghada is based on a real person.Romanska, p. 227. **Twair argues she is \\"[p]erhaps the most tragic\\" character.Twair, p. 59. *The American - Un-named, she is an Iraqi American exile in Manhattan,Twair, p. 57. has family in Iraq, and watches the news of the war there. Her monologues are scattered throughout the play. She is anxious for news about her family. She recites the names of Iraqi relatives while holding a rosary and watching CNN coverage of bombing in Baghdad. She engages in trivial pursuits in order to stay sane but cannot enjoy them. Romanska wrote \\"Watching the bombs come down on her family neighborhood, the American is stunned by her own sense of alienation: She has grown to identify herself as an American, and now, she is asked to view herself as the other, the enemy.\\"Romanska, p. 230. Pat McDonnell Twair of The Middle East wrote that the character \\"may even be Raffo herself\\". Romanska refers to her as the \\"alter ego\\" of Raffo. *Nanna - An elderly street peddler who had lived through Iraq's political turmoil, she sells objects salvaged from destroyed structures to U.S. Marines. The final item she attempts to sell is Savagery, a painting by Layal. The play indicates in this way that Layal is now dead. **Marilyn Stasio of Variety describes her as a \\"Mother Courage-like figure\\".

Raffo and Amir ElSaffar, an Iraqi maqam musician, created a concert version. This version played at The Kennedy Center. Reception Magda Romanska of Alif: Journal of Comparative Poetics wrote that there was a \\"general enthusiasm\\" for the play when it was first released.Romanska, p. 212. She stated that at the time of the release, \\"There was curiosity about Iraq and Iraqis in the US, at the same time as the invasion was presented to American people as if it were meant to 'liberate' Iraq, and particularly oppressed Iraqi women.\\" The writing of the play occurred before the 2003 Invasion of Iraq but the release happened after the invasion. In 2003 The Independent named this play as one of the five best plays. In regards to the 2003 performance at the Traverse Theatre, Billington wrote that \\"Although Raffo is a fine actress, her transitions from one character to another are not always sharply defined. But aesthetic niggles pale beside the importance of her subject.\\" Twair wrote that the performance in London in the September 2003 season was ranked among the best five plays in London. Bernardo gave the performance opening on October 9, 2004 an \\"A-\\".

He was responsible for many early Geelong buildings, including hotels, mansions and churches. Early life Edward Prowse was born in 1824 in the Bristol region in England. Prowse emigrated to Australia at the age of 25 with his friend Edward Snell, having first considered America. He arrived in Adelaide on the Bolton on 29 November 1849.John Cattell, EDWARD SNELL'S DIARY: A JOURNEYMAN ENGINEER IN BATH IN THE 1840s Prowse and Snell met at the Avonside Ironworks in Bristol, Snell called him 'one of the respectables'. Prowse introduced Snell to the writings of Thomas Paine and almost succeeded in converting him to deism, prompting something of a crisis of faith. Prowse married Mary Ann Carbin (n√©e South) in Geelong, Mary Anne, had previously been married to Thomas Carbin of Adelaide.Ancestry.com Message Board, 'Death date and place for Thomas Carbin d abt 1851 please' Eward and Mary had at a large number of children, including Ellen (Nellie) Prowse 1854-1944, born at Geelong, Victoria. Nellie died a spinster without issue.Ancestry.com Message Board Ellen Prowse (see also \\"Prowse Family History\\" by Mrs Sandor L Tako (Susan Tako) Hendersonville, North Carolina) pages 195-6. compiled by Erwin MATTHEWS, husband of Pam PROWSE. Prowse first moved to Yatala, South Australia (on the north east outskirts of Adelaide), where in 1850 he obtained the position as Clerk, Collector and Surveyor to the District Road Board of the Hundred of Yatala, but resigned this position in 1852. This may have been to try his luck on the Victorian gold fields, as he returned in 1855 and was appointed engineer for what had become the Shire of Yatala, but he appeared to develop a conflict with some of the councillors, who sacked him, but he was reinstated when he reapplied for his position. Architectural and surveying practice Prowse formed a partnership with Edward Snell in May 1854 after Snell's former partner, Frederick Kawerau decided to return to Germany.Huddle, Lorraine, 1983-03, Architects of early Geelong [Series of parts] Investigator, Vols. 18 & 19Edward Snell, The Life and Adventures of Edward Snell, The Illustrated Diary of an Artist, Engineer and Adventurer in the Australian Colonies 1849, 1988, p. 344. the partnership was dissolved in 1855. His extensive architectural practice in Geelong is recorded in the Geelong Advertiser, including: listing as architect for Ingleby and called tenders for erection of dwelling (Raith) at Herne Hill (18 September 1854); tenders called by Snell & Prowse for erection of a store, Victoria Terrace for George Armytage (which became Dennys' store later) (5 May 1855); tenders for the erection of a 3-storey house at the corner of Yarra and Corio Streets (13 July 1855); erecting a new building near Moorabool Pier (27 July 1857); tenders for \\"Hermitage\\" (4 May 1858); called tenders for a new store Lt. Malop Street (23 April 1861); and called for tenders for brick additions, Christ Church School (20 June 1861).GEELONG HERITAGE CENTRE GEELONG ADVERTISER INDEX 1850‚Äì1866 A-E The architecture practice was evidently booming in the height of the gold rushes, causing Prowse to advertise for a trainee architect in 1856. Prowse was appointed town surveyor in Geelong, but was dismissed in 1860, in what appears to be a personal feud with some councillors. A vote in council reinstated him when he reapplied for the position. Prowse investigated the railway accident in 1857, with John Millar, Engineer-ln-Chief to the Geelong Water Commission, which was caused when two trains collided near Little River. He also lectured at the Geelong Mechanics Institute on architectural subjects. Edward Prowse was engineer on the Corio District Roads Board up to his death in 1862, when he was succeeded by J. V.

At it is New Zealand's largest forest park. The park is administered by the Department of Conservation (DOC). The park is made up of pristine beech forest and includes all five species of beech found in new Zealand - red, silver, mountain, black and hard beech. The park includes the Inangahua, Maruia and Grey Rivers, and the Victoria and Brunner Ranges. Reefton is the main town in the area and is located on the South Western edge of the park. Reefton was once a coal and gold mining town and as such, old mining equipment can still be found in the Park  Establishment of Victoria Forest Park  During the 1970s, fourteen forests parks were set up as a result of pressure from environmentalists. It wasn‚Äôt until 1981 that Victoria Forest Park was afforded the same protection.  Ecology  Victoria Forest Park is predominantly made up of beech forests which is also the largest remaining indigenous forest type in New Zealand as beech forests are normally located on mountain landscapes not suitable for farming and were therefore not cleared. Dependent on beech forest survival are three types of mistletoe, which include crimson mistletoe (Peraxilla colensoi), pirirangi or red mistletoe (Peraxilla tetrapetala) and the Alepis flavida. All three species of mistletoe are at risk of extinction as a result of possum browse. The beech forests also support the scale insect, which is a vital for the food supply of native bird and insect species. The scale insect lives in the bark of beech trees drawing in sap, which it then excretes as honeydew and is an important energy source for tui, bellbirds and kaka. The Victoria Forest Park provides essential habitat for a large array of fauna, just a fraction of which are described below. = Fauna =  Bellbird (Anthonis melanura)  Bellbirds inhabit native forest, including beech forest, and were previously common throughout New Zealand but significantly declined in number at about the same time ship rats and stoats arrived. These predators are still keeping bellbird numbers low today. The bellbirds play an important role in pollination of many native New Zealand plant species especially the New Zealand mistletoes, fuchsia and kowhai  Kaka (Nestor meridionalis)  The kaka is a forest parrot that was once widespread throughout New Zealand but in the last 100 years they have become far less abundant. This is a result of the mammalian predator numbers which increase significantly in years when beech trees seed as this also happens to be the only time when the kaka attempts to breed. Additionally, the kaka has to compete with wasps and possums for the honeydew produced by the native scale insects within beech forests.  Blue duck/whio (Hymenolaimus malacorhynchos)  The blue duck is one of only six species of waterfowl that permanently inhabits rivers. It inhabits rivers within Victoria Forest Park as well as other parts of New Zealand, feeding primarily on aquatic invertebrates. Blue duck numbers have declined over the last 100 years as a result of predation by introduced mammals and habitat destruction.  Tomtit (Petroica macrocephala)  The South Island tomtit is a common small native forest bird of South Island New Zealand inhabiting various types of forests and shrub lands. Males are mainly black and white while females are mainly brown and white. The main threat to the tomtit is introduced mammals as they make easy prey because they nest in cavities and so are not able to escape from predators  Great spotted kiwi (Apteryx haastii)  The great spotted kiwi is not as widely distributed throughout New Zealand as it once was. There are thought to be approximately 22,000 distributed throughout South Island however the number remaining within the Victoria Forest Park is thought to be very low. It is estimated that great spotted kiwi populations has reduced by about 30% since European settlement. It is thought that the introduction of stoats and possums has caused the great spotted kiwi to migrate to higher altitudes, possibly because these environments are less favourable to introduced predators. Video surveillance shows stoats and possums entering kiwi nests, but incubating adults are normally able to repel them, however the predators do manage to eat some eggs and possibly damage others.  Rock wren (Xenicus gilviventris)  Small numbers of rock wren have been recorded in Victoria Forest Park. The rock wren is listed as a \\"Nationally Vulnerable\\" in the New Zealand Threat Classification, and is a small ground-feeding subpasserine that spends its life above the tree line on the South Island of New Zealand. Because of the harsh environment the rock wren inhabits, very little scientific study has been carried out. Mice and stoats are identified as predators of rock wren eggs and young as a result of the birds poor flight ability and ground-feeding habit.  Powelliphanta snails  There are at least 21 species and 51 sub-species of Powelliphanta snail, 40 of which are threatened, and are found only in New Zealand. They are the largest snails in the world, growing up to 90 mm across. They are carnivorous and prey upon earthworms.  Western weka (Gallirallus australia)  The western weka is the most common of the weka sub-species however it is still classed as vulnerable. It is a large flightless bird and had been introduced to offshore islands, which was unsuccessful because of predatory impacts on other native fauna  Kea bird (Nestor notabilis)  The kea is a vulnerable bird species found all along the west coast of the New Zealand South Island and is the world‚Äôs only alpine parrot. Because they nest on the ground, predators attack a large proportion of nests during breeding  Yellow-crowned parakeet (Cyanoramphus auriceps)  The yellow-crowned parakeet is a rare species of parakeet found on the North and South Islands of New Zealand, including beech forests. They were once a common bird however, during the 1800s large numbers would feed on farmers grain and fruit crops and as a result, they were seen as a pest and shot by farmers = Flora =  Crimson mistletoe (Peraxilla colensoi) and red mistletoe (Peraxilla tetrapetala)  Found all over New Zealand are various species of mistletoe. Species of mistletoe found within the Victoria Forest Park include the crimson mistletoe and the red mistletoe, both of which are threatened. Studies have demonstrated a decline in mistletoe distribution throughout New Zealand, which is likely to be attributed to the brush tail possum, loss of pollinating and dispersing birds and over collecting. Some species of mistletoe are insect pollinated however most rely on birds for dispersal. Possums also browse the foliage of mistletoes, sometimes so significantly that plants are killed.  Environmental threats  = Introduced species = Prior to human arrival in New Zealand the only mammals present were three species of bats. However, since human arrival, about 900 years ago, at least 31 species of mammal have established as wild or feral populations in New Zealand. The kiore (Rattus exulans) first arrived with the early Polynesians, and another three species arrived during European settlement between 1770 and 1890. Stoat (Mustela ermine), weasel (M. nivalis) , and ferret (M. furo) were released in the 1880s in an attempt to control rabbits (Orycto-lagus cuniculus). Domestic cats (Felis catus) also arrived in New Zealand as a result of European settlement. The introduction of these species has caused native birds species in New Zealand to dramatically decline. Victoria Forest Park is predominantly made up of beech forest, which are important conservation reserves for endemic birds, and in the summers following heavy seeding of the beech trees, which occurs every 4‚Äì6 years, insect, mouse (Mus musculus), and stoat numbers increase rapidly. When the beech forests experience a high seed year, it results in a population pulse of the house mice which then results in the population pulse of the stoat (King and Powell 2011). When there is an abundance of food available for the stoat, they are able to produce larger litters and with the stoat being the most common mammalian carnivore in South Island beech forests, conservation managers prepare for heavy seedfall as a period of increased conservation hazard in beach forests. In beech forests, mohua, kaka, robins, bellbirds and blue ducks are all at risk of being predated on by stoats post seed fall irruptions Significantly increasing the risk to New Zealand birds is the fact that the majority are hole nesting birds and don‚Äôt possess the predator avoidance mechanisms that other introduced species possess and so they are more vulnerable for the following reasons: * They nest in holes with only one entrance meaning the incubating adult is not able to escape when a predator enters. * Predation results in a biased sex ratio as only the females incubate. * Native birds incubation period is longer than most introduced bird species * Native bird chicks are more noisy on the nest, attracting the attention of predators  Wasps (Vespula spp.) The introduction to New Zealand of the German wasp (Vespula germanica) and the common wasp (Vespula vulgaris) has severely impacted on native New Zealand species. Beech forests of New Zealand, like those of Victoria Forest Park, are infested with scale insects that excrete a sugary secretion. Wasps compete with the native nectar feeding birds and insects, for this sugary secretion, thereby reducing the amount of honeydew that would otherwise be available. Within the beech forests of New Zealand, the biomass of wasps are estimated to be greater than the combined biomass of birds, rodents and stoats and it is estimated that they reduce the honeydew resource by >90% as well as having a major predation impact on native invertebrates.  Possums (Trichosurus vulpecula)  Common brushtail possums significantly impact the native species of the Victoria Forest Park beech forests by competing for nectar, fruit and seed resources. They also remove native birds from their nest sites and eat native bird eggs. However, the population of possums in South Island beech forests is much lower in density compared to that of other types of native forest in New Zealand. Even though they may be at lesser density in beech forests, possums have been found to severely damage mistletoe and have the potential to threaten these plants with local extinction. = Mining = The town of Reefton, located on the western edge of Victoria Forest Park, was founded as a gold and coal mining town in the 1880s. As such, mining relics can still be found throughout the park. Some mining is still being carried out within the Victoria Forest Park. In 1993, GRD Macraes was granted permission for a mine footprint of 107ha and were authorised a pit, tailings dam and a waste rock stack. Since then, the mine footprint has been extended to170ha. GRD Macraes have made numerous other variation applications to increase the scale of the footprint and production which have been refused. In April 2014 the park gained public attention with the Government allowing new oil and gas exploration permits in the park.  Extinctions  Many native animals have suffered range contractions or extinction as a result of the impacts from introduced mammals. Since European settlement and the introduction of mammalian species, native bird species have been severely impacted because of their natural habits making them significantly more vulnerable than other species that have evolved with the same predators. As a result, of these mammalian predators, approximately 49% of New Zealand‚Äôs non-marine endemic birds are extinct. Even through Victoria Forest Park has remained relatively untouched, the native fauna within the park are not excluded from these statistics, and there are a number of species that have gone extinct or are no longer present in the Victoria Park Region. Just a few of these species include: * Yellowhead (m≈çhua) (Mohoua ochrocephala) were once widespread throughout the South Island. The mohua‚Äôs distribution is now restricted to the south of South Island and a few small isolated patches in the north of South Island. It no longer inhabits Victoria Forest Park. * The red-crowned parakeet (Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae) was a common bird throughout the North and South Island but is now virtually extinct on the main islands. It is however common on a number of offshore islands. * The South Island kokako had inhabited the greatest part of South Island up until around the 1880s when its number declined rapidly as a result of the introduction of rats and stoats. It is now thought to be extinct however it is possible that they may survive in low numbers in remote parts of South Island as it was classed as data deficient by the Department of Conservation in 2013 following the acceptance of a sighting near Reefton in 2007.  Management  = Pest Management = The restoration of New Zealand‚Äôs mainland ecological communities has been extremely challenging. The use of aerial and bait station poisoning for rats and possums and kill-trapping of mustelids has been attempted in many mainland forests. This has resulted in increased breeding success of native bird species. Poisoning of stoats rather than trapping has the potential to greatly reduce the cost of controlling stoats as fewer visits to the area are required and because stoats are difficult to trap and it has been identified that secondary poisoning of stoats in South Island beech forest could be an effective means of control. In a study by Alterio (2000) on the use of 1080 and brodifacoum for controlling rodents such as rats and mice, secondary poisoning of stoats and cats was found to be significant and so this could be an especially useful way of restoring New Zealand mainland ecological communities. However, it is necessary that poisoning is carried out in a way that it will not have any impacts on non target native species. = Hunting = No mammal species that has been introduced to New Zealand is afforded any type of protection. Therefore, there are few restrictions on recreational hunting of introduced mammals apart from getting permission of the landowner to gain access to the land. Pest managers see recreational hunting as a reasonably useful control method but recreational hunting tends not to maintain low enough densities of their target species to protect the more vulnerable species.

He has been identified as the first historian of cyber conflict. History Healey was born and raised in Rhode Island, and at 17, joined the United States Air Force. Initially training to be a fighter pilot, Healey transitioned to signals intelligence and in 1998, began working at The Pentagon to implement a computer network defense system. During his Air Force career, Jason was awarded two Meritorious Service Medals based on his contributions in cyber security during his service at the Pentagon. Healey later received a master's degree in Information Security from James Madison University. Work in cyber policy Healey has worked in numerous settings with regard to cyber policy, its implementation, and addressing responses to security threats. In Hong Kong, he served as the vice president for Goldman Sachs where he developed a crisis-response system built to address incidents across the Asian continent. He has also worked at The White House as the Director for Cyber Infrastructure Protection. He is currently a board member on the Cyber Conflict Studies Association and the Military Cyber Professionals Association. The extent of his work has led one magazine to refer to Healey as the first historian of cyber conflict. Frequently, Healey has publicly commented and written articles on high-profile malware threats and cyber policy. For instance, Healey has discussed the potential advantages and disadvantages of the United States launching cyber-based attacks. In regards to such an offensive on Syria, he stated that \\"you no longer have to drop physical bombs and kill people, that it can be targeted, non-lethal microforce\\", but further surmised that due to past leaks of the United States' involvement in Stuxnet, relevant government agencies may have decided against it. Healey has also commented on the Heartbleed bug, noting the failure of the NSA to live up to its stated priority of defense by not exposing the bug when it was found, and he said that the organization would be \\"shredded by the computer security community\\" for this failure. In 2013, Healey also took a critical stance on the current state of mass surveillance in the United States. He predicted that U.S. interests abroad would suffer \\"deep and long term damage\\" given that the administration could not implement any alternatives to spying conducted by the National Security Agency. In 2012, Healey published A Fierce Domain, Cyber Conflict 1986 to 2012, which explores the idea that confrontations that have taken place within cyberspace has established a new kind of conflict. This development is explored historically, starting in 1986 with a hacking initiative planned by the KGB to steal military plans from the U.S. in what is referred to as the Cuckoo's Egg Case. The book received a positive reception and has been referred to as a definitive historical record of cyber conflict. In March 2014, Forbes Magazine identified Healey as one of twenty cyber policy experts to follow on Twitter.

More than 1000 materials, photos and objects displayed in the permanent exhibition show the role the Vietnamese women played in history and currently play in arts and in family life. The museum also organizes thematic exhibitions to show changes and development of the contemporary society. The stated mission of the museum is \\"to enhance public knowledge and understanding of history and cultural heritage of Vietnamese women... thus contributing to promoting gender equality.\\"  History Vietnamese Women‚Äôs Museum was established in 1987, and run is by the Vietnam Women‚Äôs Union. The construction started on an existing building in 1991, according to architect Tran Xuan Diem plans, and opened to the public in 1995. The exhibition presents objects from a large collection (around 28,000 items) gathered by the museum and the Vietnam Women‚Äôs Union since the 1970s. Those artefacts are related to the role of women in family life and history. From 2006 to 2010, the museum was closed for modernisation, with funds from the Vietnamese Government, the Vietnamese Women‚Äôs Union, and the Ford Foundation. The Vietnamese Women‚Äôs Museum reopened to the public in 2010, with a contemporary architecture and modern facilities, and a new permanent exhibition organized around three themes: Women in Family, Women In History and Women‚Äôs Fashion. At the same time, the museum has moved from a cultural and historical museum to a gender museum, providing information on cultural traditions, and issues of social and contemporary life. =Use of museum land for a cafeteria= From 2009 onward, 80m2 of land of the museum in the front of Museum, Ly Thuong Kiet street, has been rented to a cafeteria.

They are classified into special collections such as textiles, metals, wood, paper, pottery, leather, horn, soil, and glass. The objects, which come from all over the country, have been collected by the museum and the Vietnam Women‚Äôs Union since the 1970s. Each of these items belonged to women whose identities are known. They tell their story or reflect on a historical episode that was personally experienced which gives great emotional resonance to the museum. Women in History section = Permanent exhibitions = The permanent exhibition, renovated between 2006 and 2010, is located on the 2nd, the 3rd, and the 4th floors of the museum, and displays around 1000 materials, objects, and photos.  Women in Family  This first theme displays ‚Äúcircle of life‚Äù of Vietnamese women as woman, wife and mother, in the different ethnic groups, which make up the Vietnamese nation. The first part of the exhibition focuses on the role and position of women in their family during the wedding rituals in patrilineal and matrilineal societies. Several objects, such as a gift box for engagement, or a bride‚Äôs costumes, illustrate these rituals. Next, the exhibit introduces the theme of birth: the rituals related to the desire for children, the practice around pregnancy, the birth, and the care of the new mothers and newborn. Finally the exhibit addresses the role and the tasks of women in the everyday life: cultivation, fishing and foraging, preparing meals, pottery, sewing and weaving, and raising children.

The line runs from Mawlamyine Railway Station (Moulmein) to the Dawei area, with connections to Yangon Central Railway Station, it is under construction extending towards Myeik from the current terminus of Thayetchaung Station, which lies just after Dawei Station. Current section in operation includes the part from Mawlamyaing Station to Thayetchaung. It is expected to become a part of a pan-Asian railway network, allowing spur connections specifically to Thailand. A spur connection (95 km as the crow flies) between the SRT rail head at Nam Tok Station in Kanchanaburi Province to Dawei Station through mountains is planned by Thai interests backed by Japanese funding, though other rail connections are certainly possible. Until then, there is an air bridge in the north end with Nok Air flights from Mae Sot Airport, Thailand to Mawlamyaing to bypass rough and politically conflicted overland connections. History 1994 saw the start of construction of the initially isolated Ye-Dawei (Tavoy) railway, completed March 1998. This was later joined to the route north at Ye by the new road/rail bridge across the Ye River, opened November 2003. In April 2008, the tracks were extended across the Thanlwin Bridge, a road/rail bridge located in Moulmein, provision having been made in its design when it was opened a few years earlier. This allowed the long isolated section south to Ye and later Dawei (Tavoy) to receive trains from the north of the country. A 20 mile extension to Thayetchaung Station was opened to traffic in June 2011.

It relates the proportions in which elements combine across a number of different elements. It was first formulated by Jeremias Richter in 1791. A simple statement of the law is:- :If element A combines with element B and also with C, then, if B and C combine together, the proportion by weight in which they do so will be simply related to the weights of B and C which separately combine with a constant weight of A. :As an example, 1 gram of sodium (Na = A) is observed to combine with either 1.54 grams of chlorine (Cl = B) or 5.52 grams of iodine (I = C). (These ratios correspond to the modern formulas NaCl and NaI). The ratio of these two weights is 5.52/1.54 = 3.58. It is also observed that 1 gram of chlorine reacts with 1.19 g of iodine. This ratio of 1.19 obeys the law because it is a simple fraction (1/3) of 3.58. (This is because it corresponds to the formula ICl3, which is one known compound of iodine and chlorine.) Similarly, hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen follow the law of reciprocal proportions. The acceptance of the law allowed tables of element equivalent weights to be drawn up. These equivalent weights were widely used by chemists in the 19th century. The other laws of stoichiometry are the law of definite proportions and the law of multiple proportions. The law of definite proportions refers to the fixed composition of any compound formed between element A and element B. The law of multiple proportions describes the stoichiometric relationship between two or more different compounds formed between element A and element B. History The law of reciprocal proportions was proposed in essence by Richter, following his determination of neutralisation ratios of metals with acids. In the early 19th century it was investigated by Berzelius, who formulated it as follows: :When two substances, A and B have an affinity for two others, C and D, the ratio of the quantities C and D which saturate the same amount of A is the same as that between the quantities C and D which saturate the same amount of B. Later Jean Stas showed that within experimental error the stoichiometric laws were correct.

As early as 1906 he had completed a mansion, known as Lynton, at 4 Clarence Street, Burwood. The house is now listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register. Its design is an ornately idiosyncratic version of the architecture of the Federation period. The complexity of the multi-gabled roof line makes the house a landmark in the district. It contains a ballroom, and has separate stables and a fernery on its original curtilage. In 1908 he started doing design work for Arnott's Biscuits. He built four brick cottages next to the factory at Homebush and extensive brick stabling and wagon-sheds. Marriage Rickard married Ruby Charlotte Chaseling (1887‚Äì1965) on 2 March 1912 at Wesley Church, Redfern. At the wedding reception Rickard presented his new wife with the deeds to a new home in Strathfield.

He is known for publications on particle physics, quantum field theory, General Relativity, philosophy of science, and for his graduate texts on classical electrodynamics and theory of spinors.  Biography  Yuri Yappa was born in Leningrad, USSR in the family of doctor Andrei Yappa (, ). In 1941, because of the German invasion in the Soviet Union and the Siege of Leningrad he had to interrupt his regular education and to start working.

In parallel with the work in the hospital, he continued his self-education, so that in 1944 he passed exams for the entire course of the school and started to study at the Physical Faculty of the Leningrad University. During the winter of 1944-1945 he with a few other students alternated their studies with a work as stokers in the University's boiler- house. Yuri Yappa also started to work at the laboratory of molecular physics, but later, following an advice of its head Viktor Tsvetkov, joined a theoretical physics group. In 1949 he graduated from the Leningrad University, then continued postgraduate studies there at the Chair of Theoretical Physics headed by Vladimir Fock. Since then Yuri Yappa was the nearest collaborator of Vladimir Fock till the death of the latter in 1974.  Academic career  In 1953 Yuri Yappa earned his PhD () degree with a thesis on the relativistic theory of elementary particles. Yuri Yappa in 1957. In 1954‚Äì1956, he led a group of theoreticians at the Institute of Nuclear Problems of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in Dubna (Moscow Region). His group worked on the theory of elementary particles and provided theoretical explanation of experimental results on proton scattering. In the same period he also edited two collective monographs in the series \\"Problems of Modern Physics\\". In 1956 the Institute of Nuclear Problems was united with the Electrophysical Laboratory of Vladimir Veksler in Dubna to form the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, and Yuri Yappa continued to work in this new institution. However, owing to personal circumstances, he discontinued the work in Dubna and in 1957 started to work at the Chair of Theoretical Physics of the Physical Faculty of the Leningrad University. After the chair had split, in the 1970s‚Äì1990s he continued at the Chair of the Theory of Nucleus and Elementary Particles (nowadays the Chair of High Energy and Elementary Particle PhysicsSite of the Chair of High Energy and Elementary Particle Physics of the Saint-Petersburg State University). Yuri Yappa was a senior research scientist () since 1956 and an assistant professor () since 1968. He published over 40 papers on quantum field theory, General Relativity, mathematics, and philosophy of science.  Scientific work and teaching  Yuri Yappa led a number of theoretical courses in the Leningrad/St.-Petersburg University, including his well-known courses of General Relativity, which was passed to him by Vladimir Fock in 1958, and of classical electrodynamics, which served the base of his graduate book (coauthored by Viktor Novozhilov) Electrodynamics, whose revised edition was published and republished in English. His graduate text on the theory of spinors was finished by his University colleagues and published posthumously.

The Royal Norwegian Air Force aircraft of No. 333 Squadron RNoAF (333 Sqn) was conducting a postal drop flight from Troms√∏ to five settlements on Svalbard, including Bj√∏rn√∏ya Radio, making a low pass over Bj√∏rn√∏ya at a height of before crashing into the ground. Only one of the nine on board survived. The crew at the station set out to find the aircraft in of snow, and did not manage to bring the survivor back to the station until the following day. Four military ships were dispatched to search for the aircraft. Once it was found, Andenes and S√∏r√∏y returned to Troms√∏ and then took the investigation commission to Bj√∏rn√∏ya. They concluded that the accident was caused by the aircraft losing altitude through a sideslip, possibly due to the pilot losing spatial awareness in the poor visibility. Background Svalbard had since its settlement in the early 20th century been entirely isolated from the world during winter, when ice closed its ports. As a trial, the air force carried out a postal delivery expedition in April 1949, dropping mail at Longyearbyen, Ny-√Ölesund and Sveagruva. Another flight was carried out the following year, with two more in 1951. The services continued with increasing frequency throughout the 1950s. The aircraft was a Boeing-Canada PB2B-1 Catalina IVB--a version of the Consolidated PBY Catalina--with construction number 28129 and the Squadron code of KK-N. It was built in 1944 for the United States Navy. The aircraft was sold to Norway after the Second World War ended. It was bought by Vingtor Luftveier of Oslo and registered as LN-OAP on 2 June 1947. The RNoAF bought the aircraft on 15 September 1948. It was originally given the squadron code K-AN, which was later changed to KK-N. The aircraft was part of No. 333 Squadron based at Sola Air Station. Flight and crash The flight was a postal delivery flight which was to drop mail at six Norwegian settlements and outposts in Svalbard. The flight plan was to take a load of post from Troms√∏ Airport, Skatt√∏ra and fly a route to drop it at Bj√∏rn√∏ya Radio, Isfjord Radio, Longyearbyen, Ny-√Ölesund, Hopen Radio and then fly back via Bj√∏rn√∏ya. The flight had an estimated duration of sixteen hours. It had been delayed for several days because of bad weather. The aircraft was prepared for the flight on 27 March. A Catalina similar to the accident aircraft The aircraft had a crew of eight: three pilots, two navigators, two radio operators and a mechanic. The same crew had been attached to the aircraft and flown it together the past 20 months. In addition there was a passenger, a journalist from the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation, who was making a radio program about the flight. Originally the broadcaster had appointed Jan Frydenlund to the task, but when it became clear that the flight would be delayed by several days he was replaced by local radio journalist Sigvart Tingvoll. The aircraft departed Skatt√∏ra on 28 March at 01:55. The flight went as planned, with the post being dropped at Bj√∏rn√∏ya and all the other settlements. The surviving crewmember reported that the residents of the various settlements greeted the aircraft enthusiastically at all locations. The weather was generally poor, with low-laying rainclouds. However, there were clear spots in between the clouds which provided pockets of good sight. On the return leg from Hopen the aircraft followed a route via Bj√∏rn√∏ya, approaching the island from the northeast. At 14:57 it passed at low altitude just west of the station, while it retained radio contact. Minutes later the station lost contact with the aircraft, although the operators there simply presumed that the aircraft's radio had stopped working--a common occurrence at the time. The aircraft was flying at an altitude of only above the ground over Bj√∏rn√∏ya. While passing the radio operator on the Catalina had made contact with Bj√∏rn√∏ya Radio. He had attempted to make contact again just before impact, which was thought by the investigation commission to be possibly because the crew had discovered something wrong with the aircraft. This possible problem may have been the cause of the accident. The impact took place south of the station, when the tip of the right wing hit the ground and subsequently the aircraft crashed into the ground in an explosion. The landscape at the accident site is completely flat. The investigation commission concluded that the accident was caused by the aircraft losing altitude, falling into a sideslip and descending into the ground, first hitting it with the right wingtip. The cause of loss of altitude was unknown, but could either have been part of a sideways banking maneuver or uncontrolled. The varying weather with pockets of good and poor visibility led the commission to believe that the aircraft could have flown into an area with fog and lost sight of the horizon. It reported that the accident took place towards the end of a very long flight and that fatigue could have reduced the pilots' faculties. This could be a decisive pivoting factor in the narrow margins while maneuvering at such low altitudes. The commission found no signs of technical error on the aircraft. It also commented that flying at low altitudes over the sea was common because of the lower wind speeds. The only person to survive the crash was Paul Olsen, one of the two radio operators. He was sitting in the aircraft's rear in one of the Catalina's side blisters. Upon impact he was ejected from the aircraft. Olsen stated that he did not recall anything from the accident and that he initially was unconscious. After waking up he tried calling to the other crew members. He then tried to walk around, but the pain in his foot made this impossible. The aircraft was still on fire and he dared not approach it. Because of the aircraft's poor insulation, Olsen was wearing a leather jacket and a sheepskin sweater, which kept him warm until he was rescued. Rescue and investigation The RNoAF initiated rescue preparedness three-quarters of an hour after estimated time of arrival to Skatt√∏ra. A distress signal alert was issued by the air traffic control at Skatt√∏ra at 18:20. A Catalina was dispatched in a search and rescue mission. It flew the route from Troms√∏ to Bj√∏rn√∏ya and back that evening. Four Royal Norwegian Navy ships, Andenes and S√∏r√∏y and two minesweepers, were dispatched to participate in the operation. Other ships participating in the search were G. O. Sars and . Allied Forces Northern Europe at Kols√•s was alerted and assistance was initiated from the US Third Air Force and the RAF Coastal Command, which were due to arrive at Bod√∏ Main Air Station the following morning. Aerial view of Bj√∏rn√∏ya The distress call was received by the crew at Bj√∏rn√∏ya Radio and they decided to send two men, Einar Strand and Alv Alv√¶r, to look for the aircraft on the island. After an hour of searching in one meter (3 ft) deep snow, the two spotted the aircraft, which they quickly identified as they saw flames. They arrived three hours after the accident and found Olsen. Strand and Alv√¶r attempted to drag the survivor with them, but this proved too strenuous. Instead Alv√¶r went back to the station and Strand stayed with Olsen. On the return trip Alv√¶r got lost at one time, but finally managed to reach the station. Bj√∏rn√∏ya Radio contacted Skatt√∏ra at 21:45 reporting that the wreck had been found. Strand built an ad hoc sled out of his skis and attempted to drag Olsen on it. It was difficult as Strand was forced to put down his backpack, drag the sled a distance and then return to walk back to bring forth the backpack. As he could not wear his skis, it was a strenuous exercise. The hauling proved futile, and instead Strand decided to return to the station for help. He left his flashlight with Olsen so that he could find him again, although even with this aid relocating the stranded survivor proved difficult, as this part of Bj√∏rn√∏ya is flat and there were no visual references to help orient the searchers. Strand did not return until morning, and Olsen was getting wetter and colder as he waited for help. In the end Olsen decided that further help would not come in time and started following Strand's footsteps, but he soon had to give up, having traversed about . Three of the four crew at the station returned and transported Olsen to safety. (As the station needed to remain manned at all times, one of the crew was forced to stay behind.) Olsen reached the station at 13:00 on 29 March. And√∏ya and S√∏r√∏y were recalled back to Troms√∏. There they were attached to the investigation commission, led by Major Anonsen. He was assisted by two pilots, a technical officer, a medical doctor and a police officer. Most of the commission was transported by S√∏r√∏y, while further supplies and eight coffins were sent by Andenes. S√∏r√∏y arrived at Bj√∏rn√∏ya at 23:00 on 29 March, while Andenes arrived on 30 March. Also aboard was a contingent of fifty conscripts who stayed in Bj√∏rn√∏ya for five days. The commission started its work by investigating the wreck and removing the bodies. The deceased were transported to Troms√∏, arriving at 13:30 on 1 April. There was a common memorial service at Troms√∏ before the deceased were transported to their respective hometowns for burial. Aftermath The accident was the 333 Squadron's third fatal accident with the Catalinas. It was the first aviation accident in Svalbard and remained the deadliest aviation accident of a civilian nature in the territory until Vnukovo Airlines Flight 2801 in 1996, which killed 141 people. The air force continued on the postal service until 1959. By then a winter airport had been built in Adventdalen outside Longyearbyen and Braathens SAFE took over the postal flights. A memorial plaque with a part of the aircraft's propeller was erected at the station at Bj√∏rn√∏ya on 1 November 1984. The 333 Squadron commemorated the accident on its 50th anniversary in 2004 by flying two Lockheed P-3 Orion aircraft over Bj√∏rn√∏ya and dropping flowers over the site. The wreckage has never been cleaned up and is still located at the crash site.

Signs and symptoms Clinically and radiologically the disease is characterized by severe shortening of long bones (limb's both proximal and median segments are affected), aplasia or severe hypoplasia of ulna and fibula, thickened and curved radius and tibia. These anomalies can cause deformities of the hands and feet. Hypoplasia of the mandible can also be present. Pathogenesis At the core of the disorder there is a homozygous or compound heterozygous mutation or deletion of the SHOX (Short Stature Homeobox), SHOXY (Short Stature Homeobox Y-linked) or PAR1 (where SHOX enhancer elements are located) genes, which is inherited in a pseudosomal recessive manner. Diagnosis Diagnosis may be suspected on the basis of the clinical and radiologic findings, and can supported by molecular analysis of the SHOX, SHOXY and PAR1 genes. May also be suspected by ultrasound during the second trimester of gestation. =Classification= It's part of the mesomelic and rhizomelic skeletal dysplasias, primary bone diseases in which the short stature is due to a lack of complete bone development of the limb's long bones.

Since at least the 1980s, kidnapping has become a bigger issue than ever in the country. Since the 1990s, tougher laws against the kidnapping have been established. Chinese authorities have also investigated in this regard. History Ancient Chinese text indicates the ransoming of hostages during the reign of Xia Dynasty (2070 BC - 1600 BC), they refer to the taking of princes and family members as hostages across the multiple dynastic periods as warrantor of negotiated treaties. There have been number of historical incidents of kidnapping in China, In 1523, when two Japanese rival delegations had arrived in Ningbo, they had looted and kidnapped Chinese civil servants. Due to such incident, the official relations with Japan were not restored until 1539. During the Second Opium War, when an estimated of 18,000 British and French Soldiers had returned to the coastal forts, Chinese' response included the kidnapping of 38 Anglo-French negotiating party members, 26 of them died in captivity. During World War II, thousands of Chinese were kidnapped by the Japanese and sent to Japan to work as forced laborers. Many Chinese were forced to work in deadly conditions at coal mines in Kyushu and Honshu. In 2015, the Chinese government launched QGDGXQ, a system for identifying and reuniting freed children. As of 2018, the Chinese government has notoriously kidnapped and imprisoned prominent businessmen including Yang Zhihui, Wu Xiaohui and Guo Guangchang. This is part of the crackdown on \\"market manipulation\\" yet critics condemn the actions of the Chinese government stating that they are breaking UN human rights regulations and censoring the freedom of speech in China. Studies During the 19th century, Johannes Von Gumpach had described the issue of kidnapping as \\"One of the most common crimes in China.\\" According to Francis Dunlap Gamewell, kidnapping was a common crime in Shanghai; he noted that kidnappers were mostly female. Carl Crow, who traveled to China during the wars, he had described the prevalence of kidnapping in China as \\"well organized business in China carried out with a large degree of success\\". Prevalence Kidnapping has become a growing business in China. Steve Vickers of Kroll Associates has reportedly noted that some common scenarios of kidnapping in China includes the kidnapping for ransom, kidnapping of a foreigner(commonly in Hong Kong or Macau). =Child abductions= An estimated 70,000 children are kidnapped in China every year, although the Chinese government reported fewer than 10,000 kidnappings. According to the United States Department of State, estimates are closer to 20,000. Some children are reported to have been sold into adoption overseas. The adoption agencies of China receive considerable donations from foreign parents when they adopt, sometimes as much as $5,000; such agencies have been known to purchase children from human traffickers, although such cases are usually rare. =Kidnapping of foreign businessmen= In Guangdong, during the year 1994, the \\"economic crimes\\" topped the list of criminal cases, about 46 debt related hosted cases were acknowledged and investigated by the authorities. The chief procurator, Wang Jun had noted that at least 171 hostages involved in debt-related incidents had been freed by the authorities of Guangdong. Crackdown From the period of 1991 to 1996, Chinese police freed an estimated 88,000 kidnapped women and children. During this period, about 143,000 kidnappers were arrested. In 2011, Chinese police asserted that they rescued over 13,000 children and 23,000 women in the last two years. Government officials had noted that they would impose harsher punishments on those who purchase kidnapped children. In September 2013, Chinese security forces had rescued 92 children, and arrested 301 suspected kidnappers. According to a report from October 2013, Beijing has tried to combat kidnappings. According to Xinhua news agency, since 2009, police have rescued over 54,000 children and eliminated 11,000 traffickers. Law Kidnapping is illegal in China. By 1991, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress addressed for acting against the kidnapping for sale of women and children, kidnapping for blackmailing, purchase of abducted women and children, as well as the abuse of office to inhibit the rescue of kidnapped women and children.Vitit Muntarbhorn, The Nation. Bangkok; Section: Editorial Date: 1/7/98 Such concerns led to the familiarization of a criminal law. Per Article 141, penalties for the abduction, purchase, sale, and trafficking of women and children have taken place. Later in 1997, the penalties were increased.

History In 1997, five local school districts met with members of the Central Susquehanna Intermediate Unit (CSIU16) to discuss establishing a cyber entity. Three of the original five school districts approved the charter that created the SusQ-Cyber Charter School in 1998 (Berwick Area School District, Bloomsburg Area School District and Milton Area School District). In 2002, Pennsylvania Act 88 required all charter schools to be chartered by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. The overriding focus was for the school to deliver an educational program to primarily at-risk high school students who are trying to obtain their high school diploma. In 2003, the SusQ-Cyber Charter School was re-chartered as a public school district for grades 9-12 for an additional 5 years. For its first five years, the school was open exclusively to students in the CSIU16 region. In 2005, enrollment opened to all Pennsylvania students who meets the residence and age requirements of Pennsylvania law. Initially, the school provided courses that were not available in their traditional district's high school. Over time the program has evolved to serve students who are underserved by the traditional local public schools. This includes students who are pregnant and students who need to work to support themselves, for example. Other students have medical problems such as auto-immune deficiency, cancer, or asthma that lead to them missing a significant number of schools days, due to illness or therapy appointments. Another group of students are gifted. They seek cyber school after leaving their traditional school to accelerate their studies. They may have entered college with advanced standing, but have a course requirement outstanding to earn their high school diploma. Some public school principals have reported referring potential drop out to the school to finish their public education and earn a high school diploma.Susq-Cyber Charter School, Susq-Cyber Charter School Annual report, November 2008 Graduation rate In 2017, Susq-Cyber Charter School ‚Äôs graduation rate increased to 29.82%.PDE, Graduation rate by LEA, 2017 *2016 - declined to 25%.PDE, Graduation rate by LEA, 2016 *2015 - 32.86% *2014 - 28.5% *2013 - 31.5%Pennsylvania Department of Education, Susq-Cyber Charter School Academic Performance Profile 2013, October 4, 2013 *2012 - 31.5%Pennsylvania Department of Education, Susq-Cyber Charter School AYP Data table 2012, September 21, 2012 *2011 - 32% *2010 - 27.3%Local School Directory, Susq-Cyber Charter School, 2014 In 2008, Susq- Cyber Charter School reported graduating 47 students.

The total number of required credits to graduate was set at 22.5 credits. Electives required include 2 credits in the arts and the humanities plus 2.5 additional credits. health and Physical Education remained at 1.5 credits and .5 credit for the graduation project course. By law, all Pennsylvania secondary school students were required to complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district. Effective with the graduating class of 2017, the Pennsylvania State Board of Education eliminated the state mandate that students complete a culminating project in order to graduate.Pennsylvania State Board of Education, Proposed changes to Chapter 4, May 10, 2012 By Pennsylvania State School Board regulations, beginning with the class of 2020, public school students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, and English Literature by passing the respective Keystone Exams for each course. The exam is given at the end of the course. Keystone Exams have replaced the PSSAs for 11th grade. Students have several opportunities to pass the Keystone Exams. Schools are mandated to provide targeted assistance to help the student be successful. Those who do not pass after several attempts can perform a project in order to graduate. The original intent was to gradually add seven more exams including civics and geometry. In 2017, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed legislation that eliminated developing any more Keystone Exams in other subjects.PA General Assembly, Act 6 of 2017, June 21, 2017 In 2011, Pennsylvania high school students field tested the Algebra 1, Biology and English Lit exams. The statewide results were: Algebra 1 38% on grade level, Biology 35% on grade level and English Lit - 49% on grade level. Individual student, school or district reports were not made public, although they were reported to district officials by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Students identified as having special needs and qualifying for an Individual Educational Program (IEP) may graduate by meeting the requirements of their IEP. School district superintendents have the discretion to graduate up to 10% of pupils who do not pass the exams or project.

The Center for Rural Pennsylvania, a research arm of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, compared the SAT data of students in rural areas of Pennsylvania to students in urban areas. From 2003 to 2005, the average total SAT score for students in rural Pennsylvania was 992, while urban students averaged 1,006. During the same period, 28 percent of 11th and 12th graders in rural school districts took the exam, compared to 32 percent of urban students in the same grades. The average math and verbal scores were 495 and 497, respectively, for rural students, while urban test-takers averaged 499 and 507, respectively. Pennsylvania's SAT composite score ranked low on the national scale in 2004. The composite SAT score of 1,003 left Pennsylvania ranking 44 out of the 50 states and Washington, DC. AP Courses SusQ Cyber Charter School does not offer AP courses to its pupils. Tuition rate Charter and Cyber Charter Schools are funded with state and local education funds through a tuition rate at 70-80% of a traditional public school funding. In 2011, Berwick Area School District paid $9,792.91 per pupil in tuition for pupils attending Pennsylvania public charter schools and, including Susq-Cyber Charter School. The district's per-pupil spending was reported as $11,209.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Tuition rate by LEA 2011, 2011 Bloomsburg Area School District paid $8,924.30 per pupil in tuition for pupils attending charter schools.

The district's internal per- pupil spending was $12,204.50 (2010). For special education students, the charter school receives for each student enrolled the same funding as for each non-special education student, plus an additional amount determined by dividing the district of residence's total special education expenditure by the product of multiplying the combined percentage of the special education payment times the district of residence's total average daily membership for the prior school year. The By-laws of SusQ-Cyber Charter School contained a provision that excess funds from tuition may be returned to the school districts based on their contributions. In 2002, the Charter School returned $225,025.74 to the sending districts.James Street SusQ-Cyber Charter School Administration, SusQ-Cyber Charter School Charter Renewal Application, June 16, 2003 Health The school employs a part-time school nurse who maintains student health records including mandated immunization and screenings and makes mandated reports to the Pennsylvania Department of Education and Pennsylvania Department of Health. The nurse coordinates the required 11th grade physical examinations. Since the students do not physically attend school at the offices of the Cyber School the nurse must coordinate and schedule physical examinations and the yearly height, weight, vision, and hearing screenings for students and arrange for the school doctor to conduct physicals. Parents utilize the family physician to meet the 11th grade physical examination requirement. Alternatively, the SusQ-Cyber Charter School has contracted with Geisinger Health Systems for school physician services to conduct 11th grade physicals.SusQ-Cyber Charter School administration, Student Handbook Health Policy, 2003 Beginning with the 2017‚Äì18 school year, high school students are mandated to receive a dose of MCV meningococcal conjugate vaccine for 12th grade entry.

Isaac Ross (1760-1836) was an American Revolutionary War veteran and planter from South Carolina who developed Prospect Hill Plantation in Jefferson County, Mississippi, for cotton cultivation. He owned thousands of acres and nearly 160 slaves by 1820. In 1830 Ross was among the major donors and founders of Oakland College, a Presbyterian-affiliated school for young men near Lorman, Mississippi, which operated from 1830 to 1870. After sale to the state that year, it was renamed by the Reconstruction era-state legislature as Alcorn College and designated as a land-grant university, the first land grant institution for blacks in the United States. Influenced by war ideals and the American Colonization Society, Ross was among the founders of the Mississippi Colonization Society. Its goal was to repatriate (or transport) freed slaves and free people of color to Africa in order to get them out of the South, where planters believed they threatened slave societies. In 1835 Ross wrote a will to free his hundreds of African-American slaves (who were overwhelmingly US native-born). It ordered the sale of his plantation to generate revenue to fund the transport of the freed slaves to Mississippi-in-Africa, the state's colony in what became Liberia in coastal West Africa. The Mississippi Colonization Society had purchased land there. In 1847 it became part of the Commonwealth of Liberia. Biography =Early life= Isaac Ross was born on January 18, 1760 in North Carolina.

By 1818, after Mississippi became a state, he owned 3,881 acres of land and 133 slaves; 158 slaves in 1820; and 4,240 acres of land and 113 slaves in 1830. By 1828, he also owned several other plantations and more slaves. Shortly before his death, Ross owned around 5,000 acres of land, 160 slaves, and had an estimated wealth of US$100,000. In 1830, Ross was one of the financial supporters of Oakland College in Lorman, Mississippi, a Presbyterian college whose president was minister Jemeriah Chamberlain.Mary Carol Miller, Must See Mississippi: 50 Favorite Places, Oxford, Mississippi: University Press of Mississippi, 2007, pp. 41-44 In the 1830s, together with Chamberlain and three other planters, Edward McGehee, Stephen Duncan, and John Ker, Ross co-founded the Mississippi Colonization Society. Like the American Colonization Society, its goal was to relocate free blacks and newly freed slaves to the American colony of Liberia in West Africa in order to remove them from American society, particularly from the slave societies of the South.Dale Edwyna Smith, The Slaves of Liberty: Freedom in Amite County, Mississippi, 1820-1868, Routledge, 2013, pp. 15-21 The organization was focused on slaves freed in Mississippi, where slaves outnumbered whites by a ratio of three-to-one. These major slaveholders believed that free blacks threatened the stability of American society, and that transporting freed slaves to Africa might be a long-term solution. =Personal life= Ross married Jane Brown (1762-1829). They had two sons and three daughters: *Margaret Allison Ross Reed (1787-1838). Her second husband was Thomas Buck Reed (1787‚Äì1829), who served as United States Senator from Mississippi from January 28, 1826 to March 4, 1827, and again from March 4, 1829 to November 26, 1829. *Martha B. Ross (1793-1818). *Alison Ross (1803-1834). *Isaac Ross (1796-1852). *Arthur Alison (1801-1834). He married Octavia Van Dorn, daughter of Earl Van Dorn (1820‚Äì1863), an officer who served as a general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War of 1861-1865. Widowed when her husband Alison died, in 1837 Octavia married Dr Vans Murray Sulivane (1810-1840); they had a son, Clement Sullivane (1838-1920), who served in the Confederate States Army during the Civil War. He was later elected as a member of the Maryland Senate. Ross was widowed in 1829. Around the same period that he lost his wife, their daughter and a son- in-law, and two Ross sons also died. =Death and legacy= Ross died on January 19, 1836 in Jefferson County, Mississippi. He was buried in the cemetery at Prospect Hill Plantation. It later became known as the Wade Family Cemetery after his grandson Isaac Ross Wade reacquired the plantation in the 1850s, building a new mansion and living on the grounds. Ross freed his slaves in his will, ordering the sale of his plantation to raise funds in order to pay for their transport to Liberia and provide them with a stake to get necessary supplies for their new lives.Alan Huffman, Mississippi in Africa: The Saga of the Slaves of Prospect Hill Plantation and Their Legacy in Liberia Today (2010), Project Muse, text online The will stipulated that those slaves who chose not to emigrate to Africa should be sold to the highest bidder, with the proceeds invested to go to the American Colonization Society to build a new university in Liberia for the colonists and support it for 100 years. Ross added the caveat that slave families could not be separated. A memorial obelisk to Isaac Ross stands at his gravesite in the cemetery at Prospect Hill Plantation. Ross and other supporters of such colonization referred to freed slaves being \\"repatriated\\" to Africa, but by this time, most slaves were overwhelmingly American born, and had been for generations. In the North most free blacks did not want to leave the United States but to improve their treatment and gain civil rights here. They expressed considerable opposition to the program of the American Colonization Society, but thousands of free blacks did migrate as pioneers to Liberia. Of Ross' 160 registered slaves at Prospect Hill Plantation, 123 chose to be freed and emigrate to Africa. (Five were prohibited from leaving.) Other freed slaves were added from other plantations, making a group of nearly 300. Ross' grandson Isaac Ross Wade contested the will for nearly a decade, as the estate was used to fund the migration. In 1842 Mississippi passed a law prohibiting the manumission of slaves by will, and prohibiting removal of slaves from the state for the purpose of manumission. But perhaps legislators had not envisioned 'repatriation' for the purpose of manumission, as the Ross will was upheld in 1845 by the Supreme Court of Mississippi. There were additional technicalities that delayed the freedmen's departure. During this period, they worked under the authority of Isaac Ross Wade at Prospect Hill Plantation, with the stipulation that they were technically free and would be paid for their time. Map of Liberia in the 1830s, where the Mississippi and other state-sponsored colonies are identified. Finally traveling from Natchez, Mississippi by ship, the Prospect Hill freedmen reached Liberia in two groups in 1848. They settled in what came to be known as Mississippi-in-Africa, on land purchased by the Mississippi Colonization Society. Most of them could read and write, and were likely among the elite household staff and artisans among slaves. Many corresponded with Wade and members of his family, as well as representatives of the MCS, in an attempt to gain supplies they desperately needed. They also sought to have the Wade family pay them what they were owed for three years' work - an estimated $100,000. They were met mostly with silence; in one letter the Wade family told them their board and court expenses had been charged to the money they were owed, and that in fact they were in debt to the family. The letters from the African Americans reported the high fatalities their group suffered, with many dying in the first year or so of \\"African fever.\\" Neither the Wade family nor the ACS ever followed through on their obligations to the settlers; no university in Liberia was endowed or established from Ross' funds. In Mississippi in Africa: The Saga of the Slaves of Prospect Hill Plantation and Their Legacy in Liberia Today (revised edition, 2010), author Alan Huffman argues that tensions introduced by the development of this colony (and the larger influence of Americo-Liberians in the country) created longstanding resentments among the indigenous tribesmen. In addition, the Americo-Liberians repressed the native peoples and assumed their own superiority, in a colonial manner. They created a society with inequities that Huffman believes strongly contributed to the First Liberian Civil War of 1989-1996 more than a century later, and to the Second Liberian Civil War of 1999-2003. Because the Americo-Liberians dominated the country politically and economically into the 20th century, suppressing the native tribes, there was great resentment against them among the indigenous peoples. The Americo- Liberians treated the native tribes as inferior to them, much as they had been treated by whites in the United States.

It consists of an obelisk flanked by two colonnades in the form of Greek temples. Outside the colonnades are memorial gardens, each containing a Pool of Remembrance and fountains. The memorial was designed by the local architects Grayson and Barnish, and the carving was executed by Herbert Tyson Smith. It was unveiled in 1923 by the Earl of Derby. Following the Second World War and subsequent conflicts further inscriptions and names have been added. The memorial is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History As a result of a meeting on 14 February 1919 a War Memorial Committee was established to raise money by public subscription for a monument, to extend the hospital, and to provide grants for bereaved children. The monument was to be sited in London Square as part of a scheme to remodel the centre of the town. A total of ¬£31,854 was raised, and a competition was launched for the design of the monument. Reginald Blomfield was appointed as adviser and assessor of the competition. The first prize was given to the Liverpool partnership of Grayson and Barnish. The original designs did not specifically include any sculpture, and concern was expressed about this, leading to the appointment of Herbert Tyson Smith as sculptor. The initial tenders for building the memorial were considered to be too high, and after a second set of tenders W. Moss and Son were commissioned as main contractors. Following some delays in its construction, the memorial was unveiled on 18 November 1923 by the Earl of Derby. Following the Second World War, an additional inscription was designed by Barnish and executed by Tyson Smith; this was unveiled on 28 October 1956. At the same time fountains were installed in the Pools of Remembrance. In 1992 plaques were added containing the names of those lost in the Second World War, and later the names of those who have died as a result of later conflicts have been added. Description The memorial consists of an obelisk, two colonnades, and gardens. The colonnades and obelisk are constructed in Portland stone, the sculpture and lettered panels are in Meuriel marble, and the Second World War inscription is in Hopton Wood stone. The obelisk stands in the centre of a traffic island, with the colonnades to the northeast and southwest, and the gardens beyond them. =Obelisk= Obelisk The obelisk is high and stands on a square pedestal and base. There are carved roundels on three faces of the obelisk. That on the northwest face contains a wreath and the inscription: LOOK UPWARD STANDING MUTE. SALUTE On the base below this are inscribed the dates \\"MCMXIV‚ÄìMCMXVIII\\". The northeast face is plain. On the southeast face are the coat of arms of Southport and the inscription: SALUS POPULI The roundel on the southwest face was added in 1956. It was designed by Barnish, carved by Tyson Smith, and contains the following inscription: TO THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THIS COUNTY BOROUGH WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES FOR THE LIBERTY OF THE WORLD AND THE SECURITY OF THIS REALM IN THE WORLD WAR 1939‚Äì1945 THEIR NAMES ARE RECORDED IN THE BOOK OF REMEMBRANCE WHICH LIES NEARBY IN THE KEEPING OF CHRIST CHURCH THE FOUNTAINS ADDED TO THE MEMORIAL POOLS ARE DEDICATED TO THEIR HONOURED MEMORY =Colonnades= Northeast colonnade The colonnades are similar to each other, but have different carvings, inscriptions and contents. They are in the style of Greek temples, symmetrical with a rectangular plan, are in a single storey, and have flat roofs. On each side there are four pairs of fluted Doric columns forming an open colonnade of five bays. At each end is an enclosed cenotaph with an entablature containing inscriptions, and with two open windows above which are carved panels. There are also carved panels and inscriptions on the ends of the colonnades. At the entrances to the cenotaphs are fluted Ionic columns, and inside the ceilings are coffered. At the centre of each cenotaph is a pedestal altar, and on the walls are marble tablets containing the names of the engagements in the First World War, regimental badges, and the names of the dead and their rank arranged by regiment and unit. The names are of those who were lost in both World Wars and in later conflicts. Adjacent to the colonnades, and surrounding the obelisk, are cast iron lamp stands that were cast by the Bromsgrove Guild. They have fluted columns, and their bases are decorated with acanthus leaves. Northeast colonnade The entablature on the side facing the obelisk is inscribed with: TELL BRITAIN YE WHO MARK THIS MONUMENT and on the side facing the garden is: THEIR PORTION IS WITH THE ETERNAL On the northwest face of the colonnade is a panel carved with a depiction of Britannia holding a statuette of Victory. Facing the garden is a platform with the following inscription: THEY DIED THAT WE MIGHT LIVE WE LIVE ONLY AS WE SAFEGUARD THE IDEALS FOR WHICH THEY DIED FREEDOM JUSTICE MERCY SO LET US LIVE THAT WE MAY SHARE WITH THEM THE LIFE ETERNAL The altar in the northwest cenotaph is carved with representations of Patroclus and Achilles. On the wall is a tablet inscribed with: FOR THE SACRED CAUSE OF JUSTICE Southwest colonnade On the side of the entablature facing the obelisk is the inscription: FAITHFUL TO HER WE FELL AND REST CONTENT and on the side facing the garden is: TO FAMOUS MEN ALL EARTH IS SEPULCHRE The panel on the northwest side of the colonnade depicts Britannia offering a tribute to the dead and represents \\"Mourning\\". On the northeast side is a panel inscribed: REMEMBER THAT THE MEN WHOSE NAMES LIVE ON THESE WALLS DIED IN YOUTH OR PRIME THAT FUTURE GENERATIONS MIGHT INHERIT A HAPPIER WORLD AND A HUMAN SOCIETY MORE RIGHTEOUS AND MORE LOVING THAN THOSE BRAVE MEN AND THEIR GENERATION KNEW The altar in the southwest cenotaph is carved with a representation of \\"Death and the Soldier\\". There are two inscribed tablets. One reads: ALL THAT THEY HAD THEY GAVE and the other is inscribed with: THEIR NAME LIVETH =Gardens= Southwest Memorial Garden with Pool of Remembrance and fountains Outside each colonnade is a Memorial Garden. In the centre of each is a long rectangular Pool of Remembrance containing three fountains. The pool is surrounded by flat copings in Portland stone, and at the colonnade end of the pool is a low curved parapet with a spout in the form of a lion's head. The pool is flanked by lawns, outside which is balustrading in Portland stone. Appraisal The war memorial was designated as a listed building on 15 November 1972, and was graded at II* on 5 March 2010. Grade II* listing is granted to \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\". In the reasons given for listing at this grade it is stated that the memorial forms \\"a highly striking, powerful and reverential war memorial assemblage\\" and it provides \\"a sense of dignity and atmosphere within the town centre\\". Its classical styling, the colonnades in the form of Greek temples, and the carvings and inscriptions \\"draw comparison to battles in ancient Greece and slain warriors\\".

Early life and education  Goodell was born in San Francisco. She took admission at Sacramento State University, where she studied with Jim Nutt. However, in her third year of college, she transferred to San Francisco Art Institute, where she studied from Gregory Bateson and Jay DeFeo. She holds a B.F.A. and M.F.A from the San Francisco Art Institute.  Career  Goodell's first gallery representation was when she was 21 at the Berkeley Gallery in San Francisco . While Goodell was in San Francisco, she taught at San Francisco Art Institute, San Francisco State University, California College of the Arts, and the University of California, Davis. In 1983, she moved to New York City and later taught at Moore College of Art and Design and the School of Visual Arts, before joining State University of New York at New Paltz, where she is currently a professor in painting and drawing. In 1994, she appeared in the movie Crumb, a biographical documentary about the artist Robert Crumb, in which she played herself. She launched her work Mesmer Eyes in 2012, which featured artwork consisting of several thousand small ink paintings and optical lenses that were suspended approximately six feet away. Goodell works in sculptural objects, drawing and photography and often combines these forms into installations. According to her, she has been influenced by Lee Bontecou, Eva Hesse, Jannis Kounellis, Mario Merz, Kurt Schwitters, and Alexander Calder.  Critical reception  Peggy Cyphers of Arts Magazine said of her work, \\"(her sculptures are) ethereal in their implication of a space that is inhabited by the unseen, matter which looks to have left its skeletal structure for a new form. Baroque and constructivist devices merge in Goodell's works, their efficacious natures obsessively hand- made and exacting in their symmetry and biological patterning.\\" Reviewing Green Oculus a drawing and lens installation by Goodell, Donald Goddard wrote, \\"the lenses see the way we see - randomly, inattentively sporadically, imperfectly - focused and unfocused - voraciously. Most particularly they, and we, see the drawings, which represent what is written, the beginnings of life, as an act of the artist.\\" ArtInfo reviewed Mesmer Eyes and wrote that \\"as the lenses rotated around eye-height, they distorted the view of the painting into an ever-changing array of abstractions. These visions were also captured in photographs taken by the artist of the installation. The work played with the mutability of perception and the literal forms of the biological tools we use to see.\\" In 2014, Hyperallergic wrote about Mesmer that \\"Goodell‚Äôs works are strokes and takes on Rothko‚Äôs twin but separated chapels in Texas and at the Tate. Like Rothko‚Äôs masterworks, Goodell‚Äôs little jewels trigger degrees of color perception and color separation that no single drawing is likely to reveal.

For a long period, political kidnapping was usually a Latin American phenomenon, with some few overlooked incidents in Europe. After the 1990s, when the interest of tourists and businessmen increased in Asian and pacific countries, the kidnappings also became a means to support the political motives of newly established dissidents groups.

It is located in Hillesh√∂g, Eker√∂ Municipality just outside Stockholm, Sweden. Hillesh√∂g Church is one of the most well-preserved Romanesque churches in Stockholm County, together with Markim Church. History The location of Hillesh√∂g Church has probably been the centre of the local community since the Iron Age. Just south of the church lie three tumuli (the largest measuring in diameter) and in the rock surface, a runic inscription. The runic inscription is the longest in Uppland. Hillesh√∂g Church was built in the third quarter of the 12th century. The original church consisted of nave, choir, apse and the western tower. The model for the church was probably the church of St. Per, in Sigtuna (now ruined). The floor plan of the church is still basically unchanged, and the church retains its original entrance. During the 13th century the interior of the church underwent some changes, including the decoration of the church with frescos. The sacristy was added in the late 14th or early 15th century, and a church porch was built in the 15th century. In the same century, the original frescos were painted over with new ones. Additional changes were made in the 18th century when the windows were enlarged and the tower received its presently visible spire. The church bells were transferred from a free- standing wooden bell tower to the western tower in 1785. In the same year the frescos were covered, and when they were laid bare again during a renovation in 1921-22 they were found to be in very poor condition. Architecture The church is a hall church with a clearly distinguished choir, apse and tower. The church porch and sacristy have been added to the south and north of the church, respectively. The building material is fieldstone (with a few details made of brick), today covered with whitewash. Internally, the walls and ceiling are partially covered with frescos. The church is rich in furnishings: two triumphal crosses, from the 13th and 15th centuries; four carved wooden statues depicting Saint Martin, Saint Bridget of Sweden, an unknown bishop and a Madonna, all medieval; a processional cross from the 14th century and a decorative altar-cloth, made in L√ºbeck in the 1490s. The door to the sacristy is furthermore medieval, made of wood and reinforced with iron. Other furnishings are later, so for example the pulpit (1748) and the organ, which was bought by the church in 1773 but which probably earlier belonged to a private residence. It is encased in a Rococo case, with decorations made in papier m√¢ch√©. It is quite possibly the smallest church organ in Sweden, and was renovated in 1961 References External links * 12th- century Church of Sweden church buildings Buildings and structures in Stockholm County Uppland Churches in the Diocese of Stockholm (Church of Sweden) Churches converted from the Roman Catholic Church to the Church of Sweden ","title":"Hillesh√∂g Church"},{"id":"42473439","text":"The Accidental Prime Minister: The Making and Unmaking of Manmohan Singh is a 2014 memoir by Indian policy analyst Sanjaya Baru, who was Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's media advisor from May 2004 to August 2008.Sanjaya Baru: Director for Geo-Economics and Strategy.

The house stands south of the hamlet of North Newton, in the parish of North Petherton. It is the family seat of the Slade baronets and is a Grade II* listed building. History It is believed that Geoffrey Chaucer wrote part of The Canterbury Tales while staying at the house. Between 1648 and 1726 it was owned by the Bacon family who turned some the land, which had been part of Petherton Park, into gardens, orchards and a fish pond. It has been the family seat of the Slade baronets since 1772, when it was bought at auction for ¬£3,000. Between 1772 and 1868 wings were added to the north and west of the original building. The county surveyor Richard Carver, a pupil of Sir Jeffrey Wyattville, carried out some work in Gothic taste about 1835.Colvin, Howard, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600-1840, 3rd ed. 1995, s.v. \\"Carver, Richard\\", noting Victoria County Histories: Somerset, vol. 6:296.. The house is now used as a wedding venue and for corporate events. To enable catering for large parties a commercial kitchen was built to fit in with the architecture of the rest of the building. In 2012 the house and the current owner Sir Benjamin Slade appeared in a television programme The Guest Wing. The house also featured in an episode of ITV's Party Wright Around the World presented by Mark Wright. The house featured on BBC 1 \\"The Sheriffs are coming\\" whereby Sir Benjamin Slade was issued with a high court warrant for a immediate payment of over ¬£5,000 from an independent wedding planner for unpaid services Architecture The original building consisted of an east facing hall to which a three bay addition was made in the 15th century. The left and right hand blocks were added in the 16th and 18th centuries respectively. It is stone built with fishscale tile roofs. Estate The house stands in 2000 acre estate and is approached via a tree lined drive. The church of St Michael is within the grounds. One of the lodges by the driveway entrance, known as Dairy Mead Lodge, was built in the 18th century. The timber framed granary in the farmyard at the back of the house was built in the 19th century. The range of stables and a coach house are from the 17th and 18th century. There are four self-catering holiday cottages.

Built about 1783, it was substantially enlarged and converted into an inn in the early 20th century. The inn was the site of a meeting of notable Americans in 1945, who drafted the Dublin Declaration. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Moses Greenwood House is located in eastern Dublin, at the southeast corner of Old County and Pierce Roads. It is now a rambling 2-1/2 story frame structure, roughly H-shaped, but its shape is obscured by other additions and a single-story enclosed porch that encircles much of its exterior. Its roofs are studded with a variety of primarily gable-roofed dormers. The oldest portion of this house was built c.1783 by Moses Greenwood, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War, and is a fairly conventional four-bay wood frame structure. After being the Greenwood family home for a century, it was acquired by Mary Metcalfe, who added one wing in 1899, and Adele Thayer, who added a second wing in 1910. These additions, Georgian Revival in styling, were sympathetic to the style of the original house. It opened as the Dublin Inn in 1921. In 1945, a group of American politicians, lawyers, and businessmen met at the inn, where they drafted the Dublin Declaration, a document calling for control of nuclear weapons and the broadening of the United Nations into a worldwide governing body. Attendees included future president John F. Kennedy. A second meeting, the Dublin Assembly on Peace, was held in October 1965. This event was hosted by Anna K. Yoss, owner of the Dublin Inn. The property was later adapted for use by a drug rehabilitation clinic.

It seems to describe the singer's first hand experiences in Mexico but has a twist near the end where the singer acknowledges that he has never been to Mexico, turning the song into a \\"fantasy about escaping to an exotic land.\\" It is one of several songs on Gorilla that uses a stream of consciousness technique to describe the singer's fantasy, others including \\"Music\\" and \\"You Make It Easy.\\" Ultimate Classic Rock critic Dave Lifton sees it as a reflection of the lighter tone Taylor brought to the Gorilla album compared to his earlier brooding lyrics. \\"Mexico\\" is a happy song that contrasts Taylor's sad, sensitive image. \\"Mexico\\" has a medium tempo, a Latin music-influenced style and a \\"buoyant\\" rhythm, . Its music incorporates features of country rock music. Musicologist James Perone points out that an unusual feature of the song is an abrupt key change from A major at the end of the verses to F sharp major to begin the refrain, which Perone interprets as corresponding to the shift between describing how the singer imagines Mexico to be and his declaration that he needs to actually go there. Graham Nash and David Crosby sing backup vocals. Critic Doug Pringle describes Nash's harmony vocals as \\"lovely.\\" Reception \\"Mexico\\" peaked at only #49 on the Billboard Hot 100 but achieved substantial radio play and reached #5 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart. Its performance in Canada was similar. It only reached #83 on the singles chart but made it to #8 on the Adult Contemporary chart. Billboard described the song as an \\"easy, mid -tempo cut\\" with smooth vocals with the instrumentation dominated by percussion and steel drums. Rolling Stone critic Bud Scoppa describes the song as \\"delightful.\\" Music critic Robert Christgau rates \\"Mexico\\" and its b-side \\"Gorilla\\" as the two songs on Gorilla that he likes. Music critic Martin Smith regarded \\"Mexico\\" as his favorite song from Gorilla. Author Martin Charles Strong describes it as \\"demonstrating what Taylor was capable of when he decided to step up a gear.\\" Rolling Stone Album Guide critic Mark Coleman appreciates the song's sense of humor. In 2003, Allmusic critic Thom Jurek wrote that the song hasn't aged, and that it still seems \\"as immediate and relevant in the 21st century as [it] did in the 1970s.\\" Other appearances \\"Mexico\\" has appeared on a number of James Taylor compilation albums. It was included on the 1976 album Greatest Hits. It later appearedon the 1990 album Classic Songs, the 2003 album The Best of James Taylor and the 2013 album The Essential James Taylor. Live versions of \\"Mexico\\" have been included on several live albums, including the 1991 album Live in Rio, all versions of the 1993 album Live and the 1998 album Live at the Beacon Theatre.

This two story house and studio was built over a twenty-year period beginning in 1937 by Gouri P. Ivanov-Rinov, an artist born in Russian Turkestan. The house features distinctive construction methods not usually found in New England, since they are based on those from his homeland. The main block is a square constructed of rammed earth, with a rear extension that is wood framed, which houses the kitchen and studio. The exterior is finished in a gray stucco-like material, with wood trim. The interior of the earth walls has recessed niches for the display of artwork. The rammed-earth construction is believed to be the only building of its type in New England. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Gouri Ivanov-Rinov was the son of a Russian military officer, who followed his father into imperial Russian service, and fled to the United States after the Russian Revolution. He built the house on land given to him by another artist, Alexander James. He built the rammed earth section first, gradually adding to it features that give it flavor of a Russian dacha. He operated a summer art school here from 1945 until 1965. The house was sold of his family by 1977.

It saw action as a convoy escort during the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named for the Poundmaker Cree Nation of Saskatchewan. After the war she was sold to Peru and renamed Teniente Ferr√© in 1947. Poundmaker was ordered on 1 February 1943 as part of the 1943‚Äì1944 River-class building program. She was laid down on 29 January 1944 by Canadian Vickers Ltd. at Montreal, Quebec and launched on 21 April later that year. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 17 September 1944 at Montreal. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. War service After working up in Bermuda in November 1944, Poundmaker was assigned to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force escort group C-8 as a trans-Atlantic convoy escort. She served in this capacity until May 1945, when she returned to Canada to undergo a tropicalization refit in preparation for service in the southern Pacific Ocean. The work was completed at Lunenburg, Nova Scotia on 20 August 1945 and she was paid off on 25 November later that year at Sydney, Nova Scotia. She was taken to Shelburne and laid up for disposal. Postwar service Poundmaker underwent a minor refit at Dartmouth in 1947 at the cost of $200,000 after being sold to the Peruvian Navy. From there she sailed to Peru where she was recommissioned as the Teniente Ferr√©. In 1954 she was sent to the United States to have her armament and fire control upgraded. She was renamed as Ferr√© in 1953 and was discarded in 1966. References ;Notes ;References *Macpherson, Ken; Burgess, John.

Early life Dearen was born and raised in Sterling City, Texas, between San Angelo and Big Spring. His father, Delbert Dearen (1912-1998), and his mother, the former Thyra Violet Sparkman (1918-1974), are interred at Montvale Cemetery in Sterling City. Dearen graduated in 1969 from Sterling City High School, where one of his teachers had encouraged him in January 1966, while in his freshman year, to consider a career in writing. In 1974, he earned a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Texas at Austin. His mother, Thyra, died that same year at the age of 56. At her encouragement, young Dearen read Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan of the Apes that also played a role in his interest in becoming a writer. He won nine national and state awards as a reporter for two daily newspapers, including the San Angelo Standard-Times and the Midland Reporter-Telegram, of which his wife, Mary Gilda Dearen (born 'c. 1955), is the managing editor. Career Dearen is an authority on the Pecos and Devils Rivers, which nearly meet at Lake Amistad, and on the tenets of old-time cowboy life in West Texas. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, he conducted oral histories of 76 men who had been cowboys prior to 1932. These interviews, along with decades of archival study, enriched his 11 novels and 9 nonfiction books. One of those novels, Perseverance,Patrick Dearen, Perseverance (Eakin Press, 2006) is a story of hobos riding the railroad tracks of Texas during the Great Depression. He is also known for his interest in folklore, and writes to please professional historians and general readers.

Her short stories were first published when she was a teenager. The humor in her comedies is described as ironic and situational.

Paul was the son of David Hardy, also an artist, as was his grandfather, all from an old Yorkshire family. Early life and education Paul Hardy received his education in Clifton, West Yorkshire. He settled in Chelsea, London in 1886, and married in 1888, whereupon he moved back into the country, living at The Cottage, Church Street, Storrington. He designed and made the original galleon weathervane, now kept inside St Mary's church in Storrington. Paul was the son of David and Emily Hardy. He was married to Ida Mary Wilton Clarke Hardy (1862 - 1955) on 28 July 1888 at St. Matthias, Earl's Court, in Kensington and Chelsea, London. His son was Brigadier Gordon Paul Umfreville Hardy (1894-1974), who married Sophia H. Dickinson in 1917. Work Hardy exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1890 with His Majesty Henry VIII visits Sir Thomas More at Chelsea and again in 1899 with There it befell, that as they rode near a forest, they saw a damsel and her dwarf sore distressed. These are the only Royal Academy Exhibition works attributed to Hardy up to 1905. Hardy was a skilled metal worker and made his own replica armour. He was an advisor to both the Armoury Department at the British Museum and to the Auctioneer Sotheby's. In recognition of his work as a black and white artist, and his contribution to the study of medieval arms and armour, he was granted a Civil List pension of ¬£80 in 1932. This was followed by a Royal Academy pension of ¬£50 seven years later. Hardy illustrated at least 170 books in his career, and was equally prolific with magazines. One of the juvenile magazines he regularly drew for was Chums, which he produced illustration for from 1896 to 1940, over 40 years.

Hardy paid attention to historical detail including the rigging of ships and period costume. He maintained a collection of period costumes for his models to wear for his illustrations. Houfe notes that Hardy was one of the artist's whose work proprietor George Newnes had on display in his two-room gallery at the office of The Strand Magazine. Houfe also provides an image of the Art Gallery. Houfe states that Hardy is at his bet in costume romances and adolescent series. . . Overall, he considers Hardy A prolific but unexciting purveyor of adventure. However, Kirkpatrick quotes Brian Doyle in his Who's Who of Boys' Writers and Illustrators (1964) as saying that: Hardy‚Äôs work was at once distinctive and accomplished. The villainous characters who formed his pirate crews were faithfully portrayed and completely authentic, as were the nautical details of the old-fashioned ships he drew ... His characters invariably had staring eyes, turned-down mouths and were seldom inactive or in repose. Cooper, who rarely comments on the quality of illustrations in the titles he is cataloguing, refers to Hardy's illustrations as Stylish. The ultimate compliment is probably the way in which Chums, who had a huge stable of illustrators, kept using his work for over 40 years.

Gameplay Zarathrusta screenshot The game has a simple plot, where the Resistance is about to launch a major offensive against the Empire, but to this end, they need fuel for their spaceships. The player character is commissioned by the Resistance to retrieve fuel pods from the surface of the Empire's storage planets and transport them to the Resistance. The actual gameplay is similar to that in the original game Thrust, where the player pilots a small spaceship that is constantly subject to gravity. The player has to rotate the spaceship and thrust its engines to navigate the planet and pick up fuel pods. The Empire has various defence mechanisms on the surface of the planet. Some of them shoot at the player's spaceship or try to divert its course, whereas some merely block the spaceship's path. The player's spaceship is armed with a plasma bolt cannon and a laser scanning device, which can be used to destroy some of these defence mechanisms. Whereas the original game Thrust used vector graphics, Zarathrusta uses bitmap graphics.

The thin shell is depressed. It is deep crimson colored, with a crescent of white bordering the columella. The sculpture consists of rather narrow, spaced, acute spiral cords, of which there are two larger ones on the upper surface (one at the shoulder). The spaces between are occupied by intervening smaller spirals and very close, fine, microscopic spiral striae, decussated by finer radiating striae of increment. The upper whorls show low, radiating, scarcely visible folds. The base is nearly smooth, having only fine separated spiral threads with flat interspaces. All sculpture becomes obsolete in the white crescent except the fine, very oblique growth lines. The principal spirals of the upper surface are more or less distinctly beaded. The whorls of the spire show only two spiral carinae. The short spire is acute and contains 4¬Ω whorls. The last are rapidly enlarging, descending toward the aperture. The oval aperture is extremely oblique, reddish, and scarcely iridescent. This species may be known by the bright coral red color, or white with longitudinal stripes, usually broken into distinct squarish spots. The principal spirals above are granose.

He founded St Bartholomew's Church, Rainhill and owned Rainhill House, which became Loyola Hall. Biography He was born at Stonyhurst, Aighton, near Clitheroe, in North Lancashire, where his father is believed to have been a farmer In that area. Later he and his brothers moved to Liverpool. In 1799 Bartholomew married Jane Atkinson at the parochial chapel of St Nicholas, Liverpool. Although he was a Catholic, it was not legal to marry in a Catholic church at that time. On his marriage certificate, he gave his occupation as 'flour dealer'. Bartholomew's brother, Peter (c.1770‚Äì1844) was originally a 'coachman' but in 1800 he purchased a coaching business, and soon after Bartholomew and his brothers Francis (c 1770‚Äì1833) and Joseph (c. 1781 ‚Äì 1810) followed suit. Peter settled in Parr and his coaches ran from the Golden Lion in Dale St. Francis (c 1770 ‚Äì 1833) lived at Maghull, where he owned stables and had a small coaching business. He had coaches (one called The Rocket) running from the Crown Inn, Redcross St and from the White Horse Inn, Dale St. Later Peter moved his business to the Birmingham area and settled in Yardley, Worcestershire. Joseph ( 1781‚Äì1810) lived at Sharples, near Bolton, Lancashire, where he had a small coaching business, but he was never part of the Liverpool traffic and died aged 29. Bartholomew operated from the Saracen's Head, Dale St and his coaches included Alexander, Bang Up. Lord Exmouth, North Britain, Defiance, Regulator, Royal Mail, Telegraph and Umpire. By 1822 he ran coaches to and from Manchester fourteen times a day and four left for London every day.Dickinson, Florence: A History of Transport Through Rainhill, (Rainhill Civic Society 1979).Dickinson, Robert and Florence: The Story of Rainhill, (Rainhill Civic Society 1968). The first stage where horses were changed on journeys from Liverpool to Manchester or London was Rainhill and Bartholomew's first purchase of land there was in 1804. By 1807 he was living there and established stabling for 240 horses next to The Ship Inn. In 1824 he purchased a moiety (half) of Rainhill from James Gerard, a doctor. Soon after this he built himself a large house, Rainhill House (later it became Loyola Hall), and the beautiful St Bartholomew's Catholic Church in 1838‚Äì40. St Bartholomew's Church, Rainhill.History, St. Bartholomew's Church site Retrieved 19 January 2013. Bretherton was an important and influential resident of Rainhill, and was very much involved in the Rainhill locomotive trials in 1829, the route of which ran across part of his land. The only entrant to complete this trial successfully was the Rocket entered by George Stephenson and his son Robert. He continued as a coach proprietor until 1843. According to Prince Blucher (who married Evelyn Stapleton-Bretherton,Evelyn Princess Blucher and Major Desmond Chapman-Huston, editors. Memoirs of Prince Blucher (John Murray: London 1932), page 205. Bartholomew is said to have raced one of the first trains from Liverpool to Manchester, and beaten it by twenty minutes. Bartholomew had two daughters, Jane (1805‚Äì1806) and Mary (1809‚Äì1883). Mary married William Gerard (1806‚Äì1844) (of the same family who had once owned a moiety of Rainhill) and later Gilbert Stapleton (1808‚Äì1856) but had no children. In 1869, she changed her surname to Stapleton-Bretherton. On Bartholomew's death in 1857, Mary inherited his properties. She enlarged Rainhill House renaming it Rainhill Hall (later it was sold to the Catholic Church and renamed Loyola Hall). In 1881 she purchased the second moiety of Rainhill, becoming a very wealthy woman.

They have often been confused in historical anecdotes. Bartholomew, the son of Peter, was a coach proprietor based in Yardley, Worcestershire. Bartholomew, the son of Francis, was a jockey, and lived in Maghull, north of Liverpool.

Mary had inherited all of her father's properties and enlarged Rainhill House which later became Loyola Hall in 1923. She made the proviso in her will that to inherit, Frederick must change his surname to Stapleton-Bretherton, which he quickly did.

Retrieved 12 Apr 2014 ( or Kleinfrankreich) is the ruin of a hillside fort in the German region of Dahner Felsenland. It lies above the village of Erlenbach bei Dahn in the county of S√ºdwestpfalz in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate.  Location  The fort lies at a height of on the northern slopes of the 402-metre-high Nestelberg. Around 370 metres to the north, on the other side of a saddle-shaped side valley, is Berwartstein Castle. In the west, where it branches off the main valley formed by the water meadows of the Erlenbach, the side valley broadens into a bowl that is known locally as the Leichenfeld (\\"corpse field\\").  History  How Little France came to have such an unusual name is still unclear today; although from the castle at Berwartstein it lay in the direction of France, whose present border is only 7 kilometres away. In 1511 it was recorded as Thurm Frankreich (\\"France Tower\\"). The little castle was erected in 1484 as an outpost of the Berwartstein by the knight Hans von Trotha, later also known in the local dialect as Hans Trapp. This outwork enabled a piece of open ground known as the Leichenfeld (\\"Corpse Field\\") to be covered by a crossfire from two directions: from the north (Berwartstein) and from the south (Little France). This field was the only place where the cannons of that period could be deployed against the Berwartstein. In fact, until 1591 when the castle burned down as the result of a lightning strike and remained unoccupied for three centuries, the Berwartstein was never conquered despite numerous attempts, something which may be attributed to the existence of the auxiliary castle. After the main castle had been empty for decades, the outwork was badly damaged in the 17th century, either during the Thirty Years' War or the War of the Palatine Succession. A restoration of the remains began in 2005.  Layout  The base of a large battery tower, with a diameter of 14 metres and height about the same, has been well preserved. Its walls are 3.20 metres thick; and some of the stone ashlars show evidence of lifting marks, possibly from a three-legged lewis. The ground floor wall is pierced by three embrasures, the first floor has four. These openings could have been used by arquebuses and small firearms. The roof platform was wide enough to deploy culverins whose longer barrels increased their accuracy. North of the tower are the remains of an enceinte which used to surround it, and immediately to the northeast is a castle well, now filled in. Little France was linked to the main castle by a tunnel which, for much of its length, was a concealed ditch covered by stone slabs and concealed with earth and vegetation; it has almost entirely collapsed.

He became Ali Bey's closest and favourite fellow, his most trusted general and even his brother-in-law (according to other sources: son- in-law or adoptive son). During the Russo-Turkish War Ali Bey declared Egypt's independence from the Ottoman Empire and allegedly attempted to restore the former Mamluk Sultanate which was conquered by the Ottoman Turks 250 years before. On behalf of Ali Bey, Abu Dhahab suppressed a revolt in Upper Egypt (1769), seized the Hejaz (1770) and - allied with the Palestinian emir Zahir al-Umar - conquered large parts of Ottoman Syria (1771). Having taken Damascus (1772) from its Ottoman governor Uthman Pasha al-Kurji, Abu Dhahab changed sides, handed over all the conquered territories to the Ottomans and marched against Cairo. Ali Bey fled to Zahir al-Umar in Acre, and Abu Dhahab became the new Shaykh al-Balad (civil governor) and de facto ruler of Egypt. When Ali Bey came back and tried to restore his position, he was defeated and killed by Abu Dhahab's forces near Cairo (1773). Acting on Ottoman orders Abu Dhahab then invaded Palestine to defeat Emir Zahir, too. After conquering Gaza, Jaffa (where he massacred the whole male population) and Acre, he suddenly died of the plague. His comrades Murad Bey and Ibrahim Bey, the leaders of his Mamluk faction (Abu-Dhahab faction or Muhammadiyya), succeeded him in power.

He competed in the 1928 Summer Olympics and won the James E. Sullivan Award in 1931. Sports career Barney Berlinger was a multi- sport athlete in high school, attending William Penn Charter School and later Mercersburg Academy, where he was coached by the Scots American trainer Jimmy Curran. In addition to competing in many track and field events, he played both football and basketball and dabbled in wrestling, boxing and baseball. At the University of Pennsylvania, however, coached by Lawson Robertson, he started focusing on track and field and especially decathlon. Berlinger pulled a tendon at the 1928 Penn Relays, but recovered to place third at the Olympic Trials later that summer with 7362 points. As the top four were selected, that was enough to make the Olympic team. In the Olympic decathlon, however, he only scored 6619 points and placed 17th. Berlinger won the first of three consecutive Penn Relays decathlons in 1929 ‚Äì his achievement being recognized by the decathlon trophy being retired. He broke the meeting record on each of those occasions; in 1930 he scored 7460 points, his new personal best. Later that year he became national champion in the non-Olympic pentathlon. Berlinger became the Penn Quakers' team captain in 1931, his senior year. He won the Penn Relays decathlon for a third and final time that year, his tally of 7735 points being only 49 short of Ken Doherty's American record. He was one of nine American star athletes sent on a goodwill tour of South Africa that summer, and he broke the all-comers records there in several events. Despite only finishing fifth at the national championships, Berlinger still topped the vote for that year's James E. Sullivan Award; he was the first track and field athlete to receive the award, as golfer Bobby Jones had won the inaugural award the previous year. Berlinger missed most of the 1932 indoor season due to an injured back. That summer he concentrated on starting his business career, deciding not to try out for a place at the Olympic Games in Los Angeles; however, he resumed training the following winter. At the start of the year in March 1933, Berlinger staged his comeback after the disappointments of 1932, by beating the defending Olympic decathlon champion Jim Bausch in a head-to‚Äîhead 'septathlon' contest indoors at Madison Square Gardens in New York City. He won his only national decathlon title in 1933 with a score of 7597 despite jogging through the final event, 1500 meters, so slowly (7:03.1) that he received no points at all. Due to his versatility and key roles in his teams, Berlinger was at times called a \\"one-man track team\\". In high school, he did indeed win Mercersburg a team title by himself. He remained active in the sport even after retiring from competition for good; in 1936 he returned to the University of Pennsylvania as a deputy for the injured Robertson, and after World War II he worked as an instructor for Army coaches in Europe. In 1952, he was honored by President Dwight D. Eisenhower by being nominated as a special emissary in the president's People-to-People Sports Program. Later life Berlinger graduated from Penn in 1931 with a degree in economics. Berlinger started working for Quaker City Gear Works, a family- owned gear company, in 1932. He remained with the company for the rest of his professional life, eventually retiring as its president in 1978. He died of heart failure at his home in Carversville, Pennsylvania, in 2002 and was survived by his wife, Marguerite, as well as two children and seven grandchildren. His son, Barney Jr., was a top college football player at the University of Pennsylvania where he captained Penn's first formal Ivy League championship team in 1959. During his working life, Berlinger was issued with several patents, for example one for 'continuous shaft brake for fishing reels' in 1940.  Accolades and awards  In 1931, Berlinger was awarded the James E. Sullivan Award for being judged the outstanding amateur American sportsman that year. The same year he was awarded the title of the United States best amateur athlete by the National Sportswriters Association. In 1996, Berlinger was inducted as a member of the inaugural class in the Penn Athletics Hall of Fame. His son, Barney Berlinger Jr. was also inducted in the same class.

state of the Kingdom of Sicily), led by Italian Grand Master Giovanni Paolo Lascaris, possessed four Caribbean islands: Saint Christopher, Saint Martin, Saint Barth√©lemy, and Saint Croix. The Knights' presence in the Caribbean grew out of their order's close relationship with the French nobility and the presence of many members in the Americas as French administrators. The key figure in their brief foray into colonization was Phillippe de Longvilliers de Poincy, who was both a Knight of Malta and governor of the French colonies in the Caribbean. Poincy convinced the Knights to purchase the islands from the bankrupt Compagnie des √éles de l'Am√©rique in 1651 and stayed to govern them until his death in 1660. During this time, the Order acted as proprietor of the islands, while the King of France continued to hold nominal sovereignty; however, Poincy ruled largely independent of them both. In 1665, the Hospitallers sold their rights in the islands to the new French West India Company, bringing their colonial project to an end. Background From the beginning of the French colonization of the Americas, members of the Knights of Malta (then vassals of the Kingdom of Sicily) had been prominent in New France and the French Antilles. By this time, the Order was mostly made up of French aristocrats, and many French naval officers had trained with the Hospitaller navy. Many Knights had high-ranking positions in the early French colonial administration, including Aymar Chaste and Isaac de Razilly in Acadia, and Charles de Montmagny in Quebec. In 1635, Razilly suggested to the Grand Master of the order, Fra' Antoine de Paule, that the Hospitallers establish a priory in Acadia; however, Paulle rejected the idea. The next Grand Master, Giovanni Paolo Lascaris, was more interested in colonial affairs. In 1642 or -43 he was named godfather to an Abenaki convert in New France. Montmagny represented Lascaris at the baptism. Phillippe de Longvilliers de Poincy, founder of the Hospitaller colonies, began his career in a manner similar to these other administrators. Longvilliers fought the Turks in the Mediterranean and participated in the Sieges of the Isle of R√© and La Rochelle in 1627. In between, he served under Razilly in Acadia, commanding a fort. History Map of the order's territories in the Caribbean Poincy first went to Saint Christopher in 1639 as the appointed governor under the Compagnie des √éles de l'Am√©rique. King Louis XIII soon after made Poincy his Lieutenant-General for the entire Caribbean. Poincy began to invest heavily in building projects on the island. He extended French rule to other islands, establishing the first European settlement on Saint-Barth√©lemy in 1648, and founding a settlement on St. Croix in 1650-51. He sent an additional 300 men to reinforce and take over the small French settlement on Saint- Martin. There he negotiated the Treaty of Concordia, determining the boundary between the French and Dutch settlements that remains in place today. Poincy also established himself as the absolute ruler of the islands, resisting the authority of the failing French company. He became embroiled in conflict with the Capuchin missionaries, who disapproved of the governor's consorting with local English, Dutch, and Huguenot Protestants, and of his refusal to liberate the children of baptized slaves. Poincy also provoked resentment at his harsh treatment of subjects who resisted him. In addition he drew disfavor from the Order of Malta when he used income from the Order's commandry estates in Europe to pay for his grand style of living on the island. The company's directors decided to replace Poincy. They commissioned No√´lle Patrocles de Thoisy, a gentleman from Burgundy, to replace him, obtaining an order from the king summoning the governor back to France. Poincy refused to comply. His militia drove Thoisy off the island, and ultimately Thoisy was captured and sent back to France in chains. Grand Master Giovanni Paolo Lascaris Seeking a way to keep his position, Poincy in 1649 suggested that the Order of Malta buy the islands. By this time the Company was languishing. Poincy himself, by defying its authority, had shown its ineffectiveness. At the same time, Cardinal Mazarin, France's chief minister, was busy with the Peace of Westphalia and could not devote his attention to colonization. In 1651 the company was dissolved; its exploitation rights were sold to various parties. Martinique, Guadeloupe, and several other islands were sold to private individuals. The Hospitallers, with the approval of the Grand Master Lascaris, bought Saint-Christophe, along with Poincy's newly established dependencies of Saint Croix, Saint Barth√©lemy, and Saint Martin. The Knights' ambassador to the French court, Jacques de Souvr√©, signed the agreement. The Order's proprietary rights were confirmed in a treaty with France two years later: while the king would remain sovereign, the Knights would have complete temporal and spiritual jurisdiction on their islands. The only limits to their rule were that they could send only French knights to govern the islands, and upon the accession of each new King of France they were to provide a gold crown worth 1,000 √©cus. Charles Jacques Huault de Montmagny The council of the Grand Master decided that Poincy could continue to serve as governor, but they also made the former governor of New France, Charles de Montmagny, the \\"proconsul general,\\" sending him to represent their interests on Saint Christopher. Montmagny hoped to help Poincy get the colonies' finances in order. However, Poincy again resisted any outside interference; once Montmagny had returned to France, Poincy sent away the man left in his place. The Order sent Montmagny for a second time in 1653, as \\"lieutenant governor\\". He took formal possession of the islands in the name of the Grand Master. However, Poincy still refused to share power, and Montmagny was quickly sidelined, biding his time on a farm on Saint Christopher and hoping to take over after Poincy's death. Montmagny ultimately died first, in 1657. Poincy continued to develop the colonies. He built strong and impressive fortifications on Saint Christopher along with churches, roads, a hospital, and his own grand residence, the Ch√¢teau de la Montagne. Outside the capital, Hospitaller rule was more precarious. The settlement on Saint Barth√©lemy suffered an attack by Carib people, and those who were not killed abandoned the island. Poincy sent a group of 30 men to replace them, which grew to 100 by 1664. In 1657 a rebellion overthrew the Hospitaller regime on St. Croix. Poincy sent a new governor to restore order, build fortifications and a monastery, and begin to clear much of the island's forests for plantation agriculture. To replace Montmagny, the Order sent two new lieutenant governors. The more prominent of the two was Charles de Sales, a relative of St. Francis de Sales who proved popular with the inhabitants of the island. Shortly before his death in 1660, Poincy signed a treaty of peace with the English and the Carib people of Saint Christopher, but the peace did not last. De Sales succeeded Poincy as governor. In 1666, after the Knights had formally given up their control of the islands, fighting broke out between the French and the English on the island. In a battle at Cayonne, de Sales was killed, but the French held on to their settlements.Cf. By the early 1660s, frustration was growing that the colonies were not turning a profit. The Order still owed money to France for the initial purchase of the islands, and on Malta the knights debated whether they should sell them back. Jean-Baptiste Colbert, much more interested in colonization than Mazarin, was now in power in King Louis XIV's court, and he applied pressure to the Knights to sell. In 1665, the Knights sold their colony to the newly formed Compagnie des Indes occidentales. =Hospitaller governors on Saint Christopher= * Phillippe de Longvilliers de Poincy, 1651-1660 (Governor under the Compagnie des √éles de l'Am√©rique from 1639) * Charles de Sales, 1660-1666 * Claude de Roux de Saint-Laurent (1666‚Äì89) Legacy coat of arms of Saint Barth√©lemy. The Knights of Malta never established another colony. However, members of the order remained active in France's navy and overseas empire. Several were involved in the Mississippi Company scheme early in the eighteenth century. Later in the century, √âtienne- Fran√ßois Turgot, a Hospitaller and colonial administrator, tried unsuccessfully to settle Maltese people in Guiana. The short period of Hospitaller occupation is still remembered on the different islands. Poincy's rule on St. Kitts is remembered for the spectacle of his large, grand household, the servants all dressed in the emblem of the Knights. On St. Croix one can find frequent reference to the \\"seven flags\\" in the island's history, counting the Knights of Malta together with the United States and five European nations that have ruled it.For example, St. Barth√©lemy has in its coat of arms a Maltese cross on a red fess, representing the period of Hospitaller colonization.

He was pre-deceased by his only son and thus left his three daughters as his co-heiresses, who became wards of the crown, Mabel, Isabel and Amice. Prince John Plantagenet Following the death in 1183 of William Fitz Robert, 2nd Earl of Gloucester, the barony escheated temporarily to the crown and was controlled by King Henry II (1154-1189) until 1189. In 1187 the custodian of the barony was charged scutage on 327 knight's fees, which included lands in Wales.Sanders, p.6, note 4 In 1189 he granted one of the 2nd Earl's daughters in his wardship, Isabel FitzWilliam (d.1217), in marriage to his younger son the future King John (1199-1216), who was thereupon also granted by his father the feudal barony of Gloucester, to be held jointly with Isabel his wife, one of the co-heiresses to the barony. Geoffrey de Mandeville, 2nd Earl of Essex King John (1199-1216) was divorced from Isabel in 1199 but retained control of the barony until 1214 when it passed to Geoffrey de Mandeville, 2nd Earl of Essex (c.1191-1216), whom King John had forced Isabel to marry.

The sculptures are situated in a variety of garden and forested situations, spread over eleven hiking trails on the hillside. The trails range from easy to difficult, and the views along them change drastically with the changing of the seasons. Most of the sculptures are abstract and cryptic pieces, with each year's accessions coming from both new artists and familiar ones. The trails lead visitors by works such as Contempo Rustic, a couch fashioned from slabs of rock and metal, or Mbari House, a house-shaped granite-and-metal totem to peace and friendship. Since 1998, the institute has sponsored an annual Bridges and Connections International Sculpture Symposium. Artists are invited to visit Brookline for two weeks to create sculptures for permanent display at the institute. Sculptors from Lithuania, Latvia, England, Czech Republic, Ukraine, Egypt, Greece, Chile, and many states of the U.S. have attended the event. As the artists work, the public is invited to observe and interact with them, and to join guided tours of the collection.

Educated at Dickinson College and Princeton Theological Seminary, he served as the president of Centre College in Kentucky from 1822 to 1825. He was founding president of the Presbyterian- affiliated Oakland College in Claiborne County, Mississippi, serving from 1830 to his death in 1851. Known to favor abolition of slavery, he was a co-founder with major planters of the Mississippi Colonization Society. Affiliated with the American Colonization Society, it was formed to relocate free people of color from the state to West Africa, in the colony that developed as Liberia. In 1850 Chamberlain still owned three slaves. The following year he was murdered during an argument with a pro-slavery planter. Biography =Early life= Jeremiah Chamberlain was born on January 5, 1794 in Pennsylvania.Dickinson College: Jeremiah Chamberlain (1794‚Äì1851)Centre College: CentreCyclopedia His father, James Chamberlain, had served as a colonel in the American Revolutionary War of 1775‚Äì1783. He grew up on a farm near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. He was educated in York County and graduated from Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania in 1814. Chamberlain was a member of the first graduating class of Princeton Theological Seminary in Princeton, New Jersey in 1817. He returned to Pennsylvania, where he joined the Carlisle Presbyterian Ministry. =Career= Chamberlain served as a Presbyterian missionary in the Southwest in 1817. The following year, he began serving as a Presbyterian minister in Bedford, Pennsylvania. He served as president of Centre College in Danville, Kentucky from 1822 to 1825. The college was in grave financial straits. To improve the situation, Chamberlain negotiated for the control of the college to be relinquished by the state to the Presbyterian Church, which was effected in 1824. The Presbyterian Church was responsible for the election of the Board of Trustees and the finances of the college. Chamberlain moved South, serving next as the president of the College of Louisiana in Jackson, Louisiana from 1826 to 1828. That year, in 1828, he attempted to found a new Presbyterian academy in Mississippi. Meanwhile, he served as the minister at Bethel Presbyterian Church in Alcorn.Natchez Trace Travel Two years later, in 1830, Chamberlain was appointed as the President of Oakland College in Lorman, Mississippi. The college closed down in 1861 because of the outbreak of the American Civil War, as its students left for war. Never recovering after the war, the administrators sold the property to the state in 1870. The state legislature established Alcorn University here, the first black land grant institution in the country. The old Oakland Memorial Chapel, built in 1838, remains on its campus. Oakland College was reopened as a secondary boys' school in nearby Port Gibson in 1879 and named Chamberlain-Hunt Academy after the Oakland Founder and Mr. David Hunt, a local planter and the most generous benefactor of Oakland. C.H.A. was a college preparatory school until 2014, when it closed its doors. Map of Liberia in the 1830s, where the Mississippi and other state- sponsored colonies are identified. Chamberlain had continued to support the Union and was opposed to slavery. In the 1830s, together with planters Isaac Ross (1760‚Äì1838), Edward McGehee (1786‚Äì1880), Stephen Duncan (1787‚Äì1867), and John Ker (1789‚Äì1850), he co-founded the Mississippi Colonization Society, whose goal was to send freed slaves and other free blacks to resettle in Liberia on the African continent.Dale Edwyna Smith, The Slaves of Liberty: Freedom in Amite County, Mississippi, 1820‚Äì1868, 1999; Routledge, 2013, pp. 15‚Äì21 Mary Carol Miller, Lost Mansions of Mississippi, Jackson, Mississippi: University Press of Mississippi, 2010, Volume II, pp. 53‚Äì56 The organization was modeled after the American Colonization Society, but it focused on freedmen in Mississippi, which was a majority-slave state. The planters believed that free blacks destabilized slave society and wanted them removed. Their colony was called Mississippi-in-Africa. In 1850 Chamberlain still owned three young slaves in 1850, aged 24, 17, and 15, according to the census slave schedules.Jeremiah Chamberlain, 1850 Slave Schedule, Claiborne County, MS They likely served his family as domestic servants. =Personal life= He married Rebecca Blain (1792‚Äì1836).William L.

History The A&P; Warehouse, built for the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company grocery chain, was completed in 1897 and features a fortress-like Romanesque Revival facade. Designed by architect Frederick P. Dinkelberg as a seven-story storage building, two additional stories and an extension were eventually added.

After A&P; moved across the Hudson River to Jersey City, New Jersey, the warehouse was converted to loft apartments. By the 1970s artists had set up homes and studios within the lofts. Several famous 20th-Century artists, most notably Marisol, Andy Warhol, John Chamberlain, Wim Wenders and Robert Wilson, have called the former A&P; Warehouse home.

Among contemporary Malayalam poets, P.P. Sreedharanunni has acquired a space, which is both prominent and unpredictable. By not falling in line with any of the currently popular trends of Malayalam poetry his art exhibits bold isolation. At the same time he draws strength from the history of Malayalam versification, from the classical down to the post-modern age. His poetry manifests itself as an elusive mosaic made of myths and urban images, of plain narrative lores turning into formidable riddles, and of silken romanticism in strange company with post modern meta- narratives. When his poetic career started critics soon identified him as a later-romantic. But this rather pejorative label soon proved insufficient to explain his poetry as the poet exhibited growth in multiple directions. Today, he remains an important figure in the contemporary Malayalam poetry.

McCarthy also cited Ghigo's contribution with his \\"well-chosen locations, the crowded city scenes, detention centers and army barracks reek with the feel, sounds and discomfort of humanity pressed into unnaturally tight quarters.\\" Cinematography Critics praised the work of Guillaume Schiffman, the French cinematographer, who also worked with director Michel Hazanavicius on films such as The Artist. McCarthy described how they used \\"muted but still sharply defined colors, as well as with what appear to be mostly handheld cameras, to achieve a somber yet vitally immediate look.\\" Reception On film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, critics gave The Search a rating of 21%, based on 19 reviews, with a weighted average score of 4.71/10. On Metacritic, the film has a normalized score of 37 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". The Guardian journalist Peter Bradshaw argued that Hazanavicius' attempt at \\"Old Hollywood big-hearted sincerity\\" devolved from an earnest rejection of violence against all actors in a war, into naive sentimentality. Bradshaw did commend Hazanavicius for reminding the west and the European Union of their lack of concern and inaction when Boris Yeltsin attacked Chechenya. Chang also praised all the actors for turning \\"in fine work within fairly circumscribed parameters;\\" he described the production as \\"first-rate\\" and the sound work as excellent. However, he called the film a \\"grueling, lumbering, two-and-a-half-hour humanitarian tract that all but collapses under the weight of its own moral indignation\\" with an approach that was \\"ultimately hectoring\\" and \\"didactic.\\" The Globe and Mail critic Liam Lacey described the film as \\"long, unoriginal and heavy-handed\\", a direct opposite of Hazanavicius' Oscar-winning silent movie comedy, The Artist. Critic Todd McCarthy observed that the Chechen faction to which the Russians were responding ‚Äî referred to as rebels, terrorists or invaders elsewhere ‚Äî are conspicuously absent from the film's mosaic. McCarthy remarked that, \\"it might have behooved [the film maker] to have everyday Chechens as well as the foreigners reference them, positively or negatively, to at least make them a presence and a factor in the tragedy.\\" References External links   2014 films 2014 drama films 2014 war drama films French films French war drama films Films from Georgia (country) French-language films English-language films Russian-language films Chechen-language films French remakes of American films Films directed by Michel Hazanavicius Worldview Entertainment films Warner Bros. films ","title":"The Search (2014 film)"},{"id":"42474788","text":"The 2014 Dayton Flyers men's soccer team represented the University of Dayton during the 2014 NCAA Division I men's soccer season.

Known in Japan as , it is a commercially important fish especially for Akita and Yamagata prefectures. Its habitat occurs in sandy-mud bottoms ranging from the Sea of Japan to the Okhotsk Sea. As a food source, the fish has mostly been sourced locally from the coastal region of the Sea of Japan, and has been designated the official prefectural fish of Akita Prefecture. The fish, which is scaleless, may be prepared whole as braised or grilled fish, and has a mucilaginous consistency. It is also dried to make stockfish; salted, dried, and made into himono; and cured in miso as misozuke. It is the main ingredient of the fish sauce called shottsuru. The egg masses are known as burikko. In Korean the fish is called dorumuk. The fish had also been used dried or in fish meal form as fertilizer, and shipped to agricultural areas at one time, into the 20th century.  Life cycle and behavior Arctoscopus japonicus has a life span of 5 years, attaining a typical fork length of . It is a deep sea fish that usually inhabits sandy and muddy sea floors in waters (Fedorov, V.V., I.A. Chereshnev, M.V. Nazarkin, A.V. Shestakov and V.V. Volobuev, 2003.

The males reach sexual maturity at 1 1/2 years of age and beyond, and females at the 2-year-old stage; the individuals do not die after single spawning, and have several breeding cycles during their life span. abstract It preys and feeds on amphipods, copepods, mysidacea, krill, squid, and fish. abstract = Distribution = It is distributed in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, particularly the Sea of Japan to the Okhotsk Sea, Kurile Islands and Kamchatka Peninsula.; cited in Three broad regional population groups had been postulated by Okiyama (1970) based on tagging,, cited by and later mitochondrial DNA analysis confirmed these grouping on a genetic basis.Finding in , summarized in (latter is in Japanese) The population groups are: * Western Japan (WJ) ‚Äì This is a group that migrate the coast of the Sea of Japan from Tottori to Akita Prefecture. It comprises the \\"northern Sea of Japan\\" and \\"western Sea of Japan\\" subgroups. pdf (alternate site) The spawning grounds of the group has been assumed to be off all along the coast, but bulk spawning grounds are absent around the Noto Peninsula and any further west/south, and in fact, it has been reported that the western Sea of Japan group's spawning grounds occur in the east coast of the Korean peninsula.Choi et al., 1983, cited in * South Hokkaido (SH) ‚Äì This is a group with breeding grounds in the Pacific Ocean off Hokkaido. It consists of , , Hidaka, Kushiro, and Nemuro subgroups. * Eastern Korea (EK) ‚Äì This group has breeding grounds in the eastern coast of the Korean Peninsula. Catch production in the T≈çhoku region (Northeastern Japan)'s Pacific coast (otherwise known as \\"Sanriku\\") is modest, and no regular spawning grounds have been confirmed. Migration routes have not been charted, but their travel range is considered extensive, since individuals from the Hokkaido and Sea of Japan population groups have been captured in the Sanriku shore. = External morphology = The color is silvery underneath, and light brown above with dark brown streaks flecked with spots. Tall body depth, though not as tall as the Pacific sandfish (Trichodon trichodon). Head and trunk are scaleless. A large mouth, oblique and turned upwards, is lined with rows of fine teeth. The gill-flap on the cheek (preopercle) each has five sharp spines. It has a first dorsal and a second dorsal fin that are separated by a gap. The pectoral fins are particularly large. The fish lacks an air-bladder. It is active nocturnally, and during the day time lies buried in the mud or sand on the sea bottom, with only the mouth and eyes (and the spine) visible. The egg mass (roe) is usually green, but may also have yellow, red, or brown coloration. Pigment components present in the eggs include bilin and carotenoids such as idoxanthin, crustaxanthin, and vitamin A2 aldehyde (3-dehydroretinal). The bilin and retinal produces the base green color, and the amount of relative idoxanthin content is the key determinant of the color variation. Study of its prey (such as the amphipods) or the fish's stomach contents reveal negligible traces of idoxanthin and crustaxanthin, which means the fish must be internally converting other carotenoid substances such as astaxanthin that are abundant in their food into idoxanthin and crustaxanthin, given that fish in general cannot build their own carotenoid wholly out of building block materials. Researchers hypothesize that the intake of astaxanthin influences the idoxanthin concentration in the body, which result in the egg color change.  Classification  Wet specimens of Hatahata and Ezo hatahata at Oga Aquarium Gao In the current taxonomy, the species is classified under the Perciformes (perch-likes) order, Trachinoidei suborder, and Trichodontidae (sandfishes) family. However, mitochondrial DNA analysis indicates that the species is more closely related to Cottus spp. of the Scorpaeniformes order. Press release NDL data = Similar species = * Pacific sandfish, Trichodon trichodon, or ezo hatahata in Japanese, found from the Aleutian Islands to Alaska down to California.  Nomenclature  The Japanese name hatahata may be written as È∞∞, which consists of the fish radical È≠ö combined with the character . Shokusanjin (≈åta Nanpo) records the lore that it came to be written this way \\"because within its scales arises the pattern of Mount Fuji, and was celebrated as auspicious fish,\\" though the actual species has no scales.ËúÄÂ±±‰∫∫„Äé‰∏ÄË©±‰∏ÄË®Ä„ÄèÂ∑ªÂçÅ‰∏Ä„ÄåÈ±ó„ÅÆ‰∏≠„Å´ÂØåÂ£´Â±±„ÅÆ„ÇÇ„ÇÑ„ÅÜ„ÇíÁîü„ÅòÂÄôÊïÖ„ÄÅ„ÇÅ„Åß„Åü„ÅçÈ≠ö„Å®Á•ù„Åó„ÄÅÊñáÂ≠ó„ÅØ„ÅÑ„Å§„Åî„Çç„Çà„Çä„ÅãÈ≠öÁØá„Å´Á•û„Å®Êõ∏„Å™„Çä„ÄÅ„Äç An alternate Japanese name is , which derives from their spawning (and catching) season coinciding with the months when thunderstorms become frequent. In fact, hatahata is an old onomatopoeia representing the sound of the thunderclap, whose use is attested in the 10th century Kager≈ç Nikki, and which is the root of the verb hatata-ku \\"to thunder.\\" In the , hatahata sounds like hadahada to non-natives, because the \\"ta\\" is locally pronounced in voiced unaspirated , so that hadahada is sometimes listed as a local name for the fish. In Akita, the fish sometimes bears the name \\"satake uo\\" after the Satake clan who were rules of the land around 1600. But the Satakes were originally rooted in Hitachi Province (present-day Ibaraki Prefecture), and legend has it that the fish followed the masters from the old country (Shokusanjin notes that the legend is given in the ). In Tottori Prefecture the fish is called shirohata or kitaha.Called shima aji in the vicinity of N≈ç, Niigata, though this is misleading that term refers to the white trevally in mainstream Japan. (ÊºÅÊùë„Å®Â≥∂ (2004), p.81)  Fishing practices  The species is caught by bottom trawling offshore and by and gillnetting the coastal spawning waters. The fish stock down further south are caught by Danish seine fishing. In Akita Prefecture, each household used to buy them in bulk by the crates (5 or 10 crates at a time) when in season, and the surplus would be preserved as salted fish or as nukazuke to be consumed as a protein source over the winter. (Akita City's published municipal history, governmental publication) FAO Statistics record that in 1950, the annual catch was accounted solely in Japan, by the beginning of the 1970s Korean fisheries were catching half as much or more in tonnage as the Japanese. The global peak catch occurred in 1971 with total, but by the end of the decade in 1979 there was a sharp collapse in the fish stock resulting in an annual catch of only . In Akita Prefecture, peak catch volume reached per year, but overfishing, possibly with an interplay of water temperature \\"regime\\" shifts, led to persisting depletion of stock, so that the fishermen of Akita Prefecture, led by its self-imposed a total moratorium on the catch from 1992-1995The fishery closure years are graphed in fig. 4, In 1999, four participating prefectures formed a fisheries management organization to manage the fish stock, followed in 2003 by a formal Resource Recovery Plan (Ë≥áÊ∫êÂõûÂæ©Ë®àÁîª) for these prefectures. In Korea, the catch was per year in 1971, but suffered a similar decline to by 2008, and that country has also instituted conservation measures. Tottori prefecture is another area with significant participation in catching this species. Whereas Akita targets egg- carrying adults approach the surface to spawn, Tottori fishing practices capture the deep water migrating populations by bottom trawling, so that the caught fish tends to be fattier, though they do not carry eggs. The catch season for Tottori spans from September to May. = Fishing restrictions = * In 1999 the Aomori, Akita, Yamagata, and Niigata prefectures instituted restrictions prohibiting capture of fish measuring less than . * Accidents and drownings involving sports fishermen going overboard as well as poaching egg masses (scavenging eggs washed ashore also constitute poaching) has prompted regulations and patrolling efforts by the and police. ** Foraging, possessing and engaging in sales of egg masses are prohibited (Aomori and Akita) ** Fishing method restrictions (Aomori, Akita, Yamagata)  Uses  At one time, dried hatahata was one type of fish-based fertilizer (fish manure) being trafficked in Japan.Statistics for quantities entering the Tokyo Market indicate over 15,000 hy≈ç were shipped in 1903, but none during the other years from 1902 ~ 1911.

If the fish is fresh, snapping the bone at the base of the tail beforehand, will make it easier for the spine to come off easily after broiling. Fresh hatahata can be served salted and broiled, or be poached in a pot flavored with soy sauce, sake kasu, and especially shottsuru. In Akita, the pot dish would be flavored with shottsuru, a fish sauce traditionally made by curing the fish in brine. Another preparation is the (slathered with sweet miso paste and broiled), which is eaten not only in Akita but also in the around Sakata, Yamagata. The fish is preserved in various ways, such as nukazuke (pickled in rice bran and salt), himono (as dried fish), (FAQ published by Tottori Prefecture Library. Questioner sought market size of hatahata himono.

It can be made into hatahata-jiru (miso soup), but the miso should be dissolved in the broth before the fish is plunged, otherwise the fish falls apart. In South Korea, the fish (known there as dorumuk ()) is eaten in communities in Gangwon Province and elsewhere along the Sea of Japan (which Koreans call \\"Donghae\\" or \\"East Sea\\"). In Korea it is mainly an ingredient for jjigae hot pot dishes, but sometimes the roe-laden females are grilled and eaten. = Shottsuru = shottsuru Locally, a fish sauce called shottsuru is made from this fish. The sauce which literally means \\"salty juice\\", is made by pickling and fermenting the salted fish, and straining out the debris. The fish sauce is used to flavor the shottsuru nabe, or pot dish that uses this flavoring to cook the hatahata with vegetable and other ingredients. In the Akita dialect, the pot dish also sometimes called shottsuru kayaki, with \\"\\" being the local term for nabe or hot pot dish. = Roe = In the , the roe of this species is called buriko. The fish is caught during its spawning season, when many of the females are loaded with eggs in diameter. The eggs are surrounded by slimy mucous. Fresh roe that is cooked will burst and make light popping sounds when eaten, but roe from the fish preserved in salt or miso turn rubbery and hard to chew, resulting in a more blunt sound that sounds like buri buri which resulted in its name.

It is a fictionalized account of the experiences of the largely African American 369th Infantry Regiment, nicknamed the \\"Hell-fighters\\" by German soldiers, during the First World War. Plot The novel is narrated by Mark, a veteran of the 369th's tour in Europe. It begins upon the inception of U.S. involvement in World War I, with recruitment for the 15th New York National Guard Regiment being held in Harlem, New York. The soldiers, though all black, come from a diverse array of backgrounds, classes, and cultures, leading to some initial internal strain. The 15th is headed by Lieutenant Adams and Sergeant Mandla. In July 1917, the regiment commences basic training at Camp Whitman, where they are strictly disciplined and educated by a benevolent Adams. Concurrently, members of the regimental band are subjected to the precise training of renowned bandleader Lt. James Europe. It's here that the African-American soldiers begin to first feel the effects of segregation with the United States Army; they are given uniforms later than their white counterparts and train with broomsticks in the place of rifles. In October, the regiment is reassigned to Spartanburg, South Carolina to finish their training. Fears run high within their ranks given that the town is located in the Jim Crow South; only weeks earlier tensions between racist locals and African-American trainees had led to a riot in Houston. In order to preserve the well-being of his men, Lt. Adams orders them to completely ignore any verbal or physical provocations made by the local populace. Mark and several of his fellow infantrymen are subject to a vicious beating at the hands of townsmen that is only broken up when white soldiers from the 7th Infantry Regiment intervene. After a handful of weeks in Spartanburg, the 15th is deployed to France. When they reach the Western Front in January 1918, the regiment is bitterly assigned to laborious roles, unloading ships and performing janitorial tasks for the American Expeditionary Force. After months more of \\"pick and shovel work,\\" the 15th is reorganized into the 369th Infantry Regiment and transferred under the jurisdiction of the French Fourth Army. The French soldiers show a foreign level of acceptance and tolerance of theblack presence. Mark's friend David Scott is killed by a sniper on their first day in the trenches whilst naively peeking into no man's land. The 369th is soon taken aback by the brutal realities of war; the rat- infested, muddy, lice-encompassed trenches become a subject of much complaining. Nonetheless, the soldiers soon prove themselves in combat. Private Henry Johnson becomes the first American to receive the Croix de Guerre after dispatching a German \\"raider party\\" armed solely with a bolo knife and rifle, saving the lives of multiple comrades. This results in the 369th's rise to prominence on both sides of the war, with the Germans nicknaming them the Harlem Hellfighters. As the war progresses, bombings and gas attacks become part of the 369th's daily routine. The African American soldiers soon face intense discrimination from their white counterparts; they are eventually barred altogether from social interactions with the friendlier French. Mark is soon arrested by military police after defending himself against a provocation by white soldiers. A frustrated Mark, insisting that he is fighting a \\"white man's war\\", transfers to a labor unit. Anticipating the Second Battle of the Marne, the Expeditionary Force formulates a plan to retreat from the would-be German assaulted forward trenches whilst bombarding German supply roads. However, in order for this to be executed, the Americans must enforce the illusion that the trenches are still stocked with men by placing a \\"volunteer unit\\" left behind. Lt. Adams subsequently volunteers the 369th for this duty. Shortly before combat commences, Mark returns to his regiment, who rides out German bombardment of the forward trenches completely unscathed. Immediately afterwards the 369th participates in the perilous Allied counterattack, with Sgt. Mandla being killed in the process. The novel ends with a series of conclusory panels, dictating that the Harlem Hellfighters spent 191 days in combat, were the first Allied unit to reach the Rhine, and that they received a victory parade upon their return home to New York. Production Brooks' interest in the 369th Infantry Division was sparked as a 10-year-old, when a tutor told him their story. As an adult, Brooks attempted to have their story turned into a film, pitching his script across the movie industry to no avail. The various studios Brooks sought out believed that World War I had been rendered obscure to the general American public; they believed a film dealing with the subject would not be profitable. Finally, after collaborating with White on a graphic companion to his novel The Zombie Survival Guide in 2006, Brooks realized the story could be told within the comics medium sans the financial concerns of film. =Fact vs. fiction= Brooks often employed the use of amalgamation in creating the characters of The Harlem Hellfighters, taking inspiration from real life soldiers and transmitting it onto the pages in the form of a single individual. For example, Lt. Adams was a combination of several black officers at the time. The role of a French officer derived inspiration from an excerpt of From Harlem to the Rhine. Concurrently, real-life members of the 369th were utilized in the novel's fictionalized retelling, among them James Europe, Henry Johnson, Arthur Little, and Henri Gouraud. Another difference between the book and reality, is that while the Hellfighters did receive a parade in Paris and were adored and considered heroes by the French, they were not given many accolades when they returned home to the United States, aside from a parade in New York City on February 17, 1919. In fact, a number of the 369th soldiers elected to stay in France after the war was over, rather than come back to a segregated America, where they would be expected to resume their place at the bottom of the social ladder. Reception =Critical= Reaction to the graphic novel was positive. Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr hailed The Harlem Hellfighters as \\"a major contribution to our understanding of Black History.\\" The Washington Post went on to praise the illustrations, arguing that \\"White‚Äôs grid work is forever shifting, as his overlapping panels shuffle like snapshots fallen from a scrapbook, and his full ‚Äúsplash‚Äù pages are so visually engaging that the greedy reader wishes he‚Äôd provided yet more of them.\\" Film adaptation Sony Pictures has purchased the rights to create a film version of the novel, with Caleeb Pinkett and James Lassiter producing on behalf of Overbrook Entertainment under the leadership of Will Smith.

This is done with a variety of equipment including special built stereo cameras, single cameras with or without special attachments, and paired cameras. This involves traditional film cameras as well as, tape and modern digital cameras. A number of specialized techniques are employed to produce different kinds of stereo images. Types of photography =Film photography= The Stereo Realist, which defined a new stereo format. The middle lens is for view-finding. Sputnik stereo camera (Soviet Union, 1960s). Although there are three lenses present, only the lower two are used for the photograph ‚Äì the third lens serves as a viewfinder for composition. The Sputnik produces two side-by-side square images on 120 film. It is necessary to take two photographs from different horizontal positions to get a true stereoscopic image pair. This can be done with two separate side-by-side cameras; with one camera moved from one position to another between exposures; with one camera and a single exposure by means of an attached mirror or prism arrangement that presents a stereoscopic image pair to the camera lens; or with a stereo camera incorporating two or more side-by-side lenses. Charles Wheatstone first began experimenting with stereopsis in 1838 using specially constructed drawings. The invention of photography in 1839 opened up a new and more detailed medium for his experiments and the first photographic stereoscopic pairs appeared in the early 1840s as Daguerreotypes and Calotypes. By the 1850s, a stereoscope and an assortment of professionally photographed stereo views were becoming part of the standard equipment of a properly furnished middle-class parlor. In the 1890s, photographic plates and films sensitive enough to make casual \\"snapshot\\" photography practical were available, and combined with easy-to-use cameras they were making amateur photography a very popular hobby. Stereo cameras were in the mix. The earliest were inconveniently large and the end result was a pair of paper prints mounted on a card for viewing in a standard stereoscope. They were soon joined by smaller cameras that yielded relatively small stereo slides on glass. The popularity of stereo photography declined after the First World War and plummeted during the Great Depression of the 1930s. In the late 1940s, compact imported European stereo cameras that used 35 mm slide film began appearing in the US market. The most notable example was the Verascope F40. These cameras featured a \\"7P\\" format, meaning that each image was 7 film perforations (sprocket holes) wide, yielding 11 stereo pairs on a 20-exposure roll of 35 mm film.MAKE YOUR OWN STEREO PICTURES by Julius B Kaiser pp. 41-43 Because these cameras (and some later models) came from Europe, this became known as the \\"European format\\". In 1945, ads began appearing for an American camera known as the Stereo Realist. The camera was not actually available for purchase until 1947, but the ads generated a lot of excitement among stereo photography enthusiasts.Amazing 3D by Hal Morgan and Dan Symmes pp. 32-33 The Stereo Realist featured a more compact 5P format, which soon became known as the \\"Realist format\\". It yielded 16 pairs on a 20-exposure roll and was therefore more economical than the 7P format.MAKE YOUR OWN STEREO PICTURES by Julius B Kaiser p. 42 By 1952 several competitors were already marketing their own cameras using the 5P format, making it the de facto US industry standard.Amazing 3D by Hal Morgan and Dan Symmes p. 42 Several 5P format cameras were also made in Europe.http://www.stereoscopy.com/cameras More compact and convenient than their pre-World War II predecessors, these cameras adopted the increasingly popular 135 film (35 mm) format that allowed the use of Kodachrome color film, which produced color transparencies (\\"slides\\") instead of prints on paper. The relative novelty of Kodachrome's vivid colors and the realism of 3-D were each attractive individually, but the astonishingly lifelike effect of the two combined proved irresistible to many consumers. The new cameras were marketed with corresponding two-lensed Realist-format slide viewers, which typically had a built-in light source and adjustable optics. With only these two items the owner could capture, relive and share multicolored and stereoscopically preserved memories. For group viewing, a polarized stereoscopic slide projector, silver screen and polarized glasses could be added to the system. Other accessories were available, including equipment and supplies for those who preferred to mount their own slides. Both Realist Inc. and Kodak offered stereo mounting services for those who would rather not. The popularity of amateur stereoscopic photography helped trigger a brief pop culture fad of 3D movies, 3D comic books, etc.,Amazing 3D by Hal Morgan and Dan Symmes pp. 44-45 which in turn helped to introduce new enthusiasts to the ranks of amateur stereo photographers. Unlike the pop culture 3D fad, which came and went quickly and was primarily a 1953 phenomenon, the popularity of amateur stereo photography started earlier, grew more slowly, peaked later, and declined more gradually. Eight new stereo cameras hit the market in 1954, including the Kodak Stereo Camera which may have driven several competitors out of the business.Amazing 3D by Hal Morgan and Dan Symmes p. 49 Kodak's stereo camera was not discontinued until 1959, Kodaslide stereo viewers were available until 1962, and the Realist continued in production, although ultimately in very small quantities, into 1971. Subsequent decades found new users replenishing the ranks of loyal devotees and supporting a solid market for second-hand equipment. Kodak's stereo mounting service was continued, through Qualex, into the early 1990s. Even today, despite the general transition from film to digital and from slide viewing and projection to slide scanning and video display, some of this sturdy equipment is still in use by a small core of enthusiasts of all ages. The 1980s saw a minor revival of stereoscopic photography when several point-and-shoot stereo cameras were introduced. Most of these cameras suffered from poor optics and plastic construction and were designed to produce lenticular prints, a format which never gained wide acceptance, so they never gained the popularity of the 1950s stereo cameras. In the 1990s cameras came out that were intended to make stereo pairs, specifically designed to use print film, producing a half frame format that could be viewed using freevision or the included print viewer, directly as it came from a standard processing lab. The original Loreo was the pioneer,Stereo World magazine Volume 17, no.4 September/October 1990 pp. 28-30 but it was followed by several other cameras, including some designed to take macro shots. =Digital photography= Fujifilm FinePix Real 3D W3 The beginning of the 21st century marked the coming of the age of digital photography. Stereo lenses were introduced which could turn an ordinary film camera into a stereo camera by using a special double lens to take two images and direct them through a single lens to capture them side by side on the film. These are also available for digital SLR cameras. It is also possible to create a twin camera rig, together with a \\"shepherd\\" device to synchronize the shutter and flash of the two cameras. By mounting two cameras on a bracket, spaced a bit, with a mechanism to make both take pictures at the same time. In 2009 digital stereo cameras such as the Fuji W1 began appearing in the consumer market. Several companies joined the digital stereo market producing digital stereo cameras that sold for as little as $100. 3D capability was even added to some smart phones. Newer cameras, such as the Fuji W3, can also be used to shoot full motion 480P video at up 30 frames per second or 720P video at 24 frames per second, thus making amateur 3D video possible. Some cameras can also take images that greatly exceed HDTV resolution at up to ten pictures per second. If anything is in motion within the field of view, it is necessary to take both images at once, either through use of a specialized two-lens camera or by using two identical cameras operated as close as possible to the same moment. A single camera can also be used if the subject remains perfectly still (such as an object in a museum display). Two exposures are required. The camera can be moved on a sliding bar for offset, or with practice, the photographer can simply shift the camera while holding it straight and level. This method of taking stereo photos is sometimes referred to as the \\"Cha-Cha\\" or \\"Rock and Roll\\" method. It is also sometimes referred to as the \\"astronaut shuffle\\" because it was used to take stereo pictures on the surface of the moon using normal monoscopic equipment.Stereo World, National Stereoscopic Association Vol 17 #3 pp. 4‚Äì10 =Digital stereo bases (baselines)= There are different cameras with different stereo bases (distances between the two camera lenses) in the nonprofessional market of 3D digital cameras used for stills and video: *? mm Inlife-Handnet HDC-810 *10 mm Panasonic 3D Lumix H-FT012 lens (for the GH2, GF2, GF3, GF5, GF6 cams and also for the hybrid W8 cam). *12 mm DXG-5D8 cam and the clones Medion 3D and Praktica DMMC-3D. *15 mm Ararat Macro Beam Splitter for smartphones. *20 mm Sony Bloggie 3D (MHS-FS3). *23 mm Loreo 3D Macro lens. *25 mm LG Optimus 3D, LG Optimus 3D MAX (smartphones) and the Cyclopital3D close-up macro adapter (for the W1 and W3 Fujifilm cams). *28 mm Sharp Aquos SH80F and SHI12 (smartphones) and the Toshiba Camileo z100 camcorder. *30 mm Panasonic 3D1 camera. *32 mm HTC EVO 3D smartphone. *35 mm JVC TD1, DXG-5G2V, VTech Kidizoom 3D, GoPro HD Hero kit 3D, Nintendo 3D, Vivitar 790 HD (only for anaglyph stills and video), and AEE 3D Magicam. *40 mm Aiptek I2 (also the Viewsonic clone), Aiptek I2P Aiptek IS2 and Aiptek IH3 3D cams. *50 mm Loreo for full frame or non digital cams, and the 3D FUN cam of 3dInlife (also the clones Phenix PHC1, Phenix SDC821 and Rollei Powerflex 3D). *55 mm SVP dc-3D-80 cam (parallel & anaglyph, stills & video). *60 mm Vivitar 3D cam (only for anaglyph pictures). *65 mm Takara Tomy 3D ShotCam. *75 mm Fujifilm W3 cam. *77 mm Fujifilm W1 cam. *88 mm Loreo 3D lens for digital cams. *140mm Cyclopital3D base extender for the JVC TD1 and Sony TD10. *200mm Cyclopital3D base extender for the Panasonic AG-3DA1. *225mm Cyclopital3D base extender for the Fujifilm W1 and W3 cams. Base line selection For general purpose stereo photography, where the goal is to duplicate natural human vision and give a visual impression as close as possible to actually being there, the correct baseline (distance between where the right and left images are taken) would be the same as the distance between the eyes. When images taken with such a baseline are viewed using a viewing method that duplicates the conditions under which the picture is taken then the result would be an image pretty much the same as what would be seen at the site the photo was taken. This could be described as \\"ortho stereo.\\" An example would be the Realist format that was so popular in the late 1940s to mid-1950s and is still being used by some today. When these images are viewed using high quality viewers, or seen with a properly set up projector, the impression is, indeed, very close to being at the site of photography. Of course, it is seldom possible to duplicate the exact conditions under which the photo is taken, just as it is rarely possible to exactly match the original colors, but ortho stereo tries to duplicate the natural stereo impression as close as possible just as color photography tries to give a natural impression of color, even if it isn't an exact match. The baseline used in such cases will be about 50mm to 80mm. This is what is generally referred to as a \\"normal\\" baseline, used in most stereo photography. There are, however, situations where it might be desirable to use a longer or shorter baseline. The factors to consider include the viewing method to be used and the goal in taking the picture. Note that the concept of baseline also applies to other branches of stereography, such as stereo drawings and computer generated stereo images, but it involves the point of view chosen rather than actual physical separation of cameras or lenses. = Longer base line for distant objects ‚Äì \\"Hyper Stereo\\" = If a stereo picture is taken of a large, distant object such as a mountain or a large building using a normal base it will appear to be flat. This is in keeping with normal human vision - it would look flat if one were actually there; but if the object looks flat, there doesn't seem to be any point in taking a stereo picture, as it will simply seem to be behind a stereo window, with no depth in the scene itself, much like looking at a flat photograph from a distance. One way of dealing with this situation is to include a foreground object to add depth interest and enhance the feeling of \\"being there\\", and this is the advice commonly given to novice stereographers.Stereo Realist Manual, p. 27.Stereo Realist Manual, p. 261. Caution must be used, however, to ensure that the foreground object is not too prominent, and appears to be a natural part of the scene, otherwise it will seem to become the subject with the distant object being merely the background.Stereo Realist Manual, p. 156. In cases like this, if the picture is just one of a series with other pictures showing more dramatic depth, it might make sense just to leave it flat, but behind a window. For making stereo images featuring only a distant object (e.g., a mountain with foothills), the camera positions can be separated by a larger distance (called the \\"interaxial\\" or stereo base, often mistakenly called \\"interocular\\") than the adult human norm of 62‚Äì65mm. This will effectively render the captured image as though it was seen by a giant, and thus will enhance the depth perception of these distant objects, and reduce the apparent scale of the scene proportionately. However, in this case, care must be taken not to bring objects in the close foreground too close to the viewer, as they will show excessive parallax and can complicate stereo window adjustment. There are two main ways to accomplish this. One is to use two cameras separated by the required distance, the other is to shift a single camera the required distance between shots. The shift method has been used with cameras such as the Stereo Realist to take hypers, either by taking two pairs and selecting the best frames, or by alternately capping each lens and recocking the shutter. It is also possible to take hyperstereo pictures using an ordinary single lens camera aiming out an airplane. One must be careful, however, about movement of clouds between shots.Stereoworld Vol 21 #1 March/April 1994 IFC, 51 It has even been suggested that a version of hyperstereo could be used to help pilots fly planes.Stereoworld Vol 16 #1 March/April 1989 pp 36‚Äì37 In such situations, where an ortho stereo viewing method is used, a common rule of thumb is the 1:30 rule. This means that the baseline will be equal to 1/30 of the distance to the nearest object included in the photograph. The results of hyperstereo can be quite impressive,Stereoworld Vol 16 #2 May/June 1989 pp. 20‚Äì21Stereoworld Vol 8 #1 March/April 1981 pp. 16‚Äì17Stereoworld Vol 31 #6 May/June 2006 pp. 16‚Äì22 and examples of hyperstereo can be found in vintage views.Stereoworld Vol 17 #5 Nov/DEC 1990 pp. 32‚Äì33 This technique can be applied to 3D imaging of the Moon: one picture is taken at moonrise, the other at moonset, as the face of the Moon is centered towards the center of the Earth and the diurnal rotation carries the photographer around the perimeter, though the results are rather poor,Stereo Lunar Photos by John C. Ballou An in depth look at moon stereos with examples using several techniques and much better results can be obtained using alternative techniques. This is why high quality published stereos of the moon are done using libration,Stereoworld Vol 23 #2 May/June 1996 pp. 25‚Äì30London Stereoscopic Company ‚Äì Official Web Site a more indepth explanation the slight \\"wobbling\\" of the moon on its axis relative to the earth.Stereoworld Vol 15 #3 July/August 1988 pp. 25‚Äì30 Similar techniques were used late in the 19th century to take stereo views of Mars and other astronomical subjects.  Limitations of hyperstereo  Illustration of parallax multiplication limits with A at 30 and 2000 feet Vertical alignment can become a big problem, especially if the terrain on which the two camera positions are placed is uneven. Movement of objects in the scene can make syncing two widely separated cameras a nightmare. When a single camera is moved between two positions even subtle movements such as plants blowing in the wind and the movement of clouds can become a problem.Stereo World Volume 37 #1 Inside Front Cover The wider the baseline, the more of a problem this becomes. Pictures taken in this fashion take on the appearance of a miniature model, taken from a short distance,The Vision of Hyperspace, Arthur Chandler, 1975, Stereo World, vol 2 #5 pp. 2‚Äì3, 12 and those not familiar with such pictures often cannot be convinced that it is the real object. This is because we cannot see depth when looking at such scenes in real life and our brains aren't equipped to deal with the artificial depth created by such techniques, and so our minds tell us it must be a smaller object viewed from a short distance, which would have depth. Though most do eventually realize that it is, indeed, an image of a large object from far away, many find the effect bothersome.Hyperspace a comment, Paul Wing, 1976, Stereo World, vol 2 #6 page 2 This doesn't rule out using such techniques, but it is one of the factors that need to be considered when deciding whether or not such a technique should be used. In movies and other forms of \\"3D\\" entertainment, hyperstereo may be used to simulate the viewpoint of a giant, with eyes a hundred feet apart. The miniaturization would be just what the photographer (or designer in the case of drawings/computer generated images) had in mind. On the other hand, in the case of a massive ship flying through space the impression that it is a miniature model is probably not what the film makers intended! Hyper stereo can also lead to cardboarding, an effect that creates stereos in which different objects seem well separated in depth, but the objects themselves seem flat. This is because parallax is quantized. Illustration of the limits of parallax multiplication, refer to image at right. Ortho viewing method assumed. The line represents the Z axis, so imagine that it is laying flat and stretching into the distance. If the camera is at X point A is on an object at 30 feet. Point B is on an object at 200 feet and point C is on the same object but 1 inch behind B. Point D is on an object 250 feet away. With a normal baseline point A is clearly in the foreground, with B,C, and D all at stereo infinity. With a one-foot base line, which multiplies the parallax, there will be enough parallax to separate all four points, though the depth in the object containing B and C will still be subtle. If this object is the main subject, we may consider a baseline of 6 feet 8 inches but then the object at A would need to be cropped out. Now imagine that the camera is point Y, now the object at A is at 2,000 feet, point B is on an object at 2,170 feet C is a point on the same object 1 inch behind B. Point D is on an object at 2,220 feet. With a normal baseline, all four points are now at stereo infinity. With a 67-foot baseline, the multiplied parallax allows us to see that all three objects are on different planes, yet points B and C, on the same object, appear to be on the same plane and all three objects appear flat. This is because there are discrete units of parallax, so at 2,170 feet the parallax between B and C is zero and zero multiplied by any number is still zero. Small anaglyphed image  A practical example  In the red-cyan anaglyph example to the right, a ten-meter baseline atop the roof ridge of a house was used to image the mountain. The two foothill ridges are about distant and are separated in depth from each other and the background. The baseline is still too short to resolve the depth of the two more distant major peaks from each other. Owing to various trees that appeared in only one of the images the final image had to be severely cropped at each side and the bottom. In the wider image below, taken from a different location, a single camera was walked about between pictures. The images were converted to monochrome before combination. Long base line image showing prominent foothill ridges; click the image for more information on the technique = The PEPAX principle ‚Äì \\"telephoto stereo\\" = Pepax, thought to be an amalgamation of PErspective and PArallaX,PEPAX involves the use of a wider than normal baseline, but for a different purpose. Unlike hyperstereo, pepax does not try to exaggerate depth beyond normal vision, instead it tries to restore the depth and size of objects that would be seen at a shorter distance to the subject. The idea is to adjust the stereo base (parallax) in proportion to the zoom (perspective).THREE-DIMENSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHY Principles of Stereoscopy by HERBERT C. McKAY pp 47-48, 72 If a picture is taken with a stereo camera (or pair of cameras) and a 4X telephoto lens or 4X zoom built into the camera(s) is used, objects will be the size they would be at 1/4 the distance, but will have no where near the depth, which is why zoom is generally frowned upon in stereo photography. If, however, the base is also multiplied by four the normal depth is restored and the image looks normal. Because the size of objects is increased in proportion to the enhanced depth, there is no miniaturization effect as with hyperstereo, but the same telephoto compression seen in extreme zoom flat photographs also occurs. Specifically, there is a reduction in the relative sizes of objects at different distances so that objects that are further away appear to be larger than closer objects that are actually the same size.Long FL stereo photography - PePax Principle Note that this effect is negligible at lower zoom levels and most observers cannot distinguish between telephoto pictures taken with wide base and normal pictures taken with a normal base at an equivalent distance. So pictures taken at 40 feet with a 4x zoom and a 10-inch base will appear similar to pictures taken at 10 feet with no zoom and a 2.5-inch base. Note that when using this technique it is necessary to avoid objects that are significantly closer or more distant than the main subject so as to avoid excessive deviation that could cause the image to be uncomfortable or even impossible to view. =Shorter baseline for ultra closeups ‚Äì \\"Macro stereo\\"= A mineral specimen imaged with scanner. Anaglyph, red left. When objects are taken from closer than about 6 1/2 feet a normal base will produce excessive parallax and thus exaggerated depth when using ortho viewing methods. At some point the parallax becomes so great that the image is difficult or even impossible to view. For such situations, it becomes necessary to reduce the baseline in keeping with the 1:30 rule. When still life scenes are stereographed, an ordinary single lens camera can be moved using a slide bar or similar method to generate a stereo pair. Multiple views can be taken and the best pair selected for the desired viewing method. For moving objects, a more sophisticated approach is used. In the early 1970s, Realist incorporated introduced the Macro Realist designed to stereograph subjects 4 to 5 1/2 inches away, for viewing in Realist format viewers and projectors. It featured a 15mm base and fixed focus.Willke & Zakowski It was invented by Clarence G. Henning.Simmons In recent years cameras have been produced which are designed to stereograph subjects 10\\" to 20\\" using print film, with a 27mm baseline. Another technique, usable with fixed base cameras such as the Fujifilm FinePix Real 3D W1/W3 is to back off from the subject and use the zoom function to zoom to a closer view, such as was done in the image of a cake. This has the effect of reducing the effective baseline. Similar techniques could be used with paired digital cameras. Another way to take images of very small objects, \\"extreme macro\\", is to use an ordinary flatbed scanner. This is a variation on the shift technique in which the object is turned upside down and placed on the scanner, scanned, moved over and scanned again. This produces stereos of a range objects as large as about 6\\" across down to objects as small as a carrot seed. This technique goes back to at least 1995. See the article Scanography for more details. In stereo drawings and computer generated stereo images a smaller than normal baseline may be built into the constructed images to simulate a \\"bug's eye\\" view of the scene. =Baseline tailored to viewing method= When images are viewed on a small screen from a short distance, differences in parallax are smaller and the stereo effect is muted. For this reason, stereo images are sometimes \\"optimized\\" for this situation, by using a larger baseline. However, images optimized for a small screen viewed from a short distance will show excessive parallax when viewed with more ortho methods, such as a projected image or a head mounted display, possibly causing eyestrain and headaches, or doubling, so pictures optimized for this viewing method may not be usable with other methods. When images are intended for anaglyph display a muted stereo effect generated by a smaller baseline will help to minimize \\"ghosting\\" artifacts. =Variable base for \\"geometric stereo\\"= As mentioned previously, the goal of the photographer may be a reason for using a baseline that is larger than normal. Such is the case when, instead of trying to achieve a close emulation to natural vision, a stereographer may be trying to achieve geometric perfection. This approach means that objects are shown with the shape they actually have, rather than the way they are seen by humans. Objects at 25 to 30 feet, instead of having the subtle depth that one being there would see, or what would be recorded with a normal baseline, will have the much more dramatic depth that would be seen from 7 to 10 feet. So instead seeing objects as one would with eyes 2 1/2\\" apart, they would be seen as they would appear if one's eyes were 12\\" apart. In other words, the baseline is chosen to produce the same depth effect, regardless of the distance from the subject. As with true ortho, this effect is impossible to achieve in a literal sense, since different objects in the scene will be at different distances and will thus show different amounts of parallax, but the geometric stereographer, like the ortho stereographer attempts to come as close as possible. Achieving this could be as simple as using the 1:30 rule to find a custom base for every shot, regardless of distance, or it could involve using a more complicated formula. This could be thought of as a form of hyperstereo, but less extreme. As a result, it has all of the same limitations of hyperstereo. When objects are given enhanced depth, but not magnified to take up a larger portion of the view, there is a certain miniaturization effect. Of course, this may be exactly what the stereographer has in mind. While geometric stereo neither attempts nor achieves a close emulation of natural vision, there are valid reasons for this approach. It does, however, represent a specialized branch of stereography. Precise stereoscopic baseline calculation methods Recent research has led to precise methods for calculating the stereoscopic camera baseline. These techniques consider the geometry of the display/viewer and scene/camera spaces independently and can be used to reliably calculate a mapping of the scene depth being captured to a comfortable display depth budget. This frees up the photographer to place their camera wherever they wish to achieve the desired composition and then use the baseline calculator to work out the camera inter- axial separation required to produce the desired effect. This approach means there is no guesswork in the stereoscopic setup once a small set of parameters have been measured, it can be implemented for photography and computer graphics and the methods can be easily implemented in a software tool. Multi-rig stereoscopic cameras The precise methods for camera control have also allowed the development of multi-rig stereoscopic cameras where different slices of scene depth are captured using different inter-axial settings, the images of the slices are then composed together to form the final stereoscopic image pair. This allows important regions of a scene to be given better stereoscopic representation while less important regions are assigned less of the depth budget. It provides stereographers with a way to manage composition within the limited depth budget of each individual display technology.

Its site, Muns√∂, is a village and formerly an island in Eker√∂ Municipality, Sweden. Because of post-glacial rebound, this island in Lake M√§laren is now connected to the island Eker√∂. Muns√∂ Church lies not far from V√§sby hage Nature Reserve. The round church at Muns√∂ is one of a few so-called round churches in Sweden. History Traces of permanent habitations dating from the Bronze or Iron Age have been found in the area, and several of the larger farmsteads in the area are traceable back to the Iron Age. Muns√∂ Church was possibly built for one such farm, called Bona. The church dates from the 12th century. The exact date is unknown, but given the peculiarity that the church is fortified, its history has been connected with raids by Estonian pirates in the area in 1187. At the time, Bona farmstead was owned by the Archbishop of Uppsala, who may have commissioned the church. From the beginning, it was built to be able to serve both as a place of worship and as a defensive building. Above the church itself there was a large room which could house refugees in times of danger, and above this another floor designed for defence, with arrow slits in the wall. These floors have since disappeared. During the 14th century, the sacristy was added, and the church porch in the 15th century. The main circular room of the church received its presently visible, star-shaped vault in the 1470s. A burial chapel for the owners of Bona farm was added in 1651-58\\\\. Further additions were made to the western end of the church in 1704-08\\\\. At the same time the church roof was changed into the Baroque cupola and spire visible today. During a renovation in 1856, the church windows were enlarged. Architecture The medieval parts of the church are built by fieldstone and later additions are made by brick, today whitewashed. The church has a shake roof. Parts of both the entrance door and the door leading from the church porch into the church itself are medieval. The lower parts of the original, Romanesque entrance portal has been preserved in the wall between the church porch and the church. Internally, the round church room is covered by a star-shaped vault, except for the choir and the later, 18th-century western addition. The 17th-century burial chapel is likewise covered by a polygonal vault; from the chapel the medieval stair leads up into the church cupola. Among the church furnishings, the baptismal font is the oldest ( 1200). The church also houses four carved wooden sculptures, dating from the 1470s and probably made in the Netherlands. The pulpit is Baroque, dating from 1651-53, while many of the other furnishings are later. The stained glass window behind the altar dates from 1905. Among the more unusual items in the church is a decorated chasuble from the 16th century.

She served primarily as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named for Prince Rupert, British Columbia. Prince Rupert was ordered in October 1941 as part of the 1942‚Äì1943 River-class building program. She was laid down on 1 August 1942 by Yarrows Ltd. at Esquimalt and launched 3 February 1943. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 30 August 1943 at Esquimalt. Background The River- class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River- class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. War service 20mm gunfire from Prince Rupert striking water to port of U-575 After working up at Pictou, Prince Rupert was assigned to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force escort group C-3 as Senior Officer's Ship. She was used a trans-Atlantic convoy escort until November 1944. On 13 March 1944, Prince Rupert, alongside , and aircraft from American and British services, sank in the North Atlantic. When the U-boat was spotted by an RCAF patrol plane, Prince Rupert was detached from the convoy and sped to the sighting. There alongside the aforementioned units, she fought for five hours to sink U-575. In the end the U-boat surfaced and Prince Rupert helped carry off the survivors, saving fourteen of the sinking submarine's crew. In November 1944, Prince Rupert began a refit at Liverpool, Nova Scotia which was completed in March 1945. She returned to active service with escort group EG 27, based out of Halifax and remained with them until June 1945, when she sailed for Esquimalt. Upon reaching Esquimalt, Prince Rupert underwent tropicalization refit in preparation for service in the southern Pacific Ocean. This meant adding refrigeration, water-cooling capabilities and a change to her camouflage pattern. However this refit was cancelled when Japan surrendered. She was paid off there on 15 January 1946. She was sold in 1947 to Capital Iron & Metals Ltd. of Victoria, British Columbia. Her hull was stripped and expended as a breakwater at Royston, British Columbia in 1948.

Sergeant Fran√ßois Bertrand (1823‚Äì1878), known as the Vampire of Montparnasse, was a sergeant in the French Army. He was arrested in 1841 for necrophilia and jailed for one year. In 1856, he moved to Le Havre. In his later life, he worked as clerk, mailman, and lighthouse keeper. He died on 25 February 1878. Biography According to his birth certificate, Bertrand was born on 29 October 1823 in Voisey, Haute- Marne. Bertrand began dissecting dead cats and dogs early in life. He stated that his necrophilic impulses began in 1846, and were accompanied by headaches and heart palpitations. He progressed to exhuming the corpses of both women and men from graveyards, whereupon he would eviscerate and dismember them before masturbating. Bertrand would later describe his experience with the corpse of a 16-year-old girl: > I covered it with kisses and pressed it wildly to my heart. All that one > could enjoy with a living woman is nothing in comparison with the pleasure I > experienced. After I had enjoyed it for about a quarter of an hour, I cut > the body up, as usual, and tore out the entrails. Then I buried the cadaver > again. Between summer 1848 and March 1849, a series of bodies were exhumed and found severely mutilated in cemeteries of Paris. On 15 March 1849 Bertrand admitted himself to the Val-de-Gr√¢ce with gunshot wounds. A gravedigger at Montparnasse Cemetery overheard the news about Bertrand's injury, and realized that he must be the same person hit by his colleague's booby trap. (A different source states that Bertrand was wounded by a police bullet at the cemetery.) One of Bertrand's surgeons obtained a full confession. Bertrand was arrested and sentenced to one year in jail. Legacy Bertrand's case prompted Joseph Guislain to coin the term 'necrophilia'. He was also discussed extensively by other early theorists of necrophilia, including Richard von Krafft-Ebing and Havelock Ellis.

This attack occurs when XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser. This attack may lead to the disclosure of confidential data, denial of service, server side request forgery, port scanning from the perspective of the machine where the parser is located, and other system impacts. Description The XML 1.0 standard defines the structure of an XML document. The standard defines a concept called an entity, which is a storage unit of some type. There are a few different types of entities, external general/parameter parsed entity often shortened to external entity, that can access local or remote content via a declared system identifier. The system identifier is assumed to be a URI that can be dereferenced (accessed) by the XML processor when processing the entity. The XML processor then replaces occurrences of the named external entity with the contents dereferenced by the system identifier. If the system identifier contains tainted data and the XML processor dereferences this tainted data, the XML processor may disclose confidential information normally not accessible by the application. Similar attack vectors apply the usage of external DTDs, external style sheets, external schemas, etc. which, when included, allow similar external resource inclusion style attacks. Attacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or relative paths in the system identifier. Since the attack occurs relative to the application processing the XML document, an attacker may use this trusted application to pivot to other internal systems, possibly disclosing other internal content via http(s) requests or launching a CSRF attack to any unprotected internal services. In some situations, an XML processor library that is vulnerable to client-side memory corruption issues may be exploited by dereferencing a malicious URI, possibly allowing arbitrary code execution under the application account. Other attacks can access local resources that may not stop returning data, possibly impacting application availability if too many threads or processes are not released. Note that the application does not need to explicitly return the response to the attacker for it to be vulnerable to information disclosures. An attacker can leverage DNS information to exfiltrate data through subdomain names to a DNS server under their control. Risk factors * The application parses XML documents. * Tainted data is allowed within the system identifier portion of the entity, within the document type definition (DTD). * The XML processor is configured to validate and process the DTD. * The XML processor is configured to resolve external entities within the DTD. Examples The examples below are from Testing for XML Injection (OWASP-DV-008).https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security- testing-guide/assets/archive/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v3.pdf =Accessing a local resource that may not return= ]>&xxe; =Remote code execution= When the PHP \\"expect\\" module is loaded, remote code execution may be possible with a modified payload. ]> &xxe; mypass =Disclosing /etc/passwd or other targeted files= ]>&xxe; ]>&xxe; ]>&xxe; ]>&xxe; Mitigation Since the entire XML document is communicated from an untrusted client, it is not usually possible to selectively validate or escape tainted data within the system identifier in the DTD. Therefore, the XML processor should be configured to use a local static DTD and disallow any declared DTD included in the XML document.

Miranda is credited with spearheading the effort to push the Costa Rican Department of Social Insurance (Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social) from the capital of San Jos√© into smaller municipalities and rural regions. Education Miranda studied at Liceo de Costa Rica (Costa Rica High School) in San Jos√©. He obtained a bachelor's in science and letters in 1942 before going to study medicine and surgery at the University of Chile, where he graduated in 1949. He joined the Association of Doctors and Surgeons in Costa Rica in 1950 and began working as an intern San Juan de Dios Hospital in San Jos√©. Between 1951 and 1953, he studied at Cornell University and the University of Rochester. National work After studying in the United States, Miranda worked in various positions at San Juan de Dios Hospital, Central Hospital, and M√©xico Hospital, all within the San Jos√© area. He founded the Costa Rican Association of Internal Doctors. Miranda began working for The Costa Rican Department of Social Insurance (Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social), Costa Rica's national social security and health care system when it first began. Miranda helped plan the construction of M√©xico Hospital and served as its Chief of Medicine from 1971 to 1978. Between 1982 and 1990, Miranda worked as Executive President of the CCSS, serving under presidents Luis Monge √Ålvarez and √ìscar Arias. In this role, Miranda had a profound effect on the delivery of medical services to citizens, especially expanding its reach into rural areas. During his time working for the CCSS, Miranda was able to shepherd it through several economic crisis. He came up with payment schemes based on Britain's national healthcare system that kept the CCSS viable. Political philosophy Miranda is highly critical of recent developments to lower the CCSS services. While receiving the Rodrigo Facio Brenes Prize, Miranda claimed that society is becoming less just because minimum wages are falling and the previous guarantee of a national pension is disappearing. As such, Miranda left the National Liberation Party and joined the Citizens' Action Party. Awards Miranda was awarded a Meritorious Commendation from the organization Seguridad Social de Centro Am√©rica y Panam√° in 1983. In 1989, the Organization for Pan-American Health awarded him the Latin American Prize for the Administration of Health Services.

They were defined between 1908 and 1909 by Harry Bateman and Ebenezer Cunningham, with Bateman giving the transformation its name.Bateman (1908); Bateman (1909); Cunningham (1909) They correspond to the conformal group of \\"transformations by reciprocal radii\\" in relation to the framework of Lie sphere geometry, which were already known in the 19th century. Time is used as fourth dimension as in Minkowski space, so spherical wave transformations are connected to the Lorentz transformation of special relativity, and it turns out that the conformal group of spacetime includes the Lorentz group and the Poincar√© group as subgroups. However, only the Lorentz/Poincar√© groups represent symmetries of all laws of nature including mechanics, whereas the conformal group is related to certain areas such as electrodynamics.Kastrup (2008)Walter (2012)Warwick (1992), (2012) In addition, it can be shown that the conformal group of the plane (corresponding to the M√∂bius group of the extended complex plane) is isomorphic to the Lorentz group. A special case of Lie sphere geometry is the transformation by reciprocal directions or Laguerre inversion, being a generator of the Laguerre group. It transforms not only spheres into spheres but also planes into planes.M√ºller (1910), chapter 25Pedoe (1972) If time is used as fourth dimension, a close analogy to the Lorentz transformation as well as isomorphism to the Lorentz group was pointed out by several authors such as Bateman, Cartan or Poincar√©.Cartan (1915), pp. 39‚Äì43Klein & Blaschke (1926), pp. 253-262Blaschke (1929), Chapter 4Kunle and Fladt (1970), p. 481Benz (1992), Chapter 3.17  Transformation by reciprocal radii  = Development in the 19th century = Inversions preserving angles between circles were first discussed by Durrande (1820), with Quetelet (1827) and Pl√ºcker (1828) writing down the corresponding transformation formula, k being the radius of inversion:Kastrup (2008), section 2.2 :x^{\\\\prime}=\\\\frac{k^{2}x}{x^{2}+y^{2}},\\\\quad y^{\\\\prime}=\\\\frac{k^{2}y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}. These inversions were later called \\"transformations by reciprocal radii\\", and became better known when Thomson (1845, 1847) applied them on spheres with coordinates x, y, z in the course of developing the method of inversion in electrostatics.Kastrup (2008), section 2.3 Joseph Liouville (1847) demonstrated its mathematical meaning by showing that it belongs to the conformal transformations producing the following quadratic form:Liouville (1847); Liouville (1850a); Liouville (1850b) :\\\\delta x^{\\\\prime2}+\\\\delta y^{\\\\prime2}+\\\\delta z^{\\\\prime2}=\\\\lambda\\\\left(\\\\delta x^{2}+\\\\delta y^{2}+\\\\delta z^{2}\\\\right). Liouville himselfLiouville (1850b) and more extensively Sophus Lie (1871)Lie (1871); Lie (1872) showed that the related conformal group can be differentiated (Liouville's theorem): For instance, \\\\lambda=1 includes the Euclidean group of ordinary motions; \\\\lambda e 1 scale or similarity transformations in which the coordinates of the previous transformations are multiplied by \\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda}; and \\\\lambda=k^{4}/\\\\left(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}\\\\right)^{2} gives Thomson's transformation by reciprocal radii (inversions): :x^{\\\\prime}=\\\\frac{k^{2}x}{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}},\\\\quad y^{\\\\prime}=\\\\frac{k^{2}y}{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}},\\\\quad z^{\\\\prime}=\\\\frac{k^{2}z}{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}. Subsequently, Liouville's theorem was extended to n dimensions by Lie (1871) and others such as Darboux (1878):Darboux (1872), p. 282 :\\\\delta x_{1}^{\\\\prime2}+\\\\dots+\\\\delta x_{n}^{\\\\prime2}=\\\\lambda\\\\left(\\\\delta x_{1}^{2}+\\\\dots+\\\\delta x_{n}^{2}\\\\right). This group of conformal transformations by reciprocal radii preserves angles and transforms spheres into spheres or hyperspheres (see M√∂bius transformation, conformal symmetry, special conformal transformation). It is a 6-parameter group in the plane R2 which corresponds to the M√∂bius group of the extended complex plane,Kastrup (2008), p. 22 a 10-parameter group in space R3, and a 15-parameter group in R4. In R2 it represents only a small subset of all conformal transformations therein, whereas in R2+n it is identical to the group of all conformal transformations (corresponding to the M√∂bius transformations in higher dimensions) therein, in accordance with Liouville's theorem.Fano (1907), pp. 312-315 Conformal transformations in R3 were often applied to what Darboux (1873) called \\"pentaspherical coordinates\\" by relating the points to homogeneous coordinates based on five spheres.E. M√ºller (1910), pp. 706-712Kastrup (2008), section 2.4 = Oriented spheres = Another method for solving such sphere problems was to write down the coordinates together with the sphere's radius.E. M√ºller (1910), p. 706 This was employed by Lie (1871) in the context of Lie sphere geometry which represents a general framework of sphere-transformations (being a special case of contact transformations) conserving lines of curvature and transforming spheres into spheres.Lie (1872), p. 183 The previously mentioned 10-parameter group in R3 related to pentaspherical coordinates is extended to the 15-parameter group of Lie sphere transformations related to \\"hexaspherical coordinates\\" (named by Klein in 1893) by adding a sixth homogeneous coordinate related to the radius.Klein (1893), p. 474Fano (1907), p. 316 Since the radius of a sphere can have a positive or negative sign, one sphere always corresponds to two transformed spheres. It is advantageous to remove this ambiguity by attributing a definite sign to the radius, consequently giving the spheres a definite orientation too, so that one oriented sphere corresponds to one transformed oriented sphere.M√ºller (1910), p. 717 This method was occasionally and implicitly employed by Lie (1871) himself and explicitly introduced by Laguerre (1880). In addition, Darboux (1887) brought the transformations by reciprocal radii into a form by which the radius r of a sphere can be determined if the radius of the other one is known:Darboux (1887), p. 225 :\\\\begin{align} x^{\\\\prime} & =\\\\frac{k^{2}x}{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-r^{2}},\\\\quad & z^{\\\\prime} & =\\\\frac{k^{2}z}{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-r^{2}},\\\\\\\\\\\\ y' & =\\\\frac{k^{2}y}{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-r^{2}}, & r^{\\\\prime} & =\\\\frac{\\\\pm k^{2}r}{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-r^{2}}. \\\\end{align} Using coordinates together with the radius was often connected to a method called \\"minimal projection\\" by Klein (1893),Klein (1893), p. 473 which was later called \\"isotropy projection\\" by Blaschke (1926) emphasizing the relation to oriented circles and spheres.Klein & Blaschke (1926), pp. 246-253 For instance, a circle with rectangular coordinates x, y and radius r in R2 corresponds to a point in R3 with coordinates x, y, z. This method was known for some time in circle geometry (though without using the concept of orientation) and can be further differentiated depending on whether the additional coordinate is treated as imaginary or real: z=ir was used by Chasles (1852), M√∂bius (1857), Cayley (1867), and Darboux (1872);Darboux (1872), pp. 343-349, 369-383 z=r was used by Cousinery (1826), Druckenm√ºller (1842), and in the \\"cyclography\\" of Fiedler (1882), therefore the latter method was also called \\"cyclographic projection\\" ‚Äì see E. M√ºller (1910) for a summary.E. M√ºller (1910), pp. 706‚Äì707, see especially footnote 424. This method was also applied to spheresBateman (1912), pp. 328 and 336 by Darboux (1872),Darboux (1872), p. 366 Lie (1871), or Klein (1893). Let x, y, z, r and x', y', z', r' be the center coordinates and radii of two spheres in three-dimensional space R3. If the spheres are touching each other with same orientation, their equation is given :(x-x')^{2}+(y-y')^{2}+(z-z')^{2}-(r-r')^{2}=0. Setting t=ir, these coordinates correspond to rectangular coordinates in four-dimensional space R4: :(x-x')^{2}+(y-y')^{2}+(z-z')^{2}+(t-t')^{2}=0. In general, Lie (1871) showed that the conformal point transformations in Rn (composed of motions, similarities, and transformations by reciprocal radii) correspond in Rn-1 to those sphere transformations which are contact transformations.Lie (1871), p. 201ff; Lie (1872), p. 186; Lie & Scheffers (1896), pp. 433‚Äì444Klein & Blaschke (1926), p. 258 Klein (1893) pointed out that by using minimal projection on hexaspherical coordinates, the 15-parameter Lie sphere transformations in R3 are simply the projections of the 15-parameter conformal point transformations in R4, whereas the points in R4 can be seen as the stereographic projection of the points of a sphere in R5.Klein & Blaschke (1926), p. 253 =Relation to electrodynamics= Harry Bateman and Ebenezer Cunningham (1909) showed that the electromagnetic equations are not only Lorentz invariant, but also scale and conformal invariant.Kastrup (2008), section 1.1 They are invariant under the 15-parameter group of conformal transformations G_{15} (transformations by reciprocal radii) in R4 producing the relation :\\\\delta x^{\\\\prime2}+\\\\delta y^{\\\\prime2}+\\\\delta z^{\\\\prime2}+\\\\delta u^{\\\\prime2}=\\\\lambda\\\\left(\\\\delta x^{2}+\\\\delta y^{2}+\\\\delta z^{2}+\\\\delta u^{2}\\\\right), where u=ict includes t as time component and c as the speed of light. Bateman (1909) also noticed the equivalence to the previously mentioned Lie sphere transformations in R3, because the radius r used in them can be interpreted as the radius ct of a spherical wave contracting or expanding with c, therefore he called them \\"spherical wave transformations\\".Bateman (1909), p. 225, 240; (1910b), p. 623 He wrote:Bateman (1912), p. 358 Depending on \\\\lambda they can be differentiated into subgroups:Cunningham (1914), pp. 87‚Äì89 (a) \\\\lambda=1 correspond to mappings which transform not only spheres into spheres but also planes into planes. These are called Laguerre transformations/inversions forming the Laguerre group, which in physics correspond to the Lorentz transformations forming the 6-parameter Lorentz group or 10-parameter Poincar√© group with translations.Cunningham (1914), pp. 87‚Äì88 (b) \\\\lambda e1 represents scale or similarity transformations by multiplication of the space- time variables of the Lorentz transformations by a constant factor depending on \\\\lambda.Cunningham (1914), p. 88 For instance, if l=\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda} is used, then the transformation given by Poincar√© in 1905 follows:Poincar√© (1906), p. 132. :x^{\\\\prime}=\\\\gamma l\\\\left(x-vt\\\\right),\\\\quad y^{\\\\prime}=ly,\\\\quad z^{\\\\prime}=lz,\\\\quad t^{\\\\prime}=\\\\gamma l\\\\left(t-x\\\\frac{v}{c^{2}}\\\\right). However, it was shown by Poincar√© and Einstein that only l=1 produces a group that is a symmetry of all laws of nature as required by the principle of relativity (the Lorentz group), while the group of scale transformations is only a symmetry of optics and electrodynamics. (c) Setting \\\\lambda=r^{4}/\\\\left(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}+u^{2}\\\\right)^{2} particularly relates to the wide conformal group of transformations by reciprocal radii. It consists of elementary transformations that represent a generalized inversion into a four-dimensional hypersphere:Cunningham (1914), pp. 88‚Äì89 :\\\\begin{align} x' & =\\\\frac{k^{2}x}{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}+u^{2}},\\\\quad & z' & =\\\\frac{k^{2}z}{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}+u^{2}},\\\\\\\\\\\\ y' & =\\\\frac{k^{2}y}{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}+u^{2}}, & u' & =\\\\frac{k^{2}u}{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}+u^{2}}, \\\\end{align} which become real spherical wave transformations in terms of Lie sphere geometry if the real radius ct is used instead of u=ict, thus x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-c^{2}t^{2} is given in the denominator. Felix Klein (1921) pointed out the similarity of these relations to Lie's and his own researches of 1871, adding that the conformal group doesn't have the same meaning as the Lorentz group, because the former applies to electrodynamics whereas the latter is a symmetry of all laws of nature including mechanics.Klein (1910/21) The possibility was discussed for some time, whether conformal transformations allow for the transformation into uniformly accelerated frames.Kastrup (2008), section 5.2 Later, conformal invariance became important again in certain areas such as conformal field theory.Kastrup (2008), section 6 =Lorentz group isomorphic to M√∂bius group= It turns out that also the 6-parameter conformal group of R2 (i.e. the M√∂bius group composed of automorphisms of the Riemann sphere), which in turn is isomorphic to the 6-parameter group of hyperbolic motions (i.e. isometric automorphisms of a hyperbolic space) in R3,Fricke & Klein (1897), Introduction - ¬ß¬ß 12, 13 can be physically interpreted: It is isomorphic to the Lorentz group. For instance, Fricke and Klein (1897) started by defining an \\"absolute\\" Cayley metric in terms of a one-part curvilinear surface of second degree, which can be represented by a sphere whose interior represents hyperbolic space with the equationFricke & Klein (1897), p. 44 :z_{1}^{2}+z_{2}^{2}+z_{3}^{2}-z_{4}^{2}=0, where z_{1},\\\\ z_{2},\\\\ z_{3},\\\\ z_{4} are homogeneous coordinates. They pointed out that motions of hyperbolic space into itself also transform this sphere into itself. They developed the corresponding transformation by defining a complex parameter \\\\xi of the sphereFricke & Klein (1897), p. 46 :\\\\xi=\\\\frac{z_{1}+iz_{2}}{z_{4}-z_{3}} which is connected to another parameter \\\\xi' by the substitution :\\\\xi'=\\\\frac{\\\\alpha\\\\xi+\\\\beta}{\\\\gamma\\\\xi+\\\\delta} where \\\\alpha, \\\\beta, \\\\gamma, \\\\delta are complex coefficients. They furthermore showed that by setting z_{1}:z_{2}:z_{3}:z_{4}=X:Y:Z:1, the above relations assume the form in terms of the unit sphere in R3:Fricke & Klein (1897), p. 49 :X^{2}+Y^{2}+Z^{2}=1,\\\\quad\\\\xi=\\\\frac{X+iY}{1-Z}. which is identical to the stereographic projection of the \\\\xi-plane on a spherical surface already given by Klein in 1884.Klein (1884), p. 32; (English translation: p. 34) Since the substitutions \\\\xi,\\\\xi' are M√∂bius transformations () in the \\\\xi-plane or upon the \\\\xi-sphere, they concluded that by carrying out an arbitrary motion of hyperbolic space in itself, the \\\\xi-sphere undergoes a M√∂bius transformation, that the entire group of hyperbolic motions gives all direct M√∂bius transformations, and finally that any direct M√∂bius transformation corresponds to a motion of hyperbolic space.Fricke & Klein (1897), p. 50 Based on the work of Fricke & Klein, the isomorphism of that group of hyperbolic motions (and consequently of the M√∂bius group) to the Lorentz group was demonstrated by Gustav Herglotz (1909).Herglotz (1909) Namely, the Minkowski metric corresponds to the above Cayley metric (based on a real conic section), if the spacetime coordinates are identified with the above homogeneous coordinates :z_{1}=x,\\\\quad z_{2}=y,\\\\quad z_{3}=z,\\\\quad z_{4}=t, by which the above parameter become :\\\\mathsf{\\\\xi}=\\\\frac{x+iy}{t-z},\\\\quad\\\\xi'=\\\\frac{x'+iy'}{t'-z'}, again connected by the substitution \\\\xi'=\\\\frac{\\\\alpha\\\\xi+\\\\beta}{\\\\gamma\\\\xi+\\\\delta}. Herglotz concluded, that any such substitution corresponds to a Lorentz transformation, establishing a one-to-one correspondence to hyperbolic motions in R3. The relation between the Lorentz group and the Cayley metric in hyperbolic space was also pointed out by Klein (1910)Klein (1910) as well as Pauli (1921).Pauli (1921), p. 626 The corresponding isomorphism of the M√∂bius group to the Lorentz group was employed, among others, by Roger Penrose.  Transformation by reciprocal directions  = Development in the 19th century = Above, the connection of conformal transformations with coordinates including the radius of spheres within Lie sphere geometry was mentioned. The special case \\\\lambda=1 corresponds to a sphere transformation given by Edmond Laguerre (1880-1885), who called it the \\"transformation by reciprocal directions\\" and who laid down the foundation of a geometry of oriented spheres and planes.Laguerre (1881); Laguerre (1905), pp. 592‚Äì684 (collection or papers published between 1880 and 1885). According to DarbouxDarboux (1887), p. 259 and Bateman,Bateman (1910b), p. 624 similar relations were discussed before by Albert Ribaucour (1870)Ribaucour (1870) and by Lie himself (1871). Stephanos (1881) pointed out that Laguerre's geometry is indeed a special case of Lie's sphere geometry.Stephanos (1881) He also represented Laguerre's oriented spheres by quaternions (1883).Stephanos (1883) Lines, circles, planes, or spheres with radii of certain orientation are called by Laguerre half-lines, half-circles (cycles), half-planes, half-spheres, etc. A tangent is a half- line cutting a cycle at a point where both have the same direction. The transformation by reciprocal directions transforms oriented spheres into oriented spheres and oriented planes into oriented planes, leaving invariant the \\"tangential distance\\" of two cycles (the distance between the points of each one of their common tangents), and also conserves the lines of curvature.Fano (1907), pp. 318-320 Laguerre (1882) applied the transformation to two cycles under the following conditions: Their radical axis is the axis of transformation, and their common tangents are parallel to two fixed directions of the half-lines that are transformed into themselves (Laguerre called this specific method the \\"transformation by reciprocal half-lines\\", which was later called \\"Laguerre inversion\\"Coolidge (1916), p. 355Pedoe (1972), p. 256). Setting R and R' as the radii of the cycles, and D and D' as the distances of their centers to the axis, he obtained:Laguerre (1882), p. 550. :D^{2}-D^{\\\\prime2}=R^{2}-R^{\\\\prime2},\\\\quad D-D'=\\\\alpha(R-R'),\\\\quad D+D'=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha}(R+R'), with the transformation:Laguerre (1882), p. 551. :D'=\\\\frac{D\\\\left(1+\\\\alpha^{2}\\\\right)-2\\\\alpha R}{1-\\\\alpha^{2}},\\\\quad R'=\\\\frac{2\\\\alpha D-R\\\\left(1+\\\\alpha^{2}\\\\right)}{1-\\\\alpha^{2}}. Darboux (1887) obtained the same formulas in different notation (with z=D and k=\\\\alpha) in his treatment of the \\"transformation by reciprocal directions\\", though he included the x and y coordinates as well:Darboux (1887), p. 254 :\\\\begin{align} x' & =x,\\\\quad & z' & =\\\\frac{1+k^{2}}{1-k^{2}}z-\\\\frac{2kR}{1-k^{2}},\\\\\\\\\\\\ y' & =y, & R' & =\\\\frac{2kz}{1-k^{2}}-\\\\frac{1+k^{2}}{1-k^{2}}R, \\\\end{align} with :z'+R' =\\\\frac{1+k}{1-k}(z-R),\\\\quad z'-R' =\\\\frac{1-k}{1+k}(z+R), consequently he obtained the relation :x^{\\\\prime2}+y^{\\\\prime2}+z^{\\\\prime2}-R^{\\\\prime2}=x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-R^{2}. As mentioned above, oriented spheres in R3 can be represented by points of four- dimensional space R4 using minimal (isotropy) projection, which became particularly important in Laguerre's geometry.Fano (1907), p. 320 For instance, E. M√ºller (1898) based his discussion of oriented spheres on the fact that they can be mapped upon the points of a plane manifold of four dimensions (which he likened to Fiedler's \\"cyclography\\" from 1882). He systematically compared the transformations by reciprocal radii (calling it \\"inversion at a sphere\\") with the transformations by reciprocal directions (calling it \\"inversion at a plane sphere complex\\").E. M√ºller (1898), see footnote on p. 274. Following M√ºller's paper, Smith (1900) discussed Laguerre's transformation and the related \\"group of the geometry of reciprocal directions\\". Alluding to Klein's (1893) treatment of minimal projection, he pointed out that this group \\"is simply isomorphic with the group of all displacements and symmetry transformations in space of four dimensions\\".Smith (1900), p. 172 Smith obtained the same transformation as Laguerre and Darboux in different notation, calling it \\"inversion into a spherical complex\\":Smith (1900), p. 159 :p'=\\\\frac{\\\\kappa^{2}+1}{\\\\kappa^{2}-1}p-\\\\frac{2\\\\kappa}{\\\\kappa^{2}-1}R,\\\\quad R'=\\\\frac{2\\\\kappa}{\\\\kappa^{2}-1}p-\\\\frac{\\\\kappa^{2}+1}{\\\\kappa^{2}-1}R with the relations :\\\\kappa=\\\\frac{R'-R}{p'-p},\\\\quad p^{\\\\prime2}-p^{2}=R^{\\\\prime2}-R^{2}. = Laguerre inversion and Lorentz transformation = In 1905 both Poincar√© and Einstein pointed out that the Lorentz transformation of special relativity (setting c=1) :x'=\\\\frac{x-vt}{\\\\sqrt{1-v^{2}}},\\\\quad y'=y,\\\\quad z'=z,\\\\quad t'=\\\\frac{t-vx}{\\\\sqrt{1-v^{2}}} leaves the relation x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-t^{2} invariant. Einstein stressed the point that by this transformation a spherical light wave in one frame is transformed into a spherical light wave in another one.Walter (2012), section 1 Poincar√© showed that the Lorentz transformation can be seen as a rotation in four-dimensional space with time as fourth coordinate, with Minkowski deepening this insight much further (see History of special relativity). As shown above, also Laguerre's transformation by reciprocal directions or half-lines ‚Äì later called Laguerre inversion ‚Äì in the form given by Darboux (1887) leaves the expression x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-R^{2} invariant. Subsequently, the relation to the Lorentz transformation was noted by several authors. For instance, Bateman (1910) argued that this transformation (which he attributed to Ribaucour) is \\"identical\\" to the Lorentz transformation. In particular, he argued (1912) that the variant given by Darboux (1887) corresponds to the Lorentz transformation in z direction, if R=ct, R'=ct', and the k terms are replaced by velocities.Bateman (1912), p. 358 Bateman (1910) also sketched geometric representations of relativistic light spheres using such spherical systems.Bateman (1910a), see footnote on pp. 5‚Äì7Walter (2012), section 4 However, Kubota (1925) responded to Bateman by arguing that the Laguerre inversion is involutory whereas the Lorentz transformation is not. He concluded that in order to make them equivalent, the Laguerre inversion has to be combined with a reversal of direction of the cycles.Kubota (1925), see footnote on p. 162. The specific relation between the Lorentz transformation and the Laguerre inversion can also be demonstrated as follows (see H.R. M√ºller (1948)H.R. M√ºller (1948), p. 349 for analogous formulas in different notation). Laguerre's inversion formulas from 1882 (equivalent to those of Darboux in 1887) read: :D'=\\\\frac{D\\\\left(1+\\\\alpha^{2}\\\\right)-2\\\\alpha R}{1-\\\\alpha^{2}},\\\\quad R'=\\\\frac{2\\\\alpha D-R\\\\left(1+\\\\alpha^{2}\\\\right)}{1-\\\\alpha^{2}}. by setting :\\\\frac{2\\\\alpha}{1+\\\\alpha^{2}}=w it follows :\\\\frac{1-\\\\alpha^{2}}{1+\\\\alpha^{2}}=\\\\sqrt{1-w^{2}},\\\\quad\\\\frac{2\\\\alpha}{1-\\\\alpha^{2}}=\\\\frac{w}{\\\\sqrt{1-w^{2}}}, finally by setting D=x,D'=x',R=t,R'=t' the Laguerre inversion becomes very similar to the Lorentz transformation except that the expression t-vx is reversed into wx-t: :x'=\\\\frac{x-wt}{\\\\sqrt{1-w^{2}}},\\\\quad t'=\\\\frac{wx-t}{\\\\sqrt{1-w^{2}}}. According to M√ºller, the Lorentz transformation can be seen as the product of an even number of such Laguerre inversions that change the sign. First an inversion is conducted into plane \\\\pi_1 which is inclined with respect to plane \\\\pi under a certain angle, followed by another inversion back to \\\\pi. See section #Laguerre group isomorphic to Lorentz group for more details of the connection between the Laguerre inversion to other variants of Laguerre transformations. = Lorentz transformation within Laguerre geometry = Timerding (1911)Timerding (1911), p. 285 used Laguerre's concept of oriented spheres in order to represent and derive the Lorentz transformation. Given a sphere of radius r, with x as the distance between its center and the central plane, he obtained the relations to a corresponding sphere :x'+r'=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1+\\\\lambda^{2}}{1-\\\\lambda^{2}}}(x+r),\\\\quad\\\\frac{x'-r'}{x'+r'}=\\\\frac{1-\\\\lambda}{1+\\\\lambda}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{x-r}{x+r}, resulting in the transformation :\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\lambda^{2}}\\\\cdot x'=x-\\\\lambda r,\\\\quad\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\lambda^{2}}\\\\cdot r'=r-\\\\lambda x. By setting \\\\lambda=v/c and r=ct, it becomes the Lorentz transformation. Following Timerding and Bateman, Ogura (1913) analyzed a Laguerre transformation of the formOgura (1913), p. 107 :\\\\alpha'=\\\\alpha\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\lambda^{2}}}-R\\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\lambda^{2}}},\\\\quad\\\\beta'=\\\\beta,\\\\quad\\\\gamma'=\\\\gamma,\\\\quad R'=\\\\alpha\\\\frac{-\\\\lambda}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\lambda^{2}}}+R\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\lambda^{2}}}, which become the Lorentz transformation with :\\\\begin{align} x & =\\\\alpha, & y & =\\\\beta, & z & =\\\\gamma, & R & =ct,\\\\\\\\\\\\ x' & =\\\\alpha', & y' & =\\\\beta', & z' & =\\\\gamma', & R' & =ct', \\\\end{align} \\\\lambda=\\\\frac{v}{c}. He stated that \\"the Laguerre transformation in sphere manifoldness is equivalent to the Lorentz transformation in spacetime manifoldness\\". = Laguerre group isomorphic to Lorentz group = As shown above, the group of conformal point transformations in Rn (composed of motions, similarities, and inversions) can be related by minimal projection to the group of contact transformations in Rn-1 transforming circles or spheres into other circles or spheres. In addition, Lie (1871, 1896) pointed out that in R3 there is a 7-parameter subgroup of point transformations composed of motions and similarities, which by using minimal projection corresponds to a 7-parameter subgroup of contact transformations in R2 transforming circles into circles.Lie (1871), p. 201ff; Lie (1872), pp. 180‚Äì186; Lie & Scheffers (1896), p. 443 These relations were further studied by Smith (1900), Blaschke (1910),Blaschke (1910) Coolidge (1916)Coolidge (1916), chapters 10 & 11 and others, who pointed out the connection to Laguerre's geometry of reciprocal directions related to oriented lines, circles, planes and spheres. Therefore, Smith (1900) called it the \\"group of the geometry of reciprocal directions\\", and Blaschke (1910) used the expression \\"Laguerre group\\". The \\"extended Laguerre group\\" consists of motions and similarities, having 7 parameters in R2 transforming oriented lines and circles, or 11 parameters in R3 transforming oriented planes and spheres. If similarities are excluded, it becomes the \\"restricted Laguerre group\\" having 6 parameters in R2 and 10 parameters in R3, consisting of orientation-preserving or orientation-reversing motions, and preserving the tangential distance between oriented circles or spheres.Blaschke (1910), p. 11‚Äì13Coolidge (1916), p. 369 & p. 415 Subsequently, it became common that the term Laguerre group only refers to the restricted Laguerre group.Cecil (1992) It was also noted that the Laguerre group is part of a wider group conserving tangential distances, called the \\"equilong group\\" by Scheffers (1905).Blaschke (1910), p. 13Coolidge (1916), pp. 370-372 In R2 the Laguerre group leaves invariant the relation dx^{2}+dy^{2}-dr^{2}, which can be extended to arbitrary Rn as well.Cartan (1915), p. 40 For instance, in R3 it leaves invariant the relation dx^{2}+dy^{2}+dz^{2}-dr^{2}.Cartan (1915), p. 42, \\\\scriptstyle (x-x')^{2}+(y-y')^{2}+(z-z')^{2}-(t-t')^{2} is the power of the invariant tangential distance between two oriented spheres. This is equivalent to relation dx^{2}+dy^{2}+dz^{2}+dr^{2} in R4 by using minimal (isotropy) projection with imaginary radius coordinate, or cyclographic projection (in descriptive geometry) with real radius coordinate.Coolidge (1916), p. 422, \\\\scriptstyle \\\\sqrt{(x-x')^{2}+(y-y')^{2}+(z-z')^{2}+(r-r')^{2}} is the invariant distance between two points in R4. The transformations forming the Laguerre group can be further differentiated into \\"direct Laguerre transformations\\" which are related to motions preserving both the tangential distance as well as the sign; or \\"indirect Laguerre transformations\\" which are related to orientation-reversing motions, preserving the tangential distance with the sign reversed.Coolidge (1916), p. 372 The Laguerre inversion first given by Laguerre in 1882 is involutory, thus it belongs to the indirect Laguerre transformations. Laguerre himself did not discuss the group related to his inversion, but it turned out that every Laguerre transformation can be generated by at most four Laguerre inversions and every direct Laguerre transformation is the product of two involutory transformations, thus Laguerre inversions are of special importance because they are generating operators of the entire Laguerre group.Blaschke (1910), p. 15Coolidge (1916), p. 378, p. 382 It was noted that the Laguerre group is indeed isomorphic to the Lorentz group (or the Poincar√© group if translations are included), as both groups leave invariant the form dx_{1}^{2}+dx_{2}^{2}+dx_{3}^{2}-dx_{4}^{2}. After the first comparison of the Lorentz transformation and the Laguerre inversion by Bateman (1910) as mentioned above, the equivalence of both groups was pointed out by Cartan in 1912Cartan (1912), p. 23 and 1914,Cartan (1914), pp. 452‚Äì457 and he expanded upon it in 1915 (published 1955) in the French version of Klein's encyclopedia. Also Poincar√© (1912, published 1921) wrote:Poincar√© (1912), p. 145Roug√© (2008), pp. 127‚Äì128 Others who noticed this connection include Coolidge (1916), Klein & Blaschke (1926), Blaschke (1929), H.R. M√ºller,H.R. M√ºller (1948), p. 338 Kunle & Fladt (1970), Benz (1992). It was recently pointed out: (\\\\mathbf{m},R)\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{4}. An oriented plane P in E^{3} may be interpreted as the set of all oriented spheres which are tangent to P. Mapping P via this set of spheres into \\\\mathbb{R}^{4}, one finds a hyperplane in \\\\mathbb{R}^{4} which is parallel to a tangent hyperplane of the cone x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}-x_{4}^{2}=0. In the cyclographic model, an L-transform is seen as a special affine map (Lorentz transformation),...|Pottmann, Grohs, Mitra (2009)Pottmann, Grohs, Mitra (2009)}}  See also  * History of Lorentz transformations  Primary sources        Felix Klein (1884), Vorlesungen √ºber das Ikosaeder und die Aufl√∂sung der Gleichungen vom f√ºnften Grade, Teubner, Leipzig; English translation: Lectures on the ikosahedron and the solution of equations of the fifth degree (1888) * Reprinted in English translation by David Delphenich: On the geometric foundations of the Lorentz group *.   * English translation by David Delphenich: On complexes - in particular, line and sphere complexes - with applications to the theory of partial differential equations     *.

The books are set in the hills of Provence near Marseille in Southern France in the early twentieth century, and together they tell a tale of deception, betrayal and revenge. Manon des Sources was a Pagnol film released in 1952 for which he had also written the original screenplay, and he subsequently developed the two novels from his own 1952 film. The books were then remade as two separate films in 1986, Jean de Florette and Manon des Sources. Plot summary Jean de Florette is the story of ‚Äòle bossu‚Äô, a hunchbacked former clerk in a tax office who inherits a farm in the hills above the fictional village of La Bastide in Provence and, together with his wife and young daughter, dreams of making his fortune by raising rabbits. However his intricate plans and hard work are constantly thwarted by a relentless drought and the deception of his neighbours, the Soubeyrans, two grasping and unprincipled farmers who block the farm‚Äôs spring to trick the na√Øve newcomer out of his land. Their plans eventually succeed when Jean works himself to death and his widow is forced to sell the land to the Soubeyrans for a fraction of its value. Unfortunately for the farmers the dead man‚Äôs daughter Manon sees them unblocking the spring which would have saved her father and vows revenge. Manon of the Springs (Manon des Sources), which takes up the story several years later, is the tale of Jean de Florette‚Äôs daughter Manon, now reduced to living in a cave with a local shepherd and his wife. After locating the source of the village water supply she exacts a suitable revenge, both on the Soubeyrans for the inadvertent death of her father and on the other inhabitants of the village for the mean spirited way they had treated her family and helped to drive her father to an early death. After the suicide of the younger Soubeyran, Manon is persuaded by the village schoolmaster (who has guessed what she had done) to unblock the spring. She does this just as a village religious procession is being planned to ask divine intervention to restore the water supply. At the moment that the procession, led by the saint's image and the cur√© (and which Manon has joined), returns to the village, the water begins flowing again from the village fountain. At the same time, a stranger arrives in the village: an old flame of Manon's mother, from her old career as opera singer. The older couple marry, as does Manon and the schoolmaster. In a final ironic twist, it is revealed that the older Soubeyran, unknown to him until his last months of life, was the father of Jean de Florette. He dies at exactly the moment that Manon gives birth to a son (Soubeyran's great grandson), to whom his great- grandfather has left all of his property and considerable fortune. Chabrol said that at the age of thirteen he had heard this story from a peasant who lived in the mountains above his parents' holiday home near Aubagne (and thus near the fictional La Bastide).

It is a subspecies of Speyeria zerene. The Oregon silverspot used to inhabit suitable coastal habitat from northern California, through Oregon, into southern Washington. It can now only be found in the wild at a few remaining sites in California and Oregon. Conservation sites include Cascade Head and the Rock Creek WildernessRock Creek Wilderness - Wilderness.net in Oregon. The butterfly can also be found at Mount Hebo and Clatsop Plains in Oregon and at Lake Earl in California. In Washington, the butterfly is listed as endangered under that state's legislation, though it is now reported extirpated from this state. California and Oregon do not have endangered species statutes that allow the listing of insect species, so despite its precarious status, the Oregon silverspot has no protection in these states. It is on the Special Animals list created by the California Department of Fish and Game. Speyeria zerene hippolyta is in a clade of three closely related subspecies. In suitable habitat along the U.S. Pacific coast, it is the northernmost one found. Further south, Myrtle's silverspot (Speyeria zerene myrtleae) had a range along the coast from San Mateo County to Sonoma County, California, and Behren's silverspot (Speyeria zerene behrensii) had a range along the northern California coast. The coastal habitats used by the butterfly were kept in an early successional state by high wind, salt-spray and occasional wildfires, providing the open conditions required by the hookedspur violet (Viola adunca) which is the butterfly's larval host plant. In recent years, although the winds and ocean salt spray continue to limit other vegetation growth, the wildfires have been suppressed due to modern development in this habitat. The original habitat of open meadows has, over time, been replaced by forest habitat. Researchers have been testing methods of maintaining and restoring the grassland habitat in coastal preserves, these include prescribed fire. As it does take several years for the hookedspur violet to reach maturity a \\"stop-gap measure\\" is underway. A team consisting of the Oregon Nature Conservancy, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Lewis and Clark College and the Oregon Zoo gather female butterflies for captive rearing. The captive- rearing projects are underway at the college and the Oregon Zoo in Portland and the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle. After being hatched and raised at the college and the zoos, the young are reintroduced as pupae to the wild to augment the existing populations. After the release of nearly 450 silverspots at Mount Hebo in 2016, Karen Lewis, a zoo conservation research associate, said in a statement, \\"The goal of the recovery program is to help each population grow large enough to be self-sustaining, if it weren't for this program, three of the five remaining silverspot populations would likely be extinct.\\" See also *United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of threatened and endangered arthropods References External links * Oregon Silverspot Butterfly, Arcata Fish and Wildlife Office * Butterflies of the Northwest, Woodland Park Zoo Speyeria Butterflies of the United States Fauna of the Northwestern United States Endangered fauna of California Species endangered by habitat loss Butterfly subspecies ","title":"Speyeria zerene hippolyta"},{"id":"42475634","text":"Gaijin √† Go-Go is an American J-pop band from New York.

The number of band members varied throughout the years the band was active from the beginning five up to twelve members. Originally, the band planned to draw from multiple influences including French, Italian, Brazilian and 1960s Japanese music. It soon realized a scope that broad was not fitting, and settled on a 1960s Japanese pop culture for its inspiration. In 2002, the band self-released its first EP, Hello Copycat, which garnered it attention from Sony Music International, with whom Go-Go signed a record deal. While performing a gig at Don Hill's in Manhattan, Gaijin √† Go-Go was noticed by Sony Music executives, who signed them two days later. Sony hired Joe Blaney to produce the band's debut album. Go-Go released two full-length albums, Happy-55-Lucky and Merry-55-Round with Sony in 2003. The latter featured remixes of Go-Go's songs by Yasuharu Konishi, King Britt and Ursula 1000, and an original track recorded for Fuji-TV's broadcasts of New York Yankees baseball games. That same year, the band also contributed on Konishi's Atom is Born album. In 2006, the band's final album, Go-Go Boot Camp premiered at Brooklyn Botanic Garden's annual Cherry Blossom Festival.

A communist politician during the interwar period, he joined the Yugoslav Partisans following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia but defected to the Usta≈°e in mid-1941. He defected back to the Partisans in December 1941 and was made leader of communist forces in northwestern Bosnia during 1942. Following a political disagreement, he defected to the Usta≈°e yet again in February 1943 and was given command of 100 soldiers. He formed his own 3,000-strong Bosnian Muslim militia with the help of the Germans and Croats in late 1943. He agreed to align himself with the Partisans once again in early 1944, prompting Muslim anti-communists within his militia to assassinate him in May 1944. Early Life and political career Husein Miljkoviƒá was born in 1905 in the village of Trnovi, near Velika Kladu≈°a. He belonged to a Bosniak peasant family and never attended school. In his youth, he worked as a logger and construction worker. In the 1920s, he became a delegate to the parliament of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in Belgrade. His political activities led to him being fined and imprisoned multiple times by Yugoslav authorities. In 1937, he became one of the founding members of the Communist Party in Velika Kladu≈°a. World War II On 6 April 1941, Axis forces invaded the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Poorly equipped and poorly trained, the Royal Yugoslav Army was quickly defeated. The extreme Croat nationalist and fascist Ante Paveliƒá, who had been in exile in Benito Mussolini's Italy, was then appointed Poglavnik (leader) of an Usta≈°e-led Croatian state‚Äîthe Independent State of Croatia (often called the NDH, from the ). The NDH combined almost all of modern-day Croatia, all of modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of modern-day Serbia into an \\"Italian-German quasi-protectorate.\\" Miljkoviƒá became the leader of an anti-Usta≈°e uprising of mostly Serb citizens on Petrova Gora following the establishment of the NDH. He defected to the Usta≈°e in August 1941 and joined the Croatian Home Guard in Petrinja. He fought with the Croatian Home Guard until December, when he defected back to the Yugoslav Partisans and returned to Kordun. He was then transferred to the Vojniƒá branch of the Communist Party of Croatia (KPH). At the beginning of 1942, he became a member of the regional committee of the KPH in Karlovac. He was named commander of Velika Kladu≈°a following the communist capture of the town in February and became the leader of the Yugoslav Partisans in Cazin. Between March and September, he served as the secretary of the regional KPH committee in Cazin. He objected when the committee was merged with the KPH headquarters in Bihaƒá in September and was distanced from the regional communist leadership of northwestern Bosnia shortly afterwards. Having attained the rank of deputy commander, Miljkoviƒá deserted the Partisans as the Bihaƒá field battalion began retreating from Drvar towards Livno in February 1943. He returned to Cazin and surrendered to the Usta≈°e 11th Infantry Regiment. He then joined the regiment in fighting against the Partisans and took command of a unit consisting of 100 men. Miljkoviƒá's unit served under the 3rd Mountain Brigade of the Croatian Home Guard from June to September 1943 and was later incorporated into the 114th J√§ger Division of the Wehrmacht. With the help of the Germans and the Usta≈°e, Miljkoviƒá formed his own militia. It consisted of eight full battalions. Approximately 3,000 soldiers joined. The unit attracted Muslim conscripts from the Croatian Home Guard and united them under the motto \\"For Islam!\\". Miljkoviƒá won the support of a small circle of citizens of Velika Kladu≈°a and local Islamic religious leaders. The Partisans launched an unsuccessful attempt to destroy Miljkoviƒá's militia in November 1943. Under German protection, Miljkoviƒá began collaborating with the Chetniks against the Partisans. According to some sources, he was promoted to the rank of Colonel within the Croatian Home Guard at around this time. The Germans, Croatians, Chetniks, and Partisans all wished to reach their own individual agreements with Miljkoviƒá due to the large size of his militia. Miljkoviƒá began negotiating with both the Usta≈°e and the Partisans in late 1943. The Usta≈°e proposed that his forces align themselves with the NDH and form the Krajina Brigade, while the Partisans offered to accept Miljkoviƒá into their ranks. Miljkoviƒá accepted the Partisan offer in January 1944 and allowed for some of his troops to join newly formed Partisan Muslim brigades. Shortly after, his entire militia joined the Partisan 4th Corps and he was promoted to the Partisan rank of Colonel. =Death= Miljkoviƒá's agreements with the Partisans caused him to fall out of favour with the Germans and the Usta≈°e and he was killed on 27 May 1944. The affiliation of his killers is disputed. Historian Noel Malcolm writes that he was killed by pro-Usta≈°e members of his militia. Journalist Tim Judah states that his killers were Bosnian Muslims working either for the Usta≈°e or the Partisans. Legacy Miljkoviƒá is a controversial figure.

In other words the functor Exp from abelian groups to commutative rings is adjoint to the functor from commutative rings to abelian groups taking a ring to the group of formal power series with constant term 1\\\\. The definition of the exp ring of G is similar to that of the group ring Z[G] of G, which is the universal ring such that there is an exponential homomorphism from the group to its units. In particular there is a natural homomorphism from the group ring to a completion of the exp ring. However in general the Exp ring can be much larger than the group ring: for example, the group ring of the integers is the ring of Laurent polynomials in 1 variable, while the exp ring is a polynomial ring in countably many generators. Construction For each element g of G introduce a countable set of variables gi for i>0. Define exp(gt) to be the formal power series in t :\\\\exp(gt) = 1+g_1t+g_2t^2+g_3t^3+\\\\cdots. The exp ring of G is the commutative ring generated by all the elements gi with the relations :\\\\exp((g+h)t) = \\\\exp(gt)\\\\exp(ht) for all g, h in G; in other words the coefficients of any power of t on both sides are identified. The ring Exp(G) can be made into a commutative and cocommutative Hopf algebra as follows. The coproduct of Exp(G) is defined so that all the elements exp(gt) are group-like. The antipode is defined by making exp(‚Äìgt) the antipode of exp(gt). The counit takes all the generators gi to 0. showed that Exp(G) has the structure of a Œª-ring. Examples *The exp ring of an infinite cyclic group such as the integers is a polynomial ring in a countable number of generators gi where g is a generator of the cyclic group. This ring (or Hopf algebra) is naturally isomorphic to the ring of symmetric functions (or the Hopf algebra of symmetric functions). * suggest that it might be interesting to extend the theory to non-commutative groups G.

The shooting renewed debate about gun control. The debates focused on requiring background checks on all firearm sales (called universal background checks), and on passing new and expanded assault weapon and high-capacity magazine bans. Background On December 14, 2012, twenty children and seven adults were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. It was the deadliest primary or secondary school shooting, the third-deadliest mass shooting by a single person, and one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history. Initial response Within hours of the shooting, a We the People user started a petition asking the White House to \\"immediately address the issue of gun control through the introduction of legislation in Congress,\\" and the gun control advocacy group the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence reported that an avalanche of donations caused its website to crash. That afternoon, President Barack Obama made a televised statement offering condolences on behalf of the nation to Connecticut governor, Dannel Malloy and saying, \\"we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics.\\" Speaking at a December 16 memorial service in Newtown, Obama said he would \\"use whatever power this office holds\\" to prevent similar tragedies. By December 17, the White House petition had more than 150,000 signatures, and one week after the shooting it had almost 200,000, along with those on 30 similar petitions. A USA Today/Gallup poll conducted days after the shooting showed \\"mixed results\\" regarding public opinion on firearm laws. While public support for strengthening gun laws rose 15 percent compared to a similar poll in 2011, there had been \\"little change in attitudes about some longstanding proposals, including the outlawing of assault rifles.\\" A law requiring background checks for all gun-show sales was favored by 92 percent of Americans and a law banning the sale and possession of high-capacity magazines (defined by the poll as those capable of holding more than 10 rounds) was supported by 62 percent of Americans. A record-high 74 percent opposed a ban on handguns and 51 percent opposed banning assault weapons. White House actions On December 19, 2012, President Obama announced the formation of an inter-agency gun-violence task force headed by Vice President Joe Biden. The task force held 22 meetings and collected ideas from 229 organizations. The NRA and congressional Republicans said that violent video games were a large part of the problem, but those did not end up on the final list of recommendations. After meeting with Biden, the NRA issued a statement saying that it was \\"disappointed with how little this meeting had to do with keeping our children safe and how much it had to do with an agenda to attack the Second Amendment.\\" On January 16, 2013, President Obama announced a plan for reducing gun violence in four parts: closing background check loopholes; banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines; making schools safer; and increasing access to mental health services. The plan included 23 executive actions, signed immediately by the president, and 12 proposals for Congress. The executive actions signed by President Obama were: * Issuing a presidential memorandum to require federal agencies to make relevant data available to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). * Addressing unnecessary legal barriers, particularly relating to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), that may prevent states from making information available to NICS. * Improving incentives for states to share information with NICS. * Directing the attorney general to review categories of individuals prohibited from having a gun to make sure dangerous people are not slipping through the cracks. * Proposing a rule making to give law enforcement authorities the ability to run a full background check on an individual before returning a seized gun. * Publishing a letter from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to federally licensed gun dealers providing guidance on how to run background checks for private sellers. * Starting a national safe and responsible gun ownership campaign. * Reviewing safety standards for gun locks and gun safes (Consumer Product Safety Commission). * Issuing a presidential memorandum to require federal law enforcement to trace guns recovered in criminal investigations. * Releasing a report analyzing information on lost and stolen guns and making it widely available to law enforcement authorities. * Nominating an ATF director. * Providing law enforcement authorities, first responders and school officials with proper training for armed attacks situations. * Maximizing enforcement efforts to prevent gun violence and prosecute gun crime. * Issuing a presidential memorandum directing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to research gun violence. * Directing the attorney general to issue a report on the availability and most effective use of new gun safety technologies and challenging the private sector to develop innovative technologies. * Clarify that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) does not prohibit doctors asking their patients about guns in their homes. * Releasing a letter to health care providers clarifying that no federal law prohibits them from reporting threats of violence to law enforcement authorities. * Providing incentives for schools to hire school resource officers. * Developing model emergency response plans for schools, houses of worship, and institutions of higher education. * Releasing a letter to state health officials clarifying the scope of mental health services that Medicaid plans must cover. * Finalizing regulations clarifying essential health benefits and parity requirements within insurance exchanges. * Committing to finalizing mental health parity regulations. * Starting a national dialogue on mental health led by Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, and Arne Duncan, the secretary of education. The White House's proposed congressional actions were these: * Requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales, including those by private sellers that currently are exempt. * Reinstating and strengthening the federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 (AWB 1994) that expired in 2004. * Limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds. * Banning the possession of armor-piercing bullets by anyone other than members of the military and law enforcement. * Increasing criminal penalties for \\"straw purchasers\\" who pass the required background check to buy a gun on behalf of someone else. * Acting on a $4 billion administration proposal to help keep 15,000 police officers on the street. * Confirming President Obama's nominee for director of the (ATF). * Eliminating a restriction that requires the ATF to allow the importation of weapons that are more than 50 years old. * Financing programs to train more police officers, first responders and school officials on how to respond to active armed attacks. * Provide additional $20 million to help expand the system that tracks violent deaths across the nation from 18 states to 50 states. * Providing $30 million in grants to states to help schools develop emergency response plans. * Providing financing to expand mental health programs for young people. The proposals were opposed by the NRA and the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), and opposition was expected by Republican and some Democratic legislators. Advocacy groups actions On December 21, 2012 ‚Äì between the formation of Biden's task force and the announcement of Obama's proposals ‚Äì Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the National Rifle Association (NRA), expressed the gun-rights group's sympathy for the families of Newtown. LaPierre said that gun-free school zones attract killers, and that \\"the media demonize lawful gun owners, amplify their cries for more laws, and fill the national media with misinformation and dishonest thinking that only delay meaningful action.\\" He said, \\"The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,\\" and that debating legislation that won't work would be a waste of time. He called on Congress \\"to act immediately to appropriate whatever is necessary to put armed police officers in every single school in this nation\\" so that every school in America would be safe when pupils returned to school in January 2013. LaPierre announced that the NRA would develop a National Model School Shield Program for every American school that wants it. After LaPierre's press conference, the Brady Campaign asked for donations to support its gun control advocacy and asked NRA members \\"who believe like we do, that we are better than this\\" to join its campaign. On January 8, 2013, former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot and injured in a 2011 shooting in Tucson, launched Americans for Responsible Solutions to raise money for gun control efforts to counter the influence of powerful pro-gun groups such as the NRA. Congressional action =Proposed assault weapons ban= On January 24, 2013, Senator Dianne Feinstein and 24 Democratic cosponsors introduced , the Assault Weapons Ban of 2013 (AWB 2013). It was similar to the expired 1994 federal ban, but differed in that it used a one-feature test for a firearm to be considered an assault weapon, rather than the two-feature test of the 1994 ban. Gun-control advocates said the stricter test would make the weapons less appealing to gun enthusiasts. In addition, it would have banned: *the sale, transfer, importation or manufacture of about 150 named firearms; *firearms with \\"thumbhole stocks\\" and \\"bullet buttons\\"; *the importation of assault weapons and large-capacity magazines; *and large-capacity ammunition feeding devices (defined as those capable of holding more than 10 rounds). It would have grandfathered in weapons legally owned on the day of enactment and exempted 2,258 specific firearms \\"used for hunting or sporting purposes,\\" of which only 33 were semiautomatic centerfire rifles. Feinstein wanted the grandfathered firearms registered under the National Firearms Act, which currently registers machineguns, silencers and short barreled shotguns.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1iYl0coIOYhttp://www.c-span.org/video/?310086-1/senators- feinstein-blumenthal-react-nra On March 14, 2013, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved the bill, though it was not expected to clear the full Senate or the House. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid decided to leave the proposed ban out of the broader gun control bill, saying that it was unlikely to win 40 votes in the 100-member chamber and that it would jeopardize more widely supported proposals. On the morning of April 17, 2013, the bill failed on a vote of 40 to 60. It was supported by Democrat Reid and Republican Senator Mark Kirk, but 15 Democrats, one independent, and all the Republicans except Kirk voted against the ban. =Proposed universal background checks= The Manchin-Toomey Amendment was a bi-partisan piece of legislation that would require background checks on most private party firearm sales, sponsored by Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin and Republican Sen. Pat Toomey. The amendment, to , was voted on and defeated on April 17, 2013 by a vote of 54‚Äì46. It needed 60 votes to pass. State actions , only five states had passed stricter gun control laws, while ten states had passed laws that weakened restrictions on firearms. =Connecticut= In the early morning hours of April 4, 2013, the Connecticut General Assembly passed new restrictions to the state's existing assault weapons ban. Governor Dannel Malloy signed them into law later the same day. The law banned the sale or purchase of magazines capable of holding more than ten rounds of ammunition like those used in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and required universal background checks for all firearm purchases. Gun owners challenged the law, but federal judge Alfred Covello upheld the law, ruling it constitutional and writing, \\"While the act burdens the plaintiffs' Second Amendment rights, it is substantially related to the important governmental interest of public safety and crime control.\\" Gun owners said they would appeal. In February 2014, the Hartford Courant reported that Connecticut had processed about 50,000 assault weapons certificates, but that anywhere from 50,000 to 350,000 remained unregistered. \\"And that means,\\" wrote the Courant's Dan Haar, \\"as of Jan. 1, Connecticut has very likely created tens of thousands of newly minted criminals ‚Äî perhaps 100,000 people, almost certainly at least 20,000 ‚Äî who have broken no other laws.\\" Frank Miniter wrote in an April 2014 Forbes op-ed \\"that more than 300,000 Connecticut residents decided not to register their 'assault weapons,' moved them out of state, or sold them.\\" =New York= In January 2013, New York became the first U.S. state to act after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement (SAFE) Act passed in the state Senate 43-18 on January 15 and cleared the New York State Assembly after about five hours of debate on Tuesday, January 16. It was signed by Governor Andrew Cuomo one hour later. The act expanded the definition of assault weapons banned in New York, created a state database for pistol permits, reduced the maximum number of rounds legally allowed in magazines to seven from ten, and required universal background checks on all gun sales. A dozen Republican conference members voted for the measure, but its Senate Republican leader did not attend the signing ceremony. The NRA called the assembly's actions \\"a secretive end run around the legislative and democratic process ... with no committee hearings and no public input,\\" and said the law was \\"draconian.\\" In a related move, the state comptroller announced that the state's pension fund would freeze its investments in publicly traded firearm manufacturers. The fund's holdings in Smith & Wesson had been sold in December, after the Connecticut shootings. Provisions of the SAFE Act have been challenged. On December 31, 2013, a federal court judge struck down the act's limit of seven rounds in magazines capable of holding 10, but upheld its expanded ban on assault weapons. As of April 2014 that decision was under appeal, and another challenge, that the bill was improperly fast-tracked, was dismissed by a trial-level judge. The plaintiff said that he will take that decision to the New York Court of Appeals. Non-compliance with this new law has been reported in New York. Frank Miniter wrote in an April 2014 Forbes op- ed that one million residents own \\"assault weapons\\" and \\"high-capacity magazines\\" (which he says are political terms). He wrote that many had decided to practice civil disobedience and not register their weapons, a class A misdemeanor with a potential sentence of one year in prison. USA Today reported that some owners threatened not to register their weapons, and that some chose to bypass registration by modifying or selling them before the April 15 deadline. State police say they cannot report how many people have registered. By law, they must keep their database of assault weapon owners private. =Maryland= Late on April 4, 2013, the Maryland General Assembly passed Governor Martin O'Malley's gun control bill, the Firearm Safety Act of 2013. It bans the purchase of 45 types of assault weapons and limits gun magazines to 10 rounds. It requires handgun licensing and fingerprinting for new gun owners, and bans those who have been involuntarily committed to a mental health facility from buying a gun.

Biography Ismail was of Georgian origin, and became a Mamluk of the Emir Ali Bey al-Kabir in Egypt. During the Russo-Turkish War Ali Bey used the opportunity to declare Egypt's independence from the Ottoman empire. On Ali's behalf Ismail Bey suppressed a pro-Ottoman revolt in Lower Egypt (1768). Acting on Ali's orders he also invaded Hidjaz and subdued all of its ports and coastal towns north of Djidda (1770). When Ali Bey's most trusted general (and brother-in-law) Muhammad Bey Abu al-Dhahab betrayed him and marched against Cairo, Ismail Bey was sent out to intercept him but was forced to surrender and to submit (1772). After Abu Dhahab's death (1775) Ismail Bey rallied the remaining mamluks of Ali Bey but failed to prevent Abu Dhahabs comrades Ibrahim Bey and Murad Bey from succeeding him. Murad tried to poison him, however, Ismail and the Ali-Bey-faction (Alawiyya) managed to expel the Abu-Dhahab-faction (Muhammadiyya) from Cairo to Upper Egypt (1777). A few months later several Alawiyya-emirs changed sides. Ibrahim and Murad came back and forced Ismail to flee (1778).

Due to another Russo-Turkish War the Ottoman Empire withdrew the Turkish troops the next year. Ismail Bey asked the French consul whether France could send military instructors and training units. However, the French revolution made this impossible. Ismail Bey and almost the whole of his faction was wiped out because of the plague. After the Ismailiyya-regime collapsed, Ibrahim and Murad returned and took over the power again. Murad decided to reside in Ismail's palace.

The highway has an auxiliary route, VT 104A, that connects Fairfax and Georgia to the west. Route description VT 104 begins at an intersection with VT 15 in the town of Cambridge. The two-lane highway heads west parallel to the Lamoille River and crosses the Lamoille-Franklin county line into the town of Fairfax, where the highway is named Main Street. VT 104 crosses Beaver Creek and continues west between the south town line and the river to the north. South of the center of town, the highway curves north and meets the northern end of VT 128 (Browns River Road) at a tangent intersection. VT 104 passes through the town center between its bridges over the Lamoille River and Mill Brook; just south of the latter bridge, the route intersects Maple Street, which leads to the Maple Street Covered Bridge. The highway continues northwest and crosses Tracy Book and Swift Brook on either side of its junction with VT 104A (Highbridge Road), which leads west toward Interstate 89 (I-89) in Georgia. Near the northwest corner of Fairfax, VT 104 curves west and crosses the Mill River between the two St. Albans reservoirs. The highway passes under I-89 with no access then curves north to parallel the Interstate, during which the route briefly veers to the west of the town line into Georgia. After the short second stint through Fairfax, VT 104 briefly passes through the southwest corner of Fairfield before entering the town of St. Albans, where the highway is named Fairfax Road. The highway crosses Ruggs Brook and briefly becomes a divided highway around its intersection with St. Albans State Highway, a connector between U.S. Route 7 (US 7) in the south end of the city of St. Albans and a trumpet interchange with I-89 immediately to the east of VT 104. VT 104 continues north as Fisher Pond Road beyond its intersection with VT 36 (Fairfield Hill Road) and crosses Stevens Brook. The highway crosses over to the east side of I-89, crosses Hungerford Brook, and reaches its northern terminus at a T-intersection with VT 105 (Sheldon Road), which heads west toward the city of St. Albans and northeast toward Sheldon. Major intersections Auxiliary route Vermont Route 104A (VT 104A) is a auxiliary route of VT 104 that runs from US 7 in Georgia east to VT 104 in Fairfax. The two-lane highway, which is named Highbridge Road in both towns, begins at US 7 (Ethan Allen Highway) south of the U.S. Highway's interchange with I-89 in Georgia. VT 104A bypasses a loop of Highbridge Road and crosses an arm of Arrowhead Mountain Lake, an impoundment of the Lamoille River. The highway follows the right bank of the river, passes the historic Kemp-Shepard House, and passes under the New England Central Railroad. VT 104A crosses Beaver Meadow Brook and veers away from the river as it enters the town of Fairfax.

Regarded as ‚ÄúThe GOAT‚Äù the Greatest 212lb Bodybuilder of All Time. He lives in Boca Raton, Florida. Early life Lewis' interest in bodybuilding began at the age of 12 after discovering a book on Tom Platz. It was Platz's legs, he claims, that inspired Lewis to join a gym and start bodybuilding. Arnold Schwarzenegger was one of Lewis' biggest idols as a child. One day, when Lewis was home alone, he had scouted his father's shed and came across plastic weights, that his parents wouldn't allow him to use. Despite his parent's prohibition, Lewis would take the weights and hide them under his bed, performing various exercises every night with them, before his parents found out and took them back. This was his introduction to weight training. At the age of 15 Lewis stepped into a gym for the first time. He had played rugby at a high school level and he needed to gain some size for the sport. After coming across a local bodybuilder by the name of Steve Naylor, he was told that his physique had great potential. He took heed in the advice and trained with Naylor for a year, before he entered his first bodybuilding competition, the Junior Mr. Wales, which he promptly won. Lewis had a tattoo printed on his left arm at the age of 15, which he claims had stretched and morphed itself completely around his arm as they grew in size. Rugby also introduced Flex to weight training for increasing super power and he consequently has the ability to lift an enormous weight and hold it for long periods of time. He is superbly confident, greatly enjoying self- admiration and showing off his physique which is the result of a strict diet. Career Lewis' nickname, 'Flex‚Äô, originated on the rugby pitch instead of the weights room. Lewis was noted for flexibility during his years playing elite level rugby in his native Wales, and this allowed him to avoid any number of tackles. At Lewis' first competition, he met International Federation of BodyBuilding & Fitness (IFBB) Pro Neil Hill who convinced him to try the Y3T method of training. Hill helped Lewis master the rigors of diet planning and he won the Junior Mr. Britain title just four weeks later. After establishing himself on stage in the UK, Lewis headed to the U.S. where he trained at Gold‚Äôs Venice and Milos Sarcev‚Äôs Kolosseum Gym. As a seven-time winner of Mr. Olympia 212, Lewis is recognised as possessing the world‚Äôs greatest 212 physique. Lewis began to train seriously as a bodybuilder after his graduation, and made rapid progress. =Contest history= 2018 Mr. Olympia Weekend Bodybuilding: IFBB Pro 212 1st Place 2017 Mr. Olympia Weekend Bodybuilding:IFBB Pro 212 1st Place 2016 Mr. Olympia Weekend Bodybuilding: IFBB Pro 212 1st Place 2015 Mr. Olympia Weekend Bodybuilding: IFBB Pro 212 1st Place 2015 IFBB Pro 212 1st Place 2014 IFBB San Marino Pro: IFBB Pro 212 1st Place 2014 EVL's Prague Pro 212 Bodybuilding: IFBB Pro 212 1st Place 2014 IFBB Korea Grand Prix 212: IFBB Pro 212 1st Place 2014 Mr. Olympia Weekend Bodybuilding: IFBB Pro 212 1st Place 2014 IFBB Arnold sports Festival: IFBB Pro 212 1st Place 2013 EVL's Prague Pro 212 Bodybuilding: IFBB Pro 212 1st Place 2013 Mr. Olympia Weekend Bodybuilding: IFBB Pro 212 1st Place 2012 EVL's Prague Pro 212 Bodybuilding: IFBB Pro 212 1st Place 2012 British Grand Prix 212 Bodybuilding: IFBB Pro 212 1st Place 2012 Mr. Olympia Weekend Bodybuilding: IFBB Pro 212 1st Place 2011 Arnold Classic Europe Mens Bodybuilding: Pro Men 5th Place 2011 Mr. Olympia Weekend Men 202: Open 2nd Place 2011 New York Pro Championships Men's 202: Men's 202 Class 2nd Place 2011 Mr. Europe Grand Prix Men's Open: Men's Open Lis 3rd Place 2011 IFBB British Grand Prix Men's 202: Men's 202 List 1st Place 2009 IFBB Atlantic City Pro 202 Division 1st Place 2009 IFBB 202 Challenge (Mr. Olympia) 202 Division 5th Place 2008 Europa Pro Overall Division 7th Place 2008 Europa Pro 202 Division 1st Place 2008 Tampa Pro Open Division 7th Place Amateur Competition History: 2007 British Nationals (Earned Pro Card) Overall Division 1st Place 2006 Mr. Wales U90, Overall U90 Division 1st Place 2006 Mr. Britain U90 Division 1st Place 2004 Nabba Mr. Universe 1st Place 2004 EFBB Jr. Mr. Britain 1st Place 2004 EFBB Jr. Mr. Wales 1st Place 2004 Nabba Mr. Europe 1st Place 2004 Nabba Jr. Mr. Britain 1st Place 2004 Nabba Mr. Wales 1st Place 2003 EFBB Jr. Mr. Britain 1st Place 2003 EFBB Novice Mr. Wales 1st Place 2003 EFBB Jr. Mr. Wales 1st Place =Awards and honors= At the 2014 Arnold Classic he became the first man to be presented as winner of the 212 class.

He served as Director of the Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Professor and Director of the Institute of Sinology of Tsinghua University, Chairman of the Pre-Qin History Association of China, and Director of the Xia‚ÄìShang‚ÄìZhou Chronology Project. Early life and education Li was born 28 March 1933 in Beijing. After finishing middle school in 1948, he tested number one in the entrance examination of the electrical engineering department of the National Beiping High School of Industry. However, he was unable to attend the school because a medical examination misdiagnosed him with tuberculosis. After graduating from high school, he was admitted to Tsinghua University in 1951, where he studied philosophy and logic under professor Jin Yuelin. At Tsinghua, Li's main hobby was studying the oracle bones in the library, putting together pieces of oracle bones like puzzles. At the same time, scholar Guo Ruoyu () was writing a book on the oracle bones. Chen Mengjia, the oracle bones expert, thought the book needed more work, and recommended Li to assist Guo in his work. Li was thus \\"borrowed\\" by the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to become a research assistant to Guo and Chen. In 1952, the Communist government reorganized Chinese universities in the Soviet model. As part of the reorganization, Tsinghua became a specialized engineering college, and its schools of humanities, science, and law were merged into Peking University (PKU). Instead of moving to PKU with the philosophy department, Li chose to stay with the Institute of Archaeology, and never finished college. Career In 1954, Li moved to the Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (later of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences). In the 1950s, he systematically collated Shang dynasty oracle bones excavated from Yinxu, studied the events and historical geography from the oracle scripts, and identified oracle bones from the Western Zhou period. In the late 1950s, he studied the bronze inscriptions, pottery inscriptions, seals, coins, bamboo and wooden slips, and silk texts from the Warring States period, facilitating the formation of a new branch of Chinese paleography. After the major disruptions of the Cultural Revolution (1966‚Äì76), Li participated in the research of the major archaeological discoveries of Mawangdui, Shuihudi, and Zhangjiashan, making important contributions to the understanding of ancient cultural history of the Warring States and the Qin and Han dynasties. From 1985 to 1988, Li served as Vice Director of the Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, later becoming Director. Beginning in 1996, he served as Chief Scientist and Director of the government-commissioned Xia‚ÄìShang‚ÄìZhou Chronology Project. In August 2003, Li returned to his alma mater Tsinghua University as a professor. After 2008, he focused his research on the newly recovered Tsinghua Bamboo Slips. Influence Li was widely considered the most important Chinese historian of his time. According to the American writer and journalist Peter Hessler, a number of Chinese scholars told him that Li had the rare ability to do excellent research while satisfying the Communist Party. He was a prolific author, and several of his books have been translated into English, including Eastern Zhou and Qin Civilizations (translated by Kwang-chih Chang), The Wonder of Chinese Bronzes, Chinese Bronzes: a General Introduction, and The Glorious Traditions of Chinese Bronzes. In 1993, Li made an influential speech in which he called for historians to \\"leave the 'Doubting Antiquity' period\\". It became the manifesto of the \\"Believing Antiquity\\" movement, in contrast to the Doubting Antiquity School that had been highly influential since the 1920s. Scholars of this viewpoint argue that archaeological discoveries of recent decades have generally substantiated Chinese traditional accounts rather than contradicted them. Li himself favoured a third historiographical approach, which he termed \\"Interpreting Antiquity.\\" Criticism of Chen Mengjia When the Anti-Rightist Campaign began in 1957, the eminent scholar Chen Mengjia was labeled a Rightist and an enemy of the Communist Party for his outspoken opposition to the simplification of Chinese characters. Li, then a research assistant to Chen, published a review which criticized Chen's scholarship and attacked him as \\"arrogant\\" and having \\"an extreme tendency to boast\\". In 1966, at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, Chen was again severely persecuted for his ideas and committed suicide. In the 2000s, American journalist Peter Hessler interviewed Li and surprised him with questions about Chen Mengjia. In response, Li expressed deep regret of his action as a young man. He said that he was pressured by the Institute of Archaeology to write the review, and that he kept the criticism to the minimum and took care to only criticize Chen's scholarship and avoided applying more damaging political labels such as \\"Rightist\\".  Death  Li died in Beijing on 24 February 2019, at the age of 85.

It is one of the most lavish churches in Sweden from this period. There may have been an earlier church on the same site. The church is a single-aisled, rectangular building with a slightly narrower choir with a porch to the south and a sacristy to the north. The building is supported by buttresses in the corners. The brick vaults in nave and choir are original, a rarity in a Swedish country church at that time. The windows were enlarged in 1829. A notable item in the church is a grave monument, made in copper, over lady Ramborg. It displays a portrait of the lady and a warning that anyone who attempts to steal the precious monument will suffer the wrath of God. A major restoration of the church's limestone paintings was undertaken in 1870 by the Swedish artist, Johan Zacharias Blackstadius.

Freda began work on adapting the unfinished novel Dubrovsky which was written in 1832 by Alexander Pushkin and published in 1841, four years after Pushkin's death. The story had already been previously to adapted to film: first by Clarence Brown as The Eagle, and Dubrovsky by Alexsandr Ivanovsky. To develop the script, Freda worked with his friend Steno and Mario Monicelli. Freda later spoke negatively about his relationship with Monicelli, finding that when Monicelli became famous, he began ignoring Freda. Freda commented in his memoirs that he difficulty with the producers, stating that his film \\"went beyond verism or what the producers were willing to accept, and it consisted of totally different elements\\" Specifically, Freda recalled that the producers \\"could not imagine how our ciociari [the inhabitants of the Sout-East Lazio countryside] could play Cossacks.\\" Release The Black Eagle was distributed theatrically in Italy by Cinematografica Distributori Indepdendenti (C.D.I.) on 21 September 1946. It grossed a total of 195,000,000 Italian lire domestically in Italy. Film critic and historian Roberto Curti described the film as a \\"surprise hit\\" and became the second highest grossing Italian film that year, just after Rigoletto by Carmine Gallone. Curti was proud of the films success stating that the film \\"blasted off like a bomb to chase away the fetid miasmas of neorealism\\" and that he recalled the theater owner of Civitavecchia writing him a ltter to alert him when these productions would happen beforehand, as audiences were \\"so enthusiastic that they uprooted the theater's seats.\\" which Freda remarked that it would \\"not happen with Umberto D.\\" The film was released in the United States as Return of the Black Eagle and in 1952 in the United Kingdom as The Black Eagle. Reception The film was reviewed in the October 1952 Monthly Film Bulletin in the United Kingdom with an English-language dub and a 91-minute running time. The review declared the film \\"a piece of Italian spectacle\\" noting that \\"the treatment is energetic but unimpressive and the atmosphere far from credible.\\" The review found the dubbing poor stating that it made it \\"difficult to judge the film on its real merit.\\" See also * List of Italian films of 1946 References =Bibliography=  Testa, Carlo.

It is in the parish of Wyke Regis, close to that village but closer to Sandsfoot Castle, one of Henry VIII's Device Forts, built around 1541 opposite its contemporary Portland Castle to protect Portland Roads (principally Weymouth Harbour). It is privately owned, but has remained open to the public and is a favourite spot for swimming, sailing, snorkelling and diving. Above the beach to one side is the Castle Cove Sailing Club; this began in a clifftop chalet in 1923; it moved to its larger base in 2002. As at 2014 it has over 450 members. Amenities Further along from Castle Cove is another section of beach holding the Castle Cove Sailing Club. A refreshment kiosk has traded at Castle Cove since 1947. During the 21st century, a fast food outlet was opened on the beach. Ownership A previous owner, who ran the Shack caf√© for 18 months, decided to sell the beach by auction, which proved successful in 2012.. The purchasers of the beach, Lee and Karen Maidment, announced at the time their intention to maintain the beach as a local facility. Planning permission was granted for eight beach huts to be built here, lapsing in mid-2012. =Crowdfunded accessway repair= A landslip resulted in the removal of the steps to the beach in February 2013. With no footpath access to the beach, local Green Party member Clare Sutton organised a petition via Change.org seeking to prompt the Borough Council to work with the County Council, local landowners and businesses to find a solution. Launched on 22 March 2014 it took over 1,700 signatures by 7 April. The council's Head of Infrastructure had responded that no funding was available to stabilise the coastline and that it would cost a significant amount of money to rebuild the steps. Sutton and party members organised a public meeting in August 2014 and appealed to the local community to form a pressure group to reopen the steps. The Friends of Castle Cove Beach was formed, with the group becoming a charity three years later. The charity functioned by being inclusive and non-political, and by involving all the communities connected to the beach. They set up a Facebook page which attracted 1,200 supporters, ran social and fundraising events, and started a monthly newsletter. In 2018, the charity leased a strip of land leading to the beach, gained planning permission and started trying to fundraise ¬£35,000. In April 2019, new stairs were installed, through this means. It was opened by Brian Wilkins, who had been using the beach since 1938.

Ultimately, the film centers on dispelling the logic of the commonly asked question: ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt she just leave?‚Äù Private Violence premiered in the U.S. Documentary Competition program at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2014, where it won the Candescent Award.http://www.privateviolence.com/index.html#about The film was also shown at Full Frame Documentary Film Festival, True/False Film Festival, Dallas International Film Festival, HotDocs Film Festival, and the Doxa Documentary Film Festival. It won the Kathleen Bryan Edwards Award for Human Rights at Full Frame and the Silver Heart Award at the Dallas International Film Festival.http://www.privateviolence.com/index.html#about On July 16, 2015, the film was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in the Outstanding Information Programing ‚Äì Long Form category.https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/emmy-award- nominations-2015-full-list-1201537852/ HBO Documentary Films first broadcast Private Violence on October 20, 2014. HBO films and Women Make Movies are both distributors. Plot The film narrates the story of domestic violence survivors: Kit Gruelle, a domestic violence victim turned advocate who seeks justice for all female violence survivors, and Deanna Walters, whose estranged husband Robbie kidnapped and beat her for four days in the cab of his truck but was not arrested for it. Reception The film received mostly positive response from critics. In his review for Variety, Dennis Harvey said that \\"Cynthia Hill delivers a vivid portrait of one leading justice advocate and one survivor of horrific spousal abuse.\\" David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review and said that \\"Cynthia Hill's Private Violence offers an interesting procedural account and, along the way, gets to know the impressively dedicated advocate, Kit Gruelle, who sees it through to the end.\\" Brian Tallerico from Film Threat said, \\"Just by being truthful and honest with its subjects, Cynthia Hill's film feels like a call to action. Listen to it.\\" Matt Zoller Zeitz of Vulture called \\"Private Violence\\" \\"difficult to experience, essential to watch.\\" Seitz compares \\"Private Violence\\" to other documentaries about domestic violence, stating that \\"None can touch the power, sensitivity, and explanatory skill of this one. It's not just wallowing in pain, it's illuminating the social architecture that encloses and protects abusers and preserves the status quo.\\" Bill Moyer's included it among the 10 great social justice documentary films of 2014: \\"The domestic abuse relationship is so uniquely tragic because it happens behind closed doors where it abides by its own twisted rules and illogic. In director Cynthia Hill‚Äôs Private Violence, there‚Äôs hope in dismantling that terror. The film is a disturbing and bold depiction of a social issue that necessitates the abuse be so bad that help may no longer be relevant. Thankfully, as told here, there are advocates and women courageous enough to fight back so that healing can take hold.\\" Impact At the end of 2014, the Governor of South Carolina, Nikki Haley, watched Private Violence on HBO and reached out to film subject Kit Gruelle. The film provided incentive for Governor Haley to coordinate a screening for all of the legislators in her state. She was alarmed to discover that South Carolina had consistently been in the top five for domestic violence-related homicides.http://www.vpc.org/studies/wmmw2014.pdf Legislatively, almost all domestic violence offenses in her state were classified as misdemeanors. It did not make sense that these same perpetrators of ‚Äúmisdemeanors‚Äù were also killing women at alarming rates. Governor Haley started moving forward: she brought Kit Gruelle down to do a screening of the film in front of the entire state legislature. She retained Kit as her domestic violence advisor. Based on those conversations, a task force of representatives from 38 agencies that interface with survivors and their children around the state was formed, and tougher legislation has now been passed in the state with one of the highest domestic violence homicide rates in the nation. ‚ÄúThink about your daughters, think about your sisters, think about your mother, think about the 10 million children every day (nationwide) that see abuse in their families ‚Äì what are we doing for them?‚Äù Haley asked.http://www.thestate.com/news/politics- government/politics-columns-blogs/the-buzz/article13927241.html#storylink=cpy Accolades It received a 2015 Emmy nomination for \\"Outstanding Informational Programming.\\" References External links *Official website  2014 films 2014 documentary films American documentary films American films Films about domestic violence HBO documentary films Documentary films about violence against women ","title":"Private Violence"},{"id":"42476403","text":"Kasim Hafeez is a British citizen of Pakistani heritage. He is a speaker, writer and pro-Israel activist. He now lives in Winnipeg, Manitoba in Canada.  Early life  Hafeez grew up in Nottingham, England to Muslim Pakistani parents in a predominantly Pakistani Muslim neighborhood. While he states that his community was not particularly radical, but rather a hardworking new immigrant community of devout Pakistani Muslims but \\"Anti-Semitism was always in the background\\". Hafeez claims that in his household the most radical antisemitism came from his own father who would praise Hitler.  Radicalism  Hafeez says that growing up at a very turbulent time for the Muslim world there were monumental shifts taking place in the Muslim community where he lived. He states that Muslims became politically mobilized following two seminal events: the publication of Salman Rushdie's book ‚ÄúThe Satanic Verses‚Äù in the UK in 1988, and the war in Bosnia. Claiming that he became radicalized in his teen years from the propaganda being fed to him by radical groups and the casual organization he grew up around. He eventually became drawn to radical groups and embraced anti-Israel and Antisemitic ideas. As a student at Nottingham University, Hafeez joined the Islamic Society, where, he says, images of death and destruction perpetrated by Israel against the Palestinians were regularly screened at meetings. The images were never contextualized or interpreted, serving merely to fuel preexisting hatred, he says.  Israel Activism  The turning point for Hafeez occurred when he came across Alan Dershowitz's ‚ÄúThe Case for Israel‚Äù in a bookshop. He told the Times of Israel ‚ÄúI told myself that I would read his arguments, easily refute them, and that would be that\\". But refutation of Dershowitz's arguments proved to be rather difficult for Hafeez. Following months of intensive research on the history of Israel and the conflict, he was so emotionally distraught that he had to leave his work and his studies. Eventually Hafeez travelled to Israel in 2007 to see the reality, by his own admission still hoping to have his previous ideas validated. But what he saw in Israel had a life changing affect. He describes this in the Israeli newspaper Y-net: \\"I did not encounter an apartheid racist state, but rather, quite the opposite. I was confronted by synagogues, mosques and churches, by Jews and Arabs living together, by minorities playing huge parts in all areas of Israeli life, from the military to the judiciary. It was shocking and eye-opening. This wasn't the evil Zionist Israel that I had been told about.\\" According to Hafeez, it is \\"far from easy being a Zionist Muslim in England\\". Hafeez said he has been marginalized by his community and family.Myron Love. British Muslim Zionist pulls no punches. CJN.

Al Arabiya. 04 June 2012 Hafeez visited university campuses around the UK presenting his talk, \\"The Day I Stopped Hating Israel ‚Äì Confessions of an ex-Radical.\\"Nationwide Campus Tour with Kasim Hafeez In an interview with the Jewish Telegraph, Hafeez said: \\"It's not about being pro- Israel or pro-truth, I just want the facts to be heard. Israel is a democratic state. Muslims in Israel have more rights than possibly most Muslims in the Arab world and then there is the reality of the actual conflict. In the UK, most of us can't impact what will happen in Israel, we can't stop rockets falling from Gaza or forge a peace process, but we can tackle the delegitimisation and demonisation of Israel.\\" He went on to found the Israel Campaign which he says that he closed out in 2013 as he felt there were enough resources available, so he did not see the use to duplicate efforts. Hafeez He has spoken all over the world including the 2013 Global Forum on Combatting Anti-Semitism. Kasim has appeared on radio and television and print media.  Christians United For Israel  At some point in 2014 Hafeez joined the staff of Christians United for Israel and is still employed there now. With CUFI he has continued to speak on campuses and be published in print media. Judging from some of Hafeez's more recent speeches he seems to have matured from what he has called 'cheerleading' for Israel to trying to encourage dialogue and discussion while not shying away from the issues. In March 2019 Hafeez would address the United Nations Human Rights Council calling out the bias against Israel while referencing his own experiences being told lies about the Jewish State. Working for a Christian organization has raised question about Hafeez faith, while some written pieces as recent as March state Hafeez is a Muslim in his own social media he says that he is not a Muslim and does not want to be referred to as a Muslim Zionist  Other  Hafeez has used his social media channels to show support for US Veterans, mental health issues and the Semper Fi Fund References  External links  *Facebook Page *Twitter Page Year of birth missing (living people) Living people British Zionists British people of Pakistani descent Dissidents Muslim supporters of Israel British Muslims ","title":"Kasim Hafeez"},{"id":"42476421","text":"Martha Leticia Rivera Cisneros (born 30 October 1965) is a Mexican politician affiliated with the National Action Party.

It was released on 1 October 2013 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and on 18 November 2014 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and on 14 April 2015 for Microsoft Windows; PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions are scheduled for late 2021. The game is the online component of Grand Theft Auto V. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas (based on Southern California), Grand Theft Auto Online allows up to 30 players to explore the open world and engage in cooperative or competitive game matches. The open-world design lets players freely roam San Andreas, which includes an open countryside and the fictional city of Los Santos (based on Los Angeles). Players control a silent protagonist who arrives in Los Santos and aims to become the city's ultimate crime lord. Set months prior to the events of the single-player game (although later updates changed the time setting to a few years after the single-player campaign), Grand Theft Auto Online comprises cooperative missions where multiple players complete tasks to advance the narrative. The game also features numerous side missions and events, complex multi-stage missions called \\"Heists\\", and the ability to build a criminal empire by purchasing various businesses. Developed in tandem with the single-player mode, Grand Theft Auto Online was conceived as a separate experience to be played in a continually evolving world. At launch, it suffered widespread technical issues resulting in the inability to play missions and loss of character data. It initially polarised reviewers, being criticised for its lack of direction and repetitive missions, with praise particularly directed at the scope and open-ended gameplay. It won divided year-end accolades, ranging from Biggest Disappointment to Best Multiplayer, from several gaming publications. The game receives frequent free updates that further expand on the game modes and content, which has improved critical reception. The 2015 Heists update had been especially well received by the critics.  Gameplay  Developed in tandem with Grand Theft Auto V, Grand Theft Auto Online was conceived as a separate experience to be played in a continually evolving world. Up to 30 players freely roam across a re- creation of the single-player world and enter lobbies to complete jobs (story- driven competitive and cooperative modes). The Content Creator toolset lets players create their own parameters for custom jobs, like racetracks and deathmatch weapon spawn points. Players may band together in organised player teams called crews to complete jobs together. Rockstar Games Social Club extends crews formed in Max Payne 3 multiplayer mode to that of Grand Theft Auto Online. Players can create their own crews and join up to five total. Crews win multiplayer matches to earn experience points and climb online leaderboards. In Grand Theft Auto Online, players create a new character specific to the online world, which shows on the screen's Switch Wheel alongside single-player characters Franklin, Michael, and Trevor. The player- characters are designed by a genetics-related process. Greater control is given to the character's clothes and hairstyles. The protagonist arrives in Los Santos by plane and is picked up by Lamar Davis, who gives the character a gun and a car. An hour-long tutorial introduces the player to the various game modes, driving, fighting, and game progression mechanics. The story is not central in the multiplayer, though it serves as a prequel to the single-player story, where characters from the single-player are woven in. Similar to single-player, players can level up their character's attributes such as driving and stamina. Exclusive to GTA Online is a system of earning experience, usually by successful completion of activities. Accumulating enough experience to level up unlocks weapons, clothing, car customisations, and more advanced activities (such as parachuting and aircraft). Once unlocked, items need to be purchased with in-game currency, which can be earned or purchased with real money. Players can circumvent an activity's level requirements by joining a game with others of a sufficient rank. There are options to play alone or with friends, and an option for \\"Passive Mode\\", which makes the player immune to other players. Aside from the open world, there are three main types of set activities: racing (by car, bike, aircraft, or boat), Deathmatch (team or free-for-all), and objective-based Contact Missions (simplified single-player-like storyline jobs, usually cooperative). Online uses lock-on aim and emphasises stealth in firefights. \\"Adversary Mode\\" adds several asymmetric variations on these activities, including \\"Siege Mentality\\" where one team is besieged by another, and \\"Hasta La Vista\\" where truckers chase down cyclists (reminiscent of the truck/motorcycle chase in Terminator 2: Judgment Day). \\"Survival\\" pits a team of up to four players against ten waves of enemies, similar to the Zombies mode in Call of Duty: Black Ops. The Heists Update released on 10 March 2015 adds five co-op elaborate multi-part missions, each mission having several setup jobs leading up to the finale crime which is a high-profit job. The player who is the heist leader has to unlock each heist in order and pay the upfront costs, while receiving the largest payoff (at the end, if successfully completed) and getting their progress saved, while other players (the crew members) can join any setup/finale jobs without prerequisite and get paid a cut for each mission passed. The heists, all requiring four players except the first which is two- player, often assign specific roles to players such as driver, gunner, etc. and/or may split them apart, and a headset is recommended for communicating with other players. The game includes a content creation tool that lets players make automobile races and deathmatches. Players can choose the location, start and spawn points, and weapon and vehicle drops in deathmatches, and the location, route, race type, and player count in air, land, or sea races. Creations have to be tested against computer-controlled players before the mode is available online. The creations can also be published for others to use. Rockstar tags what they deem to be the best as \\"Rockstar Verified\\".  Plot  The player takes on the role of a silent protagonist who moves to Los Santos in search for new pursuits. Upon arrival, they meet with Lamar Davis, whom they befriended on Lifeinvader. After a street race against the player, Lamar introduces them to drug dealer Gerald and corrupt Armenian car salesman Simeon Yetarian for work. As the player begins to make a name of themselves in the city's criminal underworld by completing jobs for both Gerald and Simeon, they attract the attention of individuals like Trevor Philips, hacker Lester Crest, and Mexican drug lord Martin Madrazo, who also end up employing them. The first update to introduce a new story chapter was 2015's Heists, wherein the player is offered a new series of jobs by Lester. In addition to carrying out several bank robberies, the player helps Lester's associate Agent 14 with a few illicit operations, and assists Trevor with a major drug deal by stealing the drugs he is going to sell from a number of gangs. In Lowriders, Lamar returns with his own series of missions, wherein the player sabotages rival gangs to help him rise to power. However, this only leads to Lamar falling out with his own gang, so he attempts to earn back their trust, with the player's help. With the addition of the updates Executives and Other Criminals and Bikers, the player can form or join a criminal organization and motorcycle club, respectively. They purchase an office and clubhouse to use as their main headquarters, and engage in various illegal activities to earn money, while expanding their criminal empire by buying new assets, such as drug labs and warehouses. The game shifts to 2017 in Gunrunning, wherein the player purchases a bunker and starts a gunrunning operation alongside Agent 14. In Smuggler's Run, the player also starts a smuggling operation with Trevor's former associate Ron Jakowski after the purchase of a hangar. In The Doomsday Heist, Lester contacts the player again and asks them to purchase an ex-government facility, whereupon he introduces them to billionaire Avon Hertz and his artificial intelligence network Cliffford, whom they assist in preventing a doomsday plot. Soon, the International Affairs Agency (IAA), including Agent 14, joins forces with them to help combat a rogue Russian special ops unit led by a man named Bogdan. However, upon eliminating them save for Bogdan himself, Avon and Cliffford betray the player, Lester, and the IAA, and reveal that they tricked them into helping them gain access to the state's defence system, which they intend to use to trigger a nuclear armageddon. Reluctantly joining forces with Bogdan, the group works to thwart Avon and Cliffford's plot, which they ultimately succeed in doing, after the player kills them both while raiding their hidden facility. After Hours changes the time setting to 2018 and sees the player working with nightclub entrepreneur \\"Gay\\" Tony Prince to open a successful nightclub in Los Santos, doing missions to increase its popularity or to recruit various famous DJs. Additionally, the player can use the nightclub's warehouse for their illicit operations, and receive new jobs from Simeon and Lester's former assistant Paige Harris. In The Diamond Casino & Resort, set in 2019, the player buys a penthouse at the recently opened casino of the same name, only for its manager, Agatha Baker, to enlist their help with the various problems the casino is facing; most notably, Texan businessman Avery Duggan, who plans a hostile takeover. The player eventually kills Avery after receiving a tip from his nephew Thornton, who is also interested in buying the casino and promises the staff peace if they give him ownership. Following Avery's death, Thornton buys the casino and removes the troublesome staff. In The Diamond Casino Heist, Georgina Cheng, sister of former casino owner Tao, enlists the player and a retired Lester to rob the casino in retaliation for Thornton tricking Tao into selling it to him. The heist is carried out successfully, humiliating Thornton, while Lester enters a relationship with Georgina. In Gerald's Last Play, set in 2020, the player is offered a new series of missions by Gerald, who is facing opposition from rival gangs and asks for their help in dealing with them. In Los Santos Summer Special, the player's personal yacht comes under attack from the Kkangpae. Under the coordination of the yacht's captain, Brendan Darcy, the player retaliates against the gang, ultimately killing their leader and ending the conflict.  Development  Grand Theft Auto Online launched on 1 October 2013, two weeks after the release of Grand Theft Auto V. Many players reported that they had difficulties connecting to the game's servers and the Social Club web service, and others further reported that the game would freeze while loading early missions. Rockstar released a technical patch on 5 October in an effort to resolve the issues. The microtransaction system, which allows players to purchase game content using real money, was also suspended as a fail-safe. Problems persisted the second week following launch, and some players reported their player-character progress as having disappeared. Another technical patch was released on 10 October combating the issues, and players experiencing issues were told not to recreate their multiplayer avatars. As recompense for the technical issues, Rockstar offered a stimulus of GTA $500,000 (in-game currency) to the accounts of all players connected to Online since launch. Rockstar announced in September 2015 that the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the online mode will no longer receive any new additional content, due to limitation in the console capacity. This was criticised by Forbes writer Paul Tassi, who felt that Rockstar was \\"cutting out a lot of potential customers\\" who continued to play on the older systems, adding that the re- releases on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were lacking in additional content. A standalone version of Grand Theft Auto Online will be released for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X in late 2021; it will be free on the former for the first three months.  Additional content  Post-release content is continually added to Grand Theft Auto Online through free title updates. =2013= The Beach Bum update, released on 19 November 2013, added more beach-themed jobs and customisation content for players.

The in-game gambling activities are not available in certain regions, including a few US states, due to differing laws and regulations. The Diamond Casino Heist, released on 12 December 2019, added a new heist, which features three different approaches and a more interactive mission design. The heist is unlocked after the purchase of an arcade, which the player can customise to their liking. The update also introduced 20 new vehicles, two weapons, several clothing items, minigames that can be played at the arcades, and an in-game radio station curated by Detroit rapper Danny Brown and British rapper Skepta. =2020= Gerald's Last Play is a series of six cooperative missions given by Gerald that were added on 23 April 2020, as part of The Diamond Casino Heist update. The Los Santos Summer Special update was released on 11 August, and added new cooperative missions, vehicles, Adversary modes, and race tracks. An update scheduled for late 2020 will feature \\"a take on Heists in an entirely new location\\".  Reception  Many reviewers bemoaned their initial play experience as Grand Theft Auto Online suffered widespread technical issues at launch. Destructoids Chris Carter felt the \\"messy launch\\" should have been delayed and IGN's Keza MacDonald lamented her \\"disastrous\\" play sessions. Digital Spy's Liam Martin lost his character data and considered the technical issues dwarfed pre-launch anticipation. Some reviewers generally praised the game's open-ended and dynamic content; VideoGamer.com's Jon Denton thought the gameplay's \\"endlessness\\" made up for its problems and Digital Spy's Martin complimented the game's scope. Its PlayStation 4 and Xbox One re-release received similar critical reactions. IGN's Dan Stapleton reported low player counts in matches, long wait times in lobbies, server disconnection and occasional crashes. \\"Because of that,\\" he wrote, \\"I can't strongly recommend ... the multiplayer experience alone\\". VideoGamer.com found progression more streamlined and balanced than before and thought the \\"grind of just doing PvP until co-op Jobs arrive with regularity\\" was lost. However, they noted frequent server disconnection, especially during load screens. Game Informers Andrew Reiner reported \\"minimal lag or issues in the expanded firefights and races\\". Other game aspects received similar criticism. The character creation system was panned as unintuitive with resulting unattractive avatars. IGN's MacDonald thought the gameplay's \\"addictive rhythm\\" eventually faltered as errands became a monotony. GameSpot's Carolyn Petit thought the game's early mission palette was marred by \\"bland last team standing deathmatches\\". Eurogamers Rich Stanton found cooperative gameplay repetitive as players completed the same menial objective cycle. GameSpot's Mark Walton thought the frenetic action lacked direction, with PvP an \\"unending cycle of pointless slaughter\\". He considered the reputation system a weak deterrent against foul play and thought the unbalanced game economy was further hindered by low mission payouts. Reception has improved over time. VG247s Patrick Garratt felt the San Andreas Flight School update incentivised player engagement with the oft-neglected aircraft missions by offering more liberal reward payouts. Digital Spy's Martin thought the Heists update encouraged teamwork and \\"pinpoint coordination\\", while IGN's Ryan McCaffrey found high replay value in the heists' volatile action. Eurogamers Stanton enjoyed the strategic planning necessary to pull off a successful heist and thought players were required to think on their feet and adapt to changing scenarios. He further noted occasional gameplay pacing issues and technical hiccoughs such as mid-mission server disconnection. The game won Best Multiplayer at the 10th British Academy Games Awards and from GameTrailers. Game Revolution and Hardcore Gamer nominated it for Biggest Disappointment. At the 2019 Golden Joystick Awards, the game was nominated for Still Playing and won Best Game Expansion for The Diamond Casino & Resort. Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar's parent company, stated that by February 2014, 70 percent of players with Internet access had played Grand Theft Auto Online, and that the game's microtransactions system was the largest contributor to the company's digital revenue since the launch of Grand Theft Auto Online.

A resident of a nearby subdivision called police at 3:28 p.m. to report that a man had been camping on the mountain behind his house for the previous month, a violation of local regulations. Two Open Space officers were the first to respond. They approached Boyd as he lay under a sheet of plastic; Boyd, mentally ill with a diagnosis of schizo-affective disorder, became irate, wanting to know why the \\"raid\\". When an officer tried to pat him down, he produced two pocket knives, threatening the officers with them. The caller watched the confrontation from his second-story window and later testified that Boyd threatened the officers. The Open Space officers called for backup and Albuquerque police and New Mexico State police responded. A police officer with crisis intervention training testified that he had made some progress with Boyd, but that his supervisor pulled him off and sent him to secure the perimeter of the standoff location. Officer Mikal Monette testified that Boyd never did drop his knives and surrender, but did put them away and agreed to keep his hands out of his pockets.APD negotiator at Boyd scene says he was making ‚Äòprogress‚Äô, Albuquerque Journal, Colleen Heild, September 27, 2016. Retrieved October 6, 2016. K-9 officer Scott Weimerskirch stepped into the role of negotiator and supervisor, he said, because there was no dialogue taking place when he arrived. Boyd eventually said he would depart, picked up some of his possessions, and took a step downhill. An officer said \\"Do it.\\" (referring to the use of a stun grenade). Sandy threw a Stun grenade at Boyd , and Rick Ingram, the acting ROP sergeant at the site, fired his Taser shotgun, but it did not have any noticeable effect on Boyd. At the same time Weimerskirch sent the dog to bite him, then ran to the dog when it attacked the blue bag rather than Boyd. Startled, Boyd produced the knives again. Perez and Sandy testified that they felt he posed an imminent threat to Weimerskirch. Sandy said he moved closer to cover the dog and its handler. As officers approached, Boyd turned a quarter turn to his left and was shot. Boyd fell forward, face first, away from the officers, wheezing but still holding a knife in each hand. When he did not respond to commands to drop the knives, another officer fired three beanbag shotgun rounds which struck his buttock and the police dog was again sent to bite him. Boyd arrived at the University of New Mexico Hospital emergency room at 8:15 p.m., underwent extensive surgery, and was pronounced dead of massive trauma at 2:55 a.m. the next morning. Surgeons had amputated his right arm, removed his spleen, part of one lung and part of his colon in their efforts to save his life. A preliminary hearing was held in August 2015, and the trial of two police officers charged with second-degree murder in Boyd's death began on September 20, 2016. The trial concluded with Judge Alicia Hadfield declaring a mistrial on October 11, 2016. The jury deadlocked with three voting guilty and nine voting not guilty. The jury deliberated for two days after hearing 12 days of testimony in state district court in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In February 2017, Raul Torrez, the Bernalillo County District Attorney, after having several prosecutors around the state review the case, announced that he would not refile charges against Officers Sandy or Perez. In July 2017 the United States Attorney's Office in New Mexico said, \\"After a careful and thorough review into the facts surrounding the shooting, federal investigators determined that there is insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, a violation of the federal statute,\\" ending the inquiry into possible criminal civil rights violations. Sandy retired from the Department. Perez was fired but appealed his termination. He won his arbitration and subsequently returned to work at the Department in May 2017. He was assigned to a desk job for a year and was barred from responding to patrol calls or providing services. He was awarded back pay and benefits in the amount of $143,159.Cop Fired After Fatal Shooting Gets His Job Back, Plus $140,000, Huffington Post, Nick Wing, June 9, 2017. Retrieved March 10, 2018. Background James Matthew \\"Abba\\" Boyd, 38, was 6'1\\" and homeless. Authorities said he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia. He had been a prisoner in the Bernalillo County Jail in Albuquerque and the Do√±a Ana County Jail in Las Cruces, New Mexico. He had also been transported to a psychiatric hospital. The last lawyer to represent Boyd, John McCall, says he had no doubt that Boyd was mentally ill. He said, the New Mexico Behavioral Health Institute, the state mental health hospital in Las Vegas, New Mexico, determined that Boyd was not dangerous, and also that no treatment existed that would render him competent to stand trial. Therefore, they released him. McCall said Boyd was creative but clearly delusional.James Boyd's Dark Journey, Albuquerque Journal, Rick Nathanson, March 30, 2014. Retrieved September 28, 2016. A cousin remembered him fondly from visits to an aunt's farm that allowed them both to escape their families for a while. Boyd's cousin described him as funny, sensitive and intelligent. Boyd's alcoholic mother and physically abusive father lost custody of him when he was five; consequently he was in foster homes by the time he was five, and there he was sexually abused. He entered the juvenile justice system at fifteen, where he remained for two years. He was arrested again soon after turning eighteen. Those charges were eventually dropped, but by then he had spit jalape√±o at a jailer's eyes and tried to escape. By the time his family got Boyd a lawyer for the new charges, he had already entered a guilty plea and was waiting to be sentenced. Boyd understood by then that he was mentally ill and asked at his mental health evaluation to receive probation, counseling and job training. But he was found competent to stand trial; he was convicted and sentenced to ten and a half years in jail. All his appeals were denied, and he spent seven years in prison. Todd Holmes, the Alamogordo lawyer who tried to prevent his incarceration in that case, defended Boyd again in 2001. Boyd had been arrested trying to enter Holloman Air Force Base, claiming he was on a mission from former President Gerald Ford that involved national security. Boyd's mental deterioration while in prison was evident to Holmes. He says that, after Boyd's release, the man began to identify as \\"Abba Mobus Abadon,\\" a name derived from \\"God\\" and the Hebrew word for \\"a bottomless pit\\". In January 2002, Boyd was arrested while breaking into the Las Cruces offices of the FBI. In 2005 he was arrested for assault after he told a man in downtown Albuquerque's Civic Plaza \\"I am God and I want to hurt you.\\" Charges were dropped four months later. Boyd was arrested again in 2007, for refusing to leave a fire station. He had told firefighters that he was a government agent and wanted to send them to hell. At the jail, he punched a corrections officer. In 2009, he got into a fight at St. Martin's, an Albuquerque soup kitchen, and cut another man with a box cutter. In 2010, staffers at the downtown library called police because Boyd was telling people that he was God, frightening them. He \\"was charged with breaking an Albuquerque police officer's nose during [the] scuffle.\\" While incarcerated, Boyd was charged with breaking a window at the jail. He later said guards had refused to feed him. McCall represented him on the new charge of breaking the window, and Boyd was referred again to the state mental health hospital. The confrontation with police that resulted in Boyd's death began with a call to police from Northeast Heights resident Alexander Thickstun. Thickstun had first noticed Boyd on February 27, 2014, when he heard Boyd yelling \\"irrational things\\" in the darkness at 1 am, and threatening to kill another man in the area. Thickstun called police once in February, and again on March 16, after he had discovered Boyd's illegal campsite - about 100 yards from his home - while on a hike. During Sandy and Perez's murder trial, Thickstun testified that he called police because he was concerned for his own safety and that of his wife. He described Boyd's behavior as \\"scary\\" and said that his wife was \\"terrified.\\" Standoff Officers responded to the base of U Mound, the foothill area where Boyd was camped in violation of park rules; these require a permit for camping in City of Albuquerque Open Space areas. Boyd's campsite was 300 yards from the Sandia Mountain Wilderness in the Cibola National Forest. He was within the Albuquerque city limits, in the Foothills Open Space area, and approximately a hundred yards from Thickstun's home. Two Open Space officers, the first to respond, arrived with guns drawn but not pointed at Boyd. When they tried to search him, Boyd produced a knife with a partially- serrated blade about 3 1/2\\" (8.9 cm) long. As the confrontation wore on, Boyd produced another knife and threatened the officers with both of them. A witness, Alexander Thickstun, testified that Boyd threatened to kill the officers if they approached him. One officer, John McDaniel, testified at the preliminary hearing that Boyd did not attack him but threatened him, saying he was going to kill McDaniel and his partner, and refused to show the officers his hands. When the officers tried to pat him down, Boyd displayed two knives and threatened them with the knives, so they did not complete the search, he said. Additional officers responded. Crisis Intervention officer Brock Knipprath, who was at the scene, testified at the preliminary hearing that Boyd would not negotiate and talked nonsense. He testified that this behavior is considered a cue that a person might be mentally ill. Sandy's intent before shooting At his trial, Sandy testified for four hours about his actions in the standoff and a comment he made before the shooting to another officer about how he was going to shoot Boyd, whom Sandy referred to as a \\"lunatic.\\" Two hours before the shooting, officer Keith Sandy encountered New Mexico State Police Sergeant Chris Ware on Piedra Vista, the street closest to Boyd's campsite. Sandy knew Ware from his prior employment with the State Police, and greeted him. Ware's dash cam and belt recorder continued to record as they spoke. Sandy told Ware that Boyd was \\"a fucking lunatic\\" and threatened to shoot him during a conversation about Taser shotguns. Sandy had responded to the standoff because a police sergeant had requested a Taser shotgun, and he was carrying one. Some initially thought his remark was evidence of intent to shoot Boyd, but Ware said that Sandy was referring to using a Taser shotgun when they were talking. Shooting At least 19 police officers eventually responded to the scene, from the SWAT, crisis intervention and field services APD teams, as well as the New Mexico State Police, at Boyd's request. The wrongful death lawsuit filed by Boyd's brother against the City of Albuquerque lists 41 individual officers as defendants in addition to the city itself. Special prosecutor Randi Mcginn presented a slide during her opening statement in the trial that showed 19 officers present, \\"encircling\\" Boyd. The standoff between Boyd and police forces lasted about four hours, with Boyd making a variety of claims including that he was on a mission for US Special Forces, and could kill all of the officers present with one phone call. Perez was one of the last to arrive at the scene; he was dispatched at 7:01 p.m. and had been in the South Valley suburb of Los Lunas. Dispatch messages about the call while he was on his way to the scene described Boyd as making threats, with a history of running away from officers and injuring them. He threatened to kill police officers who came near him. At one point crisis intervention officer Mikal Monette was able to talk Boyd into surrendering, but as he was gathering his belongings he was told he could not bring his knives. Boyd stated, \\"I have every right to bring my knives,\\" and called that deal off. The sun had set by 7:15, and Boyd was still not giving into police demands. At 7:24 p.m., police officers Keith Sandy and Dominique Perez, K-9 officer Scott Weimerskirch, and a police dog approached Boyd's location. Boyd saw them coming, and gathered some of his belongings as if preparing to voluntarily depart. There appeared to be a chance he'd cooperate, according to video released by APD. He said \\"All right, don't change up the agreement. I'm going to try to walk with you.\\" Boyd picked up his knapsack and slung it over his shoulder, then picked up a blue nylon bag full of other belongings. > Boyd's hands were empty. He put on his backpack, reached down to pick up a > thermos, put it in his right hand and grabbed a blue... bag in his left > hand. Just as he took his first step to walk down, Sandy threw a flash-bang > grenade. Sandy said when interviewed that he had wanted to arrest Boyd before complete nightfall, to avoid the problems that darkness would bring. He threw a flash- bang grenade toward Boyd, but it bounced and, according to Sandy, landed in a rocky area to Boyd's right. Officer Rick Ingram fired a Taser shotgun at Boyd, but this did not appear to have any effect. Ingram said later that he had already called for a beanbag shotgun because he knew the Taser would not work. Trial testimony later showed that Boyd was wearing multiple layers of clothing when he was shot, and that one of the Taser probes was returned to police by the medical examiner with Boyd's clothing. Weimerskirch released the police dog to bite Boyd but it was distracted, possibly by the flight and explosion of the flash-bang. In a deposition for the civil rights lawsuit brought by Boyd's family, Weimerskirch said he believed the dog might have been shocked by a Taser probe. As the dog ran up to him, Boyd dropped the bags he had picked up and retrieved his knives from his pockets. With one knife in each hand, he assumed a squared off stance. Officers then ordered Boyd to drop the two knives several times, but he did not comply. The police dog moved in but did not bite Boyd; The dog grabbed one of the bags and brought it to his handler who had moved towards Boyd in order to get the dog to drop the blue bag. His back-up officers followed. Boyd took a step towards the officers and stopped. The canine handler tried to redirect the dog to Boyd. This put him 8'-10' from Boyd, looking down at his dog. Officers Sandy and Perez both testified at their trial that they thought that Boyd presented an imminent deadly threat to Weimerskirch, the dog handler. Sandy and Perez fired a total of three shots each. Three of those bullets hit Boyd from behind, one in the back and one in each arm. He had been turning around to his left before they started firing and he fell to the ground, face down, still holding both of his knives, wheezing. After he fell to the ground Boyd said \\"Please don't hurt me. I can't move.\\" Police approached cautiously thinking the knives might still present a danger. The officer with a beanbag shotgun summoned by Ingram just arrived with the bean bag shotgun just after the rifle fire, and fired three bean bag rounds at Boyd. The handler released the police dog again and it attacked Boyd's lower right leg, biting and shaking his calf. Police then disarmed and handcuffed Boyd as he lay wheezing on the ground. A forensic pathologist later testified that one of the bullets had passed through Boyd's spleen, transverse colon, and lower and upper lobes of a lung. Boyd died early the next morning at the University of New Mexico Hospital. Forensic pathologist Sam Andrews, a prosecution expert witness, testified at the preliminary hearing that Boyd died from gunshot wounds and sheer loss of blood. A May 29, 2014 autopsy report, by the medical examiner at the University of New Mexico said a toxicology screen had been negative. Boyd did not have either drugs or alcohol in his system when he died. Other considerations The X12 Taser shotgun officer Rick Ingram fired at Boyd had been withdrawn from the market. Taser said this was due to \\"flagging sales.\\" The drop in sales can be attributed to concerns about reliability, said Perez attorney Luis Robles, who is also a use-of-force expert. \\"It is an over- engineered weapon that had too many problems and not enough impact,\\" he said. The city had been notified two years earlier that Taser would no longer support or service these shotguns. It was not supposed to be in use, nor were the rounds in the X12, which had expired two months earlier. ROP was the only police unit still using the Taser shotguns. The APD dispatcher had called Sandy, who was off-duty but on call, to ask him to bring a Taser shotgun to the standoff in the foothills. Sandy, despite having been quickly informed that the onsite supervisor intended to call out the Gang unit not ROP, drove to the scene anyway, telling the dispatcher to cancel the call to gangs since he was already en route. He had with him four weapons: his handgun, a bean bag shotgun, the Taser shotgun, which he gave to Ingram, and an assault rifle, which he kept. He volunteered to provide lethal cover and went up the trail with his rifle. Both Albuquerque's inspector general and the New Mexico state auditor have investigated the relationship between Taser and then-police-chief Ray Schultz. According to the prosecutor at the preliminary hearing, Sandy and Perez weren't separated following the incident and weren't interviewed until two days later. Legal proceedings The Albuquerque Police Department maintains that the shooting was justified. Police Chief Gordon Eden said at a press conference following the shooting that he believed it was justified: \\"Yes, if you follow case law, Garner vs Tennessee there was directed threat to an officer.\\" After Mayor Richard Berry said that Eden was mistaken, Chief Eden said that his comments that the shooting was justified, were premature. The FBI announced on March 28, 2014 that it would investigate the death. The Bernalillo County District Attorney's Office also investigated Boyd's death. Of the 36 lapel camera videos released after the shooting, one belonged to an officer who shot him. The lawyer who represented Boyd's brother in his wrongful death suit against the city described the scene as chaotic and poorly managed, with officers confronting Boyd, rather than seeking to de-escalate the situation. They contradicted his claim that he worked for the Department of Defense and argued with him about whether he was being unreasonable. =Criminal charges= On January 12, 2015, the Bernalillo County District Attorney Kari Brandenburg charged Keith Sandy and Dominique Perez with an open count of murder. This charge allows them to be convicted of either first or second-degree murder, which carry sentences of 30 years to life and 19 years minimum respectively, or voluntary manslaughter, which carries a maximum sentence of seven years.Officers face murder charges in 2014 Albuquerque shooting, CNN, January 12, 2015 During the preliminary hearing Judge Neil Candelaria dismissed the first degree murder charges against the officers, stating that the necessary premeditation did not exist. Sandy and Perez still faced charges of second degree murder and voluntary manslaughter. But on September 28, after the prosecution had completed its case, Judge Alicia Hadfield dismissed the manslaughter charges, leaving only the more serious 2nd degree murder charges remaining,Prosecution rests case, judge drops involuntary manslaughter charges, KOB, Kai Porter and Chris Ramirez plus the Associated Press, September 28, 2016. Retrieved September 29, 2016. stating that the prosecution had not shown that the officers had been provoked by anger or the heat of passion, necessary factors to support such a charge. By the time the jury started deliberations, the officers faced second degree murder charges and Sandy faced an additional, lesser charge, of aggravated battery.[66][67] The prosecution and defense testimony concluded on October 5, 2016, with closing arguments and jury instructions scheduled for the next day.[68] On October 11, 2016, Judge Alicia Hadfield declared a mistrial in the case. The jury deadlocked with three voting guilty and nine voting not guilty. The state district court jury deliberated for two days after hearing 12 days of testimony. The special prosecutor, Randi McGinn said that she was not surprised by the verdict, adding that police use of force has become a polarizing issue. McGinn said that it would be up to the incoming District Attorney, Raul Torrez, who is running unopposed, to decide whether to retry Sandy and Perez. However, under local rules, the prosecution has 30 days from the date of the mistrial to notify the court whether to schedule a new trial. This period will run out before Torrez takes office. It is unclear if the special prosecutor McGinn or the current DA, whose office was removed from the case, will be the one to make the decision as to a new trial. Sandy's attorney, Sam Bregman, said that the jury sent \\"a pretty positive message ... that the case is pretty weak.\\" He called the prosecution \\"misguided\\" and added that he hopes the DA's office will look at the \\"weak jury support\\" and will \\"let these two good men get on with their lives. According to DA Brandenburg the trial of the officers cost the taxpayers more than $82,850. That includes expert witness fees, travel expenses and transcripts. The Special Prosecutor, Randi McGinn was paid $5,400. The state's use of force expert, Jeff Noble, was paid $7,600 and he was reimbursed for his travel expenses. These figures do not include the costs of what the court paid to hold the trial. =Special Prosecutor= On January 12, 2015, Bernalillo County District Attorney Kari Brandenburg announced that she would file murder charges against Sandy and Perez. Attorneys for Perez filed a motion with the court to have her removed. As a result, Judge Alisa Hadfield disqualified the entire Second Judicial District Attorney's Office, stating, \\"Disqualification of DA Brandenburg is necessary to ensure the appearance of fairness of trial and to ensure, public trust or confidence in the criminal justice system.\\" The APD had alleged she tried to bribe and intimidate witnesses in a burglary case against her son. Brandenburg said she spoke to the witnesses as a private individual and did not offer them money, because that would be illegal, but the witnesses said that Brandenburg offered to reimburse them for their losses if they did not tell police or pursue charges against her son. The New Mexico Attorney General, Hector Balderas, said that there was no evidence to prosecute Brandenburg. Brandenburg's son had a string of DUI and theft charges at the time. In January 2016 the son was sentenced to three years in jail in connection with the burglary and larceny charges. He had previously agreed to serve a year in a shoplifting case. Brandenburg heatedly denied wrongdoing either with respect to her son's legal problems or to the shooting charges. State Attorney-General Hector Balderas agreed after he investigated that there was no evidence of wrongdoing, although he did say that she should have asked for a special prosecutor to avoid the appearance of impropriety. He also said that some police actions in the case appeared to stem from \\"political considerations\\". =Appointment of a special prosecutor= On April 16, Brandenburg named private attorney Randi McGinn special prosecutor for the case, saying that the Attorney-General's office and thirteen other DA offices around the state had all declined to take the case for reasons of either budget or case load. McGinn, a civil-rights trial attorney who recently represented a plaintiff in a wrongful death suit against the city, was paid $5,400 what a public defender would receive for a death penalty case. McGinn filed charges of second degree murder and voluntary and involuntary manslaughter against the two officers.http://www.koat.com/news/watch-live-da- to-discuss-james-boyd-murder-case/32399476A At the preliminary hearing, District Court Judge Neil Candelaria dismissed the involuntary manslaughter charges, saying they were not appropriate in this case, which seemed \\"more of intentional and I haven't heard much of anything unintentional.\\" This was the least serious of the charges, and the officers still faced trial on the voluntary manslaughter, second-degree murder, and assault charges that remained. On June 22, 2015, court document filings showed McGinn seeking charges of second degree murder against Sandy and Perez. The filing also includes accusations of voluntary manslaughter, involuntary manslaughter, and aggravated assault.

The lawsuit asked that the city and the police department put in place given corrective measures including better training for law enforcement officers in how to deal with individuals suffering from mental illness, requiring all officers be trained in crisis intervention, that anyone \\"subjected to force\\" during any encounter with the Albuquerque Police Department be given prompt medical attention, and that the city establish a fund called the \\"James Matthew Boyd Emergency Outreach Team\\" which would provide resources for local doctors and others to help people who are homeless and experiencing a mental health crisis. The lawsuit was settled in July 2015 for $5 million. = Department of Justice Investigation = The U.S. Department of Justice released a scathing report on April 10, 2014, saying Albuquerque's Police Department \\"engages in a pattern or practice of using excessive force during the course of arrests and other detentions in violation of the Fourth Amendment ... Albuquerque police officers often use deadly force in circumstances where there is no imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm to officers or others.\\" It cited an incident in which officers Tasered a man who had poured gasoline on himself, accidentally setting him on fire. The report did not investigate the Boyd shooting, which happened shortly before its release, but said Chief Eden's comments about it as an example of systemic problems in the APD. \\"The recent remarks by the police chief in response to the James Boyd shooting on March 16, 2014, demonstrate that more work is needed to change the culture of APD,\\" it said. \\"Supervisors marked as 'reasonable' almost every use of force report form we saw,\\" said the report, and officers were almost never reprimanded for failing to turn on their cameras. The report also cited a pattern of violence against people who were mentally ill or unable to comply due to their mental state. One developmentally disabled man was tasered, kicked and beaten, yet his attacker was never charged with any crime. City officials signed a 106-page consent decree with the Department of Justice in response to the report, but the shootings have continued. \\"Police shootings have dropped since the DOJ Report was released and the APD instituted changes in policy and training to conform to the consent decree.\\" As a result of the consent decree APD officers now receive training on how to minimize the use of force in high stress situations. The court monitor said, \\"The SWAT unit has become one of the strongest teams within the department.\\" Officers have used their guns less since receiving this training. In 2013 eight shootings resulting in death or injuries. In 2015 that number dropped to five. Officers used their guns 15 times in 2013 and 10 times in 2015. Officers Keith Sandy had faced criminal fraud charges in 2007, as one of four police officers who were receiving payments for teaching classes from Wackenhut, a private security contractor, while simultaneously working for the New Mexico State Police and being paid to attend a class. One resigned and Sandy and two others were fired. That case against Officer Sandy was later dropped, since no charges had been filed against him. Then-Deputy Chief Mike Castro said when he hired him afterwards as a civilian investigator, that Sandy would not be badged or allowed to carry a gun. Those restrictions were lifted later. Sandy also launched a case against the chief criminal judge in the county, causing the latter's resignation. However the District Attorney of the First Judicial District characterized it as a \\"terrible\\" case, and \\"a mess,\\" and that as a result, it could not be prosecuted. Officer Sandy joined the Repeat Offender Unit, considered an elite assignment. Sandy's father was also an Albuquerque police officer, who was shot on-duty. No video of the Boyd shooting was recovered from Sandy's camera; it either malfunctioned or was never turned on. Sandy was allowed to retire from the Albuquerque Police Department in November 2014. However, the APD internal affairs investigation continued. K-9 officer Scott Weimerkirch was found in the 2012 federal Nelson v City of Albuquerque District Court case to have used his police dog in an unconstitutional use of police force, yet, according to the Boyd wrongful death suit, he had received no disciplinary sanction, counseling, or corrective training as a result. The case was similar to Boyd's, in that the dog tore flesh from Boyd's leg in much the same manner as he had torn flesh from the arm of an unthreatening suspect in Nelson. Weimerkirch and the dog have both since retired. Albuquerque police told the media, \\"Perez must also complete all of the department's new training related to our settlement agreement, along with state required training, and pass a psychological exam.\\" APD officer Mikal Monette had crisis intervention training and had successfully resolved hundreds of situations. He testified at trial that an APD sergeant removed him from the bargaining process, replacing him with Detective Sandy and others shortly before Boyd was mortally wounded. This was even though Monette had made some progress and had succeeded in getting Boyd, at one point, to agree to leave with him. But when Boyd learned that he could not bring his knives, he stated, \\"I have every right to bring my knives,\\" and called that deal off. When questioned by the defense, Monette admitted that Boyd would need to actually cooperate with the commands that Monette was giving him, before the situation could be deescalated. Protests A protest was held on March 25, 2014, in response to the shooting of James Boyd. Thousands of people marched through downtown Albuquerque and the Nob Hill area of the city. On the three-month anniversary of Boyd's death, a group of people held a vigil at his campsite in his honor, singing Amazing Grace and vowing to improve the lives of the homeless and the mentally ill in Albuquerque. History of APD Police Shootings The Albuquerque City Council unsuccessfully tried September 7, 2011 to override an August 19 veto by Mayor Richard Berry of the council's bill requesting a Department of Justice investigation into police violence. Because of a long string of police shootings before Boyd's, the United States Department of Justice had already initiated an investigation into APD police violence. A key finding of its April 2014 report was that \\"the Albuquerque Police Department engages in a pattern or practice of unreasonable use of deadly force in officers' use of firearms.\\" Prior to the charges against Perez and Sandy, no APD officer had faced prosecution in a death resulting from police violence since 1977. On March 25, 2014, the same day as a protest over the shooting of Boyd, APD police officers shot and killed Alfred Redwine, saying that he had discharged a firearm. Witnesses said he only had pointed the gun at his own head. Other witnesses said the \\"gun\\" was actually a cellphone. His sister, Tammy Redwine said \\"Then he was dropping his other hand to drop the gun that he had to his head, and when he dropped everything to his sides, that's when they opened fire and shot him.\\" She told police officers she was on the phone with her brother and he wanted to come out. A neighbor said he heard a man shout \\"Just do it!\\" the moment before shots were fired. A KOAT 7 reporter, Mike Springer, narrates a video tape showing the scene as he says, \\"In this video that was taken by a viewer, you can see Redwine lower his arm. You hear a gunshot and see smoke rise from the ground.\\" It appears as if Redwine fired his gun into the ground. Redwine's death sparked another protest on the 30th, from noon into the night. Police did clash with demonstrators at this demonstration, eventually using tear gas after, they said, some protesters threw rocks. As the FBI launched an investigation into Boyd's death, \\"graffiti splashed across downtown Albuquerque, declaring, \\"We are James Boyd,\\" said the Santa Fe New Mexican. On April 21, 2014, APD officer Jeremy Dear killed 19-year-old Mary Hawkes by shooting her three times as she ran away from him. Hawkes was suspected of having been in a stolen car. Dear said she pointed a handgun at him, but his lapel cam either did not record the encounter or was not turned on. Hawkes had methamphetamine in her system when she died. Dear had a history of excessive force complaints and repeated failure to record arrests with his lapel camera. He was fired for insubordination. He successfully appealed his firing; the appeals board voted 3-2 to overturn his termination. City records show that between 2009 and 2014, Albuquerque Police Department officers were involved in 47 shootings. Deaths resulted from 32 of these shootings. The Department of Justice reviewed 20 shootings from 2009-2010 and in its final report said that a majority of them had violated the suspect's constitutional rights. Police Chief Gorden Eden attributed the situation to \\"systemic failure in our ability to track employee misconduct,\\" and said that he believed \\"there are people on the force who shouldn't be on the force.\\" However, he said, because union rules make it difficult to discipline officers retroactively, \\"we may be stuck with them.\\" =History of wrongful death litigation= Civil lawsuits have cost the city at least $23 million. This figure includes $7.95 million paid to the family of Kenneth Ellis, who was shot as he held a gun to his own head, and $900,000 to the family of Alan Gomez, an unarmed man shot with a spoon in his hand by Sean Wallace, who had previously shot two other men in the line of duty. The city was ordered to pay $6 million in another shooting from April 12, 2011, after a judge said the police officers' story was not credible. The detective in that case jumped over a garden wall and shot a mentally ill man named Christopher Torres in his parents' backyard. The police said that Torres, who was shot in the back, tried to take a gun from the waistband of one of the officers. However, a neighbor called police to report that two men were attacking Torres. The officers wore plainclothes attire and the neighbor thought he was being robbed.

Geography  A majority of Dundas is protected within the D'Aguilar National Park. Several peaks of the D'Aguilar Range are in Dundas, including Mount Sim Jue, The Bulls Knob, Northbrook and Tenison Woods Mountain, the highest peak on the range. The Northbrook Parkway is the only crossing over the D'Aguilar Range, connecting the south of the Somerset Region with the Moreton Bay Region. Dundas borders the Wivenhoe Dam and the public boating facilities of Billy's Bay. The area is best accessed via Wivenhoe-Somerset Road on approach from Fernvale. Public access to this area by public transport is limited to a local school bus service. The natural park like attributes of this area make it ideal for wildlife. It is not uncommon to hear songbirds and to see bush turkeys in the natural forest, and eagles flying overhead at the peaks of the local mountains. Deer which was the emblem of the Shire of Esk can be spotted in the area on rare occasion. Lake Wivenhoe allows Dundas residents to see the sunset over water (not normally possible in South-East Queensland). There are some public parks and recreational facilities in the Dundas area in addition to Billy's Bay. They include the Lake Wivenhoe Branch Creek Day Use Area, maintained by SEQ Water, located on Wivenhoe-Somerset Road near Kipper Creek Road and two parks: Red Cedar and White Cedar, both located on the Western approach of the Northbrook Parkway. East of the last-mentioned two parks, is the Northbrook Gorge (fresh water swimming, accessible from an unsigned car park, moderate difficulty walking access down steep slope) and the Wivenhoe Lookout 5 minutes drive further up the mountain with marked car park and wood BBQ facilities and toilet. History The first holder of the Fairney View pastoral run was Joseph North, whose wife was christened Robert Dundas Burnett after a friend of her father (Judge John Burnett). Burnett's intention had been to name a son after his friend but he had a daughter instead. North used the Dundas name for part of his property holdings and it gave the name to the district. The Dundas police station was established on 15 December 1893, but was renamed Sandy Creek in February 1894. In March 1896 it was relocated to Deep Creek. The Anglican Church at Dundas opened in 1955. It closed on 20 February 1977 for the construction of the Wivenhoe Dam. Dundas was significantly impacted by the introduction of the Wivenhoe Dam. The construction of the Wivenhoe Dam resulted in several farms and the original road infrastructure for the area being permanently flooded. The land adjacent to the Dam was converted into State leasehold land with restrictions being imposed on land usage. The locale of Framptons Road, Dundas has been used for commercial activity in the past. A small-scale saw mill was operated by a local farmer of the area from the 1950s to the 1960s. During the 1990s there was a horse riding school in operation at Framptons Road. In the 2011 census, Dundas was counted within the larger area of Crossdale which had a population of 190 people.

APD was called around 9pm to the location, a public housing complex at 60th and Central, after Redwine allegedly pointed a gun at two girls then went back into his apartment next door. APD officers shot and killed Alfred Redwine, saying that he had discharged a firearm, hours after a protest over the shooting of James Boyd. The new shooting led to more protests. Shooting Redwine left the apartment with an object held to his head, possibly a cell phone or a firearm. It is unclear if the first shot fired was by Redwine or an APD officer, however, APD said that Redwine fired, at which point they returned fire. APD says a revolver was found at the scene.

Additionally, a video, reportedly released by \\"Anonymous\\", called for its members to aim \\"their canons\\" at the Albuquerque Police Department's website, and called for Albuquerque citizens to rise up and protest at APD headquarters on March 30, 2014. Hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets of Albuquerque, marching past police officers in riot gear to protest the spate of police-involved shootings. The Albuquerque Police Department reported their website had been down throughout the day due to a denial-of-service attack. Mayor Richard Berry reported that the peaceful protest had turned to mayhem, responding to the arrest of an unknown number of citizens.

It was taken by the Kamehamehas as a Hawaiian royal standard and used by the Royal Families to indicate their lineage. History The kƒÅhili has long been a symbol of the Hawaiian ali ªi chiefs and the noble houses of the Hawaiian Islands. A kƒÅhili bearer (paa- kahili ) is one who carries or bears the standard for the royal subject. The kƒÅhili signified power from the divinities. The Ali'i surrounded themselves with the standard. It was made using the long bones of an enemy king and decorated with the feathers from birds of prey. The Royal Coat of Arms of the Kingdom of Hawaii depicts the twin Kame ªeiamoku holding a feather standard. Among the pieces collected on Captain Cook voyages were numerous feathered artifacts including 7 kƒÅhili of the normal design before European influence. In 1825 while aboard the visiting ship returning the remains of Kamehameha II from England, Robert Dampier painted a portrait of Princess NƒÅhi ªena ªena holding the royal feather standard. The Bishop Museum, which was founded in 1889 has an extensive collection of feathered standards on display along with portraits of the monarchs of the 19th century. Their collection is displayed in the \\"KƒÅhili Room\\". KƒÅhili bearer KƒÅhili bearers for Her Highness Ke ªelik≈çlani Only the ali'i had the right to possess kƒÅhili; It was considered a staff of state. A paa-kahili (kƒÅhili bearer) followed the king everywhere he went. The standard could be used as a fly-brush and waved over the sleeping noble. A ha'aku'e was a kƒÅhili bearer of the same sex as the person they served. The role was similar to that of a squire or page. =Funeral rites= The hana lawelawe of the paa-kahili is an important ritual duty at the funeral of a Hawaiia noble's funeral. From the time the body is laid out to the moment it is interred, the bearers wave the kƒÅhili above the deceased. Three of four kƒÅhili bearers stand on either side and at regular intervals raise the standards above the body until they meet the opposing feathered staff on the other side. The standards are then waved to the right, left and then up while genealogy chants are sung detailing the deeds of the figure and their ancestors. When the body is transported from the home to the church, the hearse is surrounded by kƒÅhili bearers. Once at the chapel the ritual continues, as well as while transferring the deceased to the cemetery. At Bernice Pauahi Bishop's funeral, 150 black kƒÅhili were carried and displayed. Crafting Feather crafting is something that was brought to the islands from the first Polynesian voyagers, however, Hawaii has the most advanced examples. The feathers of small birds that were held in high regard for their religious significance were used in crafting a number of the regalia of the Hawaiian chiefs. The  ªahu  ªula, mahiole, kahili and other objects of the ali ªi were made with these sacred feathers. A skilled craftsman would be used to create these specific items. The craft was a strong hereditary bond and was passed to younger generations from older experts. The po ªe hahai manu were the expert feather gatherers and would spend months in collection hunts in the forest. Collecting the feathers would sometimes be done for generations.

Schechter (born December 16, 1951) is a Canadian epidemiologist recognized for contributions to HIV research, prevention and treatments and to addiction research. He is a professor and the former founding director of the School of Population and Public Health in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of British Columbia (UBC). Schechter received his Order of British Columbia in 1994 alongside BC's first Nobel Prize laureate Michael Smith. He now serves as Chief Scientific Officer of the Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research. Education Schechter completed his BA in Mathematics at York University (1973), his MA in Mathematics at UBC (1975), his PhD in Mathematics at the Polytechnic Institute of New York (1977), his MD in Medicine at McMaster University (1981) and his MSc in Epidemiology at the University of Toronto (1983). Contributions to health research Schechter combines interests in clinical epidemiology and health services research with HIV/AIDS and urban health research including opioid addiction research. He is the author of more than 350 peer-reviewed publications and 530 abstracts and scholarly presentations. When Schechter first began his work on AIDS research in 1983, there were no reported cases yet in British Columbia and embracing the necessity of an appropriate and humane response to HIV infection was not a popular activity at that time. Airing public service announcements about condoms in movie theatres caused a public and private debate between Schechter and then-Premier of British Columbia Bill Vander Zalm. Had HIV not been such an emerging health crisis, Schechter likely would have continued in the field of breast cancer. In 1989, he helped organize the Fifth International Conference on AIDS in Montreal as a member of its steering committee. In 1990, he was invited by the World Health Organization to participate on its 10-member Steering Committee on Epidemiology, Forecasting and Surveillance that was monitoring the scale of the AIDS epidemic and advising on prevention programs in the early period of the epidemic. Schechter co-founded the Canadian HIV Trials Network in 1990 with John Ruedy and Julio Montaner. Under Schechter's leadership as National Director from 1992 to 2014, the Network grew to become a nationwide collaboration of researchers, people living with HIV/AIDS and facilities to investigate treatments, preventions and vaccines for HIV/AIDS. In 1992, he co-founded the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS and was its Director of Epidemiology and Public Health from 1992 - 2006. Schechter also co-founded the Canadian Association for HIV Research and served as its inaugural President in 1991. In 1996, Schechter co- chaired the XI International AIDS Conference in Vancouver which attracted 15,000 delegates from around the world. It was at this global conference that the benefits of triple-therapy HAART were first fully revealed. In 2004, he co-founded the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences, serving as its first President-Elect from 2004 to 2007 and second President from 2007 to 2009. Heroin trials Schechter was the principal investigator and co-authored a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine about the controversial North American Opiate Medication Initiative (NAOMI). The 2005-2008 randomized controlled trial compared the use of diacetylmorphine (heroin) and methadone in people with severe opioid dependence. In the NAOMI study, researchers selected 250 subjects in Vancouver and Montreal with at least five years of heroin addiction and who had twice previously not benefited from addiction treatment including methadone maintenance. Providing injections of medically prescribed heroin in a clinic setting was projected to save about $40,000 per person in lifetime societal costs compared to methadone. The study found those receiving the effective element of heroin were 62 per cent more likely to remain in addiction treatment and 40 per cent less likely to take street drugs and commit crimes to support their habit than those given methadone. Schechter was also involved as a lead investigator in the follow-up to NAOMI, the Study to Assess Longer-term Opioid Medication Effectiveness (SALOME) funded by Canadian Institutes of Health Research. The SALOME trial established that the licensed analgesic drug, hydromorphone, was as effective as heroin in the treatment of severe opioid dependence, opening another avenue for treatment with injectable medications.

In 2018, the Canadian government amended regulations to make medically prescribed heroin more accessible. Specifically, the new rules allow for administering diacetylmorphine outside of a hospital setting, and let nurse practitioners administer the drug. In 2019, Canada became the first country in the world to approve the use of hydromorphone for severe opioid use disorder based on the results of the SALOME trial.

Early collecting In \\"Old-time Memories\\" in Stanley Gibbons Monthly Journal of 1906, Hanciau tells how he started to collect stamps in 1852, aged seventeen, after seeing the collection of Pierre Maus who had not more than fifty different stamps. Hanciau had a great deal of difficulty finding stamps to add to his collection. Many people thought him \\"cracked\\" and many letters bore no stamps. He often negotiated with postmen to buy stamps they had torn from letters and so many customers complained about the damage that the practice eventually became an offence punishable by dismissal. There were no stamp dealers at first, and the earliest dealers like Jean-Baptiste Moens traded in stamps only as a sideline. On the other hand, few people knew anything about stamps and Hanciau was often able to obtain great rarities at very little cost.\\"Old-time Memories\\" by L.

Italian film historian and critic Roberto Curti commented that \\"the lives of Verdi, Rossini, and Bellini offered not only entertainment, but also a reminder of the country's past glory as a popular antidote to the misery and squalor unearthed by Neorealism.\\" Director Riccardo Freda was set-up with the subject of Ant√¥nio Carlos Gomes, a Brazilian composer who was popular in Italy. His best known work was the opera Il Guarany, based on the novel by Jose de Alencar. The film was a production by Universalia Film, a Catholic- oriented production company started in 1946. According to Piero Regnoli, who was the company's vice artistic manager at the time, Universalia had \\"about one billion lire at disposal-cash. It was the biggest production company [in Italy].\\" Freda was friends with Salvo D'Angelo who was high up in the Universalia Film company, and stated he asked for a large sum of money to develop the film as he was uninterested in developing it, but was surprised when it was granted. Filming began on June 11, 1948 in Rome and after one week, the crew moved to Brazil to shoot on location there. Release and reception Guarany was submitted to the Italian board of censors in November 1949. 'Guarany was distributed theatrically in Italy by Universalia Film on 3 January 1950. The film grossed a total of 8,750,000 Italian lire domestically, which Curti described as being \\"virtually ignored by the public\\".

Torfi's life is reported in a number of folktales as well as contemporary records, and fact in his life is sometimes hard to distinguish from legend. Life Torfi's parents were Ingibj√∂rg Eir√≠ksd√≥ttir and her husband J√≥n √ìlafsson, a farmer and s√Ωsluma√∞ur in Klofi, son of √ìlafur Loftsson (d. c. 1458), the son of Loftur r√≠ki Guttormsson. J√≥n died sometime after 1471 and in 1481 Ingibj√∂rg married Ormur J√≥nsson √≠ Klofa, a farmer and later s√Ωsluma√∞ur of Skar√∞ √° Skar√∞sstr√∂nd, who was within four degrees of relation to Ingibj√∂rg and so had to receive papal dispensation to marry her. Ormur and Ingibj√∂rg got into disputes with Bishop Stef√°n J√≥nsson, partly because they were sheltering criminals whom the Bishop wanted to take into his power. Torfi, who lived in Hvammur √≠ D√∂lum and Hj√∂rsey in M√Ωrar before he moved to Klofi, also had disputes with the bishop, both because Torfi protected people from prosecution by the bishop and also the bishop did not think he paid all of his tithes and other taxes to the Church. Torfi seems to have been a major troublemaker, who would stop at nothing. It is, however, said that relations between Torfi and the bishop settled down after Torfi was struck with illness at the Al√æingi, giving a great cry and becoming so strong that it took eight men to hold him and tied him up. The bishop had the priests calm him with readings and singing until Torfi slept and thereafter was less troublesome. In 1502 Torfi had L√©nhar√∞ur f√≥geti killed. Little is known about L√©nhar√∞ur, a foreign thief based at Arnarb√¶li. Torfi pursued him with a posse and had him killed at Hraun √≠ √ñlfusi. Torfi confessed this to Bishop Stef√°n but the bishop did not impose a major penance, considering the killing a public service. At the Al√æingi in 1504, Torfi was again being aggressive, wanting to drive the s√Ωsluma√∞ur Arn√≥r Finnsson from office, influencing the judgement with a band of armed men. Not long afterwards, Torfi died. There are two accounts of his death: he is generally said to have died from sickness at Sk√≠√∞bakki in Landeyjar, or from drinking at F√≠flholts√æing. After his death, his widow made peace with Bishop Stef√°n, handing over three farms and a silver cross for Torfi to be buried at Sk√°lholt, as he had wished. Torfi's wife was Helga Gu√∞nad√≥ttir (d. 1544), daughter of the s√Ωsluma√∞ur Gu√∞ni J√≥nsson of Kirkjub√≥l, the brother of Torfi's stepfather Ormur J√≥nsson, and his wife √û√≥ra, the daughter of Bj√∂rn √ûorleifsson hir√∞stj√≥ri of Skar√∞. Helga and Torfi had many children, most of whom were still children when their father died. Helga lived as a widow at Klofi until 1525. Appearances in popular culture Torfi allegedly gives his name to Torfaj√∂kull where, according to legend, he found a hidden valley where took his people in 1493 to escape the plague. Some of Torfi's exploits are recounted and utilised in Krist√≠n Helga Gunnarsd√≥ttir's children's novel R√≠√≥l√≠treglan (Reykjav√≠k: M√°l og Menning, 2011).

The hosts personally investigate claims about spirituality, fringe science, religion, and the paranormal, then discuss their findings on the show. The motto of the podcast is \\"We show up so you don't have to.\\" History Blocher and Poppy in front of an alt=Man with light skin and dark hair and woman with dark hair and light skin stand in front of a building with a sign that reads \\"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; Visitors Welcome\\" The hosts, Ross Blocher and Carrie Poppy, met at a book club meeting at the Center for Inquiry (CFI) West, where they discovered they had a mutual love for The Simpsons television program. They were also both interested in religion and fringe science, so they decided to attend a meeting of the Kabbalah Centre in LA together and analyze the claims made there. That experience inspired them to start their own podcast centered around such investigations. The first episode, based on their experiences at the Kabbalah Centre, was released on March 10, 2011. The show was independently distributed until it became part of the Maximum Fun network in January 2014. Funding for the hosts' investigations comes from listener donations. Blocher and Poppy have since investigated a number of religious groups, fringe science claims, and alternative medicine modalities, including Mormonism, dowsing, and Reiki healing. The podcast has been ranked among the top 100 podcasts on iTunes in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The highest ranking it has achieved in each country is #30 in Australia, #28 in Canada, #93 in the UK, and #36 in the U.S. It has also been one of the most downloaded podcasts on iTunes in the Religion and Spirituality category, ranking as high as #11 on February 9, 2014. Format Most episodes feature Blocher and Poppy talking about their experiences during a recent investigation they performed, while some episodes are based on interviews with guests who have some relation to a recent investigation. The investigations usually take place in the Los Angeles area, although some have occurred in other areas of California and Arizona, or even internationally. When investigating a claim, the hosts generally attend meetings or sessions having conducted little background research in order to get a feel for what the average person would experience. They perform the investigations undercover and only reveal that they are journalists if asked. On one occasion, when investigating the Ordo Templi Orientis, they used assumed names to protect their identities. Some investigations are continued over the span of more than one episode. The hosts have even gone so far as to be baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Ra√´lian UFO religion to more fully explore the teachings of these religions. Poppy was also certified as a Reiki healer in the course of an investigation. At the end of each investigation, the hosts subjectively rate the level of pseudoscience, creepiness, danger, and cost (or \\"pocket drainer\\" value) of the claim or group they studied using ten-point scales. The pseudoscience rating is based on a scale in which the theory of evolution has a score of 1 (completely scientific) and the idea that humans are made completely of goat sperm has a score of 10 (completely pseudoscientific). Poppy also frequently gives a \\"hot drink\\" rating, at the end of the investigation. The show is produced by Ian Kremer, and the theme music was created by Brian Keith Dalton, producer of the Mr. Deity video series. Blocher and Poppy intermittently perform a live version of the show. In an interview with Richard Saunders Blocher said that the live show gives them a great opportunity to \\"meet people in person and know that our message... of having fun with zany beliefs resonates with people\\"  Scientology investigation  Beginning in February, 2016, they began releasing episodes about an investigation of the Church of Scientology. In their first Scientology episode, the pair state that an investigation of Scientology was their most frequent request. The Scientology episodes were recommended by The Guardian, The A.V. Club, Boing Boing, and SplitSider. , there are ten episodes devoted to the Scientology investigation ‚Äì 9 original episodes in 2016, and a follow-up episode in 2017. Former senior Scientology executive Mike Rinder said of one episode that \\"the insight into the current state of affairs inside LA Org is revelatory\\" because Blocher was the only person in attendance at the introductory classes, despite Scientology's claims that their Los Angeles site is an ideal example of Scientology's success. Guests In addition to episodes about investigations, Blocher and Poppy have also released episodes based on interviews with guests who have some relation to or expertise in the subject of a recent investigation. Notable guests include: * Brian Keith Dalton, producer of Mr. Deity * Mark Edward, mentalist and psychic entertainer * Emery Emery, comedian and podcast host * Susan Gerbic, skeptical activist * Roger Nygard, film director * Don Prothero, paleontologist * Mike Rinder, former Scientologist * Jon Ronson, author * Eugenie Scott, anthropologist and advocate for evolution education * Louis Theroux, documentary filmmaker who made My Scientology Movie Hosts Blocher and Poppy investigate the alt=Man with light skin and dark hair and woman with light hair and light skin stand in front of a white building with a domed roof Ross Blocher lives in the Los Angeles area.

Blocher also investigates fringe science and spirituality with the Independent Investigations Group. Both of Blocher's parents were teachers of mathematics. Carrie Poppy is a writer and actress living in Los Angeles. She studied theater and philosophy at the University of the Pacific, then studied improvisation and sketch comedy at The Groundlings.

S. Monin and A. M. Obukhov. Similarity theory is an empirical method which describes universal relationships between non-dimensionalized variables of fluids based on the Buckingham Pi theorem. Similarity theory is extensively used in boundary layer meteorology, since relations in turbulent processes are not always resolvable from first principles. An idealized vertical profile of the mean flow for a neutral boundary layer is the logarithmic wind profile derived from Prandtl's mixing length theory, which states that the horizontal component of mean flow is proportional to the logarithm of height. M‚ÄìO similarity theory further generalizes the mixing length theory in non-neutral conditions by using so-called \\"universal functions\\" of dimensionless height to characterize vertical distributions of mean flow and temperature. The Obukhov length (L), a characteristic length scale of surface layer turbulence derived by Obukhov in 1946, is used for non-dimensional scaling of the actual height. M‚ÄìO similarity theory marked a significant landmark of modern micrometeorology, providing a theoretical basis for micrometerological experiments and measurement techniques.  The Obukhov length  The Obukhov length L is a length parameter for the surface layer in the boundary layer, which characterizes the relative contributions to turbulent kinetic energy from buoyant production and shear production. The Obukhov length was formulated using Richardson's criterion for dynamic stability. It was derived as, L=-\\\\dfrac{u_*^3}{\\\\kappa \\\\dfrac{g}{T}\\\\dfrac{Q}{\\\\rho c_p}} where \\\\kappa\\\\approx 0.40 is the von K√°rm√°n constant, u_* friction velocity, Q turbulent heat flux, and c_p heat capacity. Virtual potential temperature \\\\theta_v is often used instead of temperature T to correct for the effects of pressure and water vapor. Q can be written as vertical eddy flux, Q=\\\\rho c_p \\\\overline{w'\\\\theta_v'} with w' and \\\\theta_v' perturbations of vertical velocity and virtual potential temperature, respectively. Therefore, the Obukhov length can also be defined as, L=-\\\\dfrac{u_*^3}{\\\\kappa \\\\dfrac{g}{\\\\overline{\\\\theta_v}}\\\\overline{w'\\\\theta_v'}} The Obukhov length also acts as a criterion for the static stability of surface layer. When L<0, the surface layer is statically unstable, and when L>0 the surface layer is statically stable. The absolute magnitude of L indicates the deviation from statically neutral state, with smaller |Lvalues corresponding to larger deviations from neutral conditions. When |Lis small and L<0, buoyant processes dominate the production of turbulent kinetic energy compared with shear production. By definition, under neutral conditions L\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty. The Obukhov length L is used for non-dimensionalization of height z in similarity theory.  Governing formulae for similarity relations  M‚ÄìO similarity theory parameterizes fluxes in the surface layer as a function of the dimensionless length parameter \\\\zeta=z/L. From the Buckingham Pi theorem of dimensional analysis, two dimensionless group can be formed from the basic parameter set \\\\\\\\{ u_*, g/\\\\overline{\\\\theta_v}, \\\\partial\\\\overline{u}/\\\\partial z, z, \\\\overline{w'\\\\theta_v'}\\\\\\\\}, \\\\dfrac{\\\\kappa z}{u_*}\\\\dfrac{\\\\partial \\\\overline{u}}{\\\\partial z} , and \\\\zeta =\\\\dfrac{z}{L} From there, a function \\\\varphi_M(\\\\zeta) can be determined to empirically describe the relationship between the two dimensionless quantities, called a universal function. Similarly, \\\\varphi_H(\\\\zeta) can be defined for the dimensionless group of mean temperature profile. Mean wind and temperature profiles therefore satisfy the following relations, \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial \\\\overline{u}}{\\\\partial z} =\\\\dfrac{u_*}{\\\\kappa z}\\\\varphi_M(\\\\zeta) \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial \\\\overline{\\\\theta_v}}{\\\\partial z} =\\\\dfrac{\\\\theta_*}{\\\\kappa z}\\\\varphi_H(\\\\zeta) where \\\\theta_*= - \\\\dfrac{\\\\overline{w'\\\\theta_v'}}{u_*} is the characteristic dynamical temperature, \\\\varphi_M and \\\\varphi_H are the universal functions of momentum and heat. The eddy diffusivity coefficients for momentum and heat fluxes are defined as follows, K_M = \\\\kappa z\\\\dfrac{ u_*}{\\\\varphi_M(\\\\zeta)},\\\\ K_H = \\\\kappa z\\\\dfrac{ u_*}{\\\\varphi_H(\\\\zeta)} K_M and K_H can be related with the turbulent Prandtl number Pr_t, \\\\dfrac{K_H}{K_M}=\\\\dfrac{1}{Pr_t}>1 In reality, the universal functions need to be determined using experimental data when applying M‚ÄìO similarity theory. Although the choice of universal functions is not unique, certain functional forms have been proposed and are widely accepted for fitting experimental data.  Universal functions of the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory  Universal functions for Monin-Obukhov similarity theory Several functional forms have been proposed to represent the universal functions of similarity theory. Because the Obukhov length is determined when L\\\\Big(\\\\dfrac{\\\\partial Ri}{\\\\partial z}\\\\Big)_{z=0}=1, where Ri is the Richardson number, the following condition must be satisfied by the universal function chosen, \\\\varphi(0)=1 A first order approximation of the universal function for momentum flux is, \\\\varphi_M(\\\\zeta)=1+\\\\beta\\\\zeta where \\\\beta\\\\approx 6. However this is only applicable when 0<\\\\zeta<1. For conditions where \\\\zeta<0, the relation is, \\\\varphi_M^4-\\\\gamma\\\\zeta\\\\varphi_M^3=1 where \\\\gamma is a coefficient to be determined from experimental data. This equation can be further approximated by \\\\varphi_M=(1+\\\\gamma\\\\zeta)^{-1/4} when -2<\\\\zeta<0. Based on the results of the 1968 Kansas experiment, the following universal functions are determined for horizontal mean flow and mean virtual potential temperature, \\\\varphi_M(\\\\zeta)=(1-15\\\\zeta)^{-1/4}\\\\quad -2<\\\\zeta <0 \\\\varphi_M(\\\\zeta)=1+4.7\\\\zeta\\\\quad 0<\\\\zeta <1 \\\\varphi_H(\\\\zeta)=0.74(1-9\\\\zeta)^{-1/2}\\\\quad -2<\\\\zeta <0 \\\\varphi_H(\\\\zeta)=0.74+4.7\\\\zeta\\\\quad 0<\\\\zeta <1 Other methods which determine the universal functions using the relation between \\\\zeta and Ri are also used. For sublayers with significant roughness, e.g. vegetated surfaces or urban areas, the universal functions must be modified to include the effects of surface roughness.  Validations  A myriad of experimental efforts were devoted to validation of the M-O similarity theory. Field observations and computer simulations have generally demonstrated that M-O similarity theory is well satisfied. = In field measurements = A Kansas wheat field The 1968 Kansas experiment found great consistency between measurements and predictions from similarity relations for the entire range of stability values. A flat wheat field in Kansas served as the experiment site, with winds measured by anemometers mounted at different heights on a 32 m tower. The temperature profile was also measured in a similar manner. Results from the Kansas field study indicated that the ratio of eddy diffusivities of heat and momentum was approximately 1.35 under neutral conditions. A similar experiment was conducted in a flat field in northwestern Minnesota in 1973. This experiment used both ground and balloon-based observations of the surface layer and further validated the theoretical predictions from similarity. = In large eddy simulations = In addition to field experiments, analysis of M‚ÄìO similarity theory can be conducted using high-resolution large eddy simulations. The simulation indicates that the temperature field agrees well with M‚ÄìO similarity. However, the velocity field shows significant anomalies from M‚ÄìO similarity.  Limitations  M‚ÄìO similarity theory, albeit successful for surface layers from experimental validations, is essentially a diagnostic empirical theory based upon local first order turbulence closure. Typically, 10%~20% errors are associated with the universal functions. When applied to vegetated areas or complex terrains, it can result in large discrepancies. Because universal functions are often determined under dry conditions, the applicability of M‚ÄìO similarity theory under moist conditions were not well studied. The basic parameter set of the M‚ÄìO similarity theory includes buoyancy production \\\\dfrac{gQ}{T}. It is argued that with such a parameter set, the scaling is applied to the integral features of the flow, whereas an eddy specific similarity relationship prefers the usage of energy dissipation rate \\\\epsilon_0. This scheme is able to explain anomalies of M‚ÄìO similarity theory, but involves non-locality to modeling and experiments.

Early life and education Ira J. Condit was born November 18, 1883, in Jersey, Ohio, and graduated from Granville High School in 1900. He went on to Ohio State University, where he received his B.S. in 1905. After more than a decade working in various horticulture-related jobs, he returned to school, earning an M.S. from the University of California (1928) and a Ph.D. from Stanford University (1932). Career After leaving college Condit spent a year in Washington, D.C., at the Division of Entomology in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Between 1907 and 1912, he was an instructor in horticulture at California Polytechnic School, San Luis Obispo. While teaching at the polytechnic, he met Caroline Callender, and they married in June 1912. In 1913, he moved to Berkeley, California, where he joined the College of Agriculture as an assistant professor in citriculture. He began to study subtropical fruit, subsequently publishing research reports on cultivation of the avocado (1915), carob (1919), oriental persimmon (1919), and loquat (1915). He kept track of avocado cultivars in the state, and these efforts, together with his avocado report, were instrumental in helping to establish the economically important California avocado industry.J.E.C. \\"Ira Judson Condit: In Appreciation\\". California Avocado Society 1946 Yearbook 30. For many years he also investigated problems arising from olive culture in California. edible fig was one of the important objects of Ira Condit's research. Condit is best known today for his work on the large genus Ficus, which includes the edible fig. He wrote early reports on caprifigs (so-called inedible figs), the Kadota fig, and general fig culture.\\"Ira J. Condit Collection\\", Riverside Public Library website After World War I, Condit took a job as horticulturist for the planned J.C. Forkner Fig Gardens, a combination fig ranch and real-estate development project in Fresno, California, that collapsed in the Great Depression. He later served for four years as horticulturist to the California Peach and Fig Growers Association. In 1923, the growers association sent him to Europe to learn about the fig industries of Algeria, Italy, Greece, Turkey, France, Spain and Portugal. In 1935, Condit joined the University of California Citrus Experiment Station in Riverside as Associate Professor and Associate Subtropical Horticulturist. He remained there for many years studying the morphology of the fig flower, fig nomenclature and climatic adaptation, and fig breeding, and he wrote cytological studies of over 30 Ficus species. Among those he studied were Ficus carica (the edible fig), F. benjamina (weeping fig) and F. elastica (rubber plant). In 1947 he published The Fig, his comprehensive monograph on the subject. In 1934-35, Condit was visiting professor at Lingnan University in Canton, China, and also visited the Philippines, Formosa, Japan, and Hawaii. He served as the editor of the Subtropical and Tropical Pomology section of Biological Abstracts, and he was a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Society of Horticultural Science, and the California Botanical Society.

Since mid-2012, each episode of Harmontown had been recorded and released as a podcast, first by Feral Audio through 2017, then Starburns Audio starting in 2018. The podcast had featured many guest appearances, including Game Grumps, Kumail Nanjiani, Greg Proops, Aubrey Plaza, Bobcat Goldthwait, Rob Schrab, Curtis Armstrong, Patton Oswalt, Jason Sudeikis, Dana Carvey, Felicia Day, Robin Williams, Mitch Hurwitz, Joel McHale, Rob Corddry, John Mayer, Eric Idle, Logic, and Steve Agee. On March 8, 2014, a documentary about the podcast, also called Harmontown, premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival.  Premise  The original premise of Harmontown began with Harmon's and Davis's attempts to discuss how to successfully eliminate the flaws of society and create a utopia (which they claimed could be addressed with the creation of a lunar colony) in front of a live audience. The show evolved into what Harmon and Davis call \\"live therapy sessions\\" for Harmon, as he discussed with Davis a variety of topics, from anecdotes about his family and work to commentaries on movies, social issues, and scandals.  Format and structure  Harmontown was not scripted; it was largely improvisational. The show frequently featured many guests to help drive the discussion. On its fifth airing, the show began having a regular Dungeons & Dragons (D&D;) session at the end of each episode. This led to the introduction of Spencer Crittenden, who led their D&D; segments, having extensive knowledge of the game. Crittenden happened to be an audience member when Harmon and Davis asked for assistance from the crowd with how to play D&D.; Crittenden gradually became a part of the main cast. He was then hired as an assistant to Dan Harmon. Beginning in 2015, with episode #131 \\"Dirty Little Potato People\\", the Dungeons & Dragons segment was replaced with a Shadowrun game session, placed towards the end of the episodes and for a similar length as the D&D; segment. Crittenden was also the gamemaster for this segment, with guests optionally filling the roles of some characters in the campaign. From October 2017 to June 2018, the podcast was recorded without an audience due to permit issues with the Starburns Castle venue. When Davis was unavailable, guest comptrollers included Rob Schrab, Erin McGathy, Kumail Nanjiani, Duncan Trussell, and Brandon Johnson, who eventually became Davis's regular replacement near the end of the podcast's run. Occasionally, special guests would serve as comptroller, including Mitchell Hurwitz, Bobcat Goldthwait, and‚Äîon the Harmontown movie tour‚ÄîGilbert Gottfried, Dino Stamatopoulos, Steve Agee, and LeVar Burton.  Tour and documentary  From January 10‚Äì30, 2013, Harmontown evolved from its original format and structure to go on a national tour, leaving Los Angeles and traveling to cities such as Pittsburgh, Austin, and Nashville, all while posting new episodes within two days. The tour became the subject of a documentary produced by director Neil Berkeley. The documentary, also called Harmontown, follows Harmon, Davis, McGathy, and Crittenden. The documentary (Harmontown) premiered at the SXSW Film Festival on March 8, 2014. While Harmontown performed weekly episodes in LA (eventually at the Dynasty Typewriter theater), they would take the show on the road from time to time. In 2016, Harmontown traveled to Australia for a series of performances, and from time to time Harmontown could be found performing at various comedy festivals across the US.

Following season 3 of Community, Sony fired Harmon as show-runner, and many fans noticed the show's tonal shift in season 4 with displeasure. Harmon avoided watching season 4 of his former show for some time, but after finally viewing it, he expressed his opinion of the season during a Harmontown episode. Harmon made comments referencing Jeffery Dahmer (a convicted serial killer and cannibal), and described his experience of watching the season as \\"like flipping through Instagrams and watching your girlfriend just blow a million [other guys].\\" Harmon subsequently publicly apologized for his comments.  Reception  The A.V. Club wrote that \\"The podcast is for fans only, but for that undervalued group, it's essential listening.\\". CraveOnline wrote of the podcast: \\"If you're a Community fan, you're not going to want to miss the brains behind the show. If you're a comedy fan, you're not going to want to miss the show because it is, in all seriousness, the best comedy podcast out there. Harmon is a fantastic talker and storyteller and Davis is just as fantastic to listen to.\\"  References   External links  * 2012 podcast debuts 2019 podcast endings Audio podcasts Comedy and humor podcasts ","title":"Harmontown"},{"id":"42477568","text":"Poia is a village in West Champaran district in the Indian state of Bihar.

After that, he had served until 1860 as a cavalry officer in the Austrian Army's 8th Lancers Regiment, before travelling to Italy to serve under Garibaldi. Wyndham said he had fought with Garibaldi at Palermo, Nuloggo, Rager, and Capua, at the last of which he had been promoted lieutenant-colonel, given command of a brigade, and knighted by King Victor Emmanuel, who had appointed him a knight of the Military Order of Savoy; and that was why he sometimes used the title of \\"Sir\\" in English. He had continued to command a brigade until on 8 October 1861, following the outbreak of the American Civil War, he had been given leave to enable him to offer his services to the Union.Robert J. Trout, Memoirs of the Stuart Horse Artillery Battalion (2008), p. 193 Whatever his origins, Wyndham undoubtedly travelled to North America and served in the Union Army during the Civil War. Taken prisoner by Confederate forces on 6 June 1862, he was exchanged for prisoners of the Confederacy only a few weeks later, and in August 1862 commanded the 1st New Jersey Cavalry Regiment at the Battle of Thoroughfare Gap.John J. Hennessy, Return to Bull Run: the Campaign and Battle of Second Manassas (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1993, ), pp. 153‚Äì161 On 9 June 1863 Wyndham was wounded at the Battle of Brandy Station, and thereafter he served in Washington, D. C. While there, his namesake the English politician Percy S. Wyndham accused him of being a fraud, prompting Wyndham to give an account of his career, supported by documentary evidence.Robert F. O'Neill, Chasing Jeb Stuart and John Mosby: The Union Cavalry in Northern Virginia (2012), pp. 256‚Äì258 His pointed reply to the other Wyndham included the statement that Wyndham applied for promotion to Brigadier, with a recommendation from Major-General Joseph Hooker, who said of him \\"I found him capable, prompt, and efficient... and with an enemy in his front, enterprising and brave\\". However, he was refused the promotion, after a fellow officer had accused him of disloyalty and of considering transferring to the Confederate Army. Wyndham continued to draw his army pay until he retired from the Union's service on 5 July 1864. According to some accounts, he next commanded a military school for boys. In 1866, Wyndham returned to Italy to continue his military service in the Royal Italian Army. That completed, after several failed business ventures he journeyed to India where, after selling his military decorations to support himself, he took to giving hot air ballooning demonstrations to earn a living. On 27 January 1879 he was killed when his balloon burst open and fell from a height of about three hundred feet into a lake near Rangoon, Burma. A newspaper there reported his death, concluding \\"Thus ended a singular and adventurous career\\". His death was noted as far away as the Highlands of Scotland, here is a report from The Inverness Courier, February 6th 1879. All spelling, punctuation and capitalisation as per the original publication. \\"THROWN FROM A BALLOON. News of a sad accident comes from Rangoon. Colonel Percy Wyndham, a gentleman well known in Calcutta and Rangoon, announced an ascent in a balloon of his own construction. After attaining a height of about 500 feet the balloon burst, and the unfortunate aeronaut fell into the Royal lake, whence he was extricated quite dead. Colonel Percy Wyndham was a distinguished soldier of fortune. He served with great credit under General Garibaldi, and the Northern Army during the American War. He came to Calcutta some years ago, where he established a successful comic paper, then he became impresario of the opera, next he entered the services of the King of Burma as Commander-in-Chief. Soon, however, quarrelling with that potentate, he went to Rangoon, where his characteristic death closed a career more chequered than falls the lot of many in this commonplace age.\\" Notes 1833 births 1879 deaths American Civil War prisoners of war People of the Italian unification Royal Artillery soldiers Union Army colonels ","title":"Percy Wyndham (soldier)"},{"id":"42477789","text":"Suver is an unincorporated community in Polk County, Oregon, United States. It is located about 10 miles north of Corvallis and about 8 miles south of Monmouth, 1 mile east of Oregon Route 99W. History Joseph Wellington Suver settled on a donation land claim near Suver in 1845. Suver, the son of John Suver and Catherine (Hanes) Suver, was born in 1814 in Berkeley County, Virginia. When the Oregon & California Railroad was being built through the area in 1880, Joseph Suver bought the present-day site of Suver from his brother-in-law, George W. Pyburn. The town of Suver was platted in 1881. The railroad station on what became the Southern Pacific Railroad line through the community was named Suvers. Another name for the railroad station was Soap Creek. Suver post office was established in 1881 with Sam Cohen as the first postmaster; it ran until 1935. Suver grew to include a store, a sawmill, two warehouses, a grain elevator, a dance hall, a train depot, a blacksmith shop, a shoe repair shop, and several residences by the mid-1890s. Suver school was built in 1895. As of 1915, Suver had a church and its population was 25. The community served as a rural shipping facility and community center for the surrounding area until the mid-1920s, when the completion of Oregon Route 99W caused the decline of shipping by rail and thus the decline of the town. The warehouses, school, and several homes remained for years after the town's heyday. Suver became known as \\"Old Suver\\", which may be confused with \\"New Suver\\" or Suver Junction, a locale where Suver Road forms a crossroads with Oregon Route 99W a mile west of Suver. The store building currently located at Suver Junction was moved from Suver in 1935, and during World War II was the closest privately operated store to thousands of men at Camp Adair. The store was built in 1905 and owned by Fred Strum. As of 1990, Suver was the site of a grain elevator and a rural volunteer fire station; the grain elevator remains today, and the fire station has closed.

A hip hop artist who started under the name Razpy, he built his brand by releasing EPs, touring, and filming music videos through his company Black Umbrella. He gained recognition after releasing his debut solo EP, Solomon Samuel Simone. Simone became the subject of media coverage for his association with the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, part of the George Floyd protests in Seattle.  Biography  = Music = Upon release of his debut solo EP, Solomon Samuel Simone, Simone garnered the attention of 300 Entertainment executives Lyor Cohen, Todd Moscowitz, and Kevin Liles which resulted in a partnership between the newly established 300 Entertainment and his Black Umbrella Imprint. After the success of his debut EP, Simone embarked on a 52 city tour with Rittz of Strange Music and Tuki Carter of Taylor Gang Entertainment. During this time he dropped his first full-length album Cognitive Dissonance. For the first four months of 2015 Simone released new music nearly every week, resulting in three new projects: Cognitive Dissonance: Part 2, Macklemore Privilege & Chief on Keef Violence, and Baby Jesus. In 2016 Simone released Trap Spirituals. He was nominated for XXL's Freshman List. In June 2016 Simone played shows in seven cities, opening for Macklemore and Ryan Lewis. Simone has also collaborated with a variety of rappers, such as Roc Nation label member Jay Park, and GOOD Music artist Pusha T on the track featuring King Leez titled \\"That Ain't Love\\", which was praised by hip-hop blog sites. In May 2020, he threw a \\"pop-up, drive-in concert\\" at a parking lot at Seattle Center. This type of concert was developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to allow for social distancing. = Activism = In June 2020, during the George Floyd protests in Seattle, Simone emerged as an active member of the self-declared Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. CNN described him as the \\"de facto leader of the autonomous zone.\\" Conservative news outlets and publications including Fox News, Townhall, New York Post, and City Journal featured Simone prominently in their coverage of the zone, characterizing him as a \\"warlord\\" policing the area with an AK-47 and highlighting an interaction where he allegedly assaulted a tagger. Video was later released showing Simone distributing firearms to unknown individuals. According to Snopes, conservative social media personality Andy Ngo shared a video on June 15 of Simone distributing a rifle from the trunk of his car to another protester on June 8 (the day the zone was first established), after \\"rumors developed that members of the right-wing group Proud Boys were going to move into the protest area to set fires and stir chaos.\\" Simone disagreed with the characterization that appeared in the media.

The attack reportedly wounded around 100 people (5 seriously) and killed three. Syria's state television, SANA blamed the attack on the Islamist Al-Nusra Front using \\"toxic chlorine\\", while the opposition blamed barrel bombs dropped by government forces. Background The attack took place in Kafr Zita, a rebel- held village located north of Hama, in the context of the Syrian Civil War. According to witnesses interviewed by the OPCW Fact-Finding Mission the village has suffered hundreds of conventional attacks since the start of the conflict in Syria. Incident The chemical attack on 11 April 2014, occurred between 18:00 and 19:00. The bomb was dropped by a helicopter.Newspaper article including a video allegedly showing the explosion of the bomb. \\"Witnesses said they saw or heard a helicopter dropping a barrel bomb followed by an odor they likened to household cleaners.\\" Syria probably dropped chlorine gas on civilians, rights group says, by Raja Abdulrahim, Los Angeles Times, May 13, 2014 Victims The attack reportedly wounded around 100 people. Five were seriously wounded while an elderly man originally from Morek, his daughter, and a little girl died from the attack. =The elderly man= According to VDC, a local monitoring group, the elderly man that died was the 70-year-old Mustafa Ahmad al-Mohammad, an IDP from Morek. According to VDC, he was injured in the head \\"due to explosive barrel shelling on the town\\" and died in Kafr Zita at the day of the attack. This statement was supported by a local doctor and the doctor who heads the health department in Hama, which both said the man died from head injuries. =The daughter of the elderly man= According to VDC, the daughter of the elderly man was Marwa Mustafa Ahmad al-Mohammad, a single 30-year-old woman. According to VDC, she had severe symptoms from chlorine exposure and was transferred to a hospital in Turkey where she died five days after the attack due to inhaling of chemical and toxic gasses. =The little girl= According to the local doctor, the little girl died from shortness of breath, while the doctor from the health department in Hama said she died from head injuries. Initial Claims Both the opposition and Syria's state television claimed that the attack led to the killing of two people and several cases of suffocation and poisoning. =Government claims= On Saturday 12 April, Syria's state television, SANA, claimed that rebels affiliated with the jihadist al-Nusra Front had used \\"toxic chlorine\\" on Friday 11 April while attacking the village of Kafr Zita, and said that \\"the attack led to the killing of two people\\" and that around 100 \\"suffered from suffocation\\". =Opposition claims= According to Rami Abdel Rahman, the director of the pro-opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, \\"regime planes bombed Kafr Zita with explosive barrels that produced thick smoke and odours and led to cases of suffocation and poisoning.\\" Opposition activists said the chemical attack occurred during fierce fighting when government troops appeared to be losing control of the strategic town of Khan Shaykhun. =Local resident claims= Local eyewitnesses interviewed by a Palestinian intelligence expert said a \\"chemical substance\\" had caused smoke and fumes and that the device hadn't been deployed from a plane. \\"None of the two suffocation victims, none of the other victims who were affected but recover, or any of those who provided first aid and medical aid to any of the victims suffered any symptoms which would be consistent with a military-grade chemical weapon\\", the eyewitnesses said. Early Commentaries Experts have stated that while using chlorine is not as deadly as conventional weapons, such chemical strikes are valuable in intimidating rebel factions, and according to David Kay, a former U.N. weapons inspector: \\"says a lot about their [Syrian regimes] lack of fear of consequences. What's the West going to do? It's done nothing so far.\\" However, David Kay is known for his role in backing up the American and British claims that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, and as a senior fellow and vice president of the Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). According to Dina Esfandiary, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the attack was reported as a rebel atrocity on Syrian state TV before it had even happened. Analysis According to Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a director of SecureBio consultancy and a former commander of the British Army's chemical readiness forces, \\"[t]he evidence from Kafr Zita is pretty compelling and is certainly being examined very carefully by officials.\\" Following subsequent scientific analysis of samples from multiple gas attacks, conducted exclusively for The Telegraph, he said: \\"We have unequivocally proved that the regime has used chlorine and ammonia against its own civilians in the last two to three weeks.\\" Independent investigations by reporters from the German magazine Der Spiegel and Daniele Raineri of Italy's Il Foglio found among the remnants of the bombs debris of apparently civilian Chlorine gas cylinders produced by Chinese manufacturer Norinco.Chinese state owned heavy industry giant Norinco manufactures a wide range of commercial products, including chemicals like Chlorine Aftermath Following the attack, Syria's opposition Syrian National Coalition called on the United Nations to investigate the incident, along with a similar alleged chemical attack on the same day in the Harasta suburb of Damascus, which was also allegedly attacked again with chemicals on 16 April. Later chemical attacks were reported in April at Al- Tamanah in Idlib Governorate, Zahraa near Homs and on the 22 April in both the Damascus suburb of Darayya and Talmenes, which is northeast of Kafr Zita. On 19 May, it was alleged that Kafr Zita was again attacked with chlorine, the sixth alleged gas attack in the village in two months, killing one boy and leaving 130 villagers in need of medical attention, including 21 children who were in critical condition. On 21 May, it was again chemically attacked, along with Al-Tamanah, which is located away from Kafr Zita. On 20 April, French president Fran√ßois Hollande claimed that the Syrian government had used chlorine weapons, stating, \\"[w]e have a few elements of information but I do not have the proof\\". This was followed a day later by the U.S. State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki stating, \\"we're examining allegations that the government was responsible. We take all allegations of the use of chemicals in combat use very seriously.\\" However, Andrew Tabler, a Syria expert with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, has remarked on possible American action against the chlorine attacks that \\"Obama has been pronouncing the [Syrian chemical weapons] deal as a victory so I'm not sure he's ready to jump on the chlorine issue.\\" According to an investigation by The Telegraph, comprising testimony from doctors who have treated the wounded, relatives of the victims and eyewitnesses of the latest chemical attacks, it has found \\"evidence of the regime's continued and systematic use of chemical weapons in Syria\\" in order to combat heavy pressure from rebel forces. It also noted the rise in deaths and injuries attributed to the chlorine attacks.

Forkner Fig Gardens (1883-1981) was an early 20th-century real estate development in Fresno, California, United States, that combined home ownership with fig farming. History In 1912, real estate developer Jesse Clayton \\"J.C.\\" Forkner, a transplant from Kansas, envisioned in California's San Joaquin Valley the creation of a development where homeowners would each have enough land for a small but profitable orchard.Honeyman, Kirsten. \\"Fig Gardens: Fresno's 'Fig King'.\\" Pacific Horticulture, Winter 2014. He got a one-year option to purchase of undesirable land from the Bullard Company in what is now northwest Fresno, between the city center and the San Joaquin River. Forkner consulted with a number of California experts about the possibility of fig farming, including University of California, Berkeley, professor Edward J. Wickson and local fig grower Henry Markarian. He later hired another UC professor, Ira J. Condit, as project horticulturist. Forkner expanded his holdings to and began preparing the land for his \\"Fig Gardens.\\" The ambitious scale of the project can be seen in the fact that the development encompassed a streetcar line, over of streets, and an irrigation system with a -long main canal and some of side ditches. To move ahead rapidly, Forkner assembled a mix of horse-drawn Fresno scrapers and over 100 Ford tractors, at one point owning more Ford tractors than anyone else in the world. Planting the figs required blasting holes with dynamite through a top layer of hardpan to reach the underlying soil. Forkner eventually planted some 600,000 fig trees, of which 9 in 10 were edible figs and the remainder ornamental figs. The figs came out of an adjacent nursery stocked in part with cuttings obtained from Markarian, and landowners were permitted to choose among different varieties. The majority of trees planted were Calimyrna figs, with significant acreage also devoted to Kadotas.Vandor, Paul E.

The Valley's Legends & Legacies IV. World Dancer Press, 2002. Despite this early success, the Fig Gardens project collapsed when J.C. Forkner went bankrupt during the Great Depression. The development was named the \\"J.C. Forkner Fig Gardens\\" in early promotional literature, and in 1919 Forkner published a pamphlet entitled The J.C. Forkner Fig Gardens Recipes: How to Serve Figs in the Home. That same year, Forkner and local businessman Wylie M. Giffen subdivided the section of land nearest to Fresno into smaller one-acre and half-acre plots. The Forkner-Giffen section was renamed Old Fig Garden, and it survives today as a census-designated place entirely surrounded by the city of Fresno. Other acreage from the original project has been merged into other sections of Fresno, including the unincorporated community of Figarden.

Prilozh. 12 (1978); English translation in Functional Analysis and its Applications 12 (1978), 212-214 is the rough duality between the derived category of a symmetric algebra and that of an exterior algebra. The importance of the notion rests on the suspicion that Koszul duality seems quite ubiquitous in nature. Koszul Duality for modules over Koszul algebras The simplest, and in a sense prototypical case of Koszul duality arises as follows: for a 1-dimensional vector space V over a field k, with dual vector space V^*, the exterior algebra of V has two non-trivial components, namely :\\\\bigwedge^1 V=V, \\\\bigwedge^0 V = k. This exterior algebra and the symmetric algebra of V^*, Sym(V^*), serve to build a two-step chain complex :V \\\\otimes_k Sym(V^*) \\\\to k \\\\otimes_k Sym(V^*) whose differential is induced by natural evaluation map :V \\\\otimes_k V^* \\\\to k, v \\\\otimes \\\\varphi \\\\mapsto \\\\varphi(v). Choosing a basis of V, Sym(V^*) can be identified with the polynomial ring in one variable, k[t], and the previous chain complex becomes isomorphic to the complex :k[t] \\\\stackrel t \\\\to k[t] whose differential is multiplication by t. This computation shows that the cohomology of the above complex is 0 at the left hand term, and is k at the right hand term. In other words, k (regarded as a chain complex concentrated in a single degree) is quasi-isomorphic to the above complex, which provides a close link between the exterior algebra of V and the symmetric algebra of its dual. =Koszul dual of a Koszul algebra= Koszul duality, as treated by Alexander Beilinson, Victor Ginzburg, and Wolfgang SoergelAlexander Beilinson, Victor Ginzburg, Wolfgang Soergel. Koszul duality patterns in representation theory, Journal of the American Mathematical Society 9 (1996), no. 2, 473-527. can be formulated using the notion of Koszul algebra. An example of such a Koszul algebra A is the symmetric algebra S(V) on a finite-dimensional vector space. More generally, any Koszul algebra can be shown to be a quadratic algebra, i.e., of the form :A = T(V) / R, where T(V) is the tensor algebra on a finite- dimensional vector space, and R is a submodule of T^2(V) = V \\\\otimes V. The Koszul dual then coincides with the quadratic dual :A^! := T(V^*) / R' where V^* is the (k-linear) dual and R' \\\\subset V^* \\\\otimes V^* consists of those elements on which the elements of R (i.e., the relations in A) vanish. The Koszul dual of A=S(V) is given by A^! = \\\\Lambda(V^*), the exterior algebra on the dual of V. In general, the dual of a Koszul algebra is again a Koszul algebra. Its opposite ring is given by the graded ring of self-extensions of the underlying field k, thought of as an A-module: :(A^!)^{\\\\text{opp}} = \\\\operatorname{Ext}^*_A(k, k). =Koszul duality= If an algebra A is Koszul, there is an equivalence between certain subcategories of the derived categories of graded A\\\\- and A^!-modules. These subcategories are defined by certain boundedness conditions on the grading vs. the cohomological degree of a complex. =Variants= As an alternative to passing to certain subcategories of the derived categories of A and A^! to obtain equivalences, it is possible instead to obtain equivalences between certain quotients of the homotopy categories. Usually these quotients are larger than the derived category, as they are obtained by factoring out some subcategory of the category of acyclic complexes, but they have the advantage that every complex of modules determines some element of the category, without needing to impose boundedness conditions. A different reformulation gives an equivalence between the derived category of A and the 'coderived' category of the coalgebra (A^!)^*. An extension of Koszul duality to D-modules states a similar equivalence of derived categories between dg-modules over the dg-algebra \\\\Omega_X of K√§hler differentials on a smooth algebraic variety X and the D_X- modules.

Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1990. xii+316 pp. . Section VI.3 Koszul duality for operads An extension of the above concept of Koszul duality was formulated by Ginzburg and Kapranov who introduced the notion of a quadratic operad and defined the quadratic dual of such an operad.Ginzburg, Victor; Kapranov, Mikhail. Koszul duality for operads. Duke Math. J. 76 (1994), no. 1, 203‚Äì272. Very roughly, an operad is an algebraic structure consisting of an object of n-ary operations for all n. An algebra over an operad is an object on which these n-ary operations act. For example, there is an operad called the associative operad whose algebras are associative algebras, i.e., depending on the precise context, non- commutative rings (or, depending on the context, non-commutative graded rings, differential graded rings). Algebras over the so-called commutative operad are commutative algebras, i.e., commutative (possibly graded, differential graded) rings. Yet another example is the Lie operad whose algebras are Lie algebras. The quadratic duality mentioned above is such that the associative operad is self-dual, while the commutative and the Lie operad correspond to each other under this duality. Koszul duality for operads states an equivalence between algebras over dual operads. The special case of associative algebras gives back the functor A \\\\mapsto A^! mentioned above.

She served primarily as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named for York, Ontario, however due to possible confusion with , her name reflects a connection with that community. Prince Rupert was ordered in June 1942 as part of the 1942‚Äì1943 River-class building program. She was laid down on 11 September 1943 by Canadian Vickers Ltd. at Montreal, Quebec and launched 27 November later that year. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 14 June 1944 at Montreal. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti- submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. War service After working up at Bermuda, Runnymede was assigned to Mid-Ocean Escort Force escort group C-5. She was used as a trans-Atlantic convoy escort until May 1945 and as Senior Officer's Ship for the group. The group was known as the \\"Barber Pole Squadron\\" for the markings on their funnels. Arriving at Halifax in June 1945 Runnymede was quickly turned around and set off for Esquimalt, British Columbia to undergo a tropicalization refit in preparation for service in the southern Pacific Ocean. This meant installing refrigeration, water-cooling and a change to her camouflage pattern. She commenced the refit in August 1945 at North Vancouver. However, due to the surrender of Japan, the refit was cancelled and Runnymede sailed to Esquimalt where she was placed in reserve and only paid off 19 January 1946. After the war she was sold to Capital Iron & Metals Ltd. of Victoria, British Columbia for scrapping in 1947. Her hull was stripped and it was expended as a breakwater in Kelsey Bay, British Columbia. References ;Notes ;References *Macpherson, Ken; Burgess, John.

During his career he served as the Communist Party Secretary of the city of Jinzhong in Shanxi province, the director of propaganda of Shanxi province, and the Party Secretary of Taiyuan, the provincial capital. In September 2010 Shen was transferred to work for the Central Propaganda Department of the Communist Party under Liu Yunshan. After the 18th Party Congress, Shen became a leading figure in the China Association for Science and Technology. He was removed from office in April 2014 by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI); Shen himself was a member of the CCDI. His downfall was notable for the CCDI investigating 'one of their own.' He was sentenced to life in prison in 2016. Career Shen was born and raised in Lucheng County, Shanxi province. Shen entered Shanxi University in April 1972, majoring in physical education, where he graduated in December 1975. Shen became involved in politics in August 1969 and joined the Communist Party of China in January 1979. Shen rose through the ranks to become the CPC Party Secretary of Jinzhong in May 2000. That same year, he was elevated to head the Shanxi Provincial Propaganda Department of the Communist Party. In January 2006, Shen was transferred to Taiyuan, capital of Shanxi Province, and he was appointed the Party Secretary of Taiyuan, a position he held until September 2010. According to Chinese-language media, locals appraisal of Shen's time at the helm of the provincial capital was summed up with the line, \\"he sold a lot of land, filmed a tv show, and slept with a bunch of women.\\" Shen was allegedly involved in a relationship with a prominent singer from Shanxi province (she was not named in reports). The province's richest man, Zhang Xinming, was reported to have given 5 million yuan (~$812,000) to one of the singer's concerts in order to curry favour with Shen. In September 2010, Shen was transferred to Beijing and appointed the Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China, working as the assistant to then-Director Liu Yunshan. He remained in that position until April 2013, when he was promoted to become the Party Group Secretary of China Association for Science and Technology, the largest civic organization overseeing work in science and technology in China with a membership of over 430,000. At the 18th Party Congress Shen was also elected as a member of the 18th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. In February 2014, Shen's former colleague Jin Daoming, then the Vice-Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial People's Congress, was held for investigation. It was reported that Jin gave evidence that implicated Shen in corruption. On April 12, 2014, Shen was being investigated by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China for \\"serious violations of laws and regulations\\". Shen is the first provincial-ministerial official to be implicated in 2014 as part of the massive anti-corruption campaign following the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. He was also the first member of the 18th CCDI itself that was investigated for corruption. In December 2014, Shen was expelled from the Communist Party of China. The party investigation concluded that Shen \\"abused his power for the illicit gain of others, took massive bribes, received gifts of cash, and committed adultery.\\" His case was forwarded to judicial authorities for prosecution. Shen was sentenced for life in prison for bribery on October 11, 2016. Personal life Shen spent much of his career in sports administration, and excelled at sports. He was known to be warm, good-looking, and extraordinarily talkative, often giving lengthy speeches at meetings. Shen is tall.

MS 572 was designated in 1957, from MS 24 and MS 33 to MS 569. The route was extended west to Centreville, and was removed from the state highway system in 1967. Route description As of 1965, the route was located in eastern Wilkinson and western Amite counties. All of the route was a two-laned paved road. MS 572 began at the center of Centreville, near a railroad track. The route then traveled down Park Road until it exited Wilkinson County and entered Amite County. After crossing the county line, MS 572 intersected MS 24 and MS 33, and MS 572 was also branded Lower Centreville Road. Continuing eastward, the route exited Centreville and crossed over Beaver Creek and emerged into the village of Olio. MS 572 left Olio, and ended few miles later at MS 569 at a T-intersection. Lower Centreville Road continued east, concurrent with MS 569. MS 572 was maintained by the Mississippi State Highway Commission and Amite County, as part of the state highway system. History MS 572 was designated in 1957, connecting from MS 24/33 to MS 569. The route was fully paved when it was created. The next year, it was extended slightly to Centreville. By 1960, a section of the route in Amite County was transferred to county maintenance. MS 572 was removed from the state highway system by 1967.

It is defined as the ratio of areas of the largest axially symmetric subset of the shape to the whole shape. Equivalently it is the largest fraction of the area of the shape that can be covered by a mirror reflection of the shape (with any orientation). A shape that is itself axially symmetric, such as an isosceles triangle, will have an axiality of exactly one, whereas an asymmetric shape, such as a scalene triangle, will have axiality less than one. Upper and lower bounds showed that every convex set has axiality at least 2/3.. Erratum, . This result improved a previous lower bound of 5/8 by .. As cited by . The best upper bound known is given by a particular convex quadrilateral, found through a computer search, whose axiality is less than 0.816.. For triangles and for centrally symmetric convex bodies, the axiality is always somewhat higher: every triangle, and every centrally symmetric convex body, has axiality at least 2(\\\\sqrt{2}-1)\\\\approx 0.828. In the set of obtuse triangles whose vertices have x-coordinates 0, \\\\sqrt 2, and 1, the axiality approaches 2(\\\\sqrt{2}-1) in the limit as the y-coordinates approach zero, showing that the lower bound is as large as possible. It is also possible to construct a sequence of centrally symmetric parallelograms whose axiality has the same limit, again showing that the lower bound is tight.. As cited by .. Algorithms The axiality of a given convex shape can be approximated arbitrarily closely in sublinear time, given access to the shape by oracles for finding an extreme point in a given direction and for finding the intersection of the shape with a line.. consider the problem of computing the axiality exactly, for both convex and non-convex polygons. The set of all possible reflection symmetry lines in the plane is (by projective duality) a two-dimensional space, which they partition into cells within which the pattern of crossings of the polygon with its reflection is fixed, causing the axiality to vary smoothly within each cell. They thus reduce the problem to a numerical computation within each cell, which they do not solve explicitly. The partition of the plane into cells has O(n^4) cells in the general case, and O(n^3) cells for convex polygons; it can be constructed in an amount of time which is larger than these bounds by a logarithmic factor. Barequet and Rogol claim that in practice the area maximization problem within a single cell can be solved in O(n) time, giving (non-rigorous) overall time bounds of O(n^4) for the convex case and O(n^5) for the general case.. Related concepts lists 11 different measures of axial symmetry, of which the one described here is number three.. He requires each such measure to be invariant under similarity transformations of the given shape, to take the value one for symmetric shapes, and to take a value between zero and one for other shapes. Other symmetry measures with these properties include the ratio of the area of the shape to its smallest enclosing symmetric superset, and the analogous ratios of perimeters. , as well as studying axiality, studies a restricted version of axiality in which the goal is to find a halfspace whose intersection with a convex shape has large area lies entirely within the reflection of the shape across the halfspace boundary. He shows that such an intersection can always be found to have area at least 1/8 that of the whole shape. In the study of computer vision, proposed to measure the symmetry of a digital image (viewed as a function w from points in the plane to grayscale intensity values in the interval 0\\\\le w(p)\\\\le 1) by finding a reflection \\\\sigma that maximizes the area integral :\\\\frac{\\\\int\\\\int w(p) w(\\\\sigma(p))dx\\\\,dy}{\\\\int\\\\int w(p)^2 dx\\\\,dy}. When w is the indicator function of a given shape, this is the same as the axiality.

The bees then chase Humphrey, forcing him to hide underwater in a nearby pond. Donald complains to Ranger Woodlore, who assembles his bears and informs them of Donald's predicament. Told that someone is stealing Mr. Duck's honey, the entire group expresses mock outrage. Humphrey, who is the last bear to arrive, is still dripping from being in the pond. When Woodlore asks him why he is always wet, and he responds by making body-washing gestures, Woodlore tells him that he bathes too much. The Ranger then shows the bears the property boundary line between their park and Donald's honey farm. Donald puts up a barbed wire fence to keep the bears out, but this does not stop Humphrey, who uses a sign to prop it up. After failing twice to outsmart the bees, Humphrey uses a hose to try to obtain the honey, but Donald takes the hose and fills it with water to make look like honey running through, which squirts in his face and catapults, Humphrey, Donald and Woodlore into the pond, after which Woodlore hits him on the head and says, \\"You take too many baths!\\" FilmAffinity Voice cast * Donald Duck: Clarence Nash * Humphrey the Bear: Jimmy MacDonald * J.

In 1973 he was appointed Minister of Dutch and Flemish cultural affairs in the Belgian Government Leburton. Barely a year later he became Minister of Transport, Communications & Energy. A position he would eventually carry six years. It is in this era of policy making, Chabert realised his greatest achievements. He is the founder of the speed limit to 120 kilometers per hour, the alcohol limit to 0.8‚Ä∞ and the mandatory seat belt. Afterwards he was still Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Public Works. Early 1982 Chabert disappeared from the federal government scene, looking for another challenge. He became Belgian representative at the United Nations General Assembly and later Belgian Commissioner General for World Expo in Tsukuba in Japan. At the end of the 80s, Chabert returned to politics. He stood in the front row when the Brussels-Capital Region was held over the baptismal font. He was a long-time Minister for the Budget, Economy and Finance. In 1999 he became Minister of Public Works & Transport.

(ed) The Europeans: √âmigr√© artists in Australia 1930-1960, National Gallery of Australia, 1997 Early life He was born as Ernest Fuchs in 1906 in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, when it was part of Austria-Hungary. His family moved to Vienna in 1908 where he went on to study architecture, completing a doctorate in Technical Science with a major in Town Planning, and opening his own architectural practice in 1932. Facing extreme anti-semitism, in 1939 he migrated to Australia via Canada, where he married his wife Noem. They arrived in Melbourne in April, and he soon gained a position as a town planner with the nascent Housing Commission Victoria.Townsend, Catherine, \\"Architects, exiles, 'new' Australian's\\" in SAHANZ Annual Conference papers, 1998 In 1944 he was appointed the first lecturer in town planning at the Melbourne Technical College (now the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology). In 1945 he became an Australian citizen and anglicised his name to Fooks. Three years later he resigned from Housing Commission Victoria and opened his own practice. In August 1948 he was elected Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and was later elected President of the Jewish Society of Arts.Edquist, Harriet, The Jewish Contribution: A Missing Chapter, 1993 Key influences and design approach Fooks was a key proponent of the International Modern Movement in Australian architecture.

From 1950, his firm designed over forty apartment blocks in and around the Eastern suburbs of Melbourne. By the mid 1950s, his practice expanded to take on commercial projects including La Ronde jewellery shop in Collins Street, Melbourne CBD, Capri Espresso Bar in Footscray and the Public Trustees Building in Exhibition St.45 Storeys: A Retrospective of Works by Melbourne Jewish architects from 1945 (1993) =Early Houses, 1948‚Äì53= Fooks created houses of architectural significance with individual, and highly creative designs which combined analytical planning with aspects of Scandinavian and European modern design and incorporated principles of traditional Japanese architecture.Edquist, Harriet (2001) . \\"Ernest, Fooks : Architect\\", p. 11-23. School of Architecture and Design RMIT. . Fooks' residential architecture underwent three distinct phases, the first of which expressed post-war austerity through conventional forms and finishes. There was a common and straightforward vocabulary in Fooks' early houses which included plain face cream or yellow brickwork, basic hipped or gabled terracotta roofs and simple double-fronted facades. Though these early designs were simple in form, Fooks' was beginning to introduce sophisticated modernist ideas and features. His Sternberg House in Kew (1948) was designed on the \\"principles of solar control\\"Philip Goad, \\"The Modern House in Melbourne\\", 1945 to 1975\\", Ph D Thesis, University of Melbourne, September 1992, p 6/56. and incorporated almost full height windows, glazed doors and generous paved terrace areas. =Middle Period, 1954‚Äì59= Fooks' middle period exhibited an International Modern style, characterised by low-pitched, flat and butterfly roofs, and bold massings of box-like forms that projected and receded to create striking spaces of solids and voids in finishes of brick and feature stonework. His Appel House in Caulfield North (1955) was a two-storey flat-roofed house with generous windows, and cream brick walls relieved by a broad stone-clad chimney and simple but elegant metal balustrades to the first floor balcony and roof terrace above. = Later Houses, 1960 onwards= Finally, Fooks' Mature, Minimalist style was characterised by efficient structural forms, a reduced palette of materials, generous amounts of glass and elegantly simple details.Philip Goad, \\"The Modern House in Melbourne\\", 1945 to 1975\\", Ph D Thesis, University of Melbourne, September 1992, p 6/56. His domestic projects involved complex and carefully detailed multi-layered open-plan living and thoughtfully constructed surrounding landscapes.Edquist, Harriet (2001) . \\"Ernest, Fooks : Architect\\", p. 11-23. School of Architecture and Design RMIT. . His Lansell Rd House (1963) is of aesthetic significance for its high level of craftsmanship in joinery and finishes in folding and sliding screens and built-in teak furniture and cabinetry. Fooks saw apartment living as a necessity in successful urban planning.Kevin Borland: \\"architecture from the heart\\", Doug Evans, Huan Chen Borland, Conrad Hamann, RMIT University Press, 2006, . His book ‚ÄúXray the City: The Density Diagram, Basis for Urban Planning‚Äù, published in 1946, with a foreword by H.C. Coombs, the Director- General for the Ministry of Post-War Reconstruction, showcased his ideas and voiced his concerns regarding construction and environments in post-war Melbourne. He was the first to discuss the issue of increasing urban density, well ahead of government legislation acknowledging the same issue more than half a century later.Noemi Fooks, \\"An architect rebuilds his life\\", in Karl Bittman (ed), Strauss to Matilda: Viennese in Australia, 1938 to 1988, p 219. Fooks noted that density alone was not responsible for poor urban living conditions, but that the quality of urban living was related to socio-economic factors, community life and access to quality housing and open spaces for leisure.Edquist, Harriet (2001) . \\"Ernest, Fooks : Architect\\", p. 11-23. School of Architecture and Design RMIT. . Fooks died on 4 December 1985 aged 79. The annual Ernest Fooks Memorial Award was established in his honour by the University of Melbourne for excellence in architectural design.

It was installed during the Cold War in both communist and capitalist countries. United States In 1959, Popular Mechanics wrote that a Kiwanis Club in Ontario, California was \\"in tune with the times\\" when it erected a three-story rocketship in a local playground. Around 1962, a high moon rocket was installed in a playground in Calwa, California. The \\"Calwa Rocket\\" still stands in the park \\"as an affectionate symbol of an earlier time,\\" and was designated a heritage property in 2013. The \\"space-age shift\\" in playground design was described in a 1963 issue of Life magazine, which featured Fidel Castro on the cover. A row of tree trunks installed in a Kansas City, Missouri park could elicit \\"any game an imaginative child might think up,\\" including \\"an array of ICBMs on a launch pad.\\" By 1963, Philadelphia had installed 160 space-aged playgrounds, which featured satellites, rockets, and submarines. Richardson, Texas installed a space-themed playground in 1965, with a radar tower, Saturn climber, submarine, radar dish, planet climber, and three-story high rocket ship. When the city tried to replace the playground equipment in 2008, it was met with local opposition. A task force established to investigate the removal found the rocket ship had \\"very limited play value,\\" and had \\"hazardous conditions that present a great danger to young children.\\" The playground equipment was dismantled despite the objections. Two companies were noted for their military and space-themed playground equipment: Miracle Equipment Company of Grinnell, Iowa, and Jamison Fantasy Equipment of Los Angeles, California, which manufactured a moon rocket, nautilus submarine, and space slide. Author Fraser MacDonald wrote \\"nuclear weapons were made intelligible in, and transposable to, a domestic context\\" through children's toys and playground equipment featuring Cold War symbols. Eastern Bloc Playgrounds in the Soviet Union were also designed to stimulate children's excitement about space, as this was an ideology supported across Communist states. Eastern Europe \\"followed the Soviet playgrounds movement and was under the influence of the Cold War fashion.\\" The success of the Soviet space program was celebrated through monuments, parks and museums. Still today in the village of Baikonur, Kazakhstan, where Yuri Gagarin was launched into orbit in 1961, rocket-shaped playground equipment and other mementos of Soviet space exploration are scattered around the village. Playground equipment-- including rockets--was usually mass-produced at large manufacturing plants which tended to follow repetitive designs and patterns. As a result, playgrounds across the Soviet sphere of influence often featured identical equipment, with \\"brutal construction\\" and \\"generous use of old tires.\\" Gallery File:Radar Climber, Riverside Park, Riverside, Iowa.jpg|Radar climber in Riverside, Iowa, United States File:Soviet playground Rocket.jpg|Soviet Space Probe File:Sunset Park, Washington, Iowa.jpg|Missile in Washington, Iowa, United States File:Playground apparatus in Thetford, England, 2008.jpg|Thetford, England File:TexasRichardson rocketShipSlide.jpg|Richardson, Texas, United States File:Fotothek df ps 0003578 Schl√∂sser ^ Stadtschl√∂sser ^ Kinder ^ Kinderbesch√§ftigung.jpg|Dresden, East Germany.

The film is the first appearance of Louie the Mountain Lion. In this episode, Donald is tricked into thinking he's getting attacked by a cougar. Plot The cartoon opens with what appears to be one of Donald's nephews hunting a mountain lion in the forest, which turns out to be the three of them practicing: one is hunting the other two who are acting in a lion suit. Upon finding Donald's house, they notice Donald is baking a pie and decide to use their lion suit to distract him so they can get the pie for themselves. One of the nephews then comes to Donald's house screaming, telling him there is a mountain lion outside. Donald rushes out with his gun but is chased away from the cottage by the two in the lion suit while the other obtains the pie. The disguised nephews follow Donald up a tree, but their disguise gets blown. One of them tries to convince Donald that this was merely a joke, but Donald scolds the nephews and gets his pie back. After telling them to stay out, he goes back to his home to continue baking. While the nephews are lamenting over their failure to accomplish their goal, Louie the Mountain Lion comes along and scares them away. He then turns his attention to Donald, who he views as an easy, tasty meal. He pounces on him, but Donald, thinking it is another trick by the nephews, repeatedly slaps Louie across the face, spanks him on the bottom with his tail, threatens to tear him apart if he saw (them) again and storms back into the house with his pie. Louie later becomes interested in the pie and eats part of it before Donald intervenes. Louie then bursts into the house and smashes the door on Donald, destroying his pie in the process. Still thinking that Louie is the nephews in disguise, he pulls at the mountain lion's head to try and pull it off. But when the nephews show him their lion suit, he still pulls at Louie's head while telling them to be quiet, and continues to yell at Louie to give, but soon realizes his mistake when he does a double take and notices the nephews are outside and that Louie is a real lion. Donald tries to apologize to the mountain lion, but Louie is beyond forgiving and gives a loud roar, whose sound waves knock Donald through a door into his hunting trophy room. Donald tries to fool him by posing as a decoy duck, but Louie sees past this. After a wild chase around the house, Louie chases him into a tree and claws away all the leaves trying to reach Donald. The nephews then give Donald a pie, which he gives to Louie, who decides not to eat Donald. And the pie process continues as the cartoon closes.

Biography  He was a son of Afonso Furtado Mendo√ßa, commander of Beja and Rio Maior and D. Joana Sousa. Andr√© Furtado was curious to develop combat knowledge and he started to study combat, meteorology and oceanography and cartography when he was 18 years old. He joined forces and became successful captain at the age of 25 years. He took part in notable battles including Battle of Flores. He served some of the Portuguese colonial countries in the Indian Ocean for the Portuguese Empire. He died due to illness in April 1611 and buried at the church of Covenant of Grace () in Lisbon.  Portuguese Ceylon  Andr√© Furtado de Mendon√ßa led the forces of a company of 1,400 Portuguese and 3,000 lascarins against King Puviraja Pandaram as the second expedition in Mannar and gained victory, and continued his campaign to the heartland of the Jaffna kingdom. Captain Andr√© Furtado killed king Puvirasa Pandaram in 1591. After the death of Puvirasa Pandaram, his son Ethirimana Cinkam was installed as the ruler by Andr√© Furtado. It created Portuguese overlordship in the region including freedom to Catholic Christian missions. Earlier, Christian missionaries were not allowed during the rule of Puvirasa Pandaram. Gradually, the incumbent king resisted Portuguese overlordship until he was ousted and hanged by Filipe de Oliveira in 1619.  Portuguese Malacca  In April 1606, Portuguese forces under the captainship of Andr√© Furtado were besieged in Malacca by a Dutch fleet under the command of Cornelis Matelief de Jonge. Portuguese forces were no match to Dutch due to disproportional size of men and vessels. However, they managed to resist the besiegers until August 1606 and received support from Viceroy Martim Afonso de Castro.  Portuguese India  Andr√© Furtado engaged with several battles in India, including fierce battle with Kunhali Marakkar. His forces bombarded Marakkar fort from the sea while allies Samoodiri attacked it from the land in 1600. Kunjali Marakkar surrendered to Samoothiri as he lost the battle. Finally, The Portuguese seized the Kunjali, against the terms of the surrender, during a tumult caused by an enemy attack. Then Furtado ordered the fort and the town razed, the Kunjali executed, quartered, and his body displayed on a pike. After the death of viceroy D. Jo√£o Pereira Forjaz in 1609, Andr√© Furtado became the Governor of Portuguese India for only three months until the arrival of new viceroy Rui Louren√ßo Tavora.

They are mostly found preserved in karstic deposits. These animals were small in size, and generally did not exceed in height at the shoulders, ranging in size from those of rabbits to tragulids. For a long time, they were considered to have a similar lifestyle to hares and rabbits. The dentition was full and highly selenodont, i.e. the premolars and molars had curved and crescent-shaped cutting edges (as in today's ruminants). The skull was small, with a short snout and orbits closed posteriorly placed at the center of the skull. A peculiar characteristic of this group were the auditory bulla, protective structures of the bones of the ear : they were very large, like those that are found today in small mammals that live in open and dry environments. This evolved cranial anatomy was in stark contrast to the rest of the skeleton, rather primitive: the cainotherids still possessed four non-reduced toes (an ancestral condition of the artiodactyls), even if the lateral fingers were shorter; they ended in long claws, as in modern rabbits. The hind legs were much longer than the front ones, and indicate a remarkable adaptation to running and jumping.  Classification  The bizarre anatomical features of the cainoterids denote them as primitive artiodactyls. Previous research placed them near to Tylopoda, more recent research places them closer to Ruminantia. Robiacina of the middle/upper Eocene was previously classified as a member of this family, but has been more recently split into a separate family as the sister taxon to Cainotheriidae. In the course of the Upper Eocene primitive genera such as Oxacron and Paroxacron developed, considered the first true cainoterids as sister taxa in the subfamily Oxacroninae. Subsequently, in the course of the Oligocene, the subfamily Cainotheriinae underwent a discrete evolutionary radiation, with diversified genera such as Procaenotherium, the rabbit-sized Plesiomeryx, and the decidedly larger Caenomeryx. The most specialized genus, Cainotherium, was also the last to disappear, during the middle Miocene. Even at the beginning of the Miocene, these animals were quite common in various parts of Europe, with numerous species (e.g. C. laticurvatum, C. miocenicum, C. bavaricum). The cainotherids died out definitively when, during the Miocene, the climate became colder.  Paleoecology  These small ungulate animals possessed exceptionally long hind legs; this characteristic, combined with small size and large auditory bulla, has led many scholars to consider cainoterids a sort of ecological parallel of rabbits. It was therefore assumed that these animals proceeded to leap thanks to the long hind legs, but the discovery of fossil traces of the lower Miocene found in the locality of Salinas de Anana in Spain, clearly left by Cainotherium, showed that the locomotion of these animals had to be very different from that of rabbits, and quite similar to that of the current small ruminants.

A lifelong love of baseball led him to membership in the Society for American Baseball Research, where he became an active member of the Biographical Committee, researching the lives of early major league baseball players. Morris is a highly respected baseball researcher, and is often interviewed or cited by major media outlets such as National Public Radio. He has written or co-authored nine books (as of 2014), including the major two-volume work A Game of Inches: The Stories Behind the Innovations that Shaped Baseball in 2006, the first book to ever win both the Society for American Baseball Research‚Äôs Seymour Medal and the Casey Award. In 2012, he served on the Baseball Hall of Fame‚Äôs pre-integration committee. Early life and education Peter Morris was the first child of Ray and Ruth Morris. When he was two years old, the family moved to Washington, D.C. They moved again when he was seven, to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where he grew up. He obtained a B.A. in English from the University of Toronto. In addition to his interest in baseball, Morris was a keen and talented Scrabble player. After completing his B.A., he moved to East Lansing, Michigan, where he was able to hone his skills against many highly skilled players. He won the National Scrabble Championship in 1989, and was the first winner of the World Scrabble Championship, held in London, England in 1991. With no further goals to achieve in Scrabble, he largely dropped out of competitive play soon after his World Championship. Morris also completed an M.A. in English at Michigan State University.

Morris‚Äô first book, Baseball Fever: Early Baseball in Michigan, won the Society for American Baseball Research‚Äôs Seymour Medal in 2004 for the best book on baseball history. He followed this up with his epic two-volume A Game of Inches: The Stories Behind the Innovations That Shaped Baseball, which solidified his reputation as an expert researcher in baseball history. This became the first book ever to win both the Seymour Medal and the Casey Award for best baseball book of the year. Each of Morris‚Äô subsequent books reflects his meticulous research and his dedication to uncovering forgotten details from the early history of baseball. In Cracking Baseball‚Äôs Cold Cases, Morris describes some of the work that he and other members of the Society for American Baseball Research‚Äôs Biographical Committee do to fill out and correct details of nineteenth-century baseball players as listed in the Baseball Encyclopedia. He outlines the lives of 17 of these players, and the challenges and triumphs that were involved in tracking them down.

This is the second episode to feature Louie and the only episode where he is shown to have a son. The film's plot centers on the lions trying to steal Donald's catch of fish. The title is a pun on the phrase \\"hook, line and sinker\\". Synopsis Louie the Mountain Lion is fishing while sitting in a tree, but has not had any success so far. His son comes out of their nearby den and playfully tricks his father into thinking he has caught a fish by pouncing onto the bait. When Louie reels his son in and realizes that this was a joke, he gives his son a mild pummeling and returns to his fishing spot. His son comes back out and sees Donald Duck returning to his house with a catch of fish. As Donald walks up the dock, he accidentally drops one of his fish, and Louie's son fetches it and brings it back to his dad. Louie, meanwhile, is finally able to catch a fish of his own, but upon seeing the much larger fish his son has brought, he and his son decide to go to Donald's house to get more. Upon arriving, though, they realize that they will have to approach undetected, as three previous intruder lions were shot and their heads made into taxidermy mounts. At first, Louie tries to get his paw inside, but Donald lifts off a stove lid which burns Louie's paw. His son laughs at this, but Louie quiets him down and tries again. Donald, however, was anticipating this and fires his gun at him, putting bullet shells in Louie's rear end. Louie's son removes them, much to his father's pain. The lions try again to get some fish, this time with Louie's son sneaking inside through the wood box. Again, the plan is unsuccessful, but Donald merely throws Louie's son out the window, rather than fire his gun at him. Louie, who quickly becomes fed up with his son's frustration-based babbling, puts him in a barrel and tries yet again. This time, the plan initially works, with Louie raising the fish up on a hook out of the chimney, until he takes a fish right out of Donald's hands and knocks him against the ceiling. Donald goes for his gun again and shoots Louie, provoking his son to remove the shells from inside the barrel on which his dad is sitting. The lions' final plan to get the fish is successful, but they accidentally take Donald (and all his clothes off in the process) and Donald's gun as well. In the chaos, Donald gets his gun and clothes back and shoots at Louie once again. He outruns the shells until thwarted by the walls of his cave, after which Louie is once more hit in the rear end, and his son once again removes the shells from his bottom.

The thirty-one room Romanesque mansion was completed in 1895. The home is named for William Lewis Moody, Jr., an American financier and entrepreneur in the cotton business who bought the home from Galveston socialite Narcissa Willis. The mansion was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 13, 1994. Tours are offered, and the facilities can be rented out for weddings and other events.Moody Mansion Construction and history The mansion was commissioned by Galveston socialite Narcissa Willis in 1893.Wiencek, Henry. The Moody Mansion and Museum. Galveston, TX: Mary Moody Northern, Inc., 1991. Throughout her life, Willis had asked her husband, entrepreneur and cotton broker Richard S. Willis, to build a grand home. Willis demurred as he preferred to keep his assets liquid to be distributed among his ten children on his death. After Richard Willis' died in 1892, Narcissa had the home she and her husband shared torn down and began plans to build a more opulent home on the site. For this act, Willis was estranged from her family until her death in 1899. Her children never visited the opulent mansion designed to bring them back to Galveston. Willis lived alone in the house with a single housekeeper who was paid $1,000 a year, three times the wages domestics earned at the time. Willis commissioned an English architect, William H. Tyndall, to design the home. Following the style of Richard Norman Shaw, Tyndall used elements from different cultures and periods, leading to an eclectic appearance. The interiors were designed by Pottier & Stymus, a famous New York firm of the time that also worked for such clients as Thomas Edison, William Rockefeller, and President Ulysses S. Grant. Upon Narcissa Willis' death in 1899, her daughter Beatrice put the home up for sale. Libbie Moody, who lived in a home nearby the mansion, asked her husband, William Lewis Moody, Jr., to put in a bid for the mansion. After the Hurricane of 1900 devastated Galveston that September, many of the bidders pulled out of the sale. Moody won the mansion for $20,000, a fraction of the mansion's over $100,000 worth. Moody, his wife and four children promptly moved into the home and celebrated their first Christmas at the mansion in 1900. Members of the Moody family resided in the home until 1986 when it was turned into a historic museum commemorating the Moody family. Hurricanes continue to affect the history of the home. In September 2008, Hurricane Ike led to the flooding of the basement. Libbie Moody's potting room and the period kitchen were lost. As of July 2014, the basement was opened as the Galveston Children's Museum.Galveston Children's Museum Layout The home has thirty-one rooms and five bathrooms. Tyndall incorporated many technological advances of the period including a one- passenger elevator, a dumbwaiter, speaking tubes in the pantry for communicating with the kitchen staff in the basement, heated drying racks in the laundry room, and lighting fixtures using both gas and electricity. The house also has its own rainwater cistern. The home has four floors. The basement which contained the servant's quarters and kitchen is on the ground floor. =First floor= * Entryway - The entryway is decorated with oak paneling of a classical design derived from the Doric order. Above the stairway is a stained-glass window espousing themes of welcome. As the window stands in an alcove formed by the front and back sides of the house it has been well protected from the elements and was only removed once when Mary Moody had the stained-glass re-leaded. * Parlor - The parlor is in an 18th- century French style and is the most opulent room in the house with gold on blue-grey silk wall coverings and gold-decorated plaster friezes. Despite its grandeur, guests did not often stay in this room for long as the Moodys preferred to entertain in the less formal library. In 1983 Hurricane Alicia caused extensive water damage to this room. Ten years and ten million dollars later, this room was able to be reopened. * Library - The library is in Empire Revival style. It has pink silk wall coverings decorated with rosettes. Rosettes can also be found in the lighting fixtures and on the door and window casings. The book cases only extend halfway up the wall to invite accessibility and also to facilitate personal decoration of the room. * Ballroom - The ballroom was still unfinished upon Narcissa Willis' death. After the Moodys purchased the home, they used it as a junk room. As Mary Moody, the oldest daughter, approached her 18th birthday, Libbie Moody entreated her husband to repair the room for their daughter's debut party. William Moody, Jr. accepted bids for the room, coming in as low as $6,000. However, ever conservative with his money, decided to finish the room by himself. The flooring was pine, purchased from Sears & Roebuck. The friezes were created from molds. The only item purchased for the room was a mirror. Four years after her coming-out party, Mary Moody and Edwin Clyde Northen were married in this room. * Conservatory - Libbie Moody enjoyed growing ferns in the conservatory. During parties, musicians would play from the conservatory. * Dining Room - The dining room is in Beaux Arts style with mahogany paneling. The ceiling is coffered and quite heavy. Hidden steel railroad beams support the ceiling. The bas-relief above the fireplace depicts hunters and hounds. While it appears hand-carved it is actually painted plaster. * Pantry * Children's Dining Room - Narcissa Willis designed this room for children and grandchildren who had yet to learn proper Victorian table manners. However, Libbie Moody found the room too small, and all meals in the Moody household were taken in the dining room. * Living Room - The living room is in Colonial Revival style. =Second floor= * Libbie's Room (Infirmary Room) - This room was designed for those sick with fever, common in the 19th century. Both the airways and the fireplace of this room are separate from those of the rest of the house. This room has its own restroom. As a child Libbie Moody asked her father if she could paint the wood in her room in a lighter color because she found the dark wood too oppressive. She received her father's permission, and therefore the wood in this room is lighter than that in the others. * Mary's Room * Bathroom - This bathroom connects Mary's room with the Master Bedroom. It contains a toilet and a bidet. The tub has two fixtures for showering, one with a single spout and the other with a rainfall shower head, a feature unique to this bathroom. * Master Bedroom * Nursery Room - This room was never used as intended, but the physical features of the room allow for an understanding of its original purpose. The fireplace has small recesses on each side for warming bottles of milk, and there is a tub in this room on a raised dais of two steps that allows a nursemaid to survey the room and other potential trouble-making children while washing a baby. * William's Room * Shearn's Room * Sewing Room - This room was also used as a guest room and as a sleeping room for William Lewis Moody, Jr. during the summer months when his family was up north in Virginia.

Such conferences have been thought a likely source of some of the analytical terms now deployed in discussing interpretations, such as premillennialism/premillennarian, postmillennialism/postmillennarian and amillennialism, some time ahead of their appearance in the 1840s in print. Background The context for the initial prophetic conferences was of multiple British groups with related interests, in the 1820s. The aftermath of the French Revolution was still being felt, and for evangelicals it might suggest a premillennial return of Christ. Henry Drummond, 1857 engraving Edward Irving based his prophetic views in part on a reading of Manuel Lacunza; another possible influence was William Cuninghame of Lainshaw, more particularly in published remarks from 1817. He preached to the Continental Society and London Missionary Society in 1825, making remarks against Catholic Emancipation. He also adopted ideas of James Hatley Frere on prophetic interpretation. The Society for the Investigation of Prophecy was founded in 1826 by Frere, Irving and Lewis Way. Way was involved with the London Jews' Society, and in 1822 had written as \\"Basilicus\\" in its publication The Jewish Expositor on the Second Coming. His view on the personal reign of Christ at Jerusalem was contested by Henry Gauntlett, and a controversy resulted. Samuel Roffey Maitland, author of An Enquiry into the Grounds on which the Prophetic Period of Daniel and St. John has been supposed to consist of 1,260 Years (1826), contended against the prevailing interpretative conventions for prophecy of the 1820s. The first prophetic conference was in England in 1826, set up by Henry Drummond, who was influenced by Irving and Way. The first national prophetic conference in the USA was held in 1878. Albury Conferences (1826‚Äì1830) Albury Park, 1831 engraving Henry Drummond hosted six annual prophetic conferences at Albury Park in Surrey, England. They were chaired by Hugh McNeile, parish priest of Albury. Seven summary points included the Second Advent ahead of the Millennium, and the identification of a 1260-year period preceding the Millennium as running from the reign of Justinian I to the French Revolution. Transactions of the first three conferences were published in 1828‚Äì9 by Drummond, as Dialogues on Prophecy in three volumes. Not a faithful record of what was said, this was Drummond's version, employing pseudonyms for participants, and containing criticism of Irving. Prophetic views of James Hatley Frere were incorporated. Joshua William Brooks claimed to give a key to some of the more significant pseudonyms in his Dictionary of Writers on the Prophecies (1835); it has been said by Oliver that the value of getting behind the pseudonyms may be restricted by the heavy editorial line imposed by Drummond, and Brooks gave the caveat that participants thought themselves misrepresented.Brooks listed: Anastasius, Drummond; Aristo, Irving; Crito, Frere; Evander, John Bayford; Isocrates, McNeile; Josephus; Joseph Wolff; Philalethes, Lord Mandeville; Philemon, Charle S. Hawtrey; Sophron, William Cuninghame of Lainshaw; Thales, H. Simonds; Theodosius, William Marsh; Theophilus, James Haldane Stewart. Total participation of around 40 was dominated by Anglican clergy, but other Protestant denominations were represented, and laymen attended. From these meetings there emerged what is now known as the \\"Albury Circle\\", of like- minded persons around Drummond. It overlapped notably with the Continental Society, and in its early days with followers of Irving. By the time of the third conference of 1828, which was invitation-only, Drummond was consciously forming a select group. The views characteristic of the Albury Circle, which was heavily involved in the foundation of the Catholic Apostolic Church, were pessimistic, and tended towards separation from established churches. Seven volumes of Morning Watch, or Quarterly Journal of Prophecy and Theological Review appeared from 1829 to 1833, edited by John Tudor; it was financed by Drummond, and propagated the Circle's line, which was pre-millennial, with a stress on an imminent Second Coming of Christ and the conversion of the Jews. At the final conference of 1830, the message from the chair directed attention to the \\"spiritual gifts\\" then thought to be being manifested in West Scotland. A Morning Watch campaign, with Spencer Perceval, to continue the Apocrypha Controversy against the British and Foreign Bible Society was if anything counter-productive. James Edward Gordon was founder of the British Society for Promoting the Religious Principles of the Reformation, closely related to the Albury Circle, and also was a \\"Recordite\\", an associate of The Record edited by Alexander Haldane. Critics of the Circle included the brothers Gerard Thomas Noel and Baptist Wriothesley Noel. The former was a prophetical exegete with a closely related approach; the latter a prominent evangelical. Powerscourt Conferences (1831‚Äì1833) Powerscourt House, Wicklow, Ireland The annual conferences at the Powerscourt Estate in Ireland were significant in the genesis of the Plymouth Brethren. John Nelson Darby was influenced by the Albury Circle.

History  Jorhat (\\"jor\\" means twin and \\"hat\\" means market) means two hats or mandis- \\"Macharhat\\" and \\"Chowkihat\\" which existed on the opposite banks of the river Bhogdoi. During the 18th century, Jorhat was the last capital of the Ahom Kingdom, as a planned town under royal patronage. It is often spelt as \\"Jorehaut\\" during the British reign. In 1794, the Ahom King Gaurinath Singha shifted the capital from Sibsagar, erstwhile Rangpur to Jorhat. Many tanks were built around the capital city by the Ahom royalty such as Rajmao Pukhuri or Borpukhuri, Buragohain Pukhuri, Bolia Gohain Pukhuri, Kotoki Pukhuri and Mitha Pukhuri. This town was a flourishing and commercial metropolis but was destroyed by a series of Burmese invasions of Assam between 1817 and the arrival of the British force in 1824 under the stewardship of David Scott and Captain Richard. From the very first decade of the British rule, revolutionaries like Gomdhar Konwar, Jeuram Medhi, and Piyali Phukan emerged. The British system of administration came into vogue in the year 1839 with an established Police Thana. During the great Sepoy Mutiny, Maniram Dewan and Piyali Barua were publicly hanged here in 1858. In 1885, a narrow-gauge railway, Jorehaut Provincial Railway, became operational.

It aired on MBC from July 14 to September 9, 2007 on Saturdays and Sundays at 21:40 for 16 episodes. The romantic comedy series explores the age-old question of whether a man and a woman can ever be just friends. As the title suggests, the series makes plenty of baseball references, with each of its sixteen episodes opening with a catchy phrase relating the facts of life through the game of baseball. Plot Aspiring writer Hong Nan-hee is a foul-mouthed, disheveled and jaded single woman struggling with life and love. She and Byun Hyung-tae have been best friends for most of their lives. They cook for each other, call each other daily, bicker like siblings, and support each other when things go wrong. But everything is about to change. On her 30th birthday, Nan-hee realizes that she needs to shake things up. She begins dating Kim Jung-joo, a talented baseball pitcher who is aiming to play in the American big leagues; but Nan-hee's mother disapproves of their relationship because he is eight years younger. Tired of living with her mother, she rents Hyung-tae's house while he is on vacation, but complications arise and soon the two friends are living in the house together. As the old friends navigate new territory, they start to discover things they never knew about each other ‚Äî he's neurotic, she snores ‚Äî but more importantly, they gradually realize what their friends and family have always suspected ‚Äî that, without realizing it, they've been the most important people to each other all along.
