It is classified as a Beta Lyrae variable. Variability BX Andromedae, like all Beta Lyrae variables, shows a primary and a secondary minimum when, respectively, the most luminous and the less luminous component of the pair is eclipsed by the other. The brightness however changes smoothly, so there is no onset and an end time for the eclipses. This cycle repeats approximately every 14.6 hours. System The two stars in the system are orbiting so close to each other that they retain an ellipsoidal shape. The spectrum of the two stars hasn't been separated yet; as a whole, the system has a spectral type F2V. The physical parameters of the stars (like mass, radius, and temperature) can be inferred from the light curve. BX Andromedae, however, may be a quadruple system.

Born in Pekalongan into a family with strong santri and kyai connections, she started out as an academician before entering politics in 2001 as her home regency's vice-regent. She then became the first directly-elected regent of Pekalongan in 2006, but lost her reelection campaign in 2011. Background Siti Qomariyah was born in Pekalongan on 8 July 1967, the eldest of nine children. Her father was a local kyai and pesantren caretaker in her home village and her mother taught at kindergartens. After completing junior high school at a Pekalongan madrasa, she resumed her education in a state-funded Madrasah Aliyah (senior high school equivalent) in Jombang, East Java. After completing high school, she studied at a state Islamic institute (Institut Agama Islam Negeri) in Pekalongan. Qomariyah continued her education later on, gaining a scholarship for a master's degree at McGill University in Canada and later continued for a PhD at Gadjah Mada University. Career Prior to entering politics, Qomariyah lectured at a state-funded Islamic institute (Sekolah Tinggi Agama Islam Negeri) in Pekalongan since 1992. 2001 and 2006 local election In 2001, she ran as the running mate of PDI-P politician Amat Antono as regent and vice-regent of Pekalongan. While initially uninterested in politics, Qomariyah was invited to the position by the National Awakening Party. The election, which was an indirect vote by the regency's legislative council, required two phases to resolve as Antono/Qomariyah could not secure an initial majority. After a 27-18 vote, Qomariyah became the vice regent of Pekalongan. She ran again in 2006, still with PKB and NU support, in Pekalongan's first direct regency election. This time she ran as the regent candidate, against Antono who ran for reelection. During the election, she was charged with a sexual scandal, with images allegedly depicting her with her running mate Pontjo Nugroho circulating online. She eventually won the election, receiving 227,137 votes while Antono received 207,705. Once she was elected and sworn in, demonstrations demanding her removal from office due to the images were held. As regent As regent, Qomariyah put significant attention into female representation and issues, although she did not include it in the regency's five-year plans, and women still suffered from less education and gender pay gap. She also initiated the construction of a new building for her alumni IAIN Pekalongan, which was completed in 2018. She ran for reelection in the 2011 local election. In a four-way race that included herself, her deputy Pontjo Nugroho, Amat Antono, and Imam Djamhuri, she placed second, with 166,210 votes to Antono's 254,762. Following the end of her term, she resumed her lecturing at STAIN Pekalongan.

Her work helped to broaden maternal nursing to include caring for the mother's mental wellbeing before and after childbirth.  Career  Rubin received her bachelor's degree from Hunter College in 1941, and received her master's degree in nursing from Yale University in 1946. Rubin then started work with the Frontier Nursing Service. She worked with them as a midwife in impoverished parts of rural Kentucky before returning to Yale to complete her master's in mental health, which she received in 1954. She taught at the Yale School of Nursing and the University of Chicago before joining the faculty at the University of Pittsburgh, where she taught from 1960 to 1981. Throughout her time teaching, she published articles on maternity and maternity nursing. Her published work of the 1960s broadened maternity nursing in theory and practice; whereas maternity nursing had focused previously on biology and physiology, Rubin's work brought the mental work of the mother into the conversation. In particular, Rubin differentiated maternal nursing from obstetric nursing. She argued that obstetric nurses' role only included helping the physician in the delivery of the child, whereas maternal nurses assisted the new mother in transitioning into her role as a mother. She published writings from 1961 onwards, culminating in her 1984 book published \\"The Maternal Identity and the Maternal Experience.\\" Her early writings described the mental work of assuming motherhood as an identity and of connecting with a child. She also published work on mother-child relationships which spanned food and feeding, pregnancy, self-esteem and mental wellbeing. In 1972, she and Florence H. Erickson founded the first known research journal in the field of maternal nursing, Maternal Child Care Nursing Journal. They worked together at the University of Pittsburgh and established the university's first master's and doctoral degrees in nursing. In a 1988 review of her published work and contributions to maternity nursing, the authors concluded that advances in technology and shifts in medical and nursing practice and to hospital policy had made some of her psychosocial theories irrelevant to the mothers of 1988. For example, they noted that Rubin's analysis of a mother's cognitive state during pregnancy, centered around the uncertainty of her child's sex, had become less relevant since the introduction of ultrasound imaging.  Awards  The March of Dimes awarded Rubin their first annual Award in Nursing. In 1976 she received the Distinguished Service Award in Maternal-Child Nursing from the American Nurses Association. In 1992, she received an honorary doctorate from the University of Calgary.

History TAMWA was founded in 1987, part of a new generation of women's rights organizations in Africa established around the time of the 1985 World Conference on Women in Nairobi, distinguished by their autonomy from national governments. In Tanzania, these groups included Women Research and Documentation Project, at the University of Dar es Salaam, the Women Advancement Trust (WAT), and the Tanzania Gender Networking Programme. TAMWA was founded by a group of female journalists who had previously worked, beginning in 1979, to bring women's issues into the forefront through radio broadcasts on a variety of topics, including pregnancy among school girls, violence against women, and other local issues. After dispersing, they came back together in 1986 to form a formal association. The inspiration for the group came from the journalist Fatma Alloo, who witnessed the formation of Uganda Media Women Organization (UMWA) while working as a journalist in Uganda. Initially, the organization's goals were to encourage more opportunities for female journalists, and to address gender discrimination in newsrooms across Tanzania. However, during the process of writing a constitution, the organization's goals broadened to focus on educating women on their rights and advocating for the rights of women nationwide. The organization was registered on November 17, 1987. The organization's first Chairperson was Fatma Alloo, while Halima Shariff served as the first Secretary General. Some of the organization's early efforts included printing a monthly newsletter entitled Sauti ya Siti, named after Siti Binti Saad (Saad also means \\"woman\\" in Kiswahili). The goal of Sauti ya Siti was to provide a voice for Tanzanian women to be heard by public stakeholders and to bring women's concerns to the forefront. Starting in March, 1988, it went on to publish 39 issues by 2016, and it received funds from the Canadian Organization for Development to cover printing costs for Sauti ya Siti. They also produced a booklet in Kiswahili to explain how to register NGOs so as to allow more people to create organizations beneficial to the Tanzanian public. In 1997, TAMWA worked with FemAct to hold a symposium on gender violence for members of the Tanzanian Parliament in Dodoma. In recent years, TAMWA has used what they call \\"Bang style journalism\\" to air these concerns publicly. This includes educational materials in newspapers, on billboards, calendars, and posters, as well as through radio and television segments. From 2003 to 2007, 50,000 posters were produced per year carrying a variety of messages, including about women and leadership, Female Genital Mutilation, and sexual violence. TAMWA's members are required to have a Diploma in journalism. As of 2012, the organization had over 100 journalists working in electronic and print media. The organization holds an annual General Meeting of all its members each March to make decisions about the organization's future. From 2009-2014, the organization focused on five major strategic issues: 1) Gender Based Violence, 2) Good Governance, 3) Gender equality, 4) Poverty, and 5) Health. TAMWA also worked extensively to include important aspects of women's issues into the writing of the 2014 Tanzanian Constitution. Issues and activities  TAMWA has been active in encouraging women to run for the National Assembly of Tanzania and pressing political parties to nominate more women candidates. These efforts were cited in Africa Today as contributing to significant increases in the number of women candidates for the Assembly in 1995 and 2005. Efforts were directed towards producing published material to explain the problems with domestic violence, GBV, Female genital mutilation and other harmful practices. TAMWA also founded a Crisis Center in Dar es Salaam in 1990 to provide aid and assistance to those who suffered from domestic violence. In 2003, the center received 787 clients, and it was funded by the Southern African AIDS Training Program (SAT). This center eventually evolved into an independent organization (the Crisis Resolving Center) in 2007. In response to increasing problems with sanitation in primary schools, TAMWA took efforts to expand their coverage and advocacy for health to include hygiene as well. In 2000, TAMWA launched a Breast & Cervical Cancer awareness campaign.

Stowers Furniture Company and George Arthur Stowers, who developed the property for its retail store in 1913 at the corner of Fannin and Walker streets in downtown Houston. The architecture firm of Green & Finger composed its structure from reinforced concrete, clad the building in white brick, and capped it with a pressed metal cornice. Drawing some of its inspiration from the Chicago style, the facades are rectangular, with pilasters defining vertical bay structures, with seven of these vertical modules facing south and five modules facing east to the Fannin side. The partners of the architecture firm were Lewis Sterling Green and Joseph Finger. During their two years of working together, they designed three buildings in Houston, most notably the De George Hotel.“NRHP form,” p. 11. George Arthur Stowers (1867–1917) was born in Richmond County, Georgia on February 3, 1867. His family moved to Atlanta, where he attended school and worked. He worked there as a Western Union messenger, sold newspapers for the Atlanta Constitution, and worked for a confectioner. He entered the furniture retail business in Birmingham, Alabama at the age of seventeen with his own capital. He added locations in Alabama, while expanding to Tennessee and Texas. Later he established a permanent headquarters in San Antonio, Texas and started his first store in Houston, on Main Street, at the beginning of the 20th century. Their store on the 700 block of Main was consumed by fire, which led them to commission the Stowers Building.“NRHP form,” p. 10. Gordon's Jewelers acquired Stowers Furniture Company in 1966. The new owners moved the furniture store to far west Houston and moved their jewelry operations into the Stowers Building. The Stowers building represents a period of early skyscraper development in Houston from 1909 to 1913. It was one of eight buildings of at least nine stories built during this period in downtown Houston, five of which are extant NHRP properties: the Scanlan Building (1909), the Carter Building (1910), the Southern Pacific Office Building (1911), Union National Bank (1912), and the Rice Hotel (1913).\\"NRHP Form,\\" pp. 1112. Hotel As of 2016, the Stowers Building was under the ownership and management of Trend Hospitality, a hotel operator with an agreement to brand the facility with Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, a division of Marriott International. It named the Hotel Aloft, one of two in Houston. The redevelopment of building as a hotel coincided with a large expansion of lodging capacity and the redevelopment of other historic properties in preparation for the 2017 Super Bowl. The hotel opened in October 2016 with 168 large rooms.

She is the author of six novels, including the bestselling Longbourn, a New York Times Notable Book, in development as a feature film with Random House Films and Studio Canal. She has also written short stories for BBC Radio 4 and reviews for The Guardian and The New York Times Book Review. In 2018 she was awarded a Visiting Fellowship at the Queen’s University, Belfast, and she is currently an Honorary Fellow at Lancaster University.  Early life and education  Baker was born and grew up in the village of Arkholme, in Lancashire, England. She was educated at Queen Elizabeth School, Kirkby Lonsdale, and Somerville College, Oxford. She moved to Belfast in 1995 to study for an MA in Irish literature at Queen's University, where she went on to complete a PhD on the Anglo-Irish novelist Elizabeth Bowen.  Novels  * Offcomer (2002). Baker’s debut novel is set in Belfast in the wake of the Good Friday Agreement, and follows the life of Claire Thomas, a young woman from the North of England. The TLS called it “Quietly yet powerfully moving.” * The Mermaid’s Child (2005). A fantastical story of a young girl on a journey across oceans and continents in search of her mother. San Francisco Book Review said: “Malin’s world is both darker and brighter than our own world, more disturbing and more enthralling, more frightening and more beautiful. This is a novel worth getting lost in.” * The Telling (2008). A modern-day ghost story told through the eyes of a woman settling her recently deceased mother’s affairs. The Daily Telegraph commented: “What Jo Baker has done, with remarkable dexterity, is to make this ghost story intensely intimate; it is a haunting that is all about the struggle to communicate.” * The Picture Book (published in the US as The Undertow) (2011). Set against the rolling backdrop of a century of British history, from the First World War to the “War on Terror”, this is a family portrait captured in snapshots. The Financial Times said of it: “Jo Baker is a novelist with a gift for intimate and atmospheric storytelling… Baker skilfully delineates the currents of social change and the essential human drama that persists: the intertwining of love and grief… The result is an agile, keenly observed novel.” * Longbourn (2013). Baker’s bestselling novel revisits the events of Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, told from the point of view of the servants in the Bennet household. In an interview with BookBrowse, Baker stated that she first read Pride and Prejudice as a child and that her own novel was inspired in part by the fact that her ancestors had been in service. The Daily Express said: “This clever glimpse of Austen's universe through a window clouded by washday steam is so compelling it leaves you wanting to read the next chapter in the lives below stairs.” It was selected by The New York Times as one of its 100 Notable Books of 2013, describing it as “a work that’s both original and charming, even gripping, in its own right”. Longbourn has been translated into twenty-one languages, and was shortlisted for the IBW Book Award. * A Country Road, A Tree (2016). A fictionalised account of Samuel Beckett’s real-life involvement with the French Resistance during the Second World War. The Guardian stated: “It is a daring project, to enter the mind of a man known for his withdrawal and silences, but Baker succeeds triumphantly in prose that is both intimate and austere, with an unobtrusive Beckettian cadence.” In an interview with Foyles, she described the process of writing about literary greats such as Beckett and Marcel Duchamp as “really scary”, but “utterly irresistible”. A Country Road, A Tree was shortlisted for the American Library in Paris Book Award, The James Tait Black Memorial Prize and the Sir Walter Scott Prize for Historical Fiction. * The Body Lies (2019). Baker’s seventh novel is described as \\"literary suspense with multiple voices and testimonies\\" that looks at male violence in fiction and in life. Jane Lawson of Doubleday said: “Jo Baker is a literary chameleon. This novel is utterly compelling.” It is published by Doubleday in the UK, and in the USA by Knopf in June 2019.  Longbourn adaptations  * Film: a cinematic adaptation of Longbourn is due to start filming, directed by Sharon Maguire, who also directed Bridget Jones's Diary and Bridget Jones's Baby, screenplay by Jessica Swale, produced by Random House Films and StudioCanal. * Radio: the novel was also adapted for radio, appearing on BBC Radio 4’s Book at Bedtime, abridged by Sara Davies and read by Sophie Thompson. It was first broadcast in May 2014; and again on Radio 4 Extra in September 2018.  Personal life  Baker lives in Lancaster with her husband, the playwright and screenwriter Daragh Carville, and their two children.

This agreement's most controversial element was a move towards episcopacy, having a bishopric with full apostolic succession. The founders of the Augsburg Lutheran Churches believed that the Augsburg Confession (1530), considered the founding document of Lutheranism, holds that ordination is not a sacrament, but a human ceremony. Thus its observance need not be uniform across the church. In 2003, the Augsburg Lutheran District reorganized as a separate denomination and adopted its present name, the Augsburg Lutheran Churches. The Augsburg Lutheran Churches works together with the Lutheran Congregations in Mission for Christ, and some of its congregations have joint membership in both bodies. It also enjoys a cordial relationship with the North American Lutheran Church. Its official seminary is the Institute of Lutheran Theology.

It is generally distinguished from metastasis, which is the spread of cancer cells through the circulatory system or the lymphatic system to more distant locations. Yet, lymphovascular invasion is generally the first step of metastasis. Introduction Numerous studies have confirmed the existence of two main patterns of cancer cell invasion by cell migration: collective cell migration and individual cell migration, by which tumor cells overcome barriers of the extracellular matrix and spread into surrounding tissues. Each pattern of cell migration displays specific morphological features and the biochemical/molecular genetic mechanisms underlying cell migration. Two types of migrating tumor cells, mesenchymal (fibroblast-like) and amoeboid, are observed in each pattern of cancer cell invasion. This review describes the key differences between the variants of cancer cell migration, the role of epithelial-mesenchymal, collective-amoeboid, mesenchymal-amoeboid, and amoeboid- mesenchymal transitions, as well as the significance of different tumor factors and stromal molecules in tumor invasion. The data and facts collected are essential to the understanding of how the patterns of cancer cell invasion are related to cancer progression and therapy efficacy. Convincing evidence is provided that morphological manifestations of the invasion patterns are characterized by a variety of tissue (tumor) structures. The results of our own studies are presented to show the association of breast cancer progression with intratumoral morphological heterogeneity, which most likely reflects the types of cancer cell migration and results from different activities of cell adhesion molecules in tumor cells of distinct morphological structures. (Creative Commons Attribution License) Invasive growth and metastasis as manifestation of cancer malignancy The results of numerous experimental and clinical studies of malignant neoplasms have indicated that invasive growth and metastasis are the main manifestations of tumor progression, which represent two closely related processes. A malignant tumor is characterized by the possibility to implement such a biological phenomenon as the metastatic cascade that is a unique multi-stage “program” where cell invasion is a trigger and a key factor for further cancer progression and metastasis in distant organs and tissues. Massive metastatic lesions lead to the development of severe organ failure and, therefore, a patient’s death. The range between “end” points of a complex invasive metastatic process –invasion of the primary tumor into surrounding tissues and the formation of metastatic foci –comprises several stages, the passage of which is strictly necessary for the successful development and subsequent progression of tumor growth: intravasation, survival and presence in the systemic circulation, extravasation with subsequent colonization of organs by tumor cells, and the formation of clinically detectable metastasis. Tumor growth is accompanied by increasing pressure on extracellular matrix structures, whereas the tissue microenvironment fights to retain its functional-anatomic integrity via increasing pressure on tumor cells. The factors limiting the growth of malignant neoplasm include the basal membrane and various components of the surrounding stroma, increased interstitial pressure, limited oxygen supply to tumor cells and the formation of active oxygen forms, hypoxia conditions, and permanent exposure to immune system cells. Given the intratumoral heterogeneity, in the struggle for survival, some tumor cells may be subjected to regression and death, while other cells, which resist powerful, counteracting microen vironmental factors, gain an aggressive phenotype and the ability of metastatic progression . Invasive tumor growth is enabled by the detachment of malignant cells from the tumor mass due to a reduction in or complete loss of intercellular adhesion molecules, and, therefore, the cells gain the ability of anomalously high motility enabling penetration through the stiff structural elements of the surrounding stroma . In this case, the invasion process extensively involves various molecular and cellular mechanisms that, according to published data, depend directly on another biological phenomenon – the epithelial-mesenchymal transformation, which was first described by E.D. Hay in 1995. Later, the term “epithelial-mesenchymal transition” (EMT) was put to use to clarify the reversibility of this process . Currently, EMT is known to underlie the processes of embryogenesis and inflammation and regeneration of tissues and, certainly, plays a key role in the mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Physiological prototypes of invasive growth Tumor cells spreading into the surrounding tissues and distant organs are known to reproduce the mechanisms and migration types characteristic of normal, non-tumor cells during physiological processes. Tumor cells, similar to normal cells, are capable of activating these mechanisms for changing their own shape, creating conditions for moving, as well as remodeling surrounding tissues to form migration pathways. The main problem is that tumor cells, in contrast to normal cells, do not have physiological “stop signals” to terminate these processes. Most likely, this leads to the establishment of the migration mechanisms and promotes the progression and spread of the tumor. Malignant cells were found to use built-in genetic programs to implement the processes that determine invasive growth and the possibility of metastasis. For example, the movement of a single cell is observed during embryonic development and inflammation (e.g., leukocyte migration). A similar mechanism of dissemination is typical of cancer cells during tumor progression and metastasis. Along with single cell migration, collective cell migration can occur when groups of firmly interconnected tumor cells are migrating. This type of migration indicates tissue rearrangement, underlies the processes of embryonic morphogenesis, and also is an essential component in the healing of wound surfaces. Therefore, the key is that malignant tumor cells extensively use the mechanisms of both collective and single cell migration as physiological prototypes in the process of invasive growth and metastasis. Patterns of invasive growth At present, based on a complex of certain morphological and molecular genetic parameters, two fundamentally different patterns of invasive growth are distinguished: collective (group) cell migration and single cell migration (individual migration: Fig. 1). In this case, the migration type is largely determined by tissue microenvironment features and depends on molecular changes in tumor cells. Patterns of cancer cell invasion: collective cell and individual cell migration. In collective cell migration, tumor cells exhibit high expression of E-cadherin and integrins. Epithelial-mesenchymal (EMT) and collective-amoeboid (CAT) transitions are a trigger between collective cell invasion and individual cell migration. EMT involves activation of transcription factors, such as TWIST1, Snail, Slug, ZEB1/2, a decrease in E-cadherin expression, and an increase in protease activity. During EMT, tumor cells acquire the mesenchymal phenotype, detach from the tumor mass, and migrate by the mesenchymal mechanism. In contrast, the partial EMT that is specific to the tumor invasive front means that tumor cells retain cell-cell adhesion but already possess migratory ability. This tumor cell phenotype was named the “epithelial-mesenchymal” phenotype. In CAT, which takes place when β1 integrins are down-regulated, tumor cells detach from the tumor mass and move by the amoeboid mechanism. Amoeboid migration involves a decrease in protease and integrin expression and changes in the activity of GTPases – inhibition of Rac1 and activation of RhoA. This movement type occurs in the loose/soft extracellular matrix. In contrast, mesenchymal migration is associated with the opposite phenotype and predominates in the dense/stiff matrix. These two movement types are highly plastic and can convert to each other, depending on the extracellular matrix type and intracellular regulation. Thereby, the mesenchymal-amoeboid (MAT) and amoeboid-mesenchymal (AMT) transitions are suggested. Determination of the invasion mechanism used by single migrating cells during migration is a complex task. Unfortunately, studies examining this issue at the molecular and morphological levels are few in numbers and mostly were carried out in vitro using specific cell lines. However, now, there is considerable increase in the number of studies that demonstrate increasing interest in research into the molecular genetic features of tumor cells that determine the main differences between the mesenchymal and amoeboid types of cell movement during individual migration, as well as collective migration. Collective migration Collective migration is characterized by the migration of whole groups of cells interconnected by adhesion molecules and other communication junctions (Fig. 1). This is the main feature of this type of invasion, since the underlying cellular mechanisms are the same key processes that largely determine single cell migration. Collective cell migration has been observed in the development and progression of breast and endometrial cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, largecell lung carcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, melanoma, as well as most squamous cell carcinomas. In the case of collective migration, cancer cells, being a part of the tumor mass or detaching from it in the form of multicellular groups, penetrate into the surrounding tissues and form thin short chords, clusters, stripes and wide fields, as well as structures with lumen, that indicate a wide variety of structural elements involved in tumor invasion. As already mentioned, collective migration is characterized by the migration of whole cell groups interconnected by cadherins and intercellular gap junctions. A moving cell group has a “leading edge” or “leading front” that uses integrins and proteases (Fig. 1). Researchers indicate clear differences in the expression of genes and the morphology between the “leader” cells forming the leading edge and the “follower” cells that are located behind them, at the “trailing edge.” The “leaders” in the cell shape often resemble mesenchymal cells and are characterized by a less pronounced ordering and structural organization, while the “followers” tend to form more tightly packed, rosette-like tubular structures with tight intercellular contacts. In the case of collective migration, tumor cells form protrusions (pseudopodia) at the leading edge, use integrins to form focal contacts with the actin cytoskeleton, and perform proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix, creating a space for invasion of the tumor tissue and extensively involving the actin-myosin contractile apparatus in the process to ensure successful migration. The differences in the polarity of collectively migrating cell groups are due to the features of expression of surface receptors, such as CXCR4 and CXCR7 chemokine receptors, in the “leader” cells. The growth factors and chemokines produced by stromal cells and a diffusion gradient provide extracellular induction of cell polarization. Involvement of chemokines, such as SDF1 (CXCL12), the fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), in these processes has been under discussion. Much is known about the involvement of TGF-β in carcinogenesis, with its role being twofold. Taylor et al. have drawn attention to the fact that TGF-β, which acts in the epithelial cells of the mammary gland as a potent tumor suppressor at the early stages of cancer, can affect tumor development via interaction with oncogenic cytokines. Increased expression of TGF-β has been associated with the progression of tumor, which has often been observed, e.g., at the later stages of breast cancer. The role of TGF-β in epithelial-stromal migration during tumor progression has not been studied sufficiently. TGF-β is supposed to be a key regulator of the interactions between the tumor and stroma, which promotes collective cell migration in breast cancer. It has been established that leader cells express podoplanin, a transmembrane glycoprotein that is expressed under normal conditions in kidney podocytes, type 1 lung alveolar cells, skeletal muscle cells, placenta, etc. Podoplanin expression in breast cancer cells induces cell migration and invasion with the formation of filopodia and simultaneous retention of Ecadherin expression. Data have been reported indicating that collectively migrating cancer cells can use the ability of adjacent mesenchymal cells to modify the structure of the matrix and rebuild it, and then follow in their “footsteps.” In in vitro experiments, the introduction of fibroblasts in the culture induces collective tumor cell migration to the underlying matrix in the form of chains. Therefore, fibroblasts are a “guide” for invading tumor cells, remodeling the surrounding extracellular matrix to pathways with thick collagen bundles on the sides and a lack of a matrix in the center. LIM-kinase, a member of one of the protein families, plays a role in the development of collective migration by tumor cells. This protein is known to be involved in the regulation of developing invadopodias, which are structures typical of malignant tumor cells and responsible for the destruction of the surrounding extracellular matrix. Excessive activation of LIM-kinase is displayed in breast cancer. Breast tumor cells with suppressed expression of the LIM-kinase gene lose their ability to invade due to the loss of their ability to disrupt the extracellular matrix. Single cell invasion or individual cell migration Such a type of invasive growth as single cell invasion is distinguished based on the detection, during morphological analysis, of individual tumor cells that invade the surrounding tissues independently of each other. In this type of tumor invasion, single cell migration can occur via two different movement types: mesenchymal and amoeboid. A number of researchers point to the possibility of a “shift” from one type of migration to the other (from mesenchymal to amoeboid and vice versa, Fig. 1) in the case of single cell invasion. These transitions usually occur upon changes in the activity of certain cell molecules when tumor cells have to adapt to the peculiarities of the microenvironment. Mesenchymal (fibroblast-like) cell migration The mesenchymal mechanisms of invasive cell growth, in contrast to the amoeboid type of migration, are characterized by the occurrence of more complex processes and a need for the involvement of a larger number of cellular molecules in its implementation (Fig. 1). This type of migration is typical of keratinocytes during reparative regeneration, endotheliocytes, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts. Since malignant cells, which use the mesenchymal type of movement, lose epithelial polarity and gain an elongated spindle shape, which resembles the fibroblast shape, invasion of this type is also called “fibroblast-like” migration. Mesenchymal invasion has been detected during the development of melanoma, fibrosarcoma, glioblastoma, and other malignancies. Most of the cancer cells that detach from the tumor mass and invade the surrounding tissues are known to undergo certain changes, acquiring the morphological properties and a phenotype typical of mesenchymal cells. This transformation of a malignant epithelial cell, which is related to the emergence of new molecular and morphological features in the cell, was called the “epithelial- mesenchymal transition.” As already mentioned, this biological phenomenon was first described by E.D. Hay in 1995. Today, the existence of the phenomenon is supported by the results of a large number of studies that have investigated the mechanisms of invasion and metastasis of malignant tumors. The mesenchymal mechanism of invasion is believed to be the consequence of EMT, when active dedifferentiation of a malignant epithelial tumor occurs, and multicellular groups start to divide into single tumor cells, gaining a mesenchymal phenotype. A number of researchers have stressed that tumor cells during the mesenchymal type of migration go through a number of specific sequential steps that constitute a five-stage model of migration. This cycle includes the following changes: 1) formation of a protrusion on one of the cell poles – a lamellipodia or a filopodia produced by contractions of the actin cytoskeleton under the control of small GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 with rapid involvement of integrins of the β1 family; 2) occurrence of focal adhesion with the involvement of integrins β1 and β3 at the contact site between the extracellular matrix and the cell; 3) assembly of focal contacts, which is based on integrin-mediated interactions, and activation of proteolytic enzymes (matrix metalloproteinases, serine and threonine proteases, cathepsins) at the “cell-matrix” interface that leads to the destruction and remodeling of the surrounding extracellular matrix; 4) a change in the actin cytoskeleton polarization under myosin II-mediated control, the occurrence of cell body contractions; and 5) “pulling” the trailing edge toward movement through the newly formed defects in the matrix structure. Since the cells which use the fibroblast-like mechanism of invasion follow the described migration steps, their speed of movement is low: about 0.1– μm/min. The possibility of proteolysis and remodeling of tissue structures explains the fact that mesenchymal movement of a tumor cell is accompanied by minor changes, compared to amoeboid migration, in the cell’s shape and by minimal deformation of the nucleus. Of clear interest are the results of studies that indicate that the behavior of tumor cells during individual migration depends on the surrounding matrix’ stiffness. For example, the mesenchymal or proteolytic model of migration dominates under conditions of a “stiff” (“dense”) surrounding matrix. The high migration efficiency of a single cell using the mesenchymal mechanism in dense tissues is explained by proteolysis due to the secretion of various proteases and by the ability to form focal contacts with stromal elements. Therefore, it is worth noting that the key points of the fibroblast-like mechanism of invasive growth are strong adhesion forces on both poles of the cell as well as between cells and extracellular matrix components, pronounced expression of integrins (β1 and β3 families), proteolysis with destruction and subsequent remodeling of tissues with the formation of defects in the matrix structure, and movement of a single cell or cell chains through the defects. The nucleus deformation is minimal, and a slow rate of cell migration is observed. Based on the suppression of the expression of the relevant genes using small interfering RNAs, the specific activity of GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 was demonstrated to be the characteristic feature of the mesenchymal type of invasion. Suppression of GTPase Rac1 through signaling activation of GTPase RhoA and its effector, ROCK kinase, leads to blockage of the mesenchymal migration of tumor cells. Amoeboid cell migration The amoeboid mechanism of invasive growth is the most primitive and, at the same time, the most efficient mode of migration of single tumor cells. In all of its features, it is similar to the behavior and movement of a single-celled organism, such as the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. The use of antibodies that block integrins or protease inhibitors in clinical trials leads to the emergence of tumor cells with the amoeboid type of migration. Similar results were obtained in studies of malignant tumors in vivo. A relationship between the application of drugs on the basis of matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors in cancer therapy and progression of the tumor process was established. The explanation of this relationship became possible only after the identification of tumor cells capable of amoeboid migration. These data most likely indicate that, under conditions of a reduction in or complete loss of their ability to spread to the surrounding tissues using the main molecules that perform adhesion and destruction of the extracellular matrix, tumor cells turn to the amoeboid mechanism of invasion, which becomes the only and most effective mode of migration. This type of migration has been described in circulating stem cells, leukocytes, and certain types of tumor cells. According to Zijl et al., the amoeboid type of invasive growth has been observed in breast cancer, lymphoma, small cell lung cancer and prostate cancer, and melanoma. In the case of amoeboid migration, malignant tumor cells have been demonstrated to have a round or elliptical shape (Fig. 1). Amoeboid cells are characterized by fast deformability, adaption of their shapes to existing structures of the surrounding extracellular matrix, and penetration through them via narrow spaces in a compressed form. Movement and relocation are carried out through successive high-speed cycles of expansion and contraction of the cell’s body with the development of “bleb-like” protrusions of the cell membrane. These blebs allow the cell to investigate the microenvironment to find the most suitable route of movement to bypass various obstacles, whereby tumor cells are capable of moving through narrow gaps in the extracellular matrix. Developing changes in the cell shape are generated by the cortical actin cytoskeleton that is, in turn, controlled by small GTPase RhoA and its effector, ROCK kinase. This GTPase belongs to the superfamily of small GTP hydrolases, whose members play key roles in the amoeboid type of invasion, since they are involved in signal transduction and, thereby, in the regulation of a wide variety of processes occurring in the cell, including reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton during migration. It is worth noting that migration through the amoeboid mechanism of invasion is accompanied by changes not only in the cell shape, but also in the shape of the nucleus and its orientation and position relative to other internal organelles. The nucleus, which is the largest and stiffer, compared to the surrounding cytoskeleton, organelle, is mechanically firmly stabilized by an extensive network of structural proteins, and, for this reason, its shape, most likely, often does not undergo significant changes. However, the amoeboid type of migration is characterized by the most pronounced nucleus deformation, caused by the lack of proteolytic degradation of the surrounding matrix. Since tumor cells have to move through narrow spaces and pores, the nucleus in this case also occurs in a maximum compressed state. It is assumed that, like the amoeboid movement of leukocytes, nuclei inside single migrating tumor cells move forward toward the leading edge. In contrast to the mesenchymal movement, amoeboid or a non-proteolytic model of migration prevails when the surrounding matrix is characterized by relatively low stiffness (“soft” matrix). For example, amoeboid migration of tumor cells in the lymphatic and circulatory systems is considered as migration in a soft matrix. Condeelis and Segall elucidated some features of cell migration on the example of two different tumor lines, MTC and MTLn3, under in vitro and in vivo conditions. MTLn3 cells that have a high metastatic potential and migrate probably by the amoeboid mechanism of invasive growth are characterized by a higher level of expression of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) than MTC cells with a low metastatic potential. Their migration is associated with the presence of blood vessels and collagen-containing fibers in the surrounding matrix. Tumor cell chemotaxis towards blood vessels is believed to be mediated by the signaling pathways of EGFR. The amoeboid mechanism of invasion has a number of distinctive features. It is characterized by a weak interaction between cells and the surrounding matrix, as well as a lack of or weak focal contacts. The possibility to retain the rapid and non-focal assembly of receptors at the sites of cell contacts with the extracellular substrate has been noted. Integrins are not important in this type of invasive growth. Important aspects are the absence of proteolysis at the sites of cell- matrix interactions and the lack of expression of proteolytic enzymes that destroy the extracellular matrix. In vitro studies have demonstrated that, in the case of an amoeboid type of invasive growth, it is likely due to these properties that tumor cells are capable of moving at the highest speed in cultures (20 μm/min). Amoeboid-mesenchymal and mesenchymal-amoeboid transitions We have already noted the existence of a degree of plasticity and the possibility of a “shift” from one migration type to the other (from the mesenchymal type to the amoeboid one and vice versa) upon individual cell invasion. These events are apparently due to the appearance of changes in the activity of certain cell molecules and the need to adapt to tissue microenvironment conditions (Fig. 1). These changes are described as amoeboid- mesenchymal and mesenchymal-amoeboid transitions. Tumor cells using the mesenchymal type of migration can be changed in a certain way and shift to the amoeboid type of movement under conditions of a weakened signal and mechanical pathways that are directly involved in the stabilization of the interactions between extracellular matrix structures and malignant cells. However, the available data were obtained primarily by means of experiments. The following mechanisms leading to the transition of cells from the mesenchymal to the amoeboid type of invasive growth (mesenchymal-amoeboid transition) have been described: 1) reduction in or complete abolition of pericellular proteolysis due to application of protease inhibitors; 2) reduction in the activity of integrin receptors and their interactions with surrounding stromal elements by their antagonists; 3) increase in and stabilization of the activity of small GTPase RhoA and its ROCK effector. A study by S. Berton’s group provided an interesting fact indicating that the p27 protein, despite a great variety of functions, plays an important role in the control of cell motility. In particular, a lack of this protein under in vitro conditions induces the mesenchymal-amoeboid transition in cells in a 3D matrix. Some authors studying the mechanisms of invasive growth upon individual cell migration indicate the possibility of an amoeboid-mesenchymal transition that is the reverse process to the mesenchymalamoeboid transition. There is a hypothesis according to which the mechanism of amoeboid-mesenchymal transition most likely relies on the same molecular basis, and that the only reliable process that determines the possibility of the described transformation is an imbalance in the activity of members of the small GTPase family and predominance of the Rac activity over the RhoA activity. The mechanisms that could underlie the described changes remain unclear. Collective-individual transitions Tumor cells within a single tumor can simultaneously move both collectively and individually. In this case, the transition from individual to collective migration is an important step towards increasing the invasive and metastatic potential of malignant neoplasms. For example, breast tumor cells detached from the solid mass gain the ability to invade lymphatic vessels. Currently, two mechanisms are distinguished: epithelial-mesenchymal and collective- amoeboid transitions by which individually migrating tumor cells are produced (Fig. 1). In turn, the latter, in particular cells that have undergone EMT, are capable under certain conditions of gaining an epithelial phenotype and forming tumor multicellular complexes. This phenotype inversion was called the “mesenchymal-epithelial transition”. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition Lately, there has been vigorous discussion of the epithelial- mesenchymal transition as a mechanism during which the tumor cell detaches from the epithelial layer and gains motility (Fig. 1), the so-called “locomotor phenotype,” which promotes invasive growth and metastasis. The development of this process as a key factor of cancer progression was shown in vitro using specific tumor lines as well as experimental models; however, establishment of the EMT development and identification of tumor cells and their main characteristics under in vivo conditions is a complex task. EMT is the basis of many processes of morphogenesis. It is believed that under normal conditions (during embryogenesis) EMT can be induced by the HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) secreted by fibroblasts. HGF binds to specific c-Met receptors located on the membrane of epithelial cells. The binding to receptors activates a signaling pathway involving some proteins of the small GTPase system (Cdc42, Rac, RhoA, RhoC) that regulate the intensity of actin microfilament polymerization and the contractility of actin-myosin filaments, which determines the intensity of lamellipodia formation and tension of the matrix-attached cell. In this case, there is significant rearrangement of the whole actin-myosin cytoskeleton and loss of E-cadherin intercellular contacts. During carcinogenesis, epithelial cells are subjected to a morphological transformation that is phenotypically similar to EMT but develops in the absence of the relevant HGF ligand. This transformation in malignant tumors can be induced by transfection of various oncogenes. During transformation, tumor cells can leave the epithelial layer and move like fibroblasts, thereby gaining the ability of invasion and metastasis. During EMT, the following major events occur: malignant epithelial cells lose their apical-basal polarity due to disruption in tight intercellular junctions and loss of cellular adhesion molecules (such as E-cadherin and integrins); the cellular actin cytoskeleton is changed and subjected to remodeling with the formation of stress fibers that are collected in certain cell parts near the cell membrane, where specific cellular protrusions begin subsequently to form; degradation of the underlying basal membrane of the epithelium occurs, which results in the fact that tumor cells lacking intercellular contacts become capable of invasive growth and penetration into the surrounding stromal matrix and begin active migration. EMT was found to be rarely equally pronounced in the entire tumor tissue. More likely, this process is characterized by a varying intensity of the transition of cells from the epithelial to the mesenchymal phenotype. In this regard, some researchers describe the so-called partial EMT, in which most cells in the invasive front are involved (Fig. 1). Partial EMT is a state when cells have already gained the properties necessary for successful migration, but continue to retain cell-cell contacts. This phenotype was called the hybrid “epithelial- mesenchymal” phenotype and was linked to the features characteristic of collectively moving tumor cells. Taddei et al. have indicated that EMT develops due to the induction of programs associated with the activation of key transcription factors, such as TWIST1, Snail, Slug, and ZEB1/2. This results in disruption in strong cadherin junctions and activation of polar cell migration and proteolysis of extracellular matrix components by various secreted proteases, with the functions of integrin receptors being retained. The role of the transcription factor Prrx1, which determines the ability of breast cancer cells for invasive growth, was experimentally established. It was shown that ZEB1 and ZEB2 proteins with a zinc finger domain are able to directly bind to promoters, thereby inducing the expression of mesenchymal marker genes and suppressing the expression of E-cadherin and other epithelial markers. Similarly, Snail and Slug are able to suppress the expression of the E-cadherin gene via direct binding to its promoter, as well as production of epithelial proteins such as desmoplakin and claudin, and activate the expression of vimentin and matrix metalloproteinases, thereby increasing cell migration. A team of researchers led by Sanchez-Tillo found that the transcription factor Snail does not occur in normal epithelial cells and that its detection in cells of the tumor invasive front can be considered as a predictor of poor survival of cancer patients. It is believed that ZEB1/2, Snail, and Slug are induced by TGF-β, inflammatory cytokines, and hypoxia. Collective-amoeboid transition Based on experimental data, a number of researchers indicate the possible existence of a so-called collective- amoeboid transition (Fig. 1), when tumor masses invading surrounding tissues in the form of collective multicellular groups dissociate into single migrating cells that use the amoeboid movement. This event has been shown to become possible with the application of inhibitors of integrin receptors of the β1 family, since these molecules play a key role both in the formation of cell-cell contacts and in the interactions between tumor cells and surrounding tissue components. Mesenchymal-epithelial transition There are actually no studies devoted to the investigation of the mechanisms underlying the mesenchymal- epithelial transition. However, the possibility of such a phenomenon is recognized. In this case, it is said that often, e.g. in breast and prostate cancer, the tissue structure in distant metastatic foci is similar to the primary tumor structure. According to Friedl and Gilmour, several assumptions can be made based on these data. First, invasion and metastasis can occur without EMT. Second, detection of single disseminated cells during a routine pathologic examination of tumor tissue samples seems to be a rather complex task, and identification of these cells during EMT is actually impossible. And, third, tumor cells temporarily use the EMT mechanisms for intravasation and spread to distant organs and tissues, where they return to the epithelial phenotype. This transformation is described as the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET). MET has been induced experimentally, and individually moving cells formed multicellular complexes, but the molecular mechanisms of MET under physiological conditions remain unknown. Nguyen et al. demonstrated that the selective inhibitor PD173074 of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) inhibits the MAPK signaling pathway regulating the activity of the AP-1 protein, which, in turn, induces the development of MET. Investigation of the possibility of using the PD173074 inhibitor as a drug, which was conducted on specific tumor cell lines, revealed a distinct suppression of tumor growth, migration ability, and invasion. In this case, a decrease in the expression of Snail and the matrix metalloproteinase 3, 10, 12 and 13 genes and an increase in the expression of the E-cadherin gene were observed. Classification of invasive growth types on the example of breast cancer For many years, our research team has studied the features of breast cancer progression depending on intratumoral heterogeneity. Particular attention has been paid to the phenotypic diversity of the primary tumor in invasive carcinoma of no special type, which accounts for the bulk (80%) of all histological types of breast cancer. Despite the considerable structural diversity of the primary breast tumor, five main types of morphological structures can be distinguished: alveolar, trabecular, tubular and solid structures, and discrete groups of tumor cells (Fig. 2). The alveolar structures are tumor cell clusters of round or slightly irregular shape. The morphology of the cells that form this type of structures varies from small cells with moderate cytoplasm and round nuclei to large cells with hyperchromatic nuclei of irregular shape and moderate cytoplasm. The trabecular structures are either short, linear associations formed by a single row of small, rather monomorphic cells or wide cell clusters consisting of two rows of medium-sized cells with moderate cytoplasm and round normochromic or hyperchromatic nuclei. The tubular structures are formed by a single or two rows of rather monomorphic cells with round normochromic nuclei. The solid structures are fields of various sizes and shapes, consisting of either small cells with moderate cytoplasm and monomorphic nuclei or large cells with abundant cytoplasm and polymorphic nuclei. Discrete groups of cells occur in the form of clusters of one to four cells with variable morphologies. Intratumoral morphological heterogeneity in invasive breast carcinoma. Diversity of invasive growth of breast cancer is shown, which can be classified into five main morphological structures: alveolar (Alv), trabecular (Trab), tubular (Tub), solid (Solid) structures, and discrete groups of tumor cells (Discr). Hematoxylin and eosin staining. Magnification of 200x. According to the data accumulated to date, it may be assumed that different morphological structures of breast tumors correspond to certain types of invasion. Therefore, alveolar, trabecular, and solid structures that are characterized by the presence of cell-cell contacts may be referred to morphological manifestations of collective migration, while discrete groups of tumor cells may be referred to manifestations of individual migration. Interestingly, the first batch of data obtained in a study of the expression of cell adhesion genes fully confirms this hypothesis. For example, there was a decrease in the activity of the genes of cadherins, which are responsible for cell-cell contacts, in the order: solid – alveolar and trabecular structures – discrete groups of tumor cells. In this case, the number of expressed genes of integrins involved in the adhesion of tumor cells to the extracellular matrix was reduced in the order: solid and alveolar – trabecular structures – discrete groups of tumor cells. Types of invasive growth in tumor progression and therapy efficacy Invasive growth and the development of drug resistance are related processes that play the most important role in tumor progression: in particular in metastasis. It is very likely that the same signaling pathways are involved in cell migration and the development of tumor resistance to therapy. Migrating tumor cells (regardless of the movement’s type) are more resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy than non- moving cells. This is largely due to the fact that migrating cells temporarily lose their ability to divide. It is also the fact that moving tumor cells display increased activity of anti-apoptotic genes, which causes resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs aimed at induction of programmed cell death. In addition, cells in the EMT state are known to also exhibit chemoresistance. This drug resistance is due to induction, during EMT, of the synthesis of the ABC family proteins responsible for the efflux of chemotherapeutic drugs out of the cell. The main transcription factors that trigger EMT and, at the same time, positively regulate the activity of ABC transporters include TWIST1, Snail, etc. Recently obtained data indicate strong association between collective migration and resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. According to our own research, breast tumors containing both alveolar and trabecular structures, as well as demonstrating significant morphological diversity, are characterized by increased drug resistance. Interestingly, the contribution of the trabecular structures to chemoresistance is probably explained by the high activity of ABC transporters in tumor cells of a given morphological variant. In contrast, resistance of breast tumors containing the alveolar structure is explained by other, yet unidentified, causes. Invasive growth and its phenotypic diversity are associated, both directly and through the development of drug resistance, with metastasis. Circulating tumor cells, which are responsible for the development of future metastases, are a result of the invasion and subsequent penetration of tumor cells into lymphatic or blood vessels. Not only single migrating tumor cells, but also cell groups can have the intravasation ability. There is an assumption that collective migration much more often leads to metastasis compared to individual migration. Pioneering studies in animal models have demonstrated that metastases more often form after intravenous injection of tumor clusters rather than single tumor cells. Furthermore, circulating tumor cell clusters have been found in the blood of patients with various cancers. It was assumed that collective intravasation is related to the VEGFdependent formation of dilated vasculature and the accumulation of intravasated tumor clusters. Furthermore, groups of tumor cells can enter circulation through damaged vessels or by cooperation with cells in the EMT state and cancer-associated fibroblasts that disrupt the extracellular matrix by proteases. The dependence of metastasis on collective migration is confirmed by the results of our own research. For example, the presence of alveolar structures in tumors in postmenopausal breast cancer patients is associated with a high rate of lymphogenous metastasis, whereas the risk of this type of progression in premenopause females increases with an increase in the number of different types of morphological structures. The latter dependence is also quantitative: lymphogenous metastases were detected more frequently in the case of a larger number of alveolar structures in breast tumors. Furthermore, patients with alveolar structures in tumors had a low metastasis-free survival rate (our own unpublished data). The established relationship between the alveolar structures, as one of the manifestations of collective migration, and the rate of lymphogenous and hematogenous metastasis allows us to put forth the following assumptions. Apparently, the cellular elements of the alveolar structures differ from tumor cells of other structures by a set of biological properties determining the metastatic phenotype. The clearer relationship between alveolar structures and lymphogenous metastasis in the menopausal period suggests a certain role of estrogens, including also their production in situ, in that tumor cells of the alveolar structures gain the metastatic phenotype through the lymphogenous pathway. Therefore, the data currently available on the features of invasive growth in carcinomas of different localizations and, in particular, in breast cancer present new opportunities for the investigation of tumor progression patterns and the search for additional key parameters of prognosis and, possibly, “control” of disease progression. In situ versus invasive By the degree of invasion, a cancer can be classified as in situ when malignant cells are present as a tumor but have not metastasized, or invaded beyond the layer or tissue type where it arose. For example, a cancer of epithelial origin with such features is called carcinoma in situ, and is defined as not having invaded beyond the basement membrane. In contrast, an invasive carcinoma has invaded beyond the basement membrane. Conclusions The significance of studies of the morphological manifestations and molecular genetic mechanisms of the invasion and metastasis of malignant tumors is not in doubt. The results of numerous studies clearly demonstrate that migration of tumor cells during invasive growth can occur both via single cells and via groups of cells. This diversity of cell migration types probably leads to the development of intratumoral heterogeneity that is represented, e.g. in breast cancer, by different morphological structures: alveolar, trabecular, and solid structures and discrete groups of tumor cells. A number of biochemical and molecular genetic mechanisms are known that enable malignant cells to invade surrounding tissues and gain the ability to spread far beyond the primary tumor site, giving rise to the development of secondary metastatic foci in distant organs and tissues. However, despite the achieved progress, there remain unexplored questions concerning a possible relationship between different types of invasive cell growth and the parameters of lymphogenous and hematogenous metastasis, the features of disease progression, as well as the efficacy of the chosen therapy. A solution to these problems could be of great help in determining the disease prognosis and, possibly, developing new approaches to the management of cancer patients.

Its Ottoman-era name was Aynadjik, and its Byzantine-era name was Chalcis ().  History  On account of its location, it is possible that the town is to be identified with the way-station (mutatio) of Bedizum, listed in the late Roman Itinerarium Burdigalense. Chalcis is first attested as a bishopric in the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, which was attended by its iconophile bishop, Sissinios. Another bishop, named Demetrios, is attested through a lead seal dating to the 8th or 9th centuries, and in the 9th century a droungarios named Staurakios or Theophylact. However, the see does not appear in the Notitiae Episcopatuum of the Patriarchate of Constantinople until the reign of Leo VI the Wise (). In 1051, a Pecheneg invasion was defeated near the town. In the Partitio Romaniae, the town is listed as part of an episkepsis along with Rhaidestos and Panion. In Ottoman times, the settlement was named Aynadjik (Αϊναρτζίκ for the local Greek population), and was visited by the traveller Evliya Celebi, who described it as lying in a wide and fruitful plain with tile-roofed houses. Kara Piri Pasha made several donations there. In , the local agriculture is reported as following a two- year cycle of cultivation followed by pasture. The village remained predominantly Greek-populated until the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923; on its eve, in 1922, there were 1,092 Greeks.  Monuments  The town's old mosque (Eski Camii) features four Byzantine-era columns, and its forecourt and garden feature other early and middle Byzantine-era architectural fragments.  Titular see  The diocese of Chalcis was nominally restored in 1933 as a titular see (Chalcis in Europa) by the Roman Catholic Church, but has remained vacant since.

It is only attested in a list of a dozen words collected in the late 18th century.Fodor, István 1975 [1789] Pallas und andere afrikanische Vokabularien vor dem 19. Jahrhundert: Ein Beitrag zur Forschungsgeschichte There is some indication that it might have been a Kru language, but there is not enough data to classify it.  Location  The Mangree were reported to live adjacent to the Kanga, not far from the Mandinga and Amina. A large river formed the border between the Mangree and the Gien. Fodor believes that the location was somewhere around 7° north latitude and that the river was either the Sassandra or the Bandama.  Word list  Fodor reports the following 11 words: :god: yankombum ('jankombum') :sky: tata :sun: lataa :human: mia :foot: trippi :head: tri :man: laniu :woman: auvee ('auwee') :child: pikkeninne :father: amee :mother: pakkabel A brief summary of the source repeats 'head', 'man', 'woman' and adds ichi ('itchi') 'water'.R.G.

Classification  The Mangree language was said to be little different from Gien, which would suggest it was Kru. However, the known vocabulary is not obviously Kru, at least as it was recited and transcribed. The informants were Kanga (also Kru) who said they spoke the language well. Fodor suggests that the word for God may be the same as Twi ' 'God'. The word for 'father' resembles Ewe ame 'human' (and possibly came from a translation of the phrase 'heavenly Father', in which case tata might be 'father' and amee 'sky'), while the word for 'human' resembles Gien me 'human'. The word for 'head' resembles both Twi (with an i vowel) and several Kru languages (with a u vowel). Fodor suggests that the word for 'foot' may be a compound, 'head of the leg'. The word for 'child' resembles Portuguese pequenino (and English piccaninny), which is widespread in West Africa pidgins and creoles. Fodor was not able to find parallels for the other words in Kru or Kwa languages. The vocabulary that resembles Twi may be loanwords.

In three years of racing he won nine of his twenty races, showing consistent top-class form over distances of around one mile. As a two-year-old in 2009 he won the first four of his six races including the Richmond Stakes and the Tattersalls Ireland Sale Stakes. In the following year he won the Greenham Stakes and the Prix Jean Prat, finished second in the 2000 Guineas, Poule d'Essai des Poulains and St James's Palace Stakes and ran third in the Prix de la Forêt. As a four-year-old in 2011 he added victories in the Sandown Mile, Summer Mile Stakes and Premio Vittorio di Capua before being retired to stud at the end of the year. Background Dick Turpin is a bay horse with a white star and snip and four white socks bred by John McEnery at the Rossenarra Stud in Kells, County Kilkenny. As a foal in November 2007 he was offered for sale at Goffs and was bought for €12,000 by Noel McDonnell. A year later he returned to the auction ring at Tattersalls and was sold to Peter Doyle Bloodstock for €26,000. He entered into the ownership of John Manley and was sent into training with Richard Hannon, Sr at East Everleigh in Wiltshire. His sire, Arakan, was an American-bred horse who raced in Europe, winning the Criterion Stakes in 2004 and the Supreme Stakes in 2005. Apart from Dick Turpin, the best of his progeny has been the Toormore. Dick Turpin's dam Merrily showed no racing ability, failing to win in twelve starts. She was a great-granddaughter of Vareta, a French broodmare who won the Prix de la Forêt in 1955 and whose other descendants included Zeddaan (Poule d'Essai des Poulains), Shafaraz (Prix du Cadran), Ashkalani (Poule d'Essai des Poulains, Prix du Moulin) and Zalaiyka (Poule d'Essai des Pouliches). Racing career 2009: two-year-old season Dick Turpin was ridden in five of his six races in 2009 by Richard Hughes. He made his racecourse debut in a maiden race over six furlongs at Windsor Racecourse on 8 June in which he started at odds of 3/1 and won \\"unchallenged\\" by four and a half lengths from fourteen opponents. On 11 July he was ridden by Pat Dobbs when he followed up in a minor event at Salisbury Racecourse, winning \\"readily\\" by six lengths at odds of 8/11. On 31 July the colt was stepped up in class for the Group 2 Richmond Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse and started the 6/5 favourite ahead of eight opponents including Rakaan (third in the Coventry Stakes) and Buzzword. After disputing the lead from the start he \\"stormed clear\\" in the closing stages to win by three lengths from Buzzword. Hughes commented \\"He takes a bit of time to get rolling once you switch him off. He's a very tall horse, with a huge stride. He needs a little break now, as he's a bit on the weak side.\\" On 22 August he was sent to Ireland for the Tattersalls Ireland Sale Stakes at Fairyhouse, a race restricted to horses sold at the 2008 Tattersalls yearling sales. Despite conceding five pounds to his opponents he started the 8/15 favourite and won \\"easily\\" by one and a half lengths from Dragon Fighter. The colt's assistant trainer Richard Hannon Jr. said \\"I think that's our sixth winner of this race but none were better than him... He's won a Group Two so the next step would have to be a Group One, whether that is this year or next. He could be a Guineas horse next year\\". On 4 October Dick Turpin was sent to France and moved up to Group 1 class for the Prix Jean-Luc Lagardère over 1400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. He started the second choice in the betting in a seven-runner field but after racing towards the rear he was unable to catch the leaders and came home fifth behind Siyouni, Pounced, Buzzword and Lope de Vega. Thirteen days later the colt contested the Dewhurst Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse and finished sixth of the fifteen runners behind Beethoven. 2010: three-year- old season On 17 April Dick Turpin made his three-year-old debut in the Greenham Stakes (a trial race for the 2000 Guineas) over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse and started the 8/1 third choice behind his stablemate Canford Cliffs and Arcano in a five-runner field. Ridden for the first time by Ryan Moore he tracked the front-running Canford Cliffs before taking the lead inside the final furlong and winning by half a length. In the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile on 1 May Dick Turpin, a 16/1 outsider, took the lead three furlongs out but was overtaken inside the final furlong and beaten intoecond place by Makfi with Canford Cliffs in third, Xtension fourth and the favourite St Nicholas Abbey in sixth. Fifteen days later the colt was sent to France for the Poule d'Essai des Poulains at Longchamp finished second of the fifteen runners, beaten half a length by Lope de Vega with Buzzword, Siyouni and Poet's Voice unplaced. In the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot Dick Turpin finished runner-up in a Group 1 race for the third time in a row when he was beaten a length by Canford Cliffs with Siyouni, Beethoven and Makfi finishing behind. Richard Hughes resumed the ride when the colt was sent to France again for the Group 1 Prix Jean Prat over 1600 metres at Chantilly Racecourse on 4 July and started at 5/1. Lope de Vega started favourite, while the other six runners included Siyouni, Xtension and Hearts of Fire (Gran Criterium). After racing in third place behind the pacemaker Altair Star and Lope de Vega Dick Turpin took the lead 400 metres from the finish and accelerated away from the field to win \\"easily\\" by four lengths. Richard Hughes commented \\"You get some horses like that which never get to win one and finish second all the time but, now Dick Turpin's broken his duck, the pressure is off\\". At York Racecourse in August Dick Turpin was stepped up in distance for the International Stakes over ten and a half furlongs and came home fifth of the nine runners behind Rip Van Winkle. On his final appearance of the season went back to France for the Prix de la Forêt at Longchamp over 1400 metres and finished third behind Goldikova and Paco Boy, beaten a length by the winner. In the 2010 World Thoroughbred Rankings Dick Turpin was assessed at 124, making him the fourteenth best horse in the world, and the fifth best three-year-old. 2011: four-year-old season On 23 April 2011 Dick Turpin was dropped back from Group 1 class for the first time in over a year when he started 8/13 favourite for the Group 2 bet365 Mile at Sandown Park. His four opponents were Cityscape (Joel Stakes), Music Show, Dream Eater (City of York Stakes) and Higland Knight. With Hughes in the saddle he raced in third before accelerating into the lead approaching the final furlong and winning by two and a quarter lengths from Cityscape. Hannon commented \\"He's a very good horse and we have left a bit behind as this was just a stepping stone really\\" before pointing out the scheduling problems of handling both Dick Turpin and Canford Cliffs saying \\"I'm lucky to have two of the best milers around and I'd love to keep them separate\\". Despite Hannon's hopes Dick Turpin was matched against Canford Cliffs in the Lockinge Stakes at Newbury on 11 May and came home fourth behind his stablemate after being hampered approaching the final furlong. Eleven days later he ran poorly in the Prix d'Ispahan and finished last of the nine runners behind Goldikova. Dick Turpin was dropped back to Group 2 class for the Summer Mile Stakes at Ascot on 9 July and was made the 2/1 second favourite behind the Diomed Stakes winner Side Glance in a five-runner field which also included Red Jazz (Challenge Stakes). Ridden by Pat Dobbs he was settled in fourth place before moving up to take the lead a furlong out and winning by three quarters of a length from Fanunalter. After the race Hannon said \\"It was firm ground in France and he came back a little jarred up, so we gave him time some time off. He's a good horse, he travels so well and has got a good racing brain\\". The colt was back in France in August for the Prix Jacques Le Marois at Deauville Racecourse and ran seventh behind Immortal Verse. On 24 September Dick Turpin was sent to Italy for the Group 1 Premio Vittorio di Capua over 1600 metres at San Siro Racecourse in Milan in which he was ridden by Christophe Soumillon. He started odds-on favourite against six opponents including Cityscape, Fanunalter and the German mare Vanjura. After racing in fifth place he produced a strong run on the outside in the straight, caught Cityscape on the line, and won by a short head. Dick Turpin ended his track career in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot in October in which he came home fifth behind Frankel, Excelebration, Immortal Verse and Dubawi Gold. In the 2011 World Thoroughbred Rankings Dick Turpin was given a rating of 122 making him the twenty-third best racehorse in the world. Stud career Dick Turpin was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at the National Stud. The best of his offspring have included Vintage Brut (National Stakes, Rockingham Stakes) and Billesdon Bess (Upavon Fillies' Stakes).

His father, a merchant, died when he was young and he went to study at Girard College until 1883 and apprenticed to the pharmacist Clement Lowe for five years, receiving a graduate degree from the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy in 1889. He taught materia medica at the College of Pharmacy in the City of New York in 1890 while also studying botany at Barnard college. In 1895 he obtained a bachelor of philosophy degree from the School of Mines, Columbia University and went to Germany where he received a Ph.D. from the University of Marburg under Arthur Mayer with a dissertation on Viola tricolor titled \\"Viola tricolor L. in morphologischer, anatomischer und biologischer Beziehung\\". He returned to Philadelphia College of Pharmacy where he became a professor of botany and pharmacognosy until 1917 in which year he moved to the University of Michigan before retiring after three years.

It is indicated for the treatment of multi-drug-resistant Gram- negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is given by injection into a vein. In September 2020, cefiderocol (Fetroja) received FDA approval as supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for treatment of hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) and ventilator associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP) when caused by Gram-negative bacteria resistant to other antibiotics. Common side effects include diarrhea, infusion site reactions, constipation and rash. It is in the cephalosporin family of medications. Cefiderocol was approved for medical use in the United States in November 2019, and in the European Union in April 2020. Medical uses Cefiderocol is used to treat adults with complicated urinary tract infections, including kidney infections caused by susceptible Gram-negative microorganisms, who have limited or no alternative treatment options. In the United States, cefiderocol is indicated in adults 18 years of age or older who have limited or no alternative treatment options for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs), including pyelonephritis caused by the following susceptible Gram- negative microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter cloacae complex. For the treatment of severe pneumonia (HABP and VABP), it is indicated in patients 18 years of age and older whose pneumonia is not responding to other, more commonly used antibiotics and is confirmed to be caused by one of the following Gram-negative organisms: * Acinetobacter baumannii complex * Escherichia coli * Enterobacter cloacae complex * Klebsiella pneumoniae * Pseudomonas aeruginosa * Serratia marcescens This indication is supported by the APEKS-NP study, where cefiderocol was compared to meropenem (a widely used antibiotic for multidrug-resistant bacteria causing pneumonia, among other diseases), where it was shown not to be inferior to meropenem. The primary endpoint of the study was all-cause mortality at day 14, where both antibiotics were shown to be almost equally effective. In the European Union, cefiderocol is indicated for the treatment of infections due to aerobic Gram- negative organisms in adults with limited treatment options. Adverse effects An increased risk of dying was observed in people treated with cefiderocol as compared to other antibiotics in a separate clinical trial. Most of the deaths occurred in people hospitalized with other kinds of severe bacterial infections (pneumonia, sepsis, or infection in the blood). The cause of death was not clear. Cefiderocol may cause serious and life-threatening allergic reactions, severe diarrhea caused by C. difficile and seizures. Labeling for cefiderocol includes a warning regarding the higher all-cause mortality rate observed in cefiderocol-treated people compared to those treated with other antibiotics in a trial in critically ill people with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections. The cause of the increase in mortality has not been established. Some of the deaths were a result of worsening or complications of infection, or underlying co- morbidities. The higher all-cause mortality rate was observed in people treated for hospital-acquired/ventilator-associated pneumonia (i.e.nosocomial pneumonia), bloodstream infections, or sepsis. The safety and efficacy of cefiderocol has not been established for the treatment of these types of infections. Pharmacology Mechanism of action Its mechanism of entry into bacterial cells is by binding to iron, which is actively transported into the bacterial cells along with the cefiderocol. It is in a medication class known as siderophores, and was the first siderophore antibiotic to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It bypasses the bacterial porin channels by using the bacteria's own iron-transport system for being transported in. History In 2019, cefiderocol was approved in the United States as an antibacterial drug for treatment of adults 18 years of age or older with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including kidney infections caused by susceptible Gram-negative microorganisms, who have limited or no alternative treatment options. The safety and effectiveness of cefiderocol was demonstrated in a study (NCT02321800) of 448 participants with cUTIs. Of the participants who were administered cefiderocol, 72.6% had resolution of symptoms and eradication of the bacteria approximately seven days after completing treatment, compared with 54.6% in participants who received an alternative antibiotic. The clinical response rates were similar between the two treatment groups. The trial included participants from Europe, United States and Mexico. In the clinical trial, participants with cUTI were chosen at random to receive cefiderocol, or another antibacterial drug called imipenem/cilastatin. Both treatments were given intravenously for 7–14 days and neither the participants nor the health care professionals knew which drugs were given until after the trial was complete. Participants could not be switched to an oral antibacterial drug to complete the treatment for cUTI. The benefit of cefiderocol was measured by the proportion of participants who achieved cure or improvement in their symptoms related to cUTI and a negative urine culture test in comparison to imipenem/cilastatin. Cefiderocol received a Qualified Infectious Disease Product designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and was granted priority review. The FDA granted approval of Fetroja, on 14 November 2019, to Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Cefiderocol was approved for medical use in the European Union in April 2020.

The instrument is both a wind instrument and percussion instrument. As a wind instrument, it is played by placing it against the mouth and plucking the reed. The hand holding the instrument holds it with the thumb and forefinger facing each other, holding it firmly. This adds mass to the instrument and makes it louder. The mouth acts as a resonator and as a tool to alter the sound. Although mainly a folk instrument, better-made examples exist.

She is currently a Director at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research.http://brain.mpg.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Documents/Schuman_full_CV_October_2018.pdf Career Erin Schuman attended the University of Southern California (USC), where she received her B.A. in Psychology (1985). She continued her education to obtain a Ph.D. in Neuroscience from Princeton University (1990). She conducted postdoctoral research from 1990-1993 in Daniel V. Madison’s lab in the Molecular and Cellular Physiology Department at Stanford University. From there, Schuman was recruited to join the faculty in the Division of Biology at the California Institute of Technology where she moved up the ranks from Assistant to Full Professor. During this time, she was also appointed investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. In 2009, she was recruited as the Director of Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, at which she holds her current position.https://brain.mpg.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Documents/Schuman_full_CV_April_2019.pdf} Research The Schuman lab studies the properties of mRNAs and proteins (e.g. the transcriptomes and proteomes) distributed throughout the neuron. Her research has examined how stability in neuronal processes can be brought about by local cell biological processes, like protein synthesis, allowing synapses to respond rapidly and appropriately to changing stimuli. The Schuman lab demonstrated the first functional role for local translation in neurons. In 1996, in the course of exploring how neurotrophins enhance synaptic transmission, Schuman together with graduate student Hyejin Kang made the discovery that local protein synthesis within dendrites is required for this form of synaptic plasticity. She obtained direct proof that protein synthesis occurs in intact, but isolated dendrites. This, together with a few other key observations, gave birth to the field of local translation. Her team discovered, using next generation sequencing, over 2500 mRNAs localized to the neuropil. In addition, Schuman and collaborators (Dave Tirrell, Caltech and Daniela Dieterich, Magdeburg) has made invaluable technical contributions most notable perhaps is the development of non-canonical amino acid metabolic labelling, click chemistry, and mutation of cell-biological enzymes (the BONCAT and FUNCAT techniques) enabling the labelling, purification, identification and visualization of newly synthesized proteins in neurons and other cells. Advocacy for Women in Neuroscience In addition to her research and professorship, Erin Schuman has been committed to promoting the professional advancement of women in the field of neuroscience. Schuman made it a condition of her recruitment to Max Planck that a new child care facility be built on campus. She also spearheaded an initiative outlining changes in recruitment practices aimed at doubling the percentage of female directors in the Max Planck Society's Biology & Medicine Section to 20% by 2020.

The soldiers were sent by Maharaja of Marwar to cut the trees in the village of Khejarli to provide wood for a new palace The killings were carried out on the orders of his minister Giridhar Bhandari. The effort had a long term impact on the environmental advocacy, and the massacre later became known as a precursor to the 20th century Chipko movement. This sacrifice for the trees is well stated in the words of Amrita Devi Bishnoi, \\"Sir santhe runkh rahe, to bhi sasti jaan\\". The same offer was given by her three daughters and more than 300 bishnois ladies. It was due to this great sacrifice that the ruler took back his earlier order of felling trees.  History  363 Sacrifice Memorial Site In 1726, Abhai Singh of Marwar gained control of the village of khejarli , also known as Jalnadiya Khejarli, District-Jodhpur। in Rajasthan।. In 1730, he dispatched one of his ministers, Giridhar Bhandari, to collect wood to be used in the construction of a new palace; some sources report that the wood was needed to build the palace, while others note the Marwars intended to burn the trees to create lime. Regardless of intended purpose, Bhandari and his entourage of soldiers arrived in Jehnad, where they demanded access to the village's trees. Led by a woman named Amrita Devi Bishnoi, the villagers refused to surrender their trees to the Raj's soldiers. Amrita stated that the Khejri trees were sacred to the Bishnois, and her faith prohibited her from allowing the trees to be cut down.Gottlieb, Roger S. “Bishnois: Defenders of the Environment.” This Sacred Earth: Religion, Nature, Environment. Psychology Press, 1996. pp. 159-160 The situation escalated, and the Marwan party offered to leave the village's Khejri trees alone in exchange for a bribe. However, this was seen as a grievous insult to the Bishnoi faith, and Amrita announced that she would rather die than allow the trees to be cut down. She and her family began hugging the Khejris, shielding the trees with their bodies. Angered by the rebuke, the Marwans beheaded Amrita and three of her daughters before beginning to cut down the trees. Amrita's last words were recorded as being \\"A chopped head is cheaper than a chopped tree\\", and this couplet later became a rallying cry for the Bishnois. News of the ongoing desecration of Jehnad's trees quickly spread among Rajasthan's Bishnoi population. In all, Bishnois from 83 villages began to travel to Jehnad in an attempt to save the trees, and a council was convened to determine what could be done about the situation. The council's decision was that each Bishnoi volunteer would lay down their life to defend one of the threatened trees. Older people went forward first, with many of them being killed as they hugged the Khejris. Seeing this as an opportunity, Giridhar Bhandari claimed that the Bishnoi were only sending forward people whom they thought were useless to be killed. In response, younger men, women, and children began to hug the trees, resulting in many of them being killed as well. In all, 363 Bishnois were killed while protecting the trees.Reichert A. (2016) Transformative Encounters: Destabilising Human/Animal and Nature/Culture Binaries Through Cross-Cultural Engagement. Shocked by the passive resistance of the Bishnois, Abhai Singh recalled his men and personally traveled to the village to apologize for his minister's actions. He decreed that the village would never again be compelled to provide wood for the kingdom. The village was later renamed Khejarli, and the site of the massacre became a place of pilgrimage for the Bishnoi faith.  Legacy  The Khejarli Massacre was an inspiration for the 20th century environmentalist Chipko movement. Several temples and a cenotaph in Khejarli commemorate the massacre, and the village is the site of an annual Bishnoi ceremony held in honor of the event. A fair is organized every year on Shukla Dashmi of Bhadrapad (Hindi month) in September at Khejarli, Jodhpur, to pay homage to the great martyrs of environment protection. The Government of India also instituted an award, the “Amrita Devi Environment Protection Award”, recognizing the sacrifice of Amrita Devi. The government of India has declared the day of the massacre (11 September) as National Forest Martyr's Day.

He was also the editor of multiple abolitionist newspapers such as The Northern Star and The Impartial Citizen.  Birth and early life  Stephen Myers was born a slave in Hoosick, New York around the year 1800. He was supposedly released in 1818 by his owner General Warren. However Warren's identity remains a subject of ambiguity, there are also noted to be no records of Myers' manumission in the Albany County records. After his release he met and married Harriet Johnson in Troy, New York in 1827, and after the wedding they moved into the house at 194 Livingston Avenue in Albany.  Underground Railroad contributions  His major contributions to the Underground Railroad include sending runaway slaves to Canada from Albany. Myers's newspaper the Northern Star also served as another Underground Railroad organization. In the public eye, the paper increased abolitionist rhetoric, but the organization also worked in conjunction with the Vigilance Committee to raise funds and provide safe houses for runaway slaves. During this period of cooperation, Myers and Rev. Torrey of the Vigilance Committee had a slightly hostile relationship. This was due to both sides accusing each other of not providing an adequate amount of aid to slaves attempting to escape. Myers simply responded by saying that he helped many individuals without any aide from the Vigilance Committee. This feud dissipated and Myers eventually became a member of the Albany Vigilance Committee in the 1850s, even becoming the chairman of the organization for approximately 3 years.\\"The Vigilance Committee in Albany. - Underground Railroad History Project\\". Underground Railroad History Project. Retrieved 2018-11-26. The fundraising and primary return address for correspondence was run through the Myers's home address which also served as a safe house for slaves during their escape to the North. The odd thing was that Myers having fugitive slaves in his home was not a secret affair, it was simply treated as common knowledge in regards to Myers's involvement with the Underground Railroad. Myers is noted as an important contributor and agent of the Underground Railroad by many different abolitionists including Frederick Douglass.Ripley, Peter (1991). The Black Abolitionist Papers. Vol. IV. The University of North Carolina Press. pp. 326–330.Siebert, Wilbur (1898). The Underground Railroad from Slavery to Freedom. New York: Macmillan Company.  Later life and death  Myers eventually merged the Northern Star with another newspaper known as the True American to create the Impartial Citizen which published out of Syracuse, New York.

Published on November 25, 1917 in the Newspaper of the Provisional Workers and Peasants Government and Izvestia, on December 21, 1917 published in the Assembly of the Laws and Regulations of the Workers and Peasants Government. The decree contained a provision (Article No. 7) on the entry into force “from the date of its publication”. The decree was intended to abolish the estates and estate legal instruments — classes, titles and civil ranks of the Russian Empire on the territory of Soviet Russia, to introduce the legal equality of all citizens of the new state. History Before the October Revolution, in the Russian Empire there was an institute of allegiance, which enshrined the legal inequality of the subjects, in many ways it has developed in the feudal Middle Ages. By 1917, the subjects of the Russian Empire were subdivided into several categories (classes) with a special legal status: *natural subjects, which, in turn, stood out: *#nobles (hereditary and personal); *#clerics (shared by religion); *#urban inhabitants (divided into groups: honorary citizens, merchants, tradesmen and shopkeepers); *#rural inhabitants; *Inorodtsy (Jews and Eastern peoples); *Finnish inhabitants. Imperial legislation related to the belonging to one or another category of subjects by very significant differences in rights and duties. For example, four groups of natural subjects were divided into persons of taxable and non-taxable status. Persons of non-taxable status (noblemen and honorary citizens) enjoyed freedom of movement and received indefinite passports to live throughout the Russian Empire; persons of the taxable state (burghers and peasants) did not have such rights. Belonging to the estate was inherited, the transition from one class to another was rather difficult. The decree contained the following basic provisions: > 1\\\\. All the estates and class divisions of citizens that existed before in > Russia, the estate privileges and restrictions, the estate organizations and > institutions, as well as all civil ranks are abolished. > 2\\\\. Any titles (nobleman, merchant, tradesman, peasant, etc., princely, > county titles, etc.) and the name of civilian officials (secret, state and > other advisers) are destroyed and one common name for the entire Russian > population is established — citizens of the Russian Republic. According to article 3 of the decree, the property of the noble-class institutions, merchant and petty-bourgeois societies was transferred to the respective local and city governments. Characteristic and significance Decree Abolishing Classes and Civil Ranks abolished estates and estate legal instruments — classes, titles and civilian ranks of the Russian Empire on the territory of Soviet Russia, and also introduced the concept of Russian citizenship. For example, on its basis, on April 5, 1918, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee adopted a Decree “On the Acquisition of the Rights of Russian Citizenship”On the Acquisition of the Rights of Russian Citizenship, which allowed an foreigner living within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic to become a Russian citizen. The decree affected all subsequent legislation of the RSFSR and the USSR on citizenship.

History The company was founded in Herkimer, NY by George Cogar, Lauren King, and Ted Robinson, former Univac employees. Their success in selling their first product, a Key-to-Tape Data Entry device that allowed doing away with Keypunch devices, brought them enough cash to also grow via acquisition. Among their acquisitions was the developer of a minicomputer, the Atron 501 and 502. From the know-how acquired and absorbed, Mohawk expanded into the areas of controlling line printers and also Remote Job Entry (RJE). This was the basis of their MDS 2400 RJE product, which supported 2780 and HASP. Financial difficulties a decade-and-a-half after the company opened led to the company's restructuring, renaming and eventual takeover. By that time, headquarters had been in Parsippany, NJ, with manufacturing in Herkimer, NY.

It is found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea where it burrows in soft sediment. Taxonomy This species was first described in 1853 by the British naturalist Philip Henry Gosse as Ilyanthus mitchellii. In 1881, the Italian zoologist Angelo Andres described a new species of sea anemone, Mesacmaea stellatus, and erecting the genus Mesacmaea to accommodate it. Since then, Mesacmaea stellatus has been synonymised with Ilyanthus mitchellii, the species becoming Mesacmaea mitchellii. Two other species from the genus Ilyanthus have also been transferred to the genus Mesacmaea. Description M. mitchellii is a robust and distinctive burrowing sea anemone. The column is pear-shaped with a rounded base, and is divided into a scapus, the main part of the column, and a scapulus, a smooth retractile region; the physa, or basal region, is able to adhere firmly to a hard surface but is not normally attached because the animal habitually burrows. The scapus often has sand grains sticking to it. The oral disc bears up to 36 tentacles in several cycles; the inner cycle contains seven tentacles which tend to be raised above the central mouth while the remaining tentacles are spread widely over the surface of the sediment. The column can be up to across and including the extended tentacles. The scapus is generally reddish, orange or buff, the scapulus is grey, and the oral disc and tentacles are patterned in brown, cream and red. Internally, the pharynx has a single siphonoglyph (ciliated groove) and the gastrovascular cavity is subdivided by complete mesenteries, no incomplete mesenteries being present. The retractor muscles are strong. Distribution and habitat Mesacmaea mitchellii is native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean where it occurs in the sublittoral zone around the coasts of Britain and Western Europe and in the Mediterranean Sea. Its depth range is between and its habitat is soft sediment such as sand and gravel. The base of the column is used for burrowing, and the animal feeds with only the top of the column, oral disc and tentacles above the sediment.

Initially the most northerly province of Alodia, it appeared as an independent kingdom from 1276. Henceforth it was repeatedly recorded by Arabic sources in relation to the wars between its northern neighbour Makuria and the Egyptian Mamluk sultanate, where it generally sided with the latter. In 1367 it is mentioned for the last time, but based on pottery finds it has been suggested that the kingdom continued to exist until the 15th, perhaps even the 16th, century. During the reign of Funj king Amara Dunqas () the region is known to have become part of the Funj sultanate. Location Al-Abwab still has not been precisely located. Al-Aswani wrote in the 10th century that the Atbara was located within al-Abwab, but also implied that its northern border was further north, at the great Nile bend. In 1317 al-Abwab was located around the confluence of the Atbara and the Nile, while in 1289 it was recorded that it could be reached after travelling three days from Mograt Island, suggesting that its northern border was in the proximity of Abu Hamad. In the early 20th century it was noted that Sudanese used the term al-Abwab to describe a region in the proximity of Meroe. Archaeologist David Edwards states that the material culture of the Nile Valley between Abu Hamad, where the Nile bends westwards, and the Atbara was affiliated with Makuria rather than Alodia. History Very little is known about the history of al-Abwab. Before becoming independent it was the northernmost province of Alodia. It seems that the province was governed by an official appointed by the Alodian king. Archaeological evidence from Soba, the capital of Alodia, suggests a decline of the town and therefore possibly the whole kingdom from the 12th century. Is it not known how al-Abwab seceded from Alodia, but by 1276 it appeared as an independent kingdom which, according to al-Mufaddal, controlled \\"vast territories\\". It was mentioned in relation to the war between Makuria and the Mamluk sultanate: David of Makuria had attacked Aydhab and Aswan, provoking the Mamluk sultan Baybars to retaliate. In March 1276 the latter reached Dongola, where David was defeated in battle. Afterwards he fled to the kingdom of al-Abwab in the south. However, Adur, the king of al-Abwab, handed him over to the Muslims, which, according to al-Nuwayri, happened after Adur defeated David in battle and captured him afterwards. Al-Mufaddal stated that he handed David over because he was afraid of the Mamluk sultan. In consequence of this war a Mamluk puppet king was instated in Dongola, and was watched over by an Assassin from al-Abwab. In 1286 Adur is mentioned again. He is recorded as having sent an ambassador to the Mamluk sultan, who not only presented him with gifts in the form of an elephant and a giraffe, but also professed obedience to him. Furthermore, the ambassador complained about the hostility of the Mamluk puppet king in Dongola. Early the following year the Mamluks sent an ambassador back. In 1290 Adur is said to have waged a campaign against a Makuria king named Any, who had fled the country in 1289. However, it is far from clear who Any was: in 1289 the kings in Dongola were named Shemamun and Budemma. It is possible that he was merely a chieftain. Apart of the war against Any, Adur was also engaged in a campaign against an unnamed king who had invaded the land of Anaj, possibly referring to Alodia. He claimed that once his campaigns were successful the entire Bilad al-Sudan would be under the authority of the Mamluk sultan. In 1292 Adur was accused by the king of Makuria of devastating his country. In 1316 the Mamluks again invaded Makuria, intending to replace the disobedient king Karanbas with a Muslim monarch: Barshambu. Karanbas fled to al-Abwab, but as 40 years before the king of al- Abwab had him seized and handed over to the Mamluks. One year later al-Abwab came into direct contact with the Mamluks: A Mamluk army pursued Bedouin brigands through central Sudan, following them to the port town of Sawakin, then westwards to the Atbara, which they followed upstream until reaching Kassala. Ultimately failing to catch the nomads, the Mamluks marched back downstream the Atbara until reaching al-Abwab. Al-Nuwayri claimed that al- Abwab's monarch, while too afraid to meet the army, sent them provisions. Despite this the Mamluk army began to plunder the country for food before finally continuing their march to Dongola. In the 14th and 15th centuries Bedouin tribes overran much of Sudan. By 1367 it was recorded that the Mamluk sultan corresponded with a Shaikh Junayd of the Arab Jawabira tribe, a branch of the Banu Ikrima, who had arrived in Nubia while accompanying the Mamluk invasions. He was recorded by al-Qalqashandi to have resided in al-Abwab, together with another Arab tribal Shaikh named Sharif. There is no mention of al-Abwab in sources after the 14th century. However, archaeological evidence from the region suggests that al-Abwab survived until the rise of the Funj sultanate, as Christian pottery has been found together with Funj pottery. Thus, it has been concluded that the state \\"certainly\\" thrived until the 15th and possibly even the 16th century. During the reign of the first Funj king, Amara Dunqas (), the Sudanese Nile Valley as far north as Dongola was unified under his rule. Religion Al-Qashqandi wrote in 1412 that the king of al- Abwab had a similar titulature to the king of Armenia, implying that al-Abwab was a Christian state. Christian pottery continued to be produced in the region until the rise of the Funj. On the other hand, King Adur was probably a Muslim. The Assassin who was ordered by Sultan Baybars to watch over the Makurian puppet king was an Ismaeli Muslim. The Bedouin tribes that overran Nubia in the 14th and 15th centuries were Muslim, albeit only nominally. Nevertheless, they contributed to the Islamization of the country by intermarrying with the Nubians. According to Sudanese traditions a Sufi teacher arrived in the region in the 15th century, with some claiming that he settled in Berber in 1445, while others state that he settled near al-Mahmiya (north of Meroe) at the end of the 15th century.

It tells the story of Kati, who first travels to America, then to Italy and Paris. The novels were translated into many languages including English, German, Spanish, French and Russian.  Characters   Kati  Kati is 21 and works as a typist in an office in Stockholm. Kati lost her parents as a small child. After that, she moved in with her aunt Wilhelmina.  Eva  Eva is Kati's best friend. At the age of 20, Eva moves from Aamaal to Stockholm. There she works together with Kati in an office. At the age of 22 Eva travels with Kati to Italy and later to Paris. Eva is blond, very talkative and quick-witted. She falls in love very fast but loses interest just as quickly.  Aunt Wilhelmina  Kati grows up with her aunt Wilhelmina. She has a very ambivalent relationship with Wilhelmina. On the one hand, she loves her very much, on the other hand, she wants to be independent from her. Aunt Wilhelmina, who is simply called aunt by Kati, still thinks that Kati is the small, dear, helpless child that came to Wilhelmina after her parents died. Therefore she organises everything for Kati, even though Kati has already grown up. Kati's aunt is a bit old- fashioned and very religious. She seems very strict at first, but is very nice. Therefore, she takes her promise, that she gave Kati's mother on the deathbed, to take care of Kati very seriously. When Wilhelmina learns that Kati wants to go to America, she wants to join Kati to protect her. Later, Wilhelmina stays in America to marry Andrew. Even from America, she keeps in touch with Kati and supports her. For example, she contributes money for Kati's trip to Italy.  Jan  Jan is a young, promising architect who does not have much money. He starts dating Kati when she is 19 years old. Later he tells Kati about his trips to America, which is why Kati wants to travel there. While Jan loves Kati, Kati is not sure about her feelings.  Lennart Sundman  Lennart grows up in Sweden near the lake Kamholmsfjord. Then he moves to the west coast, along with his parents. As an only child he loves animals, especially dogs, very much. His father dies when Lennart is very young. Later Lennart becomes a lawyer and moves to Stockholm. In Italy, he meets Kati and falls in love with her. Lennart is very dark with a southern brown skin. He is described as intelligent, calm, sincere and tender. Lennart laughs a lot, but at the same time he also has melancholic and childlike traits.  Peter Bjökman  Peter grows up in Sweden along with his parents. Peter's father loved only one woman, Peter's mother. However, she constantly cheated on him. When she died, Peter's father nearly mourned to death. Peter does not want to experience the same and decides not commit to any woman. That changes, however, when he meets Eve. Peter is a wealthy businessman and sells printing presses. He is tall and dances very well.  Andrew  Andrew is Aunt Wilhelmina's old childhood friend. When the two meet again in America, Andrew makes Wilhelmina a marriage proposal. Wilhelmina decides to stay in America.  Story  Kati in America plays in 1945. At that time the racial segregation still existed. This is also described in Lindgren's novel Kati in America. In Kati in Italy Kati is one year older. Seven months after the events in Italy Kati in Paris starts.  Kati in America  Kati's friend Jan tells her about his trip to the USA. Kati gets excited about it and wants to go there as well. She tells her Aunt Wilhelmina about it. Wilhelmina doesn't want Kati to travel alone and decides to join her. In New York, Kati meets Mr Bates who lost his cook and his maid. He needs someone to cook for his twelve guests in the evening. Wilhelmina helps out. Through Mr Bates' daughter Marion meets Kati Bob, with whom she travels through America. Wilhelmina is not very fond of Bob, but still participates in the road trip. When Kati sees how black people are being treated in America, she is shocked. There are seating arrangements in buses, black people live in poorer areas, have less access to work and education, are not allowed to enter restaurants or concerts for white people etc. A chauffeur tells Katie that a \\"good nigger only is a nigger, a half feet underground\\". Some of Kati's new friends believe that the white race needs to maintain their supremacy. Furthermore, they don't want to shake the hands of a black person. Kati tries to support the black people, but finds it very hard. After Kati has met Bob's family, Bob and Kati's ways separate. While Wilhelmina is happy that Bob is gone, Kati misses him at first. Later, however, she enjoys the trips to the Mississippi and New Orleans. There she meets the guide John Hammond, with whom she enjoys a nice evening. In Chicago, Kati and Wilhelmina meet Kati's uncle Elof, who emigrated to America at the age of 22. Elof invites Kati and Wilhelmina to his home. There Wilhelmina meets Andrew, an old childhood friend. The two fall in love and want to marry. Wilhelmina stays in America. In New York, Kati meets Bob for the last time before heading home to Sweden. In Sweden Jan waits for Kati at the airport.  Kati in Italy  Jan wants to marry Kati. However, Kati has doubts. It bothers her that Jan always tries to change her into a different person. If she is funny, he finds her silly, but at the same time she is not allowed to be too serious. She asks Jan to give her one year time to decide whether she wants to marry him or not. When Jan agrees, she directly asks her best friend Eva to move in with her. When Kati and Eva win 3,000 crowns, they decide to travel to Italy. Jan doesn't like this as he is afraid about losing Kati to an Italian man. However, Kati and Eva plan to leave any way. In Italy, they experience many adventures. In Venice, Kati meets Lennart Sundman from Stockholm. She is immediately fascinated by the handsome, southern-looking man. The two make a beautiful gondola ride. However, they lose each other in the crowd in the piazza and can not find each other again. Although Kati thinks she has lost Lennart forever, she believes that he is her true love. She writes to Jan in a letter and breaks up with him. Kati and Eva travel to Florence. When Kati looks at engagement rings at a jewellery store, Kati suddenly meets Lennart again. The two spend a lot of time together. While Kati is sure of her feelings for Lennart, she wonders what Lennart think about her. In Rome, Lennart does not call as he has promised before. Instead, Kati receives a lovely letter from Jan, in which he explains that he hopes Kati has found someone else who will make her happier than he ever could. Nevertheless, he hopes that she would think with warmth of the time together. Kati does so, but she's also always longing for Lennart. One night Eva does not want to go out because of a headache. That is why Kati spends the evening together with another traveller. In a restaurant she discovers Eva and Lennart, who are sitting and laughing there together. Shocked and deeply disappointed, Kati runs out of the restaurant. The next day Kati and Eva drive to Naples. There Kati tells Eva about her observations in the restaurant. Eva explains that Lennart called when Kati was gone, and she did not want to let him go because of Kati. She had met with him and persuaded him to change his travel plans. Suddenly Lennart stands in front of the Kati. Kati and Lennart spend a lovely time together. Quite surprisingly, Lennart asks Kati if she wants to marry him. He bought her the engagement rings she was already looking at in Florence. Kati agrees.  Kati in Paris  Seven months after Lennart's marriage proposal, Kati and Lennart travel to Paris to get married. They marry in a small chapel. After their wedding, Eva, Lennart and Kati travel through Paris together and take a closer look at the city. At Café Flore they meet Peter Björkmann, a rich business man from Sweden. Peter is interested in Eva. However, Eva prefers to do something with Henri Bertrand, a student from the next room in the hotel. At a dinner together, Eva and Peter tell each other that they both do not want to commit to anyone and also do not want marry. Eva tells about Henri Bertrand, while Peter says that he is currently interested in Eva, but that this would pass by. In the evening Eva dances with Peter and is thrilled about his dancing skills. However, she often ignores him later to be with Henri. Back in Stockholm, Lennart and Kati move into a new flat, directly opposite to Eva's flat. Eva cries as she returns to her flat alone, without her former flatmate Kati. But she is often invited by Kati and Lennart. Peter also visits the friends. He tells Kati that he is still in love with Eva, because she is giving him the diversity and change he is longing for. He even wants to marry Eva. Meanwhile, Lennart and Kati have their first bigger fight. Just when they start to get along better Kati suddenly meets Jan in the city. They are drinking a coffee together and Jan shows Kati his engagement ring. When Lennart gets to know about the meeting, he leaves the flat in rage. Later the couple decides to reconcile. Soon after this Peter confesses his love to Eva, but Eva rejects him. Peter decides not to visit Lennart and Kati any longer because he could meet Eva there. A few months later Kati becomes pregnant and prepares for the birth. Meanwhile, Eva has changed. She cries a lot and often stays alone in her flat. Peter starts to visit Kati and Lennart again. He says he has missed them and comes into their flat. Shortly after this, Eva also join the flat. When she realises that Peter is there as well, she turns pale. Eva admits that she might be in love with Peter. The two want to try to be together. Soon after this, Kati gets her first son.  Background  In 1949 Astrid Lindgren was asked by a publisher of Bonniers to write a series of travelling stories for the magazine Damernas värld. When Lindgren had written the series, the publisher realised that they should also be published in book form. The stories, which were originally meant for grown-ups, were changed into a set of three girl novels. The Swedish editions were published in 1950 (Kati i Amerika), 1952 (Kati på Kaptensgatan) and 1953 (Kati i Paris). The text remained mainly the same, however small edits have been made. A critical section on Catholic customs was removed in the girls books, as well as some interactions between Kati and her aunt and some landmarks during the journey through southern France. The books were illustrated by Margit Uppenberg under the pseudonym Gobi (Kati i Amerika and Kati i Italien) and by Maivor Persson Malm (Kati i Paris). Kati in America is based on Lindgren's own experiences in America. During a trip to New Orleans Lindgren experienced a lot of racism. White people didn't want to shake the hands of black people. A white taxi driver explained: \\"A good negro is a negro, that is five feet under ground.\\" (en bra neger, det är en neger som ligger fem fot under jorden.) Astrid Lindgren was shocked. Her protagonist Kati experiences similar things. Astrid Lindgren also processed other experiences in her book. Kati locks herself out with a pot of potatoes on the stove. She climbs the façade on the fifth floor and climbs into the flat through the kitchen window. Lindgren has experienced this as well. In Kati in Italy and Kati in Paris she processed experiences from travelling with her husband to Italy and France. In an exchange of letters with a reader, Astrid Lindgren explains she did not really feel like Kati at the age of 19 or 20. At that age she was struggling with her life. Only later did she thought that life was quite pleasant. Kati was more grown-up than she in the book.Andersen, Jens: Astrid Lindgren. Ihr Leben.  Reviews  Jörg Bohn explains that the books were still listed as \\"exciting, refreshingly unconventional and timelessly modern\\" at the time of publication. However, now there are a little out dated. Today, they are a good representation of the life in the 1940s and 1950s, Fredrik Sonck believes that the series should be viewed as a time document and deserves to be read for the sake of the Linden-Greek language. It also shows how language is changing. Nowadays the word negro is unusable, except if the use of it is problemized or discussed. In the books Lindgren depicts words like \\"nigger\\", \\"pickaninnie\\" and \\"darkie\\" as depriving. However, she uses the word negro a dozen times, showing that connotations to the word might simply not have arisen back then, or they were so deeply embedded in the word that people of that time could not identify them. In her books Astrid Lindgren critically examines the racism in America. Her protagonist Kati is shocked about the racial segregation and the way black people were threatened. Gabrielle Cromme praises that Lindgren's Kati series does without any \\"pedagogical intervention\\". According to her many other girl novels during that time would try to educate the girls. In the Kati books the joy and cosmopolitanism are dominant.Cromme, Gabriele (1996): Astrid Lindgren und die Autarkie der Weiblichkeit. Literarische Darstellung von Frauen und Mädchen in ihrem Gesamtwerk. Kovac: Hamburg. S. 119, 207 Jana Mikota adds that the Kati series don't correspond with \\"the traditional understanding of girls literature\\". The readers meet young women who are interested in literature, history and politics. The girls are quick-witted and can laugh at themselves. Birgitta Theander loved the huge joy of life the books represent. According to her the dialogue is always fast and beautiful. She thinks that within the books the reader gets closer to Kati's personal emotional life. The love story in Kati is \\"pardon, madness and bliss\\" (\\"den är hänryckning, kval och salighet\\").

Development  In 2015 the Japanese defense budget allocated funds to study the construction of a new “compact-type hull destroyer with additional multi-functional capabilities” as well as a new radar system for the destroyer. In the same year Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) unveiled the frigate's first concept model (30FF) which they have been developing with their own funds. In August 2017, the Acquisition, Technology & Logistics Agency (ATLA) selected MHI and Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding as the prime contractor and subcontractor to construct the frigate. In addition, the agency also selected a completely new design of the vessel (30DX). The new ship is set to replace the Asagiri-class destroyer and Abukuma-class destroyer escort. Construction of the 30DX is to begin in 2018. A total of twenty-two units is planned by 2032 and eight are currently under contract; a pair to be built each year.Acquisition Program Analysis and Evaluation Report(New frigate), page.27-28 - Ministry of Defense (Japan), 31 August 2018  Design  The original design to be used was the 30FF model. The ship's design looks similar to the Freedom-class littoral combat ship with an integrated mast. Its armament included a 5\\"/54 caliber Mark 45 gun, two Remote weapon stations between the bridge and main gun, a SeaRAM above the helicopter hangar, and a helicopter. The length of the vessel is 120 m, with a max beam of 18 m, and displacement of about 3000 metric tons. It would be able to reach 40 knots and accommodate a crew of about 100. However, the 30DX model was later chosen to be constructed. The 30DX design (although modern) is more conservative compared to the 30FF's more radical approach. The three main factors for the design change is due to the need for affordability, miniaturization/automation, and multi-mission capabilities. The vessel has an overall length of 130 m, breadth of 16 m, a standard displacement of 3900 tons with a full load displacement of about 5500 tons, and a maximum speed of over 30 knots. Weapons include a Mk 45 gun, two remote weapon station above the bridge, 16 Mk 41 VLS at the bow, 8 anti-ship missiles, one SeaRAM, an SH-60L helicopter, torpedoes, and decoy launchers. It can also deploy and recover UUV, USV, and sea mines from the rear ramp beneath the helideck. It is also expected to use a naval version of the Type 03 Chū-SAM. The stealthy design of both models is based on the research and development from the Mitsubishi X-2 Shinshin (then ATD-X) stealth fighter technology demonstrator, as both platforms are designed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Along with stealth capabilities, the frigate also emphasizes on having a high level of automation. This allows the frigate to possess a low crew size of only 90 personnel compared to other ships of similar size. The frigates will be powered by a Rolls-Royce MT30 Gas Turbine. The overall design of the 30DX is to achieve a frigate sized vessel with the capabilities similar to the Akizuki-class destroyer. At Sea Air Space 2019, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries revealed 'Advanced Integrated CIC' for the vessel. According to the report, it combined wheelhouse, managing and situational awareness room, engine and power control room, and combat information center with a large 360-degree circular screen wall. It can display panoramic views around the ship without a blind spot on the screen, and also utilized the augmented reality technology to discriminate the objects and navigate the ship.JMSDF Future Frigate To Feature Futuristic 360° Augmented Reality Wall - Naval News, 28 May 2019  Export  Both frigate designs has been showcased in four naval exhibitions to attract potential export customers. The 30FF has been shown in PACIFIC 2015 as a contender for Australian Navy's SEA5000 ASW Frigate Program and in Sea Air Space 2017. The 30DX design has been shown in Sea Air Space 2018(as well as 2019) and Euronaval 2018.

Hendley (1881-1962) was a teacher, education reformer, union activist, and president of the New York City Teachers Union (TU) from 1935 to 1945 (just after a minority split off to form the New York City Teachers Guild). Background Charles James Hendley was born on June 4, 1881, in North Carolina. His father was Alvis Francis Hendley, section foreman on the Southern Railway. In 1905, he graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Later, he earned an MA from Columbia University. Career Teacher Initially, Hendley taught in North Carolina. In 1915, he moved north. In 1919, Hendley helped organize a local of the American Federation of Teachers in Paterson, New Jersey. In 1920, he taught labor classes for Pennsylvania's State Federation of Labor in Bethlehem, Reading, and Lancaster. In New York, he taught labor classes for Local 3 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union and for a local union of telegraphers. From 1921 to 1946, Hendley taught history and economics at George Washington High School. Union activist In 1921, Hendley also joined the Teachers Union. From 1922 to 1932, he served as TU treasurer. In 1935, just as the Teachers Guild was splitting away, Hendley was the only executive leader to remain with the TU. He became TU president until his retirement from teaching in 1945 (or 1946 or 1947). In 1936, he advocated for the college and high school unionization of teachers and for collective bargaining rights of teachers. In 1937, the Socialist Party asked Hendley not to run again: Hendley won 3,333 votes of 3,411. His secretary at the TU was Dorothy Wallace, who was the sister of Dale Zysman, TU vice president. During his tenure as president, the Central Trades and Labor Council expelled the TU (and the ILGWU, as Hendley pointed out during testimony in 1952). the American Federation of Labor also expelled the TU while he was president. After retirement, Hendley served on TU's Executive Board, on its Educational Policies Committee, and as director of the Teachers Union Institute. He remained a TU member until his death in 1965. In 1946, Hendley became a field representative of the National Teachers Division of the United Public Workers of America (UPWA/CIO) through 1948. In 1951, he became both stockholder in and Secretary-Treasurer of Publishers New Press, Inc., publisher of CPUSA's official newspaper, the Daily Worker. He signed the incorporation papers. Politician From \\"early years as a teacher,\\" Hendley was member of the Socialist Party of America through 1938. At an unspecified date, he grew \\"closer to the Communist Party of the USA.\\" However, while Bella Dodd was a member of the CPUSA in the 1940s through her expulsion in 1949, she testified that Hendley was not a Communist but a Socialist. Hendley was a member of the Communist-affiliated American Labor Party. In 1948 he ran for State Senate (28th District, Bronx). In 1950, he ran for U.S. Congress (25th Congressional District). Government investigations In 1940, Hendley appeared before the Rapp-Coudert Committee and refused to surrender the TU's membership list. In January 1941, however, he complied and supplied the list. (During committee hearings, former TU member Benjamin Mandel and professor Sidney Hook both testified that Hendely was a puppet of the Communist Party.) In 1952, as former TU president and current Secretary- Treasurer (and stockholder) of Publishers New Press, he was called before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee and refused to answer many questions. His attorneys were Harold Cammer (one-time partner of Lee Pressman and Nathan Witt of the Ware Group led by Whittaker Chambers) and Royal W. France. He did state that TU membership \\"at one time\\" was close to \\"10,000.\\" He conceded that the board of directors of the Publishers New Press controlled the editorial policy of the Daily Worker. Based on \\"40 years or more\\" of study, he stated to the subcommittee that \\"The Communist Party in America is absolutely independent of the Communist Party of Russia.\\" He refused to answer questions about Communist Party affiliation. The committee cited an article from the Daily Worker to list the board of directors of the Publishers New Press as of October 8, 1951: Hendley, Joseph Dermer (Furriers), Howard Fast (writer), Richard O. Boyer (writer), Arnold Donawa (dentist), Ulysses Campbell (dentist), Elliot White (clergyman), Helen Alfred (social worker), Vincent Provinzano (Furriers), and Alex Kolkin (ILGWU). Of Bella Dodd's assertion that Hendley's TU secretary Dorothy Wallace was TU vice president Dale Zysman's sister, Hendley first state \\"I think that is a fiction of Bella Dodd's imagination\\" and then stated \\"To my knowledge, she is not a sister of Dale Zysman... I am not intimately acquainted with her family.\\" In 1962, again because of Publishers New Press, Hendley was called before a Grand Jury inquiry and refused to answer questions. Personal life and death In 1916, Charles Hendley married Okla Dees of Grantboro, North Carolina; they had two sons. In 1952, Bella Dodd characterized Hendley as \\"a person with very definite views on the whole question of schools and socialists.\\" In 1962, Henley died.

Abraham Doras Shadd (1801–1882), was a free African-American abolitionist and civil rights activist who emigrated to Ontario, Canada, and would later become one of Canada's first black elected officials. He was also the father of prominent activist and publisher Mary Ann Shadd.  Personal and early life  Abraham Shadd was born on March 2nd, 1801 to Jeremiah Schad and Amelia Siscoe. Jeremiah Schad was a son of Hans Schad, alias John Shadd, a native of Hesse- Cassel who had entered the United States serving as a Hessian soldier with the British Army during the French and Indian War. Hans Schad was wounded and left in the care of two African-American women, mother and daughter, both named Elizabeth Jackson. The Hessian soldier and the daughter were married in January 1756 and their first son was born six months later. Sources dispute whether Abraham was born in Pennsylvania and moved to Delaware, or was born in Delaware. Abraham spent most of his early life in Wilmington, Delaware, eventually taking over the shoe-making shop his father Jeremiah had created. Shadd married Harriet Parnell in the early 1820s and together in 1823 had their first of thirteen children, Mary Ann Shadd.  Prominence in Civil Rights and Abolitionist Movements  By the 1830s, Abraham Shadd started to become more prominent in the abolitionist movement, using both his homes in West Chester, Pennsylvania, and Wilmington, Delaware, to provide lodging for fugitive slaves fleeing southern states. He was a prominent voice in the anti- colonization movement. Shadd was one of five black men at the founding of the Board of Managers of the American Anti-Slavery Society in 1833, as well as a prominent member of the Colored Conventions Movement, serving as a leading delegate in both the 1841 and 1848 black national conventions, both held in Philadelphia.  Life in Canada  While being a vocal critic of black colonization for most of his life, Abraham Shadd was prompted to move his family north to Canada West (Ontario, Canada) with the passing of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. Less than a decade later he would become one of the first black elected officials in Canada, being elected in 1859 to a seat on the Raleigh Township Council. Shadd became a very prominent member of his new Canadian community, creating a school within the Raleigh Township, as well as creating a loan system with his farm tools and equipment, in order to assist other farmers in the community. He also was a member and early trustee of the Prince Hall Masonic Lodge, which assisted former black slaves and freed men in their immigration to Canada West.  Death and Legacy  Abraham Shadd died on February 11th,1882, a very prominent and well-known man within Canada West and the abolitionist and civil rights movements of the 1800s. His prominence fostered a large funeral ceremony attended at Maple Leaf Cemetery by residents of Kent County, where he would be buried. In February 2009, he was commemorated with a stamp by Canada Post.  See Also  *Mary Ann Shadd *Eunice P.

Entry into pornography  Stone began working in the porn industry in 1993 after dialing a wrong number led to a sexual encounter with a porn actress known as Nasty Natasha. Stone was working at a law firm doing filing at the time but decided to try doing pornography at Natasha's suggestion. Natasha was his first pornographic partner.  Awards  Stone was inducted into the Adult Video News Hall of Fame in 2007 and the X-Rated Critics' Organization Hall of Fame in 2018. He also two Adult Video News awards for non-sex performances in Hotel No Tell in 2013 and Conflicted in 2018.  Non-pornographic career  In the later years of his career, Stone tended to act less frequently in pornographic films, and when he did find work, it was often in non-sex roles. He cited the use of erectile dysfunction drugs in the porn industry as the reason for his lack of offers. In a 2008 interview with Adult Video News, he described the autobiography he was working on as \\"It's basically about how the pill has changed the industry and basically how it cost me my career. I was one of the 25 guys in this industry who could naturally perform and once the pharmaceutical companies came out with the ED drugs, pretty much almost everybody could do my job.\\" Stone also began appearing as a stand-up comedian and discussed his porn career in his act.  Death  Stone died in his sleep at the age of 54 on September 13, 2018 in Santa Monica, California. The cause of death was later determined to be atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. He was survived by an older brother and two younger brothers, as well as a girlfriend of two years.

It is based on the hybridization of two complementary strands of DNA or RNA via Watson-Crick base pairing (A-T/U and C-G) and makes use of a process called branch migration . Although branch migration has been known to the scientific community since the 1970s, TMSD has not been introduced to the field of DNA nanotechnology until 2000 when Yurke et al. was the first who took advantage of TMSD . He used the technique to open and close a set of DNA tweezers made of two DNA helices using an auxiliary strand of DNA as fuel . Since its first use, the technique has been modified for the construction of autonomous molecular motors, catalytic amplifiers, reprogrammable DNA nanostructures and molecular logic gates . It has also been used in conjunction with RNA for the production of kinetically-controlled ribosensors . TMSD starts with a double- stranded DNA complex composed of the original strand and the protector strand . The original strand has an overhanging region the so-called “toehold” which is complementary to a third strand of DNA referred to as the “invading strand”. The invading strand is a sequence of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) which is complementary to the original strand . The toehold regions initiate the process of TMSD by allowing the complementary invading strand to hybridize with the original strand, creating a DNA complex composed of three strands of DNA . This initial endothermic step is rate limiting and can be tuned by varying the strength (length and sequence composition e.g. G-C or A-T rich strands) of the toehold region . The ability to tune the rate of strand displacement over a range of 6 orders of magnitude generates the backbone of this technique and allows the kinetic control of DNA or RNA devices . After the binding of the invading strand and the original strand occurred, branch migration of the invading domain then allows the displacement of the initial hybridized strand (protector strand) . The protector strand can possess its own unique toehold and can, therefore, turn into an invading strand itself, starting a strand-displacement cascade . The whole process is energetically favored and although a reverse reaction can occur its rate is up to 6 orders of magnitude slower . Additional control over the system of toehold mediated strand displacement can be introduced by toehold sequestering . A slightly different variant of strand displacement has also been introduced using a strand displacing polymerase enzyme. Unlike TMSD, it used the polymerase enzyme as a source of energy and it referred to as polymerase-based strand displacement. 400x400px  Toehold sequestering  Toehold sequestering is a technique to “mask” the toehold region, rendering its accessibility.. There are several ways to do so but the most common approaches are hybridizing the toehold with a complementary strand or by designing the toehold region to form a hairpin loop . Masking and unmasking of the toehold domains together with the ability to precisely control the kinetics of the reaction makes toehold mediated strand displacement a valuable tool in the field of DNA nanotechnology Moreover, biosensors based on toehold mediated strand displacement reaction are useful in single molecule detection of DNA targets and SNP discrimination.

Biography Born in 1902 in Baghdad to a noble family with many children. As a child, he was swept away by the music and melodies in the synagogue and built himself a qanun-like instrument against the wishes of his parents, who feared that music would disrupt his general studies and Torah studies at the yeshiva. At the age of fourteen, he joined a group of people who made a living from the songs of blessings on celebrations. At the age of eighteen he bought himself his first qanun and soon mastered the intricate instrument and began to play flute, violin and cello as well. At the age of twenty, he opened a school for various musical instruments that was very successful. Being such an expert in the vast knowledge he acquired and in his absolute pitch, his playing on the qanun turned from a popular tune to modern and artistic playing, and he gained a much respectable status in the music world of Baghdad. In 1931, he even participated in a performance by Sami Al- Shawwa, one of the greatest violinists of Arab music, and met the greatest composers and singers, Mohammed Abdel Wahab and Umm Kulthum, who came to Iraq. Zaarur was an accompanied player to the famous Iraqi singer Mohammad Al Gubenchi, and together they traveled to Berlin to record on records and recitals. Many of these were broadcast in Berlin on a station in Arabic. In addition, he and his band performed in Berlin to the Iraqi community there. In 1932, at the First International Congress of Arab Music in Cairo, the official orchestra representing Iraq in that Congress was conducted and directed by Yusuf Za'arour. He even won first place and received a medal. In 1936, Zaarour was appointed director of the musical department at the Baghdad radio station. The appointment was by then Prime Minister Nuri al-Said. As part of his work, he examined many musicians for the purpose of establishing three musical ensembles: Iraqi, Kurdish and Egyptian. As the editor of the music programs at the station, he examined many musicians for the purpose of integrating them in these programs and worked to integrate Jewish musicians. In addition, he established another band of Muslim musicians from Baghdad who played on Shabat and Jewish holidays. Outside his formal job at the radio station, he performed before the king, government ministers and the mayor of Baghdad.סיפורה של אספרנס מורדוך-זערור מעיראק, הסיפור נגבה ונכתב על ידי שרונה שלסקי במסגרת תוכנית “לכל איש יש שם” במרכז יום ע”ש מנדלבוים בהנהלתה של עדינה שץ, רמת-גן He had performed in Mandatory Palestine before the establishment of the State of Israel, in 1944, and returned to Iraq. In 1951 he realized his ambition to make Aliyah to the Land of Israel, despite his great talent and honorable position as director at the Baghdad Broadcasting Station. In 1956, during the Sinai Campaign, the BBC boycotted recitals of his that were recorded in Iraq for the station after World War II, because he was Jewish.

It suggests that in order for an organism to evolve a large brain without a significant increase in basal metabolic rate (as seen in humans), the organism must use less energy on other expensive tissues; the paper introducing the ETH suggests that in humans, this was achieved by eating an easy-to-digest diet and evolving a smaller, less energy intensive gut. The ETH has inspired many research projects to test its validity in primates and other organisms. The human brain stands out among the mammals because its relative size compared to the rest of the body is unusually large compared to other animals. The human brain is about three times larger than that of our closest living relative, the chimpanzee. For a primate of our body size, the relative size of the brain and that of the digestive tract is rather unexpected; the digestive tract is smaller than expected for a primate of our body size. In 1995, two scientists proposed an attempt to solve this phenomenon of human evolution using the Expensive Tissue Hypothesis.  Original paper  The original paper introducing the ETH was written by Leslie Aiello and Peter Wheeler. Availability to new data on basal metabolic rate (BMR) and brain size has shown that energetics is an issue in the maintenance of a relatively large brain, like the human brain. In mammals, brain size is positively correlated with the BMR. In the paper, they sought to explain how humans managed to have energy for their large and metabolically expensive brains while still maintaining a BMR comparable to other primates with smaller brains. They found that the humans’ smaller relative gut size almost completely compensated for the metabolic cost of the larger brain. They went on to postulate that a larger brain would allow for more complex foraging behavior, which would result in a higher quality diet, which would then allow the gut to shrink further, freeing up more energy for the brain. This research also presented a case for studying the evolution of organs in a more interconnected manner, rather than in isolation.  Further research  Anthropologists have been able to observe a dramatic contrast in relative brain size between humans and our great ape ancestors. Studies have shown that brain size differences underlie major differences in cognitive performance. Because of this, Brain tissue is energetically expensive and requires a great amount of energy compared to several other somatic tissues during rest. To understand how the body is able to provide the brain with the right amount of energy to function properly, scientists consider the cost side of the equation and focus on how brain and other expensive tissues such as the gut or the testes may trade off. Another possibility is that there may not be any trading off, rather there are other ways that humans are keeping the brain nourished. The academic debate around the ETH is still active, and has inspired a number of similar tests, all attempting to verify the ETH with another species or group of species by looking at encephalization (a ratio between brain size and body size), gut size, and/or diet quality. Primates, being the closest living relatives to humans, are a natural extension to the hypothesis, and as such are examined by many of these tests. One such study supported the expensive tissue hypothesis and found a positive correlation between diet quality and brain size (as would be expected by the original paper), but it did note that there were exceptions among the species tested. A broader study including primates and other mammals disputed the ETH, finding that there is no negative correlation between brain and gut sizes; it did, however, support the idea of energy trade-offs in evolution as it found a negative correlation between encephalization and adipose deposits. Studies have also been done in species less similar to humans, such as anurans and fish. The study of anurans found that among the 30 species tested, there was a significant negative correlation between gut size and brain size, as Aiello and Wheeler found in humans and primates in their original research. One study of fish used the carnivorous fish Gnathonemus petersii, which has a uniquely large brain, about three times the size expected of a fish of its size. The research found that these fish also had significantly smaller guts than other similar carnivorous fish. These further studies enrich the debate over the ETH. Another study done by Huang, Yu, and Liao investigated the possible effects of gut microbiota in the expensive tissue hypothesis among vertebrates. Researchers have investigated various symbiotic gut bacteria as well as other microorganisms that have coevolved in the human or other animals digestive tract. These microbiotas have evolved to form mutually and beneficial relationships with their host, they are important for immune function, nutrition and human physiology and any disruption in the gut can lead to gastrointestinal dysfunction like obesity for example. Several studies have also shown that the diversity and the composition of the gut microbiota vary topographically and temporarily. This is because specific bacteria have been linked to the host’s food intake as well as the use of nutrition and energy metabolism. Any changes or modifications of the microbial landscape in the gut can lead to several complex and dynamic interactions throughout life. Additionally, the choice of the host is strongly associated with the diversification and complexity of the microbial, for instance, the study illustrates that diet high in fat increases the level of Bacteroidete and decreases the level of Firmicute in children’s gut, the study also theorized that diet quality is also related to gut size. The study also found out that gut size has also seen coevolution in brain size, partly because both the brain size and gut are one of the most energetically costly organs in vertebrates body. Based on the expensive tissue hypothesis, higher energy expenditure of vertebrates with larger brains has to balance out by following a similar decrease in other energetically consuming organs; in this case, it's gut size. There has also been evidence that shows that vertebrates with larger brains have evolved to balance out the energetic expenditure required by trading off with the gut size. For example, researchers have found a negative correlation between brain size and gut size in guppies as well as Omei wood frog Gut microbiotata a responds to diet quality in a way that influences the metabolism of the host. For instance, improving energy yield in the host or altering the metabolic pathways is one of the main processes that drive the trade-off between brain size and gut size. This process is also correlated with the ETH hypothesizes because the brain size increases when energy input is at a high level due to consumptions of extra diet and the overall increase constant energy input. However, after several investigations, the study could not find strong evidence to support that brain size is negatively correlated to the gut microbiota in the vertebrates. A similar study was done by Tsuboi et al., shows clear evidence that the brain size is correlated with the gut size by controlling the effects of shared ancestral and ecological confounding variables. The study found that the evolution of a larger brain is closely related to the increase in reproductive investment into egg size and parental size. The result of the experiment concluded that the energy cost of encephalization might have involved in the evolution of brain size in both endothermic as well as ectothermic vertebrates. For example, the study found out that homeothermic vertebrae such as elephant nose fish, Gnathonemus petersii has a large brain that is related to a smaller intestine and stomach size. Which suggested that energy constraints on brain size evolution are found in at least highly encephalized tropical species. Additionally, the study found that the evolution of brain size is associated with an increase in egg size can lead to an extended period of parental care. This also shows that the presence of the energetic constraints of encephalization is also being applied to homeothermic vertebrates. Even though the study provided distinct evidence to prove that brain size and gut size are negatively correlated with one another, however, there wasn't strong evidence to prove that. For instance, most of the study done on the live-bearing and egg-bearing species within Chondrichthyans, cannot be generalized across all homeothermic and ectothermic vertebrates. Further studies did show that there is definitely a positive correlation between brain mass residuals and BMS residuals in mammals, but the relationship is only significant in primates. When considering the expensive tissue hypothesis, we also need to consider how the Energy Trade-off Hypothesis affects the body too. Animals could reduce the size of other expensive tissues in the body or reduce energy allocation to locomotion or reproduction. The study also found out that gut size has also seen coevolution in brain size, partly because both the brain size and gut are one of the most energetically costly organs in vertebrates body. Based on the expensive tissue hypothesis, higher energy expenditure of vertebrates with larger brains has to balance out by following a similar decrease in other energetically consuming organs; in this case, it's gut size. There has also been evidence that shows that vertebrates with larger brains have evolved to balance out the energetic expenditure required by trading off with the gut size. For example, researchers have found a negative correlation between brain size and gut size in groupies as well as Omei wood frog.

It was a significant temple, regarded to be one of the most important shrines of Athena in Ancient Greece. History The temple was said to have been built by Aleus, the son of Apheidas, from whom the goddess probably derived this epithet.Pausanias, Description of Greece viii. 4. § 5 The first temple burned down in 394 BC, and a second temple was built by the architect Scopas. The temple of Athena Alea at Tegea was an ancient and revered asylum, and the names of many persons are recorded who saved themselves by seeking refuge in it.Pausanias, Description of Greece iii. § 6, ii. 17. § 7, iii. 7. § 8 Among the famous people seeking asylum at the temple, Pausanis recounts Chryseis,Pausanias, Description of Greece 2. 17. 7 the Spartan Leotychides, and the Spartan general Pausanias: :\\"[The historical Spartan general Pausanias] did not wait to stand his trial, but was received by the people of Tegea as a suppliant of Athena Alea. Now this sanctuary had been respected from early days by all the Peloponnesians, and afforded peculiar safety to its suppliants, as the Lacedaemonians showed in the case of Pausanias and of Leotychides before him, and the Argives in the case of Chryseis; they never wanted even to ask for these refugees, who were sitting as suppliants in the sanctuary, to be given up.\\"Pausanias, Description of Greece 3. 5. 6 Structure The second sanctuary was a temple of the Doric order which in size and splendor was said to surpass all other temples in the Peloponnese, and was surrounded by a triple row of columns of different orders.Meyer, Gesch. der bildend. Künste ii. p. 99, &c.; Pausanias described the exterior: :\\"The modern temple is far superior to all other temples in the Peloponnese on many grounds, especially for its size. Its first row of pillars is Doric, and the next to it Corinthian; also, outside the temple, stand pillars of the Ionic order. [...] On the front gable is the hunting of the Calydonian boar . . . On the gable at the back is a representation of Telephos fighting Achilles on the plain of the Caycus.\\"Pausanias, Description of Greece 8. 45. 4 - 47. 4 The statue of the goddess was made by Endoeus all of ivory. It was described as \\"... made throughout of ivory, the work of Endoeus. Those in charge of the curiosities say that one of the boar's tusks has broken off; the remaining one is kept in the gardens of the emperor, in a sanctuary of Dionysos, and is about half a fathom long.\\"Pausanias, Description of Greece 8. 45. 4 - 47. 4 The cult statue was subsequently carried to Rome by Augustus to adorn the Forum of Augustus.Pausanias, Description of Greece viii. 45. § 4, 4 § 1 and 2, 47. § 1 The interior of the temple was described by Pausanias: :\\"The present image at Tegea was brought from the parish of Manthurenses, and among them it had the surname of Hippia (Horse Goddess). According to their account, when the battle of the gods and giants took place the goddess drove the chariot and horses against Enkelados. Yet this goddess too has come to receive the name of Alea among the Greeks generally and the Peloponnesians themselves. On one side of the image of Athena stands Asklepios, on the other Hygeia (Health), works of Skopas of Paros in Pentelic marble. Of the votive offerings in the temple these are the most notable. There is the hide of the Kalydonian boar, rotted by age and by now altogether without bristles. Hanging up are the fetters, except such as have been destroyed by rust, worn by the [historic] Lacedaemonian prisoners when they dug the plain of Tegea. There have been dedicated a sacred couch of Athena, a portrait painting of [the mythical princess] Auge, and the shield of Marpessa, surnamed Khoira, a woman of Tegea . . . [...] The altar for the goddess was made, they say, by [the mythical hero] Melampos, the son of Amythaon. Represented on the altar are Rhea and the nymph Oinoe holding the baby Zeus. On either side are four figures: on one, Glauke, Neda, Theisoa and Anthrakia; on the other Ide, Hagno, Alkinoe and Phrixa. There are also images of the Muses and of Mnemosyne (Memory).\\"Pausanias, Description of Greece 8. 45. 4 - 47. 4 Cult Two festivals were celebrated at the sanctuary: :\\"Not far from the temple is a stadium formed by a mound of earth, where they celebrate games, one festival called Aleaia after Athena, the other Halotia (Capture Festival) because they captured the greater part of the Lacedaemonians alive in the [historical] battle.\\"Pausanias, Description of Greece 8. 45. 4 - 47. 4 The priest of the temple of Athena Alea at Tegea was a boy, who held office only until reaching the age of puberty.Pausanias, Description of Greece viii. 47. § 2 Excavations The Archaeological Museum of Tegea narrates the history of the temple and displays collections from the excavations.

It is located at the square of Sievekingplatz in the St. Pauli quarter. The square is named after the first president of the OLG, Ernst Friedrich Sieveking. History and judicial district Originally the court was opened on 1 October 1879 as a joint \\"Oberappellationsgericht\\" for the Free Imperial Cities Bremen, Hamburg and Lübeck. Its predecessor was the joint Supreme Appeal Court of the four free cities of Germany, Lübeck, Frankfurt, Bremen and Hamburg, which was founded in 1820 and based in Lübeck. Lübeck lost its independence with the Greater Hamburg Act of 1937, became a part of Schleswig-Holstein and thus fell within the jurisdiction of the then OLG Kiel. In 1947, Bremen received its own higher regional court, which in contrast to the Hamburg-based is called \\"Hanseatic Higher Regional Court Bremen\\". The district of the Hanseatic Higher Regional Court (of Hamburg) comprises the territory of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg, with the exception of the area, which is incorporated by the State Treaty on the regulation of coastal waters and the Elbe estuary in the district court districts Cuxhaven and Wilhelmshaven, according to § 15 of the Hamburg Act on the Execution of the Judicature ActHmbAGGVG § 15 of 31 May 1965. On 17 December 1970, the Hanseatic Higher Regional Court was also given the jurisdiction as a court of first instance in state protection criminal cases for the territory of the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen, it was transferred in accordance with § 120 para. 5 S. 2 GVG (Judicature Act).§ 1 of Abkommen zwischen den Ländern Freie Hansestadt Bremen und Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg über die Zuständigkeit des Hanseatischen Oberlandesgerichts Hamburg in Staatsschutz-Strafsachen, HmbGVBl. 1970, p. 271. In cases regarding river transport, since 31 March 1984, the Hanseatic Higher Regional Court is as Maritime Court also responsible for the appeals and complaints against the decisions of the jurisdiction of the States of Lower Saxony, Schleswig- Holstein and the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen Maritime Courts.

The online news site was founded by regional reporters Karen Velie and Dan Blackburn in 2008 under the previous title, \\"Uncovered SLO\\", at uncoveredslo.com. The newspaper is generally abbreviated as CCN.  History  Cal Coast News was founded in 2008 by Karen Velie and Dan Blackburn. From its inception, the online paper emphasized independent investigative journalism and tackled controversies in local government and industry. Former Los Angeles Times reporter, George Ramos, who played a key role in the paper's 1984 Pulitzer Prizewinning series on Hispanics was an editor at Cal Coast News. Ramos was a professor at California Polytechnic State University when he died in 2011. In 2012, an article by Cal Coast News inappropriately cited sources referencing a contractor's employment history and accusing him of mishandling hazardous waste. In 2017 the publication lost the resulting libel case and was asked to pay 1.1 million dollars in damages. After the case ended, Charles Tenborg, the Arroyo Grande waste-management business owner who sued the paper, purchased the LLC for the paper. The LLC name had been suspended by the Secretary of State after the libel case and Tenborg registered the name himself. While Tenborg controlled the name Cal Coast News, he did not gain access to or control over the website where stories were being published, though rumors circulated that he and his co-claimants had taken over the paper. The case was being taken to the SLO County Superior Court in 2017. Subsequent investigations by the Cal Coast News into Tenborg led to claims that Tenborg had given false testimony during the libel suit. Tenborg tried to settle CCN's libel suit appeal out of court, but Blackburn and Velie rejected his demands. In 2019, the appeals court upheld the original libel verdict citing the lack of a full record of the original trial. Also as of 2019, Tenborg and his co- claimant Bill Worrell were under criminal investigation for fraud. As a result of the on-going controversy related to the libel suit and LLC purchase, former CCN editor Bill Loving and reporter Karen Velie left CCN to work for the Cal Coast Times. However, Cal Coast News remains active and continues publishing articles by writers Velie, reporters Josh Friedman and Richard Bastian. CCN is also known for their coverage of former San Luis Obispo County District 3 Supervisor Adam Hill, having written hundreds of articles that Hill claimed was false or misleading. In a 2012 interview with the New Times (weekly), Hill revealed Velie was his former student. He described Velie as someone who said \\"fabrications\\" and held grudges with anyone she tried writing a story about. Since the interview was published, Velie and CCN accused Hill of corruption, bribery with local developers and special interest groups, and personal and financial retaliation. The website accused Hill of backing the Tenborg libel lawsuit as part of \\"an undisguised effort to destroy the eight-year-old online news agency.\\". CCN was the first to report that Hill's office and home was searched by the FBI in early 2020. These events would be followed by Hill's suicide attempt. CCN implied the FBI raid and suicide attempt was linked to allegations they published that Hill solicited money from the marijuana and development industries. In August 2020, Hill was found dead at his home from a suspected suicide. CCN erroneously reported the cause of death was a gunshot wound. Critics speculated that Hill's suspected suicide was partly triggered by CCN's reporting. In 2019, Aaron Ochs, a columnist from Morro Bay and frequent critic of Cal Coast News, published a book about the website called Defamers: How Fake News Terrorized a Community and Those Who Dared to Fight It. In the book, Ochs alleged he was personally retaliated against by Velie and Cal Coast News contributors. Among other allegations, Ochs alleged that in 2014, Velie attempted to blackmail his former employer and threatened his family. Velie and Blackburn repeatedly accused Ochs of being paid by government officials to criticize them, referring to him as a \\"government troll.\\" In his book, Ochs detailed that in 2017, Velie attempted to file a restraining order against him for harassing and threatening her inside the San Luis Obispo courthouse. Ochs denied the allegations. In that case, the judge dismissed Velie's request, citing that she fabricated evidence against him. Also in 2019, a Cal Coast News reporter was temporarily jailed in the Geneva Airport for attempting to film people who were arriving to attend the Bilderberg conference. Also in 2019, Cal Coast News released video footage of a physical assault of a woman at a bar by a San Luis Obispo city employee. The employee pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor to avoid more serious charges, but CCN's release of the video led to local outrage and the eventual firing of the city employee. In 2020, CCN covered protests throughout San Luis Obispo inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement and initiated after the death of George Floyd, a black American man killed during an arrest after allegedly passing a counterfeit $20 bill in Minneapolis. Their reporting evoked criticism from protesters for the allegations and reporter publishing them. In Defamers, Ochs wrote that Friedman, who reported on the protests, had suspected ties to white supremacy organizations including Oath Keepers and Freedom Force International, a group founded by American conspiracy theorist and John Birch Society member G. Edward Griffin. Friedman has also identified himself as a special correspondent for InfoWars, a conspiracy theory website known for publishing conspiracy theories about the Black Lives Matter movement. Friedman linked to those organizations on his new-defunct website FreeSLO.com. In August 2020, Friedman accused Black Lives Matter protesters of planning to protest in front of the home of SLO County District Attorney Dan Dow. The website cited a flyer announcing the protest that did not identify the individuals or organization reportedly involved. BLM Community Action, a coalition group responsible for organizing most of the protests in San Luis Obispo, denied being involved in the creation of the flyer and denounced the protest at Dow's home. In late August CCN also posted several short clips of the protests, some of the footage filmed by Josh Friedman, onto a YouTube channel with less than 300 subscribers named CalCoastNews, the channel is ostensible associated with the website.

Education  Davenport studied the Natural Sciences Tripos at the University of Cambridge where she was a member of King's College, Cambridge. She remained there for her graduate studies, earning her PhD in 1987. Her PhD was in metallurgy, investigating the oxide layers that form on top of metals.  Research and career Davenport spent eight years as a staff scientist at Brookhaven National Laboratory, looking at synchrotron X-Ray techniques for corrosion and passivation of alloys. In 1995 Davenport joined the University of Manchester. She was Associate Editor of the Journal of the Electrochemical Society between 1995 and 1997. She has carried out several experiments at the Diamond Light Source and is a member of the I18 working group. She was appointed to at the University of Birmingham and looked at the relationship between alloy microstructures and localised corrosion chemistry. She developed X-Ray micro-tomography to study the growth of small cracks, allowing her to understand the transition from pits to cracks in metals. She studies the relationship between microstructure and corrosion in stainless steal, titanium and aluminium. She looked at the impact of grain boundary crystallography on intergranular corrosion. Davenport uses X-Ray imaging to study corrosion. This information informs life-time prediction models. She works with synchrotron facilities to develop in situ characterisation techniques to understand the mechanisms of corrosion. Davenport leads an Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) consortium to develop synchrotron methods to look at nuclear waste storage. She has served as an international consultant on nuclear waste storage. She collaborated with Owen Addison on how corrosion impacts biomedical implants. Her group monitor the atmospheric corrosion of stainless steel alloys and have found that morphology is very sensitive to relative humidity and residual ferrite. They identified how bipolar plates corrode in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells. Awards and honours In 2003 Davenport won the NACE International H. H. Uhlig Award for outstanding efforts in corrosion education. In 2008 she chaired the Gordon Research Conference in aqueous corrosion. She was made a member of the Innovate UK Advanced Materials Leadership Council and the Government of the United Kingdom expert group on materials science. She was appointed a professor at the University of Birmingham in 2015. In 2016 she delivered the Birmingham Metallurgical Association lecture.

Its role is to trial unmanned aerial vehicles. History The RAN established a Navy UAS Development Unit in late 2012. This unit was tasked with experimenting with a UAV to test the type's suitability and begin developing procedures. It began flying its first UAV, a leased Boeing Insitu ScanEagle, in March 2013. The Navy purchased two ScanEagles in June 2015, and the unit was renamed the Naval Unmanned Aircraft Systems Unit. Schiebel Camcopter S-100 UAVs were acquired in late 2016, and accepted into RAN service on 30 April 2018. 822X Squadron was formed at HMAS Albatross on 25 October 2018 by redesignating the Naval Unmanned Aircraft Systems Unit. The X in its title indicates that it is a developmental unit; this is the first time the Royal Australian Navy has used such a designation. The squadron's role is to experiment with operating UAVs and develop procedures for integrating them into the Navy. Upon formation, the squadron was equipped with Insitu ScanEagle and Camcopter S-100 UAVs. These are intelligence UAVs equipped with high quality cameras. 882X Squadron's title was drawn from the serial number of the Naval Unmanned Aircraft Systems Unit's first aircraft, a ScanEagle designated AV1422. As of October 2018, the RAN intended to trial the Camcopter S-100s and ScanEagles for three to five years, and purchase other UAVs in the 2022-23 financial year.

Family  Amphilochus was the son of Amphiaraus and Eriphyle and the younger brother of Alcmaeon.  Mythology  Eriphyle, bribed by Polynices with the necklace of the goddess Harmonia, persuaded her husband Amphiaraus to join the expedition of the Seven against Thebes. Amphiaraus, knowing that he would die in the battle, reluctantly agreed to go but asked his two sons to avenge his foreseen death. At Thebes, Amphiaraus ended up in combat with Periclymenus, a demigod son of Poseidon. He attempted to flee but the god Zeus threw a bolt of lightning which opened the earth beneath him, swallowing the Argive and his chariot. Amphilochus's brother Alcmaeon then slew his mother and exiled himself from the kingdom. As king of Argos, Amphilochus was sometimes named among Helen's suitors.Gantz, p. 566.Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3.10.8 After the Trojan War, he was generally said to have abandoned his former realm and to have eventually settled the territory along the Ambracian Gulf which became known as Amphilochia in his honor. Its capital was a second Argos, which is distinguished as the Amphilochian Argos.Thucydides, 2.68. (Others credit this settlement to his nephew.) In fact, the area seems to have been a non-Greek settlement that was later Hellenized by its Ambraciot neighbors (reference required). Like his father before him, Amphilochus had a reputation as a seer and was also credited with founding several oracles. The most important was at Mallus in Cilicia,Arrian, Anabasis, 2.5.9. although this also seems to have been a pre-Greek settlement. Another was the oracle of Apollo at Colophon in Lydia, which Amphilochus was said to have founded with his half-brother Mopsus, the son of Amphiaraus and Manto. Herodotus also credited Amphilochus with the establishment of Posideium on Syria's Cilician border.Herodotus, The Histories 3.91.7 Amphilochus was variously said to have been killed by Apollo or to have simultaneously killed and been killed by his half-brother Mopsus. Either story was also sometimes ascribed to his nephew instead.Pseudo- Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3.10.8 Notes  References  *Gantz, Timothy. Early Greek Myth.

Location  The site includes part of the former USS Lead facility along with nearby commercial, municipal, and residential areas. The site is made up of two areas called \\"operable units\\" (OU). Operable units are broken down based on how the land was used, in this case OU1 is residential and OU2 was industrial. OU1, is a 322-acre residential area that has East Chicago Avenue on the north, East 151st Street on the south, the Indiana Harbor Canal on the west and Parrish Avenue on the east. OU2 is the former USS Lead facility on 151st Street. At this time the EPA has not begun remediation on OU2, but has come to an agreement with the company to perform a remedial investigation and feasibility study.  Products  The USS Lead site began as a facility that processed and refined metals and chemicals, including lead and arsenic which are now the primary contaminants of concern for the area. Then the site was converted to a secondary smelter; where the facility began recovering lead from scrap metal and automotive batteries. The site had been owned by other similar companies prior to this that performed the same type of industrial work.  Types of contaminants  There are two primary contaminants on the site, those contaminants are lead and arsenic. These contaminants are widespread across the area and are found in the soil and groundwater. Exposure to these can cause a series of health related issues, especially in children due to their size and that they are still developing.  Hazards  Arsenic: Arsenic affects numerous organs and systems including- Skin, nervous system, respiratory system, cardiovascular system, liver, kidney, bladder and prostate, immune system, endocrine system, developmental processes, and even death. Lead: Chronic lead exposure can result in- increased blood pressure, decreased fertility, cataracts, nerve disorders, muscle and joint pain, memory or concentration problems, and developmental disorders in children.  Remediation efforts  The remediation starts with taking sample of the soil and ground water, from there workers will dig up and remove contaminated soil, about 2-feet deep, and replace it with clean soil, including 6 inches of topsoil. Then they will put sod on the clean soil. The soil will then be taken to a licensed landfill for proper disposal. The sites will then be monitored for additional hazards. All work will be done at no cost to the homeowner. The current status of the remediation is still underway, due to the size and other limitations such as weather it is unknown when the site will be completely remediated.

(Mitch) Freedman is an American librarian best known for his advocacy for socially responsible cataloging and library technologies, as well as for championing the cause of intellectual freedom. He served as president of the American Library Association from 2002 to 2003. Early life and career Freedman received his bachelor's degree from Rutgers University in 1961. He had a number of clerk and assistant jobs in libraries before receiving his Master of Library Science in 1965 from the University of California, Berkeley School of Librarianship. Freeman earned his Ph.D. in Library and Information Studies from Rutgers University in 1983. The early part of Freedman's career was primarily as a technical services manager, where he worked on the application of information technology to bibliographical control. He worked at the Library of Congress from 1965 to 1968 and Information Dynamics Corp from 1968 to 1969. From 1969 to 1974 he worked as director of the Technical Services Division at Hennepin County Library; there he instituted a policy of establishing non-pejorative cataloging and hired cataloger Sandy Berman to implement that policy. While at Hennepin County Library, Freedman also hired Michael McConnell after McConnell was fired from the University of Minnesota for being gay. Freedman worked from 1974 to 1977 as coordinator of technical services for the branch libraries of the New York Public Library. From 1982 to 2005, Freedman served as the director of the Westchester Library System; some of his accomplishments during that time include overseeing the computerization of the catalog of library materials as well as fighting legislation against Internet filters to limit individual access to websites. After his retirement from the Westchester Library System in 2005, he served as interim director of a number of small libraries in New York, including the Nyack Library and the Pound Ridge Library. From 2013 to 2015 he served as the director for the New City Free Library. Freedman was an associate professor at Columbia University from 1977 to 1982 and a visiting professor at Pratt Institute; he also taught as an adjunct instructor at Rutgers University. While at Columbia University he co-edited The Nature and Future of the Catalog (Oryx Press, 1979). Library leadership Freedman was one of the early activists in the American Library Association's Social Responsibilities Round Table. He served as president of ALA's Information Science and Automation Division (later renamed the Library and Information Technology Association) from 1977 to 1978. Before it ceased operations in 1999, Freedman was a speaker and consultant for the United States Information Agency, advising libraries around the world on collection development, resource sharing, cataloging, and other areas of library work. Freedman testified as a plaintiff in the 1997 lawsuit American Libraries Association v. Pataki, challenging New York's Internet censorship law, and was an outspoken critic of the 2000 Children's Internet Protection Act requiring the use of Internet filters. From June 2002 to June 2003, Freedman was the president of the American Library Association. During Freedman's presidency, he focused on improving library workers' salary and compensation, instituting the Campaign for America's Librarians and the Task Force on Better Salaries for Library Workers which created resources for helping library workers who wanted to address salary inequities. Based on the recommendations of that and other ALA committees a separate advocacy organization, the ALA/Allied Professional Association (ALA-APA), was founded in 2002. When awarded ALA's Joseph W. Lippincott Award in 2014, recognizing his distinguished service to the profession of librarianship, Freedman was highly praised: Since 2000 Freedman has been the publisher and editor-in-chief of The U*N*A*B*A*S*H*E*D Librarian, described as the \\"How I Run My Library Good\\" letter; he continued the newsletter after the 1999 death of founder Marvin H.

Scott Flood was a \\"colored school\\" teacher in Sacramento, California and later fought for equal education rights for all children in Oakland, California.  Early life and education  Elizabeth Thorn was born a free woman in 1828 in New York state. In New Bedford, Massachusetts, she received a good education, and married her first husband, Joseph Scott. In 1852, now Elizabeth Thorn Scott, she moved to California with her husband Joseph and settled in Placerville. Joseph worked as a gold miner and died shortly after their arrival, leaving Scott Flood alone to care for their son Oliver. Feeling that Placerville was not the adequate place for an African American widow and her young son, Scott Flood and Oliver moved to Sacramento, which had a sizable African American population.  Educator and activist  Arriving in Sacramento, Scott Flood attempted to enroll Oliver in the local public school but was unable to do so since public schools did not accept African American students, not by law, but by tradition. Thus, with the help of the local African Methodist Episcopal (AME) church, in May 1854, Elizabeth Thorn Scott opened, at her home, a small private school for non-white children on Second Street, between M and N Streets. In the small private school, Scott Flood was the teacher and received a salary of $50 a month, which was paid by the parents of the students attending the school. Scott Flood's school initially had only African American students, but before long, she began to take in Native and Asian American students as well. At that school, students were not only children. They ranged in age from four, to twenty nine years old. A few months later, the Sacramento school board decided to take over administration of the school but not to provide funding, and arrangement that Scott Flood accepted but without giving up her fight for equal rights for her students.  Activism and education in Oakland, California  In 1855, Scott Flood attended the first Colored State Convention in Sacramento. In that convention, African American activists from all backgrounds, strategized how to lobby California politicians for better representation and basic civil rights, such as the right to vote. During that year, she met her second husband, Isaac Flood. Isaac was a freed slave who had been born in South Carolina and freed at the age of 22. Flood was twelve years older than Scott Flood and also had a son. The couple and their two children soon moved to Brooklyn, California, a thriving small community near Oakland. By 1857 Scott Flood and Isaac opened a school for African American children at their home on East 15th Street. At the time, African American children did not have access to public schools in Oakland. By 1858, the Floods had three children, were involved in the community, and were one of the most prominent and progressive families in the area. That same year, they helped start the Shiloh African Methodist Episcopal (Shiloh AME) church, the first African Methodist Episcopal church in the area. In 1863, the church purchased an old 20 by 30 building and moved it to Second and Market Streets. The building had been an old school for white children that been abandoned. With that building, the Shiloh AME took over the school and used the building for church services as well as the school. Scott Flood continued to teach at the school until her death in 1867. The local school laws did not allow African American students into public schools until 1872, but in 1866, it opened up government funded schools for African American and other non-white children. The Shiloh AME school operated for ten years before closing its doors in 1873.  Death and legacy  Scott Flood died unexpectedly in 1867 at age 39. She left behind her husband Issac and five children. Although Scott never saw the desegregation of schools, in 1872 the city of Brooklyn began to accept African Americans in its schools following a similar decision by the Oakland School Board. That same year, Brooklyn was annexed to Oakland. Scott Flood's youngest daughter, Lydia Flood Jackson was one of the first African American students to attend Oakland schools in 1872. By 1875, all African American schools in the area were closed, and in 1880, the law was changed in the state of California outlawing school segregation.

Saphir partners  The research partners of Saphir (with the exception of LIENS) initiated the conception of Shabal and were later joined by partners of the research project Saphir2 who actively contributed to the final design of Shabal. Saphir (Security and Analysis of Hash Primitives) is an ANR funded project on hash functions. Saphir has started on March 2006 for a duration of three years and brought five partners together: Cryptolog International, DCSSI, France Telecom (leader), Gemalto and LIENS. Partners of Saphir2 come from both industry and academia; in addition to partners of Saphir, 4 new partners: EADS SN, INRIA, Sagem Sécurité and UVSQ joined and contributed to the project.  History  Shabal was an entry in the NIST hash function competition, where it passed to the second round, but failed to enter the final round. Shabal was not selected as a finalist mainly due to security concerns. Although the security of the full hash algorithm was not compromised, the discovery of non-randomness properties with low time complexities raised concerns among NIST's cryptographers about the possibility of more powerful attacks in the future. The name of the algorithm was chosen as a tribute to Sébastien Chabal.  Description  Shabal uses a mode of operation that can be considered as a variant of a wide-pipe, Merkle–Damgård hash construction. The internal state of Shabal consists of three parts, denoted as A, B and C. The keyed permutation of Shabal updates A and B using nonlinear feedback shift registers that interact with each other. The main loop of the permutation uses modular multiplication by three and five, modular addition, XOR, complementation, and AND operations. Shabal function mode of operation The chaining mode of Shabal works as follows: (A, B) ← PM,C (A, B, C) ← (A, C – M, B), (A ⊕ W, B + M), where M is the message block, and W is the counter. After processing all message blocks, three finalization rounds are applied in which the message block and the counter values are fixed. Two tunable parameters (p, r) are defined for Shabal, where p is the number of loops performed within the key permutation, and r is the size of A. The default value of (p, r) is (3, 12). Additionally, p and r should satisfy 16p ≡ 0 mod r. The same internal function is used for all output sizes of Shabal.  Output sizes of Shabal  Output sizes of Shabal, based on length of the digest are: * Shabal-192 * Shabal-224 * Shabal-256 * Shabal-384 * Shabal-512  Outputs of Shabal  Example Shabal hashes: * Shabal-192: CB6E700F CE4DCF97 D2BBBF00 0C5364FB B40C8732 0D733948 * Shabal-224: 14A6DD99 E8D207F9 F7187681 326F6930 8BCAAE00 25F4855F 3120BA43 * Shabal-256: C0088FDA 9ABA672A 79D0BD56 07AE488E 095E2114 06855B3B 1877A349 A2543F99 * Shabal-384: 3312DE9D DA850D91 03785C3A C611B112 5D1BCAFC 033755D2 3B8EE05E 15251E4E 636A724F F0A8E584 4AABEAAF 122FC0C4 * Shabal-512: C6168015 0A3F1FC8 688DD952 8E9E2FED 23EF9578 BCE2A7CB A5D80961 E6C9E632 9701A5A6 F037B89F 20C6C44E DC7931E7 2BB5AB82 B3ADCD32 9CE25056 22305E98  Security  * Various distinguishers have been proposed for the permutation of Shabal. Using cube testers, a statistical non-randomness property of Shabal's key permutation was described with time complexity 2300. * A rotational distinguisher to the keyed permutation of Shabal using 2171 calls was presented. The distinguisher is based on the observation that most of the operations in P preserve rotational relationships between inputs. However, the attack cannot be extended to the hash algorithm, due to the non-symmetric IV, the addition of the block counter and the existence of the finalization rounds. * Another distinguisher was presented, based on the observation that multiplication by three preserves the difference in the most significant bit with probability one. Using this observation, the authors presented a method to find semi-equivalent keys for the keyed permutation. Under the related-key model, the authors also presented a method that distinguishes P from a random permutation using a single query. The method can be generalized to any security parameter. The authors also presented a method to find pseudo-collisions and pseudosecond-preimages for a variant of Shabal in which the number of iterations in the finalization is 24N (N ≥ 2), instead of 36. However, this attack does not work for the original Shabal, since it is not possible to cancel out the differences when the number of iterations is 36. * Some non-randomness properties were shown for the keyed permutation P that are easy to verify. The authors proposed a simple method to find fixed points in P. The inputs to the permutation were selected so that they are not affected by the loops in the permutation. The method is independent of the number of words in A and the number of rounds; therefore, the method works for any choice of the tunable security parameters. The authors also showed a way to construct many, large multi-collisions, where the only difference is in the key input. * A distinguisher was presented over some of the biased output bits using differential analysis with 223 data complexity. * A low weight (45-bit) pseudo-collision attack on the Shabal compression function with time complexity 284 was presented. A preimage attack with 2497 time and 2400 memory complexity for Shabal 512 using security parameters (2, 12). * None of the distinguishers directly threatens the claimed security of the hash algorithm. Moreover, the designers have modified the indifferentiability security proof of their chaining mode to require weaker assumptions than ideal ciphers.

History  Because of Monge's achievements in the domestic league and national team, and with the national sporting games of 1997 in mind, the then president José María Figueres Olsen, with the minister of sports (in that year called National Sports Institute) named the stadium that was already in the José Figueres Ferrer Olympic Village in his honor.

Teams  For almost 4 years, the former club Brujas F.C. had no home venue, so they used the stadium as part of a list of rotating venues for their home games, including the Old Costa Rican National Stadium. In 2008 the club's owner and stadium investor Minor Vargas negotiated a 10 years contract for the use of the stadium as a home venue for the team including some infrastructure improvements for it; but his arrest in the United States brought financial troubles to the team that in 2011 was sold to the Spanish investor Juan Luis Hernández Fuertes and became Orion F.C.

The area is part of the Mount Rogers Cluster. Location and access The area is located in the Appalachian Mountains of Southwestern Virginia and Eastern Tennessee, about 1 mile northwest of Laurel Bloomery, Tennessee and 1 mile south of Damascus, Virginia. It is bounded by Tennessee Highway 91 on the east and Tennessee Highway 133 on the west. The Iron Mountain Trail, (FS 54 in Tennessee, FS 301 in Virginia) is a blue-blazed trail running through the center of the area from north to south. Road access into the area in Virginia is provided by Va 4042. An abandoned Forest Service Road 322 connects the Iron Mountain Trail from Backbone Rock in Tennessee. Boundary of the London Bridge Branch wildarea as identified by the Wilderness Society.The boundary of the wildland as determined by the Wilderness Society is shown in the adjacent map. Additional roads and trails are given on National Geographic Maps 783 (Mount Rogers). and Map 783 (South Holston and Watauga Lakes) A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wild land's coordinates in the upper right of this page. Beyond maintained trails, old logging roads can be used to explore the area. The Appalachian Mountains were extensively timbered in the early twentieth century leaving logging roads that are becoming overgrown but still passable. Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The London Bridge Branch wild area is covered by USGS topographic maps Laurel Bloomery and Damascus. Natural history The forest is dominated by white and scarlet oak. Yellow poplar is found at lower elevations, pitch pine on drier and disturbed areas, and chestnut oak and northern red oak at moderate elevations. London Bridge Branch in Virginia part is recognized by Virginia for its water quality. Wild natural trout streams in Virginia are classified by the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries by their water quality, with class i the highest and class iv the lowest.9VAC25-260-370. Classification Column.: 9VAC25-260-370. Classification Column., accessdate: April 23, 2018 London Bridge Branch is a class ii trout stream. Topography With elevations ranging from 2000 feet in the lower drainages to 3600 feet on the ridge crest, London Bridge Branch wild area is dominated by a mountain ridge with small, steep sideslopes. A diversity of geologic features is characteristic of the Southern Appalachian Mountains. Geologic rock types are the Erwin Formation with white, vitreous quartzite, interbeds of dark-green, silty and sandy shale, minor siltstones and very fine sandstone; the Hampton Formation with dark greenish-gray, silty and sandy shale, micaceous shale, numerous layers of medium-grained, feldspathic, and thinly bedded sandstone; the Union Formation, a sequence of grey feldspathic sandstone, arkose, conglomerate, greywacke, siltstone and shale, and greenish amygdaloidal basalt flow; and Shady Dolomite, a light gray, well-bedded dolomite with thin to medium-bedded gray limestone, and yellowish brown residual clays with “jasperoid” diagnostic. Forest Service management The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine the potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provided some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. London Bridge Branch was inventoried in the roadless area review, and therefore protected from possible road construction and timber sales. The forest service classifies areas under their management by a recreational opportunity setting that informs visitors of the diverse range of opportunities available in the forest. A large part of the area in Virginia near Beaver Dam Creek and Laurel Creek is designated “Eligible Recreation River”. A small portion on the east is designated “Backcountry-Non Motorized”, a semi-primitive 2 area. The Tennessee side is divided between “Remote Backcrouintry-Few Roads”, “Remote Backcountry, non- motorized”, and “Black Bear Habitat Management”.

Also known as the Great Bodhidarma, the work is a depiction of Bodhidharma, known in Japan as Daruma, a revered Buddhist monk of the 5th or 6th century. The original artwork was destroyed in May 1945.  Background  The Great Daruma was not Hokusai's first monumental portrait. In 1804, during a festival at the Gokoku-ji temple in Edo (modern Tokyo), he created a portrait of Daruma said to be long, using a broom and buckets full of ink.  Conception  Contemporary print, depicting Hokusai painting the Great Daruma in 1817 Hokusai made the Great Daruma in a courtyard beside the Hongan-ji Nagoya Betsuin Buddhist temple in Nagoya, Japan. The portrait depicted the head of the monk and his upper body swathed in flowing robes. It was drawn on a large expanse of paper, measuring , equivalent to approximately 120 standard tatami mats of each. The eyes were wide, the nose long, and the mouth across. The event was advertised in advance to draw a large crowd. Hokusai worked for hours adding bold lines of ink until the image was finally revealed when the paper was hoisted into the air using a large wooden beam attached to one end, like a gigantic hanging scroll, or the huge thongdrel thankas of Tibetan Buddhism (usually in silk appliqué).  Reception  As a result of this dramatic feat, Hokusai became known in Nagoya as \\"Daruma-sen\\", the Daruma master. The triumph brought greater attention to Hokusai, enabling him to sell more prints to the public, including prints of the Great Daruma. He published a new volume of his Manga sketches in 1817.  Destruction  The original artwork survived in Nagoya until May 1945, when it was destroyed along with the wooden temple building in the bombing of Nagoya in World War II. Contemporaneous promotional handbills survive, with some held at the Nagoya City Museum.

October Revolution Day (officially Day of the Great October Socialist Revolution, ) was a public holiday in the Soviet Union and other Soviet- aligned states, officially observed on November 7 from 1927 to 1990. For Soviet families, it was a holiday tradition to partake in a shared morning meal, and to watch the October Revolution Parade broadcast on Soviet Central Television. A holiday canon was established during the Stalinist period, and included a workers' demonstration, the appearance of leaders on the podium of the Mausoleum, and, finally, the military parade on Red Square, which was held unfailingly every year, and most famously in 1941, as the Axis forces were advancing on Moscow. October Revolution Day, which had been the main holiday of the year during the Stalinist period, gradually lost importance in the 1970s, falling behind the Victory Day and New Year celebrations and existing a mere formality. Soviet observances Civil-military parade History The 20th anniversary parade in 1937. Leonid Brezhnev and Dmitry Ustinov at the 1979 Revolution Day Parade celebrating the 62nd anniversary of the revolution. The first military parade took place on 7 November 1919 on the one year anniversary of the revolution. The parade in 1941 is particularly revered as it took place during the Battle of Moscow, during which many of the soldiers on the parade would be killed in action. In 1953, the parade took place as the first one to not be inspected by officers on horseback.https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/parades- nov7.htm The practice of foreign leaders began in 1957 with Mao Zedong attending that year's parade as part of a state visit, continuing throughout the next two decades with Ethiopian leader Mengistu Haile Mariam's attendance in 1980 and the leaders of Warsaw Pact and USSR-allied nations in 1967, 1977 and 1987. The 1989 parade was the first to have a drill routine by the massed bands take place. During the final parade in 1990, an assassination attempt was made on the life of President Mikhail Gorbachev, attempt to kill President by Alexander Shmonov, a locksmith from Leningrad. The two bullets he fired missed as he was tackled to the ground by crowds of demonstrators. The only time that a Soviet leader never attended a parade was in 1983 when Yuri Andropov did not attend the parade due to a sickness and his associate Konstantin Chernenko stood in for him. Description of the parade The most important event of the holiday is the national military parade and demonstrations on Moscow's Red Square, with members of the Politburo and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union acting as the guests of honor. The celebrations begin at 9:50 am Moscow Standard Time with the arrival honors for the commander of the parade, who is greeted by the commandant of the Frunze Military Academy (now the Combined Arms Academy of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation) usually a general officer, and receives the report on the parade's status. Once the parade commander (who is usually a Colonel General with the billet of Commander of the Moscow Military District) receives the report, he takes his position in the parade and orders the formations to stand at ease. A couple minutes later, a Communist Party and government delegation arrives at the grandstand on top of Lenin's Mausoleum. The dignitaries include the General Secretary, Premier, the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, members of the entire Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, including members from the Politburo and Secretariat, the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, service branch commanders, deputy defence ministers, members of the cabinet and commanders of the support departments in the general staff, in addition to the occasional foreign head of state or party as the principal foreign guest and reviewing officer. In between the south of the grandstand is a platoon of the armed linemen and markers from the Independent Commandant's Regiment in military overcoats whose purpose is to take post to mark the distance of the troops marching past. Seated in the stands on the west and east sides were residents of the capital, visitors from all over the Union, the diplomatic corps and military attaches and guests from allied and friendly countries with ties to the Union government. Within Red Square the more than 9,000 strong parade formation (11,000 during jubilee years) was complemented by the Massed Bands of the Moscow Garrison, conducted by the Senior Director of Music of the Military Band Service of the Armed Forces, the billet of an officer who usually held major general rank, at the start of the parade the bands were split into four sections across the expanse of the Square in between the inspecting formations. The mobile column, also present, was made up of around 170-380 vehicles and around 3,900 crews drawn from the participant units making up the segment of the parade. Until 1974 the mobile column was around 400 to 680 vehicles strong made up of around 7,500 to 8,600 crews and officers from the formations making up the column. = Badges = In November 1967 Minister of Defense Marshal Andrei Grechkov announced his gratitude and of the Ministry of Defence to all those who marched on Red Square that 7 November as the country marked the golden jubilee anniversary year of the Revolution and for the first time, together with the text of gratitude, they were presented with commemorative badges \\"Participant of the military parade\\". Participants were also awarded a commemorative badge in the 1972 parade, the 100th parade to mark the golden jubilee of the foundation of the Soviet Union. A number of naval schools had custom made badges made in honor of their participation in the celebrations.  Parade proper  The Leningrad parade in 1983. As the Kremlin's Spasskaya Tower sounds the chimes at 10am the parade commander orders the parade to present arms and look to the left for inspection. The Minister of Defence (usually a billet of a General of the Army) then is driven on a limousine to the center of the square to receive the parade report from the commander, with the combined bands playing Jubillee March of the Red Army in the background. Once the report is received, the Minister and the parade commander begin to inspect the parading formations together with the bands. The limousinesed stop at each formation in order for the minister to send his greeting to the contingents, in which they respond with a threefold \\"Ura\\" (Russian: Ура). Other than the Red Square inspection, the commander and the minister would also inspect the personnel of the mobile column on Manezhnaya Square. After the final greeting, the Massed Bands played Long Live our State by Boris Alexandrovich Alexandrov as the commander returns to his place in the parade, and the Minister driven to the grandstand while the entire parade shouts 'Ura!' (Russian: Ура!) repeatedly until he takes his position in the grandstand and the bands end playing (from 1945 to 1966 Slavsya from A Life for the Tsar took its place and yet again in 1990). During this time, the Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Music College, which is an affiliate of the Suvorov Military Schools, take their place behind the parade commander's limousine. The parade is then ordered to stand at ease and the chromatic fanfare trumpeters, together with the rest of the musicians of the massed bands, sound a fanfare call, usually Govovin's Moscow Fanfare for the keynote address by the minister which will follow. As the minister concludes his address, he will yell \\"Ura!\\" (Russian: \\"Ура!\\") to which the entire parade repeats thrice. The Massed Bands of the Moscow Garrison then play the full version of the State Anthem of the Soviet Union while a ceremonial battery armed with the 76 mm divisional gun M1942 (ZiS-3) fire a 21-gun salute. As the anthem ends, the bands sound a second fanfare and the parade commander orders the parade to do carry out the following commands for the march past: ::Parade... attention! Ceremonial march past! Form battalions! Distance by a single lineman! First battalion will remain in the right, remainder... left.. turn! Slope.. arms! Eyes to the right... Quick march! On the command \\"Quick march!\\", the linemen take their places at the south end of the square while the Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Music College march to a drum tune, while the fifers and trumpeters play a specific tune, in a tradition that would go on until the late 1990s and early 2000s when the trumpets were removed. As the massed bands start playing the Corps of Drums begin to swing their drumsticks while on the eyes right led by the drum major. The Corps is immediately followed by the officers of the Frunze Military Academy whereas on jubilee parades, the massed colour guard is the first formation other than the corps on the square, followed by a historical contingent. The troops have always marched in the following order during the parade: = Order of ground march past column = Military Bands * Massed Bands of the Moscow Military District under the direction of the Senior Director of Music of the Bands Service * Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Music College Ground Column * Parade commander holding the appointment of commanding officer of the Moscow Military District * Color Guard Unit (in jubilee parades) * Historical contingent (in jubilee parades) ** Red Guards ** Ex-Imperial Russian Army servicemen within the Red Army ** Sailors of the Aurora ** Red Army soldiers during the Civil War ** Great Patriotic War contingent * Frunze Military Academy * V.I.

When the ground segment ends, the bands perform an about turn and march towards the facade of the GUM department store to give way to the mobile column, which drives past as the bands play Victorious March and Moscow Salute. Once the ground mobile column is complete, the bands take their position at the western end of the square to prepare for the finale, led by the senior director of music, conductors, bandmasters and drum majors. The finale involves the massed bands marching down the square to the tune of Song of the Soviet Army or Metropolitan March and as the bands march past the grandstand, the senior director of music, conductors and bandmasters salute at the eyes right. In 1967, the massed bands marched out to the tune of My Beloved Motherland. = Order of mobile column drivepast = * 2nd Guards Motor Rifle Division * 98th Guards Airborne Division * 4th Guards Tank Division * Moscow Military District Field Artillery and Rocket Forces * Moscow Military District Ground Forces Air Defense * 1st Moscow Air and Air Defense Forces Army * Northern Fleet and Baltic Fleet Coastal Defense, Surface and Submarine Forces (until 1974) * Strategic Missile Forces 27th Guards Rocket Army Similar parade events were held in all major cities in the RSFSR as well as in the USSR, with the first secretary of the local communist party branch being the guest of honor and the commander of the regional military district or large formation acting as the parade inspector and keynote speaker, while the second-in command of the unit or command served as parade commander. The parade format is the same in these cities, with particularities being shaped to fit the specific parade ground (e.g. October Square, Minsk). Massed bands for the parade were drawn from the formation or district bands located in their respective areas. The Government of the Armenian SSR cancelled the 1989 parade in Yerevan due to extended protests, while the mobile column of the parade in the Moldovan capital of Kishinev was removed from the itinerary due to protester blocking the streets and preventing passage to vehicles.file:///C:/Users/glaws_000/Downloads/Musteata%20Euxeinos%2015%2016_2014.pdf A similar occurred event occurred on what is now Gediminas Avenue in Vilnius.  Civil parade and workers' demonstration  Workers demonstration The bands having marched off the square is the signal for the commencement of the holiday civil parade and workers' demonstration in Red Square. In jubilee years (more frequency in the parades of the 1960s and 1970s), the civil parade kicks off with a spectacular march made up of the following components preceding the workers' demonstration march: * Red flag bearers * Historical segment (present in the parades of 1967 and 1987) * Officials, management, staff and employees of the Moscow City CPSU Committee and Moscow City Council * Representatives of state economic enterprises and firms in Moscow * Komsomol * Vladimir Lenin All-Union Pioneer Organization * DOSAAF * Color Guard, Athletes and Coaches from the Voluntary Sports Societies of the Soviet Union * Moscow National Central Physical Fitness and Sports School The logo of the 1987 celebrations. Float displays also featured prominently in the civil parades where floats were designed to promote government and party campaigns or highlight the works of various public companies, farm collectives and state economic firms. At a certain point during the civil parade, Pioneers in winter jackets and carrying flowers representing schools in Moscow and all over the country run towards the front of the Mausoleum facade and are split into two groups that ascend the staircases towards the dignitaries in the grandstand to give them flower bouquets. Following the civil parade the workers' demonstration officially begins, wherein workers from state economic and social firms in Moscow, as well as from schools and universities, march past as part of their respective community delegations. Each delegation has a color guard unit and brass band taking part, as well as floats from the participating state enterprises. Each of Moscow's districts march past the grandstand to greet everyone a Happy Revolution Day, especially to the dignitaries and everyone in the stands watching as balloons fly out from the crowds filing past while recorded music is played on the speakers. After an hour or two, the civil parade ends with a huge crowd bidding the principal dignitaries farewell from the grounds of the square with red flags in their hands as one final cheer resounds from the sound systems installed along the entire length of the square. Similar civil parades occurred in all major cities and the republican capital cities following the military parades. Post-Soviet observance CPRF celebrations in 2009. In Russia, the holiday was repurposed several times. In 1995, President Yeltsin reestablished a November 7 holiday to commemorate the liberation of Moscow from the Polish- Lithuanian Army in 1612. The next year, it was renamed 'Day of Accord and Reconciliation'. From 2004, November 7 became one of several Days of Military Honour and ceased to be a day off. The original celebrations continues to be honoured in the hearts of nostalgic Russians through ceremonies led by the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. As of 2018, October Revolution Day remains an official holiday in Belarus, though the original significance has faded and it is simply regarded as a day off. President Alexander Lukashenko has described the holiday as one that \\"strengthens social harmony\\".https://m.eng.belta.by/president/view/lukashenko-memory-of-october- revolution-strengthens-social-harmony-125652-2019/ Similarly, in the unrecognized Pridnestrovian Transnistrian Republic, the day is officially a public holiday, but it is regarded by locals as devoid of its original meaning. In Kyrgyzstan, the holiday was observed until 2017, when it was replaced by the 'Days of Ancestral History and Memory' on November 7 and 8.

Christ in Glory in the Tetramorph is a large tapestry by Graham Sutherland, installed at the north end of the new Coventry Cathedral in Coventry, England, as a focal point to the nave. It was unveiled in March 1962, shortly before the cathedral was consecrated in May 1962. The work measures , and is reputed to be the largest tapestry made in one single piece. The 14th century Gothic cathedral in Coventry was severely damaged in November 1940 by Luftwaffe bombs dropped during the Second World War. Rather than being repaired, the ruins were left as a memorial, and a new cathedral was built nearby. A competition to design the new building was launched in 1950 and won by Basil Spence with a modern style which included a tapestry behind the altar (sited at the north end of the cathedral, rather than the usual east end, as the new cathedral extended from the north transept of the old.). Spence was knighted for his work on the new cathedral in 1960. Spence originally proposed a Crucifixion scene for the tapestry, and suggested Sutherland on the basis of his 1946 painting in St Matthew's Church, Northampton, influenced by Matthias Grünewald's Isenheim Altarpiece. Sutherland had been a war artist in the Second World War, and was a convert to Roman Catholicism. In the event, Sutherland's commission in 1951 was for a tapestry of Christ in Glory. Sutherland continued to work intermittently on the commission for the next 11 years. The tapestry installed behind the altar, at the north end of the nave in Coventry Cathedral The tapestry depicts a seated Risen Christ, within an oval mandorla on a green background, surrounded by the symbols of the Four Evangelists: a lion for St Mark, an eagle for St John, a calf for St Luke, and an angel for St Matthew; these are the tetramorph (four shapes) of the title. For the symbols of the Evangelists, Sutherland sketched eagles and lions at Maidstone Zoo. The composition also draws influences from Egyptian sculpture, Italian mosaic, and images of Christ Pantocrator in Greek and Romanesque churches. The face of Christ is bearded, and is deliberately made more human than divine: it is based on several sources, including photographs of cyclists in Paris Match magazine. The Christ figure wears a white robe, and is sitting on at throne, face on, with both hands raised towards his face. Loops around the head suggest a halo. Between his feet is a life sized figure of a man, made diminutive by the colossal scale of the Christ-figure. At the base of the tapestry is a small Crucifixion scene. Many of Sutherland's initial studies and sketches are held by the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum in Coventry. Three preliminary cartoons, made in 1953, 1955 and 1957, are each high, approximately 1/10th the final size. The first has three panels at the base: an Annunciation, a Visitation and a Pietà. The second has Christ with arms stretched out to either side, and no mandorla, and three different panels at the base: an Annunciation, the Madonna, and St Michael fighting the devil. The third cartoon resembles the final work, with Christ seated on a throne and hands raised to either side of his face. A fourth and final cartoon was photographically enlarged in sections to guide the work of the tapestry weavers. At first Sutherland suggested that the tapestry could be woven by the Edinburgh Tapestry Company, but the work was eventually sent to at Felletin near Aubusson in the Creuse department of France. The French weavers, unlike those in Edinburgh, were able to make the whole tapestry in one piece, with a weave count of 12 warps per inch, using a gigantic 500 year old loom. It was made using undyed cotton warps and dyed wefts of wool from Australia. The pattern was built up using Aubusson tapestry techniques, using blocks of 900 different colours to create the different shades. A team of 12 worked on the tapestry for 2 years, under the supervision of Marie Cuttoli, and Sutherland visited 9 times to check and correct the work. The tapestry weighs over one tonne. According to the cathedral, it is the largest tapestry made in one single piece. However, the Guinness Book of Records lists a 2018 tapestry in Peru, at , as the largest. In 2015, it underwent surface cleaning and minor repairs.

It is one of the most common urban mosses of inner cities and can be easily recognized without a microscope. B. argenteum growing in the cracks of a car window Description The species is silvery-green or whitish-green colored when dry. This is because the broadly ovate shaped single leaflets in the tip do not form chlorophyll. The costa extends beyond the middle of the leaf. In damp, undisturbed locations, the branches may also form a more horizontal growth habit. The upper cells of the leaf surface are elongated rhomboid shaped. The capsule of the sporophyte is short cylindrical, appears broader at the base and is dark red to black colored. It has a high ability to tolerate drought and pollution of urban environments. B. argenteum is considered a desiccation tolerant species that can withstand total drying. While it is a common characteristic in mosses, B. argenteum was one of the first bryophytes experimentally determined to be desiccation tolerant.Gao B, Li X, Zhang D, et al. Desiccation tolerance in bryophytes: The dehydration and rehydration transcriptomes in the desiccation- tolerant bryophyte Bryum argenteum. Sci Rep. 2017;7(1):7571. Published 2017 Aug 8. doi:10.1038/s41598-017-07297-3 Distribution and habitat An adaptable plant, it has a cosmopolitan distribution and is found in Europe, North America, the deserts of Australia and in Antarctica. It thrives in areas of high anthropogenic activity, growing on rocks, in gaps of paving stones, on asphalt, and on roadsides. It grows especially well in inner cities or in industrial areas. Being a nitrogen loving species, it is also found on nitrophilic soils in urban areas. It is found growing among lawns as well as in other moss communities.http://rbg- web2.rbge.org.uk/bbs/activities/mosses/Bryum%20argenteum.pdf The species is often spread by vegetative fragments clinging to the shoes of people and the feet or hooves of animals. Another method of spread is in the production and sale of liners. Liners infested with B. argentem, often in association with Marchantia polymorpha, are commonly grown in one region of the country, transported to another region to continue growth, and are shipped to a retail location before being planted. Plants have the potential to pick up or disperse these species at each point of transfer.

She is recognized as venerable by the Catholic Church.  Biography  Childhood and youth Caterina Coromina was born in 1824 on a farm in the parish of Santa Eulàlia de Pardines, in a family of modest means. She did not attend school and spent her childhood working on the land with her eleven brothers. Her environment was strict and pious, which influenced her greatly.. Adult life She desired a religious life ever since she was young but was unable to because she lacked a dowry. In 1852, at age 28, family circumstances forced her to enter domestic service for the next nineteen years. At first she was employed on a farm; later she did the household for a priest, where she probably learned to read by way of The Imitation of Christ, a reading that allowed her to deepen her personal piety. Later she worked for various other families in Vic. Service to the poor, foundation of an order Caterina Coromina decided to stop working and fulfill her mission. She rented a place and began to live a religious life and minister to the sick, with medicine donated by the local pharmacist. Starting in 1877 she began to take in others, and with three women she began a communal life, founding the order of the Josephine Sisters, approved by the bishop of Vic, Mgr. Colomer, who became its spiritual director. The group experienced such poverty that the it fell apart, but it reconstituted itself after a year. The first religious vows were spoken in 1881, after which the community experienced growth and expanded throughout Catalonia—to Ripoll, Vilassar de Dalt, Manlleu, Torellà, Martorell, and Vilanova i la Geltrú. The arrival of new nuns who were better educated than Caterina Coromina caused some friction in the community beginning in 1886, and in the end the community's leadership was taken from her. She rededicated herself to poverty, and died in Vic in 1893.  Beatification  Her case for beatification was opened, and her heroism and virtues recognized. Pope Benedict XVI declared her venerable in 2006.

Factory label on August 29, 2006. It is a track-by-track remake of the 1971 Marvin Gaye album of the same name. Background and recording Marvin Gaye originally conceived of his 1971 album What's Going On as a response to the Vietnam War and the civil rights movement. The idea of remaking What's Going On originated with Shawn Amos, who was then the vice president of artists & repertoire at Shout! Factory. Amos had previously heard many stories about how most of the Dirty Dozen Brass Band's members had been displaced by Hurricane Katrina. While he was on a flight in October 2005, Amos listened to one of Gaye's songs. He subsequently sat down with the band and talked about what was happening in their lives. During this conversation, he mentioned the timelessness of Gaye's What's Going On album, and suggested that the band should cover it. The band's members decided that this would be a good idea, and initially sought to have Amos produce the album. Amos then called up his production partner, Anthony Marinelli, and the two of them went on to produce the album. The Dirty Dozen Brass Band's decision to remake Gaye's album was influenced by Hurricane Katrina, the government's response to the storm, and the ongoing Iraq War. The group's saxophonist, Roger Lewis, told NPR that he had been interested in covering Gaye's music for a while already, and that when Katrina hit, it seemed like the \\"...perfect time to do it\\". Lewis further explained, The members of the Dirty Dozen Brass Band were initially uncertain about whether they could successfully remake Gaye's highly regarded album. This was partly because they lacked a bass guitarist who could replicate James Jamerson's famous Motown-style electric bass playing on the original album. Instead, the band decided to develop their own style in which to play Gaye's songs. As Lewis explained to The Times-Picayune, \\"We don't play exactly like Marvin Gaye's arrangements. You're supposed to take the music to another level, and we came up with our own ideas about how to do it.\\" The Dirty Dozen Brass Band recorded What's Going On at two different studios: Austin, Texas's Bismeaux Studio, owned by Ray Benson, and Westlake Recording Studios in Hollywood, California. They began recording at Westlake with an attempt at recording their version of the title track from Gaye's album, featuring Chuck D performing his original lyrics. The band spent a total of three days recording at Westlake, where most of their sessions, according to Marinelli, focused on \\"conceptualizing and getting those basic tracks\\". They then traveled to Bismeaux Studio, where they recorded for five days using Pro Tools and the studio's Automated Processes, Inc. recording equipment. Next, they traveled back to Hollywood to mix the album with Pro Tools at Marinelli and Clint Bennett's Music Forever studio. Release What's Going On was released on August 29, 2006, on Shout! Factory, exactly a year after Hurricane Katrina first hit New Orleans and 35 years after Gaye's album was first released. Part of the proceeds from sales of the Dirty Dozen Brass Band's album were donated to Tipitina's Foundation. Critical reception Thom Jurek of AllMusic gave What's Going On 4.5 stars out of 5, concluding that it was \\"...the most fitting tribute yet to Gaye, because not only does it prove the timelessness of the music itself, it echoes that what is indeed goin' on (Gaye's dedication to Detroit as its decline became a reality with no onlookers interested in doing anything) is even more true today than it was in 1971.\\" Sam Chennault of SF Weekly also reviewed the album favorably, describing it in 2007 as \\"perhaps the most fitting tribute to the [Hurricane Katrina] victims\\" and as \\"alternately brooding and invigorating\\". The Washington Posts Mike Joyce gave the album a generally favorable review, writing, \\"The music, for the most part, is so ingeniously arranged that the album colorfully accommodates several guest vocalists -- too many, in fact -- without robbing listeners of the pleasure of hearing the band swagger and shout or slide into a welcome instrumental interlude.\\" Track listing Personnel *Shawn Amos – photography, producer *Revert Andrews – trombone *Clint Bennett – engineer, mixing *Beau Bonetti – assistant engineer *Carmen Borgia – engineer, music preparation *Doug Bossi – guitar *Chuck D – vocals on \\"What's Going On\\" *Gregory Michael Davis II – trumpet *G.

After the Australian premiere at the 2019 Sydney Film Festival, academic researcher Ingrid Matthews reviewed the film for the Australian Critical Race & Whiteness Studies (ACRAWSA) blog, writing, \\"Slam is a devastating film. Devastatingly good, devastatingly sad, and devastatingly accurate in its portrayal of racism in Australia.

You can’t turn away from it until the very end.\\" The film had a limited theatrical release in Australia on 17 October 2019 and received many positive reviews.

He and Võ Ðình Tú, Trần Quang Diệu, Nguyễn Văn Tuyết (Commander Tuyết), Lê Văn Hưng, Lý Văn Bưu, Nguyễn Văn Lộc (Commander Lộc) were known as \\"Seven Tiger Generals of Tây Sơn dynasty\\" (, ). Positions At first, Vũ Văn Dũng was subordinate of Phạm Ngô Cầu (the administrator of Phú Xuân appointed by Trịnh lord). In 1786, Tây Sơn army captured Phú Xuân, he surrendered to Nguyễn Huệ. He was granted the position Đại tư khấu ( \\"Grand Minister of Justice\\"). Later, he was sent to Tonkin to enlist rebel soldiers by offering amnesty. Conflicts After Nguyễn Quang Toản ascended the throne, the regent Bùi Đắc Tuyên, replaced him with Ngô Văn Sở, and called him back to Phú Xuân. On the way to Phú Xuân, he was persuaded by Trần Văn Kỷ to stage a coup against Tuyên. Vũ Văn Dũng, Phạm Công Hưng and Nguyễn Văn Huấn, besieged Tuyên's house, arrested him, and threw him into prison. Dũng then ordered Nguyễn Quang Thùy to arrest Ngô Văn Sở in Tonkin; In the same time, Huấn was sent to Quy Nhơn to arrest Bùi Đắc Trụ (son of Tuyên) in Quy Nhơn. Sở and Trụ were taken to Phú Xuân, and thrown into Perfume River together with Tuyên. The younger emperor could do nothing but weep. After the coup d'état, general Trần Quang Diệu retreated from Diên Khánh, and marched north. Finally, Diệu stayed at An Cựu. An army under Vũ Văn Dũng and Nguyễn Văn Danh also marched there to defense. A civil war might break out at any moment, which made the young emperor afraid. Later, the crisis was settled by mediation of Phạm Công Hưng; Diệu was persuaded to reconcile with Dũng, and came back to Phú Xuân. Dũng was granted the position Đại tư đồ ( \\"Grand Minister Over the Masses\\"), and became one of regents together with Trần Quang Diệu, Nguyễn Văn Huấn, and Nguyễn Văn Danh.Việt Nam sử lược, Quyển 2, Tự chủ thời đại, Chương 12Đại Nam chính biên liệt truyện, vol. 30 Nguyễn Ánh besieged Quy Nhơn in 1799. He was sent to reinforce together with Trần Quang Diệu. When marched to Thạch Tân, they found the road was blocked by Nguyễn Văn Thành and unable to reach there. The army under Dũng stayed at Chung Xá. In the night, a soldier saw a sambar deer pass by, and shouted: \\"con nai!\\" (a sambar deer!) It was misheard as \\" Đồng Nai!\\" (army of Đồng Nai!) by other soldiers, and shouted everywhere. The Tây Sơn army melted away in all directions, and was pursued by the Nguyễn army. Though they used to be political opponents, Trần Quang Diệu finally decided to conceal the fact. Dũng was thankful, and made friends with him. Hearing the news of defeat, Quy Nhơn surrendered to Nguyễn lord, its name was changed to Bình Định. Diệu and Dũng stayed at Quảng Nam. Trần Viết Kết and Hồ Công Diệu, spoke evil of Diệu, so the young emperor ordered Dũng to kill Diệu. But, Dũng showed the letter to Trần Quang Diệu. Trần Quang Diệu marched to Phú Xuân, the young emperor had to arrest Trần Viết Kết and Hồ Công Diệu and transferred them to Trần Quang Diệu. In 1800, an army under Trần Quang Diệu besieged Bình Định. In the same time, a navy led by Dũng sealed the Thị Nại Port. Getting this information, Nguyễn Ánh led a navy to reinforce Bình Định. In January 1801, Nguyễn army reached Thị Nại Port. Two Nguyễn generals, Võ Di Nguy and Lê Văn Duyệt, were vanguards to attack Tây Sơn navy. Võ Di Nguy was killed in action; Lê Văn Duyệt fought bravely, and set fire to Tây Sơn naval vessels. Dũng had to abandoned Thị Nại Port, and joined Diệu's army. Nguyễn Ánh left Nguyễn Văn Thành to fight against Diệu and Dũng, and attacked the capital Phú Xuân directly, and captured it. Diệu and Dũng planned to resumed the capital, but the road was blocked by Lê Văn Duyệt. They had to besiege the citadel more actively. The siege of Bình Định continued for over a year to June 1801, when the citadel's food provisions were exhausted. Võ Tánh, the Nguyễn general guarding the citadel, committed suicide. Tây Sơn army captured the citadel. The citadel was used as a base camp to attack Nguyễn lord. Capture and death 30 thousand men under the young emperor marched south to resume the lost territory, but was utterly beaten in the mouth of Nhật Lệ River. The young emperor fled to Thăng Long. Diệu and Dũng abandoned Quy Nhơn. They retreated to Laos, and planned to march to Nghệ An, then to the destination, Thăng Long. But Nghệ An was also captured by Nguyễn army.

Richards (February 16, 1892 - December 3, 1979) was a librarian who served as the president of the American Library Association from 1955 to 1956. Early life and career John Stewart Richards was born February 16, 1892, in Chicago, Illinois. His family moved to the Pacific Northwest when he was four years old, and he grew up in Yakima Valley. In 1912 Richards began his studies at the University of Washington; under the tutelage of University Librarian William E. Henry, Richards studied library science and became the first alumnus to graduate from the University of Washington Library School with an A.B. degree in 1916. His first job as a librarian was at the Marshfield Public Library from September 1916 to February 1918. In 1918, during World War I, Richards served as a librarian in the Library War Service at Camp Fremont. He subsequently held a number of librarian jobs, including positions at the Idaho Technology Institute from 1920 to 1923, the Washington State Normal School from 1923 to 1926, the University of California, Berkeley Library from 1926 to 1934, and the University of Washington Library from 1934 to 1942. Richards became the head librarian of the Seattle Public Library in 1942. Throughout his time at Seattle Public Library, he urged Seattle citizens to provide greater funding for the library, especially after the Carnegie-built Central Library was damaged and seriously weakened by an April 1949 earthquake; finally, in 1956, Seattle voters approved a $5 million library bond to replace the structure. Richards also strengthened the Seattle Friends of the Libraries group, with regular discussions geared towards community needs. During the McCarthy era, Richards noticed a list of \\"dangerous\\" books being distributed within the library; he argued that this attempt at censorship must be recognized for \\"the gangsterism that it is and must be combatted.\\" After retiring from Seattle Public Library in 1957, Richards taught at the University of Washington Library School and served on the Washington State Library Commission from 1959 to 1964. He moved to Carmel, California in 1964 and died during a visit to Seattle on December 3, 1979. Library leadership Richards served as a consultant for libraries throughout the Pacific Northwest and urged cooperation among libraries, enacting many cooperative innovations via the Pacific Northwest Library Association, especially during his time as PNLA president from 1937 to 1938. He was the president of the American Library Association's Division of Public Libraries (later renamed the Public Library Association) from 1949 to 1950. Richards served as president of the American Library Association from 1955 to 1956. Richards spent much time representing ALA in congressional committee meetings; during his term, the Library Services Act was passed into law, funding public libraries in rural areas.

In his lifetime, he was little known as a songwriter, but decades after his death by drowning at age 27, he was identified more widely as likely having written the lyrics to a dozen famous songs including two that were hits for Hank Williams: \\"Cold, Cold Heart\\" and \\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\\". He may have also written \\"I Overlooked an Orchid\\" which was a number 1 country hit in 1974 for Mickey Gilley (no relation). Other songs that have been attributed to Gilley include \\"If Teardrops Were Pennies\\", \\"Don't Let the Stars Get in Your Eyes\\" and \\"Crazy Arms\\". Gilley's contributions to songwriting are not widely known; he is not listed in the Oxford New Encyclopedia of Country Music published by the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, nor in Barry McCloud's Definitive Country encyclopedia. However, his hometown declared a Paul Gilley Day in 2012, and Kentucky historian W. Lynn Nickell has written a biography, Paul Gilley: The Ghost Writer in the Sky. Early life Gilley was born on a farm in the small town of Maytown, Kentucky, on October 1, 1929, the only child of father McClellan \\"Clell\\" Gilley (1889–1963) and mother Nora Alice Gilley (née Phipps, 1890–1958). He grew up a very tall boy, attending high school in nearby Ezel, where he wrote poetry – his friends said he was able to converse in rhyme. At 15, he published a poem in the local newspaper. He enrolled in Hazel Green Academy in Wolfe County, graduating in 1949. During this time, he joined several professional writing associations including the Poetry Society of America. Because of his height, Gilley played basketball in high school. He was listed under \\"Honorable Mention\\" on the All-State Basketball Squad in 1944. Starting in 1949, Gilley also played basketball for Morehead State College, and he wrote for the student publications Inkpot and The Trail Blazer. More information about this issue at Morehead's website. Promoter In 1949, Gilley began promoting bluegrass and country music acts, starting with a performance by the Stanley Brothers in Campton. Gilley apparently sold them his song \\"A Fallen Star\\" which was later recorded by Jim Reeves, Conway Twitty and Bill Monroe, though the lyrics were credited to James Joiner. The efforts of Paul Gilley Promotions were mentioned occasionally in Billboard magazine, for instance listing his 1955 clients as Lula Bell Si and her Country Folk, Linville Ball, Paul Hebert and Bob Nash. In 1956 he promoted Beverly Bresson. Songwriter Gilley was known to write song lyrics in high school. In his first year of college, he wrote an essay titled \\"Getting a Song Published\\", warning against the \\"song shark\\" who asks for payment from the songwriter. In the Morehead Inkpot, Gilley was credited as the writer of \\"Cold, Cold Heart\\", jokingly said to have been inspired by a basketball referee. Decades later, music journalist Chet Flippo wrote in 1981 that Gilley traveled to a Nashville bus station where he met Hank Williams to sell the songs \\"Cold, Cold Heart\\" and \\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\\". Gilley sold the songs outright because the one-time payment to him was higher if he allowed others to take credit. Historian W. Lynn Nickell wrote in 2012 that the bus station encounter was in mid-1950, with Williams curious to meet this young songwriter who had already supplied him with a couple of songs including \\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\\", and that Williams bought \\"Cold, Cold Heart\\" at the meeting. Gilley once wrote that it was \\"not too bad\\" being uncredited, since \\"you get paid for the lyrics—sometimes well paid.\\" Gilley was paid in the range of $50 to $400 for each song, equivalent in today's dollars to $–. Gilley wrote more lyrics than music, so to create songs he occasionally collaborated with composers. His collaboration with Carter Gibbs produced the song \\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry.\\" Another composer partner was Frank Kratz who helped with \\"Satan Can't Hold Me\\", recorded by Jim Reeves. Kratz recorded \\"Go Cat Go\\", a rockabilly song, and he co-wrote \\"Ooh So Nice\\", recorded by R&B; singer Johnny Adams. Death Gilley drowned while swimming in a neighbor's pond on June 16, 1957. He was 27 years old. His protective mother was shattered by the death, and she burned his papers, destroying much of the evidence of his songwriting career. In Billboard magazine, a Dallas music agent wrote to inquire who was handling the Gilley estate, as the agent was still interested in buying two songs written by Gilley and Kratz. Legacy Maytown, Kentucky, declared Paul Gilley Day on June 9, 2012, to honor the songwriter. At the same time, a new biography of Gilley was announced, self- published by historian W. Lynn Nickell as Paul Gilley: The Ghost Writer in the Sky. Nickell had gathered material from a wide range of sources, including handwritten lyric sheets in the possession of the son of Gilley collaborator Carter Gibbs. Songs *\\"Just When I Needed You\\", credited to Clyde Baum, Jack Anglin and Johnnie Wright. Wright and Anglin (billed as Johnnie & Jack) released the song in September 1949. Other notable artists recording the song include Little Jimmy Dickens in 1950 and Skeeter Davis in 1960. Gilley stated in 1951 that he wrote the lyrics while Baum composed the music, and that the song is \\"No. 118 in my folio of songs\\". *\\"They'll Never Take Her Love from Me\\", credited to Leon Payne. The song was first released by Hank Williams in 1950, with later versions by Roy Acuff, Johnny Horton, George Jones, and many more. Gilley handed the original lyric sheet to a neighbor girl, saying that the song would soon be heard on the radio, and that she should remember he wrote it. *\\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\\", co-written with Carter Gibbs, recorded in August 1949 by Hank Williams, who released it as a B-side in November. The Foggy River Boys covered the song the next year, with later notable versions from Marty Robbins (1957), Andy Williams (1959), Johnny Cash (1960) and Wanda Jackson (1965), among many others. *\\"I Overlooked an Orchid\\", is credited to Carl Smith, Shirley Lyn (the pseudonym of Troy Lee Martin), Carl Story and Arthur Q. Smith (the pseudonym of Arthur Pritchett). Carl Smith denies that Carl Story was involved. The song was recorded first by Johnnie & Jack in 1950, then in 1974 by Mickey Gilley to become a number 1 hit on the country charts. (Mickey Gilley is not related to Paul Gilley.) Paul reportedly played the song first for his college friends in 1949 or early 1950. *\\"Cold, Cold Heart\\", was recorded by Hank Williams in December 1950, then released as a B-side in February 1951. Other 1951 covers were made by Tony Bennett, Louis Armstrong, Dinah Washington and Petula Clark. Many others subsequently covered the song. Gilley was credited with the song in mid-1949, before Williams recorded it. *\\"If Teardrops Were Pennies\\" was first recorded by Carl Smith in 1951, followed by Rosemary Clooney the same year, Kitty Wells in 1958, and Loretta Lynn in 1966. It was recorded as a duet by Dolly Parton and Porter Wagoner, appearing on their 1973 album Love and Music. Troy Lee Martin copyrighted the song for Peer-Southern, but Nickell writes that Gilley sold the song to Carl Smith. *\\"Ashes of Love\\", credited to Jim Anglin, his brother Jack, and Jack's musical partner Johnnie Wright. Johnnie & Jack released the song in 1951. Several other artists covered it, notably Don Gibson, and a duet by Kitty Wells and Johnnie Wright. Nickell asserts that the lyrics were Gilley's. *\\"Don't Let the Stars Get in Your Eyes\\", credited to Slim Willet who released it as a hit single in 1952 under 4 Star Records. Ray Price reached number 4 with his country version, then Skeets McDonald released a western swing version. Perry Como enjoyed the biggest hit with the song in late 1952, gaining crossover sales to reach number 1 on Billboards pop chart. Other notable versions include recordings by Keely Smith in 1959 and k. d. lang in 1988. Gilley has been named as the writer of the lyrics. *\\"Crazy Arms\\", published in 1949 with credit given to steel guitarist Ralph Mooney and Charles \\"Chuck\\" Seals. The song was recorded by Ray Price in Nashville on March 1, 1956, with a 4/4 shuffle beat. The single became Price's first number 1 hit on the Billboard country chart, and established his unique sound. Price later said he got the song from a Tampa disc jockey named Bob Martin, in the form of an obscure record with a man–woman duet on the Pep label. After the song became a hit for Price, a California producer named Claude Caviness contacted Price to tell him that the woman singing was his wife, Marilyn Kaye, and that he owned Pep and held the rights to the song. Caviness and Price joined forces in 1959 to publish music under Caviness' reworked Pamper label, with artist manager James Harrell \\"Hal\\" Smith as the third owner. Among the many other cover versions of \\"Crazy Arms\\" are ones by Patsy Cline in 1964, Willie Nelson in 1970 and Linda Ronstadt in 1972. Gilley is said to have sold the song lyrics to Mooney, who wrote songs for Pep. *\\"A Fallen Star\\", first recorded in 1956 by Bobby E. Denton, later a state senator. Other recordings were made by Jimmy C. Newman, Ferlin Husky, Billy Byrd, Conway Twitty, Kitty Wells and the Jordanaires, Jim Reeves, Damita Jo, Jimmie Rodgers, the Cadets, Webb Pierce, Jan Howard, and B. J. Thomas. The lyrics are credited to James Joiner. *\\"When It's Springtime in Alaska (It's Forty Below)\\", credited to Tillman Franks and Johnny Horton, released by Horton in late 1958. Subsequent versions were recorded by Jimmy Wakely, Hank Snow, Johnny Cash and others. Historian W. Lynn Nickell attributes this song to Gilley. *\\"Me And Fred And Joe And Bill\\", explicitly credited to Paul Gilley and Billy Jack Hale, recorded by Porter Wagoner for release as a single by RCA Victor in 1959. Some years earlier, a live performance by Billy Jack Hale had been recorded, released later on the Bear Family box set Big D Jamboree, rockabilly recordings from the Dallas Sportatorium. *\\"Satan Can't Hold Me\\", co-written with Frank Kratz and Orville Stevens, recorded by Jim Reeves for the 1959 RCA Victor album Songs to Warm the Heart.

He was educated in Shanghainese Sign Language (SSL) in Hong Kong. When he arrived in Singapore, he noticed the lack of education for the deaf in Singapore. He approached the authorities to start a school but was not successful. In 1951, he began to teach sign language at his own home. In 1954, he and his wife started the first deaf school in Singapore, the Singapore Chinese Sign School for the Deaf, with the support of a few Chinese merchants. In 1963, the Singapore Chinese Sign School for the Deaf merged with the Oral School for the Deaf to form the Singapore School for the Deaf (SSD). Peng became one of the two principals and took charge of the Chinese Sign Section. The school closed in 2017 due to dwindled enrolment.

It had a population of 354 as of the . The name is derived from an Aboriginal word for \\"mountain\\" or \\"isolated hill or mountain\\". Bulga Public School operated from 1868 until December 1970. Bulga Post Office opened as The Bulga on 1 August 1878, was renamed Bulga on 1 January 1894 and closed on 2 July 1993. The village today contains the Regional Fire Service regional headquarters, National Parks and Wildlife Service offices, an Anglican church, a police station, scout hall in the former school building, recreation ground, service station and community hall. The community hall, originally a School of Arts, celebrated its 125th anniversary in October 2018. The Anglican church, St Mark's, holds a monthly service on the third Sunday of the month. The village shares a local progress association with nearby Milbrodale. Mining impact Bulga has been the subject of ongoing protests over several years from local residents around the impact of the expansion of the nearby Warkworth open-cut coal mine. The dispute has pitted angry local residents against business and mining interests, trade unions concerned about employment and the state government. Residents raised concern about the mine's expansion increasingly encroaching on the village, as well as concerns about road closures, 24 hour a day noise and constant coal dust. Residents attempted to challenge the mine's expansion in court in 2016, but were forced to withdraw when the state government acted to remove their right of appeal. By that time, the state's Planning Assessment Commission had suggested that the township be entirely relocated, and voluntary acquisition of some affected houses was underway. In December 2017, the Mount Thorley Warkworth Voluntary Planning Agreement was signed between council and new mine owners Yancoal, resulting in $6.6 million for a Bulga Community Project Fund to support the sustainability of Bulga and surrounds. In May 2018, Yancoal lodged an exploration license over additional land directly fronting onto the village outskirts. In August 2018, the mine won the approval of the Singleton Council to close the locally important Wallaby Scrub Road connecting Bulga to adjacent Warkworth, resulting in further community protest.

A career politician in China's Communist Party-run bureaucracy, Xing rose through the ranks gradually, capping his career as the top security official of Inner Mongolia. He was put under investigation for graft in October 2018, two years after he retired. At the time, he was serving as vice-chairman of the Inner Mongolia People's Congress. He was accused of taking over 400 million yuan in bribes, and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of commutation or parole. He had the dubious distinction of having the highest recorded corrupt earnings in the history of Communist-ruled China. Biography Xing was born in March 1952 in Tumed Left Banner, Inner Mongolia, China. He entered the workforce in September 1968, and joined the Communist Party of China in March 1981. During the Cultural Revolution, He taught at a school before going to Inner Mongolia University of Technology in September 1973. In December 1976 he was assigned to the propaganda department of local government is Tumd Right Banner. In September 1987, he was appointed deputy head Xiguit District, Baotou. In December 1990, he was head and deputy Party chief of Xiguit District. He served as mayor of Ih Ju League (now Ordos City) from January 1995 to October 1996, and Communist Party Secretary, the top political position in the city, from October 1996 to December 2001.

He was expelled from the Party on April 29, 2019. On August 15, 2019, the Dalian Intermediate People's Court opened in public to hear the case of Xing Yun. He had accepted properties and gifts either directly or through close relatives equivalent to 449 million yuan ($64 million). The amount set a record for the monetary value of suspected bribes or other ill gotten gains during the anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping. On December 3, 2019, Xing was sentenced by the Dalian Intermediate People's Court to death sentence with reprieve without commutation or parole when the sentence was automatically reduced to life imprisonment.

They are said to be one of the four largest houses of Circassians in terms of population. They are found all over the historical Circassia in the present day, in Adygea, Krasnodar Krai, Karachay-Cherkessia and Kabardino-Balkaria; as well as in Republic of Turkey and Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan due to Circassian Genocide. Etymology There are two distinct explanations of the roots of the surname. The first and the less famous explanation is that the word Тхьагъэпсэу comes from two different roots, Тхьагъапщ and псэу - Тхьагъапщ being the name of the village where the house had emerged and псэу literally meaning \\"to live\\" - translating as \\"Those who live in Tkhaghapsh\\". The widely accepted translation simply means \\"God bless them\\" in Circassian. It tells about the story of three brothers of House of Nartyzh living in the village of Tkhaghapsh, (present-day Tkhagapsh, Lazarevsky City District, Krasnodar Krai, Russia) where a tyrannical feudal prince ruled over the region. The three brothers decided that the reign of the prince must end and he must pay for the atrocities he had committed with his life. They ambushed the prince and killed him, therefore the residents of the region praised them with words \\"may God bless them, may God bless them\\" and it stuck with them as a nickname, later to become their surname. The three brothers later fled the region, each leaving for different parts of Circassia in order to avoid the vengeance of the relatives of the tyrannical prince who they had killed. One of them fled to Takhtamukay in present-day Adygea, one of them fled to Khabez in present-day Karachay-Cherkessia and the last one fled to the village of Kuba in present- day Kabardino-Balkaria.

The earliest known specimens of Ignacius come from the Torrejonian of the Fort Union Formation, Wyoming and the most recent known specimen of Ignacius was found in the Medicine Pole Hills (Chadron Formation) of North Dakota. Ignacius is one of ten genera within the family Paromomyidae, the longest living family of any plesiadapiforms, persisting for around 30 Ma during the Paleocene and Eocene epochs. The analyses of postcranial fossils by paleontologists suggest that members of the family Paromomyidae, including the genus Ignacius, most likely possessed adaptations for arboreality. Taxonomy There are currently four valid species within the genus Ignacius: I. frugivorus, I. fremontensis, I. clarkforkensis, and I. graybullianus. There are also at least two undescribed species of Ignacius from the Arctic of Canada. The type species for the genus Ignacius is I. frugivorus and was found at the Mason Pocket locality in Colorado. The holotype specimen (AMNH 17368), published in 1921 by Matthew and Granger, consists of an upper jaw with the canine, fourth premolar, first molar, and second molar. The genus Ignacius is situated within the family Paromomyidae and the order Plesiadapiformes. The relationship between plesiadapiforms and the modern group Euarchonta (Dermoptera, Scandentia, and Primates) is still under debate by paleontologists with some suggesting a closer relationship with primates, and others suggesting a closer relationship with dermopterans. The genus Ignacius was found to be synonymous with the closely related genus, Phenacolemur, by G.G. Simpson in 1935 but revived by Bown and Rose in 1976. Description Ignacius, along with the other plesiadapiforms, possess large, procumbent lower incisors convergent with those found in rodents, however, unlike rodents, the incisors of plesiadapiforms were not continuously growing. Most species of Ignacius have a 1.0.1.3 lower dental formula although some specimens retain a small P3. Compared with other paromomyids, Ignacius has small P4s in relation to M1s with relatively low crowned upper and lower molars. The lower molars have reduced cusps, forming an almost continuous crest along the talonid basin. The jaw of Ignacius is deep in comparison to tooth crown height, a feature distinct to this genus. Upper molars possess strong crests in a distinct ‘v’ shape between the paracone and metacone. Species Ignacius frugivorus was the first species of Ignacius to be described in 1921. Ignacius frugivorus and I. fremontensis are the oldest species of Ignacius, both found in the Shotgun Local fauna of the Fort Union formation, Wyoming. The youngest known specimen of Ignacius was found in the Chadron formation of North Dakota and is represented by a single P4 (2). There is not enough material to identify this specimen to the species level. Ignacius frugivorus and I. fremontensis are distinguishable from one another based primarily on the size of lower fourth premolars. Ignacius fremontensis displays a significantly smaller P4 in relation to M1 when compared to I. frugivorus. Ignacius clarkforkensis is the largest described species in the genus and differs from other species in the retention of a single rooted P2 (5). Ignacius graybullianus has more quadrangular upper molars whereas the other three species are more triangular. Strong v-shaped postparacone/prematacone cristae are present in I. graybullianus. These cristae are less obliquely oriented in the other three taxa. Paleoenvironment and geographic range Ignacius occupied a broad geographic range during the early Cenozoic era in North America, ranging from Texas, to the Canadian Arctic. During the early Cenozoic, North America experienced multiple climatic changes with the warmest mean annual temperatures (around 16oC, 60oF) occurring during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) at around 55 Ma. During the Eocene Climatic Optimum (c. 53 Ma) there was a correlated diversification of flora creating a complex, warm- temperate to subtropical habitat over much of interior North America. The environment of Arctic Canada would have represented a temperate environment with winter temperatures rarely dropping below freezing. The late Cretaceous and early Tertiary saw a diversification of angiosperms providing the opportunity for arboreal mammals to utilize the fruit, seed, exudate, and flower resources of these plants. The environment of interior North America, extending into the Canadian Arctic, would have provided habitable ecosystems for these arboreal mammals to thrive and diversify. Functional morphology Analysis of postcranial fossils of Ignacius suggest they were specialized for vertical climbing and clinging on tree trunks as well as for more agile arboreality than seen in other plesiadapiforms. Some researchers have also hypothesized based on analysis of hand bone morphology, that they possessed gliding adaptations like those of modern-day flying lemurs (Order Dermoptera). Further anatomical analysis of cranial synapomorphies, also suggest a close relationship between dermopterans and plesiadapiforms. Evidence for vertical climbing can be seen in the morphology of the humerus, femur, and tarsal bones which are consistent with increased flexibility of the shoulder, elbow, hip, knee, and ankle joints. These features also suggest powerful flexion of the digits for grasping large tree trunks as well as small diameter support branches. The features listed above are seen in many plesiadapiforms, but some anatomical features set paromomyids apart in being more adept for arboreal living. Flexible lumbar vertebrae as well as increased surface area on the innominate and femur for the origin and insertion of gluteal muscles, suggest paromomyids were capable of powerful bounding across tree branches. The large, procumbent incisors and reduced shearing crests of Paromomyids, especially Ignacius and Phenacolemur, suggest a diet specialized for feeding on exudates, comparable to the adaptions seen in extant callitrichine primates and Petaurus, a marsupial sugar-glider.

Geography Location Gongoni Danga is located at . Area overview Paschim Medinipur district (before separation of Jhargram) had a total forest area of 1,700 km2, accounting for 14.31% of the total forested area of the state. It is obvious from the map of the Midnapore Sadar subdivision, placed alongside, is that there are large stretches of forests in the subdivision. The soil is predominantly lateritic. Around 30% of the population of the district resides in this subdivision. 13.95% of the population lives in urban areas and 86.05% lives in the rural areas. Note: The map alongside presents some of the notable locations in the subdivision. All places marked in the map are linked in the larger full screen map. Entry point At the road level entry-point, one sees red rocky land that leads to a precarious drop to a valley below, where the Shilabati River weaves its way across the canyon floor. An array of jagged laterite cliffs are prominently visible. “Wind and water have collaborated over millions of years to carve and chisel a craggy ravine-filled landscape of forbidding splendour.” Locals call it Gongoni Danga or Gongoni Khola. The more imaginative city folk have christened it as the Grand Canyon of West Bengal. The local municipality has developed steps for visitors to go down through the gorge, several stories deep, the river has carved out over the years. As one descends the colours change to various hues of yellow. In the dry season, there is not much water in the river, but as the rains come, the river occupies many of the deeper parts of the canyon alleys. As one gets deep into the canyon, one gets a feeling of actual shapes and sizes of imaginary things. Some piece looks like a lion, another has look of a pagoda. There is a large cave with an interesting story. Mythology According to local folklore, the Pandavas, the central characters of the Indian epic Mahabharata, arrived at this place during their period of exile. The five brothers came with their mother Kunti. The land was terrorized by a demon named Bakasura. The fearsome demon demanded a person from nearby villages volunteer every day for his daily requirement of meat. The Pandavas were staying with a Brahmin family, and it was the turn of the latter to meet the demon’s demand. At Kunti’s behest, Bhima agreed to go. A fierce battle, lasting for several days, started and in the end the legendary hero killed the demon. The village folk believe, “And that earth-rattling battle left the land all wrinkled and crumpled,” and that according to some of them was how Gangani Danga was formed. Rebel stronghold According to Binoy Ghosh, when the Chuar rebellion started towards the end of the 18th century, the kings of Bagri were involved with the rebels, along with others like the Raja of Ghatshila and Rani Shiromani of Karnagarh. They were almost independent feudatory rulers in these areas and the British were the first to intrude into their freedom. Those who served under them did so on a hereditary basis. When the British tried to curtail their freedom, they revolted. It was a mass- revolt of enormous proportions. Ganagani Danga was their stronghold. The commander of the Bagri kings, Achal Singh, was the chief. The well-known Bagdi sardar, Gobardhan Dikpati, was his assistant. They fought on for a long time and stories about their guerrilla-type warfare and torture by the British still circulate in the area. In the early years of the 20th century, a person from Chandrakona published a novel “Salphool” about the happenings.Ghosh, Binoy, Paschim Banger Sanskriti, , part II, 1976 edition, pages 69-70 , Prakash Bhaban, Kolkata. Tourist spot Due to its scenic beauty, the place has become a popular tourist spot. The beautiful cannyon like formations attract people.

Though born to free parents, Hodges became an outspoken advocate for enslaved African Americans during the Antebellum period, giving aid to the Underground Railroad, collaborating with such notable figures as William Lloyd Garrison, John Brown and Frederick Douglass, and publishing an antislavery newspaper, The Ram’s Horn. Following the Civil War, Hodges was active in Reconstruction politics, attending the State Constitutional Convention of Virginia as a delegate from 1867 to 1868.  Birth and Early Life  Hodges was born in Princess Anne County, Virginia on February 12, 1815 to Charles Augustus Hodges, a free African American, and Julia Nelson Willis, a free woman of mixed-race descent. Charles was a landowner and a successful farmer, owning 200 acres of property and one slave by the time of 1840. While he would later come to be a forceful opponent of slavery, Willis's origins led to a lifelong concern for the free blacks in the South, and he dedicated his autobiography to their plight.  Antebellum Abolitionist  When Willis was fourteen, his brother William was arrested for antislavery agitation and thrown into jail. He escaped and fled to Canada, but the incident marked the Hodges family as pariahs in Princess Anne County, and young Willis found himself the victim of mob violence on more than one occasion during this time. Further discriminatory measures taken by whites in the aftermath of the Nat Turner rebellion caused Willis to leave Virginia for New York in 1836. At the instigation of his sister, Willis devoted himself to study, and he soon began attending antislavery meetings. Hodges quickly grew impatient with Northerners he viewed as being \\"more men of words than deeds,\\" and became an impassioned advocate for the immediate abolition of slavery by any means necessary. He started a newspaper, The Ram's Horn, in the 1840s, which soon drew him into collaboration with John Brown, the antislavery zealot who would famously go on to raid Harpers Ferry, Virginia in 1859.  War and Reconstruction  During the Civil War, Hodges served as a scout for the Union Army and used his knowledge of Princess Anne County and the surrounding area to assist Federal forces in its occupation. At the conclusion of the war, Hodges returned to his boyhood home and was chosen to represent Virginia at the constitutional convention of 1867-1868. The conventions of this period, mandated by the United States Congress, marked the \\"first time [blacks] sat alongside whites as lawmakers,\\" both in Virginia and throughout the occupied south. Hodges' leading role at the convention singled him out for ridicule in the southern press, which was often bitterly hostile to the role of African Americans in Reconstruction. Aligning himself with the Radical Republicans, Hodges supported the enfranchisement of blacks, demanded the disenfranchisement of former Confederates, and sought the racial integration of schools. When Democrats returned to power in Virginia, Hodges again went to New York in 1881, though he would revisit Virginia in later years.  Death  Hodges died on September 24, 1890, in Norfolk, Virginia. He was seventy-five.  References   Bibliography  Foner, Eric. \\"Blueprints for a Republican South: The Constitutional Conventions.\\" In Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 316-33.

The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  History of Glebe The Leichhardt area was originally inhabited by the Wangal clan of Aborigines. After 1788 diseases such as smallpox and the loss of their hunting grounds caused huge reductions in their numbers and they moved further inland. Since European settlement the foreshores of Blackwattle Bay and Rozelle Bay have developed a unique maritime, industrial and residential character - a character which continues to evolve as areas which were originally residential estates, then industrial areas, are redeveloped for residential units and parklands. The first formal grant in the Glebe area was a grant to Rev. Richard Johnson, the colony's first chaplain, in 1789. The Glebe (land allocated for the maintenance of a church minister) comprised rolling shale hills covering sandstone, with several sandstone cliff faces. The ridges were drained by several creeks including Blackwattle Creek, Orphan School Creek and Johnston Creek. Extensive swampland surrounded the creeks. On the shale ridges, heavily timbered woodlands contained several varieties of eucalypts while the swamplands and tidal mudflats had mangroves, swamp oaks (Casuarina glauca) and blackwattles (Callicoma serratifolia) after which the bay is named. Blackwattle Swamp was first mentioned by surveyors in the 1790s and Blackwattle Swamp Bay in 1807. By 1840 it was called Blackwattle Bay. Boat parties collected wattles and reeds for the building of huts, and kangaroos and emus were hunted by the early settlers who called the area the Kangaroo Ground. Rozelle Bay is thought to have been named after a schooner which once moored in its waters. Johnson's land remained largely undeveloped until 1828, when the Church and School Corporation subdivided it into 28 lots, three of which they retained for church use.City Plan Heritage, 2005, quoting Max Solling & Peter Reynolds \\"Leichhardt: On the Margins of the City\\", 1997, 14 The Church sold 27 allotments in 1828 - north on the point and south around Broadway. The Church kept the middle section where the Glebe Estate is now. On the point the sea breezes attracted the wealthy who built villas. The Broadway end attracted slaughterhouses and boiling down works that used the creek draining to Blackwattle Swamp. Up until the 1970s the Glebe Estate was in the possession of the Church. On the point the sea breezes attracted the wealthy who built villas. The Broadway end attracted slaughterhouses and boiling down works that used the creek draining to Blackwattle Swamp. Smaller working-class houses were built around these industries. Abbattoirs were built there from the 1860s. When Glebe was made a municipality in 1859 there were pro and anti- municipal clashes in the streets. From 1850 Glebe was dominated by wealthier interests. Reclaiming the swamp, Wentworth Park opened in 1882 as a cricket ground and lawn bowls club. Rugby union football was played there in the late 19th century. The dog racing started in 1932. In the early 20th century modest villas were broken up into boarding houses as they were elsewhere in the inner city areas. The wealthier moved into the suburbs which were opening up through the railways. Up until the 1950s Sydney was the location for working class employment - it was a port and industrial city. By the 1960s central Sydney was becoming a corporate city with service-based industries - capital intensive not labour-intensive. A shift in demographics occurred, with younger professionals and technical and administrative people servicing the corporate city wanting to live close by. Housing was coming under threat and the heritage conservation movement was starting. The Fish Markets moved in in the 1970s. An influx of students came to Glebe in the 1960s and 1970s.Murray, Dr Lisa. Central Sydney 5 August 2009. Rothwell Lodge Rothwell Lodge was built for Rev.

He was considered a leader in the African-American community, and made large contributions for their recognition. Despite his lack of education, Riley was active in political and business circles. His legacy was commemorated by a group named after him in Seattle, which is still trying to create affordable housing for different minorities.  Early life  George Putnam Riley was a native of Boston born on March 29, 1833. His grandfather was a participant in the Revolutionary War. Riley's father was engaged in the clothing trade in Boston. His mother was an active prominent abolitionist. Riley's education was hampered due to his African-American ethnicity.  Career  Originally living in Boston, Riley worked for one of the well-known lawyers and then for General Benjamin Butler. Then he moved to Portland, he had a barber position. Riley also became an active political and business.  Contribution  In 1869, George Riley Putnam together with several Oregon residents formed the Joint Stock Workers Association (WJSA) where he was appointed president. The organization acquired 20 acres of land in Seattle for donation, making this treatise called the “Riley Supplement to South Seattle”. The Association also acquired 67 acres of land in Tacoma, which was a major contribution to the African American community. Also, in order to draw attention to the important points of African Americans, Riley gave a lecture on April 26, 1870 on extending the voting rights of black men.  Heritage  In 2004, a housing and commercial development group in urban portals was named in honor of George Riley Putnam. The company has taken its roots since 1983 as a result of the activities of African American businessmen followers of Riley. References  Sources  *Chandler, J. D. Hidden History of Portland, Oregon.

It was built in 1890. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  History of Glebe The Leichhardt area was originally inhabited by the Wangal clan of Aborigines. After 1788 diseases such as smallpox and the loss of their hunting grounds caused huge reductions in their numbers and they moved further inland. Since European settlement the foreshores of Blackwattle Bay and Rozelle Bay have developed a unique maritime, industrial and residential character - a character which continues to evolve as areas which were originally residential estates, then industrial areas, are redeveloped for residential units and parklands. The first formal grant in the Glebe area was a grant to Rev. Richard Johnson, the colony's first chaplain, in 1789. The Glebe (land allocated for the maintenance of a church minister) comprised rolling shale hills covering sandstone, with several sandstone cliff faces. The ridges were drained by several creeks including Blackwattle Creek, Orphan School Creek and Johnston Creek. Extensive swampland surrounded the creeks. On the shale ridges, heavily timbered woodlands contained several varieties of eucalypts while the swamplands and tidal mudflats had mangroves, swamp oaks (Casuarina glauca) and blackwattles (Callicoma serratifolia) after which the bay is named. Blackwattle Swamp was first mentioned by surveyors in the 1790s and Blackwattle Swamp Bay in 1807. By 1840 it was called Blackwattle Bay. Boat parties collected wattles and reeds for the building of huts, and kangaroos and emus were hunted by the early settlers who called the area the Kangaroo Ground. Rozelle Bay is thought to have been named after a schooner which once moored in its waters. Johnson's land remained largely undeveloped until 1828, when the Church and School Corporation subdivided it into 28 lots, three of which they retained for church use.City Plan Heritage, 2005, quoting Max Solling & Peter Reynolds \\"Leichhardt: On the Margins of the City\\", 1997, 14 The Church sold 27 allotments in 1828 - north on the point and south around Broadway. The Church kept the middle section where the Glebe Estate is now. On the point the sea breezes attracted the wealthy who built villas. The Broadway end attracted slaughterhouses and boiling down works that used the creek draining to Blackwattle Swamp. Up until the 1970s the Glebe Estate was in the possession of the Church. On the point the sea breezes attracted the wealthy who built villas. The Broadway end attracted slaughterhouses and boiling down works that used the creek draining to Blackwattle Swamp. Smaller working-class houses were built around these industries. Abbattoirs were built there from the 1860s. When Glebe was made a municipality in 1859 there were pro and anti- municipal clashes in the streets. From 1850 Glebe was dominated by wealthier interests. Reclaiming the swamp, Wentworth Park opened in 1882 as a cricket ground and lawn bowls club. Rugby union football was played there in the late 19th century. The dog racing started in 1932. In the early 20th century modest villas were broken up into boarding houses as they were elsewhere in the inner city areas. The wealthier moved into the suburbs which were opening up through the railways. Up until the 1950s Sydney was the location for working class employment - it was a port and industrial city. By the 1960s central Sydney was becoming a corporate city with service-based industries - capital intensive not labour intensive. A shift in demographics occurred, with younger professionals and technical and administrative people servicing the corporate city wanting to live close by. Housing was coming under threat and the heritage conservation movement was starting. The Fish Markets came to Glebe in the 1970s. An influx of students came to Glebe in the 1960s and 1970s.Murray, Dr Lisa. Central Sydney, 5 August 2009. Monteith Monteith was constructed after 1890 as the home of John Henry (known as 'John') Cotter, his wife Margaret and family (they had six sons) who moved in after 1894 and continued to occupy the house until the 1930s when the land was subdivided. John Cotter died in 1922. Margaret remained, with her sister and two sons (including the eldest, William who had returned to live there after his own wife had died). Margaret was an artistic woman and chose quite soft colours for her home, not what are commonly thought of as the rather bald \\"Federation\\" colours often used today.Janette Smith, pers.comm., 2014 Four of their sons had died, two in World War I in Palestine (metallurgist, John, and \\"Tibby\\") and two (Lands Department cartographer, William and Tax Officer worker and athlete, Norman) through accidents. The house was a happy family home with many celebration dinners held in its time, mostly connected with \\"Tibby\\", the youngest son, and his cricket tours. Tibby was a stretcher bearer for the Australian Light Horse and was killed in the Charge at Beersheba, Palestine in 1917. Tibby's grave is well known to cricket enthusiasts. A biography of him, Tibby Cotter: fast bowler, larrikin, Anzac, by Max Bonnell and Andrew Sproul, was published in 2012. After Margaret died in 1936 (or 1938), the remaining two sons (William and Norman) lived there until the early 1950s. William died in 1950. His daughter was executirx and sold the house in to a confectioner. The firm Stuart Thom was involved but the house remained a private house for a time. The house was used for many years as a nursing training college and more recently as part of the College of the Arts under the direction of the NSW Department of Technical Education. The property was further subdivided in the late 1990s and the house bought by Glen Scott for conversion back to a single residence. In the 1970s there was more garden planting in front of the house and its colour scheme was closer to the original scheme. Conservation and protection The house now stands on a reduced curtilage, the State Heritage Register curtilage boundary following the present lot boundary. Structures not covered by the initial Permanent Conservation Order, such as the former Stables, were demolished as part of the redevelopment of the Allen Street and former Sydney College of Arts grounds. During its use as offices attached to a teaching facility only superficial maintenance was carried out by the NSW Department of Public Works & Services (DPWS). At the time of the sale to Mr Scott, areas of significant fabric were in poor condition with water egress. DPWS carried out repair work to the interior of the house prior to completion of the sale.Heritage Branch report, 2001 Previous approvals have allowed considerable subdivision of the property (since the Cotter family subdivided the Monteith estate in the 1930s, later owners subdividing it again in 1958) and redevelopment since 1971 (Nursing) and 1975 (Arts) for College uses with erection of three buildings to the rear. These rear buildings are student study rooms, an administration and lecture room building, a child care centre (converted former cottage) and outdoor play area, are respectively further west. All three have since been demolished. A heritage study in 1995 recommended retention of the remaining garden / rear yard curtilage, with no greater site coverage in buildings than then existing. It also recommended retention of the College lecture/administration building to the west, noting it provided useful living space on site, possibly in excess of what the then planning controls' would allow. After relocation in 1995 of the NSW College of the Arts from Monteith to the Kirkbride complex at Rozelle Hospital (Callan Park in Lilyfield), a rezoning application by the NSW Government in 1996 sought to rezone the site to allow residential redevelopment to the rear. Within the recommended minimum curtilage (from the 1995 Heritage Study) in the remaining rear yard/underground carpark area (at least) the former stables block, wood shed, a former barbeque area, a number of stone retaining walls and a minimum four trees have been demolished and removed from the rear. As already noted, the three College era buildings were also demolished. In August 1998, shortly after his purchase of the property, Mr Scott submitted a section 60 application to modify the existing multiple toilets on the first floor, create a large living area on the ground floor and kitchen fit out, repair the front verandah and repair exterior joinery. At that time the application was returned with the advice that he should first make an application for integrated development approval to Council. There is no record on file of such an IDA being submitted nor a following section 60 application. Approval and construction of an underground triple garage and garden pavilion (the latter has yet to be constructed due to protracted legal dispute) in the remnant 15m of rear yard will continue already substantial change the rear of the property. However these changes will be minor.Heritage Branch report, 2002 In 2002 approval was given to construct a new swimming pool and fence over the existing rear triple garage in a part of the site already highly altered (in levels, design and with at least one tree removed). No remaining garden elements were affected by this work. Only one remnant garden element, a curved path rear of the house was possibly affected, and the conservation of this element was dealt with by a condition of approval. A garden pavilion was approved on top of an existing triple underground garage (to block off a leaking proposed stepped access way to the garage). Construction of the pool allows some \\"residential\\" uses to occur in the rear yard, and proposed earth filling over the roof of the garage allowed the re-covering of exposed roots of a remaining fig tree in the yard. This will benefit the tree, which otherwise might be expected to decline in health. Both actions will help mask the garage from view from the house/garden, which of itself is considered beneficial to some understanding of the former garden/yard's character, albeit truncated by development further west.  Description  Monteith is a large two-storey brick residence situated on a rectangular land parcel on the western side of Glebe Point Road. ;Garden The established garden (chiefly to the house's east and north) includes a number of mature trees. The property has been much subdivided since the 1930s and sits on a reduced curtilage from the original lot. A small front garden faces Glebe Point Road, with mature trees and shrubs on the northern side of the house particularly. The house is sited close to Cotter Lane on the southern side of the lot, effectively \\"urbanising\\" this boundary space. A larger rear yard area remains but has been much modified over the years with additions, removals of stables block and other structures. The reduced curtilage and subsequent redevelopment of the former stables and rear yard areas as part of the adjacent development site has significantly impacted on the garden setting of the house at the rear and removed some significant garden elements. This has resulted in the property having a more urban setting at the rear. The rear yard does retain a curving brick path, a mature fig tree north east of the swimming pool and a nearby palm tree. A concrete deck roof to an underground garage is situated at the rear west corner of the site. The deck is set 1 metre below the natural ground level. ;House The house is built in the Federation Queen Anne style and situated from the Cotter Lane boundary. The house presents to Glebe Point Road with a rear wing extending along the Cotter Lane boundary.  Condition  As at 20 March 2012, (re 2002 rear swimming pool and pavilion approval) no archaeological impacts are foreseen, given the high level of site disturbance by previous redevelopment since 1971, particularly excavation.  Modifications and dates  * house built *1930s land subdivided. The house was used for many years as a nursing training college *1958 further subdivision *1971+ redevelopment (Nursing uses) and *1975 (Arts) College uses with erection of three buildings to the rear. These rear buildings were student study rooms, an administration and lecture room building, a child care centre (converted former cottage) and outdoor play area, are respectively further west. All three have since been demolished *1970s: the existing rear balcony which was constructed *More recently used as part of the College of the Arts under the direction of the NSW Department of Technical Education. *Late 1990s further subdivided and the house bought by Glen Scott for conversion to a single residence. The former Stables and other structures not covered by the PCO were demolished as part of the redevelopment of the Allen Street and former Sydney College of Arts grounds. * change of ownership and conversion *: rear triple garage built *2001-2: rear swimming pool built over roof of underground garage. The pool plant was located under the altered rear wing verandah. No details of the proposed pavilion were submitted for Robin Graham to make a proper assessment of the impacts of this structure, but he stated that any structure of a solid nature which impacts on ground levels in this area would not be supported as it has the potential to visually crowd the rear garden setting of the house and could result in the removal and obliteration of existing garden features. The rear boundary walls will need to be raised in height to at least to meet with the building code but this will have any impact on the setting of the house.  Heritage listing  As at 27 August 2008, the house Monteith and surviving grounds are significant both of historically and socially for associations with the Cotter family especially Australian cricketer \\"Tibby\\" Cotter, later from 1971 as part of the site of the NSW College of Nursing and the Sydney College of the Arts until 1995. It also has historic significance as a remaining one of a number of fine mansion houses along this part of Glebe Point Road. It has aesthetic significance as a fine example of its style and for the contribution it and its grounds make to the streetscape of Glebe Point Road.Robin Graham, 2001 Monteith was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

History  Color Factory was founded in August 2017 by event-planner/blogger Jordan Ferney, artist Leah Rosenberg, and designer Erin Jang. It originally debuted as a one-month, 15-installation, 12,000 ft2 exhibition in San Francisco, sponsored by Alaskan Airlines and Method Soap. Due to its popularity (at one point causing its Eventbrite ticketing page to crash from high demand), this San Francisco run was later extended to last for a total of eight and a half months. In June and July 2018, Color Factory partnered with the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York City to exhibit the “Manhattan Color Walk”, an outdoor art installation which painted the ground with several stripes of colors, each sampled from a different street of Manhattan.

It actively supported Circassia during the Russo-Circassian War and was dispersed throughout Ottoman Empire due to the mass expulsion of Circassians and the Circassian genocide. In the present day, members of the house can be found throughout the Tuapsinsky District, Krasnodar Krai, Russia and Republic of Turkey. Currently, none of the members of House Kuadzhe who live in Turkey uses their original family name due to the Surname Law of the Republic of Turkey as none of the ethnic minorities at that time were allowed to use non-Turkish surnames. Due to being spread throughout the Republic of Turkey and having no contact with each other, members of House Kuadzhe chose different surnames than one another. As such is the case with all other Circassian houses, – be they peasant, pirate, knight or prince houses – House Kuadzhe has its own banner, but as such is the case with some Circassian houses, it doesn't have one but three. This is usually due to the house being overexpanded and divided into smaller groups. Despite bearing the same family name, these groups chose different banners than one another, to avoid confusion. Etymology Traditionally, hereditary names of Circassians were associated with the name of the area, the origin of which was one of the ancestors or with the name of the ancestor. Later nicknames arose from the name of the profession, social status or the title of an ancestor. Most likely it seems that the generic name of Kuadzhe belongs to the oldest type of surnames that have come from the \\"geographical\\" name of the ancestor. This type of surname was formed from names given to ancestors in connection with their place of birth, residence or nationality. In the vocabulary of the Circassian language, the word kuadzhe () means hamlet. In most cases, kuadzhe was referred to the recently emerged settlement, which did not have an official name and people who emerged from it were not deep-rooted. Proceeding from this, it can be assumed that the name of House Kuadzhe was most likely obtained by a resident of such a village. It is possible that Kuadzhe was called an immigrant from a village who came to a neighbouring city for work or moved to the city for permanent residence.Бейтуганов С.Н., Кабарда: история и фамилии. At the same time, it is possible that the family name goes back to the name of the ancestor \\"Kua\\" in the Ubykh dialect (an extinct dialect belonging to Circassian language), given the location of House Kuadzhe's emergence. Thus, the surname of Kuadzhe, formed with the help of the family suffix \\"-dzhe\\", takes the form of a patronymic and relates to the son's family, pointing to the grandchildren of the originator of the family. Over time, the name of Kuadzhe became a family affair and was officially registered as a family name. The family accepting the personal nickname of the ancestor as its generic name means that the ancestor of House Kuadzhe was a great authority for the household, as well as a well-known and respected person in his native settlement.Баскаков Н.А., Справочник личных имен народов РСФСР. Since the process of formation of names was quite long, at the moment it is difficult to talk about the exact place and time of the origin of the name \\"Kuadzhe\\". However, we can confidently say that it is one of the oldest family names.

It was built from 1870 to 1879. The property is owned by the NSW College of Nursing. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  History of Glebe Glebe is now much altered from the environment which was home to Aboriginal people of the Guringai tribe for thousands of years and which Europeans first saw soon after the settlement was established at Sydney Cove in 1788. Blackwattle Creek and Blackwattle Bay were discovered and named in 1789. Almost half of the Aboriginal population was killed by disease within the first few years of white occupation and survivors, with their traditional life shattered and increasing pressure put on their resources, retreated away from the principal settlement. It is likely that the relatively untouched area of Glebe provided some shelter but there are no known Aboriginal sites on or near the study area. The area is based on a geology of sandstone with Wianamatta shale caps. The shallow sandy soil supported, on the ridge tops, robust forests of tall eucalypts and angophoras. Below was a shrubby under- storey that included acacias and banksias. The study area would have supported an environment of this type. Further down the ridges were black wattles, tea- trees and swamp oaks and these gave way at the marshy and muddy intertidal zone to mangroves. Blackwattle Bay extended in a rivulet to Parramatta Road, Wentworth Park occupies the reclaimed headwaters of this bay. Governor Phillip made the observation that this land was: The land was not suited to farming because of its topography and soils and the first European associated with it, the Reverend Richard Johnson, famously described his land as \\"four hundred acres not worth four pence\\". Despite its limited use for agricultural purposes the timber was a valuable raw material and by the 1820s at least a substantial portion of the land in the vicinity of the study area had been cleared and fenced ready for sale. In 1790 Governor Phillip reserved approximately of land to the south and west of Blackwattle Creek as a Glebe devoted to supporting the Anglican Church. Reverend Johnson set about clearing it. He had few convicts to do so and considered the land poorly suited to agricultural purposes. In 1974 he exchanged his rights to this land for a separate grant. The Glebe land appears to have remained relatively untouched from this time until the 1820s. In 1826 a Corporation was formed to administer all the lands reserved for clerical and educational use and income. This was the Clergy and School Lands Corporation. The Glebe land came under their authorisation as part of a Crown Grant made to the Corporation. The latter, being in a parlous financial situation, made the decision to sell this estate to generate income. The land was sold as two subdivisons at two separate auctions the second being on 7 May 1828. The Church sold 27 allotments in 1828 - north on the point and south around Broadway. The Church kept the middle section where the Glebe Estate is now. Up until the 1970s the Glebe Estate was in the possession of the Church. On the point the sea breezes attracted the wealthy who built villas. The Broadway end attracted slaughterhouses and boiling down works that used the creek draining to Blackwattle Swamp. Smaller working-class houses were built around these industries. Abbattoirs were built there from the 1860s. When Glebe was made a municipality in 1859 there were pro and anti- municipal clashes in the streets. From 1850 Glebe was dominated by wealthier interests. Reclaiming the swamp, Wentworth Park opened in 1882 as a cricket ground and lawn bowls club. Rugby union football was played there in the late 19th century. The dog racing started in 1932. In the early 20th century modest villas were broken up into boarding houses as they were elsewhere in the inner city areas. The wealthier moved into the suburbs which were opening up through the railways. Up until the 1950s, Sydney was the location for working-class employment – it was a port and industrial city. By the 1960s central Sydney was becoming a corporate city with service-based industries - capital intensive not labour-intensive. A shift in demographics occurred, with younger professionals and technical and administrative people servicing the corporate city wanting to live close by. Housing was coming under threat and the heritage conservation movement was starting. The Fish Markets moved in in the 1970s. An influx of students came to Glebe in the 1960s and 1970s.Murray, Dr Lisa. Central Sydney, 5 August 2009. Subdivision of lands In the 1820s Mr A. K. Mackenzie purchased at per , being portion 15 of the second subdivision. The study area is contained within it. The full extent of his holding is shown on an updated plan of the Glebe lands. During the following year he subdivided his purchase and submitted it for public action in July 1829. It was reported in The Australian of 22 July 1829. Frederick Unwin purchased most of this land, including the study area, for a little over . In January 1831 an indenture was made between Unwin and John Wood for the sale of the portion of the property for . It included the study area. In 1834 Woods' son, John William, paid his father and an annuity for life of for the property. Because of a complicated arrangement of deposit and repayments of principal and interest between the original purchaser and the Clergy and School Lands Corporation which had been passed on to each new owner Williams did not come into full title of the property until he paid the agent of the corporation (which had been dissolved in 1833) a balance of on his land. He was then granted title to a little over four acres. The title was issued on 31 March 1856. Woods retained ownership of this property until the 1870s. Council rate valuations of the 1860s record that he had a house, grounds, cottage and orchard very close to the study area closer to Glebe Point Road. It is likely that the study area was part of a garden or the orchard being this close to the main residence. Woods made a will in 1874 and appointed Trustees for his estate. He died in February 1875. Hereford House The trustees subdivided the property and it was actioned as the Glenwood Estate. On 27 November 1875 William Bull paid for lots 4 and 5 of the Glenwood Estate. This encompassed both the present-day 53 and 55 Hereford Street. William Bull was born in 1819 in Liverpool the son of a First Fleeter. In Glebe Bull is said to have worked as a local wheelwright. By the time he built and occupied Hereford House he was listed in city directories as a Justice of the Peace or solicitor. Bull appears to have used part of his land (the present No 53) almost immediately to build a new, two-storey residence he called Hereford House. He is listed in occupation by the mid-1870s in city directories and council rate assessments which simply describe his property as \\"house\\". By 1889 it was home to six people. The earliest survey plan of the property dates from 1888. It shows Hereford House fenced off from the vacant block of 55 Hereford Street. It is fenced from its other neighbour, a very large residence called \\"Lask\\" (now demolished). Between the two, from Hereford Street, was a passage running the full depth of Hereford House. The house is shown to a have a full-width verandah both front and back with a small brick extension at one end of the back verandah. Behind the house, some distance from it on the boundary fence with 55 Hereford Street, was a large brick-built stables. This had a brick WC at one end and galvanised iron shed at the other. No evidence of landscape is recorded on this plan. William Bull died in the new early years of the new century and the executors of this estate sold Hereford House to Alice Goldmsith and her husband William in 1909. William Goldsmith was a butcher. The improved capital value of their property was rated in 1919 as . The Goldsmiths sold Hereford House to Alexander Levi in 1924. Mr Levi leased the house to Ernest Arnold. A survey plan of the property in 1926 shows that the out-buildings on the boundary with Kerribree had been extended by this date to the back fence. The galvanised iron shed had been more than doubled size and abutting it and extending to the lane was another brick building. The water closets had been transferred to a block that occupied almost all of the back fence leaving a small gate between them and the brick shed on the boundary. Some extensions and changes are also shown to have been made to the back of Hereford House. Levi sold Hereford House in 1928 to Louise and Phillip Leonard. Sands directory listings show that Mr Arnold continued to lease the property at least until the early 1930s. In 1951 the Leonards sold Hereford House to the McCormacks. It has been claimed the McCormack, a Mayor of Glebe occupied this house since the 1920s and used the premises as a transport depot in his capacity as a growers agent. The stables at the rear of the property are claimed to have accommodated draught horses which were used to transport produce from the railway at Darling Harbour to the city markets. While the property may have been used in this way there is no primary evidence to show an association between it and the McCormacks before the 1950s. Similarly, the claim that there were two tennis courts at the rear of the property on which the champion Lew Hoad learnt to play may well be true but cannot find support in any primary evidence. The property was still in the ownership of Stephen Patrick McCormack and Sons Pty Ltd when it was sold to the NSW College of Nursing in 1981.Perumal M Wu Pty Ltd, March 2000.  Description  ;Exterior The building is single fronted. It has a simple hipped slate roof with terracotta ridge and hip capping, and boxed eaves. There is pair symmetrically arranged chimneys behind the main ridge, which are moulded and rendered. The building has a skillion and gabled corrugated iron roof above a single-storey section at the rear. The walls are generally ashlar rendered. There is a double storey verandah on the symmetrical street facade. It has a hipped corrugated iron roof. The verandah roof and first floor are supported on cast iron posts. The first-floor verandah has a cast iron balustrade and there is a cast iron valance on both levels. The windows are generally double-hung, with projecting sandstone sills and single pane sashes. There are two pairs of French windows on the first floor level of the street facade. ;Interior The building has a central hallway on both levels which provides access to a pair of rooms on each side. The hallway has a central archway and a timber stair with turned balusters. The original kitchen would originally have been located in rooms at the rear. There is a large proportion of surviving original fabric in the main part of the house, including plaster ceilings, roses and cornices, marble fireplaces and timber skirtings, picture rails, doors and architraves.  Heritage listing  As at 13 August 2002, Hereford House has historical significance for its association with William Bull, its first owner, a wheelwright and founder of the Glebe Rowing Club. The building also has an association with Stephen Patrick Mccormack and his family, the owners of the property from the 1950s until 1981. McCormack was a Mayor of Glebe. The building has historical significance because it demonstrates the process of residential development in Glebe in the mid-19th century. Hereford House has aesthetic significance as a representative example of a Victorian Filigree style house. The building has significance as part of the Victorian period streetscape of Hereford Street. The building has social significance because it is recognised by the community as a Victorian period house which is a major element of the Glebe streetscape. Hereford House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The site is one small part of the earliest European association with Glebe and its subsequent history of subdivision and sale into increasingly small allotments is typical of the history of Glebe. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Hereford House has particular associations with William Bull and Stephen McCormack, both prominent local figures. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Good example of their late Victorian-period architectural styles (Victorian Filigree and Italianate Filigree) The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. This site comprise some of the earlier residential developments in this area The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site is unlikely to contain a substantial and largely undisturbed archaeological resource. Some evidence may be found of the changes made to the landscape, wells or tanks and disturbed fragments of buildings already known to exist. The evidence which may be exposed by future work is likely to add to existing information in quite minor ways. It is unlikely to have potential for substantive interpretive or investigative values. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The residential use, style of house and the economic bracket they represent is characteristic for this part of Glebe during the later nineteenth century.

Career  Katia and Thomas Mann Born in Dresden as the son of a culturally interested factory director, Westphal attended the Realgymnasium in Blasewitz, graduating with the Abitur. He trained in acting with Paul Hoffmann at the Dresdner Staatsschauspielhaus, where he made his stage debut in 1940 in a minor role in Goethe's Götz von Berlichingen. He was then drafted for military service and later became a prisoner of war. In 1946 he moved to Bremen, where he was both a member of the and a speaker for Radio Bremen. From 1948, he headed the broadcaster's audio play division. In 1953, he took the same position with Südwestfunk in Baden-Baden where he remained until 1959. He was in contact with authors such as Alfred Andersch, Ingeborg Bachmann, Gottfried Benn, Max Frisch and Carl Zuckmayer. He commissioned new audio plays and collaborated with Max Ophüls, Will Quadflieg, Hans Paetsch, Oskar Werner, Walter Jens and Joachim Fest. As a recitator and audiobook narrator, Westphal recorded major works by German authors and also translations of writers such as Gustave Flaubert, Victor Hugo, Henry James and Thornton Wilder, with a focus on Russian literature by Chinghiz Aitmatov, Fjodor Dostojewski, Nikolai Gogol, Ivan Goncharov, Maxim Gorki, Nikolai Leskov, Vladimir Nabokov, Leo Tolstoi and Anton Checkov, among others.

Groups that survive a long time are likely to have “got off to a flying start”, and this statistical bias creates an illusion of a true slow-down of diversification rate through time.  Birth-Death modelling in evolutionary studies  The evolutionary processes of speciation and extinction can be modelled with a stochastic “birth-death model” (BDM), which is an important component in the study of macroevolution. A BDM assigns each species a certain probability of splitting (\\\\lambda) or going extinct (\\\\mu) per interval of time. This gives rise to an exponential distribution, with the number of species in a particular clade N at any time t given by N_{(t)}= N_{(t0)}e^{(\\\\lambda-\\\\mu)}, although this expression only gives the expected value when N and t are large (see below). In the special case of there being no extinction, this simplifies to the so-called \\"Yule process\\".  Lineage-through-time plots  A different type of plot of diversity through time, called a “lineage through time” (LTT) plot, retrospectively reconstructs the number of lineages that led to the living species of a group. This is equivalent to constructing a dated phylogeny and then counting how many branches are present at each time interval. As we know retrospectively that all such lineages survived until the present, it follows that no extinction is possible along them. It can be shown that the rate of production of new lineages through time is given by \\\\lambda-\\\\mu.  Survivorship bias in diversification Rather than considering the distribution of all possible stochastic outcomes for given values of t, \\\\lambda and \\\\mu it is also possible to consider what happens when certain conditions of survivorship are imposed on the possible outcomes.  Push of the past If a BDM is forward-modelled, i.e. if the fate of an original single species is modelled through time, then a wide range of possible outcomes can occur, as the process is stochastic. With significant extinction rates, any particular clade is likely to be short-lived. However, we know that relatively long-lived clades such as the plants or animals by definition did not go extinct. As a result, their patterns of diversification will be a sub- set of all the possible outcomes for diversifications with their particular values of \\\\lambda and \\\\mu \\\\- all patterns with early extinction will be excluded. Imposing the condition of survival on a clade implies that rates of early diversification will be higher than expected. It can be shown that for a long-lived clade, the expected initial early rate of diversification is approximately 2\\\\lambda, as opposed to the long-term rate of \\\\lambda-\\\\mu. However, the wide confidence intervals on this value mean that values of initial diversification of up to 3\\\\lambda fall within the 95% range. Long- lived clades should thus show a characteristic early burst of diversification that quickly declines to the long-term rate, an effect called the \\"push of the past\\".  Pull of the present For a normal-sized clade, the push of the past is only observed in the raw count of species through time (e.g. that reconstructed from the fossil record), but the rate of lineage increase is affected as the present is approached. This is because recently created sub- clades within a particular group have an expected lifetime, and as the present is approached, these sub-clades will not have had time to go extinct. Thus, the rate of creation of reconstructed lineages should increase in the near past from \\\\lambda-\\\\mu to \\\\lambda in the present - living species by definition have an observed zero extinction rate. This theoretical apparent increase in the rate of lineage production has been termed the \\"pull of the present\\". Log plots of species numbers for both raw species (blue lines) and lineages through time (red line) when diversification is conditioned on survival to the past. In A, the rapid early diversification rate in the blue line is the push of past, and the late increase along the red line is the pull of the present. Shading gives 95% confidence intervals. In B and C, the observed slowdown in rates of diversification through time and relative to diversity are plotted. From Budd and Mann (2018). In reality, the “pull of the recent” has proven difficult to demonstrate: rates of lineage production in reconstructed phylogenies often show a slow-down or even decrease as the present is approached. This conundrum has been much discussed, and two major solutions have been proposed: first, that diversification is diversity dependent, so that as the carrying capacity of the environment is reached the rate of lineage production slows; secondly, that our modern species concept does not properly capture the “lineages” of BDM, and that speciation as we recognize it is only the end point of a drawn-out process of splitting of subpopulations through time, each of which could be considered to be a lineage in itself.  Turnover and survivorship bias For a given diversification rate of \\\\lambda-\\\\mu, it is possible to consider high turnover (λ and μ high) and low turnover (λ and μ low) scenarios. As the push of the past and pull of the present depend on the stochastic absence of extinction, it follows that both these effects are greatest when m is high, i.e. in high turnover situations. For example, if λ is 0.6 and μ 0.55 (both measured in rates per species per million years), the initial rate of species production would be 1.2 (2λ); but if they were 0.15 and 0.1 respectively, the initial rate would only be 0.3, even though the overall diversification rate (\\\\lambda-\\\\mu) is the same in both cases, 0.05. it can be seen that the initial rate of diversification in the push of the past can be much greater than the background rate; in the first case here, 24 times higher. Such high rates have often been observed at the origin of major groups such as the animals and angiosperms. It is possible that such striking diversifications are thus simply an effect of survivorship bias, and that if overall rates could be measured at their time of origin (including those of groups that quickly went extinct) no unusual rates would be observed. Consideration of the null hypothesis of survivorship bias is thus important when assigning causes to apparent cases of early rapid diversification,  Crown group origins The effect of the push of the past appears to be the reason that crown groups tend to emerge early within the history of a group as a whole: groups that diversify readily tend to create early new lineages.  Mass extinctions and the push of the past The push of the past is an expected effect whenever a small group is diversifying and its future survival is known to have happened. It should thus also be seen in groups that were heavily affected by mass extinctions and went on to rediversify.

Eugenic feminism was a component of the women's suffrage movement which overlapped with eugenics. Originally coined by the eugenicist Caleb Saleeby, the term has since been applied to summarize views held by some prominent feminists of the United States. Some early suffragettes in Canada, particularly a group known as The Famous Five, also pushed for eugenic policies, chiefly in Alberta and British Columbia. Eugenic feminism began to be articulated in the late 1800s and faded in the 1930s, along with decreasing support for eugenics itself. Generally, feminists argued that if women were provided with more rights and equality, the deteriorating characteristics of a race could be avoided. Feminists desired gender equality, and pushed for eugenic law and science to compromise and meet their views in order to breed a superior race. History When Francis Galton originally formulated eugenics, he saw women functioning as a mere conduit to pass desirable traits from father to son. Later eugenicists saw women in a more active role, placing an increasing emphasis on women as “mothers of the race”. In particular new research in the science of heredity and the studies of procreation, child rearing and human reproduction led to changes in eugenic thought, which began to recognize the importance of women in those parts of the human life cycle. This change in emphasis led eventually to eugenicist Caleb Saleeby coining the term eugenic feminism in his book Woman and Womanhood: A Search for Principles (1911).. Saleeby wrote, > The mark of the following pages is that they assume the principle of what we > may call Eugenic Feminism, and that they endeavour to formulate its working- > out. It is my business to acquaint myself with the literature of both > eugenics and feminism, and I know that hitherto the eugenists have inclined > to oppose the claims of feminism [...] Devereux characterizes Saleeby's coining of eugenic feminism as \\"at least partly a deceptive rhetorical strategy\\" whose goal was to \\"draw middle-class women's rights activists back to home and duty\\". In the 1930s eugenic feminism began to decline as eugenic feminists began to fall out with mainstream eugenicists, and had largely failed to sway the public opinion. In Canada In Canada, all members of the suffragist group known as the \\"Famous Five\\" were known to support eugenics, including Emily Murphy and Nellie McClung, the latter notably supporting the 1928 Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta and the 1933 Sexual Sterilization Act of British Columbia. In the United Kingdom > British eugenicists such as Caleb Saleeby, Karl Pearson, and Havelock Ellis, > held that women were essentially reproductive agents.[...] Proponents of > mainstream eugenics and some early advocates of women’s rights found common > ground. Not all early feminists supported eugenic practices, but the notion > of social advancement as intricately tied to reproduction was central to > both eugenicists and early feminists.[...] Some suffragists advocated for > staunch immigration policies and eugenic practices such as mental hygiene > and the social segregation and sexual sterilization of the “feeble-minded.”  In the United States   Victoria Woodhull  Victoria Woodhull, 1860 Victoria Woodhull was a prominent advocate of eugenics. Woodhull also had a husband that was abusive, alcoholic, and disloyal, which she thought that might have contributed to the mental disability of her son, Byron. With her newly sparked interest in eugenics, Woodhull promoted her views by giving addresses and publishing various books. A significant address was made on September 1871 and was titled Children: Their Rights and Privileges in which she claimed that “a perfect humanity must come of perfect children.” Moreover, she mentioned the importance of having “the best seed” to be able to have children that can grow into functional adults, the nurturing of parents to children, and the wickedness of abortion. With the effort of promoting eugenics by Woodhull, a portion of feminists also started to advocate for eugenics as well. These women thought that there were too many children and supported families that had fewer. In an 1876 speech in New Jersey, Woodhull placed a great importance on eugenics, more than the importance of obtaining the rights for women to vote, mentioning that women's suffrage was unimportant compared to creating a more superior human race. Woodhull's version of eugenics, which held that adherence to then-prevalent sexual norms led to degenerate offspring, was sharply divergent from the mainstream eugenics of the 1890s. Her views shifted over time, never fully aligning with the eugenicist mainstream, particularly on birth control.  Charlotte Perkins Gilman  Charlotte Perkins Gilman, 3 July 1860 As a leading feminist author of her time, Charlotte Perkins Gilman published various feminist literary works, including poems, articles on eugenics for The Forerunner, and novels such as: Women and Economics, Herland, With Her in Ourland and His Religion and Hers. In Herland, Gilman champions eugenic feminism by imagining an all- female utopian society made up of women who somehow were able to reproduce asexually. They all descended from a single mother, therefore miscegenation was not a problem in her imagined society, neither, it seems, was inheriting undesirable genes, as those who were deemed unfit to reproduce were discouraged from doing so. Gilman’s arguments essentially promoted feminism by “representing eugenic ideology as the source” of help. She advocated equal sexual rights for men and women and advocated legalizing birth control for women.  Decline  In the 1940s, eugenic feminism began to decline. There were irreconcilable differences between feminism and eugenics that could not accommodate each other. Feminists abandoned their eugenic ideas and opinions when it became harder to gather support and more difficult to combine the two movements. Additionally, support for the eugenics movement as a whole began to wane as the public compared American sterilization practices to the sterilization laws of Nazi Germany which were deemed \\"totalitarian.\\" See also * History of eugenics * American Birth Control League * Planned Parenthood  References  Further reading  Devereux, Cecily. \\"Growing a Race: Nellie L.

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  History of the area The Leichhardt area was originally inhabited by the Wangal clan of Aborigines. After 1788, diseases such as smallpox and the loss of their hunting grounds caused huge reductions in their numbers and they moved further inland. Since European settlement the foreshores of Blackwattle Bay and Rozelle Bay have developed a unique maritime, industrial and residential character - a character which continues to evolve as areas which were originally residential estates, then industrial areas, are redeveloped for residential units and parklands. The first formal grant in the Glebe area was a grant to Rev. Richard Johnson, the colony's first chaplain, in 1789. The Glebe (land allocated for the maintenance of a church minister) comprised rolling shale hills covering sandstone, with several sandstone cliff faces. The ridges were drained by several creeks including Blackwattle Creek, Orphan School Creek and Johnston Creek. Extensive swampland surrounded the creeks. On the shale ridges, heavily timbered woodlands contained several varieties of eucalypts while the swamplands and tidal mudflats had mangroves, swamp oaks (Casuarina glauca) and blackwattles (Callicoma serratifolia) after which the bay is named. Blackwattle Swamp was first mentioned by surveyors in the 1790s and Blackwattle Swamp Bay in 1807. By 1840 it was called Blackwattle Bay. Boat parties collected wattles and reeds for the building of huts, and kangaroos and emus were hunted by the early settlers who called the area the Kangaroo Ground. Rozelle Bay is thought to have been named after a schooner which once moored in its waters. Johnson's land remained largely undeveloped until 1828, when the Church and School Corporation subdivided it into 28 lots, three of which they retained for church use.City Plan Heritage, 2005, quoting Max Solling & Peter Reynolds \\"Leichhardt: On the Margins of the City\\", 1997, 14 The Church sold 27 allotments in 1828 - north on the point and south around Broadway. The Church kept the middle section where the Glebe Estate is now. Up until the 1970s the Glebe Estate was in the possession of the Church. On the point the sea breezes attracted the wealthy who built villas. The Broadway end attracted slaughterhouses and boiling down works that used the creek draining to Blackwattle Swamp. Smaller working-class houses were built around these industries. Abbattoirs were built there from the 1860s. When Glebe was made a municipality in 1859 there were pro and anti-municipal clashes in the streets. From 1850 Glebe was dominated by wealthier interests. Reclaiming the swamp, Wentworth Park opened in 1882 as a cricket ground and lawn bowls club. Rugby union football was played there in the late 19th century. The dog racing started in 1932. In the early 20th century modest villas were broken up into boarding houses as they were elsewhere in the inner city areas. The wealthier moved into the suburbs which were opening up through the railways. Up until the 1950s Sydney was the location for working class employment - it was a port and industrial city. By the 1960s central Sydney was becoming a corporate city with service-based industries - capital intensive not labour-intensive. A shift in demographics occurred, with younger professionals and technical and administrative people servicing the corporate city wanting to live close by. Housing was coming under threat and the heritage conservation movement was starting. The Fish Markets moved in in the 1970s. An influx of students came to Glebe in the 1960s and 1970s.Murray, Dr Lisa. Central Sydney, 5 August 2009. University Hotel Originally the University Hotel, University Hall is home to students from the nearby University of Sydney. In the University Hall was renovated and expanded for use as apartments. Cottages  Heritage listing  As at 22 February 2013, the townscape is significant as a landmark building that serves as \\"the gateway to Glebe\\" located at the junction of Broadway, Parramatta Road, and Glebe Point Road. The 1837 earlier building was sited in expectation of a proposed new railway. The ballroom roof truss construction is a significant example of building technology and design. Terraces are rare surviving early residential buildings. The hotel was built between 1889 and 1890. The University Hall and Cottages was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Life  Born in Les Lilas, at the age of five Correas began studying the piano. In 1982, he met the great harpsichordist and musicologist Antoine Geoffroy-Dechaume with whom he began studying harpsichord and baroque style. After studying hypokhâgne and khâgne at the Lycée Malherbe in Caen, he obtained a degree in history and a degree in art history at the Sorbonne in 1986, and began singing in parallel with his studies. His meeting with William Christie in 1987 was decisive: he entered the Conservatoire de Paris in his Baroque music class and obtained the first prize, then continued his studies in Xavier Depraz' opera class. A member of the Arts Florissants from 1988 to 1993, he worked in 1991 with René Jacobs at the Studio-Versailles Opéra and was passionate about voice and operatic repertoire. On the advice and recommendation of Régine Crespin, he entered the École d' Art Lyrique of the Paris Opéra in 1991 and remained there until 1993. He diversified his singing activities by devoting himself to baroque music, opera, and French melodie which he practiced until 2008 (especially in the United States) with pianists Jean-Claude Pennetier, Jean-François Heisser, Marie-Josèphe Jude, Philippe Bianconi. He sings, among others, under the direction of William Christie, Jean-Claude Malgoire, Michel Corboz, Sigiswald Kuijken, and also Jesus Lopez Cobos, and Marek Janowski, Philippe Entremont, , Gabriel Garrido, Christophe Rousset, Christophe Coin. In 2001, he founded Les Paladins, with whom he explores the repertoires of the 17th and 18th centuries. His work focuses on the theatricality of the voice and the expressiveness of the instruments, as he is passionate about theatre and the stage. He gradually gave up his singing career to keep only recital and recordings before going into opera with Les Paladins. He is also a professor of baroque vocal style at the .

It is found in the eastern Atlantic around the coasts of West Africa. Description The Diassanga mullet has a rounded, rather robust body with a pointed head which is about a quarter of the length of the body. The eye is surrounded by a small rim of adipose tissue and its upper lip has a thickness equal to a third of the diameter of the eye while the lower lip is much thinner. It has a silvery blueish-grey back with paler flanks which are marked with seven longitudinal grey lines. The anal and dorsal fins are yellow, as is the caudal fin but this has a black margin. They grow to in standard length. Distribution The Diassanga mullet is an eastern Atlantic species which occurs in the coastal waters of Senegal, Gambia and Guinea-Bissau. Habitat and ecology The Diassanga mullet is a relatively large and uncommon species within its distribution where it occurs in shallow coastal waters and estuaries with sandy substrates. It breeds in estuaries. Its larval and juvenile stages are unknown. Taxonomy and naming The Diassanga mullet and the southern African striped mullet (Chelon tricuspidens) are closely related and these two taxa seem to have separated when the Benguela Current, as it exists today, was formed about 3-12 million years ago. The specific name refers to the Bandiala, one of the constituent rivers of the Sine-Saloum in Senegal. Conservation This species is subjected to some subsistence fisheries and the total grey mullet catch in west Africa in 2010 was 30,257 tons. The IUCN classify this species as Data Deficient and state that more research is needed into its current population size and trend as well as its habitats, ecology, life history and any threats to its population.

Biography   Youth  Aladár Donászi was born in Pécs in 1954. Contrary to most violent criminals, he was born into a family of intellectuals (his father worked as a public prosecutor and his mother was a teacher). He was a good student, and after graduation he was admitted to a law school. However, the young man did not start studying, and instead married at the age of 19. Seeing that obligatory military service was unavoidable, he applied to a military college. After graduating, he began serving as an artillery officer.  Beginning of criminal career  Donászi began preparing for a criminal career during his years in the People's Army. On March 17, 1980, he deserted, taking his rifle with him, later using it while robbing the National Savings Bank of Budapest on Irinyi Street. He stole 372,000 forints, but he was eventually captured.They captured the OTP account robber, Transdanubian Journal; March 19, 1980, p. 2 In September of the same year, he was sentenced to 12 years in jail.The OTP Robber, the Transdanubian Journal, was sentenced to twelve years; September 5, 1980, p. 2 While serving his sentence in the Star Prison, he met his future associate, László Bene, with whom he spent most of his time in prison. Donászi was a good-natured prisoner, writing regularly in the jail's newspaper and working as a scribe. Due to his disciplined nature, he was able to misled prison authorities into thinking that his punishment had served its purpose, and after nine years imprisonment, he was released in March 1989.  Crimes  After Donászi's release, he met up with Bene, and in 1989, they started their long series against tobacco depots. Mostly based in Transdanubia, they were involved in warehouse scams and high- value thefts. From 1989 to 1990, they made a total of 16.5 million forints from stolen cigarettes, sold through illicit trafficking in Budapest. Donászi, thinking he did not fit the image of a hard-faced criminal, decided to take actions for greater results. The pair bought weapons in Vienna and started practicing shooting in outskirts, also getting fake papers (Donászi obtained a fake internal passport - with his own photograph - from a forger to the name Márton Kálmán Gyula.) On June 12, 1991, Donászi carried out his first attack. In Győr, he tried to steal the salaries of the employees of a water company. At the door of the company, he expected the arrival of a car carrying money. When the car arrived, Donászi first seriously wounded the officer guarding the money, and then the porter manning the gate. The officer later died from his injuries in hospital, but the porter survived. Donászi's loot amounted to 870,000 forints. On May 11, 1992, Donászi and Bene attacked a taxi driver and his passenger carrying the Budapest Skála department store's revenue. When they observed a student boarding a taxi on Vak Bottyán Street, Donászi walked to the taxi and shot the money-carrying student without a word. In the meantime, Bene shot at the driver, then took the money and escaped. The student later died from his injuries, while the seriously injured taxi driver survived. The criminals did not get much from this robbery, however, as inadvenently they had stolen the bag which only contained other bags. On November 8, 1992, Donászi and Bene practiced shooting on the outskirts of Sárszentmihály. Two hunters approached, thinking they were poachers. When he saw them, Donászi shot and killed both of them. After these murders, investigators determined that the bullets were fired from the same weapon used in the attacks in Győr and on the taxi driver. During subsequent questioning of local residents, Donászi's accomplice, Bene, was reportedly seen in the area. On January 22, 1993, Donászi and Bene ambushed the Alfa store's cash-in- transit van in Újpest. The security guard, however, came earlier than expected. Donászi, who wanted to make the plan work at all costs, started shooting, but accidentally hit Bene's car. The shots had severely wounded Bene in his cheeks, which would only be removed by a surgeon later on. The relationship between the two robbers turned colder after the failure, and Donászi went abroad for a short time. On November 13, 1993, Donászi carried out his last successful attack when he attacked a post office on Soroksarí Street in Budapest. During the robbery, Bene only took part as a driver, but Donászi was still able to bring a fortune of 15 million forints. The police arrested a post office employee who was kept in prison for months. After the attack, the couple learned that a friend of their acquaintances knew of their murders and robberies. Donászi considered the woman to be a risk, so he prepared to kill her. However, this did not happen, as on May 4, 1994, both criminals were arrested.  Trial and death  When Donászi was arrested, he declared that he was to be considered a prisoner of war. He longed for a long punishment and thought that the news of his murders and cruel acts would give him enough prestige in prison to be able to reach the top hierarchy of prisoners, crowning his criminal career. In Donászi's public re-engineering of the robberies, he calmly and intelligently reported on his offenses. In court, on January 26, 1995, Aladár Donászi was found guilty of shooting with intent, stealing for profit and murder, and sentenced to life imprisonment. However, his \\"fairy tale\\" dream would not be realized. Following his arrival, the director of Sopronkőhida Prison placed Donászi in an isolated cell. During his imprisonment, Donászi took part in preparing a report on his life, giving correspondence and rarely interviews. He could have been released in early 2014, but on the evening of August 10, 2001, Donászi committed suicide in his cell by cutting his wrists with a razor.  In the media  Donászi and Bene were the favourite figures of tabloids because of their cruelty. Zoltán Taborori published an interview with on Nagydavak about their crimes. A film titled \\"The Gangster Movie, was released in 1998. Aladár Donászi was also noted as a deterrent example by the Hungarian movement for the restoration of death penalty during the 2010s.

It was designed by Edmund Thomas Blacket and built in 1860. It is also known as Bidura House Group. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 28 August 2017.  History  Indigenous history The traditional inhabitants of the Sydney city region are the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation. Despite the destructive impact of first contact, Gadigal culture and connections in Glebe endure. In addition to the Gadigal, Aboriginal people from elsewhere gradually moved into Glebe as it developed into an inner Sydney suburb.Graham Brooks and Associates Pty Ltd (2015). Conservation Management Plan. European land grants and subdivision The subject site is on land that was part of a 1790 grant of by Governor Phillip to the Church of England, officially named St Phillip's Glebe but known as \\"the Glebe\\". When the church reserve was subdivided into 27 allotments in 1828, Lots 3 and 4 of the subdivision were purchased by William Dumaresq, a captain in the Royal Staff Corps. Dumaresq first subdivided his land as the \\"Boissier Estate\\" in 1840 with Lots 1 and 2 purchased by businessman Stuart Alexander Donaldson in 1841. Victorian residence 1858-1920 The property was purchased by prominent colonial architect, Edmund Blacket, as family home while he was working on the University of Sydney in 1857. The landscape was still largely covered in dense bush at this time and Blacket is recorded to have \\"found it necessary to have four men to escort him home through the heavy timber after a day's work at his city office\\", along the track that became Ferry Road. Blackett built the two-storey house and single storey annex . Sketches of the building, dating from 1865, and likely drawn by his daughter Edith, label the building \\"Our House\\". Blacket sold the house following the death of his wife Sarah in 1870. The ballroom was constructed by subsequent owner, Robert Fitz Stubbs, in the 1870s. The extensive rear garden contained a number of outbuildings including a detached kitchen, scullery, servants' hall, store, servant's bedrooms, laundry and ironing room, workshop, tool house, two bedrooms, garden-house, carriage house, stables, and horse-boxes. In 1904, the northern corner of the property was subdivided and sold by subsequent owner, Frederick John Perks. Joint welfare and judicial role 1920-1925 In 1920 the site purchased by the NSW Government for use as accommodation for wards of the state. Children lived and were schooled on site. Originally called the Depot for State Children, but also known as Bidura Orphanage or Glebe Girls Home. The site originally had two functions: # as a receiving home: all wards of the state come to Bidura for processing after they had been removed from their families # as a remand facility: it also housed children awaiting trial in the Metropolitan Children's Court. At the time, under this dual function a common \\"child saving\\" objective saw children who had committed crimes, those who were neglected or abandoned, those who were from single parent families, or had Aboriginal parents, and those who were simply poor processed in the same way. The site was the central point of child welfare in NSW, being the first place most children saw after they were taken from their families and the transit point for their referral to other institutions or programs. As a result, this was the place many members of the Forgotten Australians and Stolen Generations entered \\"care\\". Development of the Metropolitan Girls Shelter 1925-1940s From 1925, the two functions began to be separated when the NSW Government reorganised its approach to child justice institutions. The government moved the Children's Court from Paddington to Surry Hills, and established two designated sites to house children awaiting trial-a nearby property, Royleston, was designated for use as the Metropolitan Boys shelter and a new building, the Metropolitan Girls' Shelter, was constructed fronting Avon Street at the rear of Bidura House. Both Bidura and the Girls Shelter operated on the subject site under the same administration and appear to have shared facilities for the first few decades, with the entire site known as the Metropolitan Girls' Shelter until the 1940s. The site as a whole was notoriously known as a place where cruelty and abuse were an everyday occurrence. This has caused significant ongoing distress and associated health and social problems for the former residents and their families, as specifically recognised in the Forgotten Australian's report of 2004. Separation of Bidura and Metropolitan Girls Shelter 1940-1977 By 1943 the Victorian house group was simply known as Bidura and appears to have been both administratively and physically separated from the Metropolitan Girls Shelter fronting Avon Street. The site was subject to protests by Women's Liberationists in the 1970s for the plight of female residents. Adaptation of all buildings and erection of additional outbuildings was undertaken in line with shifts in thinking, for example changing of open dormitories to single rooms, and adaptation of the ballroom for use as a school. Establishment of offices late 1970s-present Bidura closed as a residential facility in 1976/77 and the house was restored by the NSW Department of Public Works and used as office space for what is now known as the Department of Family and Community Services. Restoration works included demolition of the rear veranda and construction of a new one, removal of non-original internal partitioning and repartitioning of some areas for new purposes, reinstatement of some infilled openings and bricking up of others, replacement or removal of bathroom and kitchen fitouts, replacement of timber windows and doors, installation of new electrical, lighting and ventilation services. The site was sold into private ownership in 2014, with the Department of Justice planned to vacate in 2017. Institutional history This institutional history of Bidura has been recognised by Federal and State governments through a series of reports. The National Museum of Australia's Inside exhibition, (promised in the National Apology to the Forgotten Australians and Former Child Migrants delivered by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd on 16 November 2009 in Canberra) noted that three Senate reportsThe Bringing Them Home report of 1998, the Lost Innocents report of 2001, and the Forgotten Australians report of 2004 were undertaken following pressure from interest groups for the government to put on record the histories that had been hidden or unrecognised. The reports acknowledged that children had experienced systems of \\"care\\" and social attitudes that had utterly failed to protect them. It also noted that the places associated with these Australians, like the Bidura House Group, despite being adaptively reused for other purposes, or left derelict or demolished, continue to be repositories of these historic events and connections. In 2016 local heritage groups pushed to save Bidura, which led to the NSW Land & Environment Court rejecting a refusal of a DA by Sydney City Council for a proposed $43m redevelopment of the rear or the property, involving the five-storey 1983 Brutalist style court building as well as Bidura house and garden. Two apartment blocks were proposed, up to eight storeys high, behind (east of) the villa, which was proposed for retail and office use. In early 2017 the developer lodged an amended $29m DA proposing one seven-storey apartment building, which was due to be heard by the court by February 2018.O'Rourke, 2017, 22  Description  ;Landscape The street frontage is delineated by a timber picket fence. The landscaped area at the front of the Bidura House group is a notable feature of the site, where the early carriageway alignment, garden layout, lawns, and stone retaining wall form a fine urban setting for the early residence. There are several mature trees located near the street frontage and to the immediate rear of the residence. ;Exterior The front and rear facades of this three-storey Victorian Regency house feature the symmetry characteristic of the style, as evident in the overall rectangular form, the hipped roof and the arrangement of chimneys, windows, doors and verandas. On both sides, however, the addition of windows has produced a less symmetrical appearance. The external walls are of rendered, coursed and painted brick. The double-hung windows are timber, with external timber louvred shutters. The roof is clad in slate with decorative eaves brackets and patinated copper gutters, and features a central valley which appears to spill into a rainwater head on the north-western facade. On either side of the house stand two tall chimneys with corbelled cornices and metal chimney pots. ;Interior On the ground floor a wide partly glazed front door with sidelights and highlights opens into a central entrance hall with a marble and slate floor and a secondary hall with polished non-original timber flooring beyond. Off the main hall lie a square room on the north-west side and a larger rectangular room on the south-east. Off the second hall is another square room to the north-west and a rectangular room to the south- east. At the north-west end of the second hall is the main timber staircase, with simple timber balusters and a timber handrail. The rooms have plastered walls and chimney breasts and, excepting the front north-west room where the chimney has been bricked up, metal fireplaces with marble mantels and slate hearths. All have ornate cornices, picture rails, high skirting boards with moulded tops, wide architraves and four-panel doors. Although high ceilings with ornate ceiling roses are found in every room, the ceilings themselves are contemporary and plain, with inset downlights. The western corner room has a non-original polished timber floor; the other three rooms are carpeted. The current colour scheme uses shades in the pink-orange spectrum for detailing as well as green in the cornices, with a softer beige for the walls. The first floor features three square rooms and, in the southern corner, a larger rectangular room echoing that below. To the north-east of the central landing are a toilet and handwashing area fitted and tiled in relatively contemporary style, while the parallel area to the south-west is occupied by a storeroom. The four main rooms are fitted as on the ground floor; in this case it is the large southern corner room whose chimney breast has been bricked up rather than featuring a fireplace. The south-western wall of the stairwell shows patching from removal of the stairs once leading up to the 'Matron's WC'. The current colour scheme is generally more muted than that of the ground floor. The lower ground or basement level, once comprised mainly working areas, has square areas in three corners and a larger rectangular room in the eastern corner, echoing that on the ground floor. These have been divided to create a passage to the Annexe, two toilets and cleaner's store. The wall originally dividing the larger area into two rooms (scullery and perhaps pantry) has been largely removed to form one room. At the bottom of the stairwell is a possibly original tongue and groove timber door with long strap hinges, leading to the outside. Opposite the stairs across the central hallway is a narrow contemporary kitchen and between the southern and western corner rooms is a narrow storeroom. Walls are painted brick, except the larger eastern corner room which is plastered. Some original doorways are flat-arched. Cornices and other details are absent and the contemporary, plain ceilings are notably lower than in upper storeys. A variety of contemporary services have been fixed to walls and ceilings and in some places penetrate brick walls. One pane of a window on the north-west side has been removed to accommodate computer cabling. Floors are mostly vinyl or carpet; the WC and cleaner's store is ceramic-tiled. The current colour scheme is a relatively simply one based on cream and green. ;Annex exterior The annex is a one-storey rectangular structure at basement level with double hung windows and a hipped slate roof.

The external walls are coursed, rendered and painted brick featuring ornate cornices at ceiling and roof height and parapet walls castellated at the north-western and southwestern sides. At the front (south-western) facade is a Vestibule annex with double timber panelled entrance doors at the north-west and two double-hung windows to the south-west. The main building has two (original) pairs of double-hung windows to the north-west and four (non-original) double-hung windows and a small highly placed central window to the north-east.

Restoration of Bidura House and Ballroom.  Heritage listing  As at 10 March 2017, the Bidura House Group is of state heritage significance as a key point in a broader network of places associated with child welfare and juvenile justice in NSW. It functioned from 1920-1977 as the NSW receiving home, under various names. It is of state historical significance as during this period all wards of the state came to Bidura House before being fostered out or transferred to other institutions. It also functioned between 1920 and the 1940s as accommodation for children on remand awaiting trial in the Metropolitan Children's Court. It is therefore historically and socially significant for its impact on children and their families who were affected by child welfare and juvenile justice systems including the Forgotten Australians and Stolen Generations for a period of almost sixty years. Bidura House Group is also of state significance aesthetically as a good example of Victorian regency design, and via its strong association with prominent NSW architect Edmund Blacket. Bidura House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 28 August 2017 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Bidura House Group is of historical significance at a state level as a key point in a broader network of places associated with child welfare and juvenile justice in NSW. It functioned from 1920-1977 as child accommodation. During this period all wards of the state came to Bidura House before being fostered out or transferred to other institutions. It also functioned between 1920 and the 1940s as accommodation for children on remand awaiting trial in the Metropolitan Children's Court. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The building is associated with prominent colonial architect Edmund Thomas Blacket who purchased the site in 1857, built the regency-style residence, Bidura, c.1860 and lived there with his family until 1870. The site has been occupied by various government child welfare and juvenile justice institutions, including the Depot for State Children, Glebe Girls' Home, Glebe Orphanage, Metropolitan Shelter for Girls, and the Department of Family and Community Services over a period of 96 years. As the first place most children were housed after being removed from their families before their referral to other institutions, this was the place many members of the Forgotten Australians and Stolen Generations entered \\"care\\". As such, Bidura has strong associations with these groups. The site is also associated with mid-20th century feminist movement. In the 1970s, Bidura House, along with Parramatta Girls' Home and Hay Institution for Girls, were targeted by Bessie Guthrie and activists from the Women's Liberation movement for abuses against young women. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The precinct is socially significant for its impact on NSW children and their families who were affected by the juvenile justice system including the Forgotten Australians and Stolen Generations. Its importance is indicated by attention given to the site in publications such as the Forgotten Australians Report, the Find & Connect web resource on institutional \\"care\\" in Australia, the National Library of Australia's Forgotten Australians and former child migrants oral history project and the Sydney Barani website. It continues to be a focal point for campaigns recognising the history of abuse in child institutions such as the \\"Loud Fence\\" Campaign in 2016. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site is of potential technical significance at a state level as its fabric provides evidence of the conditions experienced in children's homes and remand facilities from the 1920s to the 1980s. The buildings together with descriptions of their former use, provide an insight into the processing, domestic routine and methods employed in the treatment of NSW minors in the state system. Many of the oral histories of former residents describe the routine at these institutions. Evidence of the various alterations and additions undertaken over time reflect changing philosophies and practises such as partitions which show the shift from open dormitories to single rooms at Bidura house. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site is rare within NSW as a State children's welfare facility which operated continuously from the 1920s to the late 1970s, showing, through its modifications, changing philosophies of child welfare over time. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Though modest in its detailing, the form, design and main elements of Bidura House make it a good example of upper-middle-class Victorian Regency residential architecture. The Ballroom is a simple example of the Victorian Italianate style.

Co-written and directed by Parkpoom Wongpoom, the film is based on the Japanese novel Colorful by Eto Mori. It stars Teeradon Supapunpinyo as a spirit who gets to inhabit the body of Min, a teenager who recently committed suicide, and bring him back to life. The film was released in theatres on 25 October 2018. Plot The protagonist wakes up in a hospital morgue. Confused, he attempts to escape, but is confronted by several people who reveal themselves to be \\"the Guardian\\", and tells him that he is a spirit who has been given a second chance at life in the body of Min, a teenager who recently committed suicide. The Guardian tells him that he has 100 days to discover the reason for Min's death, or die permanently. Reluctantly, the spirit assumes the role of Min, going home with his mother. He meets his brother Menn, who does little to conceal his dislike of Min, and his father, who had quit his job as a university lecturer to pursue a multi- level marketing career selling supplements. His mother, an engineer, soon returns to work in a distant province. At school, he discovers that Min has few friends, Li being his only close friend, and that he has a crush on Pi, his elder tutoring peer who is a top student. The spirit gradually adjusts to Min's life, and begins to feel comfortable, but as his relationship with Pi develops and he attempts to delve into Min's past, he discovers the many problems he had with his family and friends. His brother hates him for being the problem child, his father ruined the family's finances, and his mother is having an affair. Pi was allowing a teacher to molest her in exchange for academic opportunities. He realizes why Min would want to leave this life, and tells the Guardian that all of them contributed to Min's suicide, but the answer was rejected, wasting his only chance. Resigned to the final days of his life as Min, several events lead him to notice the love and support others have offered. Seeing things in a new light, he tries to make the best of his remaining days, addressing past conflicts and tying up loose ends. On his last day, he and Li watch rehearsals for the school's card stunt competition, for which Li had submitted one of Min's old designs (from before his suicide). As the card stunt is shown to be identical to a design the new Min recently drew, he realizes just as time runs out that he was Min in his previous life, and past memories come rushing back to him. He sees the Guardian one last time, and tells the Guardian that his death was his own fault, as he refused to see the positive things in life. The Guardian reveals to him that the test was a trick to make him realize, and that he can now enjoy his new life.

GDH spent almost eight years to secure the rights for a Thai film adaptation. It is the novel's third film adaptation following a 2000 live action film and a 2010 anime, both titled after the novel. The project was first helmed by GDH director and executive Yongyoot Thongkongtoon, but after a year of development, was handed over to Parkpoom Wongpoom in 2016. Parkpoom had previously co-directed the 2004 hit horror film Shutter and some other anthologies, but Homestay was his first solo feature. He spent nineteen months further developing the script. Teeradon was cast in the lead role, while Cherprang, who is also \\"captain\\" of the girl idol group BNK48, made her acting debut in the film. The actors spent three months in acting workshops and another three in actual production. The film involves several shots featuring extensive computer-generated visual effects, which Parkpoom expressed difficulty working with. The film was marketed to international buyers at the Filmart event in Hong Kong in March 2018. Originally described as a fantasy drama, later marketing material opted to promote the film as a thriller fantasy instead. The film was announced on 19 September, with a press event held on 2 October. Release and reception The film was released in Thailand on 25 October 2018. It earned 37.49 million baht (US$1.14 million) over its opening weekend, placing first at the box office for two weeks. By 18 November, it had earned 66.58 million baht ($2.02 million), a moderately respectable figure. The film was screened in several international markets, beginning with Hong Kong on 6 December 2018. The film was met with mixed reviews. While most reviewers commended Teeradon's acting, which capably carried the story, some found the screenplay to be lacking, noting that the climax lacked emotional heft and appeared too easily resolved. Time Out Bangkok review said, \\"The screenplay has its flaws ... but is thankfully overshadowed by James' surprisingly powerful performance,\\" while MThai's review noted that \\"the events that take place in the film don't lead as far as they should.\\" On the other hand, a reviewer for the Daily News praised the script for its \\"seriousness, drama, and reflection of various issues,\\" and Khao Sod reviewer found no fault with the film and called it \\"excellent\\". Internationally, James Marsh, writing for the South China Morning Post, gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars, summarizing that the film \\"rides on charm of its stars, [but] falls on its clumsy script.\\" Homestay received thirteen nominations at the 28th Suphannahong National Film Awards, and won in three categories: Best Supporting Actress (Suquan), Best Film Editing, and Best Visual Effects. At the 27th Bangkok Critics Assembly Awards, the film received ten nominations and won in two categories: Best Supporting Actress (Suquan) and Best Production Design.

It was designed by John Verge and built from 1833 to 1837. The property is owned by Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  History of the area The Leichhardt area was originally inhabited by the Wangal clan of Aborigines. After 1788 diseases such as smallpox and the loss of their hunting grounds caused huge reductions in their numbers and they moved further inland. Since European settlement the foreshores of Blackwattle Bay and Rozelle Bay have developed a unique maritime, industrial and residential character - a character which continues to evolve as areas which were originally residential estates, then industrial areas, are redeveloped for residential units and parklands. The first formal grant in the Glebe area was a grant to Richard Johnson, the colony's first chaplain, in 1789. The Glebe (land allocated for the maintenance of a church minister) comprised rolling shale hills covering sandstone, with several sandstone cliff faces. The ridges were drained by several creeks including Blackwattle Creek, Orphan School Creek and Johnston Creek. Extensive swampland surrounded the creeks. On the shale ridges, heavily timbered woodlands contained several varieties of eucalypts while the swamplands and tidal mudflats had mangroves, swamp oaks (Casuarina glauca) and blackwattles (Callicoma serratifolia) after which the bay is named. Blackwattle Swamp was first mentioned by surveyors in the 1790s and Blackwattle Swamp Bay in 1807. By 1840 it was called Blackwattle Bay. Boat parties collected wattles and reeds for the building of huts, and kangaroos and emus were hunted by the early settlers who called the area the Kangaroo Ground. Rozelle Bay is thought to have been named after a schooner which once moored in its waters. Johnson's land remained largely undeveloped until 1828, when the Church and School Corporation subdivided it into 28 lots, 3 of which they retained for church use.City Plan Heritage, 2005, quoting Max Solling & Peter Reynolds \\"Leichhardt: On the Margins of the City\\", 1997, 14 The Church of England sold 27 allotments in 1828 - north on the point and south around Broadway. The Church kept the middle section where the Glebe Estate is now. Up until the 1970s the Glebe Estate was in the possession of the Church. On the point the sea breezes attracted the wealthy who built villas. The Broadway end attracted slaughterhouses and boiling down works that used the creek draining to Blackwattle Swamp. Smaller working-class houses were built around these industries. Abbattoirs were built there from the 1860s. When Glebe was made a municipality in 1859 there were pro and anti-municipal clashes in the streets. From 1850 Glebe was dominated by wealthier interests. Reclaiming the swamp, Wentworth Park opened in 1882 as a cricket ground and lawn bowls club. Rugby union football was played there in the late 19th century. The dog racing started in 1932. In the early 20th century modest villas were broken up into boarding houses as they were elsewhere in the inner city areas. The wealthier moved into the suburbs which were opening up through the railways. Up until the 1950s Sydney was the location for working class employment - it was a port and industrial city. By the 1960s central Sydney was becoming a corporate city with service-based industries - capital intensive not labour-intensive. A shift in demographics occurred, with younger professionals and technical and administrative people servicing the corporate city wanting to live close by. Housing was coming under threat and the heritage conservation movement was starting. The Fish Markets moved in in the 1970s. An influx of students came to Glebe in the 1960s and 1970s.Murray, Dr Lisa. Central Sydney, 5 August 2009. Lyndhurst Lyndhurst is built on part of a grant in 1796 of to Johnson on Church of England property known as the Glebe. Trustees of the Clergy and School Lands Corporation subdivided the Glebe in 1828 and Lot 5 was sold to Charles Cowper. The land for Lyndhurst was purchased from Cowper in 1833 by Dr James Bowman for . In April NSW's foremost Greek Revival style architect John Verge selected the site and prepared designs for the residence. In May and June the plans were prepared.Historic Houses Trust, 1994. Lyndhurst house was built between 1834 and 1837 as a \\"suburban villa\\" with view to Blackwattle Bay by Verge for Bowman, the principal colonial surgeon and his wife Mary. Mary was a daughter of graziers John and Elizabeth Macarthur. The house overlooked Blackwattle Bay and no expense was spared on its building or fitting out. The surviving papers and accounts would make Lyndhurst the best documented domestic dwelling of the period. In the grounds were the large service yard and balancing wings and stables designed by Verge, elaborately laid out pleasure grounds, shrubbery and the kitchen garden.Historic Houses Trust 1984. Francis Newman was the gardener at Lyndhurst. He was later appointed Superintendent of the Royal Society of Tasmania's garden in Hobart, which later would be renamed the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens, a post he held form 1845 until his death in 1859.Sheridan, 2011. The Bowman's occupation of their new home did not last long. Dr Bowman had become involved with his Macarthur brothers-in-law over the Australian Agricultural Company and in 1842 was experiencing financial difficulty. The Macarthurs took possession of the property and leased it to the short-lived St James Theological College. James and William Macarthur also became indebted and the Bank of Australia took possession of it. In 1852 the bank sold the property to the Roman Catholic Church for the establishment of St Mary's College, the most important Roman Catholic School in Sydney.Historic Houses Trust, 1990. St James was Australia's first theological college and produced several distinguished native-born clerics. The success of its classical department gave Bishop Broughton, Australia's first Anglican bishop, hope that it would play a part in the emerging university movement. However, its churchmanship was considered too high and this involved a major crisis which led to its demise. St Mary's shared a similar fate. It taught secular pupils while the English Benedictine community which provided the teaching staff formed a regular order. It had a reputation for its elaborate classical curriculum and high scholarly standards. The school began to decline in the late 1860s when competition from the country catholic schools, the Irish dislike of English Benedictinism and criticism for its high fees weakened its popularity. The college closed in 1877. In 1878 and 1885 the estate was sold, subdivided and terraced houses went up. The service wings behind the house came off, the stables demolished and the grounds built upon. Morris Asher MP, a businessman, bought the house in 1878. For some time after this the building was run as a lying-in (maternity) hospital. In 1890 Asher had the verandahs and porch demolished, the main staircase removed and the interior divided into a series of small rooms and passages. Stairs were provided for each house. The houses were not successful and the interior was returned to that of one house, adding to the already confused state of the altered interior. During the period 1890-1905 one of the terraces became Lyndhurst Private School run by Miss Agnes Watt. Lyndhurst was purchased in 1925 by Aubrey Bartlett who owned it until its resumption for the freeway in 1972. By this time the building had long ceased to be a residence and had been given over to factory use. Buildings had been constructed against its walls and it served as a broom factory, soap factory, ice cream shop and joinery factory among others. It was nearly destroyed as part of a freeway construction in 1972 but was saved by a Builders Labourers Federation green ban. Public support prompted by the Save Lyndhurst Committee for the rescue of a Verge masterpiece and a change of government led to the abandonment of the proposal and the subsequent restoration of the house by Clive Lucas, Stapleton and partners between 1979 and 1988. The first brief came from the Heritage Council in 1979 to see if the wreck could be saved. The Heritage Council Restoration Steering Committee inspected Lyndhurst on 26 October 1981 and the consultant project architect, Clive Lucas was asked to prepare estimates on the cost of replacement of the stairs, porch base, chimney pieces, exterior terraces and provision of a modern kitchen and toilet facilities. It was decidced to approach the Department of Main Roads regarding possible acquisition of adjoining properties to ensure an adequate curtilage for Lyndhurst. Housing and exhibition at Lyndhurst of architectural records, particularly drawings, was considered as well as transfer of the John Verge- designed building to the Historic Houses Trust of NSW as its main office and a resource centre on historic interiors.Heritage Council of NSW, 1982. Finance was allocated for necessary structural repairs, a temporary roof and caretakers accommodation. This halted decay and allowed for proper assessment. Initial recommendations, including restoration of the hall, dining, drawing room and library, were achieved by 1981, allowing the public to appreciate the house. In 1983 the building was transferred to the Historic Houses Trust of NSW to complete the project to provide them with a headquarters. Attention was first paid to the interiors. The last phase of the restoration was the reconstruction of the garden. This work was finished in May 1988. The weekend of 29–30 October 1988 marked the official opening of Lyndhurst as headquarters of the Historic Houses Trust of NSW and the Conservation Resources Centre. Members of the public were invited to visit. In 1990 Clive Lucas Stapleton & Partners were awarded the Greenway award by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects for Excellence in building restoration. The property was sold before auction in 2005 to Tim Eustace and partner Salvatore Panui for $3.3m who asked Clive Lucas back to do more restoration work, adding a new kitchen and opening the property to the public occasionally. The property is back on the market in 2016 following Eustace and Panui's purchase of Iona, in Darlinghurst from film makers Baz Luhrmann and Catherine Martin.Macken, 2–3 April 2016.  Description  ;Site and setting: Lyndhurst is located approximately south west of the Sydney CBD with a road frontage. It is a level site with city views available from the second floor. Surrounding development consists of older style semi-detached and terrace cottages on small lots and in varing condition.Valuer Generals Office, n.d. The house is set on of level land.Sotheby's, 2016. ;Garden: Lyndhurst's garden is much reduced on the original Bowman estate, which had an extensive parkland, carriage drives across what is now Wentworth Park and Blackwattle Bay's hinterland and was designed to be seen as a villa garden from the city, with the house sited on a rise, with harbour and city views. What remains is a vegetated yard to the house's north and east, wrapping around it on three sides, the southern side being predominanly paved and driveway. Darghan Street cuts very close to the house's western facade. The garden today owes much to the occupancy of the former Historic Houses Trust of NSW (now Sydney Living Museums) and input of its professional staff such as garden historian James Broadbent. It retains a number of trees including two tall mature Canary Island date palms (Phoenix canariensis) (one east of the house's garden front, one to its south), angel's trumpets (Datura (now Brugmansia) cv.s)(to the verandah's south), giant bird- of-paradise flower (Strelitzia nicolae (syn.S.alba)) on the verandah's north- eastern corner, Californian desert fan palm (Washingtonia robusta), sago palms (Cycas revoluta) in tubs and more. Wisteria sinensis has been trained up verandah posts on the house's eastern garden front. A number of large terracotta urns are planted with species such as pygmy date palm (Phoenix roebelenii), topiarised box (Buxus microphylla). Shrubs in the garden include frangipani (Plumeria x rubra cv.s), hairy sage (Salvia leucantha), NZ flax (Phormium tenax cv.), taro (Alocasia / Colocasia sp.), Nile or African lily (Agapanthus x praecox), bird-of-paradise flower (Strelitzia reginae), Camellia sasanqua cv.s and more. ;House: It is a large two storey house raised on a semi-basement. It is five bays wide by three bays deep with three main fronts. It has a corrugated iron roof, hardwood floors and fine details. The first floor windows are all finished with architraves and the french doors which open onto a raised terrace all carry entablatures.Lucas. 1972. Central hallway connects a suite of generous entertaining rooms, all of which have French doors opening onto wide verandahs. Features include a grand sweeping staircase, 4m high ceilings, original floors and fireplaces, modernised kitchen and bathrooms and palatially-proportioned bedrooms. It incorporates elements of restrained Green revival detailing which includes symmetrical planning, elevations with breakfronts and inverted pilasters at corners, classical portico, verandas, vaulted plaster ceilings and Greek Revival stone exterior and timber interior architraves.  Condition  As at 27 August 2014, the physical condition was good.  Modifications and dates  Significant developments include: *1852 - extensive Lyndhurst Estate subdivided. St Mary's College established and an east west wing added to the eastern services wing. * - Verandahs, service wings, stables and college additions demolished after subdivision. Estate around house reduced to a few metres on three sides, ringed by suburban streets. *1890-1905 - House subdivided into three terraces, merged into one and then divided into three terraces again. *1925-1972 - Buildings constructed up against the house by tenants using it as a factory. *1979-1988 - Restoration and reconstruction  Heritage listing  As at 2 October 1997, Lyndhurst possesses aesthetic significance as a work of architect John Verge (1782-1861); as illustrative of the history of design of villas and country houses, their positioning, gardens and estate curtilages, in NSW both in the 1830s and at other times (including its garden which while no longer extant appears to have been the first private gardens designed with professional advice, namely that of Thomas Shepherd); Lyndhurst possesses representative social historical significance as one of a series of villas and rural residences commissioned by prominent NSW families in the prosperous and optimistic 1830s; and through its commissioning and initial occupancy by James Bowman (1784-1846), a member, through his marriage to Mary Macarthur, of the prominent Macarthur family; Lyndhurst possesses specific historical associations with Anglican and Roman Catholic education and churchmanship in NSW; Lyndhurst possesses specific local significance to the Sydney suburb of Glebe; The fabric of Lyndhurst reflects changing attributes to and policies and methodologies for the conservation of heritage buildings (excerpts from NSW HHT draft CMP, 1994) Lyndhurst is an important early Sydney mansion designed by a leading architect for an important pioneer family. It is also important for the role it played in education both as a theological college and as a school. It also has importance in the conservation history of Sydney. The garden of Lyndhurst is significant because: * it was a prominent example of colonial estate development; * it was one of the first private gardens in NSW to have professional design advice; * the extensive retention of native shurbs and trees marked a change of thought in attitudes to landscaping in the Australian environment; * of its associations with Dr James Bowman, Principal Colonial Surgeon, and MLC; Mary Macarthur Bowman; Thomas Shepherd, Nurseryman and early Australian landscape designer; architect John Verge; and with early Australian schools.Long, 1986 Lyndhurst was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Lyndhurst possesses specific historical association with Anglican and Roman Catholic education and churchmanship in NSW. It housed St James, Australia's first Anglican Theollogical College (1847–49). The closure of St Mary's College coincided with the death of John Bede Polding, the first Roman Archbishop of Sydney. The operation of this college reflected the first phase in the history of the Roman Catholic church in Sydney, in which the English Benedictines were pre-eminent. Subdivisions of the Lyndhurst Estate in 1852, 1878 and 1885 allowed suburban development of this area of Glebe. The 1880 subdivision of the house into three terrace houses, and subsequent uses, including dwellings, girls school, maternity hospital and industrial uses represent the demographic changes in Glebe from middle class to working class housing. Lyndhurst possesses specific social history significance through its commissioning, and initial occupancy by James Bowman, a member of the Macarthur family through his marriage to Mary Macarthur. The family connection provides links between Lyndhurst and other work by Verge for the Macarthurs - Camden Park; Elizabeth Farm; The Vineyard, Parramatta and Ravensworth, Hunter Valley. The conservation and restoration of Lyndhurst 1979-1988 coincides with a period of gentrification of the suburb of Glebe. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Lyndhurst, built 1834-37, incorporates elements of a repertoire or restrained Greek Revival detailing which Verge acquired working in London before emigrating to Australia. The quality of this detailing places Lyndhurst in the early period of Verge's work, lacking the latter refinements of Elizabeth Bay House. Lyndhurst is positioned at the western end of a ridge overlooking Blackwattle Bay (now Wentworth Park) and Johnstone's Bay, leading to references to it as a \\"marine villa\\". The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The 1979-1988 fabric of Lyndhurst reflects changing community attitudes to, and policies and methodologies for, the conservation of heritage buildings. The public support for the save Lyndhurst Committee probably reflected concern over the future quality of Glebe. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Lyndhurst is representative of a series of villas and rural residences commissioned by prominent NSW families in the prosperous, optimistic 1830s, their positioning, gardens and estate curtilages. It is also representative of the fate of many of these houses.

Headquarters reside in Bulgaria, and for the purpose of promotion of the sport internationally the organization offers a ruleset which regulates the design and management of competitions. Competitions consist of several stages, and the competitors have to move between different parts of the stage under a time limitation, quickly assume stable or unstable shooting positions, and use theoretical background to successfully make precise long range shots. The main idea behind T-Class is to create realistic long range shooting competitions which are open to civilian sport shooters, police and military forces. A large emphasis is placed on safe firearm handling.  Disciplines  Firing line at a T-Class competition in 2016. A Steyr SSG 04 or 08 rifle during a T-Class competition in 2016. Competitions are divided into six major disciplines: # Long Range/Tactical Sniper. Precision rifle systems (sniper rifles) are used for reproduced but realistic stages with distances from 10 to 1000 meters. # Extreme Long Range. Precision rifle shooting at distances from 1000 to 1600 meters. # Ultra Long Range. Precision rifle shooting at very long distances of 1600 meters or more. # Multigun. Each of the stages may combine multiple firearms, such as precision rifles, medium range semi-auto rifles and/or pistols. # Support and Backup firearms. Shooting with pistols and medium range semi-auto rifles. # Rimfire. Target rifle shooting with .22LR caliber rifles. Each competition is divided into three modules of stages, which test and evaluate the marksmanship qualities of the competitor – precision, speed, physical and mental resilience. Competitions can be held as either individual or teamwork challenges. Teamwork competitions involve two-person teams in which the results and rankings of both competitors are scored together as a team.  Scoring system  Points are awarded by measuring each target in every exercise in milliradians (mrad) which takes into account its size and distance. There are also no-shoot targets which if struck incur penalties. The mrad system allows the usage of virtually all kinds of shooting targets, like paper, steel or clay targets, golf balls, soda cans, etc. Scoring is made with points attributed to the angular measurements of the target according to pre- defined tables. Usually each stage has a fixed time, but for some stages of Module 2 and 3, Comstock (hit factor) scoring is applied instead by taking the score on the targets divided by the time used on that stage. Scoring of each module is calculated by adding results from all the module's stages. The competitor with highest summarized result is awarded with 100 percent. The scoring for the other competitors is then calculated as the proportional percentage in relation to the highest summarized score, with calculation up to two decimal places. The calculated sum in percentage from all the three modules finally assembles the match ranking and demonstrates the winner.

The case drew public attention, due in part to the refugee status of most of the perpetrators. Incident According to the police, on 13 October 2018, an 18-year-old woman was drugged in a discotheque in a remote industrial area along Hans-Bunte-Straße by a 22-year-old Syrian Kurd and then raped in front of the building by others, later identified as six more Syrians and one German; the accused were aged between 19 and 29.https://www.swp.de/suedwesten/gegen-verdaechtigen-von-freiburg-lag- haftbefehl-vor-28191426.html Police say that a man bought the woman—a student who was present with a female friend—a drink which apparently contained a tranquilizing substance, making her defenseless, and after going outside with her together, dragged the woman into nearby bushes and raped her, then left her there and returned to the club to call his friends. The woman filed a complaint with the police the next day.Gruppenvergewaltigung in Freiburg: Polizei sucht weitere Mittäter, Badische Zeitung, 27 October 2018Acht Männer nach Vergewaltigung von 18-Jähriger festgenommen, Tagesspiegel, 26 October 2018 Eight suspects were soon taken into custody.Polizei sucht nach Vergewaltigung mögliche weitere Täter, Die Welt, 27 October 2018 Investigation Several suspects were identified from DNA traces found on the victim; further evaluation of traces from the victim and the scene was carried out. The police sought more suspects, using a 13-person investigation team. One witness claimed that up to 15 men had raped the woman. Eight men were initially arrested for the crime, seven Syrians and one with German nationality. Three of the arrested had presented themselves on the Internet bearing firearms. The main suspect was already targeted by an undercover investigation for violent crime and drug trafficking, and he was a suspect in another rape case. Police had planned to arrest him on 24 October. DNA traces indicated there were two further unidentified suspects who were not among the arrested. A ninth suspect, an 18-year-old man from Syria, was detained on 29 November in a refugee center in Freiburg, after traces of his DNA were found on the victim's clothing. He was in the discotheque on the night of the crime; police took a saliva sample from him. The ninth suspect had come to Germany via the politically debated family reunification provision. Police continued to search for a tenth suspect whose DNA was also found on the victim.  Trial  The trial of eleven suspects began on 26 June 2019 at the '. On July 23, 2020, a German regional court convicted ten of the eleven suspects charged in the crime. The longest sentence was five and a half years, with the others given three to four years, and two who were convicted of not having assisted the victim were given suspended sentences. One suspect was found not guilty. Aftermath Martin Horn, the mayor of Freiburg, stated: \\"There is no tolerance for despicable acts\\". He promised to bring the perpetrators to justice swiftly. Thomas Strobl (CDU), the Interior Minister of Baden- Württemberg said: \\"If the allegations prove true, we have to deal with a vile act that leaves no one cold.\\" Officials called for calm, stating that \\"It is an act by individuals, which should not be generalized\\".„Eine abscheuliche Tat, die niemanden kaltlässt“, Die Welt, 27 October 2018 On Monday 29 October, a protest organized by the right-wing-populist party AfD/Junge Alternative was outnumbered by counter-protesters and the AfD event was re-routed as counter- protesters blocked their way. These tensions were similar to those in the aftermath of the murder of Maria Ladenburger by an Afghan migrant. The protest and counter-protest were attended by just below 2000 people. ZDF presenter Dunja Hayali demanded a \\"new and open debate\\" around the asylum and deportation laws because of the case. \\"That deportation procedures take so long that they cannot legally be implemented for 1,000 reasons and more is a situation that cannot continue\\", said Hayali, adding that her statement was not to be understood as xenophobic.Nach Gruppenvergewaltigung: Dunja Hayali fordert Asyldebatte, Hamburger Abendblatt, 28 October 2018 Boris Palmer (Alliance 90/The Greens), Tübingen's Lord Mayor, demanded that criminal refugees have their freedom of movement severely restricted, and proposed accommodating them in small asylum centres in remote areas without a connection to public transport.

The two-week delay in the incident in Freiburg becoming public along with the delayed reporting of another gang rape case in Munich where asylum seekers were suspects started a debate as to whether the late reporting was deliberate. Criminologist Christian Pfeiffer said that such delays are not politically motivated but reflect the fact that group crimes take longer to process where a network of suspects is involved, and even longer when police are forced to use interpreters. The victim suffers a post-traumatic stress disorder lasting at least until the verdict (as of 23th of July 2020).

History  The Parisii Quartet was created in 1981 by four students from the Conservatoire de Paris, all first prize in instrument and chamber music. In 1986, the quartet won the Grand Prix Radio Canada in the Banff International Quartet Competition, a competition reserved for the top ten string quartets in the world, previously selected. Then in 1987, the formation won the Evian and Munich competitions. Since then, the Parisii Quartet has performed regularly with the most prestigious chamber music societies in the world. Great soloists such as Jean-Claude Pennetier, Régis Pasquier, Pascal Moraguès, Isabelle Moretti, Anne Queffélec and Michel Portal, joined the formation in the quintet repertoire.  Repertoire  The repertoire of the Parisii Quartet is extensive, ranging from the 18th to the 21st century. Indeed, the four instrumentalists have often performed the premieres of contemporary pieces, both in France and abroad. Among these pieces are works by Pierre Boulez, Gilbert Amy, Régis Campo, Gérard Pesson, Guillaume Connesson, Laurent Lefrançois, Philippe Boivin, Garcia Roman, Tomás Marco, Richard Rodney Bennett, etc ... Their repertoire also includes works by Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms and Webern, not to mention the French music of the 20th century, with Franck, Fauré, Vierne, Debussy, Ravel and also Milhaud.  Discography  Among their recordings are the quintets with oboe by Boccherini, or the world premiere recording of the Quartet Book by Boulez (complete Boulez box set at Deutsche Grammophon). Their discography also includes many complete quartets such as those of Beethoven, Brahms, Webern and Milhaud. Their recordings of the quartets of Debussy and Ravel have been ranked ffff by Télérama and Choc by Le Monde de la musique, also distinguished by the prize for the new academy of music for the Franck and Webern CD. More recently, their recording of the string quartets and piano quintet of Reynaldo Hahn has been unanimously hailed by critics.Quatuor Parisii (Flâneries Musicale de Reims)  References   External links  * Official website  * Darius Milhaud: String Quartet No. 18, Op. 308 (Quatuor Parisii) (YouTube) Parisii Category:Musical groups established in 1981 ","title":"Parisii Quartet"},{"id":"58892413","text":"Kylan Hamdaoui (born 15 April 1994) is a French rugby union full-back and he currently plays for Stade Français in the French Top 14.

History MCC was first established in 2008 in Koh Rong Samloem, by British conservationist Paul Ferber. MCC was one of the driving force behind the creation of Koh Rong Samloem's first ever conservation areas, with one area designated by the local community and legislated by national Fisheries Administration and one area designated by MCC and legislated by the local authorities. These areas were the start of Koh Rong Samloem's very first Zoning plans and the precursor to the current Marine Fisheries Management Area (MFMA), Cambodia's equivalent of Marine protected area. In 2013, MCC was invited by the provincial government of Kep to begin work preparing for a second MFMA in Kep province. The organisation undertook marine surveys around Kep's 13 islands to monitor the coral reefs, seagrass beds and seahorse populations to assist the Provincial Authorities in the creation of the proposed MFMA. In March 2016, MCC submitted to local and national authorities a proposal of MFMA zoning plan for Kep Archipelago. In 2017, the proposal was approved and included in the Cambodian National Action Plan for Fisheries Conservation and the National Plan of Action for combating Illegal, Unreported, Unregulated fishing (IUU). In January 2018, the official 11,354-hectares map was accepted and signed by all provincial authorities, and on 12 April 2018, the New Marine Fisheries Management Area in Kep Province was finally approved and promulgated by the Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries under the National Fisheries, Department of Conservation and with the support from Kep's Provincial Administration. In April 2019, the Kep Archipelago was declared a Hope Spot by Sylvia Earle Alliance/Mission Blue, \\"in recognition of the impact that MCC’s conservation work has had in preserving the area’s unique seagrass meadows and sensitive marine species\\" Management of Kep Archipelago's MFMA Kep's Marine Fisheries Management Area (MFMA) is the second in the country, and was created through a partnership between Cambodia's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Kep province government, local fishing communities, and MCC. Encompassing the nine islands of the archipelago, the MFMA includes different zones with special regulations in order to protect the local ecosystem from Illegal, Unregulated, Unreported (IUU) fishing, which destroyed the majority of the local bivalve populations and seagrass meadows. Two no- take zones have been established, one around Koh Ach Seh and another around Koh Angkrong, where only scientific research activities are allowed, with other activities such as fishing, anchoring and tourism strictly forbidden. Others protection zones include a refuge area near Koh Po where fishing is prohibited during specific times of the year, and two recreational research areas available for recreational diving and snorkelling, and for collecting scientific information. In the rest of the MFMA, subsistence fishing is still allowed, but all trawling and other types of intensive fishing are banned. As part of the MFMA provincial technical Working Group and management committee, MCC's roles include demarcation and overfishing prevention, research and monitoring, restoration, community outreach and general support to the department of fisheries conservation on the application of MFMA 5-year management plan. In particular, MCC has been tasked with deploying 150 anti- trawling devices along the MFMA's boundaries. These anti-trawling devices are made by the organisation on land, and are then placed on the seabed, preventing any illegal and destructive fishing as they catch, snare and entangle trawling nets. Besides acting as an anti-trawling device, the concrete hexagons/squares also act as artificial reefs and attract bivalves, sponges, barnacles and algae, which then in turn will attract organisms such as oysters and mussels, all of which naturally filters the water and therefore counter the threat of toxic algal blooms. In June 2018, MCC's anti-trawling structures were awarded one of the first three National Geographic Society's Marine Protection Prize.  Other research programs  Since its creation on Koh Rong Samloem, MCC has developed several research projects focusing on water quality and fish abundance, seahorses, marine mammals, coral reefs and seagrass beds. Besides its scientific projects, MCC has also tried throughout the years to raise awareness of marine ecology among local populations, engaging with fishing communities and establishing partnerships with local schools. * Seahorse conservation Four different species of seahorses have been identified within Cambodian waters. MCC's Seahorse conservation project aims to map seahorse species abundance and distribution in the Kep archipelago. MCC has been the first permanent marine conservation organisation in Cambodia to study seahorses, in partnership with Project Seahorse and the Cambodian Fisheries Department. These efforts resulted in including the specie in CITES endangered species for Cambodia. * Cambodian Marine Mammal Conservation Project The Cambodian Marine Mammal Conservation Project was implemented in September 2017 in collaboration with the national Fisheries Administration. The project's primary aim is to collect data on abundance, distribution and residency to delineate critical habitats for Kep's endangered Irrawaddy dolphin. Collected data will be used to design and implement dolphin conservation legislation for Kep province. * Seagrass mapping and restoration The Kep coastal waters used to host one of the most extensive seagrass meadows but it has been massively damaged by bottom trawling, and is still continuously threatened. The Seagrass Protection project aims to gather baseline knowledge of Seagrass beds in Cambodia's coastal waters, focusing on the province of Kep. * Reef monitoring and restoration Every year, MCC monitors the coral reefs of 3 strategic islands of Kep Archipelago in order to monitor corals, invertebrate and fish population. Species additions and removals are recorded to estimate ecosystem recovery.  Partnerships  MCC has established different partnerships with both national and international organisations.

The mountain is located in the Oruro Department, Sajama Canton. It is situated in Sajama National Park and is a composite volcano consisting of a stratovolcano on top of several lava domes. It is not clear when it erupted last but it may have been during the Pleistocene or Holocene. The mountain is covered by an ice cap and Polylepis tarapacana trees occur up to height.  Geography and geomorphology  Nevado Sajama is located in the Sajama canton of the Oruro Department in Bolivia, about away from the border with Chile. Cholcani volcano lies southeast of Sajama, and another neighbouring volcano, Pomerape, resembles Sajama in its appearance. A road runs along the southeastern flank of the volcano, with additional roads completing a circle around Sajama. The town of Sajama lies on its western foot, with further villages at Caripe northeast and Lagunas southwest of the mountain; there are also a number of farms. In Bolivia, the Andes mountain chain splits up into two branches separated by a high plateau, the Altiplano. Nevado Sajama lies in the Western Andes of Bolivia and in the western side of the Altiplano; more specifically the mountain is located before the Western Cordillera. Nevado Sajama rises about from the surrounding terrain to a height of (earlier estimates of its height are ), making it the highest mountain of Bolivia. Below the mountain is characterized by parasitic vents and a cover of lava fragments and volcanic ash. Two secondary summits and occur west and east- northeast from Sajama respectively; the former is named Cerro Huisalla and the second is called Huayna Potosi. The mountain has a conical shape and is capped by a summit crater that owing to its ice fill appears to be linked to the flat summit plateau of Sajama but other records do not indicate the presence of a crater. The Patokho, Huaqui Jihuata and Phajokhoni valleys are located on the eastern flank; at lower elevations the whole volcano features glacially deepened valleys. The terrain is characterized by a continuous ice cover in the central sector of the mountain, exposures of bedrock, deposits and rock glaciers in some sites, alluvial fans and scree in the periphery of Sajama and moraines forming a girdle around the upper sector of Sajama. The ground moraines are the most prominent moraines on Sajama, and have varying colours depending on the source of their component rocks. Vegetation and small lakes occur in their proximity, while other parts are unvegetated. They mostly occur within glacial valleys, but some appear to have formed underneath small plateau ice caps on flatter terrain. A number of wetlands called bofedales occur on the mountain. Starting in the lake Laguna Huana Kkota on the northwestern foot of Sajama, the Tomarapi River flows first northeastward, then east, south and southeast around the northern and eastern flanks of the volcano; the Sicuyani River which originates on Sajama joins it there. The southern flanks give rise to the Huaythana River which flows directly south and then makes a sharp turn to the east. On the western side of the volcano originates the Sajama River which flows due south and increasingly turns southeast before joining the Lauca River. The other rivers draining Sajama and its ice cap also eventually join the Lauca River and end in the Salar de Coipasa.  Geology  Nevado Sajama is part of the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes, where volcanism is triggered by the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South America Plate. Changes in the subduction regime took place during the Oligocene and directed an increase of volcanic activity in the region. Volcanoes in the region have ages ranging from Pleistocene to Miocene and grew on top of earlier ignimbrites; the whole volcanic activity was controlled by faults. The mountain is a stratovolcano located atop several lava domes. The stratovolcano consists of lava flows and pyroclastic material which radiate away from the centre of the volcano. Some parasitic vents occur southeast of Sajama and their location appears to be controlled by radial dikes; the whole complex is a compound volcano. Two later volcanic units are known as the Colquen Wilqui lavas and the Jacha Khala tuff. The Sajama volcano rises within a caldera that has been buried by later volcanic activity so that it is only recognizable on its eastern-northeastern side. A circular structure around Sajama may be the origin of the 2.7 million years old Lauca-Perez Ignimbrite. Hot springs on the Junthuma River Argon-argon dating has yielded ages of 679,000 years ago from Sajama and of 80,900 to 25,000 years ago for the Kkota Kkotani lavas, which are unrelated to the main Sajama volcano. The date of the last eruption is not known, it may have occurred in the Pleistocene or Holocene. Hot springs occur on the Junthuma River and reflect the presence of geothermal heat with temperatures of about on the western foot of Sajama, and volcanic rocks of Sajama bear traces of fumarolic activity. Three major geologic lineaments occur in the region, the north-northwesterly trending Sajama lineament, a west-southwesterly one aligned with high topographical features and a west-northwesterly one. The west-southwesterly one played an important role in the development of Sajama volcano.  Composition  The volcano has erupted rocks ranging from andesite to rhyodacite, with the main stratovolcano formed by andesites that contain hornblende and pyroxene and phenocrysts of augite, biotite, iron oxide, olivine, orthopyroxene, pargasite, plagioclase, quartz and titanium oxide. Deposits of copper, gold, lead, silver and sulfur were reported as well. The volcanic rocks erupted by Sajama define a potassium-rich calc-alkaline suite and formed through various processes, including assimilation of country rock, fractional crystallization and magma mixing (particularly in the Sayara lavas).  Climate  At Cosapa on the foot of Sajama, annual mean temperatures are about while the town of Sajama sees annual temperatures of ; precipitation there is about . The daily temperature range approaches there. Sajama is located between two climate regimes, a westerly one characterized by a dry climate and the Southeast Pacific High and an easterly one with a moister atmosphere. During the southern hemisphere summer, easterly winds carry moist air towards Sajama where solar insolation then triggers showers and thunderstorms; the moisture ultimately originates in the Atlantic Ocean. During winter, dry westerly winds prevail although cold air outbreaks from the westerlies belt sometimes trigger intense snowfall which is often underestimated by precipitation data. Overall, on the Altiplano precipitation diminishes from the northeast to the southwest. Summer precipitation is typically reduced during El Nino years, but on Nevado Sajama there is little correlation.  Vegetation  While the vegetation of the surroundings of Sajama is considered to be a dry grassland known as puna, on the mountain itself there is some vertical gradation. Below shrubs such as asteraceae, cactaceae, fabaceae and solanaceae dominate the vegetation. Between the last three families become less important. Here especially during the wet season poaceae grasses become more important; finally above frost-tolerant herbs such as Azorella and asteraceae, caryophyllaceae, malvaceae and poaceae make up most of the vegetation. In depressions or places where water occurs, peat bogs called bofedales develop. Taxa that occur here include apiaceae, cyperaceae, Azolla, Distichia and Plantago. Up to elevation Polylepis tarapacana forms woodlands that have both a sharp upper and a sharp lower limit on the mountain. The trees are usually no higher than and are separated by large distances from each other and appear to localize to spots where water is available. The current woods are remnants; whether the decrease is caused by human impact or climate change is not clear. Protecting these woodlands was the impetus for the 1939 creation of the Sajama National Park. File:Polylepis Tarapacana 1.jpg File:Polylepis Tarapacana 2.jpg File:National parks of bolivia.PNG  Glaciers  Summit of Sajama Above , Sajama is extensively glaciated. It is among the southernmost mountains in the region with significant glaciers; farther south the atmosphere is too dry to permit the development of glaciers. Two ice cores were taken in 1997 from the summit area after a preceding religious ceremony, as the local Aymara people feared that the mountain deities would be angered by the drilling otherwise. Rock glaciers also occur above the zero degree isotherm above , such as on lateral peaks. Sajama and neighbouring mountains featured much larger glaciers in the past. The history of glaciation on Sajama in general is poorly known, but it appears that the outermost glacial features originated during the late last glacial maximum and the intermediary features during the Middle Holocene which is usually considered to be a warm and dry period in the region.  Human interactions  A number of oral traditions record beliefs involving Sajama. In one myth, Sajama is the head of the Mururata mountain after the latter was decapitated by Illimani mountain, both in the Eastern Cordillera. Other mythologies assert that the Nevados de Payachata (Pomerape and Parinacota) are the children of Sajama and Anallaxchi. In another local belief, Tacora and Sajama were two mountains in competition for two women (the Nevados de Payachata). Depending on the specific myth either the two women drove Tacora off and removed the top of the mountain, or Sajama did and injured Tacora; Tacora subsequently fled, shedding blood and a piece of its heart. During the second undisputed ascent on the mountain in 1946, one mountaineer disappeared and his body was never found. In August 2001, two teams of Sajama villagers and Bolivian mountain guides played a football match on top of Mount Sajama in an effort to show that altitude itself is not a limitation to physical strain.

It contains one species, Parsigecko ziaiei, known as Ziaie's Pars-gecko. It is found in southern Iran. Description The adult, gravid female holotype had a snout-to-vent length of with a slender body across, and an elongated snouth. The tail was broken but regenerated, longer than the body, with smooth dorsal caudal scales and two strongly keeled scales on the sides of each annulus. The precloacal area was covered with enlarged, elongated scales arranged in a single arch-shaped row, presumably carrying precloacal pores in males. The iris of P. ziaiei is yellow and grey with the pupillary slit outlined in yellow. The top of the head is cream with many small, dark brown spots forming blotches. The sides of the head have a chocolate-brown stripe from below the eye stretching to the side, connecting at the back of the head. The body is flecked with brown, the top yellowish-cream in color with 7–8 irregular brown crossbars and the sides light pinkish tan without patterning. The limbs are also pinkish tan with irregular brown flecking and cream speckling. The tail is yellowish with 6 distinct, brown, semicircle bands with the spaces between broader than the banding. Regenerated tail parts are brown with cream blotches. The ventral surface of the gecko is light pink to white. The genus Parsigecko is distinguished from other genera in Gekkonidae by a combination of the following: dorsal scales that are smooth, granular, subequal in size, not tuberculate and not imbricated, and two strongly keeled scales on the sides of each annulus of the tail. It is distinguished from other bent-toed geckos by its lack of dorsal tubercles, and from Microgecko species by its enlarged lateral caudal scales and single row of enlarged subcaudal scales. Taxonomy The genus and species were first described in 2016 based on two gravid females collected in 2015. The type locality of Parsigecko ziaiei is from the Koh-e Homag Protected Area north of Zakin, Hormozgan Province in Iran, at an altitude of . The genus name derives from the word \\"Pars\\" which is an old name for Iran and seat of the Persian Empire which was centered in south-central Iran. The species was named in honor of Hooshang Ziaie, a lecturer and ecologist at Islamic Azad University, North Tehran branch and former head of three provincial offices of the Department of Environment (Iran), \\"in recognition of his remarkable and outstanding efforts toward wildlife conservation in Iran\\". Distribution and habitat Parsigecko ziaiei is only known from the type locality, north of Zahin, Iran. It is a ground- dwelling gecko. The holotype and paratype were collected on steep hillsides in Zagros Mountains forest steppe in the Nubo-Sindian desert and semi-desert habitats. Associated plant species were Prunus scoparia (mountain almond shrubs), Pistacia atlantica (wild pistachio trees), Dodonaea viscosa (clammy hop seed bush), and Astragalus fasciculifolius (a milk vetch). Biology Each gravid female contained a single large egg, in diameter. Oviposition was estimated as occurring in late spring. P. ziaiei co-occurs with several other gecko species: Eublepharis angramainyu, Cyrtopodion kirmanense, Hemidactylus persicus, and Microgecko persicus.

The society chose for a scientifically justified presentation, and introduced multimedia techniques that year. The presentation consists of six wall displays, with 1) a chronology of the life of Gustav Mahler, 2) Attersee and Mahler's years there (1893-1896), 3) nature, people and Des Knaben Wunderhorn, 4) the construction of the hut, and 5-6) Mahler's second and third symphony.  History  In 1893, Mahler was kapellmeister in the city theatre of Hamburg. In that year he came to Steinbach for his first time, together with his sister Justine and a friend of the family, Natalie Bauer-Lechner. They booked five rooms in Gasthaus zum Höllengebirge to pass their vacation here. The natural environment inspired Mahler to compose two symphonies and a dozen songs. To be able to work in peace, he had this composing hut built in 1894 by Johann Lösch. There were three windows, and Mahler had a chair, table, stove and a piano at his possession. After he left, the hut remained constantly used for other activities. It has been as washing house, sanitary facility and slaughterhouse. In 1985 neglect and destruction were prevented, when it was renovated to house a permanent exhibition.

History Kings Square in 1962 Old Gloucester Bus Station bays in October 2012 Until 1933, the main type of public transport in Gloucester was the tram.The Golden Age of Tramways. Published by Taylor and Francis. In 1935, after the closure of the tramlines. Gloucester City Council partnered with the Bristol Omnibus Company leasing out its bus services. At this point in time there was no bus station in the city. However, the old tram depot on London Road was enlarged and used as a bus depot and is today used by Stagecoach West. The original bus station, which had 11 bays, opened in 1962 on the former cattle market site which is now part of Kings Square. This greatly increased the popularity of the shopping area around Northgate Street and Eastgate Street. Also at this time, a new inner ring road through the city was built, with the first part being Bruton Way which runs east of the bus station. In 2012, Gloucester City Council agreed to a deal with Stanhope plc to revamp the Kings Quarter area. This project was planned to cost £60 million with GFirst LEP providing a budget of £3 million to build a new transport hub to replace the old bus station. At this time, an eight week archaeological project took place to investigate the area around the bus station before any major development work was undertaken. A Roman flood bank was found under the station from this project. In May and June 2016, the old bus station was demolished in preparation for the new one which now had a budget of £7.5 million with £6.4 million of that coming from the government through GFirst LEP. Part of Grosvenor House was also demolished and several businesses including the Furniture Recycling Project had to leave the site. The original plans for the new transport hub included having a glass front to the northwest side. However, in July 2017 the city council submitted a planning application for a smaller building than originally designed with the northwest side being external render instead of glass. Additionally, the plans to demolish Bentinck House were put on hold. The proposed reason for these changes was due to a sewer being in an unexpected place and to provide greater flexibility for future development. Along with the building plans changes to the road layout around Station Road and Bruton Way were made to make the new transport hub more accessible. Construction of the new transport hub was started in August 2017 and carried out by Kier Construction, and it opened to the public on 27 October 2018. It has 12 bus bays, a manned ticket office, electronic timetable displays, a cafe and toilets. It also has solar panels to power the internal lighting and features a stained glass window designed by Thomas Denny costing £100,000. As of November 2019, the stained glass window has not been installed and Thomas Denny is no longer involved with the project.

Battle of Britain. Quercus Publishing Plc. London, 2009 p.172.North P. Eagles High. The Battle of Britain 50th Anniversary. Wordright Books, London, 1990 p.78 Captain Hill's technical skills were important in arming aircraft in both World Wars. In World War I he trialled methods of mounting machine guns in aircraft, evaluated heavy aircraft guns including the 37mm Coventry Ordnance Works (COW) gun, tested ammunition to be used against Zeppelins including the Brock bullet and designed and developed aircraft gun sights. In the inter-war period he worked at the Air Ministry where he continued to work on aircraft gun sights as well as showing how they could best be armed with the weapons then available. He made key contributions to the development of the GM2 reflector gunsight that helped the allies gain air superiority over Germany.  Early life  Hill was born on 24 February 1889 into a working class family in London (his father was a warehouseman). He excelled at school in science disciplines. Between 1907–9 he studied for and gained a BSc in chemistry at University College, University of London, and completed a course in teaching in 1910, becoming a certified teacher after which he worked at schools in North London. He married Bertha Winifred Underwood (1890–1950) in 1916.  World War I – Isle of Grain  F.W. Hill testing a collapsible gun platform fitted to a Short Type 184 seaplane in 1917 In 1915 he joined the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve, when his expertise in chemistry, physics, mathematics and engineering were noted. He received his commission in August 1915 and was appointed as Assistant Experimental Officer at the Isle of Grain seaplane base where he invented two sights for aerial guns. The Experimental Armament Department (\\"EAD\\") was formally established at Port Victoria Marine Experimental Aircraft Depot on the Isle of Grain in August 1915 under Flight Lieutenant P.L. Holmes and Sub-Lieutenant F.W. Hill RNVR.Public Record office AIR 20/488. Early in 1916 the Department was considerably enlarged and place under the command of Lieutenant Commander E.D.M. Robertson. By February 1917 the EAD had a complement of 111 naval ratings and petty officers. That month Robertson was appointed to the Air Board and the EAD was placed under the command of Lieutenant Commander R.A. Chalmers with Lieutenant J.K. Wells in charge of Section I (trials of Ranken Dart, bombs and bomb gear) and Lieutenant F.W. Hill, Chief Gunnery Officer, in charge of Section II (gunnery and ammunition). In concentrating on aircraft machine guns, Section II undertook trials of machine gun mountings, development of synchronous guns, and trials of heavy guns, including the quick firing gunPRO AIR 1/1201/204/5/2612 and the COW 37 mm gun.R. Wallace Clarke 1994 British Aircraft Armament Volume 2: RAF Guns and Gunsights from 1914 To The Present Day. (\\"Wallace Clarke\\") Page 42. In addition, there were trials of the Brock bullet that was used against ZeppelinsPRO AIR 20/495 (this ammunition was also trialled elsewhere, including at Kingsnorth in 1916.PRO AIR 1/658/17/122/587) It was during this period that Hill's interest in the design of gunsights began. A sight described as the ‘Hill’ sight was used in accuracy trials of the COW gun fired from an Airco DH.10 aeroplane. In spite of bad weather conditions, the results were very promising.  The Inter-War Years  The RAF was formed on 1 April 1918 and in May 1918 he was promoted to Captain and mentioned in dispatches for valuable services. In 1919 he was transferred to the newly formed Air Ministry. Experimental work at Grain continued until 1920, including on ammunition to ignite hydrogen In 1922 following the \\"Geddes Axe\\" which cut the defence budget by 42% and civil service numbers by 38% he twice received several letters advising him he would be made redundant followed by a later letter extending his service. During this period of uncertainty he made plans to return to teaching. However, his position was eventually made permanent (at a lower salary) and he joined the staff of the Armament Research and Development Section of the Air Ministry. He worked in a small section of three headed by Major H.S.V. Thompson and with Captain E.S.R Adams as a colleague. The section concentrated on gunnery. Thompson and Adams were acknowledged gun experts. Thompson played a major part in the selection of the Browning .303 machine gunWallace Clarke Page 57 and Hispano-Suiza HS.404 cannon for the RAF and AdamsWallace Clarke Page 65 oversaw the modifications needed to turn the original hand built prototypes of the Hispano cannon into weapons that could be mass-produced and installed in aircraft.  Gun sights  Hill's main contribution was in working with gunsights and armament trials in which he could bring to bear his mathematical abilities. In accordance with civil service practice at the time discoveries made by civil servants could be patented by them. He was awarded several secret patentsUK patent numbers 404362, 336030, 404719, 452915, 396108 and 1923 patents 20308 and 31614 and 1935 patent 15885 relating to reflector gunsight improvements, including the ability to adjust for range. He also patented the use of monochromatic light in gun sights (the 1920s equivalent of the modern red dot sight) and was awarded patents for improvements to machine gun muzzle locks and machine gun synchronisation gear. The reflector gun sight patents were later assigned to Barr and Stroud and used in the guns sights they supplied to the RAF during World War II including the GM2 reflector fixed sights used in fighters from 1938 and the Mk III reflector free sights used in bombers and adopted by the US Navy as the Mark 9.  Fighters with eight guns  The graph prepared by Hill in his own handwriting.PRO AIR 2/2741 Note the addition in pencil at 280 yards. For more see article on Gun harmonisation In 1931 Air Vice-Marshal Hugh Dowding asked for air firing trials to be carried out to determine the accuracies that could be obtained at the faster aircraft speeds now being achieved.PRO AIR 2/625 Hand written minute (He also asked for range adjustable gun sights which Hill helped to incorporate into Barr and Stroud’s GM2.) A long series of air firing trials were carried out between 1931 and 1933 which produced large amounts of data that had to be analysed and summarised by Hill. Often working through the data late at night at home, and helped by a mechanical calculator which he had borrowed from his place of work, Hill would draft in his thirteen year old daughter, Hazel, to assist with the calculations which would be remembered. The results produced were of sufficient quality to enable him to start making predictions about what might happen in actual combat under varying conditions of range and accuracy of sighting. In September 1933 Claude Hilton Keith took over as Assistant Director of Armament Research and Development at the Air Ministry. The conclusion that started to become apparent from Hill’s analysis – and that was almost unbelievable at the time – was that future fighters would need to carry no less than eight machine guns each capable of firing at least 1,000 shots a minute. In order to convince a wider audience within the Air Ministry Keith arranged with Air Commodore Tedder (then Director of Training) to hold a conference on 19 July 1934 in Tedder’s office at which Hill’s results summarised in the form of graphs were discussed. These results were generally accepted and a properly constituted Air Fighting Committee (“AFC”) was set up holding monthly meetings from 1 November 1934 with a place for Assistant Director of Armament Research and Development and for Hill as the most junior member.PRO AIR 5/1126 The requirement for fighters to have eight guns was included in the next issued Air Ministry specification for a fighter (F.5/34)Colin Sinnott. The RAF and Aircraft Design 1923–1939 – Air Staff Operational Requirements Routledge 2013 . Page 115 – a replacement for the Hawker Fury – the RAF's then current biplane fighter. Hill served on the AFC until the outbreak of war. The future tactics of the RAF were worked out by this Committee which is credited with instigating the multi-gun fighter specification leading to the Hurricane and Spitfire, the adoption of the reflector gunsight and the mechanically driven gun turret, among other pre-war developments.Weyl AR. \\"Fighter armament Part II\\". Flight, 21 September 1950 As war loomed the Committee became increasingly important.  Other work 1930–1939  Hill carried out various tests and trials for the AFC including on armoured glass requested by Dowding which was later fitted to fighter windscreens.Vincent Orange, Grubstreet Publishing London, 2011 Dowding of Fighter Command. Victor of the Battle of Britain He also investigated unusual armaments. Keith records that he sent Hill to France to investigate a mystery weapon that was claimed to bring down power lines. Hill filed a negative report. But his main concern in this period was the installation of reflector gun sights in the fighters and bombers that were now being built. Many problems had to be overcome such as condensation, sunlight reflection, composition of lenses and of course each different plane presented its own installation problems.PRO AVIA 13/711, AIR 2/2274, AIR 18/384 Additionally Keith asked him to prepare a series of diagrams which offered information on a variety of armament subjects.  World War II   Farnborough  In 1939 the Armament Research and Development at the Air Ministry moved to Farnborough and worked with the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE). In August 1940 he arranged trials of an 0.5” machine gun as compared to the standard Browning .303 machine gun because of concerns about the power of the Browning to bring down German planes. Air Chief Marshall Dowding was sufficiently concerned, despite this being the height of the Battle of Britain to attend and he wrote with his impressions to Lord Beaverbrook (then Minister for Air Production) the same day.PRO AIR 16/680 (Later trials showed that the Hispano cannon as developed by Hill's colleague Captain E.S.R. Adams was superior to the 0.5” machine gun.) At the beginning of the war there were problems with the Browning machine gun overheatingPRO AVIA 6/12002 and fouling. Hill was involved in tests on heating and fouling and the introduction of the 1940 muzzle attachment designed by BSA.Wallace Clarke Page 59.  Central Gunnery School  In April 1942 C.H. Keith took command of the RAF's Central Gunnery School then based at Sutton Bridge. He recognised the need for a scientist to explain some of the stranger ballistic effects that were appearing as fighter speeds increased and arranged for Hill to be transferred from Farnborough, initially for a limited time. He remained there until the end of the war when he returned to the Air Ministry which by then had become part of the Ministry of Supply.  Hazel Bertha Hill (daughter)  Hazel (21 July 1920 – 28 September 2010) was only 13 when she helped her father Frederick to calculate how many guns the new generation of Spitfires and Hurricanes would need to have, to bring down enemy aircraft. The pair used 'calculating machines', which were rudimentary computers, at the kitchen table of their London home. Hazel's son Robin, said he thinks his mother enjoyed maths because she was partially dyslexic and had trouble with spelling.

The RAF publicly acknowledged Hazel's important role in a BBC documentary. Captain James Beldon said: \\"What a great inspiration to young people today, and young girls in particular, who can look upon someone like Hazel in the 1930s making such an important contribution to our later success in the Battle of Britain, which was vital to this country's survival.\\"  Later life  After school, Hazel studied medicine at a university in London and joined the Royal Army Medical Corps after graduating in 1943. At the end of the war, she became a GP and in 1948 married Chris Baker, who was one of the soldiers she had treated in the war. The couple moved to Wednesbury, Staffordshire, where Hazel got a job setting up a child health clinic in the newly formed National Health Service. She later trained as a psychiatrist and published research into school phobia, anorexia and autism. Hazel has four sons: Robin, Richard, Frank and Ted. She died, aged 90, in 2010.

Life Giovanni Francesco Morosini was born in Venice on 30 September 1537. He was the son of the Venetian patricians Pietro Morosini and Cornelia Corner, sister of cardinals Luigi and Federico Corner. His father, member of the Council of Ten, committed suicide on 21 March 1570. Still young, he accompanied a relative in France, Alvise Badoer, who had been appointed extraordinary ambassador to that kingdom on behalf of the Republic of Venice. When he returned home, he was sent by the Republic of Venice to Charles II, Archduke of Austria, and on 1 May 1568 he was sent to the court of Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, always as legate, leaving Turin on 29 September 1570. In June 1573 Morosini was sent to Henry of Valois to pay homage to him on behalf of the Republic of Venice in the recent success of his obtaining the Polish crown. In December of that same year, he was appointed ambassador of Venice to the court of Charles IX of France, remaining there until the election of Henry III of France. From 1582 to 1585 he served as bailo to the Sultan Murad III in Constantinople. In early 1585 Pope Gregory XIII selected him as new bishop of Brescia after a secret consultation among the clergy of Venice, and this decision was confirmed by the new pope Sixtus V, who formally appointed him bishop of Brescia on 23 September 1585. Morosini at that time was still a layman, and he was ordained priest on October 1585 in Venice. The episcopal consecration followed on 3 November in the Venetian Church of San Giorgio Maggiore by the hands of Cesare Costa, Apostolic Nuncio to Venice. Sixtus V sent him as his Apostolic Nuncio in France in May 1587. In the France scarred by the Wars of Religion, the duty of the Nuncio was to support the politic of Catherine de' Medici in trying to ally Henry III with the Catholic League led by the Henry I, Duke of Guise against the Huguenots. To support the Catholic war he was allowed by the Pope to sell estates of the Church, but this was fiercely opposed by the French clergy. Nor he succeeded to have the decrees of the Council of Trent published in French. He asked to the Pope to side with Henry III against the Duke of Guise, but this position was not supported by the Pope who more and more became displeased of his nuncio. In the events of the Day of the Barricades he tried to riconciliate the leaders of the Catholic League with Henry III. A few months later, the murders of Louis II, Cardinal of Guise and of the Duke of Guise by order of Henry III marked the failure of his politic. In the meantime, on 15 July 1588 he was elected Cardinal priest with the title of Santi Nereo e Achilleo, in 1590 modified with the title of Santa Maria in Via. Returned in Italy from France in September 1589, he went to Rome where he was charged of not having excommunicated Henry III of France after the murders of the Cardinal and of the Duke of Guise by order of that king. Appointed protector of Germany and Hungary, he was a close friend of San Filippo Neri and his supporter. He died in Brescia on 14 January 1596 and buried in the Old Cathedral of that town. He left his goods to the hospital of Brescia.

Louis- Charles Verwée received his initial art lessons from his father with whom he studies for several years.Louis-Charles Verwée, Citronnade at Galerie Ary Jan He was less interested in the subject matter favoured by his father, i.e. animals and landscapes. He showed more inclination and ability for the painting of portraits and genre scenes. He particularly liked the style of the Belgian painters Alfred Stevens and Gustave Léonard de Jonghe. He subsequently attended the workshops of these two artists. He participated in many Salons, including in Brussels in 1854, in Antwerp in 1861, in Ghent in 1871 and Amsterdam in 1877.Louis-Charles Verwée artist biography at Boon Gallery Work Curiosity Louis-Charles Verwée was a portrait and genre painter. Most of his works depict interior scenes with some anecdotal event. These usually involve young women or children engaged in some mundane activity such as pressing a lemon, reading a book or rummaging through a drawer. He was particularly skilled at capturing the spontaneity of the intimate moments of his characters. He painted portraits mainly of women in a style which is close to that of Belgian painters Alfred Stevens, Gustave Léonard de Jonghe and Charles Baugniet. He is regarded as representing the modern trend in the Classical school together with the Belgian painter Charles Hermans. The artist also created some scenes with lower class characters, such as in The knife sharpener. Belgian king Leopold II acquired his work entitled Diplomacy, which is still in the royal collections.

Biography Born on 6 June 1898 in Innsbruck, Johanna Camilla Piesch was the daughter of Oswald Piesch, a cavalry officer. She was brought up in Vienna where after primary school, she attended secondary school at the Reform Realgymnasium Dr Wesely, matriculating in 1916. She went on to study physics at the University of Vienna, earning a doctorate in 1921. In addition, she received a teaching qualification in mathematics and physics in 1928. She joined the Post and Telegraph Service (Post- und Telegraphenverwaltung) in 1928 but had to take up early retirement in 1938 under the National Socialist regime. In July 1945, she was able to return to work, heading the PTT's laboratory. In February 1956, she moved to the library of the Technical University's documentation centre for technology and science. She retired in October 1962. It appears that after leaving her post in 1938, Piesch was sent to Berlin where she began to work on switching algebra. This is supported by her publications on Boolean algebra in 1939, making her the first person to address its applications. In so doing, she paved the way for the Austrian mathematicians Adalbert Duschek and Otto Plechl who later undertook work on switching algebra. The simplification method put forward in her second publication is of particular note. The last 30 years of Piesch's life were devoted to social work. She died on 28 September 1992 in Vienna. Her work is widely considered of significance to the development of computer science.

She was a winner of the Stefan Banach Prize for mathematics in 1956. Life Zofia Szmydt was born in Warsaw on 29 July 1923. Her mother, Zofia Szmydtowa (née Gąsiorowska), was a historian and philologist. Szmydt studied at the University of Warsaw in clandestine classes during the Second World War. Following the Warsaw Uprising, she and her family were deported to Krakow. In 1946, Szmydt graduated from the Jagiellonian University in mathematics. She defended her doctoral thesis in 1949, written under the direction of Tadeusz Ważewski. Szmydt died on 27 November 2010. Career Until 1952, Szmydt worked at the Jagiellonian University. She was a member of the Mathematical Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences between 1949 and 1971. In 1971, she joined the University of Warsaw where she became a professor in 1984. She retired in 1993. Contributions In her 1951 paper, Sur l’allure asymptotique des intégrales des équations différentielles ordinaires, Szmydt applied the topological method by Ważewski to generalizations of Perron's classic results on the asymptotics of systems of solutions of ordinary differential equations. Szmydt's work on hyperbolic differential equations Sur un problème concernant un systèmes d’équations différentielles hyperboliques d’ordre arbitraire à deux variables indépendantes (1957) proposed a generalised solution for the functional differential equation, which subsumed the Darboux, Cauchy, Picard and Goursat problems as special cases. This was in later literature referred to as the Szmydt problem. Szmydt's textbook Fourier Transformation and Linear Differential Equations (1971) was the first on the topic to be published in the Polish language. Her motivation was to present the basics of the theory of partial differential equations with a particular emphasis on distributions in limit problems of the classical equations (the heat equation, Schrödinger equation, and the Laplace and Poisson equations). In Paley–Wiener theorems for the Mellin transformations (1990), Szmydt gave a full characterization of the space of multipliers for Mellin's distribution in terms of the Mellin transform (equivalent to the Paley–Wiener theorem) and established relationships between Schwartz and Mellin distribution spaces. Honours In 1956, Szmydt won the Stefan Banach prize of the Polish Academy of Sciences for her research into topological methods in nonlinear ordinary differential equations. In 1973, she awarded the Commander's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta for her services to mathematical education.

Marasmius scorodonius) is one of the garlic- scented mushrooms formerly in the genus Marasmius, having a beige cap of up to 3 cm and a tough slender stipe. Description The species can be described as follows: *The cap is red brown (or sometimes beige to ochre) and is hygrophanous, drying to a paler colour. It is sometimes slightly wrinkled and grows to 1–3 cm in diameter. *The gills are white and fairly crowded, and the attachment to the stem varies from adnate to almost free. The spore powder is white. *The stem can grow to 6 cm tall but is only up to 2 mm in diameter. It is bald and pale at the apex, reddish brown lower down, and dark brown or blackish at the base. *The smell and taste are strongly of garlic. *The spores are roughly ellipsoid and measure 7-11 µm x 3-5 µm. *The cheilocystidia (on the gill edge) are of the \\"broom cell\\" type, that is, they are club-shaped with a number of finger-like protuberances. Naming and related species The species epithet is a Latin adjectival form of the Greek word for garlic, scorodon (σκόροδον). This species was originally documented as Agaricus scorodonius by Fries in 1815 and in 1836 the same author established its long- standing designation Marasmius scorodonius. However following a 2005 paper it was decided to separate a group of garlic-smelling species, including this one, off into genus Mycetinis (see that page for more details). Mycetinis virgultorum is (according to Species Fungorum) a closely related species, or (according to Antonín and Noordeloos) a variety within the same species. In the latter classification, the two forms are called M. scorodonius var. scorodonius and M. scorodonius var. virgultorum. The virgultorum form has smaller fruiting bodies, a scaly dull stem, and smaller spores. Ecology, distribution and edibility Fried M. scorodonius This mushroom is found from summer to late autumn especially on conifer needles, but also on sticks and other debris, on bark of conifers and deciduous trees, and on grasses and other plants. While usually a saprophyte, it has also been reported as a parasite of grass. It is fairly common in northern and central Europe, present in the remainder of Europe, and reported from eastern North America, North Africa and Asia, including Israel. The taste of M. scorodonius is often described as nasty or unpleasant, but it is sometimes considered edible and the caps are used to add a garlic flavour to dishes.

The name derives from city of Seyssel, and the family's various branches held the titles of viscounts, earls, barons and marquises over the course of time. Its members were positioned in the first rank at the court of the Counts of Savoy and the bishops of Geneva. Today there are branches of the Seyssel in Italy, Bavaria, Austria and France. History Origins In a history of the Seyssel family, Count Marc de Seyssel-Cressieu (1861-1922) considers it quite possible that the family is related to an early lord of Aix-les-Bains Gauthier d'Aix (Galterius de Aquis) who in 1097 was a witness to a donation made by Humbert II, Count of Savoy to the priory of Bourget. However other Savoy historians question this link maintaining that the Aix title was in the gift of the crown, a view supported by the authors of Histoire des communes savoyardes. Some writers suggest that it may have been a cadet branch of the House of Savoy. The (probable) origin of this family goes back to Humbert (II) of Seyssel, a knight mentioned in 1246 as Lord of Aix and Bourdeau, Count of Novalaise, who paid homage, in 1263, for the domain of Bourdeau. He is a witness to numerous deeds published between 1236 and 1274, notably when the contract of marriage of Amadeus IV was signed in 1244.Act dated 18 December 1244, His brother Gautier is linked in certain documents). It becomes more rigorous with another Humbert de Seyssel, lord of Aix, mentioned in 1330. A powerful regional family The title Count of Novalaise indicates an inferior rank to the Humbertians (the future House of Savoy) and the great regional lords. They held rights over the region of Yenne and probably part of the Savoyard lowlands from the Rhone to Lac d'Aiguebelette in Savoie-Propre, the base of the future County of Savoy. Originally from Seyssel, whose name they bear, they appear to have exchanged it with Aix, an ancient city where the kings of Burgundy owned a residence. This move is considered by historians to have been between 1070 and 1200. The historian Bernard Demotz has promoted the thought that the family may have been related to the early Humbertians, given their location both in Savoie-Propre and neighbouring Bugey. Their control the region was through the construction of castles or buildings to control access to the city of Chambéry, including their strongholds of Aix (at the edge of Lake Bourget), la Bâtie (parish of Barby near Chambéry), Saint-Cassin (also near Chambéry), Aiguebelette (Avant-Pays Savoyard) or Bourdeau (on the banks of Lake Bourget). Their local strength allowed them to join the entourage of the Counts of Savoy and to join the count's council. In 1454 the last member of the House of La Chambre died and their titles and possessions passed to Amédée (or Aymon), son of Marguerite de La Chambre and Jean de Seyssel, Marshal of Savoy, and who joined the Seyssel name with La Chambre. Louis, Duke of Savoy elevated the rank of Seyssel-La Chambre to an earldom on August 1456, and the earldom became a marquisate in 1564. The senior branch of Seyssel, lords of Aix, disappeared in 1509 and their titles and possessions also passed to the Seyssel-La Chambre branch. Françoise de Seyssel-La Chambre was the heiress of her husband Gabriel de Seyssel, her son having died. She appointed as her sole heir her godson Charles de Seyssel-La Chambre, \\"on the express condition that he relinquishes the name and arms of La Chambre and take the name and arms of Seyssel, and that neither he nor his heirs would separate the four baronies of Aix, La Bâtie, Châtillon and Maillonnaz\\". In the next century, following the extinction of this second branch in 1660 and additionally a lawsuit, the marquisate of Aix passed to the junior branch holders of the marquisate of Serraz (1687). It also obtained the marquisate of Sommariva del Bosco during the same period. Titles and Offices The house of Seyssel possessed domains located mainly in the Savoyard state, including the provinces of Savoy Propre, Genevois, Maurienne, Bresse, Bugey and Piedmont, but also the Dauphiné.

After finishing second on his only appearance as a juvenile he developed into a high-class middle-distance performer in the following year when he won the Gordon Stakes, finished second in the St Leger and was placed in both the Dante Stakes and the King Edward VII Stakes. He was even better in the following year when he took the Gordon Richards Stakes, Aston Park Stakes and Hardwicke Stakes before being narrowly beaten by his stablemate Poet's Word in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. He later finished second to Enable in the September Stakes and to Cracksman in the Champion Stakes. In 2019 he won his first Group One race when taking the Prince of Wales's Stakes but was retired to stud in September 2019 after suffered a career-ending leg injury on the gallops. Background Crystal Ocean is a bay horse bred at the Rothschild family's Southcourt Stud near Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire. He raced in the colours of Evelyn de Rothschild and was sent into training with Michael Stoute at the Freemason Lodge Stables in Newmarket, Suffolk. He is from the fourth crop of foals sired by Sea The Stars who won the 2000 Guineas, Epsom Derby and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in 2009. His other major winners have included Harzand, Taghrooda, Stradivarius and Sea The Moon. Crystal Ocean's dam Crystal Star won two races including the Radley Stakes and went on to become a very successful broodmare whose other foals have included Hillstar (Canadian International Stakes), Crystal Capella (Princess of Wales's Stakes) and Crystal Zvezda (Fillies' Trial Stakes). Her dam Crystal Cavern was a half- sister to the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches winner Rose Gypsy. Racing career 2016: two-year-old season On his first and only start as a two-year-old Crystal Ocean was ridden by Ryan Moore when he started the 7/4 favourite for a maiden race over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse on 17 September. After racing towards the rear of the nine-runner field he finished strongly but was beaten a neck into second place by the Richard Hannon Jr.-trained Warrior's Spirit. 2017: three-year-old season On 22 April Crystal Ocean began his second campaign in a maiden over ten furlongs at Nottingham Racecourse and started the 7/4 joint-favourite in a field often. Ridden by Ted Durcan he went to the front approaching the last quarter mile and pulled clear of his rivals before being eased down to win by a length from Okool. Four weeks later the colt was stepped up sharply in class for the Dante Stakes (a major trial race for the Epsom Derby) at York Racecourse in which he was partnered by Andrea Atzeni. Before the race he had attracted significant support in the ante-post betting for the Epsom Derby. In a very strong field for a Group 2 race he finished a close third behind Permian and Benbatl, with Rekindling in third. At Royal Ascot in June Crystal Ocean was made the 9/4 favourite for the King Edward VII Stakes but was beaten into third by Permian and Khalidi. Crystal Ocean's next run was at Goodwood Racecourse when he was ridden by Moore in the Gordon Stakes, a race which often serves as a trial for the St Leger. Starting the 6/4 favourite he reversed the Ascot form as he beat Khalidi \\"comfortably\\" by three and a half lengths despite hanging right (towards the inside rail) in the closing stages. After the race Michael Stoute said \\"He is a horse we've always liked and Ryan has always liked him too... He is very adaptable\\". The 241st running of the St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse on 16 September was described as \\"one of the best and most competitive Legers for years\\". After being restrained by his rider Jim Crowley in the early stages he stayed on strongly to finish second to Capri with Stradivarius and Rekindling in third and fourth. In the 2017 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Crystal Ocean was rated the 90th best racehorse in the world with a rating of 118. 2018: four-year-old season Crystal Ocean was ridden in his first three starts of 2018 by Ryan Moore. On his seasonal debut in the Gordon Richards Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Park on 27 April he started favourite ahead of the Queen's horse Fabricate (winner of the Winter Hill Stakes). After recovering from a poor start he got the better of a \\"good battle\\" with Fabricate to win by a short head. Three weeks later the horse was stepped up in distance for the Aston Park Stakes over one and a half miles at Newbury and went off the 2/5 favourite against four opponents. He took the lead two furlongs out, drew away from his opponents and won \\"comfortably\\" by six lengths from Second Step. Exactly one year after his defeat in the King Edward VII Stakes, Crystal Ocean returned to Royal Ascot and started 4/7 favourite ahead of Idaho, Barsanti (Buckhounds Stakes) and Cliffs of Moher in the Hardwicke Stakes. After racing in second place he took the lead in the straight and stayed on strongly to win by two and a half lengths from the outsider Red Verdon. Stoute commented \\"He's really continued to progress with his racing. He's got a lovely temperament and he's a joy to train. It was straightforward. He is so uncomplicated you can do what you like with him. He is a relaxed horse. It is so far, so good\\". On 28 July, over the same course and distance as his Hardwicke victory, Crystal Ocean was ridden by William Buick and started the 6/4 favourite for the 68th running of the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. He took the lead in the straight and went two lengths clear but was worn down in the closing stages by his stablemate Poet's Word and beaten a neck with the pair finishing nine lengths in front of the other five runners. Stoute commented \\"They are two wonderful, brave athletes. There’s nothing between them really\\". When the interim World's Best Racehorse Rankings were published eight days later Crystal Ocean was rated the fourth best horse in the world behind Winx, Gun Runner and Poet's Word. On his next appearance in the September Stakes on the synthetic polytrack surface at Kempton Park Racecourse on 8 September, Crystal Ocean was asked to concede eight pounds to the 2017 European Horse of the Year Enable. Partnered by David Probert he tracked Enable throughout the race but never looked likely to threaten the filly and was beaten three and a half lengths into second place. Buick took the ride when Crystal Ocean was made second favourite for the Champion Stakes at Ascot on 20 October. He proved no match for the winner Cracksman but kept on well to take second place in the eight-runner field. In the 2018 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Crystal Ocean was placed eighth, with a rating of 125. 2019: five-year-old season As in the previous year, Crystal Ocean began his 2019 campaign in the Gordon Richards Stakes at Sandown in which he was ridden by Moore and went off the 5/6 favourite with the best fancied of his six opponents being Trais Fluors (Prix Paul de Moussac) and Knight To Behold (Prix Guillaume d'Ornano). After tracking the front-running Knight To Behold, Crystal Ocean went to the front two furlongs from the finish and drew away to win \\"very readily\\" by two and a quarter lengths. He continued to duplicate his 2018 programme by running next in the Aston Park Stakes at Newbury in May. Starting at of 2/9 he raced in second place before taking the lead in the straight and came two lengths in front of the Cumberland Lodge Stakes winner Laraaib. On 19 June Crystal Ocean was partnered by Frankie Dettori when he ran for the third time at Royal Ascot and started the 3/1 second favourite behind Magical in the Prince of Wales's Stakes. The other six runners were Sea of Class, Waldgeist, Deirdre (Shuka Sho), Zabeel Prince (Prix d'Ispahan), Hunting Horn (Hampton Court Stakes) and Desert Encounter (Canadian International Stakes). The race was run in challenging conditions in heavy rain on soft ground. Dettori positioned Crystal Ocean in second place behind the front-running Hunting Horn before switching his mount to the wide outside to make his challenge in the straight. Crystal Ocean went to the front two furlongs from the finish and saw off the persistent challenge of Magical to win by one and a quarter lengths with a gap of more than three lengths back to Waldgeist in third. After the race Dettori said \\"He's an ultra-consistent horse, he's a heavyweight of the sport, never runs a bad race... I knew Crystal Ocean stayed really well, so I kicked on early and did not hear anything coming. The rest is history.\\" On 27 July Crystal Ocean made his second attempt to win the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot and started the 7/2 second favourite behind Enable. After racing in mid division he made rapid progress on the outside to take the lead in the straight but was beaten a neck by Enable after a sustained struggle over the final furlong. Crystal Ocean was strongly fancied in the ante-post betting for both the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and the Champion Stakes but he sustained a serious leg injury in a training gallop on 12 September and was immediately retired from racing. A spokesman for Evelyn de Rothschild explained \\"Crystal Ocean has had two screws inserted in a hind cannon bone and has come through the surgery successfully. It should in no way affect his future stud career\\". In the 2019 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Crystal Ocean was given a rating of 128, placing him in a three-way tie for first place alongside Enable and Waldgeist.

The congregation, along with New Light Congregation and Congregation Dor Hadash, which also worshipped in the building, was attacked during Shabbat morning services. The shooter killed eleven people and wounded six. It was the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the United States. Robert Gregory Bowers, 46 years old, was arrested at the scene and charged as the suspect with 63 federal crimes, some of which are capital crimes. He has pleaded not guilty.Torsten Ove, Robert Bowers, accused in Tree of Life synagogue shootings, arraigned , Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (February 11, 2019). He separately faces 36 charges in Pennsylvania state court. Bowers had earlier posted anti-Semitic comments against HIAS (formerly, Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society) on the online social network Gab. Dor Hadash had participated in HIAS's National Refugee Shabbat the previous week. Referring to Central American migrant caravans and immigrants, Bowers posted on Gab that \\"HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in.\\"Why the Pittsburgh shooter is not being prosecuted for terrorism , Times of Israel Background Tree of Life – Or L'Simcha Congregation is a Conservative Jewish synagogue. The synagogue describes itself as a \\"traditional, progressive, and egalitarian congregation\\". It is located in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, east of Carnegie Mellon University and about east of downtown Pittsburgh. The Squirrel Hill neighborhood is one of the largest predominantly Jewish neighborhoods in the United States and has historically been the center of Pittsburgh's Jewish community. About 26 percent of the city's Jewish population live in the area. Originally founded as an Orthodox Jewish congregation in 1864 in downtown Pittsburgh, by an early group of Jewish immigrants, Tree of Life merged in 2010 with the recently founded Congregation Or L'Simcha. The modern synagogue building, located at the intersection of Wilkins and Shady avenues in Squirrel Hill, was built in 1953. The congregation also rents space to Dor Hadash, a Reconstructionist congregation; and New Light, another Conservative congregation. The synagogue's main sanctuary has a capacity of 1,250 people. Squirrel Hill has a low crime rate and is not generally regarded as racially tense. However, local rabbinic student Neal Rosenblum was murdered in the neighborhood in 1986 in an antisemitic hate crime. This 2018 mass shooting took place soon after Columbia University and the Anti-Defamation League independently reported a spike in anti-Semitic activity online, especially on the popular social networking platforms Instagram and Twitter. In addition, other anti-semitic acts had been committed elsewhere. The immediate rise in the months of August to October 2018 was attributed to rising tensions associated with advertising for the 2018 US midterm elections. A similar rise in online attacks had occurred during the 2016 US election, with the midterms being a \\"rallying point\\" for far-right extremists to organize efforts to spread antisemitism online among the populace. In 2017 there was a 57% rise in antisemitic incidents in the United States, in context of rising hate crimes against other groups, including Muslims and African Americans, as reported by the FBI. For instance, hundreds of Jewish gravestones were vandalized in Pennsylvania and Missouri, and antisemitic incidents on university campuses doubled in number. In August 2017, the widely publicized Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia featured Nazi symbols, salutes, and the slogan \\"Blood and Soil\\", amid explicit racist and antisemitic rhetoric. Considerable antisemitic material was being spread online via posted conspiracy theories about wealthy Jewish individuals, including billionaire George Soros. Columbia University's Jon Albright said that these represented the \\"worst sample\\" of all the hate speech he had seen on Instagram. Timeline of Pittsburgh events At 9:45 a.m. three services were underway in the Tree of Life synagogue, which housed three distinct congregations. Tree of Life and New Light had both begun independent Shabbat morning service in the Pervin Chapel and basement, respectively. The Dor Hadash was gathered near the front of the building before their 10:00 a.m. Torah study session. At 9:50 a.m. EDT (13:50 UTC), a gunman described as a \\"bearded heavy-set white male\\" entered the building, opened fire and was \\"shooting for about 20 minutes.\\" He was armed with a Colt AR-15 semi-automatic rifle (cited by authorities as an \\"assault rifle\\") \\\\- NOTE: please see extensive discussion about \\"assault rifles\\" at => Talk:Pittsburgh synagogue shooting#\\"AR-15 rifle\\" considered an \\"Assault Weapon\\" - or Not? and three Glock .357 SIG semi-automatic pistols, all four of which he fired, according to authorities. Approximately 75 people were inside the building at the time. The first two persons shot were the Rosenthal brothers, Cecil and David, at the main entrance, after which the shooter headed downstairs to New Light. Some hearing the shots did not initially recognize them for what they were: Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, located upstairs thought a coatrack had fallen and clattered. By 9:54 a.m., police began receiving multiple calls from people barricaded in the building and reporting the attack. At 9:55 a.m., Melvin Wax, the leader of New Light's services, hid in a pitch-black closet in the basement. He opened the door of the closet, and the shooter immediately shot him. The shooter did not notice the other three congregants who remained in the closet. Two other members of New Light (Gottfried and Stein) were fatally shot and killed in the basement kitchen. The shooter also killed Jerry Rabinowitz of Dor Hadash, a physician who had gone toward the sound of gunshots to see if anyone had been hurt. At 9:57 a.m., the shooter left the basement and headed upstairs to the larger Tree of Life service. About 13 worshippers had gathered for the Shabbat service in an upstairs chapel. Myers helped four of them evacuate the chapel through a side door, but eight of the worshippers remained behind. The shooter killed seven and wounded one. Police sources said the shooter shouted at some point during the attack, \\"All Jews must die!\\" At 9:59 a.m., police arrived at the synagogue. The shooter fired on police from the entryway, while apparently departing, and police returned fire, forcing him to retreat into the building. At 10:30 a.m., tactical teams entered the building and the gunman also fired upon them. When officers wounded him in return fire, he retreated to the third floor and holed up in a room. He wounded two officers and two SWAT members, one of them critically. At 11:08 a.m., the gunman crawled out of the room and surrendered after being shot multiple times. As he received medical care in police custody, he allegedly told a SWAT officer that he wanted all Jews to die, and that Jews were committing genocide against his people; this material was included in a criminal complaint filed in Allegheny County. Victims Memorials to victims outside the Tree of Life synagogue Plaque listing the victims' names. By the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem Eleven people were killed, including three on the ground level and four in the synagogue's basement. Among the dead were two brothers (the Rosenthals) and a married couple (the Simons). At least six others were injured, including four Pittsburgh Police officers. Five people were transported to UPMC Presbyterian Hospital, four requiring surgery, while one was treated and released by the afternoon. Another victim was transported to UPMC Mercy, while the accused was taken to Allegheny General Hospital. Those killed were: * Joyce Fienberg, 75 * Richard Gottfried, 65 * Rose Mallinger, 97 * Jerry Rabinowitz, 66 * Cecil, 59 & David Rosenthal, 54 * Bernice, 84 & Sylvan Simon, 86 * Daniel Stein, 71 * Melvin Wax, 88 * Irving Younger, 69 Of the four injured officers, three were shot (two police officers and one SWAT member) and the second SWAT member was injured by glass fragments.  Accused  Robert Gregory Bowers (born September 4, 1972), a resident of Baldwin, Pennsylvania, was arrested as the suspected shooter. Bowers' parents divorced when he was about one year old. His father committed suicide in October 1979 at the age of 26 while awaiting trial on a rape charge, when Bowers was 7 years old. Bowers' mother married a Florida man when Bowers was a toddler, and he lived with them in Florida until they separated a year after their marriage. Upon returning to Pennsylvania, Robert and his mother lived with his mother's parents in Whitehall. His maternal grandparents took responsibility for raising him, because his mother suffered from health problems. Bowers attended Baldwin High School in the Baldwin-Whitehall School District from August 1986 to November 1989. He dropped out of high school before graduation and worked as a trucker.Pittsburgh Post Gazette, Nov 1, 2018. \\"A high school dropout and trucker, Robert Bowers left few footprints — except online\\" New York Times, Oct 28, 2018, \\"Pittsburgh Synagogue Massacre Suspect Was ‘Pretty Much a Ghost’\\" Neighbors described Bowers as \\"a ghost\\" and said he rarely interacted with others. According to accounts by Bowers' coworkers of 20 years ago, and analysis of his recent social media posts, his conservatism became radicalized as white nationalism; at one point Bowers was fascinated by radio host Jim Quinn. At a later time he became a follower of \\"aggressive online provocateurs of the right wing's fringe.\\" He was deeply involved in posting on websites such as Gab and promoted antisemitic conspiracy theories through such social media sites. Gab has been described as \\"extremist friendly\\" to neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and the alt-right. Bowers registered his Gab profile in January 2018 under the handle \\"onedingo\\"; he described his account by the following: \\"Jews are the children of Satan (). The Lord Jesus Christ [has] come in the flesh.\\" The cover picture was a photo with the number 1488, which is used by neo-Nazis and white supremacists to evoke David Lane's \\"Fourteen Words\\" and the Nazi slogan Heil Hitler. Bowers published posts that supported the white genocide conspiracy theory, such as one that said, \\"Daily Reminder: Diversity means chasing down the last white person\\". Bowers said that supporters of the QAnon conspiracy theory were \\"deluded\\" and being tricked. Bowers was active in posting his own offensive remarks and re-posted content by other similarly minded users, such as Patrick Little, who expressed anti- Semitic, neo-Nazi, white nationalist/supremacist thoughts and denied the Holocaust. Bowers reposted comments in support of the Southern California- based alt-right fight club Rise Above Movement (RAM), who had attended the August 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia and were later arrested by the FBI and convicted at trial for violence against counter- protestors. Bowers posted support of the \\"Western chauvinist\\" Proud Boys (led by Gavin McInnes), who were arrested for violence the same month against Antifa outside the Metropolitan Republican Club in New York City. His posts included criticism of US President Donald Trump for being a \\"globalist, not a nationalist\\" and for supposedly being surrounded by and controlled by Jews. Bowers also attacked African Americans through racial slurs and images related to lynching, and attacked women who have relationships with black men. He used his online accounts to post conspiracy theories regarding philanthropist George Soros. The Times said that security sources had alleged that Bowers had links to the far-right and neo-Nazis in the United Kingdom. A month before the attack, Bowers posted photos of results of his target practice. He also posted a photo of his three handguns, calling them his \\"glock family\\". In the post, he identified the .357 SIG handguns as Glock 31, Glock 32, and Glock 33. Bowers coordinated with Brad Griffin (aka Hunter Wallace) of Occidental Dissent, an alt-right associated blogger and member of League of the South on doxxing an unidentified left-wing blogger. Bowers wrote \\"that address is not the most current for him. I can get you the most recent outside of gab\\". League of the South was one of the organizations that participated in the Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville. In the weeks before the shooting, Bowers made anti-Semitic posts directed at the HIAS-sponsored National Refugee Shabbat of October 19–20, in which Dor Hadash participated. He claimed Jews were aiding members of Central American caravans moving toward the United States border and referred to those migrants as \\"invaders\\". Shortly before the attack, he posted on Gab that \\"HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in.\\" According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, \\"the mention of 'optics' references a disagreement that has raged within the white nationalist movement since the Unite the Right rally in 2017 about how best to get their message across to the general public\\". After the shooting, Gab suspended Bowers' profile and pledged to cooperate with the criminal investigation. Shortly after the attack, PayPal, Stripe, Joyent, and Medium pulled their support for Gab, and GoDaddy, which the Gab domains were registered under, required Gab to relocate their domain name hosting to a different service, effectively shutting Gab down in the short term. Criminal charges and proceedings Federal criminal proceedings Bowers was charged by the U.S. Department of Justice with 29 federal crimes. Bowers appeared in federal court in Pittsburgh on October 29, 2018, and was ordered held without bail pending trial. On October 31, Bowers was indicted on 44 counts by a federal grand jury. The charges carry a maximum penalty of death or 535 years in federal prison. The counts included hate crimes, 11 counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death, 11 counts of use of a firearm to commit murder during a crime of violence, four counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in bodily injury to a public safety officer, and three counts of use and discharge of a firearm during a crime of violence. On November 1, Bowers entered a plea of not guilty. On January 29, 2019, the grand jury indicted Bowers on an additional 19 counts, 13 of which were for hate crimes. On February 11, 2019, Bowers was arraigned in federal court. Bowers is represented by his court-appointed defense attorney, Judy Clarke. Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. A trial date has not yet been set, pending the resolution of various pretrial motions. State criminal proceedings Bowers was also charged with 36 state criminal counts, including 11 counts of criminal homicide, six counts of aggravated assault, six counts of attempted criminal homicide, and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation. The state charges are held in abeyance pending the federal trial. Reactions United States Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf makes a statement about the shooting; Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto stands listening in the striped tie. President Donald Trump, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, Braddock Mayor John Fetterman, and Pittsburgh City Councilman Corey O'Connor released statements about the incident through Twitter. Trump called the shooting a wicked, antisemitic act of \\"pure evil.\\" He also opined that the shooting was preventable: \\"If there was an armed guard inside the temple, they would have been able to stop him\\". Trump suggested cases such as this call for the death penalty. Cecilia Wang of the American Civil Liberties Union said the attack, along with other recent unrest, was inspired by elements of Trump's rhetoric. Vice President Mike Pence denied any such connection in an NBC News interview that night. Over 2,000 people, including many from the local Jewish community, protested against Trump's visit to the synagogue site, chanting \\"words have meaning\\", and carrying signs with such slogans as \\"We build bridges not walls\\". From October 27 to 31, all US flags on public and military grounds were flown at half-staff in memory of the victims. On the Friday following the shooting, David Shribman, executive editor of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, ran the opening of the Hebrew-Aramaic kaddish, often called the Jewish mourner's prayer, as a full-width front-page headline. International The Eiffel Tower in Paris darkened its lights in tribute to the victims of the shooting. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the \\"horrifying anti-Semitic brutality\\", adding \\"the whole of Israel grieves with the families of the dead.\\" Israel's education and diaspora affairs minister, Naftali Bennett, immediately left for Pittsburgh to visit the synagogue, meet with community members, and participate in the funerals of the victims, and directed the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs \\"to assess and prepare to assist the Pittsburgh Jewish community, 'including the need for emergency and resilience teams that immediately left Israel for psychological assistance and community rehabilitation.'\\" Israel's cabinet stood for a moment's silence on October 28 to honor the victims. Chief Rabbi of Israel David Lau said \\"any murder of any Jew in any part of the world for being Jewish is unforgivable\\". He described the location as \\"a place with a profound Jewish flavor\\". Many news reports said he refused to refer to the Conservative congregation as a \\"synagogue\\" since it is non-Orthodox. Prominent non-Orthodox Israeli religious leaders and scholars rejected his statement. Tel Aviv Municipality lit the city hall building with the colors of the American flag in solidarity with the victims of the Pittsburgh attack. An image of the Israeli flag next to the American flag was projected onto Jerusalem's Western Wall. Pope Francis denounced the \\"inhuman act of violence\\" in his Sunday prayers in St. Peter's Square on October 28, and led prayers for the dead and wounded, as well as their families. He asked God \\"to help us to extinguish the flames of hatred that develop in our societies\\". Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs Javad Zarif offered his thoughts and prayers to the victims of the shooting, and said \\"Extremism and terrorism know no race or religion, and must be condemned in all cases\\". Hamas offered condolences and condemned the attack. Jan Kickert, Austrian Permanent Representative to the United Nations, said: \\"The attack ... was an attack on all of us, on what we stand for – religious liberty, human rights. We are committed to the safety and security of Jews wherever they are. I say this with growing up and living with the shame that my forefathers were among the worst perpetrators in Nazi times.\\"Kenneth Bandler (17 December 2018).\\"On My Mind: Shattered glass,\\" The Jerusalem Post. Local Carnegie Mellon University lowered the American flag to half-staff to mourn the victims. People gathered again at the intersection of Forbes and Murray Avenues in front of the Sixth Presbyterian Church on October 30. On the same day, Trump visited Pittsburgh in response to the shooting incident. Immediately after the shooting, the campus of Carnegie Mellon University was placed on lockdown and all university-sponsored activities were cancelled for the day. At the same time residents were advised by police to remain in their homes and stay off the streets. An unusually large proportion of the Pittsburgh Jewish community from all denominations participated in local Jewish rituals related to death and mourning. Jewish tradition requires a person to guard a corpse until it is buried. Shomrim (volunteer guards) took one-hour shifts at the Pittsburgh morgue until the bodies were moved to funeral homes. The Atlantic reported that \\"most of the volunteers appeared to be Orthodox, but they felt strong solidarity with the liberal communities that were directly affected by the shooting.\\" Members of the Pittsburgh Steelers attended the joint funeral service for the Rosenthal brothers on Tuesday, October 30, when NFL teams are traditionally off. The brothers, who were intellectually disabled, had a sister who is a former employee of the team. Media and organizations Many local businesses on Murray Avenue put up posters in support of the victims. The New York Times published an op-ed by Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, that urged readers to fight against antisemitism and hate.Greenblatt, Jonathan. \\"When Hate Goes Mainstream.\\" The New York Times. October 28, 2018. October 28, 2018. A CNN editorial described the shooting as one of three hate- incited acts that took place in the United States in the same week, along with a series of mail bombing attempts and a shooting at a Kroger grocery store in Jeffersontown, Kentucky. On October 28, the Empire State Building darkened its lights in honor of the victims. According to the building's Twitter account, the top of the spire was left aglow with \\"an orange halo shining a light on gun violence awareness\\". In the wake of the shooting, the University of Pittsburgh darkened its traditional Victory Lights atop of the Cathedral of Learning, and on November 2, the university altered the Victory Lights so the blue beam would shine for 11 seconds, one second for each fatality. Sports Sports teams that observed a moment of silence for the shooting victims included the Pittsburgh Steelers at their home game against the Cleveland Browns, the New Orleans Saints at the Minnesota Vikings, the Pittsburgh Penguins at the Vancouver Canucks, the Winnipeg Jets at the Toronto Maple Leafs, the Philadelphia Eagles and the Jacksonville Jaguars playing in London, and the Pittsburgh Panthers hosting Duke at Heinz Field. A moment of silence was also observed before Game 4 of the World Series at Dodger Stadium on the night of October 27. The Pittsburgh Penguins wore jerseys with a patch that read \\"Stronger Than Hate\\" for their game against the New York Islanders on October 30. The team announced that, following the game, the team would auction off the jerseys on behalf of the synagogue. Similarly, the University of Pittsburgh Panthers football team displayed a \\"Stronger than Hate\\" decal on their helmets during the November 2 game visiting the University of Virginia. NFL player Terrell Suggs wore a Star of David on his cleats during a game in October 2019 to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the shooting. Vigils and rallies Pittsburgh locals crocheted or knit forms of the Star of David and hung them along the Murray Avenue. On the evening of the shooting, over 3,000 people gathered at the intersection of Murray and Forbes avenues in Squirrel Hill for an interfaith candlelight vigil; it was organized by students from nearby Taylor Allderdice High School. Two additional vigils were held in the neighborhood. The day after the shooting, an interfaith vigil organized by the regional Jewish Federation was held at Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall, drawing an overflow crowd estimated at 2,500. Attended by numerous national and local dignitaries, the event featured several speakers, including the rabbis of the three congregations that occupied the synagogue building, Islamic and Christian clergy, and civic leaders. Among those in attendance were Bill Peduto, mayor of Pittsburgh; Rich Fitzgerald, Allegheny County executive; Senators Bob Casey and Pat Toomey; Governor Tom Wolf; Naftali Bennett, Israeli Minister for Education and Minister for Diaspora Affairs; Ron Dermer, Israeli ambassador to the United States; and Danny Danon, permanent representative of Israel to the United Nations. A video was streamed during the event featuring Israeli president Reuven Rivlin, who offered brief remarks and led the crowd in a recitation of the Kaddish. In the week following the attack, Jewish and interfaith communal vigils and solidarity rallies were held across the world. In the United States, these were attended by hundreds or thousands of people, in many cities across the nation. In Canada, they were held in Montreal, Ottawa, Halifax, Vancouver and other places. In Israel, approximately 500 Americans and Israelis lit candles on the night of October 28 at Zion Square in Jerusalem. In Europe, Jewish communal vigils were held in London, Liverpool, Brighton, and Paris.Donadio, Rachel. \\"France's Jews Look to Pittsburgh 'Across a Narrow Bridge'\\". The Atlantic. October 31, 2018. October 31, 2018. College students at more than one hundred campuses across the country held vigils in the days following the shootings in memory of the victims. The American Jewish Committee and the Jewish Federations of North America called for Jews and non-Jews to attend synagogue services on the Shabbat following the attack, under the hashtag #ShowUpForShabbat. NBC News reported thousands of people around the world attended services in local synagogues, community centers, and college campuses, including Mayor of London Sadiq Khan. Additionally, many congregations recited the prayer for martyrs Av HaRachamim even though it would normally be omitted that Shabbat. Presidential visit US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania disembark Air Force One at Pittsburgh International Airport On October 30, Trump flew to Pittsburgh on Air Force One, accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump, daughter Ivanka Trump, son-in- law Jared Kushner, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. They went to the synagogue, where they met with Tree of Life spiritual leader Jeffrey Myers and Israeli ambassador to the US Ron Dermer. Trump lit candles for the victims inside and outside placed stones on each of the 11 Star-of-David markers of the memorial. The group went to UPMC Presbyterian Hospital, where Trump spoke with wounded victims, their families, law enforcement officials, and medical staff. Trump's visit was discouraged by some in the Pittsburgh community. Pittsburgh mayor Bill Peduto said Trump should not have come, as the wounds were raw and the community was just beginning to mourn and hold funerals. Peduto, with agreement from Allegheny County executive Rich Fitzgerald, also urged Trump to consider \\"the wills of the families\\" of the deceased. More than 70,000 people had signed an open letter written by Bend the Arc: Pittsburgh saying that Trump was not welcome until he \\"fully denounces white nationalism\\". Former Tree of Life president Lynette Lederman opposed Trump's visit, saying she felt his words were \\"hypocritical\\" and that \\"We have people who stand by us who believe in values, not just Jewish values, but believe in values, and those are not the values of this president, and I do not welcome him to Pittsburgh\\". Before Trump's visit, Tree of Life rabbi Jeffrey Myers said, > \\"There is hate, and it isn't going away. It just seems to be getting worse. > ... We've got to stop hate, and it can't just be to say we need to stop > hate. We need to do, we need to act to tone down rhetoric,\\" adding that he > would welcome a visit from Trump. Aaron Bisno, the rabbi of Rodef Shalom Congregation, said he did not think Trump's presence was beneficial, saying that Trump had become a \\"symbol of division\\" for many. During Trump's visit to the synagogue, an estimated 2,000 protesters were cordoned off a few blocks away. Afterward, Rabbi Jeffrey Myers said, \\"The President was very warm, very consoling.\\"Dailey, Ruth Ann (November 4, 2018). \\"Rabbi, רב, teacher: Rabbi Jeffrey Myers sets an example for all of us\\". Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Neo-Nazis and white supremacists Among American neo-Nazis and white supremacists, figures such as Andrew Anglin of The Daily Stormer, Matthew Heimbach of the now defunct Traditionalist Workers Party, Richard B. Spencer of the National Policy Institute, the freelance writer Tom Sunic, Patrick Casey of Identity Evropa/American Identity Movement, Greg Johnson of Counter-Currents Publishing and the messageboard forum Stormfront expressed fear that the backlash over the attack could derail their efforts to gain mainstream political acceptance. 4chan users on the /pol/ board viewed the attack as \\"accidentally redpilling\\" people and denied that it had occurred. It claimed the purported attack was a \\"false flag\\" committed by Jews to gain sympathy. Some users praised the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting and created the hashtag #HeroRobertBowers to express support for the shooter on Gab. A multiple-choice poll was posted asking for the best option for Jewish people in the West: 35% of respondents chose \\"Genocide.\\" In another poll, the question \\"Do you support the Pittsburgh synagogue shooter, Robert Bowers?\\" was posted; nearly 25% of respondents said yes, and some added inflammatory remarks. Fundraising to aid synagogue and survivors Numerous fundraising efforts were launched to assist survivors of the shooting, burial of the victims, and repairs to the synagogue. As of November 1, a GoFundMe campaign initiated by an Iranian graduate student in Washington, D.C., had exceeded US$1 million in donations, and a new goal of US$1.2 million has also been surpassed. Muslim groups opened a LaunchGood crowdfunding campaign to help pay for the burial of the victims and survivors' medical bills, with the funds to be distributed by the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh. As of November 1, that campaign had exceeded its goal of $150,000 with more than $225,000 in contributions. The campaign announced excess funds would be \\"spent on projects that help foster Muslim-Jewish collaboration, dialogue, and solidarity\\". The Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh raised $3.65 million for victims by November 13; donations to that organization will be matched by the United Way of Southwestern Pennsylvania and the Pittsburgh Foundation. Fundraising campaigns for shooting victims in the Dor Hadash and New Light congregations raised nearly $23,000 combined. A $6.3 million fund was raised for the survivors of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, the families of the 11 dead, and police officers.

She supported a number of Egyptian excavations and donated most of her collection of antiquities to the West Park museum in Macclesfield. Personal life Brocklehurst was one of the eight children of John Brocklehurst, a wealthy Macclesfield silk manufacturer. In 1861 she accepted a marriage proposal from one Henry Coventry, a distant relation of the Earls of Coventry, but her father declined consent; Brocklehurst broke off the engagement. She never married, but from the 1870s shared her life with her companion Mary Booth. Brocklehurst and Booth shared a home, 'Bagstones', at Wincle outside Macclesfield. Brocklehurst died in London in 1898. It is thought she committed suicide. Booth inherited the property and lived there until her own death in 1912. They are buried in the same grave, with a joint gravestone, in the churchyard at Wincle. Egyptology West Park museum, Macclesfield In 1873 Marianne Brocklehurst and Mary Booth ('the two MBs') visited Egypt. While in Egypt, she met Amelia Edwards, another English traveller, and the two parties travelled together in a flotilla up the Nile. Edwards later published her account of the journey in the bestselling A Thousand Miles up the Nile (1877). Brocklehurst's own travel diary of the voyage was published in 2005. Brocklehurst and Edwards competed with each other in the illegal extraction of antiquities from Egypt. Brocklehurst and Booth returned to Egypt in 1876–1877, in 1883 and then for a final time in 1890–1891. On the final trip they witnessed the removal of a large quantity of recently removed 21st Dynasty mummies from Thebes. Brocklehurst was a funder of excavation efforts. She contributed to Edwards' Egypt Exploration Fund, and was an early subscriber to the fund-raising efforts of Flinders Petrie. Through these connections she acquired a number of artefacts. Brocklehurst offered funding to the local council to build a museum to hold these objects, and as a result Macclesfield's West Park museum was opened in 1898. There was some dispute between the Brocklehursts and the council about the building of the museum, and she remained in London on the opening day.

His early life is, at the moment, completely obscure and he only appears on record in 1588 when he rose to the rank of Sergeant major in the regiment of Colonel Bartholomew Balfour. He was promoted to colonel of the first regiment of the Scots-Dutch Brigade in 1606 and held the position until 1636. Thus, he probably holds the record for the longest-serving Scottish colonel during the Eighty Years' War and the Thirty Years' War.  Early Career, c. 1588-1600  Like his early life, Brog's early career is also shrouded in mystery and confusion. On the one hand, James Ferguson records Brog as receiving his commission as captain on 31 March 1590 in succession to Captain David Trail. In the next sentence, Ferguson notes that he was in fact already sergeant-major (the modern equivalent of major) in 1588. That he was a sergeant-major in 1588 is further proved by his commission as sergeant-major, dated to 12 July of that year. The commission stated his pre-existing \\"ability and experience in the conduct of the war, and trusting [his] capacity and diligence\\" therein. Because the commission names Colonel Balfour (who served from 1586-1594), the dating can be taken to mean 1588 and not 1598. Thus, if the dating on the commission is correct, Brog would have been serving long before 1588. Brog was present at the attack of Maastricht in March 1594. He, along with Captain Egger and four Dutch captains were ordered to make an amphibious assault on the suburb of Wyck. However, after some confusion, they heard that the guard in the town had been doubled and the captains decided to call off the attack, Brog insisting he would not \\"lead his men to certain butchery.\\" In 1595, Brog was specially appointed as sergeant-major to an auxiliary force under Justinus van Nassau to relieve Cambrai in a joint effort with Henry IV of France. Brog was also present at the siege of Bommel in 1599 and took a Spanish captain prisoner on an assault on its trenches. Sergeant-Major Brog, along with Colonel William Edmonds, and Captains Caddel, Henderson, and Kerr, was one of the few surviving officers after Nieuwpoort in July 1600, in which seven out of twelve Scottish captains were killed leading up to the siege. In 1599, Brog was recommended by James VI and on 3 June 1600, Brog petitioned for the position of lieutenant-colonel in Col. Edmond's regiment. This, he insisted, was solely for honor, \\"without other pay.\\" This was agreed to by Edmond and the government and by 29 December 1600 Brog was given 600 guilders outright and a salary of 100 guilders per month. Brog wrote to James VI on 24 May 1601.HMC 6th Report: Earl of Moray (London, 1877), p. 668.  The Siege of Ostend, 5 July 1601 – 20 September 1604  Lieutenant-Colonel Brog was present at the Siege of Ostend between 1601-1604. It was there that Brog's hardiness and fortitude was noted in this particularly grim anecdote: Colonel William Brog in 1635, with possible wound on nose from Chatillon's skull. \\"When the gallant Comte de Chatillon, son of the great Coligny, standing on the top of the Sandhill on 10th September, along with Colonel Van der Noot, Colonel Uchtenbrook, and Brogh... [Chatillon] had the top of his head carried off by a cannon-ball, the fragments of his skull wounded Colonel Brogh in the face.\\" See image at left for possible evidence of Brog's wound. In August 1604, Brog and Adolphe van Gelder received instructions on the abandoning of the city. On 22 September 1604, the Scottish and English troops formed the rear-guard, \\"and were the last to leave the ground so long and obstinately defended.\\"  Brog's Regiment: Colonelcy, 1606-1636  Sir William Brog took the colonelcy of the old regiment after the death of its former commander, Sir William Edmond. His salary was raised to 400 guilders/month and he retained command of his company until his death in 1636, despite being reported dead in 1623. Sir John Ogle mentioned Colonel Brog in a letter to William Trumbull in July 1614, Brog had brought news of the king's intentions.A. B. Hinds, HMC 75 Downshire: 1613-1614, vol. 4 (London, 1940), p. 474. In 1617, Brog was requested to resign from the brigade so that Walter Scott, 1st Earl of Buccleuch (whose father, Walter Scott, 1st Lord Scott of Buccleuch had been colonel of the second regiment from 1603-1612) could assume the colonelcy in reparation for debts owed to his father before his death. Perhaps the Earl also assumed he would take command of his father's regiment in 1612 after the Lord's death, but was instead passed up for the far more experienced Sir Robert Henderson. King James evidently believed Brog to be \\"pretty well up in years; and that he should retire from war.\\" The issue continued until at least 1622, when on 30 September Frederick V of the Palatinate wrote to Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia that \\"Colonel Brog will leave his regiment most reluctantly; but still it needs to be reformed.\\" Brog, of course, did not give up his regiment, and thus the third regiment was born in 1629. On 4 November 1631, Colonels William Brog, Sir David Balfour, and George Coutts intervened on behalf of the widow of Reverend Andrew Hunter for a pension of 100 guilders. They promised that they would then provide support for their ministers without help from the state as long as \\"this widow, during the short time that apparently she still has to live, be provided with necessary support.\\" The letter is one of the only known letters to be signed by the colonels of all three regiments of the Brigade. Sir William Brog died by 13 March 1636, ending a 30-year career as colonel and at least 48 years in the Brigade. He was succeeded as colonel by Sir James Sandilands and command of his company went to Captain James Williamson.

(Lawrence Aviation) was an aircraft parts manufacturer which made titanium parts for military aircraft, such as the Grumman F-14 fighter jet. The former owner of the company, Gerald Cohen, was sentenced to one year and a day in prison and ordered to pay $105,816 in restitution for illegal storage of more than 12 tons of hazardous waste on the company's grounds. The abandoned remains of the company, located is off Sheep Pasture Road in the hamlet of Port Jefferson Station, Town of Brookhaven, New York is now one of the most contaminated sites on Long Island and may be responsible for a toxic groundwater plume in the region. The site is bounded by the Long Island Railroad tracks and Sheep Pasture Road to the north. A Long Island Power Authority easement runs along the southern edge of the property, separating the site from a residential area. To the east and west are residential areas. History Lawrence Aviation began operations as Ledkote Products in Port Jefferson Station in 1951 when the facility moved from New York City. The name was changed to Lawrence Aviation Industries in 1959. In May 1980, the Suffolk County Department of Health Services conducted a site visit to Lawrence Aviation Industries. During this visit many areas of concern were identified. There was an accumulation of drums, many improperly stored and in disrepair, in seven areas of the site. Unpermitted discharges of liquid waste were also noted. Unlined cesspools and lagoons were used to store liquid waste. The Town of Brookhaven Department of Environmental Protection tested water from private wells near Lawrence Aviation for volatile organic compounds in 1979. Elevated levels of trichloroethene and cis-1,2-dichloroethene (DCE) were found. The source of contamination was unknown at the time. In 1987, four private wells downgradient of Lawrence Aviation were sampled. High levels of trichloroethene contamination were detected, as well as lower levels of tetrachloroethene and cis-1,2-dichloroethene. Contaminant levels exceeded the NYSDOH public drinking water guidelines. The USEPA supplied bottled water until the homes were connected to the public water supply. Since then, additional contaminated private wells were discovered and connected to the public water supply. Groundwater investigations detected volatile organic compound contamination downgradient of the site. Also, trichloroethene was detected in a downgradient stream and pond. The 2005 Public Health Assessment for the Lawrence Aviation site contained several recommendations, including further investigation to define the extent of the contaminated groundwater plume; assessment of the potential for soil vapor intrusion related to contaminated soil or groundwater at and near the site; and, evaluation of remedial strategies to address any contamination found.

It is a member of the Rams group of card games characterised by allowing players to drop out of the current game if they think they will be unable to win any tricks or a minimum number of tricks.Card Games: Rams Group at www.pagat.com. Retrieved 16 Oct 2018 The game is related to the Swiss Jass form, Chratze.  Cards  Kratzen uses a William Tell pack (German-suited) from which all the Sixes have been removed apart from the 6 or Weli, which has a special role as the permanent, 2nd highest trump. The suits are: Acorns (Eichel), Leaves (Laub), Hearts (Herz) and Bells (Schellen).Kratzen at www.kartenspiele.net. Retrieved 27 Oct 2018 The ranking of the cards is: Sow (also erroneously called the Ace, actually a Deuce) (Sau) > King (König) > Ober > Unter > Ten > Nine > Eight > Seven. In the trump suit, the Weli is just below the Trump Sow.  Playing  The following rules are taken from kartenspiele.net, the source recommended by Geiser. The game is in two phases. In the first phase, players may not drop out and they contribute an ante or antes to the pot. In the second phase, the aim is to win the contents of the pot, but players may drop out for an individual hand if they think they are unlikely to take the minimum number of tricks.  First phase – Muss  The first deal is a 'force' or Muss i.e. everyone has to participate; there is no option to 'drop out'. Each player pays an ante into the pot; the dealer pays double. The dealer shuffles and offer the pack to rearhand to cut. Rearhand cuts and shows the bottom card of the top packet. If it is the Weli, a Sow or a Seven, the cutter looks at the bottom card of the lower packet. Play now proceeds as follows, depending on the cards revealed: * No Sow, Weli or Seven. Dealer deals as normal (see below). * Seven. Dealer passes cards to rearhand (on his right). This is a Hupf i.e. 'hop'. Rearhand pays an ante into the pot and reshuffles as the new dealer. * Single Sow. Hop to left. Forehand pays an ante and reshuffles as the new dealer. * Two Sows. Dealer passes cards via forehand to middlehand (i.e. two places to his left). This is a Sprung i.e. 'jump'. Both forehand and middlehand pay an ante and middlehand reshuffles as the new dealer. * Sow and Seven. The cards are passed, first in one direction, then the other. Forehand and middlehand pay an ante. The role of dealer does not change and the dealer proceeds as normal. * Weli. Dealer deals as normal. Everyone pays an ante. The above process is repeated each time until a normal card is cut. The dealer then deals a packet of 2 cards, in clockwise order, to each player. The next card is flipped. If it is the Weli, another one is turned. Then another packet of 2 cards is dealt to each player. The upcard determines the trump suit and belongs to the dealer. So the dealer will have at least one, and possibly two, extra cards. The dealer now becomes the striker (Schläger), effectively the soloist, and must take at least 2 tricks. He discards one or two cards to reduce his hand to four and leads to the first trick. The others have to take at least one trick. Suit must be followed (Farbzwang), trumps played if that is not possible (Trumpfzwang) and players must head the trick if they are able (Stichzwang). The winner of a trick leads to the next. After 4 tricks have been played, the score is reckoned. If the Striker has not won a minimum of 2 tricks, he pays a penalty of double the pot contents. If a defender has not won at least 1 trick, he pays a penalty equivalent to the pot.  Second phase - normal game  The role of dealer now rotates to the left and the new dealer pays an ante to the pot, shuffles and offers the cards to rearhand to cut. The aforementioned rules for determining the eventual dealer apply and the cards are then dealt. This time the dealer chooses one of the following four contracts: * Schlagen. The dealer chooses to be the striker and has to win at least 2 tricks. * Oder. The dealer changes the trump suit by turning cards from the stock until one is of a different suit from the initial trump card. This new card determines the trump suit. * Weiter-Oder. Only the top card of the talon is turned. Its suit becomes the trump suit and the dealer is the striker. * Weiter. The dealer passes the right to choose a contract to forehand (the player to his right). If other players wish to bid, they must outbid any previously announced contracts. The contracts rank in the above order. Players then decide whether to \\"play\\" (mitgehen) or \\"drop out\\" (Spiel verzichten). In a variant of the rules, a player has the right to announce his decision last; the first one to claim this right has it. Next, the participating players may exchange any number of hand cards for cards in the talon. The first 3 may be exchanged without revealing them. The fourth and fifth cards to be exchanged must be faced up and, for each trump, the player is dealt another card. if the Trump Ace is dealt face up, the player is given 5 extra cards, face down. They can they rearrange their hand and discard excess cards to bring their hand down to four again. A special feature is the Seven Muss (Siebenermuss). If the trump suit has been determined by a Seven, the deal becomes a Muss and is played as in the first phase. Each player only needs one trick to win, regardless of whether they were the striker or not. With the exception of the Seven Muss, the game continues as follows. The striker must win at least two tricks, the other active players at least one. For each trick won, players earn 1/4 of the pot. The indivisible remainder can either remain in the pot or be assigned to the striker If any player fails to achieve his target, he pays an amount equivalent to that already in the pot, or double if he is the striker. If no player has to pay a penalty, the pot is either empty again or contains an indivisible remainder. Then the next round is another Muss. Otherwise another normal game is played.

Sara, sometimes listed as \\"Sarah\\", came from a biracial family, of which both black and white sides owned slaves. Despite this fact, she spent most of her working life to further the cause of freedom and civil rights for African Americans. Her family's wealth and affluence enabled her to obtain a diploma in \\"Ladies Courses\\" from Oberlin College, one of the first colleges in the United States to admit African Americans beginning in 1837. She wrote and published several abolitionist works in journal magazines, but her most famous writing was an address on behalf of the Delaware Ladies' Antislavery Society given at the State Convention of Colored Men during the 1856 election year. After the Civil War, she spent several years working as a teacher for the American Missionary Association, working in the North and in the South educating African-American children.  Early life and education  The house of John Wright Stanly. The Stanly family, both black and white, were founders of New Bern, N.C. Stanley was born in 1837 to a family of free blacks in New Bern, N.C.\\"Stanley, Sara G. (1837–1918)\\", BlackPast.org. Retrieved November 16, 2018. She was one of six children born to Frances \\"Fannie\\" Griffith and John Stewart Stanley. Her father, who added the \\"e\\" back to his last name, was the son of former slave and wealthy plantation owner John Carruthers Stanly and the grandson of white trader and privateer John Wright Stanly, who had originally dropped the \\"e\\" in his family name. Coming from a respected and well-known family allowed the Stanleys to open a school for black children in New Bern. When he wasn't helping his father with his businesses and plantation, John and his wife Fannie were teachers at their school, thus allowing Sara to lead an academic centered life from a young age.\\"Woodward, Sara G. Stanley\\", NCpedia. Retrieved November 16, 2018. As a child, Stanley attended the First Presbyterian Church and sat in one of the back two pews that were purchased by her grandfather John Carruthers Stanly. In New Bern, it was not uncommon to see black and whites worshiping together, because during this time in North Carolina it was illegal for blacks to have their own churches. Oberlin College, circa 1909. At age sixteen, Stanley was sent by her mother to attend Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio. She studied \\"Ladies Courses\\" for three years and earned a diploma that qualified her to teach. Oberlin provided a rare opportunity during the Antebellum period for Stanley to receive an interracial education, thus allowing her to develop her educational activism. The slave uprising in South Carolina blamed on Denmark Vesey in 1822 resulted in new legal restrictions on the free black people in North Carolina. The heightened racial tensions resulting from resentment toward free blacks and the changes in the laws forced Stanley's father and others to close schools for children of color. Afterwards, he moved his family to Delaware, Ohio, in the mid-1850s. Finishing her studies at Oberlin, Stanley moved with her parents to Cleveland, Ohio, where Mr. and Mrs. Stanley opened another school for black children. Stanley continued to teach for them until moving to teach in the public schools.  Abolition work  By the age of 18, like many of the educated free black women of her time, Stanley became an active abolitionist. She had grown up around slaves on her family's farm and had family members who were slaves. An outspoken leader, she earned a position as a representative in the Delaware Ladies Anti-slavery Society. On their behalf she wrote an impassioned speech to be read at the State Convention of Colored Men. The male only crowd gathered to hear forty delegates who were rallying for the cause of black suffrage on January 16–18, 1856. Since women were not allowed inside, her petition was read aloud by delegate William Harris and simply titled: \\"To the Convention of Disenfranchised Citizens of Ohio\\". In the petition, Stanley appeals to the men's Christian faith in support of abolishing slavery and fighting for their rights, declaring that: \\"as Christian wives, mothers, and daughters ... we pledge ourselves to exert our influence unceasingly in the cause of Liberty and Humanity.\\"\\"Speech by Sara Stanley on behalf of the Delaware Ladies' AntiSlavery Society to the 1856 Ohio State Convention\\", ColoredConventions.org. Retrieved November 16, 2018. There is some confusion regarding Stanley's authorship of this petition, as it is attributed to a \\"Sara G. Staley,\\" not \\"Stanley.\\" However, Ellen NicKenzie Lawson argued in her book that \\"the petition has all the earmarks of Stanley's literary style, so it seems likely the typesetter misprinted her last name leaving out the \\"n\\". This petition propelled her into the realm of published abolitionist writers. Among her other works included articles for the Weekly Afro-American and American Missionary and an essay in 1862 on the \\"Brotherhood of Man\\". Later that same year, she was recognized by the National Young Black Men's Literary Association, as an honorary member. In 1867, she wrote a short article in the American Missionary about an interview she conducted with an elderly woman from Mississippi who recalled her sad life as a slave. Horrified by the interview, Sara wrote: \\"Surely many a lessen of patient endurance in the difficulties which beset our work, may we learn from these lowly ones. Pray for me, dear friends. I would be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, but am often weary in flesh and spirit, and cannot always realize the comforting assurance...\\"  Educator of freed people  In March 1864, before the Civil War was over, Stanley joined the Protestant-based American Missionary Association as a teacher for black children living in the South. The purpose of the integrated organization was the \\"abolition of slavery, education of African Americans, promotion of racial equality, and spreading Christian values\\". By May, Stanley was sent to Norfolk, Virginia for her first teaching assignment at the Bute Street School where she worked with African-American students who were recently emancipated during the war.Weisenfeld, Judith. \\"Who Is Sufficient for These Things?\\" Sara G. Stanley and the American Missionary Association, 1864–1868.\\" Church History 60, no. 4 (1991): 493–507. . The war caused several problems for the school due to the constant military presence, the comings and goings of missionary staff unable to deal with the difficulties of the school's conditions, and serious bouts of sickness that would spread throughout the mission. The close living and working conditions also caused serious rifts between the staff of black and white teachers. In one incident, Stanley, along with another black teacher, Edmonia Highgate, wrote a letter to the superintendent of the Norfolk America Missionary Association of Schools in which they criticized the behavior of William Croan, one of their superintendent professors. They claimed he was displaying a \\"prejudiced attitude towards the Blacks he was instructing\\". Another clash occurred involving Stanley and white teacher, Mrs. Gleason who expressed her displeasure with working alongside African-American staff. Gleason wrote letters to the AMA asking that all African-American teachers should be removed from the mission house. Stanley was particularly offended. Because she was so light-skinned, even having blue eyes, she often passed for white. Before Gleason's declaration, Stanley had not drawn attention to her presence and was therefore offended by Gleason's comments. In a letter to George Whipple, the Corresponding Secretary of the AMA, Stanley wrote of the discrimination: \\"these exhibitions of prejudice on the part of the Missionary teachers supposed to be in the work because the love of Christ constrained them is to me very sad to contemplate\\" and \\"Oh the profound wisdom of this prejudice against color! When one half shade difference is to determine whether an individual is to be respected or despised\\". Her troubles compounded as the combination of her outspokenness and light-skin got her labelled as \\"haughty\\", not only with the white staff but at least one other black teacher as well. Miss Gleason partnered with Clara Duncan, a black teacher and Oberon graduate, and together they accused Stanley of having an affair with another AMA teacher, Samuel Walker, who was white and married. Walker resigned his post over the scandal. Although Stanley was allowed to stay with the AMA after the incident, two months later, she was sent to work St. Louis, Missouri, where her next school was a \\"small, windowless room in a church basement\\". The school was run and paid for by the local Colored Board of Education. There was very little money and supplies, but Stanley was impressed by her interactions with the students. She wrote in her report to the AMA \\"the preponderance of the mulattoes over the blacks immediately arrests the attention of the spectator ... The Caucasian element is largely ascendant, many of the children have blond and red hair and the peculiarly white transparent complexion which is their usual accompaniment. A woeful commentary on the hideous iniquity of Slavery.\\" In the two months she was assigned to the school, she grew the program by using her own money to buy supplies, and she had started a successful Sunday school. During her time there, the AMA was slow to send her salary and travel money, but Stanley refused to take tuition from indigent students. The same year the Civil War was over, \\"the school board changed in the fall of 1865 from an all-black to all-white board\\". The new white school board members wanted to replace the colored staff with white teachers. They forced Stanley to be reassigned, and she left in debt. Her next assignment was in Louisville, Kentucky, where, she taught in the basement of the Centre Street Colored Methodist Church run by the Colored Board of Education. Despite the harsh conditions of the basement, she helped grow attendance, and by May 1866 she was made principal. When the federal Freedman's Bureau took over under the new public school system, Stanley again found herself without a school. By 1868, she moved to Mobile, Alabama again as a teacher for the AMA. Stanley remained with the AMA until she left Mobile, Alabama in 1870.  Family life  While on assignment for AMA in Alabama, 1868, Stanley met Charles A. Woodward, a white man who served in the Union army during the war. Charles, a trained mason, worked as a cashier at the Freedmen's Bank after the war. When he met Sara, he was four years her junior. Despite the fact that she was so fair and both of them had blue eyes, he was still white and she was acknowledged to be a proud black woman. There is historical disagreement over whether or not the AMA supported her pending nuptials, but what is clear is the AMA feared retaliation from the local Ku Klux Klan. To complicate the event, the Association had just purchased a new building to expand the school. Local whites were already critical over the expansion of colored education and were further agitated over the rumors of the possibility of the Woodwards marrying in the new Mission House. The situation resolved itself when the wedding \\"quietly\\" took place at a friend's house. Despite the initial notoriety of their marriage, the Woodwards spent several more years working and living in Mobile. Sara continued to teach with the AMA, moving to their training center at the Emerson Institute. She also worked part time with her husband at the Freedman's Bank as a cashier. At some point before leaving Mobile, Sara gave birth to a baby girl. For some unknown reason, the baby died at six months old. In 1874, Charles, who was the head cashier at the Freedman's Bank, was accused of embezzlement. Following a brief trial, he was found not guilty. Soon afterwards, the Woodwards moved to New Jersey, where according to several census records, they both listed themselves at \\"white\\". Charles died in 1885.  Late life and death  Sewing class at The Haines Normal and Industrial Institute, Augusta, GA, circa 1900. After her husband's death, Stanley moved to Philadelphia, where she continued to receive her husband's military pension of $8 a month and worked as an engraver to supplement her income. In 1894, she briefly taught with notable abolitionist and educator Lucy Craft Laney at a small school for black women in Augusta, Georgia. At the time, the school was called \\"The Haines Normal and Industrial Institute\\", but in 1949 it was renamed \\"The Lucy Craft Laney Comprehensive High School\\".'' Little is known about her later life, but as part of the 1910 Census, Sara was again living in Cumberland County in New Jersey. It lists that she had 3 children, but 0 living. Sara Griffith Stanley Woodward died in 1918 at the age of 82. Her resting place is unknown.

It was originally established as the Women's University Settlement in 1887, and focused especially on the needs of women and children. It was part of the settlement movement promoted by Rev Samuel Barnett who prompted young people with university educations to settle in the worst areas of poverty. The Women's Library has an archival collection of documents related to the group. History The Women's University Settlement was founded after a talk by Henrietta Barnett to the Cambridge Ladies' Discussion Society. Toynbee Hall had been founded in 1884, and female students resolved to set up a similar project. Representatives from Girton College and Newnham College at Cambridge University, and Lady Margaret Hall and Somerville College at Oxford University, formed the Women's University Association. A Newnham student Alice Gruner was appointed Head Worker, and the organization was based at her house at 44 Nelson Square, Southwark. Other Newnham students involved in the venture included Mary Paley Marshall, Nora Sidgwick, and the Prime Minister's daughter Helen Gladstone. Octavia Hill, who became a housing reformer and founder of the National Trust, was also an active member. In 1888 the Association was renamed the Women's University Settlement. Gruber resigned as Warden, and in 1891 a paid Warden, Margaret Sewell, was appointed. By 1895 the Settlement had 31 resident and 61 non- resident workers. It organized children's clubs, holiday treats and classes in music and dance for local children. Helen Gladstone served as Warden in the early twentieth century. By 1912 the Settlement had started to train social workers for work elsewhere. However, its lack of institutional funding forced a public appeal for funds, to buy a hall and ensure a secure financial footing.Avebury, Thomas Barlow, Charles Booth, C. Roden Buxton, Helen Gladstone, Alfred Marshall, Henry A. Miers, Henry E. Roscoe and Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick, 'The Women's University Settlement In Southwark', The Times, 3 June 1912, p. 7. In 1926 the Settlement's activities included a baby centre, a mixed children's club for boys and girls, the Southwark Boys' Aid Association, work on care committees and remedial exercises and light treatment for children. Graham Wallas, presiding at the organization's AGM, saw it as exemplifying the way in which social work had moved from Victorian amateurism to professional activity on scientific lines.\\"Women's University Settlement: Professor Graham Wallas on Social Work\\", The Times, 24 March 1926, p. 18. Wyndham Deedes reported ongoing growth at the 1929 AGM: a nursing school, a clothes sale section and a legal aid department had been established, and the number of children under the Settlement's infant welfare section had risen to 1,200.'Women's University Settlement', The Times, 21 March 1929, p. 13. In 1961 the group's name was changed to Blackfriars Settlement in respect to men's involvement and to be more inclusive of local community involvement. The organization moved into the Rushworth Street building in 1992, a purpose-built structure that replaced a run-down Georgian Town House. It in turn became dated with leaks in its flat roof and Blackfriars rented accommodations on at Suffolk Street while renovations took place. Baronness Margaret Wheeler who heads UNISON and serves in the House of Lords is the group's trustee and chair. In 2010, the organization moved its headquarters to Great Suffolk Street. Workers on the nearby Blackfriars Station made a donation to the charity. Rev. Mark Beach became the group's director in 2015 succeeding Julie Corbett-Bird. In 2019, the organization received funding for pop-up friendliness cafés.

Between the wars it converted to the anti-aircraft (AA) role and was captured in Java during World War II. Its successor unit continues in Britain's Army Reserve today. Origin The creation of the Territorial Force under the Haldane Reforms of 1908 saw a widespread reorganisation of existing Volunteer Force units. One new unit formed was II (or 2nd) Welsh Brigade, Royal Field Artillery. The bulk of the personnel came from the 2nd Volunteer Battalion Welsh Regiment based in Cardiff, originally raised as Rifle Volunteers in 1859, some of whom had seen active service during the Second Boer War. (Other members of this battalion joined the Glamorganshire Royal Horse Artillery, the remainder formed the 7th (Cyclist) Battalion, Welsh Regiment.) One battery of the new field artillery brigade was provided by the 1st Cardigan Royal Garrison Artillery (Volunteers), which had been formed at Aberystwyth, Cardiganshire, on 28 June 1901 as the Volunteers expanded during the Boer War. This had consisted of two 'position batteries' (later 'heavy batteries'). The new brigade had the following organisation:London Gazette, 20 March 1908.Frederick, pp. 296, 651, 682.Army List, various dates.Litchfield & Westlake, p. 37.Litchfield, pp. 79–80.Westlake, pp. 93-4. * Headquarters (HQ) at Drill Hall, CardiffCardiff at Drill HallProject. * 3rd Glamorganshire Battery at Drill Hall, Cardiff * 4th Glamorganshire Battery at Drill Hall, Cardiff * Cardiganshire Battery at Glyndwr Road, AberystwythAberystwyth at Drill Hall Project.Cardiganshire at Great War Centenarr Drill Halls. * 2nd Welsh Ammunition Column at Drill Hall, Cardiff The unit was part of the TF's Welsh Division. The batteries were each issued with four 15-pounder guns.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 117–23.53 (W) Division at Long, Long Trail.Conrad, British Army, 1914. Joshua Pritchard Hughes, Bishop of Llandaff, was appointed chaplain to the new brigade, with the rank of chaplain 1st class (TF). As a young clergyman he had been appointed chaplain to the 2nd Volunteer Battalion on 10 December 1876 and maintained the link as he rose in the church. World War I 15-pounder gun, issued to the Territorial Force. Mobilisation After the order to mobilise was received on 4 August 1914, the units of the Welsh Division assembled at their drill halls. The 2nd Welsh Brigade mobilised at Cardiff under the command of Lt-Col H.T. Gilling, TD, who had been CO since 1913. By 11 August the units had completed their concentration and TF members were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service. Four days later the War Office issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units, and on 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way duplicate batteries, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6. 1/II Welsh Brigade, RFA 18-pounder preserved at the Imperial War Museum. At the end of August the Welsh Division concentrated at Northampton to continue its training. On 18 November the division was warned for garrison duty in India, but this was cancelled and in December it moved to Cambridge, then to Bedford in May 1915. In July the infantry of the division (now renamed the 53rd (Welsh) Division) embarked for service at Gallipoli, but the divisional artillery remained at Bedford. In October the batteries were re- armed with modern 18-pounder guns and on 8 November they handed over their obsolescent 15-pounders to the 2nd Line unit, which had just arrived at Bedford.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 83–90. 53rd (Welsh) Divisional Artillery was now ordered to France to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front. It embarked on 20 November and had concentrated at Pont-Remy by 25 November, from where parties were sent to various divisional artilleries for instruction in front line duties. Meanwhile, after suffering appalling casualties at Gallipoli, 53rd (Welsh) Division had been withdrawn to Egypt to refit. On 30 January 1916 the divisional artillery was ordered to rejoin the rest of the division. The batteries entrained at Pont-Remy, embarked at Marseilles on 3 February and disembarked at Alexandria on 11 February. By 22 February the artillery had rejoined the division at Beni Salama. For the rest of the year the recuperating division was stationed in the Suez Canal defences. In May 1916 the TF field brigades were numbered, the 1/II Welsh being designated CCLXVI Brigade, RFA, (266 Brigade) and the batteries became A, B and C. Then on 25 December 1916 the divisional artillery was reorganised: A Bty of CCLXVI Bde was broken up between B and C Btys (to make them up to six guns each) and they were redesignated A and B, while the brigade was redesignated CCLXVII Brigade, RFA (267 Bde). 53rd (W) Divisional Ammunition Column had remained in France, and was reformed in Egypt by abolishing the Brigade Ammunition Columns.Frederick, p. 694.Ward, p. 66. Palestine 18-pounder gun in Sinai. Early in 1917 the Egyptian Expeditionary Force launched the Sinai and Palestine Campaign by crossing the Sinai desert and advancing against Turkish forces at Gaza City, but CCLXVII Bde remained in the Suez Canal defences and missed the First Battle of Gaza.Ward, pp. 67, 83.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, p. 81. The brigade rejoined the division on 19 April while the Second Battle of Gaza was in progress, but although it crossed Wadi Ghuzzeh and took up position, it did not fire a shot in the action. Infantry casualties had been high and gains minimal, and the EEF dug in for a summer of trench warfare.Ward, p. 100.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, p. 87. Although the War Office was unable to provide more divisions for the EEF, it could send guns: 53rd (W) Division's batteries were temporarily brought up to a strength of eight rather than six guns, until further troops arrived.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 90–1, 93. The reorganised EEF renewed its offensive (the Third Battle of Gaza) on 27 October. XX Corps, including 53rd (W) Divisional artillery, moved into position during the night of 30/31 October to capture Beersheba, and the bombardment began at 05.55. After a pause at 07.00 to let the dust settle and determine the effect, the guns reopened. Infantry parties advanced to within of the barrage to finish cutting the barbed wire. They then rushed Point 1069 and the 18-pounder batteries began to move up to more advanced positions. Beersheba had fallen to the Desert Mounted Corps and XX Corps could bivouack on the objective.Falls, Vol II, pp. 44–7.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 98–9. On 3 November 53rd (W) Division was ordered to advance to the Tel es Sheria road. The right column consisted of 160th (South Wales) Brigade but only one battery of CCLXVII Bde because of the shortage of water for the horses. It was a difficult march over broken country in hot weather and the gunners had to haul their guns up to the head of the valley to get in range of the Khuweilfe heights. 160th Brigade met determined opposition and could not clear the wells at Khuweilfe before nightfall. The attack was renewed at 05.00 next morning, but the artillery support ceased when the ammunition wagons could not get up to the guns, and the infantry only got as far as Hill 1706. However, on 6 November the division assaulted the Khuweilfe position supported by an intense bombardment by all its own guns and a heavy battery. After confused fighting the position was held, with the support of the divisional artillery breaking up Turkish counter-attacks.Falls, Vol II, pp. 84–7, 94.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 104–5.Ward, pp. 127–37. 18-pounder with sand wheels. After breaking through the Gaza positions, the EEF pressed on to Jerusalem in appalling weather. XX Corps sent forward a flying column known as 'Mott's Detachment' that included 53rd (W) Division. Jerusalem fell on 8 December, but there was still heavy fighting to the end of the year as the Turks threw in counter- attacks.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 113–6.Falls, Vol II, pp. 238–44. 250–1, 281–2. XX Corps renewed its advance in March 1918, 53rd(W) Division pushing forward a little on 2 March, then again on 6 March against only slight opposition, before the whole Corps advanced on 8 March. 53rd (W) Division's main objective was the hill of Tell 'Asur, and it was supported by plentiful artillery as well as its own field brigades. The peak was taken, lost, and retaken, followed by four more unsuccessful Turkish counter-attacks. That night the division also took Chipp Hill, which had defied the neighbouring division during daylight, but on 10 March found the wadi in front too steep to climb, only passing over it during darkness on 12 March. The new line was held through the summer months.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 113.Falls, Vol II, pp. 312–21. In April a large number of formations and units were stripped from the EEF to reinforce the BEF on the Western Front following the German Spring Offensive. 53rd (W) Division took over a section of the line from 74th (Yeomanry) Division on 9 April, with 160th Infantry Bde and CCLXVII Bde taking over the right sector.Ward, p. 211. 4.5-inch Howitzer with 'ped-rails' (sand tyres) around wheels. Unlike most RFA brigades, which had gained a howitzer battery in the 1916 reorganisation, CCXLVII had remained without one. On 8 April 1918 it was joined by 439 (Howitzer) Bty, equipped with four 4.5-inch howitzers passed over by CXVII (H) Brigade in 74th (Y) Division. The new battery had been specially formed with personnel drawn from 53rd (W) and 60th (2/2nd London) Divisional Ammunition Columns and from 9th Mountain Battery, RGA. In the summer of 1918 the 53rd Division was 'Indianised', with three quarters of the infantry battalions sent to the BEF and replaced by others drawn from the British Indian Army, but this did not affect the divisional artillery, which retained its composition to the end of the war.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, p. 124. At the climactic Battle of Megiddo 53rd Division attacked late on the first day (18 September), after a 20-minute bombardment. The sound of the infantry's approach march had previously been drowned by slow shellfire on Keen's Hill. The gunners then fired smoke shells to guide the infantry's advance in the moonlight. One Turkish position held out, and a new attack was arranged for 19 November. During the afternoon a party of Turks was found eating lunch in the open, and every field gun in range was called in to destroy them. When the attack went in at 19.00 it was completely successful, the main enemy position was taken and the guns could move forward. The pressure was kept up on 20 September: 160th Bde was involved in severe fighting without artillery support while the guns were moving up, and was driven off Gallows Hill. But then CCLXVII Bde came into action with a half- hour bombardment of Gallows Hill, breaking up a Turkish counter-attack that was being prepared, and demoralising the defenders of the hill, which was quickly reoccupied. By the end of the next day the Turkish army was shattered, and a general advance was ordered.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 129–34.Ward, pp. 232–9. After the battle the division was withdrawn to Alexandria before the Armistice of Mudros came into effect on 31 October. Demobilisation began on 20 December and was completed in June 1919. CCLXVII Brigade was placed in suspended animation. 2/II Welsh Brigade, RFA French De Bange 90 mm gun Although 2/II Welsh Bde was raised at Cardiff as early as 14 September 1914, the 2nd Welsh Division (68th (2nd Welsh) Division from August 1915) did not concentrate at Northampton until Spring 1915, the brigade joining it on 29 April. It moved to Earlswood on 4 August 1915 and then arrived at Bedford to replace the 1st Line brigade on 2 November. Training of the units was made difficult by the lack of arms and equipment, and the requirement to provide drafts to the 1st Line overseas. In June the first saddlery and horses began to arrive, but no guns until August, when the brigade received four French De Bange 90 mm guns. Some ammunition wagons arrived in September, and eight more 90 mm guns in October. Training began to speed up, with the 90 mm guns standing in for 15-pounders. When the brigade arrived at Bedford it took over 12 x 15-pounders from the 1st Line. In December 1915 these in turn were replaced by modern 18-pounders.RFA at When the Welsh Came to Bedford. 68th (2nd Welsh) Division had been assigned a role in Home Defence in November when it joined First Army (Home Forces) in Central Force, with its units quartered across Eastern England. In May 1916 the brigade was numbered CCCXLI Brigade (341 Bde) and the batteries became A, B and C. The Home Defence divisions continually supplied drafts to units fighting overseas, and CCCXLI Bde had disappeared from 68th (2nd W) Division's order of battle by mid-1917. Interwar 82nd (Welsh) Field Brigade, RA The 2nd Welsh Brigade, RFA, was reformed in the 53rd (W) Division on 7 February 1920, with 5th–8th Glamrgan Batteries (the Cardigan Battery was not reformed). It was redesignated the 82nd (Welsh) Brigade, RFA, when the TF was reorganised as the Territorial Army (TA) in 1921 (becoming a Field Brigade, RA, in 1924 when the RFA was subsumed into the Royal Artillery). It had the following organisation:Frederick, p. 522.Titles and Designations, 1927. * HQ at Dumfries Place, Cardiff * 325 (Glamorgan) Bty * 326 (Glamorgan) Bty * 327 (Glamorgan) Bty * 328 (Glamorgan) Bty (Howitzer) 77th (Welsh) HAA Regiment, RA In the late 1930s the need for improved anti-aircraft (AA) defences for Britain's cities became apparent, and a programme of converting existing TA units was pushed forward. On 1 November 1938 the unit became 77th (Welsh) AA Regiment, RA, with the following organisation:Frederick, pp. 755–9, 774.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files. * HQ at Dumfries Place, Cardiff * 239 (Glamorgan) AA Bty at Dumfries Place * 240 (Glamorgan) AA Bty at Dumfries Place * 241 (Glamorgan) AA Bty at Drill Hall, Pentre, Rhondda * 242 (Glamorgan) AA Bty at Drill Hall, Pentre, Rhondda World War II Mobilisation The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62–3. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65–6, 371. 3-inch HAA gun of AA Command, 1940. Phoney War 77th (Welsh) AA Regiment came under the command of 45th Anti-Aircraft Brigade based at Cardiff and forming part of 5th Anti-Aircraft Division.45 AA Bde War Diary, 1940, The National Archives (TNA), Kew file WO 166/2285.Routledge, Table LX, p. 378. In mid-May 1940, as the Battle of France got under way, 45 AA Bde's units were ordered to find rifle detachments to guard against possible attacks by German paratroopers. The brigade also had to lend 240 AA Bty of 77th AA Rgt, with a Gun-laying radar (GL) detachment, to reinforce the defences of Littlehampton on the South Coast of England. Battle of Britain Preserved static 3.7-inch gun. On 1 June all AA regiments equipped with 3-inch or the newer 3.7-inch guns were termed Heavy Anti-Aircraft (HAA) to distinguish them from the new Light Anti-Aircraft (LAA) units being formed.Litchfield. In August and September 1940, the Cardiff Gun Defence Area (GDA) had 26 HAA guns.Collier, Appendix XXII. The number of raids over South Wales, and the number of times the guns engaged, increased sharply during August. At this time, 77th (W) HAA Rgt was deployed as follows: * 239 HAA Bty ** The Bulwarks, Porthkerry – 4 x static 3.7-inch, later 8 x 3.7-inch with GL ** Sully – 4 x 3.7-inch * 240 HAA Bty ** Llwyn-y-Grant, Cardiff – 2 x 3-inch, ** New House, Newport – 2 x 3-inch, 2 x 3.7-inch, later 4 x static 3.7-inch * 241 HAA Bty – detached to 4th Anti-Aircraft Division * 242 HAA Bty ** Ely Racecourse, Cardiff – 4 x 3.7-inch ** Intake, West Llandaff – 2 x 3.7-inch 3.7-inch gun emplacements at Lavernock Battery By late September, 242 HAA Bty had moved to: ** Lavernock Fort, Penarth – 6 x static 3.7-inch with GL ** Merry Harriers, Cardiff – 4 x mobile 3.7-inch and 241 HAA Bty had returned and taken over: ** Mardy Farm – 4 x static 3.7-inch ** Llwyn-y-Grant, Cardiff – 2 x 3-inch, later 2 x 3-inch joined from New House, while 240 HAA Bty had taken over: ** Pye Corner, Cardiff – 4 x static 3.7-inch with GL Blitz Formation sign of 9 AA Division. Following the Luftwaffe's defeat in the Battle of Britain, it began heavy night attacks on Britain's cities ('The Blitz'). At first the towns of South Wales, including important coal and oil port facilities, refineries, steelworks and ordnance factories, were under almost nightly air attack, to which the AA defences replied as best they could. In the absence of effective GL radar control, at night the guns could only reply blindly with fixed barrages.Sainsbury, pp. 72–4, 79.Pile's despatch.Routledge, p. 391. There was a lull in the intensity of raids on South Wales from late September as the Luftwaffe concentrated on London and the industrial cities of the English Midlands, but there was a flare-up in activity over South Wales in late October. Some of this was aircraft dropping Parachute mines in the Bristol Channel, which were plotted by the HAA batteries' GL sets. In November the AA guns began to claim some hits from GL-controlled fire – 239 HAA Bty claimed one aircraft shot down from the Bulwarks on the night of 7 November, and the 'Ball of Fire' concentrated barrage over Cardiff claimed another the next night.Sainsbury, pp. 75–6. As AA Command's resources expanded, 5 AA Division's responsibilities were split in November 1940 and a new 9 AA Division was created to cover South Wales and the Severn Valley. 45 AA Brigade was transferred to the new formation.Routledge, p. 394.Sainsbury, p. 77.Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex D, p. 258.Routledge, Table LXV, p. 396. There were heavy night raids on Cardiff on 2 January, 3 and 4 March 1941 (the Cardiff Blitz), with frequent smaller raids.Collier, Chapter XVII.Collier, Appendix XXX. By the end of February 1941 the HAA guns (3-inch, 3.7-inch and 4.5-inch) in the Cardiff GDA only numbered 52 out of a planned establishment of 64. This increased a month later to 56 guns, though further additions to the establishment were already being called for.Collier Chapter 18. On 26 March 1941, 242 HAA Battery was sent to reinforce 62nd (Northumbrian) HAA Rgt in the Humber Gun Zone under 39 AA Bde. It then went to Southend-on-Sea.39 AA Bde War Diary 1939–41, TNA, file WO 166/2272. It had returned to regimental command by early May, when the Blitz came to an end.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/79. The regiment sent a cadre to 206th HAA Training Rgt at Arborfield, to provide the basis for a new 457 Bty; this was formed on 10 July 1941 and joined the newly-formed 132nd HAA Rgt. As the flow of new AA units from the training centres continued, experienced units began to be prepared for overseas service, and 77th (Welsh) HAA Rgt was one of these. The war establishment for regiments overseas was only three batteries, and 242 HAA Bty was formally detached in early June 1941. It went to Egypt where it joined 51st (London) HAA Rgt.Frederick, p. 767 (1947 date apparently incorrect).Routledge, Table XXIV, p. 162. By October 1941, 77th HAA Rgt was part of the War Office Reserve, ready to embark.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional units), 22 October 1941, TNA files WO 212/6 and WO 33/1883. Java The Japanese invasion of Java. The regiment sailed on 6 December aboard Convoy WS14 to join Middle East Forces, but on 9 January 1942, while still at sea, it was diverted to the Far East following the Japanese invasion of Malaya. The convoy arrived at Singapore on 13 January, but most of the regiment's equipment went on to the Middle East, and it had to be re-equipped from the stockpile at Singapore. The airbases at Singapore were under heavy attack and the RAF redeployed its aircraft to the Dutch East Indies: the AA units aboard WS14 were diverted again, sailing on 30 January and arriving at Batavia on Java on 3/4 February.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 231.Farndale Far East, pp. 42, 53, 70.Joslen, p. 558.Routledge, pp. 221, 225.Woodburn Kirby, p. 258. As the regiment began to unload from the ships at Batavia on 4 February, it came under immediate air attack. Once the confusion cleared, the AA units deployed around the harbour. Then 16 AA Bde (whose HQ had disembarked at the same time) arranged for them to be sent to defend the most important ports and airfields. 77th HAA Regiment (less 239 HAA Bty left to defend Batavia) was sent to the naval base at Surabaya. Part of the regiment boarded an express train for Surabaya, but on the way it collided with a goods train, and three officers and 12 other ranks were killed, and another 60 officers and men injured.Farndale, Far East, p. 71.Routledge, pp. 225-8. When the Japanese attack on Java began, 77th was the only fully equipped HAA regiment available; although two batteries of the Regular Army 6th HAA Rgt had been evacuated from Sumatra before it was captured, they had no guns and were sent to defend airfields as infantry. 77th HAA Regiment was in actionwas soon in action at Surabaya, claiming three bombers shot down.Farndale, Far East, pp. 75–7.Walker, pp. 150–1.Woodburn Kirby, p. 436. Japanese landings on Java began on 1 March near Batavia, covered by bombing raids, with the airfields as their primary target. 77th HAA Regiment was forced to withdraw from Surabaya to Tjilatjap in the face of strong attacks, and one Troop was cut off and lost at Surabaya. 'Blackforce', a mixed force of Australians and British commanded by Brig Arthur Blackburn, VC, kept up an active defence for several days, but the Dutch commander ordered his units to cease fire on 8 March, and the remnants of 16 AA Bde including 77th HAA Rgt surrendered on 12 March, after destroying their guns. No records of the AA engagements over Java have survived, but 16 AA Bde claimed to have destroyed 26 Japanese aircraft.Woodburn Kirby, pp. 436, 444–5, 448–9.Walker, pp. 150–62. The survivors of 77th (Welsh) HAA Regiment and the other British troops on Java spent the next three-and-a-half years as Prisoners of War (POWs), held in atrocious conditions. Large numbers died as a result of disease, overwork, brutal treatment, or shipwreck.Walker, pp. 163–273. The regiment, with 239, 240 and 241 Btys, was formally placed in suspended animation from 12 March 1942. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947, the regiment was reformed as 282nd (Welsh) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment (coincidentally, its old number 77 was taken by the Regular Army 6th HAA Rgt alongside which it had served in Java). The regiment was part of 71 AA Bde (the prewar 45 AA Bde) at Cardiff.Frederick, p. 957.Frederick, p. 1001.Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex M.Watson, TA 1947.Litchfield, Appendix 5.266–288 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 onwards.67–106 AA Bdes at British Army 1945 onwards.Routledge, Table LXXIV, p. 441.

Originally she served on the Irish Station. However, she was in the Mediterranean serving as a tender to when a Spanish privateer captured her in 1806 in a single-ship action. Capture On 25 October 1806 Lieutenant John Foote and Hannah were covering the passage of a convoy through the Straits of Gibraltar. Hannahs crew consisted of 27 men from Queen and . They were off Cabrita point when Foote sighted a Spanish mistico towing an English merchantman that she had captured. Foote sailed towards the two, intending to attempt to recover the captured vessel. As Hannah approached the mistico cast off the tow and altered course towards Hannah. Foote, realizing that the mistico was larger than Hannah, attempted to escape, but the mistico soon overtook her and opened fire. Foote realized that the only hope was to carry the mistico by boarding. He ran Hannah alongside the mistico. However, a large number of Spaniards leapt aboard Hannah. Some ten or so minutes of hand-to- hand combat ensued before Foote decided to strike. He stated that he struck to spare his men's lives when he \\"saw scarce an Englishman standing, and another Privateer coming up close\\". The British had suffered seven men killed (two of whom had drowned), and 12 wounded (including Foote), one of whom died later. The Spanish had three men seriously wounded.El apresamiento del bergantín HMS Hannah.
