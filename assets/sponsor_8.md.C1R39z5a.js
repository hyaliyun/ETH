In 1928, he graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts as an architect. Between 1930 and 1932, he worked as the control architect of many buildings including Bursa Cinema Theater in Bursa, which is among the first modern cinema, theater and concert halls of the republic history. The winning of a cinema and office building project competition in El√¢zƒ±ƒü is one of the important achievements in his professional life. However, the most important turning point in his career was the fact that he won the competition for the Ankara exhibition building in 1933. The building, which was built in 1933-1934, was a successful practice in Soviet Structuralism or Neo-Plasticism styles. The building, which often hosts exhibitions reflecting the development moves of the republic, was used as a work symbolizing the ideals of Kemalist thought in photographs, postcards and republic posters, and most often in the pages of La Turquie Kemaliste. The exhibition building was converted into an opera house in 1948 by Paul Bonatz. It is said that the transformation of the structure from its original form into an appropriate form for the style of Second National Architecture with its porticoes and ornaments distressed ≈ûevki Balmumcu and removed him from the architectural profession. The architect did not go to Ankara after this incident. After his success in 1933, ≈ûevki Balmumcu won many architectural design competitions. From 1941 to 1958 he worked in Tekel General Directorate as a construction bureau chief. After 1958, he continued his professional life independently, but there was no remarkable work during this period. He died on April 20, 1982. His funeral was buried in Edirnekapƒ± Cemetery.

He wrote about thirty books about life, death, and the hereafter. Rulof claimed to be the greatest medium ever, and that nobody would ever surpass him. The next great medium would be the \\"Direct Voice Apparatus\\" (DVA), a technical device that would enable people to communicate directly with the spirit world. The DVA would be based on another device to make all diseases disappear.De Volkeren der Aarde, p. 360 He claimed he was under the control of two guides: master Alcar and master Zelanus. Tenets of his teachings There is no death The most important point in the teachings of Jozef Rulof is that there is no death. A human dies when the silver cord, which connects the physical body with the spiritual body, breaks. The spirit then leaves its body and goes back to the world of the unconscious awaiting a new birth, or it goes to a sphere of darkness or a sphere of light, depending on the spiritual attunement of that person. Suicide Rulof believed that each human has a certain time to live. When someone commits suicide, they only lose day- consciousness. The silver cord does not break and the suicide remains in the material body. They then experience the body's rotting. According to Rulof, this pain cannot be compared with any torture on earth. When the body is rotted completely and the skeleton becomes visible, the person walks in an empty world and only sees and hears themselves. When the actual time of death has come, the spirit goes back to the world of the unconscious, or it goes to one of the spheres. For example, when someone commits suicide at the age of 35, and that person had to become 85 years old, they must dwell in an empty world for 50 years. The book The Cycle of the Soul tells the story of Lantos and what he experiences when he commits suicide. Cremation Jozef Rulof rejects cremation.Jeus van Moeder Crisje, p. 255 It would cause a shock and an unbearable suffering for the dead. Persons attuned to a sphere of light will not suffer much, but persons attuned to a sphere of darkness will burn spiritually. Persons going back to the world of the unconscious awaiting a new birth will not feel anything. In the book A View into the Hereafter, there is a story about someone who committed suicide and what he experiences when he is being cremated. Karma and 'Cause and Effect' A person creates karma when someone commits murder. In a next life, the murderer is born as a woman and gives birth to the one who was murdered. This way, the murderer gets a chance to make it up. Cause and Effect means what you do to another, you do to yourself. According to Rulof, this Cause and Effect can be seen primarily in marriage. One could say that if the man wears the pants, the woman has to make good to him and if the woman wears the pants, the man has to make good to her. Body, spirit and soul The human spirit consists of a tenuous, spiritual substance and looks the same as the physical body. The soul is a piece of pure All-Source, a propelling force which forces man to evolution. The spirit is connected with the physical body by means of a silver cord, which works like a rubber band. Thoughts are sent via this cord through the solar plexus to the brain, where they are intercepted and analyzed further. The brain acts only as some kind of resistor, not as a memory. Twin souls A twin soul is what is called the One True Love. Every person has a twin soul, because the All- Source represents fatherhood as well as motherhood. Man and woman form one unity. Our twin soul is the cell with which we had sexual intercourse for the first time on the Moon. Two cells united and secreted another cell. This cell divided to form two other cells. These two new cells will unite just as the parent cells did. The chance a person marries his twin soul is very small: we are already too long on Earth because of our karma and Cause and Effect. But we have certainly met our twin soul in previous lives and it is nonetheless possible that we meet our twin soul during our current life, even without knowing it. They could be our son or daughter, a friend, or awaiting a new birth in the world of the unconscious. Theory of evolution Man did not descend from ape but ape descended from man. The first living cells on Earth were human cells. When these cells died, new life emerged from their rot: animal cells. This process repeated over and over again: new cells emerged from the rot of these animal cells and so forth. Through evolution, man has indeed been a fishlike and apelike being, but never an animal apelike being. Man has always been ahead of animals and plants in terms of evolution. Astrology Astrology will never become a science.Vraag en Antwoord Deel I, p. 80 Planets can have an influence on the physical body but they cannot influence someone's personality. Cosmic Grades There are seven Cosmic Grades. The Moon is the first Cosmic Grade, Mars the second and the Earth the third. The fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh Cosmic Grades all lie in their own universe and consist of seven planets and seven suns. There are 15 planets in our universe which contain human life. We started our divine cycle on the Moon and, via six other planets, arrived on Mars. Then again, via six other planets, we finally arrived on Earth. Each of these planets pushed the development of the human body a bit further. For example, on the Moon, we reached only a fishlike phase but on Mars, we were already like an ape. This means that there are no other planets in our universe which contain human life which is as developed as on Earth. When our earthly cycle has come to an end, we go further as a spirit in the spheres. When we have fully taken possession of the seventh sphere of light, we are attracted by the Mental Areas and will soon begin our life on the first planet of the fourth Cosmic Grade. When we have taken full possession of the seventh planet of the seventh Cosmic Grade, we are in The All and our divine cycle has come to an end. Jesus Christ * Jesus was not born by a miracle of the Holy Spirit, he was born just like everybody else. * Jesus was not betrayed by Judas Iscariot. Judas hoped that his master would show his divine powers. He was surprised that Jesus did not do anything when he was arrested. Because he saw that he had made a mistake, he committed suicide.De Volkeren der Aarde, p. 171 * Jesus did not die for our sins, he was simply murdered. * Jesus was the first person who reached The All. Cosmic Art Jozef Rulof made several hundred paintings. All of his paintings have a symbolic, spiritual meaning. His primary subjects were spiritual flowers and spirits. He never painted earthly things like cows and houses. He painted on canvas, wood and plates. In the years 1947 and 1948, he gave public painting demonstrations in the Palace theater in Rotterdam and the building Diligentia in The Hague.The Painting Mediumship of Jozef Rulof During a trip to the United States, Rulof gave a remarkable painting demonstration. He made a large painting on the wall of the dining room of the rocking steamship Veendam while standing on a chair. The painting was finished in less than an hour-and-a-half.The Painting Mediumship of Jozef Rulof During another public demonstration, he amazed the audience by suddenly turning the half- finished painting upside down and continuing his work.The Painting Mediumship of Jozef Rulof One of his paintings, donated by some Dutch to thank Sweden for its help at the end of the Second World War, hung for a while in the Swedish Parliament.The Painting Mediumship of Jozef Rulof Public Speakings Jozef Rulof gave hundreds of lectures. He also held contact evenings during which the audience could ask questions about his books and related subjects, such as abortion, Adolf Hitler, astrology, the appendix, blindness, blood transfusion, capital punishment, cause and effect, cremation, euthanasia, free will, homosexuality, karma, marriage, miscarriages, mongolism, overpopulation, psychopathy, space travel, suicide, the tonsils, transsexuality, Tutankhamun, UFOs, vegetarianism, vivisection and the Second World War. During most of his lectures and during several contact evenings, Rulof was purportedly taken over by master Alcar or master Zelanus. It is a fact that there was a notable difference in tone between the lectures and contact evenings given by himself and those given by his masters. The last 57 of these lectures and some contact evenings were recorded on a wire recorder and are available in book form. Controversies and Criticism Racism In his book The Origin of the Universe, Rulof wrote that there are seven physical grades of life on Earth and that we start our earthly cycle as a jungle inhabitant and gradually evolve, through many, many lives, to the white race. Some people accuse Rulof of racism because of this theory. Discussie met rulofianen zinloos ‚Äî SKEPP They think that Rulof claimed that the white race is superior to the other races. This reasoning is, however, disputed on the following basis: * Throughout his books, he never calls for the discrimination of black people. * \\"White race\\" doesn't refer to the color of the skin. Africans, Chinese and Indians also belong to the white race or sixth and seventh degree. * Because of his theory, we all have to go through all degrees/races. This makes it rather difficult to discriminate against another. The Centre for equal opportunities and opposition to racism in Belgium even went to court to try to forbid the publication of Rulof's books. However, in 2007, the court of Dendermonde (Belgium) judged that the books of Rulof do not encourage race discrimination.De Morgen: Home Going to the Moon Rulof claimed that it is impossible to go to the Moon with a rocket because of unknown forces in the universe. In his book The Origin of the Universe, he stated that the rocket would \\"melt apart\\". In Questions and Answers, Part V, he wrote that it is wrong to think that the rocket would be attracted by the Moon: the planet would push the rocket away in the first place. According to him, it would be possible to go far away from the Earth, but when one goes too far, one has to accept his death. Trivia * The Society Spiritual-Science Foundation The Age of Christ administers the complete works of Jozef Rulof. It was set up for this purpose in 1946 by Rulof himself. * In 1952, a few months before his death, Rulof published a series of articles in the magazine Heemsteedse Nieuwsblad, which would later become the Europese Heraut under the pseudonym Marja Radjany.

In 1984, they hired Bob Gaskins, a former Ph.D. student at the University of California, Berkeley, in exchange for a large percentage of the company's stock. He and software developer Dennis Austin and a small team that included Ramesh G led the development of a program called Presenter, which they later renamed PowerPoint.Absolute Powerpoint Also in 1984, Forethought acquired the rights to publish a Macintosh version of a DOS-based application called Nutshell. They named the Mac version FileMaker and it soon became enormously successful. PowerPoint 1.0 was released in 1987 for the Apple Macintosh. It ran in black and white, generating text-and-graphics pages for overhead transparencies. A new full-color version of PowerPoint shipped a year later after the first color Macintosh came to market. Later in 1987, Forethought and PowerPoint were purchased by Microsoft Corporation for $14 million. In May 1990 the first Windows 3.0 versions were produced. Since 1990, PowerPoint has been a standard part of the Microsoft Office suite of applications except for the Basic Edition. Microsoft PowerPoint would go on to become the most used and sought after presentation suite, having a 95% market share.

Examples of the sidebar can be seen in the Opera web browser, Apache OpenOffice, LibreOffice, SoftMaker Presentations and File Explorer; in each case, the app exposes various functionalities via the sidebar.  Overview  Sidebars have originated in desktop apps, which are designed for rectangular screens with longer horizontal sides. Like toolbars and status bars, sidebars host both information and GUI widgets with which the user issues commands to the app. Unlike toolbars and status bars, sidebars have larger surface areas because of horizontally longer layout of desktop apps. Sidebars may use accordions to organize widgets and accommodate a larger layout than the visible surface area. Widgets In a number of Widget engines, one is able to install applets which can reside on a sidebar. Notable examples include: * Windows Sidebar, part of Windows Vista only * Google Desktop Drawers A screenshot of HandBrake depicting a drawer opened on the right Early versions of Mac OS X's Aqua UI supported a sidebar concept called drawers, which pop outside the application window frame rather than expand from the inside like most application sidebars, are used. Despite criticism, third-party applications like Transmit, OmniWeb, Shiira and BBEdit quickly adopted drawers. The standard email client, Mail, used drawers for listing mailboxes prior to 10.4 (\\"Tiger\\"), when they were replaced by a traditional sidebar. A number of other Apple-created applications and third-party applications have replaced drawers with a sidebar, or re-designed the interface to make a sidebar/drawer unnecessary. Apple's Human Interface Guidelines now recommend against their use. Formerly drawer-heavy apps, like iCal and Adium, now contain no drawers at all, and instead display an optional sidebar within the main window.

It is a part of Our Lady of the Atonement Catholic parish (the founding parish for the Anglican Use liturgy within the Roman rite of the Catholic Church) and was opened on August 15, 1994. The college preparatory school curriculum was inaugurated in 2004, the first seniors graduating in 2008. The Atonement Academy is designated as a ‚ÄúBlue Ribbon School of Excellence‚Äù by the Department of Education. The school seal is the pelican. The student population for the 2011-2012 school year totaled approximately 550 students. The Academy is accredited by the Texas Catholic Conference Accreditation Commission (TCCAC), the accrediting authority for all Catholic schools in the State of Texas, and has been awarded the Catholic High School National Honor Roll Award. The Church and School Building The sanctuary is of the traditional style with a central nave leading to an East-facing altar. It is decorated with many meaningful symbols of the Catholic faith, especially the fish net-like matrix that covers the entire ceiling, which symbolizes the Christian church's role in evangelization. The school building abuts the church and is centered around the library. The gymnasium completes the structure on the opposite side of the school building from the church. The exterior walls of the complex are styled to resemble a medieval castle. The combination of the gym, school, and church into what is essentially one large building symbolizes the Catholic understanding of the human person as one unified entity, body, mind, and spirit. Educational Philosophy and Catholic Nature of the School The educational philosophy of the Atonement Academy is summed up by the Latin phrase \\"Fides et Ratio\\" (faith and reason) and the curriculum is designed in the mold of classical and Catholic education. Classical education begins with the goal of nurturing independent lifelong learners. It focuses on independent learning skills and independent critical thinking skills necessary to encourage and foster in the student a mature desire to learn, to explore, and to seek answers independent of the instructor. The Atonement Academy curriculum is designed to encourage the rise of literate, wise and moral contributors for society by integrating the classical educational approach with a constant awareness of our culture of Western Christianity and with the magisterial teachings of the Catholic faith. It is not necessary to be Catholic to attend the Academy, however all students take theology/religion classes, all attend and participate in daily Mass, and all participate in prayers throughout the school day. On Fridays, the settings of the Novus Ordo Mass are chanted in Latin. Many of the teachers are also parishioners. The Second Vatican Council confirms the importance of the Catholic school in its Declaration on Christian Education (Gravissimum educationis) when it declares: \\"Among the various organs of education the school is of outstanding importance. In nurturing the intellectual faculties, which is its special mission, it develops a capacity for sound judgment and introduces the pupils to the cultural heritage bequeathed to them by former generations. It fosters a sense of values and prepares them for professional life. By providing for friendly contacts between pupils of different characters and backgrounds, it encourages mutual understanding. Furthermore, it constitutes a center in whose activity and growth not only the families and teachers, but also the various associations for the promotion of cultural, civil and religious life, civic society, and the entire community should take part.\\" (Gravissimum educationis, 5). Curriculum The minimum requirements for high school graduation are established by the Texas Catholic Conference Education Department. A college prep diploma in the Catholic schools of Texas requires three years of a foreign language, and all three years must be in the same language. Additionally, beginning in the 2010-2011 school year, a \\"four by four\\" policy has been implemented, mandating four years of math and science at the high school level. The Atonement Academy offers a wide variety of classes including grammar and literature, all of the sciences, Texas, U.S., and World history, U.S. government, and economics. AP courses are available to the juniors and seniors in areas such as American Literature, World Literature, American Government, American History, World History, Statistics, and Calculus. For the languages, Latin is offered in the elementary, middle and high school grades. Students at all levels participate in the Advanced Reading (AR) program. Classes are single-gender from grades 3-8. There is a quarterly awards ceremony in which the students are recognized for their academic excellence. Many of the teachers hold advanced degrees in their specialties. In the College Preparatory School (grades 9-12), the typical basic yearly course load is 7¬º credits. In addition to the 7¬º credit basic load, a few additional requirements must be met, either by having completed them in middle school, by taking them during the elective period or, in the case of Physical Education, by participating in extracurricular sports. High school-level courses completed by some students in middle school include Health, Physical Education, Technology Applications, Latin I, and Algebra I. Fine Arts The music program is centered on choral instruction, where the various student choirs play a part in the liturgy of the Mass. There are several choral concerts throughout the year as well as a series of sacred music performances. Many of the Academy's students also participate in extracurricular arts activities such as theater performances. Starting in 2014 and in keeping with the classical curriculum, classes in the History of Art in Western civilization are taken only by upper scholars. Athletics, Extracurricular Activities, and Events Sports teams include boys' varsity basketball, track and cross country, baseball, six-man football, and golf, girls' varsity basketball, volleyball, track, and cross-country. School colors are black and red, and the school team name is the Crusaders. A playing field adjacent to the church parking lot is designed to accommodate both football and baseball. Other, non-academic activities that are supported include Scouting (both boys and girls), debate club, chess club, engineering club, video club, National Honor Society, Junior Classical League, and Student Council. Yearly events include the Upper School Tea, the King's Fair (a medieval fair), the Stampede dinner (a Western-themed event), and the student- produced film festival. Every other year (including 2013), the students of the Academy have an opportunity to go on a parish-wide pilgrimage to Rome, and attend Mass in some of the greatest churches in Christendom. On the off years, the students tour Washington D.C., taking in several historical sites as well as the National Basilica of the Immaculate Conception. Uniform Requirements and Comportment Guidelines Students at The Atonement Academy are required to wear an academic uniform as well as a standardized physical education uniform. The high school uniforms in particular are noteworthy for their elegance, maturity, and strict modesty, and in the junior and senior years include the class ring. The class ring is a signet ring featuring the school's crest and is given to juniors in a special ceremony during Mass. The class ring then becomes a part of the student's official uniform. Counseling Services The students have access to a number of extracurricular counseling services. For the upper grades a full range of college counseling services are offered, with information available for a wide range of Catholic, private, and state institutions. The school has both boys and girls academic counselors in grades 6-12. Pastoral care is always available with the ordained clergy, who maintain a regular presence in the school. Confessions are available regularly by appointment.

Biography  De Refuge was born into a family of Breton origin that asserted a noble ancestry reaching back to the 14th century. His father was a member of both the Parlement of Brittany and the Parlement of Paris, and his mother and stepmother were both daughters of members of the Parlement of Paris.Poncet, Olivier (1998). Pomponne de Belli√®vre (1529-1607): Un Homme d‚Äô√âtat au Temps des Guerres de Religion. Paris : √âcole des Chartes. . He studied law at Bourges and graduated in 1586. In 1592 he acquired a position as a Conseiller of the Parlement of Paris as part of the loyalist majority in Tours. In 1595, de Refuge married Hel√®ne de Belli√®vre, the widowed daughter of Pomponne de Belli√®vre, a retired diplomat and administrator who had served as the king‚Äôs representative in Lyon. De Belli√®vre was called out of retirement to serve as the Chancellor of France for Henri IV in 1599, a position that he held until his death in 1607. His patronage was therefore of great value to Eustache de Refuge during his career, particularly during his years in Lyon. In 1597, de Refuge was dispatched by de Belli√®vre for two years to report on financial irregularities in Montpellier. On his return, he was sent to Guyenne to see to the implementation of the Edict of Nantes. He was also sent on the king‚Äôs business to Lyonnais, Dauphin√© and Provence. In 1599 he lost out in a competition to become Lieutenant General of Toulouse to a young man \\"who had the great merit of contributing 7000-8000 √©cus\\" to secure it. In 1600, however, he was promoted to Ma√Ætre des requ√™tes: an acknowledged stepping- stone to career advancement in the administrative hierarchy. In 1601 he was again promoted, this time to Intendant at Lyon. His mandate focused primarily on improving local finances, maintaining law and order in the region, and seeing to the application of the Treaty of Lyon between France and Savoy.Antoine P√©ricaid, A√Øn√©. Notes et documents pour servir l'histoire de Lyon sous le R√®gne d'Henri IV 1594-1610.(1845). Lyon: Imprimerie de Mougin- Rusand, Halles de la Grenette. De Refuge remained in his position at Lyon until 1607, when he was appointed French ambassador to the thirteen cantons of Switzerland at Solothurn, where he was required to renegotiate the alliance with the cantons, including the provision of mercenary troops for the anticipated war with the House of Austria. De Refuge held this position until 1611, when he was appointed Counsellor of State and dispatched as ambassador to Holland (1611‚Äì1613), to Flanders, and back to Holland in 1614. He was then appointed Intendant in the army of the Marshal of Boisdauphin (1615), and in 1616 was made Intendant charged with setting up a Parlement in B√©arn. He lived to see the early career of Armand du Plessis, later Cardinal Richelieu, and died in 1617.  Works  Traict√© de la cour, ou instruction des courtisans (1616) A popular work in the courtly literature tradition of The Prince and The Courtier, the Treatise on the Court, or Instruction of Courtiers was first published anonymously in Holland in 1616. It consists of two books, the first of which is traditional and general in nature. De Refuge is best known, however, for the second book of the Treatise, which is an instruction manual for success at court. It is an early example of a complete work on organizational behaviour, with advice that is still taken to be as generally relevant today. It plots every step in a career, and elaborates on how to respond to many specific circumstances. Extracts from the Treatise on the Court:Refuge, Eustache de (2008).

It is the most distinguished part of the Hellenic Police. It was formed in 1978 when two counter-terrorist units were created within the two police divisions that existed then (Hellenic Gendarmerie and the Cities Police), which were united into a single body in 1984, the Hellenic Police. In the beginning the Unit had only 150 men, but when Greece became the host country of the 2004 Summer Olympics their number increased to 200 after reassessing the needs for the magnitude of the event.  Training  The EKAM force is based in Athens, but have several detachments spread throughout Greece's major cities. Each officer is a full-time member who must have at least five years on the force before being allowed to try out. Many receive training from the Greek Army's Ranger School before going on to the police counter-terrorism school.::Rieas:: - Greek Special Forces Outlook The Special Suppressive Antiterrorist Unit of the Hellenic Police follows a three-month training program every year. For its training modern, purpose-built facilities are being used. Training can also take place in other locations such as buildings in urban or rural areas (inhabited or not), the Athens International Airport, planes of Olympic Airways, the Piraeus port infrastructure, the Hellenic Railroad system, the Athens Metro. Other places that have been decided as suitable to cover its training needs can also be used. The Unit is in constant cooperation with other Special Units abroad such as the FBI, SAS and ERU via the ATLAS Network.  Operations  The Special Suppressive Antiterrorist Unit of the Hellenic Police, operates all around Greece and abroad whenever is deemed necessary. It has confronted challenges such as hostage situations and it has contributed in the arrests of many dangerous criminals. The EKAM played a key role in the dismantling of the November 17 and Revolutionary People's Struggle terrorist organizations. In March 2003, it confronted successfully an incident on a Turkish Aeroplane which was hijacked while it flew from Istanbul to Ankara (flight no. 160) and ended up at the Athens International Airport at the order of the hijacker. In a successful operation the Unit stormed the plane and arrested the hijacker by incapacitating him with a taser and releasing all hostages safely.

The pigment is a greenish derivative of hemoglobin which cannot be converted back to normal, functional hemoglobin. It causes cyanosis even at low blood levels. It is a rare blood condition in which the hemoglobin molecule has the ability to bind irreversibly to any substance containing a sulfur atom. When hydrogen sulfide (H2S) (or sulfide ions) and ferric ions combine in the blood, the blood is incapable of carrying oxygen. Presentation Symptoms include a blueish or greenish coloration of the blood, skin, and mucous membranes, even though a blood count test may not show any abnormalities in the blood. This discoloration is called cyanosis, and is caused by greater than 5 grams per cent of deoxyhemoglobin, or 1.5 grams per cent of methemoglobin, or 0.5 grams per cent of sulfhemoglobin, all serious medical abnormalities. Causes This can be caused by taking medications that contain sulfonamides under certain conditions (i.e., overdosing of sumatriptan).Sulfhemoglobinemia is usually drug induced. Drugs associated with sulfhemoglobinemia include sulphonamides such as sulfasalazine. Another possible cause is occupational exposure to sulfur compounds. It can be caused by phenazopyridine. Treatment The condition generally resolves itself with erythrocyte (red blood cell) turnover, although blood transfusions can be necessary in extreme cases. Notable cases On June 8, 2007, Canadian anesthesiologists Dr. Stephan Schwarz, Dr. Giuseppe Del Vicario, and Dr. Alana Flexman presented an unusual case in The Lancet. A 42-year-old male patient was brought into Vancouver's St. Paul's Hospital after falling asleep in a kneeling position, which caused compartment syndrome and a buildup of pressure in his legs. When doctors drew the man's blood prior to performing the surgery to relieve the pressure from the man's legs, they noted his blood was green. A sample of the blood was immediately sent to a lab. In this case, sulfhemoglobinemia was possibly caused by the patient taking higher-than- prescribed doses of sumatriptan.\\"Patient bleeds dark green blood\\", BBC News, 8 June 2007\\"Dark Green Blood In The Operating Theatre\\", Medical News Today, June 8, 2007 References  External links  *Cancer Web Project Online Medical Dictionary Category:Red blood cell disorders ","title":"Sulfhemoglobinemia"},{"id":"11667297","text":"Demas Nwoko (born 1935) is a Nigerian artist, protean designer, architect and master builder. As an artist, he strives to incorporate modern techniques in architecture and stage design to enunciate African subject matter in most of his works. In the 1960s, he was a member of the Mbari club of Ibadan, a committee of burgeoning Nigerian and foreign artists. He was also a lecturer at the University of Ibadan. In the 1970s, he was the publisher of the now defunct New Culture magazine.Dele Jegede, \\"Nwoko, Demas N.\\", Grove Art Online. Oxford University Press, accessed on 8 June 2007. Nwoko, sees design as an ingenuous activity that carries with it a focus on social responsibility for positive influences in the environment and culture of the society.\\"Makes a Case for Critical Design\\", This Day, Nigeria, 24 December 2001. Biography Early life Nwoko was born in 1935 in Idumuje Ugboko, a town that now has as its Obi (King) Nwoko's nephew (Chukwunomso Nwoko). Nwoko grew up in Idumuje Ugboko appreciating the newly constructed architectural edifices in the town and in the palace of the Obi, his father.Japhat Alakam, \\"Another Master Stroke: Demas Nwoko at Grillo‚Äôs Pavillion\\", Vanguard, 1 May 2011. He went to study fine arts at the College of Arts, Science and Technology, in 1956, a year after the college was moved from its original location in Ibadan to Zaria. In 1962, he received a scholarship from the Congress of Cultural Freedom to study at the Centre Fran√ßais du Th√©√¢tre in Paris where he learned scenic design.Daniel Meyer-Dinkgr√§fe; Who's Who in Contemporary World Theater, Routledge, 2002, p. 222. Zaria art school From 1957 to 1961 he studied Fine Arts at the former College of Arts, Science and Technology, Zaria (now Ahmadu Bello University), where he was exposed to conventional Western techniques in art, though like most of the artists at the school their subject matter was predominantly African.Robert W. July, An African Voice: The Role of the Humanities in African Independence, Duke University Press. 1987, p. 51. In the late 1950s, together with Uche Okeke, Simon Okeke, Bruce Onobrakpeya and few other art students, he formed the Art Society. This was during a period dominated by nationalistic fervour, with the attainment of national political independence in 1960. The Art Society became known for championing Natural Synthesis, a term coined by Uche Okeke to describe the combination of contemporary Western art techniques and African ideas, art forms, and themes. Pan-Africanism and early artwork In the 1950s, Nigeria's campaign for self-rule was dominated by two major ideas on how to achieve a truly independent and stable polity. One was based on regions as the foundation of the nation-state and politicians used the regions as a stepping stone for political success, the other embraced the ideas that emanated from the early Nigerian Youth Movement and the Zikist Movements to employ themes of Pan- Africanism and to forgo the regions as the foundation of the future Nigerian polity. In his art work, Nwoko moved slightly towards the latter. Nwoko's early sculpture and painting style were inspired by the findings at Nok. A lot of his early sculptures and paintings can be described as one of extrapolation. His terracotta's were designs that extended and expressed the art forms of the Ancient Nok with less deviation from an ancient African theme. This allowed the work to express less ambiguity and more clarity of intentions and to showcase a modern African art form. Architectural design After completing his studies at Zaria and Paris, he moved to Ibadan in 1963. In Ibadan, he originally concentrated on designs for theatrical productions of the University of Ibadan's department of Drama while he was also a lecturer at the university. While in the ancient city, he was sometimes short on cash and expenses to build or buy a house and studio for his work. He then decided to build his studio and house from traditional methods to complement his cash shortage. He used clay and laterite found around the site chosen and built a brick house and studio from the natural resources lying around.July (1987), p. 239. His inventiveness in using modern and new techniques for selected and protean African art works led to his name being spread around town and in the country. Nwoko's first major architectural design was for a Dominican mission in Ibadan. After the nation's independence, some missions desired to decorate their churches with African motifs. He was originally approached to design a plaque for a new chapel but he later asked the Dominican fathers to help in designing a new chapel to be located in Ibadan. Although, his initial design was a little bit crude with the utilisation of free-hand drawing, it was meant to accommodate local exigencies such as the sunny atmosphere in Ibadan. Usually, his designs were designed to have interior temperatures to be in contrast to the exterior temperatures at most times. His style was moulded to fit into the temporal needs of African citizens in a given location. Nwoko later went on to design more structures such as the Benin theatre, which used Greek and the Japanese Kabuki designs. He also designed the scepter for his brother's coronation as the Obi of Idumoje Ugboko. Other famous architectural works includes the cultural center, Ibadan, which made use of natural forms to emphasise its relationship with nature and ancient Yoruba art. Nwoko's works fuse modern techniques in architecture and stage design with African tradition. With works such as The Dominican Institute, Ibadan and The Akenzua Cultural Center, Benin, to his credit, Nwoko is one \\"artist-architect\\" who believes in celebrating the African tradition in his works. In 2007, Farafina Books published The Architecture of Demas Nwoko, a study of Nwoko's work and theories written by two British architects, John Godwin OBE and Gillian Hopwood. Reviewing the book, African Book Publishing Record states: > The Dominican Institute was his first major architectural project. He asked > the Dominicans if he could assist them in their new building. The Dominican > fathers, were eager to incorporate African motifs in their new buildings in > Ibadan. Nwoko's designs perfectly fit their needs. Nwoko's studies in Zaria > and Paris had prepared him well for his plan of combining African art with > modern ideas of European art. He began designing for University of Ibadan > theatrical productions. It was his new ideas, which led to his work with the > Dominicans and that success led to his subsequent works throughout Nigeria, > including the Oba Akenzua Theater in Benin City, Nigeria. The Oba Akenzua > Theater uses Japanese and Greek designs in an African setting. He also > designed the cultural centre in Ibadan and a sceptre his brother's > coronation.

Nwoko belongs to that generation of artists, along with Chinua > Achebe and Wole Soyinka, who fought for Nigerian independence artistically > as well as politically. This book has been produced to an exceptionally high > quality, with plentiful photographs. The Architecture of Demas Nwoko is > recommended for all architecture and African Studies collections. Stage design The success of Amos Tutuola's Palmwine Drinkard owes a little bit of credit to the effort of Nwoko. His inventive creations helped organise the choreography and direction of the play and brought to life the themes of Tutuola in every act of the play.Robert William. An African Voice ‚Äì Pa: The Role of the Humanities in African Independence, Duke University Press, 1987, p. 67. . His body of stage design and direction, which started at Ibadan includes Wole Soyinka's A Dance of the Forests, Bertholt Brecht's Der Kaukasische Kreidekreis (The Caucasian Chalk Circle), and the Mbari Theatre production of John Pepper Clark's The Masquerade.Meyer-Dinkgr√§fe.

","title":"Culture of San Antonio"},{"id":"11667310","text":"The Supreme Court of South Africa was a superior court of law in South Africa from 1910 to 1997. It was made up of various provincial and local divisions with jurisdiction over specific geographical areas, and an Appellate Division which was the highest appellate court in the country. The Supreme Court of South Africa was dissolved in 1997 when the current Constitution of South Africa came into force. The provincial and local divisions, as well as the supreme courts of the former TBVC states (\\"Bantustans\\"), became separate High Courts, while the Appellate Division became the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA). The High Courts were subsequently restructured by the Superior Courts Act, 2013 into nine provincial divisions of a single High Court of South Africa. The SCA is no longer the highest court because it is subordinate to the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court.  History  The Supreme Court was created by the South Africa Act 1909 when the Union of South Africa was formed. The Supreme Courts of the four former colonies (the Cape Colony, the Transvaal Colony, the Orange River Colony and the Natal Colony) became provincial divisions of the Supreme Court. The Court of the Eastern Districts and the High Court of Griqualand, both in the Cape, and the High Court of the Witwatersrand in the Transvaal became local divisions under their respective provincial divisions.South Africa Act, 1909, 9 Edw. VII c. 9, sec. 98. A new Appellate Division, headed by the Chief Justice of South Africa, was created to hear appeals from the provincial and local divisions. Until 1950 there was a right of appeal from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London. In 1957 the Eastern Cape Local Division was elevated to provincial status, and in 1969 the Griqualand West Local Division was similarly elevated, becoming the Northern Cape Provincial Division. Over time, two new local divisions were created: the Durban & Coast Local Division under the Natal Provincial Division, and the South Eastern Cape Local Division under the Eastern Cape Provincial Division. During the apartheid era the Supreme Court of South Africa lost jurisdiction over the quasi-independent bantustans (Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei) which created their own Supreme Courts. The Interim Constitution which came into force in 1994 kept the existing structure of the Supreme Court, but absorbed the Supreme Courts of the bantustans as provincial divisions. The final South African constitution which came into force in 1997 transformed the Appellate Division into the Supreme Court of Appeal, and the provincial and local divisions into High Courts.  Divisions  The South Africa Act created the Appellate Division, and renamed the existing courts of the colonies as follows: * The Supreme Court of the Cape of Good Hope (Cape Town) became the Cape of Good Hope Provincial Division (abbreviated CPD; now: WCC of the High Court) ** The Court of the Eastern Districts of the Cape of Good Hope (Grahamstown) became the Eastern Districts Local Division (EDL) ** The High Court of Griqualand (Kimberley) became the Griqualand West Local Division (GWL) * The Supreme Court of the Transvaal (Pretoria) became the Transvaal Provincial Division (TPD; now: GP) ** The High Court of Witwatersrand (Johannesburg) became the Witwatersrand Local Division (WLD; now: GJ) * The High Court of the Orange River Colony (Bloemfontein) became the Orange Free State Provincial Division (OPD; now: FB) * The Supreme Court of Natal (Pietermaritzburg) became the Natal Provincial Division (NPD; now: KZP) ** The Durban & Coast Circuit Court (Durban) became the Durban & Coast Local Division (DCLD; now: KZD) Subsequent changes to the divisions were as follows: * In 1957 the Eastern Districts Local Division was separated from the Cape Provincial Division and became the Eastern Cape Provincial Division (abbreviated E; now: ECG). * In 1969 the Griqualand West Local Division was separated from the Cape Provincial Division and became the Northern Cape Provincial Division (NC; now: NCK). * In 1973 a Transkeian High Court was created at Umtata, becoming the Supreme Court of the Transkei when that homeland attained nominal independence in 1976 (Tk; now: ECM). * In 1974 the South Eastern Cape Local Division was created at Port Elizabeth, having jurisdiction (concurrently with the Eastern Cape Provincial Division) over that city and the surrounding districts (SE; now: ECP). * In 1977 the Supreme Court of Bophuthatswana was created when the homeland attained nominal independence (B; now: NWM). Supreme Courts of Venda (V; now: LT) and Ciskei (Ck; now: ECB) were similarly created in 1979 and 1981 respectively.

(2005). \\"Nihon-≈ç dai ichi ran\\" in According to the 1871 edition of the American Cyclopaedia, the 1834 French translation of Nihon ≈ådai Ichiran was one of very few books about Japan available in the Western world.Ripley, George. (1871). Prepared under the patronage of the tair≈ç Sakai Tadakatsu This illustrative page from the Waseda University's copy of Nihon ≈ådai Ichiran shows part of a widely used Edo period reference book about Imperial Japanese history. The material selected for inclusion in the narrative reflects the perspective of its original Japanese author and his samurai patron, the tair≈ç Sakai Tadakatsu, who was daimy≈ç of the Obama Domain of Wakasa Province. It was the first book of its type to be brought from Japan to Europe, and was translated into French as \\"Nipon o da√Ø itsi ran\\". Dutch Orientalist and scholar Isaac Titsingh brought the seven volumes of Nihon ≈ådai Ichiran with him when he returned to Europe in 1797 after twenty years in the Far East. All these books were lost in the turmoil of the Napoleonic Wars, but Titsingh's French translation was posthumously published. The manuscript languished after Titsingh's death in 1812; but the project was revived when the Oriental Translation Fund of Great Britain and Ireland sponsored printing and publication in Paris with distribution to be handled from London. The Paris- based philologist and orientalist Julius Klaproth was engaged to shepherd the text into its final printed form in 1834, including a Suppl√©ment aux Annales des Da√Øri, which generally mirrors the pattern of Titsingh's initial Annales des empereurs du Japon; and the reach of this additional material stretches thinly through the 18th century history of Japan. First book of its type to be published in the West This became the first Japanese-authored historical account of its sort to be published and circulated for scholarly study in the West. It is fitting that this rare book was selected as one of the first to be scanned and uploaded for online study as part of an ongoing international digitization project which has now been renamed the Google Books Library Project: ::Titsingh, Isaac, ed.

Work on this volume was substantially complete in 1783 when Titsingh sent a manuscript copy to Kutsuki Masatsuna, daimyo of Tamba. Masatsuna's comments on this text were lost in a shipwreck as the edited manuscript was being forwarded from Japan to India in 1785 where Titsingh had become head of the Dutch East Indies Company trade operations at Hoogly in West Bengal. The final version of Titsingh's dedication of the book to his friend Masatsuna was drafted in 1807, a little more than a quarter-century before the book was eventually published.Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). Annales des empereurs du japon, pp. v‚Äìvi. 17th-century text in Japanese and Chinese The original multi-volume text was compiled in the early 1650s by Hayashi Gah≈ç. His father, Hayashi Razan, had developed a compelling, practical blending of Shinto and Confucian beliefs and practices. Razan's ideas lent themselves to a well-accepted program of samurai and bureaucrat educational, training and testing protocols. In 1607, Razan was accepted as a political advisor to the second sh≈çgun, Tokugawa Hidetada. Sometime thereafter, he became the rector of Edo's Confucian Academy, the Sh≈çhei-k≈ç. This institution stood at the apex of the country-wide educational and training system which was created and maintained by the Tokugawa shogunate. In the elevated context his father engendered, Gah≈ç himself was also accepted as a noteworthy scholar in that period. The Hayashi and the Sh≈çheik≈ç links to the work's circulation are part of the explanation for this work's 18th and 19th century popularity. Gah≈ç was also the author of other works designed to help readers learn from Japan's history, including the 310 volumes of The Comprehensive History of Japan (Êú¨ÊúùÈÄöÈëë/„Åª„Çì„Å°„Çá„ÅÜ„Å§„Åå„Çì,Honch≈ç-tsugan) which was published in 1670. The narrative of Nihon ≈ådai Ichiran stops around 1600, most likely in deference to the sensibilities of the Tokugawa regime. Gah≈ç's text did not continue up through his present day; but rather, he terminated the chronicles just before the last pre-Tokugawa ruler. In Keian 5, 5th month (1652), Nihon ≈ådai Ichiran was first published in Kyoto under the patronage of one of the three most powerful men in the Tokugawa bakufu, the tair≈ç Sakai Tadakatsu.In the pre-Hepburn transliteration, this patron was identified as Minamoto-no Tada katsou, Prince of Wakasa and General of the Right. Titsingh, p. 412. The original Japanese authorship is confirmed at p. 406 and; the precise neng≈ç-dating is confirmed in the same passage. In supporting this work, Sakai Todakatsu's motivations appear to spread across a range anticipated consequences; and it becomes likely that his several intentions in seeing that this specific work fell into the hands of an empathetic Western translator were similarly multi- faceted.Yamshita, S. (2001). \\"Yamasaki Ansai and Confucian School Relations, 1650-1675\\" in Early Modern Japan, pp. 3-18. Gah≈ç's book was published in the mid-17th century and it was reissued in 1803, \\"perhaps because it was a necessary reference work for officials.\\"Screech, Timon. (2006). Secret Memoirs of the Shoguns: Isaac Titsingh and Japan, 1779-1822. p. 65. Contemporary readers must have found some degree of usefulness in this chronicle; and those who ensured that this particular manuscript made its way into the hands of Isaac Titsingh must have been persuaded that something of value could become accessible for readers in the West. Post-Meiji scholars who have cited Nihon ≈ådai Ichiran as a useful source of information include, for example, Richard Ponsonby-Fane in Kyoto: the Old Capital of Japan, 794-1869.Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1956). Kyoto: the Old Capital of Japan, p. 317. The American poet Ezra Pound, writing to a contemporary Japanese poet in 1939, confirmed that his reference library included a copy of Nihon ≈ådai Ichiran. At that time, Pound explained that \\"as far as [he had] time to read\\", the work seemed a \\"mere chronicle.\\" However, modern literary critics have demonstrated by textual comparisons that Pound relied on Titsingh's French translation in crafting some sections of the Cantos.Analysis of Pound's literary and historical sources 19th century translation in French Titsingh's translation was eventually published in Paris in 1834 under the title Annales des empereurs du Japon.Pouillon, Fran√ßois. (2008). Dictionnaire des orientalistes de langue fran√ßaise, p. 542. The 1834 printing incorporates a slim \\"supplement\\" with material which post-dates Titsingh's departure from Japan in 1784. This additional section of the book was not the product of translation, but must have been informed by oral accounts or correspondence with Japanese friends or European colleagues still in Japan. Titsingh worked on this translation for years before his death; and in those final years in Paris, he shared his progress with orientalists Julius Klaproth and Jean- Pierre Abel-R√©musat, who would edit his first published posthumous book: M√©moires et anecdotes sur la dynastie r√©gnante des djogouns (Memoirs and anecdotes on the reigning dynasty of sh≈çguns). R√©musat would later become the first professor of Chinese language at the Coll√®ge de France. Titsingh's correspondence with William Marsden, a philologist colleague in the Royal Society in London, provides some insight into the translator's personal appreciation of the task at hand. In an 1809 letter, he explains: ::\\"Accompanying I offer you the three first volumes of [Nihon ≈ådai Ichiran] ... Notwithstanding the clouds of darkness [concerning] the origin of the Japanese ..., [the] progressive detail of the various occurrences spread much light on the customs still prevailing, and fully proves, they have been already a civilized and enlightened nation at the time our modern empires were either unknown, or plunged in the utmost barbarism ... We are no prophets. We cannot foretell what at a more distant period is to happen; but for the present, it is a fact [that] nobody exists in Europe but me, who can [provide] such an ample and faithful detail about a nation, quite unknown here, though fully deserving to be so in every respect.\\"Titsingh, letter to William Marsden dated 10 October 1809 in Frank Leguin, ed. (1990). Private Correspondence of Isaac Titsingh, Vol. I, p. 470, Letter No. 205 (not page number, but letter number ‚Äì pagination is continuous across the two volumes); see also An'ei for a congruent excerpt in another 1809 letter from Titsingh to Marsden. ‚Äì Isaac Titsingh Klaproth dedicated the book to George Fitz-Clarence, the Earl of Munster, who was Vice President of the Royal Asiatic Society and also a Vice Chairman and Treasurer of the Oriental Translation Fund of Great Britain and Ireland.Klaproth, Julius. (1834) Annales des empereurs du japon, dedication page. The fund had sponsored Klaproth's work and was the principal underwriter of the publication costs Critical analysis Japanologist John Whitney Hall, in his Harvard-Yenching monograph on Tanuma Okitsugu assessed the utility of this translation and its context: ::These few examples of the outstanding contacts which Titsingh records suffice to give us an idea of the intimate associations which the Japanese had established with the Dutch at this time, associations from which the Dutch were also to gain a great deal. Titsingh's Illustrations of Japan shows the result of careful translation from Japanese sources, as does also the posthumous Annales des Empereurs du Japon, which is a translation of the ≈ådai-ichiran. Titsingh's ability to take away without molestation numerous books on Japan as well as maps and drawings of the Japanese islands illustrates the liberal state of affairs at Nagasaki.Hall, John Whitney. (1955). Tanuma Okitsugu, 1719-1788, pp. 94-95. Isaac Titsingh himself considered the Nihon odai ichiran fairly dry. He viewed the work of translation as \\"a most tedious task\\".

He was a second baseman for the San Diego Padres. He also played nine seasons in Japan with the Taiyo Whales and Yomiuri Giants. He is of Filipino (Ilocano) and Caucasian ancestry. Personal life John Sipin was born in Watsonville, California and is the son of Johnny Imperial Sipin, a Filipino of Ilocos origin and Ethel White, a native from Little Rock Arkansas, US. John grew up in Watsonville and went to Watsonville High School where his baseball jersey was retired in 2006. John is currently married to Gizelle Sipin (a local of Soquel, California) and together they have two daughters Alisha and Kamala. Youth career Sipin played for the men's softball team of the Ilocos Region (Region I) in the Palarong Pambansa, the national student's games of the Philippines, in the 1970s. Sipin's team dominated the games and were known as the \\"Marcos Boys\\" since the regional softball program was supported by the Marcos political family. Professional career  Saint Louis Cardinals Sipin was selected by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 55th round of the 1965 amateur draft. He played four seasons in the Cardinals' minor league system, rising as high as the Triple-A Tulsa Oilers, with whom he opened the season. He was traded to the San Diego Padres on May 22, 1969 with Sonny Ruberto for the Padres' Jerry DaVanon and Bill Davis.Baseball Reference Website San Diego Padres Following the trade, Sipin was promoted to the major leagues. Sipin played 68 games for the Padres that season, batting .223 with 12 doubles, two triples and two homers in 229 at bats. He also had 9 RBIs and 2 stolen bases that season. Sipin had 7 errors in the field, giving him a fielding percentage of 0.976 for 477 innings. An interesting quirk to Sipin's major league career was that he hit a triple in each of his first two big league at bats, but never collected another three- base hit in the majors. On May 24, 1969, Sipin hit triples in the first and fourth innings off pitcher Ken Holtzman of the Chicago Cubs. Following the 1969 season, Sipin returned to the minor leagues. He played the next two seasons with the Padres' top farm team, for the Salt Lake City Bees and for the Hawaii Islanders. Each year, he hit over .300 with exactly 20 home runs. However, he never got another shot at the major leagues. Japanese Major League Baseball Sipin signed with the Taiyo Whales (current Yokohama BayStars) in 1972, and instantly became one of the best second basemen in Japanese baseball during the 1970s. He played his best season in 1975, hitting 34 home runs and 82 RBIs, with a .295 batting average. He also won the Japanese golden glove award, being the first foreigner to be awarded the Golden Glove, in 1972 and 1973. He was given to the Yomiuri Giants in 1978, and hit over .300 each of his full seasons with the Giants, often playing in the outfield instead of second base. He retired in 1980, after missing half of the season with an injury. Sipin gained incredible popularity in Japan, and his huge mat of hair and beard gave him the nickname, Lion Maru (after the character in the children's television series Kaiketsu Lion-Maru). He was highly entertaining on and off the field, making entrances with extravagant outfits, or fielding ground balls with his batting helmet on. He drastically changed his appearance when he joined the Yomiuri Giants, shaving off his long hair and beard to adopt a gentleman-like look (similarly, Michihiro Ogasawara shaved off his trademark beard when he joined the Giants, though this was probably more in imitation of Johnny Damon and the New York Yankees). Though Sipin changed his look when he joined the Giants, his wild personality did not change at all, especially because Clete Boyer, his coach and mentor on the Taiyo Whales, was no longer there to hold him back. In 1978, he charged at the mound after being hit by a pitch two times during the season, and was ejected both times after beating up the opposing pitcher. He had been ejected once with the Whales, but only for kicking sand onto the home plate after a disputed call. Sources *.

Central The central area of San Antonio is highly diverse economically, ethnically, and socially. While the term \\"Central San Antonio\\" is not widely used, the notion of a greater area around the downtown core exists. Neighborhoods and districts that fall within this area are not easily categorized as part of the city's north, south, east, or west sides. City Council District 1 is a slender geographic area that covers most of the city's central area, roughly bordered by I-410 to the north, I-10 to the west and south, and I-37/U.S. 281 to the east. Alamo Heights, a separate municipality located a couple of miles northeast of downtown, is an inner suburb that is often considered central. Downtown Downtown San Antonio The urban core of the city and metropolitan area, Downtown San Antonio encompasses many of the city's famous structures, attractions, and businesses. The central business district is generally understood to cover the northern half of the \\"Downtown Loop\\" -- the area bordered by Cesar Chavez to the south. Due to the sheer size of the city and its horizontal development, downtown accounts for less than one half of one percent of San Antonio's geographic area. Downtown is a popular destination for tourists. Attractions such as the Alamo, the River Walk, the Tower of the Americas, the Alamodome, St. Paul Square, the Pearl Brewery, Market Square, and the Shops at Rivercenter attract millions of visitors every year. The city hosts an annual Christmas lighting festival on the river to welcome the holidays. Midtown Neighborhoods Typical Monte Vista Historic District street sign Bounded by Hildebrand Avenue to the north, Broadway to the east, I-10 to the west and I-35 to the south, Eastside of San Antonio's Historic District features an assortment of neighborhoods ranging from the working class Beacon Hill to the up-and-coming Five Points to the established upper middle class Monte Vista. Each neighborhood has distinctive housing characteristics, from Victorian in Beacon Hill to French Eclectic, Neoclassical and Italian Renaissance in Monte Vista. Located between Alamo Heights and Downtown, and East side of San Antonio Historic District is one of the most historic areas of metro San Antonio, home to Temple Beth-El, Trinity University, and neighborhoods such as Five Points, Tobin Hill, the Monte Vista Historic District, Alta Vista, Beacon Hill, University Hill, and Trinity Heights, Brackenridge Park and the Japanese Tea Garden known as the Garden District. Tobin Hill is located on the Eastside of San Antonio bordering downtown, this area is a mix of residential, commercial, and cultural space. Olmos Park Terrace, a neighborhood that was granted historic district status by the City of San Antonio in 2007, lies just north of Hildebrand next to the City of Olmos Park. It borders the districts of Eastside of SA, and Downtown. Southtown Guenther and Sons Flour Mill, Southtown The city's near south side is referred to as \\"Southtown.\\" Immediately south of Cesar Chavez Boulevard along South Presa/South Saint Mary's/South Alamo streets and, more recently, South Flores is a district of Downtown San Antonio known as Southtown. Southtown is next to the King William Historic District, where the writer Sandra Cisneros has a home, and the Lavaca neighborhood, as well as the warehouse and loft conversions of Blue Star Contemporary Art Center along South Flores/Probandt/Cevallos streets. Once labeled Texas' most eccentric neighborhood by Texas Monthly magazine, Southtown is known for its diverse community, art galleries, restaurants, and Victorian era homes. There is a heavy concentration of resident artists and contemporary art spaces, such as those found on emerging South Flores. Restaurants and bars in Southtown include Bar America, Blue Star Brewing Company (adjacent to Blue Star Contemporary Art Center), Rosario's, La Tuna, El Mirador, and The Friendly Spot. Art spaces and galleries include Blue Star Contemporary Art Center, UTSA Satellite Space, San Antonio Art League, SAY Si!, Joan Grona Gallery, David Shelton Gallery, Cactus Bra Space, Three Walls Gallery, Justice Works, REM Gallery, San Angel Folk Art, Stone Metal Press, and Fiber Artspace. On the first Thursday of the month the serious area art galleries have openings. On the first Friday of every month, Blue Star essentially acts as the hub of the Downtown event known as First Friday. A diverse crowd of art lovers can visit galleries, art spaces, vintage stores, and street vendors selling art and jewelry, all while listening to live music. Second Saturday is usually on the following weekend after First Friday but sometimes falls on the very next day. Second Saturday is a monthly showcase of the area commonly known as SoFlo (a trendy abbreviation for the South Flores street where it is located) also known by its inhabitants as the South Flores Arts District. The area is only a few blocks South of the Blue Star District but is popular for those who want a less crowded environment than the one found at First Friday. Art galleries include One9Zero6, FL!GHT, LoneStar Studios, Salon Mijangos, Gallista Gallery, and Triangle Project Space. Artists in the area with studios include Andy Benavides, Justin Parr, Ed Saavedra, Zane Lewis, Thomas Cummins, and Dario Robleto.

Northeast Side The Northeast Side, a very suburban area, is home to Randolph Air Force Base, Schertz, Converse, Universal City, Selma, Kirby, Windcrest, and Live Oak. Four school districts educate this side of the city, including Judson, Schertz-Cibolo-Universal City and North East. The northeast side also houses The Forum, which is one of San Antonio's largest shopping centers consisting of a variety of shops and restaurants (located on the corner of Loop 1604 and I-35). Rolling Oaks Mall also serves this area (located on the north side of I-35 at Loop 1604 and Nacogdoches Road). Northwest Side The Northwest Side of San Antonio is home to a wide range of neighborhoods, suburbs, and businesses unique to the Alamo City. The community is the location of the main campus of the University of Texas at San Antonio, the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, and the Northwest Campus of the University of the Incarnate Word, which includes the Rosenberg School of Optometry. Also located in northwest San Antonio is the Medical Center District, which is home to the South Texas Medical Center hospital and research district.

The wealthy city of Shavano Park is also on the Northwest Side, as is Camp Bullis. West The West Side is predominantly Hispanic and working class, with pockets of wealth in the northwest and far west. Inner West Side Known for its Mexican and Tejano culture, the Inner West Side is showcased in places like the Guadalupe Street commercial and entertainment district and the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Little Flower. It is also home to the historic Our Lady of the Lake University and St. Mary's University. The Inner West Side is a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood. The Inner West Side's historic Prospect Hill neighborhood, one of the first communities to be built in this area, is rich in history and is within the city's original 36 miles. Notable Prospect Hill residents (past and present) include former San Antonio Mayor / 10th US HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros, actress Carol Burnett, and Congressman Henry B. Gonzalez. The housing is primarily modest 2- and 3-bedroom homes with a mix of early 1900s and post-WWII houses. Avenida Guadalupe is the neighborhood west of downtown across I-10 and I-35, which includes the Guadalupe Cultural Arts Center. Established in 1979, the Avenida Guadalupe Association is a 501(c)(3) that is both a Neighborhood Association and a Community Development Corporation. Vista Verde South is a small historic neighborhood located directly between Avenida Guadalupe and the highway. Within its borders are the UTSA Downtown Campus and a small residential area which was revitalized in the early 1990s. The land on which UTSA Downtown Campus is was formerly the site of the Fiesta Plaza Mall, which was a failed retail complex. Near Northwest Side The Near Northwest is home to the Deco District, Jefferson, Woodlawn Lake, Monticello Park, Inspiration Hills, Donaldson Terrace, and Hillcrest Neighborhoods. Near the center of the community is the historic Thomas Jefferson High School and Jefferson Memorial Tower at Jefferson United Methodist Church. Far West Side The Far Northwest/West Side is one of the fastest growing areas in Metropolitan San Antonio. A large part of this area is outside of the San Antonio city limits, but is served by Bexar County Government. Here you will find Sea World San Antonio, Northwest Vista College, QVC, Wells Fargo, Coventry Health Care, CitiCorp and several other large employers. The Far Northwest/West subdivisions attract many military families who relocate from all over the US due to its close proximity to Lackland AFB. With new homes starting in the low to mid 100's, the area attracts many middle-class families and first time home buyers. Major roads include Loop 1604, State Highway 151, U.S. Highway 90, and Loop 410. Due to the recent real estate boom in the area, Christus Santa Rosa Westover Hills Hospital, numerous businesses including Kohl's, HEB Plus, and Super Wal-mart have moved in as well as many restaurant chains and other specialty stores to the new districts of Westover Hills and Alamo Ranch. South South of Downtown, the South Side is characterized as a predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods, an average of 81 percent. Also on the south side of the city is Texas State Highway Loop 13 more commonly known as Military Drive. Loop 13 served as the cities primary loop before Interstate 410 was constructed. Military Drive links many of the city's military facilities on the south side such as Lackland Air Force Base, Kelly Field Annex the former Kelly Air Force Base, Stinson Municipal Airport, and Brooks City-Base formerly Brooks Air Force Base before turning into W.W. White Rd. which heads north becoming Farm to Market Road 78 leading to Randolph Air Force Base in Universal City, Texas. A huge growth in the south side came when Toyota decided to build a manufacturing plant that produces the Toyota Tundra and more recently Toyota Tacoma pick-up trucks, on the far south side near Texas State Highway 16 and Interstate 410 interchange. Most of the south side's shopping centers are located on Military Drive near major intersections. Interstate 35 & Southwest Military Drive, South Park Mall which is anchored by such stores such as Macy's, Sears, Bealls (Texas) and J. C. Penney. Along the intersection of Interstate 37 & South New Braunfels, The McCreless Market Shopping Center formally McCreless Mall which is an open-air shopping center anchored by H-E-B Plus!, Bealls (Texas), and a 16 screen Cinemark Theaters. The Southeast Military Drive and IH-37 corridor is home to City-Base Landing that has such stores as Walmart Supercenter, H-E-B, Target, and Best Buy. City-Base landing West is also the home of a brand new state of the art Mission Trail Baptist Hospital that opened in 2011, the first new hospital on the south side in nearly forty years. Another new addition is the brand new Mission Branch Library on Roosevelt Avenue near the San Jose Mission. This library was built on the site of the old Mission Drive-In which was the last drive-in theater in the city for many years. The drive-in was recently remodeled until it was vandalized and was deemed too expensive to reopen. A single theater is still preserved in its memory. The South Side is home to Palo Alto College and the newly opened Texas A&M; University-San Antonio. Before the beginning of this decade many of the city's young population would cruise \\"Military\\". Many classic cars and lowriders would drive close to the 35 intersection and muscle cars and import street racers would hang out close to the 37 intersection along the main entrance of what was once the main gate of Brooks A.F.B. The south side is predominantly Hispanic especially in its inner city neighborhoods such as Harlandale, Palm Heights, Columbia Heights, Hot Wells, Highland Hills, Indian Creek, Valley Hi, and Palo Alto. Four out of five of the city's historic missions are located on the south side along the San Antonio River besides the Alamo. They are San Jose, Concepcion, San Juan Capistrano, and San Francisco de la Espada. The River Walk is also extending into the south side and can now be seen all the way into Concepcion Park and is continuing to grow further outwards towards Military Drive. San Antonio's famous \\"Ghost Tracks\\" is located in the cities McCreless Meadows neighborhood near the intersection of Villamain Rd. and Shane. An old tale that a school bus was in an accident many years ago and a group of children were supposedly all killed. A phenomenon is supposed to happen when your vehicle is put in neutral with the ignition off, the vehicle begins to roll up hill crossing the tracks all on its own. It is said that the children's ghosts are pushing your vehicle out of the way of a passing train. Many people put talcum powder all over their vehicle and fingerprints will begin to show up after the tracks are crossed. All the streets located in the neighboring neighborhood are named after what is supposedly named after all of the children that were killed there long ago. The southern part of the city does not extend as far outward towards Texas State Highway Loop 1604 like much of the far north side does. Much of the city's far south side (outside loop 410) remains unincorporated and rural, although new neighborhoods, such as Mission del Lago, are uprising. The suburb of Elmendorf, Texas sits along the south side's two main lakes, Victor Braunig Lake and Calaveras Lake (Texas). East AT&T; Center Bordered roughly by IH-37 to the west, IH-35 to the north, IH-10 to the south, and Loop 410 to the east, the East Side is home to the San Antonio Stock Show & Rodeo, the AT&T; Center and its older neighbor, the Freeman Coliseum. Other northern cities include Windcrest, a northeastern suburb known for its extravagant Christmas light displays. The far southeastern suburb of China Grove is located along US 87 and was the subject of a Doobie Brothers song entitled China Grove. The Pecan Valley neighborhood, located west of China Grove, was the host of the 50th Anniversary of the PGA Golf Championship. The East Side most notable residents were actress Joan Crawford and congressman Percy Sutton of New York. Joan Crawford was born and raised on the infamous Cherry Street area. Soap star Al Freeman was also born and raised in San Antonio along with actress Paula Prentiss. San Antonio Historic Landmark 961 The East Side has the largest concentration of black residents. One of the newest additions to the San Antonio Historic Districts is Knob Hill thanks to the efforts of the late Dora Tovar and is located in the Southeast part of the city and a mile and a half from Alamo Plaza. It is bordered by Iowa Street to the north, Nelson Street to the south, and South Palmetto and New Braunfels Avenues to the west and east. The neighborhood is intersected by Virginia Boulevard. Knob Hill was part of the John Bowen tract purchased in 1853. The purchaser of the tract is believed to be the John Bowen, the first San Antonio postmaster and the owner of Bowen's Island (where the Tower Life Building is located downtown). The Victorian home located at 1003 South New Braunfels was built in 1897 and is immediately south of Knob Hill Addition was owned by Elizabeth Bowen Nelson, the daughter of John Bowen. The house has since been designated the Elizabeth Bowen Nelson House and is San Antonio Historic landmark #961. The tract was owned by the Bowens until H.J. Goode purchased the property around 1909. Knob Hill is primarily a residential neighborhood platted in February 1910 and is known for its overall architectural integrity. Its homes are reflective of the Classical Revival style interspersed with Folk Victorian, Bungalows, and Minimal Traditionals. It was at its prime in the early 20th century, as it was seen as an attractive and less expensive alternative to Laurel Heights and Tobin Hill. According to early real estate ads published in the San Antonio Daily Express, the owners, W.T. Goode and R.H. and Harry Traylor, spared no expense to make it an ideal place for nice homes. Knob Hill was advertised for its tremendous distant views of Mission Concepcion, San Fernando Gardens, the \\"Lady of the Lake Academy,\\" Beacon Hill, Alamo Heights, and Fort Sam Houston among others. Closer by, residents had a full vista of downtown San Antonio. Neighborhood Development Knob Hill Addition was situated between the Southern Pacific Depot and South Heights rail car lines and within a five-minute walk to two public schools on cement sidewalks and along macadamized streets. All lots in the addition were offered at $500 to $800, were fronted north and south, and included the luxury of city water and gas. The streets, lined with a six-foot easement between the sidewalks and curb, were planted with palm trees and Ligustrum japonicum. The home at 1145 Virginia currently occupied by the University of Texas San Antonio (UTSA), Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity, Omicron Tau Alumni Chapter still has two of the giant palms flanking the front entrance. Homes along these tree-lined streets were set back 25 feet from the front property line on terraced lots to ensure symmetry of the development and avoidance of dust from the streets. The original Knob Hill plat consisted of 96 lots with 24 even lots per block for a total of 4 blocks. By early 1911, 11 homes had been completed at a cost of $3,000 to $10,000 each. Major construction for the development occurred between 1910 and 1935. According to the 1915 City Directory, 27 addresses were listed including those of owners W.T. Goode and R.H. and Harry Traylor. Goode lived at 1125 Virginia Avenue and R.H. Traylor at 101 Nelson Avenue, which was replaced around 1997. Harry Traylor also resided in Knob Hill. By 1951, only six vacant lots remained. Today, there are 89 lots with 2 lots vacant. In addition to the home of the Kappa Alpha Psi chapter described above, Knob Hill is the home of the UTSA- affiliated Omega Psi Phi fraternity, Psi Alpha Chapter, which is located at 1135 Virginia Avenue. Knob Hill was approved by City Council on September 2, 2010 as San Antonio's 27th historic district. Near East Side Sports and live music fans flock to the Near East Side to visit the Alamodome. Once home to actress Joan Crawford, this part of San Antonio includes charming Saint Paul Square, Ellis Alley (one of the first African-American neighborhoods in San Antonio) The Historic up and coming neighborhoods of Dignowity Hill, Government Hill and the Knob Hill San Antonio Historic District, with its landmark Victorian homes the Elizabeth Bowen Nelson House and other Classical Revival architecture. Other neighborhoods include Denver Heights and The Historic Gardens Neighborhoods adjacent to the Alamodome The Hays Street Bridge is a land bridge that connects downtown to the Near East Side while offering walking, biking, and outdoor recreation. Other notable landmarks are the historic San Antonio Cemeteries, The Mission Revival style Southern Pacific Passenger Depot (and other landmark structures at Sunset Station) and The University of Houston's San Antonio branch of its Conrad Hilton College. The Near East Side is bordered by I-H35 and Alamo Heights to the North. I-H 37 to the west. S New Braunfels Street to the East and I-H 10 to the South. The Historic Government Hill neighborhood is located directly south of Ft Sam Houston, Development began during the construction of the Army post in 1876. It is the oldest Historic suburb of the \\"Gilded Age\\" of the city's history. The East Side is a multicultural neighborhood.. One of the most notable homes in Government Hill is the Romanesque Revival-style Lambermont (aka Terrell Castle), built in 1894. Originally the residence was owned by Edwin Holland Terrell, Ambassador and Plenipotentiary to Belgium during the presidency of Benjamin Harrison. Terrell commissioned architect Alfred Giles for its design patterned after castles in Europe. Terrell referred to is home as a \\"castle for his bride\\" and their six children. Residents of Government Hill nicknamed Lambermont as The Castle and is still referred as such to this day. The Castle was restored and now is a venue for wedding and parties. The Classical Revival-style Bullis House Inn is Texas State Historic Landmark. Built between 1906 and 1909 by noted architect Harvey Page for General John Lapham Bullis and his family. Today residence is a Bed and Breakfast and headquarters of the San Antonio International Hostel. A Historic Resources Survey of Government Hill recognized 27 percent of the properties as high priority sites, larger than is commonly found in most districts indicating a high degree of historic integrity. Government Hill is now experiencing a revitalization and renovation of the grand old homes of the 1880s. Besides its location only minutes from Downtown San Antonio, the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) and an relocation of over 12,000 service members will create a significant growth. Notable historical events have occurred in Historic Government Hill including the incarceration of the notorious Geronimo in the Fort Sam Houston Quadrangle in 1886 and the expedition led by Belgian Astronomer Jean-Charles Houzeau in 1882 to observe the transit of Venus across the face of the sun.

Turnlock fasteners are also referred to as quick- action panel fasteners.DFCI Company History Invented and patented by an American engineer of Ukrainian descent William Dzus (Volodymyr Dzhus) in the early 1930s, Dzus fasteners are also used to secure plates, doors, and panels that require frequent removal for inspection and servicing. These fasteners are notable in that they are of an \\"over-centre\\" design, requiring positive sustained torque to unfasten. Thus, any minor disturbance to the fastener (e.g. vibration) will tend to correct itself rather than proceed to further loosening as it would in threaded fasteners. Turnlock fasteners are available in several different styles and are usually referred to by the manufacturer's trade name. Some of the most common are DZUS, Camloc, and Airloc. How it works Figures 1‚Äì4: U.S. Patent 1955740, illustrating the Dzus fastener. Figures 1‚Äì4 show the original Dzus fastener holding an aircraft cowling (10) to a fuselage (11). The cowling (10) and fuselage (11) can be quickly fastened together by bringing the cowling (10) to the fuselage (11), placing the shank (13) of the button (12) into the hole in the fuselage (25). The button (12) is turned by a screwdriver in its slot (21) to a position in which the slots (16) will hold the spring (22). As button (12) turns, the walls of its spiral slots (16) act as cams, and pull the intermediate section of the spring (22) from its relaxed position up into the slot's holes (18) past the slot's projections (17). The projection (17) in the slots (16) will resist reverse rotation of the button (12) and thus prevent unintentional separation of the cowling (10) and fuselage (11) from vibration. Optionally, to prevent noise, strips of felt or rubber (26) may be between the cowling (10) and fuselage (11). To unfasten the cowling (10) from the fuselage (11) turn the button (12) one-quarter of a turn. This will disengage the button (12) from the spring (22). The holes (18) are large-enough to allow the spring (22) to clear the projection (17) either while engaging the button (12) or disengaging it. The end of the shank (13) that has the slots (16) must be well-rounded so spring (22) can easily enter its slots (16). The Dzus fastener's removable part is a button (12) that can turn if a screwdriver is placed in the slot (21) of its head (14). The button (12) is held to the cowling (10) by its head (14) and a groove (19). The groove assures that the button (12) does not fall off the cowling (10) when the cowling is unfastened. The hole (25) includes a finish or material so that the button (12) does not bind when turned. The stationary part of the Dzus fastener has a spring (22) with coils (23) riveted (24) to the fuselage (11). The part of the spring (22) between the rivets is arched. The button's shank (13) has a tubular bore (15) opposite the head (14). The shank (13) has spiral bayonet slots (16) opposite each to other to receive the spring (22) of the stationary part of the fastener. When fastened, the slots (16) provide holes (18) that surround and hold the stationary spring (22). A projection (17) in the slots (16) holds the fastener closed by pressing the head (14) against the cowling (10) toward the spring (22) fastened to the fuselage (11). One common improvement places the female parts in a small bucket to reduce entry of water. Another is to make it easier to open and close: For example, many modern Dzus fasteners use self-centering screw-drivers. Other improvements reduce the cost. For example, changing the spring so it can be secured to the female hole avoids the cost of rivets. Some manufacturers die-cast the button rather than machining it.

It was also known as the 2nd Generation Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) program. The program began with the award of reusable launch vehicle study contracts in 2000. The primary goal of this research was to increase safety and reliability and to reduce overall costs associated with building, flying and maintaining the nation's next generation of space launch vehicles. NASA anticipated that these advances would revitalize the nation's space transportation capabilities, and dramatically improve NASA's ability to conduct science and exploration missions in space.\\"The Next Generation Launch Technology Program\\" (wikisource). NASA, May 2003. This program was ended with the cancellation of the X-33 and X-34 in 2001 along with the conclusion of the X-43 program. In November 2002 it was evolved into the Orbital Space Plane Program and the Next Generation Launch Technology Program. Around 2004 NASA changed its focus to Constellation Program, as part of the Vision for Space Exploration. The Space Launch Initiative Propulsion Office, managed by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, sought to advance technologies and explore new avenues of space propulsion to develop safer, more reliable and affordable propulsion solutions. Four main engine candidates for a second generation reusable launch vehicle emerged, including two hydrogen-fueled (COBRA, RS-83, TR-106) and two kerosene-fueled (RS-84, TR-107) staged combustion cycle engines.  COBRA rocket engine  \\"Co-optimized Booster for Reusable Applications\\". Propulsion system proposed by Pratt & Whitney-Aerojet Propulsion Associates to cover a wide range of thrust. This LH2/LOX reusable rocket engine was designed in 2003 to produce 4,500 kN thrust. Proposed as a long-life, moderate-to high-thrust, reusable booster engine that incorporated a safe, low-cost, low-risk, LH2/LOX single burner, using a fuel-rich, staged combustion cycle.A Review of United States Air Force and Department of Defense Aerospace Propulsion Needs. 2006  RS-83 rocket engine  The RS-83 was a rocket engine design for a reusable LH2/LOX rocket larger and more powerful than any other. The RS-83 was developed by Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power in Canoga Park, California to power the launch vehicle as part of the Space Launch Initiative program. This engine was designed to produce a thrust of at sea level and in a vacuum with an Isp of 395 and 446 seconds (3.87 and 4.37 kN¬∑s/kg), respectively. The RS-83 is loosely based on the RS-68 that powers the Delta IV expendable launch vehicle. The RS-83 design is more efficient, lighter, slightly stronger, and yet reusable. The RS-83 was designed to last 100 missions, and was intended for use on the first stage of a two-stage-to- orbit reusable launch vehicle.  RS-84 rocket engine  RS-84 As part of the Space Launch Initiative, Rocketdyne developed a plan for the RS-84 rocket engine. It would have been the first reusable, staged combustion cycle, liquid rocket engine produced by the US to use a hydrocarbon fuel. In contrast, the Soviet Union developed the RD-170 reusable staged combustion hydrocarbon engine for the Energia rocket in the 1980s. The prototype engine would have at sea level; in vacuum; an 8-shift turn time; a specific impulse of 305 at sea level and 324 in vacuum. NASA cancelled further development in 2005.  TR-106 / TR-107 rocket engines  The TR-106 or Low Cost Pintle Engine (LCPE) was a developmental LH2/LOX rocket engine designed by TRW under the Space Launch Initiative. It had a planned sea-level thrust of 650,000 lbf. It was tested at NASA John C. Stennis Space Center throughout 2000. The Stennis test stand results demonstrated that the engine was stable over a wide variety of thrust levels and propellant ratios.TR-106 on astronautix Development of the engine was temporarily discontinued with the cancellation of the Space Launch Initiative. Since 2000, TRW has been acquired by Northrop Grumman and development of the TR-107 RP-1/LOX rocket engine began in 2001 for potential use on next-generation launch and space transportation vehicles is continuing under contract to NASA.Northrop Grumman booster vehicle engines Technology lessons from the Low Cost Pintle Engine project assisted subcontractor development of engines by SpaceX.  Air Force Reusable Booster Program  The Air Force Reusable Booster System program initiated in 2010, and cancelled in 2012, was hoped to renew interest in further development of these engines.

Autobiography The book begins by describing how Barbour's view of time evolved. After taking physics in graduate school, Barbour went to Cologne for Ph.D work on Einstein's theory of gravity. However he became preoccupied with the idea proposed by Ernst Mach that time is nothing but change. A remark by Paul Dirac prompted him to reconsider some mainstream physical assumptions. He worked as a translator of Russian scientific articles and remained outside of academic institutions which provided him time to pursue his research as he desired.Barbour J., Preface. For some twenty years Barbour sought to reformulate physics in the spirit of Mach but found that his results have been already discovered in a different form called ADM formalism. He nearly gave up research, became involved in politics (p. 238) and began writing books on the history of physics. His interest however was rekindled after talking with Lee Smolin and reflecting on quantum mechanics. Barbour came to the conclusion that \\"If the Machian approach to classical dynamics is correct, quantum cosmology will have no dynamics. It will be timeless. It must also be frameless\\" (p. 232). He develops this view in the book. He acknowledges also that John Bell presented in 1980 a \\"quantum mechanics for cosmologists\\" which comes in close agreement with his conclusions, except on the point about the reality of time (p. 301). Possibility Barbour recounts that he read a newspaper article about Dirac's work in which he was quoted as saying: \\"This result has led me to doubt how fundamental the four-dimensional requirement in physics is\\".Dirac P., \\"The Evolution of the Physicist‚Äôs Picture of Nature\\", Scientific American, May 1963. The nature of time as a fourth dimension or something else became the topic of research. Cognisant of the counter- intuitive nature of his fundamental claim, Barbour eases the reader into the topic by first endeavouring to persuade the reader that our experiences are, at the very least, consistent with a timeless universe, leaving aside the question as to why one would hold such a view. Barbour points out that some sciences have long done away with the \\"I\\" as a persisting identity. To take atomic theory seriously is to deny that the cat that jumps is the cat that lands, to use an illustration of Barbour's.Barbour J., p. 46; the example reappears p. 310. The seething nebula of molecules of which we, cats, and all matter are made is ceaselessly rearranging at incomprehensibly fast speeds. The microcosm metamorphoses constantly, therefore one must deny there is any sense to say a cat or a person persists through time. Early on, Barbour addresses the charge that writing with tensed verbs disproves his proposal. The next revolution in physics will undermine speaking in terms of time, he says, but there is no alternative. If a universe is composed of timeless instants in the sense of configurations of matter that do not endure, one could nonetheless have the impression that time flows, Barbour asserts. The stream of consciousness and the sensation of the present, lasting about a second, is all in our heads, literally. In our brains is information about the recent past, but not as a result of a causal chain leading back to earlier instants. Rather, it is a property of thinking things, perhaps a necessary one to become thinking in the first place, that this information is present. In Barbour's words, brains are \\"time-capsules\\". In order to explain away the widely shared stance about past events, Barbour analyses in detail how (historical) 'records' are created. His prime example are traces in a cloud chamber to which he devotes the penultimate chapter of the book. Except for the inexistence of time, he admits that John Bell had already solved most difficulties.Commenting on his \\"Quantum mechanics for cosmologists\\", Barbour writes that \\"his proposal is very close to mine in two of its three main elements. He may have believed in time, but his emphasis on memories and records and their rather natural occurrence in the quantum context are valuable support for me. So are his views on ontology and psychophysical parallelism. This is the third common element\\" (p. 301). See also Bell J., Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics, Cambridge University Press, 1988, . He investigates configuration spaces and best-matching mathematics, fleshing out how fundamental physics might deal with different instants in a timeless scheme. He calls his universe without time and only relative positions \\"Platonia\\" after Plato's world of eternal forms. Plausibility Why, then, is the instant in configuration space, not matter in space-time, the true object and frame of the universe? He marshals as evidence a non- standard analysis of relativity, many-worlds theory and the ADM formalism. Since, he believes, we should be open to physics without time, we must evaluate anew physical laws, such as the Wheeler‚ÄìDeWitt equation, that take on radical but powerful and fruitful forms when time is left out. Barbour writes that our notion of time, and our insistence on it in physical theory, has held science back, and that a scientific revolution awaits. Barbour suspects that the wave function is somehow constrained by the \\"terrain\\" of Platonia. Barbour ends with a short meditation on some of the consequences of \\"the end of time\\". If there is no arrow of time, there is no becoming, but only being. \\"Creation\\" becomes something that is equally inherent in every instant. Criticism and reviews Julian Barbour's research has been published in academic journals and monographs, whereas The End of Time was aimed a more general and philosophically minded public. A number of professional philosophers have responded to the book.Ismael, Jenann. \\"Rememberances, mementos, and time- capsules.\\" Royal Institute of Philosophy Supplement 50 (2002): 317-328;Butterfield J., \\"The End of Time?\\", BJPS 53, 2002, 289-330. There is no general agreement that the ideas expressed elsewhere have any predictive power and thereby constitute a scientific theory. Developing ideas from his book, in 2009 Barbour wrote an essay On the Nature of Time which was awarded first prize in the contest organized by FQXi.Barbour J., On the Nature of Time on Arxiv; Referring to his book, Barbour states that \\"using a few elementary equations and some new arguments, I wish to strengthen the case for eliminating time as a fundamental concept in classical physics\\".

He was famous for his role as Chief Medical Officer of Guinness Brewery, during which time he founded both St James's Gate F.C. and the St John Ambulance Brigade of Ireland. During the Easter Rising of 1916, he was noted for treating anyone who was wounded, regardless of which side they fought for. Early years Sir John Lumsden Sir John Lumsden was born in Drogheda, County Louth, Ireland, the son of John Lumsden, a bank manager, and Florence Isabella Groom Lumsden (n√©e McKean). The father had come from Scotland via India to work in a bank in Armagh and later moved to Dublin in 1867 to work for the Provincial Bank.Sport supplement; Golfing Log By Dermot Gilleece, the Irish Times, 7 December 1996 Lumsden's father was a keen golfer and Lumsden worked with his father and his brother in setting up a rough and ready golf course in 1885 west of the Phoenix Cricket Club, thus establishing Ireland's second oldest golf club, the Dublin Golf Club, which became the Royal Dublin Golf Club in 1891. In 1896, Lumsden married Caroline Frances Kingscote, daughter of Major Fitzhardinge Kingscote and Agnes Grant Stuart, and their first child, John Fitzhardinge Lumsden, was born on 11 June 1897. At the time of the birth they were living at Lumsden's parents house but, soon after, moved out to 4 Fitzwilliam Place, Dublin, where Lumsden also had a medical practice on the first floor.Much of this information came from his grand-daughter, Margery L. Stratton in correspondence with David Foley and reproduced on his website, earlscliffe.com Their first child was soon followed by sisters: Leslie, born in 1898, Norah in 1900, Margery in 1908 and twins, Nancy and Betty born in 1911.  Lifetime achievements  Lumsden was a physician on the staff of Mercer's Hospital in Dublin and in 1902 was the Principal Medical Officer for the Commissioners of Irish Lights.\\"Beam Magazine No. 35, 2006\\", the magazine for the Commissioners of Irish Lights However, it was his role as the Medical Officer (later Chief Medical Officer) at the Guinness Brewery that made Lumsden famous. The Guinness family had a tradition of noblesse oblige and philanthropy and therefore Lumsden's work for Guinness focussed on the well-being of the employees, many of whom lived in appalling conditions in the slums and tenements of inner city Dublin. After the Great Irish Famine (1845‚Äì1846) many people moved from rural areas of Ireland into cities such as Dublin looking for food and work. This resulted in overcrowding with 33.9 percent of all families in Dublin each living in a single room. Poverty and cramped conditions led to problems of disease and by 1881 Dublin had the highest death rate in Europe. Lumsden saw a high rate of tuberculosis amongst Guinness employees and knew that overcrowding was probably a factor. In 1900 he got the approval of the Guinness board to spend two months inspecting the homes of each Guinness employee to ensure that they lived in proper housing and to look for ways to prevent or treat the disease. The main Iveagh Trust buildings built in 1903‚Äì1905 were designed accordingly.F.H.A. Aalen, The Iveagh Trust: the first hundred years 1890‚Äì1990, (Iveagh Trust, Dublin 1990). He also studied the diets of the employees and established cookery classes for the wives of Guinness employees. Finally, he helped to set up the first Guinness sports club which included St James's Gate F.C. In his post as Medical Officer, Lumsden was asked to provide first-aid classes for employees at the Guinness Brewery. The classes became so popular that they later became the first registered division of the St. John Ambulance Brigade of Ireland, which Lumsden founded in 1903 and became the first Commissioner, a post he held until his death.History of The St John Ambulance Brigade in Ireland The Brigade was involved with many major events in Irish history, including treating casualties from the clashes during the General Strike of 1913 (sometimes referred to as the Dublin Lockout). However, the Brigade became prominent in Dublin during the Easter Rising of 1916 where it treated casualties on both sides and fed and cared for evacuees. During the fighting in the streets of Dublin, Lumsden became a familiar figure as he dashed out carrying a white flag and his medical kit to tend to the wounded on both sides.Margery L. Stratton \\"Remembrances of a young American Girl\\", a document sent by Margery to David Foley and partly reproduced on his website, http://www.earlscliffe.com He was knighted by King George V for these acts and for the formation of the St. John Ambulance Society and became Sir John Lumsden KBE. Lumsden also encouraged Brigade members to be blood donors and advertised in the Irish national papers for people to register to set up an 'on call' blood donor panel to serve hospitals in the Dublin area. The service later became the National Blood Transfusion Association in 1948 but owes its origin to the Brigade and more especially to Lumsden.The links to the St. John Ambulance Brigade in Ireland can be found in the web pages of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service here: History of Blood Transfusion In 1923, after the establishment of the Irish Free State, Sir John wrote to the President of the Council of the Irish Free State to start the process of breaking the Brigade away from the control of the British Red Cross Society and the Order of the St John of Jerusalem. This led to the Brigade becoming an Associated Body and completely independent from the English-based St. John AmbulanceSt. John Ambulance Brigade of Ireland and further led to the formation of the Irish Red Cross Society in 1939.Irish Statute Book, No. 206/1939, Irish Red Cross Society Order, 1939 http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1939/en/si/0206.html  Later years  In 1930 Lumsden moved into Earlscliffe in the Baily area of Howth, County Dublin where he practised his other passion: gardening. When Lumsden moved into Earlscliffe the gardens, according to his daughter, Betty L'Estrange, were \\"virtually shrubless and flowerless\\"Letter to the Irish Times on 22 June 1987, reproduced in http://www.earlscliffe.com/history/house/lumsden/the_lumsden_years.html He set about transforming the garden, planting shrubs and building a number of terraces. He also celebrated his work at the St John Ambulance Brigade by building a Maltese cross sundial at Earlscliffe, which gave him \\"enormous pleasure\\". This sundial can still be seen today at Earlscliffe, which later came into the hands of gardener and horticulturalist David Robinson. Lumsden died on 3 September 1944.

Although the location was generally considered to fall in the Lower East Side, it has come to be thought of as part of Chinatown in recent years. It is located a short distance from New York City Hall, Civic Center, and the South Street Seaport. The complex consists of 1,590 apartments in twelve 13-story brick buildings surrounding two courtyards at 10-12-14-16-18-20 Monroe Street and 30-32-34-36-38-40 Monroe Street on the Lower East Side, taking up two whole city blocks and bounded by Catherine Street, Monroe Street, Market Street, and Cherry Street. Knickerboker Village is in ZIP Code 10002. History  The real estate developer Fred F. French began construction of Knickerbocker Village in 1933 and completed it in 1934. As a project of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), which Congress authorized to extend loans to private developers for the construction of low-income housing in slum areas, Knickerbocker Village was the first apartment development in the United States to receive federal funding, with 98% of the money from the project going to the Knickerbocker Village. It provided 1,590 small apartments primarily to small middle-income families. The RFC was supposed to help revive the construction industry and increase the supply of low-income housing in New York. When the United States Congress authorized the RFC to make loans on slum clearance projects, French picked out the worst block in his holdings and presented it as a worthy subject for clearance. His choice was \\"Lung Block,\\" so called because of its high tuberculosis mortality rate, where 650 families lived. French proposed to build a low-cost housing project. RFC lent 97% of the required $10 million. The average cost of \\"Lung Block\\" to Knickerbocker Village was high: $3.116 million, or $14 per square foot. The development's tax assessment was reduced by two-thirds to bring the monthly room rental down to the $12.50 stipulated by the RFC. Because the average rental before construction of the development had been about $5 a room, Knickerbocker Village no longer served the same low-income families that had lived in the \\"Lung Block\\" housing. It was filled with white collar workers. Eighty-two percent of the families who moved into the apartments were soon forced to move back to the slums they had left because of escalating rents. There was a cooperatively run Nursery School started by young mothers and wives of returning World War II Veterans. After fifty years, French sold the complex to new owners in the 1970s. Under that management, over a fifteen-year period, the complex underwent extensive renovation and rejuvenation. Almost $15 million were spent on new windows, new building entrance ways and foyers and waterproofing. The building also has a horticulturist who maintains the extensive gardens in the courtyard located in the center of the building and around the grounds. The complex includes the Hamilton Madison House Knickerbocker Village Senior Service Naturally Occurring Retirement Community (NORC) that offers services and activities for the building's increasing elderly population.

It starred Fernando Guill√©n, Victoria Abril and Jos√© Cerro, and was based on a real crime which occurred in 1913. Plot In Madrid, Manuel S√°nchez, a widower with six children and an elderly father, struggles to support his large family with his meager salary as member of the Spanish army. His passion for gambling does not help his dire circumstances. Manuel's eldest daughter, Maria Luisa, works ironing in a factory. Father and daughter supplement their income skimming out money and jewelry from unsuspected men, who they trap in a relationship with the daughter in order to demand money to repair her honor. Father and daughter also have an incestuous relationship that has been going on for years. While at the casino in the company of his father, Maria Luisa meets Rodrigo Garcia Jal√≥n, a rich old widower. Jal√≥n, who is also a gambler, is smitten by Maria Luisa and begins to entice the young girl into a relationship with her. He offers to provide for her generously if she becomes his lover. Maria Luisa sees the possibility of a life of freedom away from the tight rule of her father. She gleefully accepts Jal√≥n's attention. When Captain S√°nchez realizes what is going on between the widower and Maria Luisa, he convinces his daughter to trap Jal√≥n in one of their skims and blackmail him for a large amount of money. Following that plan, Maria Luisa invites her paramour to her house, pretending to be alone. Captain S√°nchez is hiding, waiting to trap the unsuspected Jal√≥n. All is happening according to plan, but when the captain overhears the sincere love confession of Jal√≥n for his daughter asking to marry him, he becomes outraged. In a fit of jealousy, the Captain grasps an ax and decapitates Jal√≥n. Captain S√°nchez throws the severed head into the fire, and hides the mutilated body on the cellar behind a wall. Meanwhile, Maria Luisa cleans the crime scene. They have gained little money from the crime, except for a ring Jal√≥n was wearing and a token from the casino for a large amount of money. The disappearance of Jal√≥n causes intrigue among the people who knew him, particularly at the casino, where it is a well-known fact that he has not claimed the money from his gambling wins. Maria Luisa goes to the casino to try and cash out the token, which immediately makes her a suspect. When the police come to search her house, they find the mutilated body hidden behind a wall in the cellar. Father and daughter are arrested. Maria Luisa, who initially denied any knowledge of the crime, later recants her story implicating her father. She also accuses him of sexually abusing her for many years; they had two children together who died shortly after birth. Captain S√°nchez also talks against her daughter proclaiming his innocence, but he says the dishonor his daughter has brought upon him is more than he can bear, and he asks for the death penalty. During the trial, the lawyers acting for daughter and father blame each other. The captain is condemned to death, and Maria Luisa is sentenced to 30 years in jail. After Captain S√°nchez is executed in an open field, Maria Luisa receives the rosary her father held up to the end. A voice-over informs viewers that she eventually lost her sanity, and died in prison twelve years after her father.

He organised defences, fortifying the Spanish fortresses along the French border. This could not prevent Spain and its defences from playing a minor part in the following Franco-Dutch War (1672‚Äì1678). He was recalled to Spain on 8 February 1675. On 25 May 1677 he was named Viceroy of Catalonia, where he was also confronted with a French invasion. In 1678 he returned to Madrid where he became President of Flanders. He was admitted to the State Council in 1693. In 1705 under the French king Philip V of Spain he left the State Council together with the Marquis of Mancera. In 1710 his wife died without issue and M√©ndez de Haro decided to dedicate the rest of his life to God and became a Catholic priest.

Mainly remembered for his involvement in the 1740 Batavia massacre, Valckenier later died in a prison in Batavia (present-day Jakarta). Biography Valckenier's father, an alderman and secretary in Amsterdam, was an official of the Dutch East India Company based in Amsterdam. Valckenier's grandfather was Gillis Valckenier, one of the great regents of Amsterdam during the later Dutch Golden Age. On 22 October 1714, Adriaan left on board the ‚ÄòLinschoten‚Äô to be assistant buyer (onderkoopman) in the Dutch East Indies, where he arrived on 21 June 1715 at Batavia. In 1726, he became merchant and chief buyer (opperkoopman); in 1727 he was \\"Accountant General\\" (boekhouder-generaal) of the Dutch Indies; in 1730, he was appointed to the Council of the Indies (Raad extra-ordinair), and, in 1733, as a full \\"Councillor\\". In 1736, he was made \\"First Councillor\\" and \\"Director-General\\", but was beaten to the post of Governor General by Abraham Patras. When Patras died (3 May 1737), Valckenier was named Governor General by the Council of the Indies on 3 May 1737. The Chinese Massacre of 1740 It was during the rule of Adriaan Valckenier that the notorious slaughter of Chinese took place in Batavia (the so-called Chinese Massacre). A previous Governor General (Henricus Zwaardecroon) had encouraged many Chinese to come to Batavia. The population was approaching 50% of Chinese provenance. They worked in the construction of the houses and fortifications of Batavia and on the sugar plantations outside the city. Many Chinese merchants also took a leading, if (from the Dutch point of view) illegal, role in the trade with China. From 1725 the sugar trade began to collapse, partly because of competition from BrazilMassacre of 10,000 Chinese and coffee was added.South East Asia Since 1800 By Greg Purcell Unemployment in the countryside grew, and along with that, unrest. This spread to Batavia as unemployed Chinese left the countryside to seek work or food relief there. The authorities were alarmed at this and began issuing residence permits, and requiring those with permits to live in specific areas. Unrest grew to a full-scale insurrection in the countryside in September 1740, when the Dutch had suggested transporting unemployed Chinese to other Dutch colonies in Ceylon and South Africa.South East Asia, Colonial History: Imperialism before 1800 By Paul H. Kratoska A rumour spread that they would all be thrown overboard en route, and in some accounts, they died when rioting on the ships. and riots in the countryside exploded.Batavia Riots The Dutch authorities were afraid that the Chinese within Batavia were collaborating with the insurrection and, during 9‚Äì10 October, brutal searches were made of Chinese areas, in which many thousands were killed, often after having been arrested. This \\"massacre\\" lasted three days, followed by many more days of looting and arson, with no obvious government attempt to stop the violence. One estimate is that between 5,000 and 10,000 Chinese (men, women and children) were killed in total. Dismissal and death Gustaaf Willem baron van Imhoff, a colleague and rival of Valckenier, objected to this violence. He was arrested and sent back to the Netherlands, where, unfortunately for Valckenier, Imhoff's views were well received by the Directors. Valckenier had also been accused of mishandling the coffee trade ‚Äì fearing overproduction, he had destroyed over half of the plantations. This resulted in a great loss when he could not supply renewed demand, for which the Directors blamed him and had fined him 168,000 florins. He did not manage his Council very well, and there were many intrigues and brawls among members. Van Imhoff's influence in Amsterdam resulted in Valckenier being dismissed as Governor-General (1741) and recalled to the Netherlands. His functions were transferred to Johannes Thedens. Valckenier had been initially cleared by the Directors of wrongdoing, (and given the rank of admiral) but he was re-arrested on his way home, in Cape Town (25 January 1742), and returned to the castle prison in Batavia to await trial. He arrived on 12 August 1742. A long, slow, investigative process was then begun, which had not been concluded, nearly ten years later, when Valckenier died, still in prison, on 20 June 1751. He was buried without ceremony. Van Imhoff, his greatest antagonist, had been appointed his successor. References Bibliography * Johan Leonard Bluss√© (1981) Batavia 1619‚Äì1740.

It is an adaptation of the H. P. Lovecraft novella The Case of Charles Dexter Ward. Originally intended for a theatrical release, the film was shown at various film festivals before going direct to video in 1992. Plot Claire Ward hires private investigator John March to look into the increasingly bizarre activities of her husband Charles Dexter Ward, an esteemed Rhode Island chemical engineer. Through a series of conversations with John, Claire reveals Charles's recent unexplained isolation in their carriage house, his sudden uncovering of his family history, and their visitation to an abandoned ancestral farmhouse near Pawtuxet where he found a painting of a man named Joseph Curwen, to whom he bears an uncanny resemblance. Since these events, Charles has purchased and moved into the farmhouse, leaving Claire without explanation. Upon investigating, John finds that numerous deliveries are made to the farmhouse, and inquires about them to Charles, who is evasive; Charles explains that he is undertaking routine chemical tests using animal cadavers. Shortly after, an elderly man in a neighboring home is found brutally murdered, only a few remnants of his bones left in the house. Police assume he was attacked and eaten by an animal, but John is skeptical. Claire and John go to visit Charles together, and find him pallid and speaking with an archaic affect. They attempt to extract an explanation from Charles, but he simply tells them he is on \\"the edge of greatness\\", and that in six weeks' time, they will understand. Claire agrees to have Charles committed to a hospital. Doctors find his metabolism to be inexplicably high, triggering ravenous hunger, and attribute his change in demeanor to hormonal issues; however, they are unable to explain his craving for blood and raw meat. Meanwhile, John uncovers a diary in the carriage house from Ezra Ward, Charles's fifth-great grandfather, dated 1771. The diary explains how Ezra had an affair with Joseph's wife Eliza, and that Joseph had been practicing necromancy in catacombs he constructed on his property. After a flood penetrated the catacombs, the townspeople discovered a grotesquely malformed creature in the river, which they burned alive. The diary ends leading up to the townspeople's raid of the Curwen house, and Eliza's admission to Ezra that she was pregnant with Joseph's child; Claire, John, and John's assistant Lonnie surmise that Charles's biological great-grandfather was actually Joseph, not Ezra. John and Lonnie decide to search for catacombs on the farmhouse property with Claire. They uncover the entrance in the house's basement, and inside the catacombs find a laboratory and half-grown creatures in wells; Claire also discovers Charles's briefcase. They attempt to flee but are attacked, and Lonnie is killed by one of the creatures. John leaves a bomb in the catacombs, and he and an injured Claire escape with the briefcase before the house detonates. John takes Claire to the hospital where she is sedated, and the doctor informs him she is pregnant. John goes to visit Charles in the psychiatric institution, and confronts him with the briefcase, which he discovered filled with human bones. He accuses Charles of in fact being the 250-year-old Joseph Curwen, who successfully found a way to conquer death through his necromantic experiments. Joseph admits his identity, and confesses that the bones in the suitcase are those of Charles, whom Joseph killed after Charles raised him from the dead. He explains his plan to regain his health and eventually be discharged from the hospital, after which he can impersonate Charles. Joseph attempts to cannibalize John, but John pours the restorative potion from the laboratory over Charles's bones. Charles's skeleton reanimates, and begins to tear the flesh off Joseph, before the two disappear in a cosmic explosion.

Friedman had developed the Lovecraft property independently of each other. Friedman's version of the script was titled Shatterbrain. While Friedman receives sole writing credit, O'Bannon did incorporate some of his own ideas into the project. O'Bannon's original title for the film was The Ancestor, which was later changed to The Resurrected after being re-cut and altered by the studio for theatrical release. The film was O'Bannon's first project as a director after 1985's The Return of the Living Dead. Release The Resurrected was shown in 1991 in the Official Selection at the Sitges Film Festival in Spain. Reception In their book Lurker in the Lobby: A Guide to the Cinema of H. P. Lovecraft, Andrew Migliore and John Strysik write: \\"The Resurrected is the best serious Lovecraftian screen adaptation to date, with a solid cast, decent script, inventive direction, and excellent special effects that do justice to one of [Lovecraft's] darker tales.\\" Release The film was given a short-lived theatrical release on June 1, 1991. It was then released direct to video on April 15, 1992 by Live Home Video in the United States. It was later released on DVD internationally through Metro Goldwyn Mayer in 2003, and in the United States through Lionsgate in 2005.

It branches from the Glasgow to Ayr line at Kilwinning. The first part was formed when the Ardrossan Railway was built, with the principal objective of facilitating coastwise export of minerals and import of goods to Glasgow, but it was only partly successful. The later Glasgow and South Western Railway extended the line to serve Largs, opening the line throughout in 1885. There is a half-hourly electric passenger train service a far as Ardrossan, and generally hourly from there to Largs. Heavy mineral trains use the route from Hunterston deep water terminal. History Horse drawn trains System diagram of the Largs branchThe twelfth Earl of Eglinton developed Ardrossan Harbour in the early years of the nineteenth century, intending it to be useful for the transport of minerals from Ayrshire by coastal shipping, and as an inwards port to serve Glasgow. He tried to build the Glasgow, Paisley and Ardrossan Canal, but the scheme ran out of money and only reached Johnstone, becoming the Glasgow, Paisley and Johnstone Canal. He next obtained authorisation in 1827 for the Ardrossan and Johnstone Railway, intending to link his truncated canal by a railway. This too failed to reach its full extent, and was only constructed between Ardrossan and Kilwinning, with an eastward mineral branch to Perceton and Doura collieries, which he controlled. The line was horse-operated and the track consisted of cast iron fishbelly rails on stone blocks; the track gauge was 4 ft 6 in (1,372 mm). It opened in 1831, and passengers as well as minerals were carried, at least between Ardrossan and Kilwinning, and it was called the Ardrossan Railway. Within a short time, promoters began raising support for a railway between Glasgow and Ayr, and Glasgow and Kilmarnock. This scheme became the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway (GPK&AR;); it was authorised in 1837, and opened in stages between 1839 and 1840. It was a locomotive railway on the standard gauge, and it intersected the Ardrossan Railway at Kilwinning. By now the antiquated technology of the Ardrossan Railway was obviously a problem, and in 1840 the line was altered to standard gauge and the track modernised for locomotive operation. The railway had not so far been separated financially from the canal company, and the opportunity was now taken to do this; additional capital was raised for the upgrading works.By Act of 23 July 1840.C J A Robertson, The Origins of the Scottish Railway System, 1722 - 1844, John Donald Publishers Ltd, Edinburgh, 1983, , page 68 The GPK&AR; had clear intentions at this stage of forming part of a through route between Glasgow and London, although achieving that was still far off. A rival railway, the Caledonian Railway (CR) now came on the scene with its own plans to reach Carlisle and forming part of the route to London. The CR also considered competing with the GPK&AR; in Ayrshire, and the two companies became deadly rivals; the Ardrossan Railway was physically connected to the GPK&AR;, but if the CR could build a line to reach it, it would have a secure foothold deep in GPK&AR; territory. The Ardrossan company bought shares in the Glasgow, Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway, and the Caledonian Railway bought shares in the Ardrossan Railway, and in 1846 Parliamentary authority was obtained for a lineThe Glasgow, Kilmarnock and Ardrossan Railway, capital ¬£750,000. connecting the two. But by now the financial bubble, in which all manner of railway schemes were being proposed, had burst, and there was no money for building railways. Moreover, a proposed merger of the Ardrossan with the Caledonian was rejected by the former's shareholders in 1847.David Ross, The Glasgow and South Western Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2104, David Ross, The Caledonian‚ÄîScotland's Imperial Railway‚ÄîA History, Stenlake Publishing Ltd, Catrine, 2013, , pages 56 and 57 The Glasgow and South Western Railway The GPK&AR; too found its financial resources strained, and an independent ally, the Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway took a share of building the line to Carlisle. The two companies completed the task on 28 October 1850 and on that day they merged, forming the Glasgow and South Western Railway (G&SWR;). At this time the Ardrossan Railway was operating as a locomotive line; there were four passenger trains each way between Kilwinning and Ardrossan, with stops at Stevenston and Saltcoats stations.Bradshaw's General Steam Navigation and Railway Guide, 3rd mo, (March) 1850, reprinted by Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2012, Finding that the Ardrossan Railway, deep in G&SWR; territory, was now friendless and penniless, the G&SWR; made arrangements to purchase it. This proved a lengthy process, but it was effected on 1 August 1854. Extending to Largs The people of Largs had been hoping for a railway connection since the mid-1850s. In 1864 the G&SWR; started to plan a line from Dalry to Largs; the Caledonian Railway too was planning a connection, from Wemyss Bay. Opposition was immediately experienced from wealthy residents of Fairlie and elsewhere, who saw the incursion of a railway as detrimental. Another attempt was made by the G&SWR; in 1871, also with a frustrating outcome. However, in 1873 a line from Ardrossan (instead of Dalry) to West Kilbride was approved. That section opened to goods trains in March 1878, and passenger trains started operating on 1 May 1878. It made a triangular junction with the existing line at Ardrossan. The hostility to a railway further north had waned, and the G&SWR; was able to open an extension from West Kilbride to Fairlie on 1 June 1880. Onward construction was blocked for the time being by hilly terrain. However, there was a pier used by Clyde steamers, and extension to Fairlie Pier, involving a tunnel section, was opened on 1 July 1882. The station roof was built using materials recovered from the temporary Dunlop Street station in Glasgow. Six passenger trains ran each way daily from St Enoch station in Glasgow to Fairlie Pier. The extension from Fairlie Pier Junction to Largs was over flatter terrain, but there was a long section at the shore line requiring a sea wall. It opened on 1 June 1885. Ten trains ran to and from Glasgow daily.Stephenson Locomotive Society, The Glasgow and South Western Railway, 1850 - 1923, 1950 Competition on the Firth of Clyde Ardrossan lines in 1890, after the arrival of the Caledonian RailwaySome of the early rationale in building the line had been to pre-empt incursion into the area by the rival Caledonian Railway. On 4 September 1888 the Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway (L&AR;), worked by the Caledonian Railway, opened its line to Ardrossan. At first it used a temporary connection to the G&SWR; line there, as its own pier facility was not ready;John Thomas revised J S Paterson, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 6, Scotland, the Lowlands and the Borders, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1984, but on 30 May 1890 it was fully operational, at Montgomerie Pier. There were now two railway-connected piers in Ardrossan, and the Firth of Clyde steamer services were in competition. The Caledonian Railway and it subsidiary the Caledonian Steam Packet Company were successful in abstracting 75% of the G&SWR; trade. Some remarkable accelerations in throughout (rail and steamer) journey times were advertised by both companies, and the G&SWR; further responded by planning a shortening of its route to Fairlie to improve passenger journey times, by building a new line from Dalry, but an 1890 Parliamentary Bill was thrown out. By contrast, Ardrossan Harbour was heavily involved in handling bulk cargo, and the harbour was considerably extended in this period, the new facility opening on 12 April 1891. In 1891 the G&SWR; obtained Parliamentary approval to own and operate its own steamers; previously services had been run in conjunction with independent operators. A second attempt to get approval for a Dalry-to-Fairlie line was rejected in 1892, and for a few years attention was elsewhere. In 1897 the Caledonian Railway re-opened the issue by purchasing Largs Pier. The G&SWR; Largs station was in the centre of the town, not close to the pier, and its railway route from Glasgow was very indirect. The implication was that there would be a revived proposal for the CR to build a shorter line to Largs, and the G&SWR; responded with a proposed line from Kilmacolm to Largs via Inverkip, proposed in 1899. The company secured authorisation purchase Largs Harbour, but the new railway was never built. Competition remained fierce, but by 1910 it became possible to agree a traffic sharing arrangement; the Arran ferry service would be operated by one company at a time, in alternate years; this was agreed in March 1910 between the G&SWR; and the Caledonian Steam Packet Company. Chronology The Ardrossan Railway was opened from Kilwinning to Ardrossan (as well as the Doura colliery branches) as a horse drawn goods line in 1834; passenger operation probably commenced in 1834. It was closed for regauging and upgrading, and re-opened on 17 August 1840. A southward connection was made before 1856 from the Doura branch at Byrehill Junction towards Ayr at Dubbs Junction. An extensive iron works was established in the north-east quadrant of the Ayr and Doura lines where they crossed, rail served from both lines. It was extended by the G&SWR; from Ardrossan (Holm Junction) to West Kilbride in March 1878 for goods trains, and on 1 May 1878 for passengers. It made a triangular junction with the existing line at Ardrossan; the apex nearer the Pier was Castlehill Junction and that nearer West Kilbride was Parkhouse Junction. Passenger trains ran to Ardrossan and reversed there to continue to West Kilbride until South Beach station was opened in 1883. The G&SWR; further extended the line from West Kilbride to Fairlie on 1 June 1880, and from there to Fairlie Pier on 1 July 1882; finally the line was extended to Largs on 1 June 1885. When the L&AR; line was opened, at first it used the G&SWR; Ardrossan Pier by running to \\"Ardrossan\\" (town) station,For many years the stations at Ardrossan were not separately identified. reversing there.

The former Up Line was retained as a non-electrified \\"Up Freight Line\\", serving the facilities at the Hunterston Terminal, which are on both sides of the main line. The present day Passenger trains on the route are operated by Abellio ScotRail. There is typically an hourly service from Glasgow to Largs and an hourly service from Glasgow to Ardrossan Harbour, phased to give a 30-minute interval service between Kilwinning and South Beach. The deep water terminal at Hunterston provides a considerable volume of heavy mineral traffic on the line, some of which uses the Byrehill Junction spur to reverse at Barassie en route to English destinations.

Their name is a reference to the 1965 horror movie of the same name starring Boris Karloff (which was very loosely based on the H. P. Lovecraft story \\"The Colour Out of Space\\"). The band are also known as DMD. History Initially formed in 1995 as Casa Diablo by frontman Huey \\"Zero Delorean\\" Diablo and drummer Shane \\"Meatwhistle\\" Diablo, Casa Diablo released two albums before disbanding in 2000. Later in 2000, Delorean and Meatwhistle re-emerged as Diemonsterdie. Including the years as Casa Diablo, DMD has endured 17 years as a band, and to date have released eight full-length studio records, a limited edition split 7\\" vinyl (with fellow horror punks The Crimson Ghosts of Germany) and a live album. Reviews of DMD records have appeared in publications all over the world, most notably in the pages of Rue Morgue Magazine and on Rue Morgue Radio. The band's seventh album, Fall to Your Knees (2010), was received well and featured in a glowing review on Fear Net in November 2010. During their long tenure, Diemonsterdie have shared the stage with fellow shock rock / horror punk / grave rock legends 45 Grave, The Misfits, GWAR, Type O Negative, Celtic Frost, Graves, Impaler, Lizzy Borden and Dr. Chud's X-Ward, among many others. Despite commanding a global audience of thousands and a loyal worldwide fan base, the band has never been signed to a major label. In 2003, DMD formed their own indie horror-punk label Doctor Cyclops Records, which has served as the US label not only for Diemonsterdie, but other top acts in the genre, such as the Crimson Ghosts (Germany), Left For Dead (USA), The Dead Next Door (Sweden), Others (USA) and The Nightshift (Sweden). Currently Dr. Cyclops provides digital distribution for all of these bands with exception of the Crimson Ghosts. In recent years, Dr. Cyclops Digital has also signed the up- and-coming German band, Jamey Rottencorpse and the Rising Dead. The band consists of four members; founding members, lead singer Zero Delorean and drummer Shane \\"Meatwhistle\\" Diablo and more recent additions, Mercury Rising as lead guitarist and Bassist Grimlock Morgue. Past members include guitarist Shadow Windhawk and bassist Stikki Nixx. In 2012, after drifting into a status of relative obscurity since the release of the band's seventh studio album, Fall to Your Knees, DMD have since made it back into the eye of the horror punk scene and on August 11, 2012, the band successfully crowd funded a $6,000 project to release October 21st, 1976 on 12\\" limited edition vinyl in 2013. The album will feature 13 unreleased tracks celebrating 13 years since Casa Diablo transformed into Diemonsterdie and officially began defining themselves as horror punk. 2012 has also seen the revival of Diemonsterdie's free fan club, the secret order of the Zealots of the Bloody Circle. In July 2012, the band elected Steven Godfrey, an American fan from PA, as the president of the Zealots of the Bloody Circle.

Her case was one of the most documented of the many witch trials in Norway in the 16th and 17th centuries. Together with Lisbeth Nypan, she was perhaps the most famous victim of the accusation in Norway.  Biography  Anne Pedersdotter was born in the city of Trondheim, Norway. She was the daughter of an official and was the sister of an official of Trondheim, S√∂ren Pedersson. In 1552, she married Absalon Pedersson Beyer (1528‚Äì75), a Lutheran clergyman and a professor in theology in the city of Bergen, where they lived. In 1575, Anne was accused of having killed her husband's uncle, Bishop Gjeble Pedersson, by sorcery, in order to make her husband bishop. She was freed from the charges through her husband's connections, as he managed to get her a pardon from the King of Denmark-Norway. The year after this, she became a wealthy widow, freed from taxes by the king. Once accused of witchcraft, however, she was always considered a witch. She lived isolated, and she reacted to the rumors with hostility and by arguing with people. The rumors became worse and worse over the years. In March 1590, she was accused a second time. She refused to attend the trial, and was fetched to it by force. During the trial, she was accused of having murdered six people by making them sick by magic. The witnesses were friends and neighbors. Her maid Elina accused her of having used her as a riding horse to a witches' Sabbath, where the witches planned to burn down the city. Others claimed they had seen her in the presence of demons. During the trial, Anne reportedly displayed \\"willpower, clearsight and skill\\". On the accusation of having killed a child, she replied: \\"Many children die in the town, I have not killed them all\\". Despite protests from some ministers in Bergen clergy, she was sentenced to death. In Norway, witches were generally burned alive, and Anne received this sentence. On the way to the execution, she cried out her innocence several times. Anne Pedersdotter was burned alive at the stake in the city of Bergen on the 7 April 1590. Her case is regarded as the starting point of the many witch trials in Norway (Trolldomssakene i Norge) in the 17th century, especially in Finnmark from Vard√∏ witch trials (1621). Legacy Anne Pedersdotter, a drama in four acts by Norwegian playwright, Hans Wiers-Jenssen was performed in 1909. This inspired La fiamma (1934) an opera by Italian composer Ottorino Respighi and the film Day of Wrath (1943) directed by Danish filmmaker Carl Theodor Dreyer. Pedersdotter was also the subject of Anne Pedersdotter, an opera by Norwegian composer Edvard Fliflet Br√¶in with libretto by Hans Kristiansen. In 1977, Norwegian author Vera Henriksen released the novel Skj√¶rsild featuring aspects of the story. A memorial stone titled the Witch Stone (Heksesteinen p√• Nordnes) was erected as a monument to the victims of witch trials in Norway. It was unveiled on 26 June 2002 at Nordnesparken in the Nordnes neighbourhood of Bergen. The inscription translates to 350 bonfire victims to miscarriage of justice 1550‚Äì1700. The 2009 album \\"Throw Money\\" by independent musician Kevin Loy features the composition Suite: Anne Pedersdotter. The Norwegian band Kvelertak wrote a song titled Witch Burning (Heksebrann) for their 2016 album Nattesferd. The circumstances around Anne Pedersdotter are described in the song.

The play was first broadcast on RT√â radio in 1965. The play is written entirely in the Irish language and has been on the curriculum for the Leaving Certificate examinations since 2006. Plot summary The play is set in Ireland during the 1960s and deals with the pregnancy, and subsequent single motherhood, of a young woman, M√°ire N√≠ Chathasaigh. She is shunned by her family after becoming impregnated by P√°draig, a married man and a teacher in the local school, and must leave her parish and move to Dublin to find work to support herself and her child. Here she is once again marginalised, first for being a single pregnant woman and then for being single mother. After her accommodation collapses around her child, she moves into a brothel with a prostitute named Mail√≠ who took pity on her. An encounter with the child's father, where he further rejects her and his child, only serves to make matters worse and the girl takes her own life in a similar way to poet Sylvia Plath, as well as that of her child, by natural gas inhalation from her oven. It often goes back and forth between \\"flashbacks\\" (memories of M√°ire, the protagonist) and the trial. At the beginning, M√°ire's mother is introduced, and proceeds to state she is a god- fearing woman who has done nothing wrong. Throughout the play, this is typical of most characters. Main characters M√°ire She is the protagonist of the play. Her key flaw is her loyalty. She is very sheltered and naive due to her upbringing. As a young woman she falls in love with P√°draig, a school teacher, at a dance. M√°ire was raised with no knowledge of men and the like, as her mother raised her to be only a nun. She was only allowed to enter dances due to the priest being there. During the play, M√°ire's love for P√°draig never falters. Proof of this is seen how, even after his betrayal throughout the flashbacks, she never breaks her promises to \\"Never to mention [his] name\\", \\"Never to write to\\" him and to \\"Never tell anyone about\\" their relationship. When she becomes pregnant, she is thrown out by her mother, and goes to Dublin, where she meets Mail√≠, a prostitute, who shows her kindness by telling her of the Social Worker's plans to give her baby up for adoption. M√°ire rejects this plan, and after an accident that caused her house to collapse around her baby while she was at work, Mail√≠ takes her in before she meets with P√°draig. She kills herself and her baby after this meeting, because P√°draig rejects her and anything to do with the child. Throughout the flashbacks in which she and P√°draig meet, she is constantly told that he loves her, and would marry her, were he not married. Hence, when she finds out from a friend, a year later, that his wife died a month after she was thrown out, M√°ire has an emotional breakdown, and in finding out that he has remarried since, commits the fatal act in the penultimate scene. P√°draig The school teacher responsible for M√°ire's pregnancy. During their meetings and even when they met at the dance, he is constantly teasing and testing her, manipulating her, making her feel pity for him while enticing her all the more. He convinces her that he has married her \\"With this ring, I marry you\\", although stating beforehand he could not marry her because his own wife, N√≥ra, is ill but alive. This pretend marriage, which he knows is fake but she does not, is a ploy to try to get M√°ire to sleep with him. He is unfaithful to his wife as she is dying, and is also unfaithful to his new wife as he goes to the house of ill repute to get the services of a prostitute such as Mail√≠. Bean U√≠ Chathasaigh The mother of M√°ire, Liam and Se√°n, an ambitious widow who has made many sacrifices for her children and plans to have her children feed her own ambition. A 'Christian' woman, she forces her son Sean into the priesthood, and tries to force M√°ire into being a nun until she falls pregnant. Her main worry is not for her daughter but herself being \\"embarrassed in front of the neighbours!\\" She tries to give M√°ire alcohol in order to abort the baby, and stands up in court defending this- \\"It's not a sin to put an end to something unclean, something damned by God and by people\\". She seems not to care that her daughter is dead, only that she had been given a Catholic upbringing, and that it was M√°ire's own fault that she was marginalised.  North American Premiere  The show premiered in North America in its English translation at the University of Pittsburgh Stages Rauh Studio Theatre on April 19th, 2019, directed by Nic Barilar. It was presented as part of the Year of Pitt Global, featuring post-show talks from scholars of nearby universities specializing in Irish Culture.  Reception  Chris Morash placed it on a level with Brian Friel's Philadelphia, Here I Come! and Eugene McCabe's King of the Castle.

October 19, 1747January 4, 1809) was a Continental Army officer from Boston, Massachusetts during the American Revolutionary War. For most of the war he was colonel of Jackson's Additional Continental Regiment, which was redesignated the 16th Massachusetts in 1780. He commanded the last regiment of the Continental Army, the 1st American, which was disbanded in 1784. Jackson was a lifelong friend of Henry Knox another Continental Army officer, whose business affairs he was also heavily involved in. Life Jackson was the youngest son of Joseph and Susannah (Gray) Jackson. Before the American Revolutionary War, he was an officer of the First Corps of Cadets in Boston, which was disbanded during the British occupation. After the evacuation, six former cadet officers organized a company of seventy-eight officers and men called the Boston Independent Company on 17 March 1776, with Jackson as their commander. In January 1777, the unit was taken into Continental service, designated Jackson's Additional Continental Regiment. He led his regiment in the Philadelphia campaign of 1777, at Monmouth and Rhode Island in 1778, and at Springfield, New Jersey in 1780. In 1780 the regiment was taken into the Massachusetts Line and renamed the 16th Massachusetts Regiment. Jackson's regiment was disbanded in 1781 and Jackson was transferred to command the 4th Massachusetts Regiment. He received a brevet promotion to brigadier general on September 30, 1783 and led Continental forces into New York City on the heels of the British evacuation in November. The 4th Massachusetts was disbanded on November 3, 1783, at West Point, New York. Jackson was retained as commander the 1st American Regiment (1783-1784), which was the only infantry unit still active after the dissolution of the Continental Army in November. Jackson was discharged from the Army on June 20, 1784 when the 1st Regiment was disbanded and the standing army was reduced to only 80 soldiers. In 1783 Jackson became an original member of the Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati. He later served as a Major general in the Massachusetts militia from 1792 until 1796 and was the agent supervising the building of the frigate USS Constitution at Boston in 1797. He was a lifelong close friend of Major-General Henry Knox, and acted as his agent in his business affairs (particularly those concerning Knox's vast land holdings in Maine) while the General was Secretary of War. Other close associates included Hepzibah Swan of Boston, in whose household Jackson lived for some years.Eleanor Pearson DeLorme. The Swan Commissions: Four Portraits by Gilbert Stuart.

The document is addressed to a community member known only as 'B' (traditionally associated with Brocard, although no historical records exist that clearly identify this individual's full name). Receiving the Rule marks the origin of the Carmelite Order. Tradition says that Brocard was well-versed in Scripture and that Albert planned to take him to the next Lateran Council, but was murdered before the Council took place. Brocard died around 1231. His cult was ordered by the general chapter of 1564. It was removed from the reformed breviary of 1585, but taken up again in 1609; and the proper lessons were approved by the S. Congregation of Rites in 1672. His feast has been again suppressed.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and on February 26, 1961, he led one of the first major civil rights protests in the Dayton, Ohio community.DaytonDailyNews: Dayton, Ohio, news and information He challenged segregation in Dayton before the Civil Rights Movement gained attention nationally. McIntosh tried negotiation first. If that didn't work, he roused blacks to push for their rights by picketing, sit-ins and boycotts. He utilized nonviolent methods to fight for the rights of minorities to work at Rike's department store, Liberal supermarket, and other establishments in the Dayton area. McIntosh organized community groups and was the executive director of the Dayton chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). On March 4, 1974, McIntosh was shot in the heart and killed by Calvin Farmer outside his family-owned store while trying to prevent a robbery at a jewelry store in downtown Dayton. Recognition In recognition of W. S. McIntosh's heroic efforts and civic responsibility, the City of Dayton has named a park in his honor - W. S. McIntosh Park. Dayton community and University of Dayton leaders offered a public salute to W. S. McIntosh in June 2007 at the Dayton Cultural and RTA Center. In conjunction with the University of Dayton, they sponsor a scholarship for minority students who reside in the city of Dayton. This scholarship, the W. S.

The evicted were sent back to Jaffna, Vavuniya, Trincomalee and Batticaloa, where they are originally from, in several buses with a police escort. However the buses only went as far as the town of Vavuniya and the evicted Tamils were forced to stay in a detention camp. The President asked those who were evicted to come back to Colombo and ordered an investigation into the incident  Background to the Expulsion  The Tamil militant Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam organization (the LTTE or the \\"Tamil Tigers\\"), which is banned as a terrorist organization in 32 countries including the United States, Canada and member nations of the European Union, has carried out numerous bombings in Colombo, the largest city in Sri Lanka, over the course of the Sri Lankan Civil War.Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (Sri Lanka, separatists) - Council on Foreign Relations The breakdown of the Norwegian-backed peace process saw an increase in IED explosions and suicide bombings, attributed by the Sri Lanka Police, to the LTTE in Colombo. In May 2007, at least three such explosions took place in the city, including an attack on a military vehicle that killed seven civilians and one police officer.Roadside bomb kills seven near Sri Lanka military base Police investigations identified that those responsible for a number of these bombings had temporarily lived in and planned their attacks from low budget lodges in the city.OCCUPATION OF LODGINGS The Sri Lanka Police said that, for instance, there were occasions where some individuals had lived in these lodges for over six months on the pretext that they had come to obtain their passports, which could be obtained in as little as one day.Department of Immigration and Emigration, Passport fees Therefore, the Sri Lanka Police said: > \\"Temporary occupants who cannot provide valid reasons for their stay in the > Colombo area will be sent back to their homes\\"  Expulsion  On the morning of June 7, heavily armed Sri Lanka Police officers entered low-budget hostels in the Wellawatte, Dehiwala, Kotahena, Pettah and Wattala areas of Colombo and asked 376 persons, comprising 291 males and 85 females, who did not have valid reasons for being in Colombo to leave. They were then put into buses and were sent away from Colombo to destinations in the east and north of Sri Lanka. People were taken to the town of Vavuniya and made to stay in a detention camp. On the next day they were handed over to Government officials of Vavuniya.  Concern  The move to expel these people drew wide criticism of the government. The United States Embassy in Sri Lanka condemned the act, asking the government of Sri Lanka to ensure the constitutional rights of all the citizens of the country. Norway also condemned the act, describing it as a clear violation of international human rights law. Their press release urged government of Sri Lanka to desist from any further enforced removals. Canada has also condemned the action. The expulsion was also condemned in the Sri Lankan media. Eight human rights groups wrote a joint letter to the President claiming that act was \\"a flagrant violation of (freedom of movement) and a disgrace to humanity\\". ;Allegation of Ethnic cleansing Human rights groups, Local think tank and other observers have termed this act as \\"ethnic cleansing\\". Apex court halts eviction of Tamils from Colombo The media group said that this type of act reminds people of what \\"Hitler did to the Jews\\", and the Asian Center of Human Rights urged India to intervene.  Eyewitness Accounts  One of the men who was forced to leave Colombo managed to call a local radio station, Sirisa FM from a mobile phone. He said; A 64-year-old woman from Jaffna, who was among those evicted said that; Another 54-year-old woman was quoted as saying;  Aftermath  The Sri Lankan Supreme Court on June 8, 2007 issued an injunction on the Sri Lanka Police to stop the evacuation of residents of Colombo lodges after hearing a fundamental rights petition filed by a non governmental organization, the Center for Policy Alternatives, Sri Lanka (CPA). As a result of the ruling, police boarded 185 out of the 270 people who were sent to Vavuniya onto five buses and took them back to Colombo. President Mahinda Rajapaksa reprimanded his police chief for the deportations and ordered the Inspector General of the Police to present a report on the manner of transportation of the Tamils and on the alleged exceeding of authority by the officials involved. He has also invited the people who were sent to Vavuniya to return to Colombo.  Government reaction  On June 10, 2007 Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ratnasiri Wickremanayake told reporters that the government regretted the eviction of 376 Tamils from Colombo and that he accepted responsibility of the incident. He promised that this kind of incident would not recur.

He published or co-authored more than two dozen books and 120 scholarly articles. His most important works emphasize the agricultural preconditions necessary for industrialization or argue that colonization was not beneficial to colonial populations. He argued that tariffs and growth were positively correlated in the 19th century. He rejects as myth the notion that colonialism played a crucial role in causing the economic development of the West.Anne-M. Piuz, \\"Paul Bairoch (1930-1999)\\" Journal of European Economic History (2000) 29#1 pp 203‚Äì208. Academic career Bairoch gained a bachelor's degree by correspondence, intending to become an engineer but he turned to studying economic history in 1956 at the parisian Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes. He obtained his doctorate in 1963 at the Free University of Brussels where he worked from 1965 to 1995. He was economic adviser to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) at Geneva from 1967 to 1969, professor at the Sir George Williams University (Concordia) in Montr√©al from 1969 to 1971 and on recommendation of Fernand Braudel became director of studies at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes from 1971 to 1972. In 1972 he was made professor of history at the University of Geneva. He retired in 1995. He was also visiting professor at Harvard and at the Coll√®ge de France (1983) and Doctor honoris causa at the ETH Zurich. From 1985, Bairoch directed a number of research projects on the world economy at a Centre for International Economic History in Geneva. Research Paul Bairoch sought through quantitative, empirical research of historical trends to question and challenge many beliefs which are nowadays generally accepted in economics (see in particular his work Economics and World History: Myths and Paradoxes), among which: the idea that free trade historically led to periods of economic growth; that moving away from free trade caused the Great Depression; and that colonial powers in the 19th and early 20th centuries became rich by exploiting the Third World. Bairoch argued that such beliefs are based on insufficient knowledge and misguided interpretations of the economic history of the United States, Europe and the Third World. He researched extensively the reasons why an industrial takeoff was prevented in the colonised countries of the Third World (see e.g. his book R√©volution industrielle et sous-d√©veloppement). He is particularly known for his detailed empirical research on economic problems of Third World countries, on the industrial revolution and its aftermath and on urban history. His historical estimates of Gross Product measures are still being referred to in the literature, although some are also challenged by other economic historians such as Angus Maddison. Bairoch argues that free trade contributed to deindustrialization in the Ottoman Empire. In contrast to the protectionism of China, Japan, and Spain, the Ottoman Empire had a liberal trade policy, open to foreign imports. This has origins in capitulations of the Ottoman Empire, dating back to the first commercial treaties signed with France in 1536 and taken further with capitulations in 1673 and 1740, which lowered duties to 3% for imports and exports. The liberal Ottoman policies were praised by British economists such as J. R. McCulloch in his Dictionary of Commerce (1834), but later criticized by British politicians such as Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, who cited the Ottoman Empire as \\"an instance of the injury done by unrestrained competition\\" in the 1846 Corn Laws debate: Quotes Paul Bairoch referred here to colonialism and to the exploitation of the third world in the 19th and early 20th century. He argued that this exploitation was not indispensable for industrialisation. This he thought is \\"good news\\" for the third world because it means that development could occur without exploitation of other regions.

History The initial request of a light at this site was made in 1897, but construction was delayed until 1901 after the Variety Iron Works Company failed to deliver materials in time. Unlike earlier caisson lights in the bay, the foundation was placed using the pneumatic process, in which the caisson is kept under pressure to expel water, and the interior is excavated to bring the cylinder down to the desired depth. The tower is taller than other Maryland sparkplug lights because of the provision for a watch room as well as a lantern atop the tower, the only example in the state. A fog bell was originally housed on the lower gallery but was later moved to the watch room level, a backup to the fog horn added in the 1930s. The characteristic was changed several times through the years, with different patterns of flashes and eclipses. Along with many other Chesapeake Bay lights, automation came in the early 1960s. In 1976 the original fourth-order Fresnel lens was stolen, and it was replaced with a solar-power lamp.

Horthy nominally represented the Hungarian monarchy. In reality there was no king. Attempts by Charles IV to return to the throne were prevented by Horthy. Hungary under Horthy was characterized by its conservative, nationalist and fiercely anti-communist character. The government was based on an unstable alliance of conservatives and right- wingers. Foreign policy was characterized by revisionism - the total or partial revision of the Treaty of Trianon, which had seen Hungary lose over 70% of its historic territory along with over three million Hungarians, who mostly lived in the border territories outside the new borders of the kingdom. Hungary's interwar politics were dominated by an obsession with the territorial losses suffered in this treaty. Germany's influence in Hungary has led some historians to consider that the country increasingly became a client state of Germany after 1938.Seamus Dunn, T.G. Fraser. Europe and Ethnicity: The First World War and Contemporary Ethnic Conflict. Routledge, 1996. P97. The Kingdom of Hungary was an Axis Power during World War II and focused to regain Hungarian majority territory which had been lost in the Treaty of Trianon, achieving this goal in early 1941. By 1944, following heavy setbacks for the Axis, Horthy's government negotiated secretly with the Allies, and also considered leaving the war. Because of this Hungary was occupied by Germany and Horthy was deposed. The extremist Arrow Cross Party's leader Ferenc Sz√°lasi established a new Nazi-backed government, effectively turning Hungary into a German-occupied puppet state. After World War II, Hungary fell within the Soviet Union's sphere of influence. It changed its name to the Hungarian State (Hungarian: Magyar √Ållam) and the Second Hungarian Republic was soon thereafter established in 1946. In 1949, the communist Hungarian People's Republic was founded.  Formation  Upon the dissolution and break- up of Austria-Hungary after World War I, the Hungarian Democratic Republic and then the Hungarian Soviet Republic were briefly proclaimed in 1918 and 1919, respectively. The short-lived communist government of B√©la Kun launched what was known as the \\"Red Terror\\", involving Hungary in an ill-fated war with Romania. In 1920, the country fell into a period of civil conflict, with Hungarian anti-communists and monarchists violently purging the nation of communists, leftist intellectuals, and others whom they felt threatened by, especially Jews. This period was known as the \\"White Terror\\". In 1920, after the pullout of the last of the Romanian occupation forces, the Kingdom of Hungary was restored. After the collapse of a short-lived Communist regime, according to historian Istv√°n De√°k: :Between 1919 and 1944 Hungary was a rightist country. Forged out of a counter-revolutionary heritage, its governments advocated a ‚Äúnationalist Christian‚Äù policy; they extolled heroism, faith, and unity; they despised the French Revolution, and they spurned the liberal and socialist ideologies of the 19th century. The governments saw Hungary as a bulwark against bolshevism and bolshevism‚Äôs instruments: socialism, cosmopolitanism, and Freemasonry. They perpetrated the rule of a small clique of aristocrats, civil servants, and army officers, and surrounded with adulation the head of the state, the counterrevolutionary Admiral Horthy. Istv√°n De√°k, ‚ÄúHungary‚Äù in Hans Roger and Egon Weber,eds., The European right: A historical profile (1963) p 364-407 quoting p. 364. A kingdom without a king Mikl√≥s Horthy, Regent of Hungary On 29 February 1920, a coalition of right-wing political forces united and returned Hungary to being a constitutional monarchy. However, it was obvious that the Allies would not accept any return of Charles IV. It was thus decided to select a regent to represent the monarchy. Mikl√≥s Horthy, the last commanding admiral of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, was chosen for this position on 1 March. S√°ndor Simonyi-Semadam was the first Prime Minister of Horthy's regency. In 1921 Charles IV returned in Hungary and tried to retake its throne, even trying to march on Budapest with some rebel troops in October 1921; however, his attempts failed as much of the army remained loyal to Horthy and thus Charles was arrested and exiled to Madeira. On 6 November 1921 the Diet of Hungary passed a law nullifying the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713, dethroning Charles IV and abolishing the House of Habsburg's rights to the throne of Hungary. Hungary was a kingdom without royalty. With civil unrest too great to select a new king, it was decided to confirm Horthy as Regent of Hungary. He remained in that powerful president-like status until overthrown in 1944.Thomas Sakmyster, Hungary's Admiral on Horseback (East European Monographs, 1994).  Government  Standard of the Regent of Hungary Horthy's rule as Regent possessed characteristics such that it could be construed a dictatorship. As a counterpoint, his powers were a continuation of the constitutional powers of the King of Hungary, adopted earlier during the federation with the Austrian Empire.Sinor, Denis. 1959. History of Hungary, London: George Allen and Unwin Ltd. Pp. 289 As Regent, Horthy had the power to adjourn or dissolve the Hungarian Diet (parliament) at his own discretion; he appointed the Hungarian Prime Minister.Sinor, p. 289 The succession after Horthy's death or abdication was never officially established; presumably the Hungarian Parliament would have selected a new regent, or possibly attempted to restore the Habsburgs under Crown Prince Otto. In January 1942, Parliament appointed Horthy's eldest son Istv√°n as Deputy Regent and expected successor. Whether this represents an attempt to gradually re-establish monarchy in Hungary is unclear; at any rate, Istv√°n was killed in an airplane crash in August that year, and a new Deputy Regent was not appointed. During his first ten years, Horthy led increased repression of Hungarian minorities. In 1920, the numerus clausus law formally placed limits on the number of minority students at university, and legalized corporal punishment for adults in criminal cases. Although the law seemingly applied in equal measure to all minorities, the ethnicity quota system was never fully introduced and the law acted largely to conceal anti-Jewish action from foreign observers. Limitations were relaxed in 1928. Racial criteria in admitting new students were removed and replaced by social criteria. Five categories were set up: civil servants, war veterans and army officers, small landowners and artisans, industrialists, and the merchant classes.See: Numerus Clausus Under Istv√°n Bethlen as Prime Minister the electoral system was changed to reintroduce an open vote system outside Budapest and its vicinity and cities with county municipal rights. His political party, the Party of Unity, won repeated elections. Bethlen pushed for revision of the Treaty of Trianon. After the collapse of the Hungarian economy from 1929 to 1931, national turmoil pushed Bethlen to resign as Prime Minister. In 1938 the changes to the electoral system were reversed. Social conditions in the kingdom did not improve as time passed, as a very small proportion of the population continued to control much of the country's wealth. Jews were continually pressured to assimilate into Hungarian mainstream culture. The desperate situation forced the Regent, Horthy, to accept the far-right politician Gyula G√∂mb√∂s as Prime Minister. He pledged to retain the existing political system. G√∂mb√∂s agreed to abandon his extreme anti-Semitism and allow some Jews into the government. In power, G√∂mb√∂s moved Hungary towards a one- party government like those of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Pressure by Nazi Germany for extreme anti-Semitism forced G√∂mb√∂s out and Hungary pursued anti-Semitism under its \\"Jewish Laws\\". Initially, the government passed laws restricting Jews to 20 percent in a number of professions. Later it scapegoated the Jews for the country's failing economy. In 1944, responding to the advancing Soviet forces, the Regent Mikl√≥s Horthy deposed the pro-German Prime Minister and installed a more balanced government in an effort to engage with the Allies and avoid occupation by the Soviet Union. Shortly afterward, German forces invaded Hungary, deposed Horthy as Regent, and installed a puppet regime led by Ferenc Sz√°lasi of the anti-Semitic and pro-Nazi Arrow Cross Party. The Arrow Cross Party never abolished the Monarchy as a form of government, and Hungarian newspapers continued to refer to the country as the Kingdom of Hungary (Magyar Kir√°lys√°g), although Magyarorsz√°g (Hungary) was used as an alternative.Budapesti K√∂zl√∂ny, 17 October 1944Hivatalos K√∂zl√∂ny, 27 January 1945 From May to June 1944, Hungarian authorities rapidly rounded up and transported hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews to Nazi concentration camps, where most died. After the fall of the Sz√°lasi regime, a Soviet-backed government under B√©la Mikl√≥s was nominally left in control of the entire country. A High National Council was appointed in January to assume the Regency, and included members of the Hungarian Communist Party, like Ern≈ë Ger≈ë, and later M√°ty√°s R√°kosi and L√°szl√≥ Rajk.  Economy  Upon the kingdom's establishment soon after World War I, the country suffered from economic decline, budget deficits, and high inflation as a result of the loss of economically important territories under the Treaty of Trianon, including Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia.Signor, pp. 290 The land losses of the Treaty of Trianon in 1920 caused Hungary to lose agricultural and industrial areas, making it dependent on exporting products from what agricultural land it had left to maintain its economy. Prime Minister Istv√°n Bethlen's government dealt with the economic crisis by seeking large foreign loans, which allowed the country achieve monetary stabilization in the early 1920s. He introduced a new currency in 1927, the peng≈ë.Signor, pp. 290. Industrial and farm production rose rapidly, and the country benefited from flourishing foreign trade during most of the 1920s. Following the start of the Great Depression in 1929, the prosperity rapidly collapsed in the country, especially in part due to the economic effects of the failure of the √ñsterreichische Creditanstalt bank in Vienna, Austria.Signor, pp. 291. From the mid-1930s to the 1940s, after relations improved with Germany, Hungary's economy benefited from trade. The Hungarian economy became dependent on that of Germany.  Foreign policy  Istv√°n Bethlen, Prime Minister of Hungary. Initially, despite a move towards nationalism, the new state under Horthy, in an effort to prevent further conflicts, signed the Treaty of Trianon on 4 June 1920, thereby reducing Hungary's size substantially: the whole of Transylvania was taken by Romania; much of Upper Hungary became part of Czechoslovakia; Vojvodina was assigned to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (known after 1929 as Yugoslavia); and the Free State of Fiume was created. With a succession of increasingly nationalist Prime Ministers, Hungary steadily came to repent the Treaty of Trianon, and aligned itself with Europe's two fascist states, Germany and Italy, which both opposed the changes to national borders in Europe at the end of World War I. The Italian Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini sought closer ties with Hungary, beginning with the signing of a treaty of friendship between Hungary and Italy on 5 April 1927.Sinor, pp. 291. Gyula G√∂mb√∂s was an open admirer of the fascist leaders.Sinor, pp. 291 G√∂mb√∂s attempted to forge a closer trilateral unity between Germany, Italy and Hungary by acting as an intermediary between Germany and Italy, whose two fascist regimes had nearly come to conflict in 1934 over the issue of Austrian independence. G√∂mb√∂s eventually persuaded Mussolini to accept Hitler's annexation of Austria in the late 1930s. G√∂mb√∂s is said to have coined the phrase \\"axis\\", which he applied to his intention to create an alliance with Germany and Italy; those two countries used it to term their alliance as the Rome‚ÄìBerlin axis. Just prior to the Second World War, Hungary benefited from its close ties with Germany and Italy when the Munich Agreement obliged Czechoslovakia and Hungary to settle their territorial disputes by negotiation. Finally, the First Vienna Award reassigned the southern parts of Czechoslovakia to Hungary, and shortly after Czechoslovakia was abolished Hungary occupied and annexed the remainder of the Carpatho-Ukraine.  World War II  The Kingdom of Hungary in 1941 After the successful revision policy Hungary sought further solutions to the remainder of its former territories and demanded the concession of Transylvanian territory from Romania. The Axis powers were not interested in opening a new conflict in Central Europe; both countries were facing strong diplomatic pressures to avoid any military operations. Finally both parties accepted the arbitration of Germany and Italy, known as the Second Vienna Award, and as a result Northern Transylvania was assigned to Hungary. Shortly afterward, the Kingdom of Hungary joined the Axis powers. Hitler demanded that the Hungarian government follow Germany's military and racial agenda to avoid potential conflict in the future. Anti- Semitism was already an established political cause by the far right in Hungary. In 1944, after the ousting of Horthy by Hitler and before the installation of the National-Socialist Arrow Cross Party, the Hungarian government readily aided Nazi Germany in the deportation of hundreds of thousands of Jews to concentration camps during the Holocaust, where most of them died. In April 1941, Hungary let the Wehrmacht into her territory, thus supporting Germany and Italy in the invasion of Yugoslavia. After the Independent State of Croatia was proclaimed, Hungary joined the military operations and was allowed to annex the Baƒçka (B√°cska) region in Vojvodina, which had a relative majority of Hungarians, as well as the region of Murak√∂z (present-day Prekmurje and Medjimurje), which had large Slovenian and Croatian majorities, respectively. On 27 June 1941, L√°szl√≥ B√°rdossy declared war on the Soviet Union. Fearing a potential turn of support to the Romanians, the Hungarian government sent armed forces to support the German war effort during Operation Barbarossa. This support cost the Hungarians dearly. The entire Hungarian Second Army was lost during the Battle of Stalingrad. Hungarian armor and infantry in retreat, August 1944 By early 1944, with Soviet forces fast advancing from the east, Hungary was caught attempting to contact the British and the Americans to secretly escape the war and establish an armistice with the Allies. On 19 March 1944, the Germans responded by invading Hungary in Operation Margarethe. German forces occupied key locations to ensure Hungarian loyalty. They placed Horthy under house arrest and replaced Prime Minister Mikl√≥s K√°llay with a more pliable successor. D√∂me Szt√≥jay, an avid supporter of the Nazis, became the new Hungarian Prime Minister. Szt√≥jay governed with the aid of a Nazi military governor, Edmund Veesenmayer. By October of the same year, the Hungarians were again caught trying to quit the war, and the Germans launched Operation Panzerfaust. They replaced Horthy with Arrow Cross leader Ferenc Sz√°lasi. A new pro-German \\"Government of National Unity\\" was proclaimed, and it continued the war on the side of the Axis. Sz√°lasi did not replace Horthy as Regent, but was appointed as the \\"Nationleader\\" (Nemzetvezet≈ë) and Prime Minister of the new Hungarian Fascist regime. There has been some debate as to what extent the Hungarian state of the 1930s and '40s can be classified as fascist. However, the regime's increasing economic dependence on Germany, its passage of anti-Semitic legislation and its participation in exterminating local Jews all place it within the realm of international fascism.Richard Griffiths, Fascism, p. 107, 111. London: Continuum, 2005. On 21 December 1944, a Hungarian \\"Interim Assembly\\" met in Debrecen, with the approval of the Soviet Union. This assembly elected an interim counter-government headed by B√©la Mikl√≥s, the former commander of the Hungarian First Army. At the end of March 1945, Sz√°lasi's regime was driven out of Hungary.Stanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism, 1914-1945, Routledge, 1996, page 420  Dissolution  Under Soviet occupation, the fate of the Kingdom of Hungary was already determined. A High National Council was appointed as the country's collective Head of State until the monarchy was formally dissolved on 1 February 1946. The Regency was replaced by the Second Hungarian Republic. It was quickly followed by the creation of the Hungarian People's Republic.

It is based on the life of the Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani.  Plot  Set in Paris in 1919, this biopic presents the life of Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani, centering, artistically, on his relationship to and rivalry with Pablo Picasso when they both lived in Paris. Modigliani, an Italian Jew from Livorno, has fallen in love with Jeanne, a young and beautiful French Catholic girl. The couple has a child, and Jeanne's bigoted father sends the baby to a faraway convent to be raised by nuns. Modigliani is distraught but needs money to rescue and raise his child. Paris' annual art competition is in the offing. Prize money and a guaranteed career await the winner. Neither Modigliani nor his rival Picasso have ever entered the competition, believing that it is beneath true artists like themselves. But push comes to shove with the welfare of his child on the line, and the impoverished Modigliani signs up for the competition in a drunken and drug-induced act at the center of a caf√© frequented by artists, including Picasso, who is, by Modigliani signing the roster for the competition, himself induced to sign. All of Paris is aflutter with excitement at who will win. Modigliani tackles the work of his entry with the hopes of creating a masterpiece, and knows that all the artists of Paris are doing the same. Once completed, he calls his agent and dearest friend,L√©opold Zborowski, personally to take the painting to the competition and to make sure no one touches it. While his friend is taking the painting, Modigliani is at City Hall waiting to finally obtain a marriage license. City Hall closes before he is called, but he manages to persuade the woman clerk who is shooing him out to have mercy and give him the license anyway because he has a beautiful daughter and another on the way‚Äîand because he is an artist, as is she! As the last person to leave, he decides to celebrate with one drink. Unfortunately his addiction, and his nervousness about the competition, make him drink many more. The competition was going to start at eight o'clock, and when he realizes he is very late he finally rushes out, without paying. While drinking, he had been asked whether he had the money to pay, and he had answered that he had 5,000 francs (the prize money) and could buy everyone in the caf√© a drink. Two guys that were in the bar follow him and assault and severely beat him, under the assumption that he has a lot of money. Once they find that he has no money they leave him in the snow, bloody and more than half dead. His painting of Jeanne in a blue dress he had stolen from a shop window wins the competition, besting even Picasso's cubist portrait entitled Modigliani. Unaware of this victory, he somehow manages to make it home, where Jeanne washes the blood from his face. But then his artist friends come, realize that he needs to be in a hospital, and take him there over Jeanne's protests. He dies in hospital. Jeanne commits suicide by falling from a window. They are buried together, along with the unborn child.

Awards  Modigliani was nominated for two International Press Academy Golden Satellite Awards: to Pam Downe for Costume Design and Luigi Marchione and Vlad Vieru for Art Direction and Production Design. Historical errors The film contains many inaccuracies. Here are some of them: * The scene with the foreclosure (due to bankruptcy) with the furniture piled on the mother's bed, happened during Amedeo's birth (he was the last-born child). * Modigliani met Jeanne in 1917, not in 1919. * The alleged rivalry between him and Picasso has never been firmly proven. * The only real painting that appears in the final competition is Soutine's \\"Piece de Boeuf\\", realized later, in 1923; all the other works are fictional. * Modigliani was great friend not only with Utrillo but also with Soutine, Rivera, Kisling, Foujita, Br√¢ncu»ôi, Chagall, Souza Cardoso. * Modigliani was also a great sculptor. * Leopold Zborowski was not only an art dealer but also a poet and writer. * Modigliani and Jeanne dance in the streets to the notes of La vie en rose by Edith Piaf but the song was written in 1945. * Modigliani met Renoir around 1918, without the help of Picasso. * At the time Picasso was not a well established painter. * Picasso was left handed, while in the film he draws and writes with his right hand. * Modigliani died of meningitis not of tuberculosis (which he also suffered of), nor was he beaten up in the streets.

Prosecutors estimated that the gang ran an estimated 250,000 pounds of Colombian, Jamaican and Thai marijuana. Distribution reached into eleven Midwestern U.S. states and was valued at US$50 million to $100 million, then the largest known ring of its kind.  History  From their hometown of Indianapolis, Indiana, during 1975, Linda Leary (born April 15, 1931) and her two sons, Richard Heilbrunn (born June 20, 1951) and Paul Heilbrunn (born January 15, 1954), organized a drug smuggling ring that prosecutors called \\"The Yogurt Connection\\"--an allusion to the family's YoGo franchise and the French Connection drug trafficking scheme. Officially, they were selling Dr. Bronner's Natural Castile Soap through a health-food distribution business called Heilbrunn and Friends. Initially the \\"friends\\" were North Central High School graduates who set up marijuana sales networks at universities and eventually the wider market. In addition to their illegal activities, Linda and her sons maintained high profiles and excellent reputations in the community. Paul was a broker and financier. Linda was head of the Indianapolis League of Women Voters, president of the local chapter of the National Council of Jewish Women and a volunteer fund-raiser for the city's new zoo. They made highly visible loans to unknowing recipients, including a local radio station, a Cablevision franchise, and the Indianapolis Dining Guide. Few residents suspected that the same people who played tennis at the club and supported the government initiatives of then-mayor Richard Lugar, could also smuggle illegal drugs. According to the federal government‚Äôs indictment of the family, Paul organized the gang and saw to its growth. More businessman than drug dealer, Paul wore three-piece suits, drove a late-model BMW, frequented the most expensive restaurants and paid in hundred dollar bills. Paul had a reputation for being ruthless, which was evident in September 1975. According to federal prosecutors, Paul was supposed to talk to John Brady Jenkins, an employee and an old friend from North Central High School, about a large debt Jenkins owed the organization. Paul suspected trouble with Jenkins and, rather than meeting with John himself, Paul asked his brother Richard to take his place. Paul was correct; at the meeting, Jenkins pulled a pistol, killed Jerry Fitzgerald, a man who had accompanied Richard and put four bullets into Richard, leaving him for dead. Richard survived the wounds, though later he walked with a pronounced limp. Jenkins escaped and was eventually captured in a small Canadian town; he hanged himself in a British Columbia jail. According to hearsay, he committed suicide to put an end to threats made on a younger brother, intended to prevent Jenkins from turning government informant. A string of unsolved murders were attributed to the gang, including the 1976 death of Philip Winkler, the son of an Indianapolis oil company executive. None were ever prosecuted. In 1983, federal agents say they picked up a cocaine distributor who had been fired by Paul. In exchange for a grant of immunity, the man agreed to tell the authorities as much as he knew about the Heilbrunn operation. In the second half of 1985 Linda and her sons fled to Austria after learning a federal grand jury was looking into allegations the Heilbrunns were directing a multi-state smuggling operation. In November 1987, after four years spent gathering evidence, the authorities moved in on the Yogurt Connection with indictments against Leary, her sons and more than 30 other people. Leary and her sons were arrested in May 1989 in Austria. U.S. District Judge Larry J. McKinney sentenced Leary to nine years for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana. He sentenced her to a concurrent five-year term for racketeering. Convictions of Richard and Paul followed.

Sponsored by the National Biscuit Company (initially to promote their new Ritz Crackers), it aired for three full hours, starting at 10:30pm on the East Coast. This late-night timeslot gave the program a much larger audience on the West Coast when heard earlier in the evening. Let's Dance was a five-hour broadcast from New York, yet calculated so that all time zones heard three hours of music. The East Coast and Central Time zones got only the first three hours. Mountain Time zone listeners tuned into the second, third and fourth hours. Hours three, four and five were heard on the West Coast. The series premiered December 1, 1934, showcasing three different regular bands. The mellow music of Kel Murray (a pseudonym for Murray Kellner) and the Latin rhythms of Xavier Cugat made Benny Goodman's group stand out as \\"downright thrilling,\\" according to George Simon. It was a turning point for Goodman, who had more than 70 Fletcher Henderson swing arrangements by the time Let's Dance went off the air May 25, 1935. Despite its popularity, the program abruptly ended due to a labor dispute involving Nabisco employees, with the company temporarily discontinuing all of their sponsored radio shows as a result. However, because of the expense involved in sustaining Let's Dance, Nabisco decided not to renew the series for another season. George Spink, writing in the Chicago Sun-Times, described the crucial role of Let's Dance in launching Goodman as the \\"King of Swing\\": :Willard Alexander, who died in 1984, was the band's booking agent in 1935. He had placed his job on the line at the Music Corporation of America (MCA) by representing Goodman. In 1978, Alexander spent an afternoon with me at his New York office recalling the problems Goodman faced during the summer of 1935... In early 1935, Goodman and his struggling band had been one of three orchestras featured on NBC‚Äôs Saturday night Let‚Äôs Dance radio program. Xavier Cugat‚Äôs Latin orchestra and Kel Murray‚Äôs society orchestra dominated the first two \\"live\\" hours; Goodman was not heard until the last hour, late in the evening on the East Coast. :Other big bands such as Guy Lombardo‚Äôs and Glen Gray‚Äôs already enjoyed nationwide popularity. But they were patterned after the so-called hotel bands and played a pleasant, innocuous, \\"sweet style\\" of music... Between the end of the Let's Dance series in May 1935 and the band‚Äôs opening at the Congress, Benny Goodman and his orchestra suffered one defeat after another. In August, however, they scored a triumph at the Palomar in Los Angeles, a prelude of what was to happen at the Congress... The discouraged Goodman band opened August 21 for a three-week stay at the Palomar on Vermont and Third in Hollywood. Goodman started the evening cautiously, playing some stock arrangements he had purchased on the trip. The Palomar crowd seemed as indifferent to the band as the other audiences had been that summer. According to Alexander, Goodman's drummer, Gene Krupa, said, \\"If we're gonna die, Benny, let's die playing our own thing.\\" At the beginning of the next set, Goodman told the band to put aside the stock arrangements and called for charts by Fletcher Henderson and other \\"swing\\" arrangers who were writing for the band. When the band‚Äôs trumpeter, Bunny Berigan, played his solos on Henderson‚Äôs versions of \\"Sometimes I'm Happy\\" and \\"King Porter Stomp,\\" the Palomar dancers cheered like crazy and exploded with applause! They even gathered around the bandstand to listen to this new music. :Radio had made the difference. Earlier that year, the crowd at the Palomar had heard Goodman‚Äôs band on the Let's Dance program. The coastal time difference enabled West Coast listeners to hear Goodman beginning at 9pm, three hours earlier than listeners on the East Coast heard the show. And a West Coast disc jockey, Al Jarvis, had been playing Goodman‚Äôs recordings on his shows. The Palomar audience had been groomed for Benny Goodman and His Orchestra. Radio broadcasts from the Palomar sent the excitement from coast to coast--including Goodman's hometown, Chicago.

He is the lead singer of the R&B; group Silk. Born and raised in Nashville, Tennessee, he is the youngest of seven children. Musical career Gary began singing in church at the age of seven, which earned him a role as a featured soloist on BET's The Bobby Jones Gospel Show for many years. By the age of nine, Gary had mastered the guitar after only a few lessons and had self-taught an assortment of keyboards, drums and guitars. While attending Tennessee State University (TSU) in Nashville, Gary majored in music, with an emphasis in piano and voice. As a member of the prestigious TSU Jazz Collegians, he was selected to accompany Dizzy Gillespie on piano during Gillespie's visit to the school. He also appeared in several opera productions and performed with the Aristocrat of Bands, TSU's marching band program. In 1992, Gary answered an audition call and earned the role as lead singer for Keith Sweat's newly formed R&B; group Silk. Their career began with the success of \\"Freak Me\\" and \\"Lose Control\\" from Silk's 1992 debut album Lose Control. Their career spanned the globe for nearly ten years, with more than five million records sold. In September 1994, Jenkins appeared in the R&B; group, Black Men United and with his group Silk and mentor Keith Sweat on the single, \\"U Will Know\\" from the soundtrack to the movie, Jason's Lyric. The success of their second album, Silk, led to the follow-up, Tonight. Remaining consistent, they released their fourth album, Love Session in 2001. The group gained national recognition with his appearances on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Live with Regis and Kathi Lee, MTV, BET, Soul Train, Jenny Jones, Ricki Lake, Moesha, Showtime At The Apollo and Motown Live among others. Achieving international acclaim, Gary has toured throughout the world in such countries as Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom, Canada, Mexico, France, the Netherlands and Germany. With unresolved dissension among the group members mounting after the folding of their record label, Elektra, Gary resigned from the group in 2002. Over the following 18 months, Gary wrote, recorded and produced (with live instruments) his first independent solo project, The Other Side. Gary also studied theater in school, co-starring in Hello, Dolly! and Harvey. He made his professional debut in 1997 in the production of Sneaky.

His entire career was devoted to the areas of Naples and Lecce. Realino pursued a career in law and served in several municipal capacities before feeling called to the Jesuit life and being ordained to the priesthood in Naples. He is often dubbed as the \\"Apostle of Lecce\\" for his commitment to the poor and for his preaching abilities. Realino received beatification in 1896 from Pope Leo XIII while Pope Pius XII canonized him on 22 June 1947 as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church. Life Tomb of Saint Bernardino Realino in Lecce. Bernardino Realino was born in Carpi on 1 December 1530 to nobles. His father was a collaborator of Cardinal Cristoforo Madruzzo. He first attended school at Modena. Realino began his studies in philosophy and medicine in Bologna but altered this midcourse to law; it was said that a woman he fell in love with persuaded him to do so on the assumption that Realino would be good at practicing law. It also offered greater opportunities for advancement and wealth. He graduated with a doctorate in law ‚Äì both civil and canon law ‚Äì at the Bologna college in 1556. Through his family's influence, in 1556 he was appointed as the podest√† of both the Cassine and Felizzano cities ‚Äì he served as a judge in Felizzano. Realino was viewed as honest and became the praetor of Castelleone; he also worked as the chief tax collector in Alessandria. Realino became noted in these places for his legal brilliance and learning. He entered the service of Francesco Ferdinando d'Avalos and moved to Naples to act as the superintendent of the fiefs of the Marquis. In Naples a Jesuit preacher's sermon so moved him that he sought out the priest and had him hear his confession; the priest noted his inclination to the religious life and ‚Äì with some other Jesuit priests ‚Äì invited him in August 1564 to make a week-long spiritual retreat with them, to discern his call. He joined the Jesuits on 13 October 1564 (Alfonso Salmeron welcomed him into the order) and began his period of the novitiate. Realino was ordained to the priesthood on 24 May 1567; he made his vows in October 1566. Francis Borgia appointed Realino as the novice master at Naples. He was later sent to found a Jesuit house and college in Lecce in 1574. In 1583 he began a movement for diocesan priests to foster their virtues and to improve their moral-theological education to make them better confessors and preachers. Realino spent most of his life going from place to place preaching parish missions. He taught catechism and visited slaves on the galleys in the harbor at Naples.\\"Saint Bernardino Realino\\", Living Space In 1610 he suffered a fall and sustained two wounds that never healed. Not long before his death blood was taken from one leg wound and placed in glass vials; his health took a sharp decline in June 1616. Following his death in mid-1616 the relics of his blood which were kept were reported to have liquified. On his deathbed the Lecce magistrates asked him twice that he be the town's patron when he entered Heaven. Realino could not speak but nodded in approval and died whispering: \\"Ges√∫ ... Maria\\". The blood was liquefied until the mid-1800s though later instances were also reported. Roberto Bellarmino heard of his death and said: \\"I have never heard a complaint about Father Realino though I have been his provincial; even those who were ill-disposed to the society who seized every opportunity to speak unfavorably of it always made exception for Realino. ...Everyone knows that he is a saint\\". Sainthood Realino was proclaimed to be Venerable on 31 July 1838 after Pope Gregory XVI confirmed his life of heroic virtue. Pope Leo XIII beatified the Jesuit priest in Saint Peter's Basilica on 12 January 1896 (after the confirmation of two miracles attributed to him) and a decree for the resumption of the cause was issued on 1 May 1902; an informative process for two additional miracles was held and it received validation from the Congregation for Rites on 29 February 1940, while a preparatory committee approved them on 1 April 1941. Pope Pius XII later canonized him as a saint (after the confirmation of two more miracles) on 22 June 1947. Pius XII named him as the patron saint for Lecce on 15 December 1947. His remains are preserved in Lecce in the Chiesa del Ges√π. References Sources * Attwater, Donald and Catherine Rachel John. The Penguin Dictionary of Saints. 3rd edition.

A prequel, Sword Quest, was released January 22, 2008. A sequel, Sword Mountain, based on Sword Mountain, home of an eagle tribe mentioned in Sword Quest, was published in early 2012.  Plot  The story begins with Turnatt, an evil tyrant hawk and lord of Fortress Glooming, watching the construction of his fortress. Farther in the forest of Stone-Run are two tribes: the Bluewingle tribe of the blue jays and the Sunrise tribe of the cardinals, which are at war with each other, each accusing the other of stealing their eggs and food, not knowing that this is actually the work of Turnatt. A member of the Bluewingle tribe, a female blue jay named Aska, meets a robin named Miltin, a slave at Fortress Glooming, who warns her of Turnatt. Aska leaves and tells the two tribes of Turnatt. The groups make amends in time for the Bright Moon Festival, during which the Flying Willowleaf Theater arrive and help celebrate by telling the legend of Swordbird, a giant dove-like bird of peace with magical powers. The celebration is cut short when a group of Turnatt's soldiers attack, attempting to capture and enslave the two tribes and the members of the Flying Willowleaf Theater. The tribes manage to defeat the soldiers and decide to summon Swordbird, thinking that he is the only one with the power to defeat Turnatt, using his Leasorn Sword. The only problem is that Swordbird can only be sumonned by a song and one of the Leasorn Gems, which are said to be crystallized tears of the Great Spirit. There are only seven Leasorn Gems in the world, with an eighth one in Swordbird's blade. All hope seems lost until a recently escaped Miltin tells them that his tribe has one of the Leasorn Gems. The tribes decide to send Aska and Miltin over the White Cap Mountains to reach Miltin's home, the Waterthorn tribe. While Miltin and Aska are away, Turnatt sends his raven spy, Shadow, to destroy the two villages. Shadow and his group manage to set the Bluewingle tribe's home ablaze. The Bluewingle tribe take refuge with the Sunrise tribe. Shadow and his group attempt to light the Sunrise village on fire too, but are attacked by the tribe members and scattered. At the White Cap Mountains Aska and Miltin are attacked by a group of Slarkills and Miltin is mortally wounded and slowly dying. The two make it to the Waterthorn tribe where Miltin dies and Aska convinces the tribe to aid her tribes against Turnatt. The Winterhorn tribe arrives in time to help the Sunrise and Bluewingle tribes and the members of the Flying Willowleaf Theater in their battle against Turnatt and his attacking army. Aska manages to summon Swordbird, who quickly kills Turnatt. With their leader dead, Turnatt's army leave and the birds of Stone-Run release all those enslaved in Fortress Glooming. Two years later, Aska is married to Cody, an old friend of hers, the Sunrise and Bluewingle tribe have formed together as the Stone-Run Forest tribe, and Fortress Glooming has been made into the Stone-Run Library. The story ends with Cody and Aska visiting the grave of Miltin and leaving one of Swordbird's feathers. Awards and reviews  Swordbird, a New York Times bestseller, was nominated for the Book Sense Children's Picks List for spring 2007.www.swordbird - SWORDBIRD (2007) and SWORD QUEST (2008) The book has received mostly positive reviews. People magazine saying \\"Would be a standout even if it wasn't written by a 12-year- old.\\" Jane Friedman, President, CEO of HarperCollins said \\"Swordbird has an old-fashioned sense of values, which is what a lot of the great writers have.\\" And Mary Ann Fraser, of The Book Sense National Bestseller List said \\"Nancy Yi Fan introduces us to a bird world of discord, inhabited by warring cardinals and blue jays and accompanied by her own detailed line drawings (which were in fact drawn by Mark Zug). The goal is peace and freedom, and the vehicle is courage and friendship. A delightful debut!\\" However some critics pointed out lack of originality, a plot straight out of the Redwall series, stiff, hollow, and bland characters, and a villain that is annoying, rather than evil. Still others have complained about inaccuracies (e.g. the book claims cardinals are larger and stockier than blue jays, while blue jays are actually substantially bigger than cardinals,) and the fact that the hawk villain was male as well as being big and strong, while it's more likely that a female hawk, being larger, would qualify more easily as a villain.

It is located in the south of the county near Rathdowney on the main R435 regional road, on the River Erkina, a tributary of the Nore. Workhouse Donaghmore Workhouse Located on the road between Borris-in-Ossory and Rathdowney, Donaghmore Workhouse was opened in 1853 to house the most impoverished and desperate people in this part of County Laois. Conditions were made as unattractive as possible, so that only those who had ‚Äúlost all hope‚Äù would burden the taxpayer. Once inside, the inmates had to give up their personal clothing and don the rough workhouse uniforms. Families were split up; males from females, children from their parents. The inmates were divided into seven different categories, including one for elderly men and women, one for able-bodied males older than 13 years, one for able-bodied females older than 16 years, one for boys (7 to 13), one for girls 7 to 16, and one for children under 7. Once inside, the poor slept on mattresses of straw and rags; toilets were large tubs in the dormitories. Inmates worked during the day and then were fed. Meals were eaten in total silence. When Donaghmore Workhouse opened most of the poor of the County had already perished from starvation or had emigrated. The Workhouse was likely only full for a few years prior to its closure in 1886. The buildings were abandoned until 1920, when they were briefly used to billet a unit of Black and Tans during the Irish War of Independence. In 1927 it was used by the local agricultural cooperative for milk processing, eventually being acquired by the Glanbia food and marketing group. In 1988, Glanbia made some of the buildings available to a local committee for the purpose of developing a Famine and Agriculture museum. While local volunteers are the driving force behind the new museum, support has been received from the local development agency.

Completed in early 2003, the Schwartz Center provides a multidisciplinary teaching and performance center for the performing arts programs at Emory including dance, music, and theater. The centerpiece of the center is the 825-seat Cherry Logan Emerson Concert Hall featuring a custom- built Daniel Jaeckel Opus 45 pipe organ with fifty-four stops and 3,605 pipes in a cherry-wood case. The concert hall was designed in part by renowned acousticians Kirkegaard and Associates. The $36.9 million structure was designed by lead architect Michael Dennis in association with Howard- Montgomery-Steger and Smallwood, Reynolds, Stewart, Stewart. Design The Schwartz Center occupies a prominent site at the southwest corner of Emory's campus at the intersection of North Decatur Road and Clifton Road. The architectural style and exterior materials were chosen to echo existing buildings on campus. The nearby Goizueta Business School influenced the primary exterior finish which is a stucco accented by a Portuguese limestone known as cietra bella at the building's entrances. The architects studied venues including Boston's Symphony Hall and Vienna's Musikverein when designing the center. The Center's main hall is the 825-seat Cherry Logan Emerson Concert Hall, a tall, narrow shoebox concert hall design that rises above the roofline of the main building and is articulated with clerestory windows. Emerson Hall is in the southernmost section of the complex and its two-story lobby addresses North Decatur Road and the off-campus community beyond. The Center also houses two major teaching and performance spaces for theater and dance. The 109-seat dance studio has a Harlequin floor which is the only of its kind in Atlanta, and is the only space in Atlanta that is solely used for dance. The theater lab is a working space, it can be configured in many different ways depending on the performance, and at most seats approximately 70 people. There is also a theater observatory where students can view and discuss what is happening below in the theater lab. The Tharp Rehearsal Hall is used for major ensemble rehearsals, and is designed to mimic the breadth and height of a concert hall and stage so students can gain real performance experience. There are classrooms in the lower level of the Center known as \\"smart\\" classrooms. They are wired with equipment for multimedia and other presentations.

He served as Bishop of St. Augustine from 1940 until his death in 1967. He also held diplomatic posts in Europe and Asia. Early life and education Joseph Hurley was born in Cleveland, Ohio, one of nine children of Michael and Anna (n√©e Durkin) Hurley. His parents were both Irish immigrants; his father was originally from County Mayo, and his mother from Sligo. Hurley received his early education at Holy Name School from 1901 to 1909, and then attended St. Ignatius High School until 1912. He was the only one among his siblings to continue his education past age 16. He applied to West Point, for which he was nominated by U.S. Representative Robert J. Bulkley before it was discovered that Hurley was not an actual resident of Bulkley's 21st congressional district. Hurley attended John Carroll University in Cleveland from 1912 to 1915. At John Carroll, he was president of the College Debating Society and the speaker at the commencement ceremony. He also played football for the Geiger Clothes Company team, earning the nickname \\"The Breezer.\\" He began his studies for the priesthood at St. Bernard's Seminary in Rochester, New York, and was assigned to further theological studies at St. Mary's Seminary in his native Cleveland in 1917. During his summer vacations at St. Mary's, he worked as a naval observer in Sandusky. Priesthood On May 29, 1919, Hurley was ordained a priest by Bishop John Patrick Farrelly at the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist. His first assignment was as an assistant pastor at St. Columba's Church in Youngstown, where he remained for four years. In 1923, he received an interim assignment to St. Philomena's Church in East Cleveland. Later that year, he was appointed to Immaculate Conception Church in Cleveland. In 1927, Hurley accepted an offer to serve as secretary to Archbishop Edward Mooney, his former professor at St. Mary's Seminary and now Apostolic Delegate to India. He later accompanied Mooney to Japan when he was transferred to the Apostolic Delegation there in 1933. Following Mooney's return to the United States as Bishop of Rochester, Hurley served as charg√© d'affaires of the Apostolic Delegation in Japan from 1933 to 1934. During this period, he helped resolve a conflict that arose between Japan and Canada after the newspapers in Kagoshima accused Canadian Catholic missionaries of conducting spying operations on the fortified islands off Kagoshima Bay. Hurley was named a Domestic Prelate by Pope Pius XI in 1934. That same year, he became the first American to serve as an official of the Vatican Secretariat of State. During his work at the Secretariat of State, he acted as a liaison between the Holy See and the American Catholic hierarchy. He thus played an influential role in shaping the Vatican's policy towards Father Charles Coughlin, a controversial Michigan priest and radio personality. Episcopacy On August 16, 1940, Hurley was appointed the sixth Bishop of St. Augustine, Florida, by Pope Pius XII. It was believed by some that his appointment was made in order for him to remain in contact with the ailing Myron Charles Taylor, the American emissary to the Vatican. Others believed the appointment was a punishment; Hurley had become a critic of the wartime policy of the Vatican, believing Pope Pius XII was overly fearful about communism and not fearful enough about Nazism. He received his episcopal consecration on the following October 6 from Cardinal Luigi Maglione, with Archbishops Celso Costantini and Clemente Micara serving as co-consecrators, at the chapel of the Pontifical Urbaniana University in Rome. Returning to the United States, he was installed as Bishop of St. Augustine on November 26 of that year. The bishop was instrumental in building up the Diocese, which encompassed all of Florida at the time. Bishop Hurley, according to one retired priest, would fly around the state and locate property where the several new interstates were being planned. Hurley would buy up the properties to established church parishes for the future. His vision allowed the Catholic Church to grow rapidly throughout the years. Before the attack on Pearl Harbor, Hurley was considered the most outspoken interventionist among the American Catholic bishops. He made enemies among isolationist Catholic clergy and laity by labeling the Nazi Party \\"public enemy No. 1\\" of the United States and the Catholic Church. He declared, \\"The foe of all we love, both as Americans and as Catholics, is the Nazi. Communism is still our enemy but ... in point of urgency if not in point of teaching, communism has now ceded its primacy to national socialism.\\" In an editorial in his diocesan newspaper in 1943, he became the only Catholic bishop to issue a clarion call to Catholics to speak out against the extermination of the Jews taking place in the Nazi concentration camps, claiming that \\"the very basis of the Roman Catholic faith\\" compelled Catholics to challenge the \\"orgies of extermination\\" being perpetrated against the Jews. During World War II, Hurley aligned himself with the U.S. Department of State and began to act under the direction of government officials. His efforts were largely composed of black propaganda, the use of false source attributions. In a radio address in July 1941, he expressed his belief that President Franklin D. Roosevelt alone should decide upon U.S. entry into the war, saying, \\"It is up to him to safeguard the interests of the nation in times of great emergency. ...The problem [of entering the war] should be left to the Commander-in-Chief, who alone ... is capable of bringing us safely through.\\" These remarks drew sharp criticism from Archbishop Francis Beckman, who subsequently denounced the \\"dictatorship pseudo-officially canonized by a brother cleric.\\" Hurley described the Allied bombing of Rome as a \\"tragically mistaken decision,\\" and predicted that \\"much of our national unity, much of the respect we enjoy abroad now lie with San Lorenzo, in ruins.\\" He also opposed the idea that the United States should ally with Germany to oppose the Soviet Union. In 1945, in addition to his role as Bishop of St. Augustine, Hurley made a return to the papal diplomatic service and was appointed by Pius XII as regent ad interim to Yugoslavia. He thus became the first American to be raised to the equivalent rank of a nuncio. Relations between the Vatican and Yugoslavia had been deteriorating following the end of the war; the new communist government had been accused of murdering priests and the Church was charged with \\"obstructionist\\" activity. During his five years in Yugoslavia, Hurley negotiated with Marshal Josip Broz Tito and worked closely with U.S. officials. In 1946, he represented Pius XII at the show trial of Archbishop Aloysius Stepinac by Marshal Tito for \\"crimes against the people.\\" However, his relationship with Pius became strained after Hurley expressed his opposition to both the Vatican's policy towards Marshal Tito and to the removal of Archbishop Stepinac from his post in Croatia. In 1949, Hurley was relieved of his diplomatic post in Yugoslavia, and was given the personal title of Archbishop on August 14 of that year. Between 1962 and 1965, he attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council. Hurley became ill while attending the Synod of Bishops in Rome, and returned to Florida for treatment. After being nominated on July 1, 1966, he served on the St. Augustine Restoration and Preservation Commission, which would be renamed the Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board in 1970. He later died at Mercy Medical Center in Orlando, at age 73. Notes References *Gallagher, Charles R. 2008. Vatican Secret Diplomacy: Joseph P. Hurley and Pope Pius XII.

It also earned the group their first three Dove Awards for Group of the Year, Contemporary Black Gospel Album of the Year, and Contemporary Black Gospel Song of the Year. The album Take 6 is often mistakenly thought to be named do be doo wop bop, because that phrase appears on the album cover under the letters of the group's name.

Fortunately, an uninvited representative of Warner Bros, showed up who was impressed with a tape he had received of the group. \\"When I first played their tape,\\" Jim Ed Norman said, \\"I heard the most enchanting, wonderful sound in music coming from the human voice that I had heard in the longest time.\\" Warner Bros, signed Take 6 to a recording contract, and the album was released the following year on the company‚Äôs Reprise label.

He served as Bishop of St. Augustine from 1902 until his death in 1913. Bishop Kenny High School in Jacksonville is named for him. Biography William Kenny was born in Delhi, New York, to John and Ann (n√©e McDonough) Kenny. His youth was spent in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in newspaper work, and, when he had saved sufficient money to defray the expenses of his seminary education, he returned to New York and entered St. Bonaventure University near Olean. On January 15, 1879, he was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop John Moore for the Diocese of St. Augustine in Florida. After a short residence in Jacksonville, he was given charge of the mission in Palatka, where he remained for three years. In June 1884, Kenny was named pastor of the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Jacksonville. During his tenure as pastor, he became active in civic organizations and community service associations, and led relief efforts during the yellow fever outbreaks and Great Fire of 1901. He also became vicar general of the diocese in 1889. On March 25, 1902, Kenny was appointed the third Bishop of St. Augustine by Pope Leo XIII. He was the diocese's first bishop born in the United States. He received his episcopal consecration on May 18, 1902 from Cardinal James Gibbons, with Bishops Benjamin Joseph Keiley and Leo Michael Haid, O.S.B., serving as co-consecrators, in the Cathedral of St. Augustine. During his tenure as bishop, Kenny increased the recruitment of Irish priests and nuns, reorganized diocesan offices, expanded missionary efforts to Florida's interior and smaller towns, and more than doubled diocesan fundraising. He also established the first Catholic parish for African Americans in the state. On his way to attend the American Missionary Congress at Boston, Massachusetts, in October 1913, Kenny fell ill at Baltimore, Maryland, while visiting St. Mary's Seminary. He was removed to a hospital and there died at age 60.

Built in 1820, it was the birthplace and childhood home of Helen Keller (1880‚Äì1968), the famous deaf-blind author and speaker. A National Historic Landmark honoring Keller's life, it is now a museum open to the public. Description and history Ivy Green is located in a residential area north of downtown Tuscumbia, on the north side of West North Commons at Keller Lane. The property's principal features are the main house, the birthplace cottage, and the well. The main house is a 1-1/2 story frame structure with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. It has a five-bay facade, with sash windows around a roughly centered entrance. The entrance is sheltered by a gabled portico, and is framed by sidelight and transom windows. Nearby stands the birthplace cottage, a modest structure originally built as a plantation office, that was refurbished as a bridal suite for Arthur Henley Keller's second wife, who bore him Helen Keller in 1880. In between the two buildings stand the well and pump that played a key role in Helen Keller's development. The main house at Ivy Green was built in 1820 by David Keller, Helen Keller's grandfather. The well pump is where Helen Keller first achieved a communicated breakthrough with her teacher and companion, Anne Sullivan. and The property became a museum dedicated to Helen Keller in 1954. A fire in 1972 caused minor damage and resulted in the donation of additional materials by the Keller family. The Miracle Worker Every summer, for over 30 years, the Helen Keller Foundation has presented outdoor performances of William Gibson's The Miracle Worker. The play is usually performed from early June through mid- July. It is especially popular during the Helen Keller Festival held in Tuscumbia every June.

Groundwater models are used to simulate and predict aquifer conditions. Characteristics Fig. 1. Typical aquifer cross-section An unambiguous definition of \\"groundwater model\\" is difficult to give, but there are many common characteristics. A groundwater model may be a scale model or an electric model of a groundwater situation or aquifer. Groundwater models are used to represent the natural groundwater flow in the environment. Some groundwater models include (chemical) quality aspects of the groundwater. Such groundwater models try to predict the fate and movement of the chemical in natural, urban or hypothetical scenario. Groundwater models may be used to predict the effects of hydrological changes (like groundwater abstraction or irrigation developments) on the behavior of the aquifer and are often named groundwater simulation models. Also nowadays the groundwater models are used in various water management plans for urban areas. As the computations in mathematical groundwater models are based on groundwater flow equations, which are differential equations that can often be solved only by approximate methods using a numerical analysis, these models are also called mathematical, numerical, or computational groundwater models.Rushton, K.R., 2003, Groundwater Hydrology: Conceptual and Computational Models. John Wiley and Sons Ltd. The mathematical or the numerical models are usually based on the real physics the groundwater flow follows. These mathematical equations are solved using numerical codes such as MODFLOW, ParFlow, HydroGeoSphere, OpenGeoSys etc. Various types of numerical solutions like the finite difference method and the finite element method are discussed in the article on \\"Hydrogeology\\". Inputs For the calculations one needs inputs like: *hydrological inputs, *operational inputs, *external conditions: initial and boundary conditions, *(hydraulic) parameters. The model may have chemical components like water salinity, soil salinity and other quality indicators of water and soil, for which inputs may also be needed. Hydrological inputs The primary coupling between groundwater and hydrological inputs is the unsaturated zone or vadose zone. The soil acts to partition hydrological inputs such as rainfall or snowmelt into surface runoff, soil moisture, evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge. Flows through the unsaturated zone that couple surface water to soil moisture and groundwater can be upward or downward, depending upon the gradient of hydraulic head in the soil, can be modeled using the numerical solution of Richards' equation Richards, L. A. (1931), Capillary conduction of liquids through porous mediums, J. Appl. Phys., 1(5), 318‚Äì333. partial differential equation, or the ordinary differential equation Finite Water-Content method Ogden, F. L., W. Lai, R. C. Steinke, J. Zhu, C. A. Talbot, and J. L.

Lai, R. C. Steinke, and J. Zhu (2015), Validation of finite water- content vadose zone dynamics method using column experiments with a moving water table and applied surface flux, Water Resour. Res., 51,doi:10.1002/2014WR016454. Hydrological factors at the soil surface determining the recharge Operational inputs The operational inputs concern human interferences with the water management like irrigation, drainage, pumping from wells, watertable control, and the operation of retention or infiltration basins, which are often of an hydrological nature. These inputs may also vary in time and space. Many groundwater models are made for the purpose of assessing the effects hydraulic engineering measures. Fig. 2. Boundary conditions Boundary and initial conditions Boundary conditions can be related to levels of the water table, artesian pressures, and hydraulic head along the boundaries of the model on the one hand (the head conditions), or to groundwater inflows and outflows along the boundaries of the model on the other hand (the flow conditions). This may also include quality aspects of the water like salinity. The initial conditions refer to initial values of elements that may increase or decrease in the course of the time inside the model domain and they cover largely the same phenomena as the boundary conditions do. Fig. 3. Example of parameters of an irrigation cum groundwater model The initial and boundary conditions may vary from place to place. The boundary conditions may be kept either constant or be made variable in time. Parameters The parameters usually concern the geometry of and distances in the domain to be modelled and those physical properties of the aquifer that are more or less constant with time but that may be variable in space. Important parameters are the topography, thicknesses of soil / rock layers and their horizontal/vertical hydraulic conductivity (permeability for water), aquifer transmissivity and resistance, aquifer porosity and storage coefficient, as well as the capillarity of the unsaturated zone. For more details see the article on hydrogeology. Some parameters may be influenced by changes in the groundwater situation, like the thickness of a soil layer that may reduce when the water table drops and/the hydraulic pressure is reduced. This phenomenon is called subsidence. The thickness, in this case, is variable in time and not a parameter proper. Applicability The applicability of a groundwater model to a real situation depends on the accuracy of the input data and the parameters. Determination of these requires considerable study, like collection of hydrological data (rainfall, evapotranspiration, irrigation, drainage) and determination of the parameters mentioned before including pumping tests. As many parameters are quite variable in space, expert judgment is needed to arrive at representative values. The models can also be used for the if-then analysis: if the value of a parameter is A, then what is the result, and if the value of the parameter is B instead, what is the influence? This analysis may be sufficient to obtain a rough impression of the groundwater behavior, but it can also serve to do a sensitivity analysis to answer the question: which factors have a great influence and which have less influence. With such information one may direct the efforts of investigation more to the influential factors. When sufficient data have been assembled, it is possible to determine some of missing information by calibration. This implies that one assumes a range of values for the unknown or doubtful value of a certain parameter and one runs the model repeatedly while comparing results with known corresponding data. For example, if salinity figures of the groundwater are available and the value of hydraulic conductivity is uncertain, one assumes a range of conductivities and the selects that value of conductivity as \\"true\\" that yields salinity results close to the observed values, meaning that the groundwater flow as governed by the hydraulic conductivity is in agreement with the salinity conditions. This procedure is similar to the measurement of the flow in a river or canal by letting very saline water of a known salt concentration drip into the channel and measuring the resulting salt concentration downstream. Dimensions Groundwater models can be one-dimensional, two-dimensional, three-dimensional and semi-three-dimensional. Two and three-dimensional models can take into account the anisotropy of the aquifer with respect to the hydraulic conductivity, i.e. this property may vary in different directions.  One-, two- and three-dimensional #One-dimensional models can be used for the vertical flow in a system of parallel horizontal layers. #Two-dimensional models apply to a vertical plane while it is assumed that the groundwater conditions repeat themselves in other parallel vertical planes (Fig. 4).

The corresponding EnDrain model can be downloaded from: are examples of two-dimensional groundwater models. #Three-dimensional models like Modflow Online guide to MODFLOW-2000 and MODFLOW-2005 require discretization of the entire flow domain. To that end the flow region must be subdivided into smaller elements (or cells), in both horizontal and vertical sense. Within each cell the parameters are maintained constant, but they may vary between the cells (Fig. 5). Using numerical solutions of groundwater flow equations, the flow of groundwater may be found as horizontal, vertical and, more often, as intermediate. Semi three-dimensional In semi 3-dimensional models the horizontal flow is described by 2-dimensional flow equations (i. e. in horizontal x and y direction). Vertical flows (in z-direction) are described (a) with a 1-dimensional flow equation, or (b) derived from a water balance of horizontal flows converting the excess of horizontally incoming over the horizontally outgoing groundwater into vertical flow under the assumption that water is incompressible. There are two classes of semi 3-dimensional models: *Continuous models or radial models consisting of 2 dimensional submodels in vertical radial planes intersecting each other in one single axis. The flow pattern is repeated in each vertical plane fanning out from the central axis. *Discretized models or prismatic models consisting of submodels formed by vertical blocks or prisms for the horizontal flow combined with one or more methods of superposition of the vertical flow. Continuous radial model Een example of a non-discretized radial model is the description of groundwater flow moving radially towards a deep well in a network of wells from which water is abstracted.Subsurface drainage by (tube)wells: well spacing equations for fully and partially penetrating wells in uniform or layered aquifers with or without anisotropy and entrance resistance.

On line: have a grid over the land surface only. The 2-dimensional grid network consists of triangles, squares, rectangles or polygons (Fig. 7). Hence, the flow domain is subdivided into vertical blocks or prisms (Fig. 3). The prisms can be discretized into horizontal layers with different characteristics that may also vary between the prisms. The groundwater flow between neighboring prisms is calculated using 2-dimensional horizontal groundwater flow equations. Vertical flows are found by applying one-dimensional flow equations in a vertical sense, or they can be derived from the water balance: excess of horizontal inflow over horizontal outflow (or vice versa) is translated into vertical flow, as demonstrated in the article Hydrology (agriculture). In semi 3-dimensional models, intermediate flow between horizontal and vertical is not modelled like in truly 3-dimensional models. Yet, like the truly 3-dimensional models, such models do permit the introduction of horizontal and vertical subsurface drainage systems (Fig. 3). Semiconfined aquifers with a slowly permeable layer overlying the aquifer (the aquitard) can be included in the model by simulating vertical flow through it under influence of an overpressure in the aquifer proper relative to the level of the watertable inside or above the aquitard.

Career Ayleward served at organist at Norwich Cathedral (illustrated 1723) During the English Restoration, Ayleward was appointed organist and choirmaster of Norwich Cathedral. He held office there from 1661-1664, and again from 1666-1669, working under the director of music Christopher Gibbons, the son of Orlando Gibbons. During the Interregnum Ayleward no doubt did much writing of choral pieces, possibly for private home performance, as, to mark the coronation of Charles II, he produced twenty-five anthems, all showing highly original composition. During the year 1664‚Äì1665, Ayleward gave up his position at Norwich, and he appears to have been away at \\"the assizes\\". There is no indication of what caused this \\"call\\". However, he was reappointed in 1665 and remained at his position until his death in 1669. His compositions are unusual in that they call for three or four solo voices in the same range, in some cases, and they required massive resources for full performance. They were extensively scored works for many, many performers, and greater personnel than Norwich may have possessed in its regular choir. All the manuscripts of his compositions were owned by Norwich Cathedral, and these were purchased by A. H. Mann and published.

More correctly known as the \\"Additional Act to the Constitutions of the Empire\\" the document extensively amended (in fact virtually replacing) the previous Napoleonic Constitutions (Constitution of the Year VIII, Constitution of the Year X and Constitution of the Year XII). The Additional Act reframed the Napoleonic constitution into something more along the lines of the Bourbon Restoration Charter of 1814 of Louis XVIII, while otherwise ignoring the Bourbon charter's existence. It was very liberal in spirit, and gave the French people rights which had previously been unknown to them, such as the right to elect the mayor in communes of less than 5,000 in population. Napoleon treated it as a mere continuation of the previous constitutions, and it therefore took the form of an ordinary legislative act \\"additional to the constitutions of the Empire\\". Preparation Napoleon, having returned from the Island of Elba for the Hundred Days, was not able to re-establish the First Empire as it had been before his restoration. He asked the liberal Benjamin Constant to prepare a new Constitution. It was adopted by a plebiscite on June 1, 1815 by an immense majority of the five million voters, although a great many eligible voters abstained. It was promulgated in the Champ de Mai ceremony at the Champ de Mars. The rapid fall of Napoleon prevented it from being fully applied. Principles The legislative power was to be exercised by the Emperor together with the Parliament, which was to be composed of two chambers: the Chamber of Peers composed of hereditary members appointed by the Emperor, and the Chamber of Representatives, composed of 629 citizens elected for 5 year terms by electoral colleges in the individual d√©partments. The ministers were to be responsible to the Parliament for their actions. The liberalization dealt both with the guarantees of rights and the end of censorship. In the end, the two chambers held sessions for only one month, from June 3 to July 7, 1815. See also *Charter of 1814 References *English Text of the Charter *Anderson, Frank Maloy.

The office, located in a trailer, travels from race to race. The office serves as the workplace for NASCAR officials including president Mike Helton, vice president for competition Scott Miller and Monster Energy Cup series director Richard Buck.  Overview  The term is taken from the better-known Oval Office, the office used by the President of the United States, and the oval shape of the 2004 Nextel Cup Series logo which is prominently displayed on the side of the trailer. The term was first used by Mike Joy in 2004 during the Subway 400 at the North Carolina Speedway, after Mark Martin and Pat Tryson were summoned after allegations that Martin was blocking Kasey Kahne late in the race in order to protect his teammate, Matt Kenseth. Prior to that time, the command station had been known as the \\"Big Red Truck\\" for the Cup events or the \\"Big Blue Truck\\" for the Busch Series, because of the colors of the series' sponsors (Winston and Busch, respectively). NASCAR has since standardized their logos, so now the term can refer to the shape of the logos of any NASCAR series. The Oval Office is the venue for meetings, usually just after a race (but sometimes during a race), where drivers and crew chiefs who have run afoul of NASCAR rules are brought in for consultation or notification of penalties. A driver who is in trouble for some sort of altercation, either on or off the track, is often quoted as saying that they have been \\"called into the Oval Office\\". Traditionally, the races at Bristol Motor Speedway are the ones where it is said the \\"line is busy\\" when numerous drivers and crew chiefs, and even general mechanics and spouses (Eva Busch and Nicole Biffle at the Samsung 500 in one instance), are requested to appear following fouls that take place during or after the race, including fights. Commentator Larry McReynolds often refers to a \\"pardon from the Oval Office\\" when a driver receives a free pass (or \\"lucky dog\\"), which allows the first driver who is a lap or more behind the leaders to move up a lap when a caution flag comes out.

It is usually available as the salt detomidine hydrochloride. It is a prescription medication available to veterinarians sold under the trade name Dormosedan. Currently, detomidine is only licensed for use in horses. Properties Detomidine is a sedative with analgesic properties. Œ±2-adrenergic agonists produce dose-dependent sedative and analgesic effects, mediated by activation of Œ±2 catecholamine receptors, thus inducing a negative feedback response, reducing production of excitatory neurotransmitters. Due to inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system, detomidine also has cardiac and respiratory effects and an antidiuretic action. Effects A profound lethargy and characteristic lowering of the head with reduced sensitivity to environmental stimuli (sound, pain, etc.) are seen with detomidine. A short period of reduced coordination is characteristically followed by immobility and a firm stance with front legs spread. Following administration there is an initial increase in blood pressure, followed by bradycardia and second degree atrioventricular block (this is not pathologic in horses). The horse commonly sweats to excess, especially on the flanks and neck. Other side effects reported include pilo erection (hair standing erect), ataxia, salivation, slight muscle tremors, and (rarely) penile prolapse. Uses Sedation and anaesthetic premedication in horses and other large animals, commonly combined with butorphanol for increased analgesia and depth of sedation. In conjunction with ketamine it may also be used for intravenous anaesthesia of short duration. The drug is normally administered by the intravenous route, and is fastest and most efficient when given intravenously . However, in recalcitrant animals, detomidine may be administered by the intramuscular or sublingual routes. The dose range advised by the manufacturers is 20‚Äì40 ¬µg/kg intravenous for moderate sedation, but this dose may need to be higher if given intramuscularly. When given intravenously, detomidine usually takes effect in 2‚Äì5 minutes, and recovery is full within 30‚Äì60 minutes. However, this is highly dependent upon the dosage, environment, and the individual animal; some horses are highly resistant to sedation. Cautions As detomidine is an arrhythmogenic agent, extreme care should be exercised in horses with cardiac disease, and in the concurrent administration of other arrhythmogenics. The concurrent use of potentiated sulfonamide antibiotics is considered particularly dangerous. Detomidine is a poor premedication when using ketamine as an anesthetic in horses. Anesthetic recoveries in horses that have received ketamine following a detomidine premedication are often violent with the horse having multiple failures to stand resulting in trauma to itself. Xylazine is a superior premedication with ketamine resulting in safer recoveries.

He caught on with the Kansas City Athletics in 1955. Brunet received his first call up to the majors in 1956, giving up seven earned runs in nine innings pitched. His second Major League appearance came against the Boston Red Sox with the bases loaded, and Ted Williams standing in the batter's box. Brunet got Williams to bounce into a double play. He spent the next three seasons in the minors, making brief call ups in 1957 and 1959. Brunet was 14‚Äì15 with a 3.42 ERA and a league leading 235 strikeouts for the Little Rock Travelers in 1957. At one point, his record stood at 10‚Äì3, but over a stretch of over fifty innings in which his team failed to give him a single run of support, his record fell to 10‚Äì11. One of the two games Brunet appeared in in 1959 was against the Chicago White Sox on April 22. He entered in the seventh inning with the bases loaded, and five runs already scored due to poor pitching and even worse fielding (five walks and three errors). Brunet walked the first two batters he faced, hit the next batter, then walked three more before Jim Landis grounded back to the mound. The Chisox scored eleven runs that inning on just one hit. Brunet finally made it onto an Athletics opening day roster in 1960, but was traded to the Milwaukee Braves a month into the season for Bob Giggie. Milwaukee Braves The Braves originally assigned Brunet to the Louisville Colonels upon acquiring him, but he was quickly called up after going 4‚Äì1 with a 0.78 earned run average. Brunet went 2‚Äì0 with a 5.07 ERA in seventeen games (six starts) in his first season with the Braves. He again started 1961 in the majors, but was sidelined by an appendectomy after just one appearance. Brunet made four appearances when he returned that June, but was reassigned to the triple A Vancouver Mounties by the end of the month, and remained there for the rest of the season. On May 16, 1962, he was traded to the Houston Colt .45's for minor league pitcher Ben Johnson. Houston Colt .45's Brunet was terrible in his first two starts with Houston. He lasted a total of one inning, and was charged with six earned runs. He settled in for his next start, pitching a complete game against the Chicago Cubs in which he gave up just one unearned run. He ended up going 2‚Äì4 with a 4.66 ERA in eleven starts. He also made six appearances out of the bullpen. The 1963 Baltimore Orioles were in the American League pennant race. Following Dean Stone's retirement, they had only one left hander in their bullpen, Pete Burnside. They purchased Brunet's contract from Houston on July 14, 1963, and in his third appearance with the Baltimore Orioles, he earned his first career save. He began the 1964 season assigned to the Orioles' triple A affiliate, the Rochester Red Wings, then was reacquired by the Colts on May 12. He was 10‚Äì6 with a 3.00 ERA for the Colts' triple A affiliate, the Oklahoma City 89ers, when his contract was again sold on August 18. This time to the Los Angeles Angels. Angels After eleven seasons of bouncing around, Brunet seemed to have finally found a home in Los Angeles. He was immediately promoted to the Major Leagues upon his acquisition by the Angels. He went 2‚Äì2 with a 3.61 ERA, mostly as a starting pitcher. One of those victories came on September 5 against his former club, the Orioles. He held the Orioles to four hits over seven innings before handing the ball over to Bob Lee for the save. The 1‚Äì0 victory knocked the Orioles out of first place. Probably his finest season in the majors was 1965, when Brunet went 9‚Äì11 with a 2.56 ERA splitting fourth starter duties for the newly renamed California Angels with Rudy May. The .209 batting average he held opposing batters to was the fourth lowest in the league. By 1967, he was the Angels' top starter, but was a victim of hard luck. After a complete game victory in the season opener, Brunet lost his next nine decisions, a span during which the Angels only scored eighteen runs. In 1967 and 1968, he led the AL in losses with 19 and 17, respectively, despite relatively modest ERAs both seasons (3.31 and 2.86, respectively). He pitched back-to-back shutouts to earn his last two wins with the Angels on July 9 and July 14, 1969. On July 31, his contract was sold to the Seattle Pilots. Brunet's career with the Angels spanned over six seasons, his longest tenure with any club. Ball Four Brunet went 2‚Äì5 with a 5.37 ERA for the Pilots in their only season in existence, however, he earns mention in Jim Bouton's account of the Seattle Pilots, Ball Four. Upon learning that the Pilots acquired Brunet, Bouton wrote, \\"The Pilots have just bought George Brunet from the Angels for something just over the waiver price. He'll fit right in on this ballclub. He's crazy.\\" The depth of his craziness is later revealed when Bouton discovers that Brunet doesn't wear underwear. He explains, \\"This way I don't have to worry about losing them.\\" Shortly after the Pilots moved to Milwaukee and renamed themselves the Brewers, Brunet was traded to the Washington Senators for Dave Baldwin. He went 8‚Äì6 with a 4.42 ERA For the Senators before a trade deadline deal brought him to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Denny Riddleberger. After finishing out the season in Pittsburgh, he and Matty Alou were traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for Nelson Briles and Vic Davalillo. He appeared in seven games for the Cards before he was released. He caught on with the San Diego Padres shortly afterwards, and went 18‚Äì13 with a 4.02 ERA in two seasons with the Hawaii Islanders. While with Hawaii, he received an offer to pitch in Japan, but declined, waiting on a call from the Minnesota Twins which never materialized. He spent one last season with the Philadelphia Phillies' Pacific Coast League affiliate, the Eugene Emeralds before retiring. Brunet's minor league totals are 112 wins against 115 losses. He holds the minor league record for strikeouts with 3,175. Mexico Nicknamed \\"Lefty\\" and \\"Red\\" during his Major League career, he was known as \\"El Viejo\\" or \\"The Old Man\\" in Mexico as he pitched well into his fifties. His first stop in Mexico was Poza Rica, with Petroleros de Poza Rica. At 42 years old, on June 20, 1977, he pitched a no-hitter. He pitched for them through 1978, going 62‚Äì55 with a 2.55 ERA and actually spending part of the 1977 season as manager. He split the 1979 season between the expansion Blue Coatzacoalcos and the Diablos Rojos del M√©xico. He was traded to Rojos del √Åguila de Veracruz before the start of the 1980 season, however, he returned to Blue Coatzacoalcos during the baseball strike that interrupted play for two weeks (Coatzacoalcos was one of six teams to play through the strike). He returned to Veracruz after the strike. On June 10, 1984, he set the Mexican record for shutouts with 55. Brunet pitched until he was 54 years old, giving him a record 36 years of pitching in organized baseball. On October 25, 1991, Brunet died of a heart attack in Poza Rica, Veracruz, Mexico at the age of 56. In 1999, he was elected to the Mexican Baseball Hall of Fame.

The term \\"unobtrusive measures\\" was first coined by Webb, Campbell, Schwartz, & Sechrest in a 1966 book titled Unobtrusive Measures: nonreactive research in the social sciences.Webb, Eugene J. et al. Unobtrusive Measures: nonreactive research in the social sciences. Chicago: Rand McNally, 1966 The authors described methodologies which do not involve direct elicitation of data from the research subjects. Unobtrusive measures are contrasted with interviews and questionnaires, in that they try to find indirect ways to obtain the necessary data. The unobtrusive approach often seeks unusual data sources, such as garbage, graffiti and obituaries, as well as more conventional ones such as published statistics. Unobtrusive measures should not be perceived as an alternative to more reactive methods such as interviews, surveys and experiments, but rather as an additional tool in the tool chest of the social researcher. Unobtrusive measures can assist in tackling known biases such as selection bias and experimenter's bias. Webb and his colleagues emphasize the importance of triangulating the results obtained through various methodologies, each with its own unique set of (usually unknown) biases. The proliferation of digital media opened a new era for communication researchers in search of unobtrusively obtained data sources. Online communication creates digital footprints that can allow an analysis of data that are obtained through unobtrusive methods, and are also massively larger than any corpora obtained via elicitation and human transcription. These footprints can now be used to analyze topics such as the content of communication events, the process of communication, and the structure of the communicative network. The surge of Internet-sourced research data rekindled the discussion of the ethical aspects of using unobtrusively obtained data. For example, can all data collected in the public domain be used for research purposes? When should we seek consent, and is it realistic to require informed consent from sources of unobtrusively collected data? These questions do not have a simple answer, and the solution is a result of a careful and ongoing dialog between researchers, and between researchers and society. References * Lee, R. M. (2000).

When lane sharing is done for the purpose of passing slow or stopped congested traffic, it is called filtering forward. When lane sharing is done by using space between lines of traffic, it is called lane splitting.  Examples of lane sharing  # A right turning driver moves towards the curb in a wide lane to share the remainder of the lane to his left with overtaking through traffic. # Two motorcyclists riding side-by-side in a lane. # A dozen cyclists riding in a bunch, or peloton, within a lane. # A farm tractor driver moving over partially into a shoulder to leave room in the lane for overtaking traffic. # A cyclist or motorcyclist riding in the unused space surrounding the lane stripe to overtake stopped traffic (filtering forward). # A bicyclist riding in the shoulder side of a lane to allow faster traffic to pass on the inward side.

Based out of Oskaloosa, Iowa, Musco is responsible for lighting a full range of sports facilities, from Daytona International Speedway and Emirates Stadium, to thousands of Little League fields worldwide. In addition to lighting both Mount Rushmore National Memorial and the Statue of Liberty, it also provides lighting systems for large industrial areas, such as DP World Jebel Ali Port Terminal 1 and Georgia Ports Authority's Garden City Terminal. Musco has also won an Academy Award and an Emmy Award.Musco stadium lighting installation  History  Musco Lighting was founded by Joe Crookham, a lawyer, and Myron Gordin, an engineer. Together in 1968 they founded a startup business venture named G&L; Industries which manufactured products that were sold under their customer's brand names. In 1976, Joe and Myron purchased the Muscatine Lighting and Manufacturing Company in Muscatine, Iowa, which marked the start of Musco Lighting. A year later in 1977, the company released the Sports Cluster¬Æ system. This development featured fixtures that were mounted on metal cross arms, rather than the standard wooden ones, simplifying installation and improving reliability. By 1979, through research and development, the company introduced factory luminaire aiming, as well as the remote ballast, simplifying maintenance by placing the electrical components in a service box near the base of the pole.  1980s  Musco would enter the movie industry in 1983, when they provided lighting for All the Right Moves, a Tom Cruise film. Musco continued to light large sporting events, including the 1983 Super Bowl, followed by the 1984 Olympic Games taking place in Los Angeles. They also marketed small baseball parks across the US by designing a four-pole light system for Little League fields. The second half of the 1980s consisted of Musco lighting the rededication ceremony for the Statue of Liberty, providing on-screen lighting for the film \\"Field of Dreams\\" and several others, and introducing several new products including SportsCluster-2¬Æ, Level-8‚Ñ¢, and Total Light Control‚Ñ¢ (TLC).  1990s  In 1992, Musco was contracted to light the first Little League World Series to be played at night at Lamade Stadium. After this World Series, the company would go on to becoming the Official Sports-Lighting System of Little League Baseball and partner to create A Safety Awareness Program‚Ñ¢ (ASAP) to improve safety in Little League. Musco moved into a new area of sports lighting by developing Mirtran‚Ñ¢ (ground level mirror lighting technology) to meet the criteria for lighting NASCAR tracks. Charlotte Motor Speedway was the first to receive this new technology in 1992 for \\"one hot night\\", a part of the 1992 Winston Cup. This design would be used at the Daytona International Speedway. Musco made their first major lighting installation in Europe by implementing its lighting system at Dunstall Park, in England. The final year of the decade saw a major innovation in regards to facility management with Control-Link, a wireless control system based on internet technologies that provides facility managers the ability to control their sports-lighting remotely.  2000s  Musco expanded in 2002 both internationally and domestically, by opening production facilities in China and South Korea, and by placing regionally based lighting technicians to service customers in the US, respectively. In 2005, Musco introduced Musco's Light-Structure Green‚Ñ¢ system and the Musco Constant 25‚Ñ¢, a 25-year warranty and maintenance program. The White House was Musco's first outdoor application with the technology. Additionally, in 2008 Musco brought light to the Losail International Circuit, one of the world's largest lighting projects, along with the Yas Marina Circuit in 2009.  2010s  In 2010, Musco engaged one of its largest projects, lighting the East Span of the San Francisco Bay Bridge. After three years of development and testing, the design had 51,500 LEDs in 1,600 light fixtures strategically aimed to highlight the bridge without shining light in the eyes of the 300,000 daily drivers. The new LED system reduced energy consumption by 50 percent as compared to the typical metal halide lighting. In 2013, Musco installed LED lights at Arizona State University's Wells Fargo Arena, the first in NCAA basketball. The following year, Emerson, Georgia LakePoint Sporting Community installed Musco's Light- Structure Green‚Ñ¢ LED system, being the first major sports complex to do so. Musco also installed its system at NRG Stadium, making it one of the first NFL stadiums to be lit with LED technology, and at Twickenham Stadium, one of the first in Europe, for the Rugby World Cup being held in England.

It was reported by Aleksei Chichibabin in 1914. The following is the overall form of the general reaction: :Chichibabin overall reaction The direct amination of pyridine with sodium amide takes place in liquid ammonia. Following the addition elimination mechanism first a nucleophilic NH2‚àí is added while a hydride (H‚àí) is leaving. Ciganek describes an example of an intramolecular Chichibabin reaction in which a nitrile group on a fused ring is the source of nitrogen in amination.  Mechanism  :532x532px It is widely accepted that the Chichibabin reaction mechanism is an addition- elimination reaction that proceeds through an œÉ-adduct (Meisenheimer adduct) intermediate (the third structure). First, the nucleophilic NH2‚àí group adds to the Œ¥+ ring carbon pushing electrons onto the ring nitrogen and forming the anionic œÉ-adduct, which is stabilized by sodium. Electrons from the nitrogen are then pushed towards the ring forming a C=N bond and ejecting a hydride ion. The hydride ion abstracts a hydrogen from the positively charged nitrogen, forming hydrogen gas. The ring nitrogen then pushes electrons back into the ring, regaining aromaticity, the now negatively charged NH group abstracts a proton from water giving the product. Reaction progress can be measured by the formation of hydrogen gas and red color from œÉ-adduct formation. Sodium amide is a handy reagent for the Chichibabin reaction but handling it can be dangerous and caution is advised. * œÉ-adduct (Meisenheimer adduct) formation Evidence indicates that before addition of the amino group, the ring nitrogen is sorbed onto the surface of sodium amide and the sodium cation forms a coordination complex. This increases the Œ¥+ on the Œ±-carbon, thus 1,2-addition of sodium amide is favored over 1,4-addition. The proximity of the amino group to the Œ±-carbon once the coordination complex is formed also makes the 1,2-addition more likely to occur. Some data exists that supports a single electron transfer as the proposed pathway for œÉ-adduct formation. In most cases, the anionic œÉ-adduct is unstable making its formation the rate determining step. * Hydride ion elimination In addition to the mechanism shown above, other pathways have been proposed for the elimination step. The mechanism above, loss of the hydride ion followed by abstraction of a proton, is supported by the fact that the nucleophile needs at least one hydrogen atom for the reaction to proceed. Another competing pathway could be the elimination of hydride by sodium to form sodium hydride.  Factors influencing reaction  Different aromatic nitrogen heterocyclic compounds proceed through the Chichibabin reaction in a matter of minutes and others can take hours. Factors that influence the reaction rate include: * Basicity - The ideal pKa range is 5-8 and the reaction either does not proceed, or proceeds poorly outside of this range. The reaction occurs faster under more basic conditions but only up to a point because when electron density builds up on the Œ±-carbon, it makes it less electrophilic. The strongest base known to aminate is 4-dimethylaminopyridine (pKa 9.37). * Œ¥+ on Œ±-carbon - For kinetically controlled additions, the rate of amination is related to the magnitude of the partial positive charge on the carbon next to the ring nitrogen. For thermodynamically controlled additions, the rate of amination is related to the stability of the œÉ-adduct. * Ease of hydride elimination - Success of this reaction is also dependent on the ease at which the hydride ion leaves and the ring regains aromaticity. The rate of amination for three azoles proceeds quickest to slowest as follows: 1-methylbenzimidazole > 1-methylnaphth-[2,3-d]imidazole > 3-methylnaphth[1,2-d]imidazole. Since the addition of the amide ion proceeds quickly with these substrates, the differences in reaction rates is most likely their propensity for hydride elimination and reformation of an aromatic ring. * Substituents - Electron-withdrawing groups inhibit the Chichibabin reaction. Three proposed ideas of why this is are (1) they decrease the basicity of the ring nitrogen and slow down the sorption on sodium amide, (2) these electron-withdrawing groups can also form complexes with sodium amide, and (3) for single electron transfer pathway, altering the distribution of spin density of the intermediate radical anion. Substrates with œÉ-dimethoxy groups don't aminate because they form a stable complex with sodium amide. Electron-donating groups also inhibit the Chichibabin reaction because of their deactivating effects. * Benzo annelation - Since the hydride ion is a poor leaving group, benzo annelation increases reactivity of the substrate in the Chichibabin reaction. This is demonstrated by the fact that 1-methylimidazole does not work as a substrate, but 1-methylbenzimidazole reacts easily. * Solvent - The ability of the polar anionic œÉ-adduct to form will depend on the solvating capacity and the dielectric constant of the solvent. * Temperature - The rule of thumb in aprotic solvents (where œÉ-adduct formation is the rate determining step) is to run the reaction at the lowest temperature for good hydrogen evolution to avoid the decomposition that occurs at high temperatures.  Side reaction  Dimerization is a side reaction that can occur. When heated in xylene and sodium amide at atmospheric pressure, the substrate 4-tert-butylpyridine produces 89% of the dimer product (4,4'-di- tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine) and only 11% of the aminated Chichibabin product (2-amino-4-tert-butylpyridine). When subjected to 350 psi nitrogen pressure and the same conditions, the yields are 74% of the aminated Chichibabin product and 26% of the dimer product.

At in length, it is the largest of the golden mole species. The mole has dark, glossy brown fur; the name golden comes from the Greek word for green-gold, the family Chrysochloridae name.  Characteristics  The giant golden mole has a subterranean lifestyle. It has large claws, powerful fore limbs, no external tail or ears, wedge-shaped head, leather pad, and skin covering the eyes. It is approximately 208-235 millimetres in length and 410-500 grams in weight. With dark and brown skin on the upper parts and faded on the underparts, the hair is longer and coarser than any other species of golden mole: thick, with dense, woolly underfur.  Biology  The largest, rarest, and most endangered of all 17 species of golden moles, the giant golden mole spends most of its time underground and is blind and deaf. It is nocturnal, hunting mostly at night, but also in some cool and cloudy daytime conditions. It is solitary; it does not form groups, despite some social behavior such as hibernating in others' burrows among the roots of trees in winter, only moving slightly to keep its body temperature in range and twitching to maintain body temperature while sleeping. Female Giant Golden moles give birth to one or two offspring at a time while it has stocks of food supply.  Diet  The giant golden mole digs semi-permanent tunnels for hunting food and may feed on the surface hiding in the leaf litter. It eats mainly millipedes and giant earthworms, but also crickets, cockroaches, grasshoppers, worms, and snails.The giant golden mole is endemic to South Africa  Habitat  The giant golden mole is a subterranean small mammal, living in chambers and passages underneath a very specific habitat, forest with soft soils, deep leaf litter layers and well-developed undergrowth. The giant golden mole is endemic to South Africa, mostly in a restricted area in the Eastern Cape.  Population   Status  The giant golden mole was classified as Endangered (EN) in 2010 on IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The population is decreasing due to habitat loss resulting mainly from human activities affecting its habitat such as firewood collection, bark stripping, cutting for construction, overgrazing of livestock, and clearance of forest. Moreover, the giant golden mole is preyed on by domestic dogs in that area.  Conservation  Nowadays, the giant golden mole receives little protection, and is not a main conservation target. Research is needed to protect this species and to assess the status and viability of the remaining populations.

She was later canonised a saint by the Roman Catholic Church. Life Early life She was born Anna Francesca Boscardin at Brendola, Veneto. In her family and town she was known as Annette.Sicari, Antonio, Ritratti Di Santi She was a member of a peasant family. Her father, Angelo Boscardin, would testify during her beatification process that he was jealous, violent, and frequently drunk. As a child she could only attend school irregularly, as she was needed to help at home and in the fields. When she did attend school she also worked as a servant in a nearby home. She did not display any particular talents, was thought to be not particularly intelligent, and was often the target of insulting jokes. These included being referred to as a \\"goose\\" for her slowness by a local clergyman.St. Patrick Catholic Church: Saint of the Day, October 20 She was allowed to make her First Holy Communion at eight and a half years old, when the authorized age in those years was eleven. At twelve years old, she was accepted into the parish association of the ‚ÄúChildren of Mary‚Äù association. The parish priest gave her a catechism as a gift. They found it in the pocket of her habit, when she died, at 34 years old. Vicenza After being rejected for admission to one order because of her slowness, she was accepted as a member of the Teachers of Saint Dorothy, Daughters of the Sacred Heart at Vicenza in 1904, taking the name \\"Maria Bertilla\\". She herself internalized some of her earlier criticism, telling the novice-mistress of the order, \\"I can't do anything. I'm a poor thing, a goose. Teach me. I want to be a saint.\\" She worked there as a kitchen maid and laundress for three years. Treviso She was then sent to Treviso to learn nursing at the municipal hospital there, which was under the direction of her order. During her training period, she was once placed to work in the kitchen. However, upon completing her training, she was promoted to working with victims of diphtheria in the hospital's children's ward. During the air raids of Treviso following the disastrous Battle of Caporetto, the hospital fell under the control of the military. Sister Bertilla was noted for her unwavering care of her patients, particularly those who were too ill to be moved to safety.Foley OFM, Leonard, \\"St. Maria Bertilla Boscardin\\", Saint of the Day:Lives, Lessons, and Feast, (revised by Pat McCloskey OFM), Franciscan Media This devotion to duty attracted the attention of the authorities of a local military hospital. However, her superioress did not appreciate Sister Bertilla's work and reassigned her to work in the laundry, a position she remained in for four months until being reassigned by a higher superior, who put Sister Bertilla in charge of the children's isolation ward at the hospital. Shortly thereafter, Sister Bertilla's already poor health got worse. A painful tumor which she had had for several years had progressed to the point of requiring an operation, which she did not survive. She died in 1922. Veneration Her reputation for simplicity and devoted, caring hard work had left a deep impression on those who knew her. A memorial plaque placed on her tomb refers to her as \\"a chosen soul of heroic goodness ... an angelic alleviator of human suffering in this place.\\" Crowds flocked to her first grave at Treviso. After a tomb was erected for her at Vicenza, it became a pilgrimage site where several miracles of healing were said to have taken place. In 1961, 39 years after her death, she was canonised as a saint. The crowd in attendance included members of her family as well as some of her patients. Her feast day is October 20.

Chambers published in the collection The King in Yellow in 1895. The story is an example of Chambers' horror fiction, and is one of the stories in the collection which contains the motif of the King in Yellow. Plot summary The story follows an unnamed narrator who visits the Church of St. Barnab√©. As he makes himself comfortable, he is encountered by an unknown fear which he manages to dismiss at the sight of the solemnity and beauty of the church. He begins to listen to the organ, whose tones anger him with their bombastic nature. Nobody else appears to notice. He then sees the organ-player leave and is calmed. However, as he looks around and sees that \\"the same man was coming out from behind the organ, and was passing along the gallery the same way\\", he is at first brought out of balance but puts this down to a mistake at having reckoned the passed time. But as this organ-player leaves for the second time, he looks on the narrator with a look of unimaginable hatred which the narrator sees. Initially fearful of the organ-player's malign intent, the narrator chides himself over his own foolish notions and then exits the church. Whilst venturing home the organ-player is encountered several times along the way, filling the narrator with dread. As he gets closer to home (the Rue du Dragon) he calms himself but then sees the organ player going against him. He struggles to escape but realizes it is futile. At the last moment he awakens at the church and thinks it all a dream yet then resolves that he knew him all along, saying: \\"For I knew him now. Death and the awful abode of lost souls, whither my weakness long ago had sent him ‚Äî they had changed him for every other eye, but not for mine\\". Then the church disappears and seemingly the narrator now stands on the shore of the Lake of Hali. Then death seemingly comes: \\"And now I heard his voice, rising, swelling, thundering through the flaring light, and as I fell, the radiance increasing, increasing, poured over me in waves of flame. Then I sank into the depths, and I heard the King in Yellow whispering to my soul: 'It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God!'\\". Major themes This story is one of the most mysterious in the collection. While we know that there is a connection between the organ-player and the narrator, we do not know what it is, or what caused the \\"weakness\\" that had \\"sent him\\" to the \\"awful abode of lost souls.\\" The words of the King--\\"It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.\\"-- is a quote from the Bible (Hebrews 10:31), from a passage dealing with punishment for sin.

It won the 2007 Silver Award at WorldFest Houston in the category of Best Science Fiction/Fantasy/Horror Film. The film starred Trevor Duke as Derek Cowley, and Kimberly J. Brown as Samantha Marche. It was rated R in the United States for strong violence, gore, language, and nudity. Plot Two men are hunting in the jungle of Cameroon when one from another group of two people calls and says that his guide is missing. Then one can hear on the radio that someone is being attacked by what sounds like a wild animal. A human-like creature rips the leg off of one of the men. The man's brother, Charlie Crowley finds his brother dying. Years later, Charlie's nephew Derek has been living with emotional abuse from Mitch Toblat after Mitch married his mother. In spite of this Derek is going up to his stepfather's cabin with his friend Samantha and his four other friends while Mitch is on a business trip. After spending five hours searching for the cabin, they finally find it. That night the cabin is attacked by, to their surprise, a werewolf, and they are more surprised to find that it talks. The werewolf kills two of Derek's friends and breaks into one of the locked rooms of the cabin where it rapes one of the girls in front of her boyfriend, before killing her. The werewolf then castrates the boyfriend and kills him too. Derek and Sam both manage to escape the werewolf and are found by police. They tell the police they didn't get a good look at what attacked them, knowing that they wouldn't believe them. The next day Mitch picks Derek up from the police station, and tells Derek that the deaths of his friends are on him for taking his friends to the cabin in the first place. Sam and Derek both suspect that Mitch is the werewolf. Later Charlie pays Derek a visit to see if he's alright. Derek and Sam confide what they know to Charlie, who surprisingly believes them. Charlie explains that he shot at the werewolf that killed his brother and suspected it to be Mitch as Mitch had a crush on Derek's mother. Charlie also says they just can't accuse Mitch, and need DNA evidence to be compared to the hair sample he got from the werewolf. Meanwhile, Charlie reconnects with Derek's mother while Derek and Sam become romantically connected themselves. While searching for DNA evidence, Sam enters Mitch's room and picks hair from his comb. Mitch catches Sam in his room and forces her to perform oral sex on him, and Sam takes the semen sample as DNA. Derek finds out and it puts a strain on her and Derek's relationship. Meanwhile, Mitch has been stalking Charlie, suspecting that he is sweet on his wife. Mitch picks up a package addressed to Charlie, and learns it is DNA results. Mitch later abducts Charlie and reveals to him that he doesn't need the moon to change, that he learned to control himself to the extent that he can transform at will. Mitch beats, tortures, mutilates and finally kills Charlie, saying it is his own fault for not minding his business. Derek later finds the DNA report and learns that Mitch has killed Charlie, Derek confronts Mitch about it. Mitch tries to justify himself but Derek shoots down his arguments. Around the same time, Derek's mother decides to leave Mitch. In retaliation, Mitch kidnaps Sam and demands Derek to meet him in the cabin that night, alone. Derek arrives, but another group of teenagers go to the cabin to investigate the previous massacre (a running gag in the film). Mitch transforms and kills them one at a time, including raping a girl in their group. When it is down to Derek and Sam, they fight Mitch with silver knives and arrows. Eventually, they set Mitch on fire and the cabin burns down. After escaping the fire, Derek and Sam embrace, but Mitch is not dead and bites Derek, before being stabbed one last time. As he dies, Mitch says \\"my curse is now yours\\". Derek worries about his future after all he went through, but Sam promises to stick by him whatever happens, and they drive off together on her moped. After the credits end, Mitch is shown moving his fingers slightly. Cast * Trevor Duke as Derek Cowley * Kimberly J.

It involves repeating information over and over in order to get the information processed and stored as a memory.Goldstein, B. (2011). Cognitive Psychology: Connecting Mind, Research, and Everyday Experience--with coglab manual. (3rd ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth. Types Maintenance rehearsal Maintenance rehearsal is a type of memory rehearsal that is useful in maintaining information in short term memory or working memory. Because this usually involves repeating information without thinking about its meaning or connecting it to other information, the information is not usually transferred to long term memory. An example of maintenance rehearsal would be repeating a phone number mentally, or aloud until the number is entered into the phone to make the call. The number is held in working memory long enough to make the call, but never transferred to long term memory. An hour, or even five minutes after the call, the phone number will no longer be remembered. In 1972, Craik and Lockhart proposed that memory recall involves multiple processes operating at different levels. Maintenance rehearsal involves repeatedly processing an item at the same level (Baddeley, 2009), which requires little attention. It has the potential for immediate recall, but has little effect in recall in long term memory (Greene, 1987). Depending on the information that needs to be processed determines which route of recall an individual will use. For example, if the information only needs to be used temporarily, a person will use maintenance rehearsal in working memory. But, if the information needs to be used at a later date, most likely a person will use elaborative rehearsal. In elaborative rehearsal, the information is processed at a deeper level and has the ability to move to long-term memory. In a literature review, researchers proposed a hypothesis that, ‚ÄúInformation entering working memory from the visual external world is processed by structures in the parietal and temporal lobes specialized for perceptual processing (Jondies, Lacey & Nee, 2005). Maintenance rehearsal has the potential to assist in long-term memory in certain situations. In a previous study, researchers looked at the difference in recall for a set of words between participants who knew they were going to be asked to recall the words, in which they repeated the words multiple times and the participants who did not know they were going to recall the words, in which they only repeated the words once. The group that were told they would have to recall the words at a later date, did significantly better than those who were not told they would have to recall (Baddeley, 2009). There is also a positive correlation between the meaningfulness of words and how much an individual will remember them (Baddeley, 2009). The more meaning an individual associates with a certain word or a list of words, the more likely and easier it will be for them to remember them if asked to repeat them at a later date. There can be differences in which younger and older children rehearse. Dempster (1981), reports that in younger children, they tend to only rehearse one item at a time. This helps them be able to remember the item without the clutter of other items. The developmental age of the child could also play a role in the number a child is able to remember and rehearse. The older a child is, the more items they can rehearse at once (Dempster, 1981). In many ways, maintenance rehearsal is useful, such as when people look at a phone number and need to replicate it in a few seconds. But for information that needs more attention and better processing, maintenance rehearsal is only a temporary fix. Individuals should use other processing techniques and elaborative rehearsal to help move information from working to long-term memory. Working memory is commonly cited as more of a process than an actual storage and is critical to the ability to maintain and manipulate information in one's mind. Because of its importance to cognition, working memory is responsible for that novel information that has immediate importance, but is not needed so much that it is committed to permanent storage in long term memory. In this way, it exists somewhere in an area somewhere between short-term and long-term memory. The phonological loop is a concept implicated in maintenance rehearsal and is very much a function of working memory. It is composed of two parts: a short- term store, and an articulatory rehearsal process that both work to constantly refresh subvocal memorization. The capacity of the phonological loop is not large, only being able to hold around seven items, but is very dependent on subvocal rehearsal to refresh the memory traces of those items so that they temporarily stay in storage. Similarly, subvocal rehearsal is dependent upon the short-term store in that it is where the information for the phonological loop is found. In this way, both processes of the phonological loop directly rely on one another to complete the process. In regard to learning theory, the phonological loop has been found to be especially effective when visual information is paired with auditory information. For instance, if one were to read a set of information and listen to it being read audibly, they are more likely to remember it than if they were to simply read it without the audio to supplement it. In this way, it is true that the maintenance rehearsal is most beneficial with rote memorization, however it can be used as a tool for learning particularly when paired with other modes. Elaborative rehearsal Elaborative rehearsal is a type of memory rehearsal that is useful in transferring information into long term memory. This type of rehearsal is effective because it involves thinking about the meaning of the information and connecting it to other information already stored in memory. It goes much deeper than maintenance rehearsal. According to the levels-of- processing effect by Fergus I. M. Craik and Robert S. Lockhart in 1972, this type of rehearsal works best because of this depth of processing. In addition to processing novel information in which the meaning behind the information is enough to transfer it to long term memory, another way that elaborative rehearsal works is by associating new information with information that is already held in long term memory. This approach requires the learner to engage with new information in a way that creates meaningful connections to previously-learned things, thus leading to the new information also being committed to long term memory. An effective way of encouraging elaborative rehearsal is by engaging with the material in more than one way. For instance, discussion or study groups provide an opportunity to make discrete pieces of information more personal by attaching stories to them and creating meaningful connections to things already learned. Elaborative rehearsal has strong support in learning, especially in its attention to meaningful connections across different concepts and pieces of information. More specifically, elaborative rehearsal is extremely beneficial when remembering larger pieces of information such as sentences or other larger chunks. Baddeley's model In the Baddeley's model of working memory, this ability comprises a central executive and two buffers ‚Äì the phonological loop and the visuospatial sketch pad. Both storage buffers are characterized by passive storage and rehearsal information. This rehearsal function has been associated with frontal networks such as the Broca's area.Garon, N., Bryson, S. and Smith, I. (2008). Executive Function in Preschoolers: A Review Using an Integrative Framework. More specifically, subvocal rehearsal and verbal maintenance are associated with the posterior left precentral gyrus. The temporary storage of the phonological loop is often attributed to the supramarginal gyrus in the parietal lobe.

Ice Spiders stars Patrick Muldoon, Vanessa Estelle Williams, Noah Bastian, K. Danor Gerald and Matt Whittaker and was released on DVD in 2007.  Plot  Dan \\"Dash\\" Dashiell (Patrick Muldoon) is a retired Olympic skier who works at a ski resort in the mountains of Utah. On a restricted side of the mountain, Dr. April Sommers (Vanessa Estelle Williams) is working on creating a new breed of spider with several others. When a group of teen skiers arrives at the mountain, Chad (Noah Bastian) challenges Dash to a race. The two show some impressive moves as the others look on. When Dash reaches a large rocky slope, he turns back and goes down another way rather than risk a leg injury like the one that ruined his career. As Dash makes it to the bottom, he meets Dr. Sommers. While they talk for a while, Frank (Stephen J. Cannell) takes the teens inside the resort. After a brief discussion, Dr. Sommers returns to the lab, where she finds dead scientists everywhere. She finds the sole survivor cocooned in a spider web. He warns Dr. Sommers about the spiders escaping and then slowly dies. When she turns to leave, the last spider remaining at the lab, a mutated Black Widow, attacks her and forces her into a locked office. She finds an alarm and engages it, which alerts Professor Marks (David Millbern) and Army Captain Baker (Thomas Calabro), who are elsewhere on the mountain, to her location. Meanwhile, back at the lodge, Dash meets up with Ranger Rick (a pun on the children's nature magazine) who asks Dash to assist him in finding two hunters who did not return to their homes. When they find the hunters' truck parked, they dismount their snowmobiles and take a look around. Dash finds a mutilated Elk and thinks it was killed by a bear. He shoots a flare to summon Rick. When Rick arrives, they find the body of one of the hunters. When they reach a huge spider web, they find the other hunter, cocooned in the web. As they turn to run, Rick is snagged by a web and is dragged to a spider that kills him as Dash watches in horror. Dash makes it back to the hunters' truck and hot-wires it to get away. Back at the lab, Professor Marks, Captain Baker, and a squad of soldiers enter the compound and find Dr. Sommers, who tries to warn them of the danger. Inside the lab, the spider attacks and kills a soldier. Dr. Sommers steals records of the experiment and realizes Professor Marks deliberately accelerated the spiders' growth, which makes them larger, faster, and stronger; however, it also causes them great hunger and prevents the cold from killing them. Sommers was desperate to obtain sufficient amounts spider webbing for new armor ideas. She drives back to the lodge. When Dr. Sommers meets up with Frank and Johnny, a man comes in and screams for help. Frank and Dr. Sommers watch as the spiders kill several guests, including the teens' ski coach. Frank sees the teens hiding in a shed, leads them to a bus and gets them safely inside. Chad gets the keys and drives off, crashing the bus into a snow bank and causing it to fly off of the road. Dash returns to the hotel and helps secure it. When he and Dr. Sommers search the basement, a spider gets in and almost attacks them, but they stun it with a fire extinguisher and lock it in the basement. Back in the lobby, a spider crawls in through the chimney and kills two guests before Dash impales it with the antlers of a mounted deer head. Meanwhile, on the crashed bus, after checking the area, Frank makes sure the kids are okay. However, one of them is unconscious and injured. They think of a way to get out as the black widow tries to get in. Eventually, Franks traps the spider and the kids escape. Frank is almost killed but is rescued thanks to the timely arrival of Captain Baker and his squad. Back at the lodge, Dash devises a plan with Captain Baker over a radio to trap the spiders. He takes his skis and leads the spiders to a snowboard half-pipe, which Baker and his men are blocking off. Johnny heads toward an avalanche cannon and waits for Dash's signal. At the half-pipe, the spiders are captured and Dash signals Johnny, who blows the spiders up. Professor Marks, who had been opposed to killing the spiders, charges at Dash and tries to kill him. Marks falls down the side of the half-pipe to the last spider, which kills him as Baker shoots the beast. A government agent then arrives with a group of soldiers that begin destroying all traces of the spiders. The agent demands that the survivors keep quiet about recent events and says that the \\"official\\" (that is, cover-up) explanation for what happened will be that there was a spill of hallucinogenic chemicals.

SR 669 was commissioned in 1937, along much of the same route as today. The highway was extended to its current western terminus in 1938. The entire route was paved by the mid-1950s. Route description SR 669 begins at a T-intersection with SR 13, southeast of Somerset. The highway heads towards the east passing through farmland and woodland, as a two-lane highway. The highway has a T-intersection with SR 345, SR 669 heads northeast concurrent with SR 345\\\\. The road passes through residential area, before SR 669 leaves SR 345\\\\. SR 669 heads towards the southeast passes through woodland, as a two-lane highway. The route enters Crooksville, passing through residential properties. The highway has an intersection with SR 93, SR 669 turns south concurrent with SR 93\\\\. The concurrency head towards south- southeast, as a four-lane divided highway, before becoming a two-lane highway. The highway passes through woodland and crosses over a railroad track. The concurrency ends at an intersection with SR 669 turning towards the east and SR 93 continuing towards the south. The highway heads east through woodland, with some farmland and houses. SR 669 begins a concurrency with SR 555, heading towards the north-northeast. The concurrency ends with SR 669 heading towards the east and SR 555 continuing towards the north. SR 669 heads east- southeast through woodland as a two-lane highway. The highway makes a sharp turn on the banks of the Muskingum River. The road parallels the river on the west banks of the river, until the road enter Malta. In Malta the highway makes a sharp curve towards the southwest, followed by a curve towards the southeast. The road continues towards the southeast, passing through residential properties in Malta. SR 669 ends at an intersection with SR 37 and SR 78. History SR 669 was commissioned in 1937, on the same route as today between Crooksville and Malta. In 1938 the route was extended west to its current western terminus, replacing SR 663. The first section of route paved was between Crooksville and Deavertown, which was paved in 1942. The final section was paved between 1957 and 1959, this section was between SR 555 and Eagleport.

They were devised by Hannah More and intended for sale or distribution to literate poor people, as an alternative to what she regarded as the immoral traditional broadside ballad and chapbook publications. The tracts proved to be enormously successful with more than two million copies sold or distributed during the first year of the scheme. Background During the early 1790s there was widespread concern about the possibility of a popular uprising in Britain following the French Revolution, and the radical ideas which were circulating in popular publications. The English religious writer and philanthropist Hannah More referred to the ‚Äòcorrupt and vicious little books and ballads which have been hung out of windows in the most alluring forms or hawked through town and country.‚ÄôCheap Repository (1795) Following the commercial success of her Village Politics (1792), which was a rebuttal of Thomas Paine's Rights of Man, she decided that an entire series might be undertaken to provide 'religious and useful knowledge, as an antidote to the poison continually flowing thro‚Äô the channel of vulgar and licentious publications. These, by their cheapness, as well as by their being, unhappily, congenial to a depraved taste, obtain a mischievous popularity among the lower ranks.A plan for establishing a repository of cheap publications, (1795). She, drew up her plan for publishing such works in the West Country during 1794 and circulated it among her friends who encouraged her to extend it to cover the whole country and to appoint London distributors. A committee to form the Cheap Repository for Moral and Religious Tracts was established with Henry Thornton as Treasurer. A printed prospectus was issued listing eighteen titles,Cheap Repository (1795) to secure subscriptions to underwrite the project. The new tracts were intended to point out the pitfalls of drunkenness, debauchery, idleness, gambling, riotous assembly, and seeking to rise above one's station, whilst simultaneously praising the virtues of honesty, industry, thrift, patience and an acceptance of one's pre-ordained place in society, by means of simple ballads and short instructive tales. They were published as either octavo chapbooks or else as broadside ballads, emulating the traditional forms of Street literature. Approximately one third of them were designated as ‚ÄòSunday Reading‚Äô and contained simplified Bible stories or else a more specifically religious message.Stoker, (2013), p.97. Authorship More than half of the official series of tracts were written by Hannah MoreG. H. Spinney, (1939‚Äì40), pp. 295‚Äì340. A further six were perhaps written by her sister Sarah, others by evangelical friends such as the poet William Mason, the philanthropists and campaigners against slavery Zachary Macaulay, John Newton, and Henry Thornton, or else William Gilpin, the artist and writer on the picturesque. A few titles were condensed versions of existing well-known works, such as Isaac Watts‚Äô, Divine Songs or Daniel Defoe‚Äôs The History of the Plague in London in 1665, or else retellings of Bible stories.Jones, (1952), p.138. The scheme was subsidised by subscriptions from supporters enabling the publications to be sold at below cost price. Publication Divine Songs ... for children - the seventh Cheap Repository Tract to be issued, printed at Bath by Samuel Hazard in March 1795 The individual tracts have a complex bibliographical history often going through many editions and involving several different individuals who were designated 'Printer to the Cheap Repository,' together with many distributors and publishers. Retail sales were made by 'booksellers, newsmen, and hawkers, in town and country.'This statement appears on the majority of the tracts. The most important printers involved were Samuel Hazard of Bath; John Marshall of London, William Watson of Dublin; and John Evans of 42 Long Lane, London. Several copies were also reprinted in the U.S.A. by printers in both New York and Philadelphia. Until the end of 1798 the publisher undertaking the work was 'The Cheap Repository', but thereafter the copyrights of the official tracts were sold and later collected editions were published by John and James Rivington (publishers) for the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (S.P.C.K.) Hazard Series (March‚ÄìMay 1795) Under More‚Äôs initial scheme the tracts were all to be printed by Samuel Hazard, of Cheap Street Bath and distributed by him and by John Marshall in London and by Richard White in Westminster.Stoker, (2013), p.102. Publication commenced in March 1795 and in the first six weeks (March 3 ‚Äì April 18, 1795) the Bath Chronicle reported that 300,000 copies were sold wholesale and the presses hardly able to keep pace with orders arriving from all parts of the country.Fawcett (2008) p.63. By July of the same year, the number sold had more than doubled;Altick, (1957), p. 75. According to the ‚ÄòAdvertisement‚Äô prefacing one of the collected editions of the tracts: Many persons exerted their influence, not only by circulating the tracts in their own families, in schools, and among their dependants, but also by encouraging booksellers to supply themselves with them; by inspecting retailers and hawkers, to whom they gave a few in the first instance, and afterwards directed them in the purchase; also by recommending the tracts to the occupiers of stalls at fairs, and by sending them to hospitals, workhouses, and prisons. They were also liberally distributed among soldiers and sailors, through the influence of their commanders. Cheap repository shorter tracts, (1798). Hazard/Marshall Series (May 1795-January 1796) The Carpenter, 1795 in the format of a broadside ballad. Both Hazard and Marshall are described as 'Printer to the Cheap Repository' By the end of April 1795 it was apparent that Hazard would be unable to cope with the demand for new titles and for reprints from his limited business in Bath and so after the twenty-third tract issued in May 1795 John Marshall (who operated a far more substantial printing and publishing business at 4 Aldermary Churchyard, London) was recruited to become a joint ‚ÄòPrinter to the Cheap Repository‚Äô.Stoker, (2013), p.103. The next twenty-six or twenty-seven tracts were therefore issued simultaneously in editions printed in London and in Bath.Spinney, (1939), p.322-3. The discrepancy is because one title The middle way is the best appears to have been withdrawn after printing. Marshall also began to reprint editions of the earlier tracts. The tracts were still selling well by December 1795 but there continued to be distribution problems particularly in those parts of the United Kingdom more remote from London (notably Scotland and the north of England). Hannah More also began to realise that the cost of producing simultaneous editions at two different centres in England was not sustainable in the long term, and she was hearing complaints about the low level of discounts offered to the hawkers who were expected to distribute many of the copies. At the same time she was receiving requests from the wealthier supporters of the scheme for an edition printed on better quality paper in the more compact duodecimo format which might be bound into annual collected volumes.Stoker, (2013), p.103-4. As a result, the publication scheme was re- organised in January 1796, and a new prospectus issued.Cheap Repository for Moral and Religious Publications, (1796). The Shepherd of Salisbury Plain, one of the most popular tracts. Only Marshall is now described as ‚ÄòPrinter to the Cheap Repository‚Äô Marshall Official Series (February 1796-December 1797) Following the re-organisation, John Marshall became the sole printer of the tracts with Samuel Hazard demoted to the role of a distributor. William Watson also was appointed as ‚ÄúPrinter to the Cheap Repository‚Äù in Dublin and permitted to reprint the existing titles once they had been issued in London. An additional distributor, John Elder, of North Bridge, Edinburgh, was appointed to cover Scotland and Northern England. A further sixty five new titles were printed and published by John Marshall between February 1796 and December 1797 in the two chapbook formats but the broadside ballad editions were gradually phased out, and the existing ballads were re-issued in small booklets containing three or four titles. Annual collected editions of the tracts were also published for the years 1795 and 1796. However, as the scheme progressed through 1796 and 1797 Hannah More found it increasingly difficult to find authors for new tracts and relations with her publisher began to deteriorate leading her decision to reduce the rather of publication to three tracts each quarter after December 1797.Stoker, (2013), p.105-7. John Marshall had by this time devoted virtually the whole of his business to the production and distribution of the tracts and their cessation would have been a financial disaster to him. He was on the point of issuing a third collected volume of the tracts in November 1797 when he quarrelled with More over the ownership of copyrights. This led to his refusal to continue as printer and the main distributor of the tracts, and the appointment of John Evans in his place.Stoker, (2017), p.320-3. ‚Äô‚ÄôThe contented cobler‚Äô‚Äô (1798) one of John Marshall‚Äôs 'unofficial' series of tracts. Marshall's 'Unofficial' Series (January 1798-December 1799) Marshall felt aggrieved by his treatment by Hannah More and as an experienced publisher of ballads and chapbooks he had no difficulty in securing further suitable texts to continue the series. He therefore issued a further seventy-three 'unofficial' Cheap Repository tracts on his own over the next two years whilst he reorganised his business.Stoker (2013), pp.111-6. These were similar in format, and general appearance to the official series, often using the same woodcuts, but contained only his name as printer and distributor. They did not always adhere to the same high moral tone of the official series were sometimes a little racier in content.Jones (1952), p.143. The official body warned potential purchasers about the status of Marshall's tracts and surviving copies sometimes have the words 'Cheap Repository' obliterated from the title page.Stoker (2017), pp.321. However, the different series are often confused with one another. In some examples of the Dublin tracts an official tract was paired with one of Marshall's unofficial tracts.Stoker (2020), pp.359. Marshall ceased publishing his series in December 1799. Watson Dublin Series (1796-1800) In March 1795 authorised the Association for the Discountenancing of Vice and Promoting the Knowledge and Practice of Religion and Virtue, in Dublin, (of which she was an honorary member) to reprint her tracts in Ireland.Stoker (2020), 347-9. This was undertaken by William Watson, Secretary to the Association, and a printer and bookseller of 7 Capel Street Dublin. He wbecame‚ÄòPrinter to the Cheap Repository‚Äô in Ireland.Mary Pollard, Dictionary of members of the Dublin book trade 1550-1800, London: Bibliographical Society, 2000, pp.595-6. Most of the Irish tracts were reprints of the English equivalents although a few were amended to suit the Irish situation and given new titles. There are also a few tracts that were only issued in Ireland. They were also printed more compactly than the English equivalents and so in many cases two of the English titles were combined in a 24-page chapbook.Stoker (2020), 351. William Watson continued to re-issue tracts until his death in 1805, when he was succeeded by his son, also named William Watson (d.1818). He was succeeded by his widow, Ann Watson, who continued to issue the tracts well into the 1820s.Pollard, 2000, pp.596.Further reprints were issued by A. & W. Watson until the early 1830s.ref>Stoker (2020), 362-4. The Black Prince, printed by John Evans in 1798. Evans Official Series (1798-1800) After the resignation of Marshall in December 1797, a further fifteen new titles in the official Cheap Repository Tracts series, written by Hannah More were printed by John Evans. These were issued between December 1797 and October 1798, starting with The fall of Adam, which contained an announcement of the new publishing arrangements.‚ÄùStoker, (2017), p.321-3. The new series includes at least one tract, commenting on the Irish Rebellion of 1798, which does not later appear in Hannah More's collected works.Stoker (2015) These do not appear to have had the same impact as the earlier series of tracts. Nevertheless, reprints of the original individual titles continued to be printed by John Evans and his successors. These included, J. Evans & Co. (1799-1802), Howard and Evans (1802-1811), John Evans (1811), J. Evans and son (c.1812-1817), John Evans and sons (1818‚Äì20) and J.& C. Evans (1820-29), and J.E. Evans (1829-1846).Stoker, (2017), p.329-30 & 343. Rivington Editions (1798-1851) The Lancashire Collier Girl, 1838 edition In addition to the continuing demand for reprints of individual tracts, there was also a demand for collected editions, aimed at a middle-class audience. In the Spring of 1798 the committee under Henry Thornton sold the copyrights of all the existing titles to Francis and Charles Rivington, printers to the S.P.C.K. This firm published a collected edition of official tracts in three volumes, (also printed by Evans), in the same year. This edition was reprinted in 1799 and 1800, and then at regular intervals until 1830. More would later regretted having 'given half the profits' to Rivington.Stott (2003), 208. Between 1829 and 1851 the firm published, two series of the existing titles with the imprints J.G. & F. and J.G.F. & J. Rivington on behalf of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. These were printed by R. Gilbert (latterly Gilbert & Rivington), as both individual tracts and in collected editions. Twenty-nine titles are listed on the Copac and WorldCat databases.Stoker, (2017) 343. Series published in the USA (1799-1803)- Individual tract titles were imported to the USA soon after their publication in England. From 1797 a few U.S. editions also began to be published in Philadelphia by B. Johnson.Weiss, (1946).p.542 & 634. Then in 1799 about sixty of the tracts (together with a few other non-Cheap Repository titles) appeared in two collected volumes of the tracts were published in New York by Cornelius Davis. Then during the course of 1800 a further forty-two of the titles were published in Philadelphia by B. & J. Johnson in a numbered Cheap Repository series.Weiss, (1946).p. 636-9. Further American collected editions were published by E. Lincoln of Boston in 1802 and 1803.Weiss, (1946).p. 639-41. The Cheap Repository in Scotland A similar monthly series of twenty-nine ‚Äò‚ÄôScotch Cheap Repository Tracts; containing Moral Tales for the Instruction of the Young,‚Äô‚Äô were produced by ‚Äòa Society of Clergymen in Dumfries-Shire‚Äô. They were modelled on Hannah More‚Äôs tracts but sought, ‚Äòto adapt this captivating more of instruction to the religious sentiments, as well as to the manner and habits, of the intelligent peasantry in the division of the United Kingdom‚Äô. The first of the Scots tracts was The History of Maitland Smith, published in 1807 to raise funds to support the family of the executed criminal in the title. Other titles included The Happy daughter, or the history of Jean Morton. by Elizabeth Hamilton (writer). A 2nd collected edition ‚Äòcorrected and greatly enlarged‚Äô was published in Edinburgh in 1815. One of Hannah More's 'Spa Fields' Tracts from 1817 'Spa Fields' Tracts (1817) The period immediately following the Napoleonic Wars saw popular dissatisfaction in England culminating in the Spa Fields riots of December 1816 and an abortive attempt to take control of the government. Hannah More therefore issued a number of entirely new, pro-establishment, titles during 1817 including The loyal subjects political creed; The Delegate; The Private Virtues of public Reformists; and Fair words and foul meaning. She also amended several of the earlier tracts to give them a stronger political message.Stoker, (2017), p.332-343. These were later republished in a collected edition, together with some of the more political earlier titles, entitled Cheap Repository Tracts, suited to the present times, in 1819. Impact of the Cheap Repository Tracts The publication of the Cheap Repository Tracts has been represented by some political historians as a conservative reaction to the success enjoyed by Thomas Paine's The Rights of Man and Age of Reason.E. P. Thompson, The Making of the English Working Class (New York: Vintage Books, 1966), 141‚Äì42. However, this may be an oversimplification of Hannah More's motives. Only a small proportion of the 1790s tracts were political in content; the majority attempted to reform the morals of the working classes, ‚Äúadopting the forms, writing styles, and even distribution channels of popular literature‚Äù.Pedersen,(1986),p.88. They were an undoubted publishing phenomenon and according to Richard Altick: \\"there had never been anything like it in the history of English books.\\"Altick, (1957), p. 75. Some of the titles, such as The shepherd of Salisbury plain were later translated in French, German and Russian. This title was also satirized by William Thackeray in Vanity Fair who talks of Lady Emily Hornblower and her tracts including The washerwoman of Finchley Common. Yet the extent of the impact that they may have had on the lives of the working classes, at whom they were aimed, has also been questioned. They may have been: \\"a huge hit among the middle classes, who ‚Ä¶had set up 'very respectable Societies' throughout the country, in order to distribute them.\\"Stott,(2003),p.176.

He had an immediate impact, for in 1973 he took 64 first-class wickets at 21.71, and scored 507 runs at 24.14, to help his new county to their second title. His bowling figures were even better in 1974 when they were foiled by the weather in the search for a second successive Championship, and through the 1970s he proved himself one of the best of Hampshire's signings from another county. In addition to his fine medium-pace bowling he scored his first century for the county in 1977, and there was another in 1978. In that season, age 35, he was a member of the Hampshire side that won the Sunday League, as he had been in 1975. He retired at the end of the 1980 season and became Hampshire's Assistant Secretary and then Marketing Manager, not least during the demanding 1990s in the move to the Rose Bowl. He took 308 first-class wickets for Hampshire at 24.21, plus 162 limited-overs wickets at 25.70 and an economy rate below four runs per over. His best bowling was 7-23 v his former county Nottinghamshire at Basingstoke in 1977. He retired from the office in 2002, after 30 years with his 'new' county. Across 11 English Winters from 1966-1979 (two in the UK), he coached three seasons for the Transvaal Cricket Union ( now Gauteng ) and eight for Jeppe High Schools for Boys, both based in Johannesburg. He also played one season for Pilkington Glass C.C in Springs, and five seasons for E.R.P.M .East Rand Propriety Mines in Boksburg (Winners of the Harlequin Cup 1974/75). Both these clubs were situated in what was the Northern Transvaal and he played one match for NT in the List A Datsun Shield v Rhodesia.

It is the anamorph of Nectria haematococca. It is a common soil fungus and colonist of plant materials. Fusarium solani is implicated in plant disease as well as human disease notably infection of the cornea of the eye. History and taxonomy The genus Fusarium was described in 1809 by Link. In the 1930s, Wollenweber and Reinking organized the genus Fusarium into sections, including Martiella and Ventricosum, which were collapsed together by Snyder and Hansen in the 1940s to form a single species, Fusarium solani; one of nine Fusarium species they recognized based on morphological features. The current concept of F. solani is as a species complex consisting of multiple, closely related and morphologically poorly distinguishable, \\"cryptic\\" species with characteristic genetic differences. The fungus is allied with the sexual species, Nectria haematococca, in the family Nectriaceae (phylum Ascomycota). Growth and morphology Like other species in its genus, Fusarium solani produces colonies that are white and cottony. However, instead of developing a pink or violet centre like most Fusarium species, F. solani becomes blue-green or bluish brown. On the underside, they may be pale, tea-with-milk-brown, or red- brown. However, some clinical isolates have been blue-green or ink-blue on the underside. F. solani colonies are low-floccose, loose, slimy, and sporadic. When grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA), this fungus grows rapidly, but not as rapidly as Fusarium oxysporum. In PDA, F. solani colonies reach a diameter of 64‚Äì70 mm in 7 days. F. solani has aerial hyphae that give rise to conidiophores laterally. The conidiophores branch into thin, elongated monophialides that produce conidia. Phialides that produce macroconidia are shorter than those that produce microconidia. The macroconidia produced by F. solani are slightly curved, hyaline, and broad, often aggregating in fascicles. Typically the macroconidia of this species have 3 septa but may have as many as 4‚Äì5. Microconidia have thickened basal cells and tapered, rounded apical cells. However, some F. solani isolates have pointed, rather than rounded, macroconidia. Microconidia are oval or cylindrical, hyaline, and smooth. Some microconidia may be curved. Microconidia typically lack septa, but occasionally they may have up to two. Fusarium solani also forms chlamydospores most commonly under suboptimal growth conditions. These may be produced in pairs or individually. They are abundant, have rough walls, and are 6-11 Œºm. F. solani chlamydospores are also brown and round.  Host and symptoms  F. solani is a very generalistic fungal specie and has been known to infect peas, beans, potatoes, and many types of cucurbits. There has been increasing evidence that F. solani can also act as a causal agent of mycoses in humans . F. solani can also cause damping off, corn rot, and root rot, as well as sudden death of soybeans(SDS) . Symptoms include general plant decline, wilting, and large necrotic spots on tap roots. Recently the pathogen has also done serious damage to olive trees throughout the mediterranean. F. solani has been and remains a serious economic disease in North and South America. Ecology F. solani is found in soil worldwide. However, a given species within the complex may not be as widespread and may not have the same ecology as others in the complex. In general, as a soil fungus, F. solani is associated with the roots of plants and may be found as deep in the ground as 80 cm. It is frequently isolated in tropic, subtropic, and temperate locations, and less frequently isolated from alpine habitats. The pH of soil does not have a significant effect on F. solani, however, soil fumigation causes an increase in occurrence. F. solani is typically sensitive to soil fungicides. F. solani has been found in ponds, rivers, sewage facilities, and water pipes. It has also been found in larvae and adults of the picnic beetle, is a symbiote of the ambrosia beetle.  Life cycle  F. solani can be found in soils worldwide, where its chlamydospores overwinter on plant tissue/seed or as mycelium in the soil . The pathogen enters hosts through developing roots, where it can infect the host. After infection, F. solani produces asexual macro and microconidia which are dispersed through wind and rain . The pathogen can persist in the soil for a decade, and if left unchecked can cause complete crop loss.  Management  The ubiquitous nature of F. solani gives rise to a plethora of management practices developed independently. One particular method is the use of the bacterial complex Burkholderia cepacia, which is a registered control method. This bacterial complex has been shown to produce several types of antibiotics (depending on the strain), and can act as a substitute for chemical pesticides. Precautionary methods include planting during warm/dry weather, 3 plus years of crop rotation of non host species, and avoiding dense seed planting . Physiology and biochemistry F. solani have 5-13 chromosomes, with a genome size of about 40 Mb. The GC-content of its DNA is 50%. Mycelium of F. solani is rich in the amino acid alanine, as well as a range of fatty acids including Œ¥-aminobutyric-, palmitic-, oleic-, and linolenic acids. Fusarium solani requires potassium for growth, and develops a feathery pattern when potassium levels are below 3 mM. In culture the following disaccharides are utilized (from most- to least preferential): mannose, rhamnose and sorbose. This species can decompose cellulose at an optimal pH of 6.5 and temperature of 30 ¬∞C. It can also metabolise steroids and lignin, and reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+. Fusarium solani produces mycotoxins like Fusaric acid and naphthoquinones. Other toxins have also been isolated from F. solani, including: * Fusarubin * Javanicin * Marticin * Isomarticin \\\\- causes chlorosis in citrus * Solaniol * Neosolaniol * T-2 toxin * HT-2 toxin * Diacetoxyscirpenol Pathology Humans Half of human disease involving Fusarium is caused by F. solani and it is involved in most cases of systemic fusariosis and corneal infections. F. solani has been implicated in the following diseases: disseminated disease, osteomyelitis, skin infection, fungemia, and endophthalmitis. In immunocompromised patients, F. solani is one of the most common agents in disseminated and cutaneous infections. Fungal keratitis in the southern USA is most commonly caused by F. solani, as well as F. oxysporum. Cases of fungal keratitis occur most frequently during harvest season as a result of corneal trauma from dust or plant material. Fungal spores come into contact with the damaged cornea and grow. Without treatment, the hyphae can grow into the cornea and into the anterior chamber of the eye. F. solani is also a major cause of fungal keratitis in HIV positive patients in Africa. F. solani was implicated in cases of fungal keratitis involving the Bausch and Lomb ReNu contact lens solution. Some strains of F. solani can produce a biofilm on soft contact lenses. However, when lenses are cleaned correctly with solution, these biofilms are prevented. Prevention also includes leaving lenses in polyhexanide biguanide solution overnight to inhibit F. solani. Other risk factors of contact lens-related Fusarium keratitis include use of daily-wear lenses beyond the recommended timeline and overnight wear. F. solani is largely resistant to typical antifungal agents. The most effective antifungals in treating F. solani infections are amphotericin B and natamycin; however, these agents have only modest success in the treatment of serious systemic infection. Other animals F. solani is implicated in cutaneous infections of young turtles as well as infections of turtle egg shells. It has also caused infections in Australian crocodile farms, sea lions and grey seals. F. solani is a facultative pathogen of the castor bean tick. It is also lethal to southern pine beetles. Plants F. solani rots the roots of its host plant. It also causes soft rot of plant tissues by penetrating plant cell walls and destroying the torus. It is implicated, along with Pythium myriotylum, in pod rot of the pods of groundnuts. Virulence of this agent in plants is controlled by the cutinase genes cut1 and cut2. These genes are upregulated by exposure to the plant‚Äôs cutin monomers. F. solani is known to cause sudden death syndrome in soybeans, and it is also known to cause disease in other economically important crops such as avocado, citrus, orchids, passion fruit, peas, peppers, potato, and squash. Biotechnology F. solani has been investigated as a biological control for certain plants including leafy spurge, morning glory, striga, gourd, and water hyacinth.

Sea Frontiers generally started at the shore of the United States and extended outwards into the sea for a nominal distance of two hundred miles. As early as 1927 the Navy's plans for the coastal defense of the United States and its Territories and possessions provided for the establishment of Naval Coastal Frontiers that would be larger operational commands than the individual Naval Districts.HyperWar, Federal Records of World War II Volume II Military Records, Part Four, 1083 On 1 July 1941, the Chief of Naval Operations formally established several Naval Coastal Frontiers; on 6 February 1942, these were renamed Sea Frontiers. Each Frontier was a geographic area, usually comprising a number of Naval Districts but including in addition the outer shipping lanes in its sea area. The land areas of the Frontiers corresponded roughly to the Army's Defense Commands, but the boundaries were not identical. The Frontier Commander was usually also the commandant of a Naval District within the Frontier. The chief responsibilities of the Sea Frontiers during World War II were operational; Frontier forces engaged actively in scouting for enemy forces, particularly submarines, and in attack on any enemy units within their boundaries. Toward the end of the war the Frontiers were assigned administrative and logistic functions in addition to their operational responsibilities. Navy General Order No. 143, issued on 3 February 1941, stated that Commandants of United States naval districts and Commanders of Naval Coastal Frontiers have administrative responsibility direct to the Navy Department for local and coastal forces; but Commanders of Naval Coastal Frontiers have task responsibility to the Chief of Naval Operations for Naval Coastal Frontier Forces. (Source Eastern Sea Frontier history, HyperWar) In addition to the Sea Frontiers under the cognizance of U.S. military authorities, the Canadian Coastal Zone was the responsibility of the Royal Canadian Navy. This formation was very active since the majority of trans- Atlantic convoys originated or terminated in Canadian waters.  List of Sea Frontiers  Alaskan Sea Frontier First established on 15 April 1944 with Vice Admiral Frank J.

Vice Admiral David W. Bagley served as COMHAWSEAFRON from 4 April 1942 until July 1943. The Hawaiian Sea Frontier did not actually come into a settled form until September 1942. The Assistant Chief of Staff (HawSeaFron) attempted to mold the organization to a degree similar to the Western Sea Frontier. The difficulty of selecting a site for the joint Operating Center delayed his plans. Originally, it was planned to have a district headquarters in Honolulu, with a part of the building devoted to the Frontier headquarters. When the plan did not prove feasible, it was decided to take two and a half tunnels at the Aliamanu Crater. Because of the limitations of space and the distance from the Commandant's headquarters, the location did not become more than an operational center. Since the Crater was on U.S. Army property, the construction of a Joint Operating Center with a major plot was never accomplished because of the fluctuations of the war and difficulties over appropriations. One service did not desire to build and pay more than its share of expenses from its limited appropriations for the benefit of another service. The Frontier suffered because of its unique location to the Pacific Fleet's sprawling auxiliary, ComServPac. These two echelons determined the number of vessels under its control as well as the complements of manpower. In cases of emergency, units of the Fleet took over convoy and antisubmarine patrols. Just as its surface units were controlled by higher echelons, so also were its air units by Air Forces, Pacific Fleet. The major functions of the Hawaiian Sea Frontier were the maintenance of picket ships outside Pearl Harbor and the Port of Honolulu, the escorting of inter- island shipping, and the establishment of air-sea rescue facilities.Following admirals held command of the frontier during the World War II: *Rear Admiral Claude C.

Its Commander was also Commandant of the Thirteenth Naval District, and its land area coincided with that of the District, which until April 1944. included Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming. For administrative and operational purposes the Frontier was divided into the Northwestern and the Alaskan Sectors. In conjunction with the Army the Frontier maintained the Joint Operations Center at Seattle.

P. pirinampu is also known as the flatwhiskered catfish. Taxonomy This species was first described as Pimelodus barbancho; however, this is considered a nomen oblitum. It was then described as Pimelodus pirinampu in 1829. In 1858, the genus Pinirampus was described for this species, in which it is usually classified as the only species. However, P. argentinus has been considered a part of this genus. Distribution This species is found in the Amazon, Essequibo, Orinoco, and Paran√° basins. Description P. pirinampu may reach a length of 60‚Äì75 centimetres (24‚Äì30 in) and an average weight of 3‚Äì5 kilograms (6.6‚Äì11 lb). This species has a maximum published weight of 7.68 kg (16.93 lb). These fish reach sexual maturity at just under 60 cm (24 in) in length. Ecology P. pirinampu occurs in schools. These catfish feed on benthic animals; they are nonspecialist feeders preying upon fish such as Iheringichthys labrosus and piranha Serrasalmus sp.. In the Amazon basin, these fish are preyed upon by Zungaro zungaro. These fish are known from temperatures ranging from 24 to 29 ¬∞C (75 to 84 ¬∞F), pH range of 6 to 8, and an alkalinity range of 42 to 142 mEq/L. P. pirinampu is a species of migratory catfish. These fish gather in schools in the dry season to swim upstream to the headwaters, where they spawn at the onset of the rainy season in February. After spawning, the adults and juveniles drift downstream, reaching flooded areas or reservoirs used as foraging, growth sites and shelter against predation. Relationship to humans P. pirinampu is important for the fishery yield in Amazonas, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Paran√°, and Roraima states. This species is included in the fishery statistics on the Paraguay River basin. Brazil's Mato Grosso do Sul state government has adopted the criterion of 60 cm (24 in) TL minimum capture size for P. pirinampu. P. pirinampu is an attractive fish for both leisure and professional sport fishers due to its tasteful meat and its fighting behavior. This species is one of the top ten dominant species in professional landings in the Itaipu reservoir of the Paran√° river, where it is captured with longlines and cast nets in the upper half of the reservoir. This species is also among the most important fishery resources in the Eng Souza Dias (Jupi√°) Reservoir in the Upper Paran√° river and the √Åguas Vermelhas reservoir in the Grande River.

It is generally still referred to by its former name of Wood Green Shopping City. The Mall had over 100 retail shops, seven of them anchor stores, 45 market stalls, and an average of 221,000 customers per week. The centre and the adjoining shops on Wood Green High Road constitute the commercial hub of the borough of Haringey and its surrounding areas. History The centre was built in the 1970s as \\"Wood Green Shopping City\\", on the site of the former Noel Park and Wood Green railway station. Initially it included a number of unusual features, most notably a giant wooden climbing frame in the shape of a frog. The centre was opened on 13 May 1981 by HM Queen Elizabeth II.Wood Green Shopping Mall is 30 - a look back, June 10, 2011 Unusually for a shopping centre, the A105 road runs directly through the complex, allowing many of the stores to have entrances directly onto the street. The two halves of the mall are linked by bridges at first and second floor level. The centre is six storeys high, but only the lower two floors are occupied by shops; the upper floors make up a housing complex known as \\"Sky City\\", where in 2006, the badly decomposed body of a woman was found. Her name was Joyce Vincent and she had died three years earlier, her body lay undiscovered. Vincent's life is the subject of the film Dreams of a Life (2011). In the early 1990s recession, many of the centre's established shops closed and were replaced by pound shops and charity shops. The centre was targeted in a bomb attack in 1992 that injured civilians and police officers.Police and shoppers injured in bomb blasts, The Independent, 11 December 1992 Redevelopment Construction work on the western extension, 2007 The centre was bought by current owners The Mall Company in 2002 and renamed \\"The Mall Wood Green\\", although the \\"Shopping City\\" signage remained as late as 2012. The new owners carried out a ¬£30 million rebuilding programme, altering the layout of the shops and adding a 12-screen cinema. The market hall was expanded, with a number of specialist retailers catering for the unusually diverse ethnic groups in the area. In 2007 the owners applied for consent to expand the centre further with a 3-storey extension on the site of an adjacent petrol station, which when complete will increase the mall size to 617,000 sq ft (57,300m¬≤) and the total number of retail units to 123, overtaking rival Brent Cross's 110 shops for the first time. Approval was given in May 2007, despite concerns raised about the possibility of flooding on the new site from the River Moselle; in June 2007 it was announced that the bulk of the extension would be occupied by a new Debenhams store. The proposal involved demolishing the existing Pearson's department store and extending the mall into space within and beyond this site. However, the Debenhams plan ultimately did not go ahead, and instead the bulk of the development site was taken up by a large Primark store.Haringey Independent The Mall is also the venue for a craft fair, held four times a year. Aerial view of The Mall Wood Green and Sky City Crime Unusually for a shopping centre, The Mall has its own dedicated team of police, part of Haringey BOCU police. The scheme, initially called \\"Operation Partnership\\" but later renamed the \\"Retail Protection Unit\\", was introduced in 1998. The areas surrounding the Mall have traditionally been affected by high rates of street-drinking and its accompanying alcohol-related problems. In 2005 anti-drinking legislation was introduced, and the police were given powers to confiscate alcoholic drinks and to disperse crowds in the area around the centre. The Mall made headlines in 2006 when a shoplifter attacked and repeatedly stabbed Designer Outlet store supervisor Rudy Takkou. Takkou narrowly survived, losing 4 litres of blood. Transport Despite being situated on the site of a disused railway station, The Mall Wood Green is still very well served by public transport in comparison to London's other shopping centres. Wood Green and Turnpike Lane tube stations on the Piccadilly line are both near the mall, and due to Wood Green High Road running through the centre of the development, it is possible to catch buses from directly outside the shops. Alexandra Palace railway station is a short distance to the west of the centre.

Ice Alaska put on its first ice art championship in 1991; it featured 16 sculpting teams and lasted a week. Today the event begins mid February and, weather permitting, lasts until the end of March, featuring the art and skill of as many as 75 teams from around the world. Locations: Through 2011, the ice festival took place on a site across the Chena River from Pioneer Park, which the organizers leased from the Alaska Railroad. In 2012 the event moved to a new location, the George Horner Ice Art Park. In 2017, after a fire destroyed their main lodge, the Ice Alaska organization restructured to protect the future of the event. Then, in 2018 they reached an agreement with the Tanana Valley State Fair Association and moved the World Ice Art Championships, along with the associated Ice Alaska Ice Park, to the Tanana Valley State Fairgrounds. Ice Alaska has negotiated with a new property owner to harvest ice blocks and transport them to the new venue; the ice is so clear it is referred to as \\"arctic diamond\\". In addition to sculptures on view, the event features a Kids Park sculpted out of ice, including ice slides, an ice maze, an ice rink, and spinning cups.

Behind the nose are the olfactory mucosa and the sinuses. Behind the nasal cavity, air next passes through the pharynx, shared with the digestive system, and then into the rest of the respiratory system. In humans, the nose is located centrally on the face and serves as an alternative respiratory passage especially during suckling for infants. Air treatment 3D medical animation still shot depicting a human nose Acting as the first interface between the external environment and an animal's delicate internal lungs, a nose conditions incoming air, both as a function of thermal regulation and filtration during respiration, as well as enabling the sensory perception of smell. Hair inside nostrils filter incoming air, as a first line of defense against dust particles, smoke, and other potential obstructions that would otherwise inhibit respiration, and as a kind of filter against airborne illness. In addition to acting as a filter, mucus produced within the nose supplements the body's effort to maintain temperature, as well as contributes moisture to integral components of the respiratory system. Capillary structures of the nose warm and humidify air entering the body; later, this role in retaining moisture enables conditions for alveoli to properly exchange O2 for CO2 (i.e., respiration) within the lungs. During exhalation, the capillaries then aid recovery of some moisture, mostly as a function of thermal regulation, again. Sense of direction The wet nose of dogs is useful for the perception of direction. The sensitive cold receptors in the skin detect the place where the nose is cooled the most and this is the direction a particular smell that the animal just picked up comes from.Dijkgraaf, S. (1978). Vergelijkende dierfysiologie; Bohn: Scheltema en Holkema, Structure in air-breathing forms The nose of a tapir. In amphibians and lungfish, the nostrils open into small sacs that, in turn, open into the forward roof of the mouth through the choanae. These sacs contain a small amount of olfactory epithelium, which, in the case of caecilians, also lines a number of neighbouring tentacles. Despite the general similarity in structure to those of amphibians, the nostrils of lungfish are not used in respiration, since these animals breathe through their mouths. Amphibians also have a vomeronasal organ, lined by olfactory epithelium, but, unlike those of amniotes, this is generally a simple sac that, except in salamanders, has little connection with the rest of the nasal system. In reptiles, the nasal chamber is generally larger, with the choanae located much further back in the roof of the mouth. In crocodilians, the chamber is exceptionally long, helping the animal to breathe while partially submerged. The reptilian nasal chamber is divided into three parts: an anterior vestibule, the main olfactory chamber, and a posterior nasopharynx. The olfactory chamber is lined by olfactory epithelium on its upper surface and possesses a number of turbinates to increase the sensory area. The vomeronasal organ is well-developed in lizards and snakes, in which it no longer connects with the nasal cavity, opening directly into the roof of the mouth. It is smaller in turtles, in which it retains its original nasal connection, and is absent in adult crocodilians. Birds have a similar nose to reptiles, with the nostrils located at the upper rear part of the beak. Since they generally have a poor sense of smell, the olfactory chamber is small, although it does contain three turbinates, which sometimes have a complex structure similar to that of mammals. In many birds, including doves and fowls, the nostrils are covered by a horny protective shield. The vomeronasal organ of birds is either under- developed or altogether absent, depending on the species. Elephants have prehensile noses. The nasal cavities in mammals are both fused into one. Among most species they are exceptionally large, typically occupying up to half the length of the skull. In some groups, however, including primates, bats, and cetaceans, the nose has been secondarily reduced, and these animals consequently have a relatively poor sense of smell. The nasal cavity of mammals has been enlarged, in part, by the development of a palate cutting off the entire upper surface of the original oral cavity, which consequently becomes part of the nose, leaving the palate as the new roof of the mouth. The enlarged nasal cavity contains complex turbinates forming coiled scroll-like shapes that help to warm the air before it reaches the lungs. The cavity also extends into neighbouring skull bones, forming additional air cavities known as paranasal sinuses. In cetaceans, the nose has been reduced to the nostrils, which have migrated to the top of the head, producing a more streamlined body shape and the ability to breathe while mostly submerged. Conversely, the elephant's nose has elaborated into a long, muscular, manipulative organ called the trunk. The vomeronasal organ of mammals is generally similar to that of reptiles. In most species, it is located in the floor of the nasal cavity, and opens into the mouth via two nasopalatine ducts running through the palate, but it opens directly into the nose in many rodents. It is, however, lost in bats, and in many primates, including humans. In fish Fish have a relatively good sense of smell. Unlike that of tetrapods, the nose has no connection with the mouth, nor any role in respiration. Instead, it generally consists of a pair of small pouches located behind the nostrils at the front or sides of the head. In many cases, each of the nostrils is divided into two by a fold of skin, allowing water to flow into the nose through one side and out through the other. The pouches are lined by olfactory epithelium, and commonly include a series of internal folds to increase the surface area. In some teleosts, the pouches branch off into additional sinus-like cavities, while in coelacanths, they form a series of tubes. Unlike tetrapods, the nasal epithelium of fishes does not include any mucus-secreting cells, since it is already naturally moist. In the most primitive living vertebrates, the lampreys and hagfish, there is only one nostril and olfactory pouch. Indeed, the nostril also opens into the hypophysis. This is not necessarily, however, a primitive trait, but one that may have arisen later in the evolution of these particular groups. For example, the fossil heterostracans had paired nostrils, and these were also a very early vertebrate group.

Holmstr√∂m proving that no incentive system for a team of agents can make all of the following true: # Income equals outflow (the budget balances), # The system has a Nash equilibrium, and # The system is Pareto efficient. Thus a Pareto-efficient system with a balanced budget does not have any point at which an agent can not do better by changing their effort level, even if everyone else's effort level stays the same, meaning that the agents can never settle down to a stable strategy; a Pareto-efficient system with a Nash equilibrium does not distribute all revenue, or spends more than it has; and a system with a Nash equilibrium and balanced budget does not maximise the total profit of everybody. The Gibbard‚ÄìSatterthwaite theorem in social choice theory is a related impossibility theorem dealing with voting systems. Statement of the theorem Suppose there is a team of n > 1 risk neutral agents whose preference functions are strictly concave and increasing, and also additively separable in money and effort. Then, under an incentive system that distributes exactly the output among the team members, any Nash equilibrium is Pareto inefficient. RasmusenEric Rasmusen, \\"Moral Hazard in Risk-Averse Teams\\", The RAND Journal of Economics 18, no. 3 (1987), pp. 428‚Äì435. studies the relaxation of this problem obtained by removing the assumption that the agents are risk neutral (Holmstr√∂m: \\"linear in money\\"). The economic reason for Holmstr√∂m's result is a \\"Sharing problem\\". A team member faces efficient incentives if he receives the full marginal returns from an additional unit of his input. Under a budget-balanced sharing scheme, however, the team members cannot be incentivized this way. This problem would be circumvented if the output could be distributed n times instead of only once. This requires that the team members promise fixed payments to an \\"Anti-Sharer\\", as demonstrated by Kirstein and Cooter.Roland Kirstein and Robert Cooter, \\"Sharing and Anti- Sharing in Teams\\", Economics Letters 96, no. 3 (2007), pp. 351-356. However, if one of the team members takes over the role of the Anti-Sharer, this player has no incentive whatsoever to spend effort. The article derives conditions under which internal Anti-Sharing induces the team members to spend more effort than a budget-balanced sharing contract.

The Eastern Sea Frontier (EASTSEAFRON) was a United States Navy operational command during World War II, that was responsible for the coastal waters from Canada to Jacksonville, Florida, extending out for a nominal distance of two hundred miles. The Commander was designated Commander, Eastern Sea Frontier (COMEASTSEAFRON). COMEASTSEAFRON had vessels for convoy use or other uses determined by the commander. In addition to providing escorts for convoys within its frontier, the frontier was responsible for sea-air rescue, harbor defense, shipping lane patrol, minesweeping, and air operations. History Although the Code of Federal Regulations indicate Eastern Sea Frontier's commander also served as commander of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet as of 1937‚Äì38;The Code of federal regulations of the United States of America having general applicability and legal effect in force 1 June 1938: 1st ed., published by the Division of the Federal register, the National archives, pursuant to section 11 of the Federal register act as amended 19 June 1937 (Google eBook) On 14 January 1941, orders were issued to transfer Rear Admiral Andrews from his command as Commander, Scouting Force, United States Fleet to a new command as Commandant, Third Naval District. These orders were modified under date of 1 March 1941, giving Admiral Andrews additional duties as Commander, North Atlantic Naval Coastal Frontier. When he relieved Rear Admiral C. H. Woodward on 10 March 1941 for the first time the Commandant, Third Naval District was also designated as Commander, North Atlantic Naval Coastal Frontier. The preparation of operation plans, which had been laid down in WPL-42 and in Navy Basic War Plan, RAINBOW No. 3 (PL-44), the latter having been promulgated in December 1940 was continued and on 16 March 1941 the first Operation Plan: North Atlantic Naval Coastal Frontier Plan 0‚Äì4 (RAINBOW 3), with the short title, NA-NCF-44 was issued. This Plan set up the proposed Staff of the Commander, North Atlantic Naval Coastal Frontier, which consisted of the following: Chief of Staff, Operations Officer, Shipping Control Officer, Air Officer, First Army Liaison Officer Intelligence Officer and Communication Officer. It also provided for the Command Relations and the plans for coordination with the Army Commander. Nevertheless, at this time, no officers were immediately available to fill these commands. On 3 April 1941, a second plan was issued to modify NA-NCF-44 in such a way as to make it applicable to the concept of war outlined in \\"RAINBOW No. 1.\\" This modification was entitled, North Atlantic Naval Coastal Frontier Plan O-4 (RAINBOW No. 1), with the short title, NA-NCF-42. On 22 April 1941, a third plan was issued: the original Operation Plan for the Forces of the North Atlantic Naval Coastal Frontier. This plan was designated, \\"Operation Plan, NA-NCF-1-41.\\" Because of the restricted nature of problems concerned with the organization of task forces and task groups within a naval coastal frontier, this aspect is considered in a separate section. It may suffice to state briefly, here, that at this time, task forces were not created. When the Navy Basic War Plan, RAINBOW No. 2 (WPL-46) was issued in May 1941, important directives were contained therein as to the eventual organization of task forces and command relations in the naval coastal frontiers; nevertheless, these directives merely outline the structure of an organization which would not be created until a later order was issued. WPL-46 had incorporated the structure of task forces as they had been ordered by General Order No. 143, issued 3 February 1941. On 1 July 1941, the Chief of Naval Operations formally ordered the establishment of naval coastal frontiers, thus transforming them from their theoretical status;Morison, pp.207&208 but added in the same dispatch, \\"For the present, Naval Coastal Frontier Forces, as prescribed in General Order No. 143, will not be formed.\\" On 6 February 1942, the Secretary of the Navy formally changed the names of the coastal frontiers to sea frontiers; thereafter, the North Atlantic Naval Coastal Frontier was designated the Eastern Sea Frontier. Eastern Sea Frontier's headquarters were located at 90 Church Street in Lower Manhattan. The commander of the Eastern Sea Frontier, until the closing months of 1943, was then-Rear Admiral Adolphus Andrews. COMEASTSEAFRON had control and responsibility for convoys within its defined area. Convoys from adjacent sea frontiers would continue across sea frontier boundaries. Since the Eastern Sea Frontier coordinated with the Royal Canadian Navy for convoys crossing into the Canadian Coastal Zone, the Eastern Sea Frontier was the \\"parent\\" of the contiguous sea frontiers to the south, and COMEASTSEAFRON authority extended beyond its own frontier. COMEASTSEAFRON operational orders could only be appealed to Admiral Ernest King. Aircraft COMEASTSEAFRON resources included a blimp airship group at Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst, a special convoy air escort group at Naval Air Station Quonset Point, and the Northern, Narragansett, New York, Delaware, Chesapeake, and Southern Air Groups operating from sixteen airfields from Bar Harbor NAAF to Naval Air Station Jacksonville.Morison, p.248 COMEASTSEAFRON worked closely with the U.S. Army Air Force in the defense of the frontier. Usually, offices of the U.S. Navy and U.S. Army Air Force officers assigned to the frontier, had their offices side by side in order to create effective two-way communications and expedited reaction to reports of enemy presence.

Early Life Theod√≥sio Clemente de Gouveia was born in S√£o Jorge, Madeira, to farmers Clemente Francisco de Gouveia and Ana Augusta Jardim. Baptized on 25 May 1889 by Vicar Jos√© Calisto de Andrade, and having as godparents Theod√≥sio Francisco de Gouveia and Maria Rosa Jardim. Being 16 years old, he entered Our Lady of the Incarnation Seminary, run by the Claretians, in Funchal on 4 October 1905. The seminary was confiscated in 1910 by revolutionaries, and Gouveia and his fellow students were taken to the Claretian house of studies in Paris in 1912. Due to the German invasion, they were again moved in 1914, this time to the Lazarist seminary in Dax. Gouveia, during his time in Paris, also attended the Seminary of Saint-Sulpice and Catholic Institute of Paris.  Ecclesiastic Career  Gouveia, who had joined the Lazarists in 1911, left the religious institute in 1915. He then went to Rome in January 1916 to study at the Pontifical Gregorian University (from where he obtained doctorates in theology and in canon law), whilst residing at the Col√©gio Portugu√™s. After receiving the subdiaconate and diaconate in 1918, Gouveia was eventually ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Basilio Pompili on 19 April 1919. He attended the School of Social Studies in Bergamo from 1920 to 1921, when he entered the University of Louvain. Returning to Madeira in 1922, he was named secretary of the ecclesiastical chamber of the Diocese of Funchal and a professor at its seminary. Gouveia was Vice-Rector (1929‚Äì1934) and later Rector (1934‚Äì1936) of the Pontifical Portuguese College in Rome. During this time, he also served as rector of the church of Sant'Antonio dei Portoghesi. He was raised to the rank of Privy Chamberlain of His Holiness on 26 November 1931, and Domestic Prelate of His Holiness on 23 April 1934. On 18 May 1936, Gouveia was appointed Territorial Prelate of Mozambique and Titular Bishop of Leuce. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 5 July from Cardinal Raffaele Rossi, with Archbishops Ernesto Senna de Oliveira and Ildebrando Antoniutti serving as co-consecrators, in S. Antonio dei Portoghesi. Gouveira was later named the first Archbishop of Louren√ßo Marques on 4 September 1940, being installed on 18 January 1941. During his tenure he was gained notoriety for being a champion of Catholic education. Pope Pius XII created him Cardinal Priest of San Pietro in Vincoli in the consistory of 18 February 1946.

Shibboleths used in war and persecution Dutch‚ÄìFrench * Schild en vriend: On 18 May 1302, the people of Bruges killed the French occupiers of the city during a nocturnal surprise attack. According to a famous legend, they stormed into the houses where they knew the tenants were forced to board and lodge French troops serving as city guards, roused every male person from his bed and forced them to repeat the challenge schild en vriend (shield and friend). The Flemings pronounced with a separate \\"s\\" and \\"ch\\" \\". Flemings would pronounce with a voiced v whereas French would render those as a voiceless f. Every Frenchman who failed the test was stabbed on the spot, still in his nightgown. Because the signal for the uprising was the matins bells of the city's churches and monasteries, this became known as the Bruges Matins or Brugse Metten. Like the name of the massacre, the story may have been influenced by the Sicilian uprising mentioned below. * The problem with this legend is that in Medieval manuscripts of that time, a shield is referred to as \\"skilde\\" as in Norse and Norse-influenced English words. Therefore, it is sometimes said that the words must have been \\"'s gilden vriend\\" meaning \\"friend of the guilds.\\" The combination of the 's and the g in \\"'s gilden\\" would be pronounced . Italian/Sicilian‚ÄìFrench * Ciciri (chickpeas): This was used by native Sicilians to ferret out Angevin French soldiers in the late 13th century during the Sicilian Vespers, the uprising which freed the island from Angevin rule. Both the Italian soft c , and the Italian r, were (and are still) difficult for the French to pronounce as that sequence of sounds seldom appears in French; also, in French, words are primarily stressed on the final syllable. Frisian‚ÄìDutch B√ªter, brea, en griene tsiis; wa't dat net sizze kin, is gjin oprjochte Fries * B√ªter, brea, en griene tsiis; wa't dat net sizze kin, is gjin oprjochte Fries () means \\"Butter, rye bread and green cheese, whoever cannot say that is not a genuine Frisian\\" was used by the Frisian Pier Gerlofs Donia during a Frisian rebellion (1515‚Äì1523). Ships whose crew could not pronounce this properly were usually plundered and soldiers who could not were beheaded by Donia himself. Castilian Spanish‚ÄìLatin-American Spanish * During the Latin American wars of independence, the name was used by Colombian rebels to tell locals from Spaniards. Whoever pronounced it as (as in European Spanish) as opposed to would have been thrown into the Magdalena River. English‚ÄìDutch * The Peasants' Revolt of 1381 (also Tyler's Rebellion, or the Great Rising) was used by the merchants of London in an attempt to get a competitive edge in the trade with the Low Countries by reducing the number of competitors. A massacre among the Flemings in London ‚Äì not just the Flemish merchants ‚Äì ensued. \\"And many fflemmynges loste hir heedes at that tyme and namely they that koude nat say Breede and Chese, but Case and Brode.\\"Chronicles of London; Oxford University Press, 1905; ed. C. L. Kingsford; p. 15 Finnish‚ÄìRussian * : Finnish for \\"one\\", used by the White Guard to separate Russians from Finns in the Finnish Civil War during the invasion of Tampere. Many of the Russians caught had changed to civilian clothing, so suspected people were rounded up, even from hospitals, and asked to say . If the prisoner pronounced it , mistaking the front vowel 'y' for an iotated 'u' (—é), he was considered a Russian foreign fighter and was shot on the spot. Any Slav or Balt, Communist or not, was killed, including some members of the White Guard.Heikki Ylikangas, Tie Tampereelle * : Finnish for \\"steam roller\\", used by the Finnish Army in the Second World War. This word is almost impossible to pronounce for anyone not skilled in Finnish, with the frontal '√∂' and 'y' and rolled 'r' . For Russian speakers, also the leading 'h' is difficult.:fi:≈†ibbolet Spanish‚ÄìFrench and Haitian Creole * Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo conducted a brutal massacre of undocumented Haitian settlers along the Dominican-Haitian border. The action is known as the Parsley Massacre. Suspects not fluent in Spanish either did not know or could not properly pronounce the Spanish word 'perejil' (parsley). The pronunciation of the word by Haitian citizens tended to be with a trilled r, unlike the native Spanish tapped r, and without the 'l' at the end of the word.

Anyone over the age of 7 who could not pronounce these Polish words was put to death, ejected from the city or had his property confiscated. '≈Å' (then pronounced as a velarized alveolar lateral approximant, aka dark l) and dental [sÃ™] are both unlikely to be pronounced properly by Germans since they cannot make out the difference from their own sounds [l] and [s]. (The former was approximated by Germans as l, and has evolved now into a sound similar to English w). Culture, religion and language-specific shibboleths * English-speaking Allied personnel in Europe, during the Second World War, frequently made use of passwords in which labio-velar approximants (w-sounds) were prominent, as these are unusual in spoken German, and the letter w is normally pronounced \\"v\\" by native speakers of German. For instance, following D-Day (1944) US forces used the challenge- response \\"Flash\\" ‚Äì \\"Thunder\\" ‚Äì \\"Welcome\\". * American English can ferret out German infiltrators during their time in the Western Front. German spies were taught British English, which was different from American English. For example, Brits used the word lorry, for truck. American used words to shibboleth Nazi spies. * Israeli forces during the 1948 Palestine war used passwords chosen to contain voiceless bilabial stops (p-sounds), which are not found in Arabic, and which native speakers of Arabic often replace with a voiced bilabial stop (b-sounds). * In the Lebanese Civil War of 1975, Christian Lebanese soldiers targeted suspected Palestinians at checkpoints by asking how they pronounced the Arabic word for \\"tomato\\", which is pronounced \\"banadoura\\" in Lebanese Arabic and \\"bandoura\\" in Palestinian Arabic. If they said the former, they were let through; if they said the latter, they were shot on the spot. * During the Somali Islamic terrorist group al-Shabaab's 2013 shooting and hostage siege attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, Kenya, the attackers asked for Islamic prophet Muhammad's mother Aminah bint Wahb's name and the shahada as religious shibboleths to determine Muslims and non-Muslims. Muslims were freed, while non-Muslims were targeted. An Indian man who could not name Aminah was shot dead. * The mostly Christian Filipino ground troops fighting in the 2013 Zamboanga City crisis used the Lord's Prayer as a way to identify Moro insurgents. Those who could not recite the Lord's Prayer in any Philippine language, including English, were immediately suspected of being part of the armed Moro National Liberation Front and detained. All non-Christians, including non-combatant Muslims, would also fail the test. English shibboleths for native speakers or local natives * Fish and chips: The accents of Australians and New Zealanders seem very similar, and the term fish and chips is sometimes evoked to illustrate a major difference between the two. In New Zealand pronunciation short i is a central vowel, . This vowel sound is sometimes caricatured as \\"fush and chups\\" by Australians. The Australian pronunciation has the front vowel (which is more common in most varieties of English) which, due to an overall vowel shift in New Zealand, sounds like \\"feesh and cheeps\\" to the ears of a New Zealander, sounding like an instance of the \\"Fill‚Äìfeel merger\\". * Pronunciation of letters of the alphabet: ** H: in Northern Ireland pronounced 'aitch' by Protestants, and 'haitch' by Catholics, per Hiberno-English. Also often pronounced 'haitch' in dialects of English spoken in former colonies of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, usually among non-native English speakers, but in the case of Australia, also among native speakers, especially those of Irish descent. ** Z: in North America pronounced zee in the United States; typically zed in the rest of the world. Known in American history and popular culture for distinguishing American males who fled to Canada from the US to escape the military draft in the 1950s and 60s. The Canadian pronunciation was featured in the Molson Canadian I Am Canadian advertisement in 2000.Blame Canada and Molson for brilliant 'Rant' at States, Advertising Age, 8 May 2000 * In Highland Dress, for anyone who has served in a Scottish Regiment or played in a pipe band, or whenever said by a Scot, if ‚Äòplaid‚Äô should be used to refer to tartan cloth, it could be pronounced: (to rhyme with 'had'). NB: This usage, as a synonym for 'tartan', is generally only ever found in North America.English Language & Usage:\\"Is there any difference between 'plaid' and 'tartan'?\\" More often, however, when referring to the cape-like garment, in its various forms, worn over the left shoulder as part of the traditional or formal Scottish dress, the pronunciation is: (to rhyme with 'made'); though the OED accepts both pronunciations in this usage. To further stress the difference in pronunciation of the garment versus the cloth, the garment has an alternative spelling 'plaide', though rarely used. Thus: belted-plaid, drummer's plaid, evening-plaid, fly-plaid, full-plaid, piper's plaid, et al., are pronounced by those who have worn, or are familiar, with the same. Etymology: plaide (Scots) via Scottish Gaelic meaning 'blanket' or 'cloak', (albeit usually made of tartan; most often the same tartan as the wearer's kilt or trews).\\"plaid\\", Collins English Dictionary.

For example, Southern Californians usually refer to Highway 101 as \\"The 101,\\" whereas Northern Californians will refer to it as simply \\"101.\\" By comparison, people in the rest of the United States more often precede a freeway's route number with its highway classification, as in \\"U.S. 101\\" for a Federal highway or \\"Interstate 5\\" or \\"I-5\\" for an interstate highway. * Long-time Democratic residents of Washington, D.C., will refer to Reagan National Airport as simply as \\"National,\\" while Republicans and visitors to the area are more likely to call it by the name of the former president. * Additionally, some residents of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area will refer to it as \\"The DMV\\" (the District, Maryland, and Virginia, specifically referencing the Fairfax, Alexandria, and Arlington Counties of Virginia; the city itself; and the Montgomery and Prince George's Counties of Maryland).

Although it saw limited production, the type was well-received as a bush plane in Canada. Design and development Typical for the era, the Barkley-Grow T8P-1 was a low-wing monoplane of all- metal construction with a twin tail (an additional third tail was installed, √† la Lockheed Constellation, when fitted with floats). The T8P (standing for Transport, 8 Passenger) was designed to be simple and rugged, thus the main units of the tailwheel undercarriage were not retractable, and this may have negatively impacted the type's reception in the marketplace. A novel design feature, however, was the wing structure. Barkley used what might be called a \\"horizontal cell\\" technique that has no ribs or spars. Long tapered strips of aluminium were bent to form V shapes which were then riveted tip to tip to form an \\"X\\". These \\"X\\"s are riveted inside the wing side by side to produce the long \\"cells\\". This wing structure was unique to the Barkley-Grow and according to mechanics who worked on the aircraft it was very light, very stiff, very expensive to build, and difficult to repair if damaged, but it gave no problems in service.\\"Dibnah, Larry. \\"The Barkley-Grow T8P-1. (In My Travels).\\" The Patrician, Victoria Flying Club, February 2007. Retrieved: December 7, 2009.

Barkley- Grow T8P-1 aircraft CF-BMW of Yukon Southern on floats on an Albertan lake in 1942 Operational history Sales in the US were disappointing, only 11 being built, and most machines (seven) were sold to Canada, where the fixed undercarriage was no obstacle to the fitting of skis or pontoons. One was selected for a record flight from Washington D.C. to Peru, and another was used in the Antarctic by the US Navy. In 1942 A T8P-1 flown by Maritime Central Airways was used in the rescue attempt of survivors of a B-17 on the Greenland ice shelf. The aircraft was fitted with skis but force-landed on the ice on 22 December 1942 after encountering strong headwinds. The T8P-1 broke through the ice and sank leaving the pilots to be rescued by Inuit tribesmen.http://librarum.org/book/35333/88 Surviving aircraft * 1 ‚Äì T8P-1 in storage at the Reynolds-Alberta Museum in Wetaskiwin, Alberta. * 3 ‚Äì T8P-1 on static display at the Alberta Aviation Museum in Edmonton, Alberta.

In 1962, she was canonized a saint in the Catholic Church by Pope John XXIII. She is considered the patron saint of travellers, and specifically couriers, guides, pilgrims, flight attendants, and the city of Pisa.Independent.co.uk, \\"The art of naming babies\\" Biography A native of Pisa, she is reported as having experienced visions from an early age. On one occasion, the figure on the crucifix at the Holy Sepulchre church held out his hand to her. At another church, she saw a vision of Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and three saints, including James the Greater. She was frightened by the light around these figures, and ran away. James pursued her, and led her back to the image of Jesus. Bona observed a very pronounced devotion to James for the rest of her life. By the age of ten, she had dedicated herself as an Augustinian tertiary. She regularly fasted from an early age, taking only bread and water three days a week. Four years later, she made the first of her many journeys, going to see her father who was fighting in the Crusades near Jerusalem. On her trip home, she was captured by Muslim pirates on the Mediterranean Sea, wounded, and subsequently imprisoned. Remains of Santa Bona, in Church of San Martino, Pisa She was later rescued by some of her countrymen, and completed her trip home. Shortly thereafter, she set out on another pilgrimage, this time leading a large number of pilgrims on the long and dangerous thousand-mile journey to Santiago de Compostela, where James the Greater is honored. After this, she was made one of the official guides along this pilgrimage route by the Knights of Saint James. She successfully completed the trip nine times. Despite being ill at the time, she took and completed a tenth trip, and returned home to Pisa, dying shortly thereafter in the room she kept near the Church of San Martino in Pisa, where her body has been preserved to the present day.

Known for her innovative method that is based in the intersection of brain science, personal development, and deep understanding of dogs' behavior, which made her popular with celebrity clientele such as Oprah, Lady Gaga, the Kardashians, Tony Robbins, Reese Witherspoon, Mark Wahlberg, Brad Paisley and many others. Oprah called Tamar ‚ÄúLife coach for dogs and their people\\" as Tamar has transformed lives and impacted relationships not only for dogs, but also for the people who love them. After serving as an intelligence officer working with the Israeli Special Forces, she spent time to observing wolves in the wild and studying the role of the leader as a parent and protector of his pack. By using similar techniques as the wolves, she created a method of training puppies that does not involve aggression, dominance, or choke chains. Tamar‚Äôs method goes beyond positive reinforcement as she emphasizes building a solid relationship with the dog based on understanding the dog as the individual that s/he is and coaching them through games and fun to become the best version of themselves. She strongly opposes the training methods that want a dog to be submissive. Tamar believes in helping PAWrents empower their dog to be the best s/he could be and build a relationship that is based on mutual devotion and love. She is the founder of the first cage-free doggy boarding and day care center in southern California, called The Loved Dog. Her first book of the same name teaches dog-owners how to train their dogs in a nonaggressive way. Among other things, Geller works closely with the animal rights organizations Humane Society of the United States, American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Best Friends Animal Society, Helen Woodward Animal Center, and various rescue organizations. She conducts speeches and programs for rescue organizations, and has given lectures about her expertise in dog behavior at Cal-Poly University Veterinary school and at Pepperdine University. She has appeared on various television programs and media outlets, including The Today Show, Oprah, Ellen, The Kardashians, Animal Planet, CNN, Entertainment Tonight, Access Hollywood, Extra, Insider, HLN, Fox News, CNN, HGTV, TLC, Bravo,20/20, New York Times, Hollywood Reporter, Newsweek, People, USA Today, US Weekly, Travel + Leisure, Reporter and Men's Health. The Loved Dog Tamar created The Loved Dog‚Ñ¢ method over 30 years ago based on the knowledge she acquired as an intelligence officer in the Israeli Special Forces, from the time she spent observing wolves in the wild, and from personal/spiritual development work. She rejects the popular concept of teaching dogs to obey five commands, and instead teaches dogs essential life skills that they need to succeed in our human society. Tamar believes the key is to empower them to know how to self regulate impulses especially when triggered, and make good decisions, in the same way human toddlers are taught to do the same. Tamar and The Loved Dog‚Ñ¢ method builds a relationship based on love and devotion that goes both ways. Learning through fun games, clear communication and mutual respect. Rejecting the painful collars, choke chains, and shock collars that have been common tools of dog trainers for decades, Tamar honors the wisdom and greatness of dogs and educates with kindness and compassion. This is the only training method endorsed by The Humane Society of the United States. Philanthropy Driven by her desire to improve the lives of people and animals in need by nurturing the power of dogs‚Äô healing power, Tamar founded The Loved World Foundation by Tamar Geller. With her background as a former intelligence officer in the Israeli Special Forces and understanding first-hand the challenges of being a veteran, she created the Operation Heroes & Hounds‚Ñ¢ program. The program was established in 2007 to aid injured members of the United States military suffering from physical and non-visible wounds. She also created ‚ÄúAnother Chance for Love‚Äù which helps juvenile prisoners develop self-esteem and life skills by lovingly and compassionately coaching the shelter dogs with The Loved Dog‚Ñ¢ method.

Instead, it is often a pseudotriangle on radiographic findings, with ossification on the original bone and one additional side of the triangle, which forms a two sided triangle with one open side. This two sided appearance is generated due to a tumor (or growth) that is growing at a rate which is faster than the periosteum can grow or expand, so instead of dimpling, the periosteum tears away and provides ossification on the second edge of the triangle.Periosteal Reaction The advancing tumour displaces the perisosteum away from the bone medulla.

The screenplay was adapted from the 1941 novel Above Suspicion by Scots-American writer Helen MacInnes, which is loosely based on experiences of MacInnes and her husband, Gilbert Highet. The plot follows two newlyweds who spy on the Nazis for the British Secret Service during their honeymoon in Europe. Plot In the spring of 1939 in England, Oxford University Professor Richard Myles (Fred MacMurray) and his new bride Frances (Joan Crawford) decide to honeymoon on the Continent. Because they are American tourists and therefore \\"above suspicion,\\" they are commissioned by the British secret service to find a scientist who has developed a countermeasure against a new Nazi secret weapon, a magnetic sea mine. Without knowing his name, what he looks like, or where to find him, the couple look upon the search as an adventure and cross Europe seeking clues from clandestine contacts. In Paris, Frances is given a hat decorated with a rose as a signal for their first contact, who silently instructs them to go to a caf√© in Montmartre. An unseen contact plants a tourist guidebook to southern Germany in Richard's coat. The couple notice a series of ink dots on a map in the book, which, linked together, form a musical staff with the opening notes to the song \\"My Love Is Like a Red, Red Rose.\\" They deduce this is their password. Three pinpricks in the same map direct them to the book's seller, A. Werner (Felix Bressart), in Salzburg. Werner instructs them to go to a certain museum. There a man named Count Hassert Seidel (Conrad Veidt), calling himself a \\"guide,\\" suggests that they check into a guest house run by Frau Kleist (Johanna Hofer). She provides them with a book on Franz Liszt with annotations that reveal their next stop should be the village of Pertisau in the Tyrol, where they should inquire about a doctor who collects chess pieces. Some days later, the couple intends to go to a performance of Liszt but are advised against it by Thornley (Bruce Lester), a fellow houseguest and recent graduate of Oxford. They go anyway. During the passage that Thornley had been practicing earlier, a Nazi colonel, the Commandant of Dachau concentration camp, is shot and killed. Officials insist on questioning each member of the audience. Richard and Frances are rescued by Gestapo Chief Count Sig von Aschenhausen (Basil Rathbone), a former Oxford schoolmate of Richard's. Thornley later tells Richard that he killed the Nazi colonel as revenge for the torture and murder of his Austrian fianc√©e. He also warns Richard that he and his fianc√©e had also once been \\"above suspicion.\\" Frances and Richard go to the home of chess collector, Dr. Mespelbrunn (Reginald Owen). While he does not appear, Count von Aschenhausen does. They notice sheet music for \\"My Love Is Like a Red, Red Rose\\" on the piano. But when Sig fails to respond to a code signal that Richard gives him, the couple becomes suspicious. They hear thumping noises upstairs and discover that Sig is holding Mespelbrunn prisoner. Mespelbrunn tells them to run and says they are being hunted by the Gestapo. The couple leaves the house just in time, and Count Seidel arrives to help them free Mespelbrunn. He is revealed as the missing scientist \\"Dr. Smith\\". All four head for Innsbruck, and Mespelbrunn gives Richard the plans for the countermeasure. The couple obtain counterfeit passports from an elderly couple named Schultz. They are planning to catch the train to Milan at separate stations; but, when the Schultzes are arrested by the Gestapo, the police are on the lookout for the Americans. Frances is detained and questioned by the Gestapo; but Thornley, in Innsbruck to catch the same train, finds Richard. Richard, Thornley, and Seidel gain entry to where Frances is being held and kill her captors, including Sig; but Thornley is also killed. After fooling the Nazi border guards, Seidel and the American newlyweds reach freedom in Italy.

Smith picked up his nickname when he played on the same line as Ray \\"Nod\\" Powell for the Omaha Knights following World War II. His brother Dalton \\"Nakina\\" Smith, played with him on many occasions throughout his career. Professional career Minor league hockey Smith was small in size, but more than made up for it with his stellar play on the ice. After spending time with the St. Michael's Majors in the junior league of the OHA he began play for the Oshawa G-Men of the senior league in the 1935‚Äì36 season. He continued to excel on the ice and was finally noticed after a stellar season in which he scored 30 points in just 18 games. Smith was contacted by the Detroit Red Wings on his birthday and signed as a free agent just nine days later. He was to begin play for the Wings in their farm system, starting with the Detroit Holzbaugh Ford of the Michigan-Ontario Hockey Association in the 1939‚Äì40 season. After starting on a point per game pace for the first 31 games of the season, Smith was brought up to the Wichita Skyhawks of the American Hockey Association. However his time with the Skyhawks was short as the team was disbanded after finishing in last place and Smith ended up on the first place St. Louis Flyers and playing for the first time with his brother, Dalton. Smith and his brother helped keep the Flyers in first place for the next two years, including helping them win the Harry F. Sinclair Trophy, given to the league champions, in 1940‚Äì41. For the 1942‚Äì43 season, Smith finally made the jump to the American Hockey League along with Dalton to begin play for the New Haven Eagles, but end the season playing for the Buffalo Bisons, all while scoring 38 points. He also helped lead the Bisons to win the AHL championship and the Calder Cup with his 9 playoff points. Playing in the NHL Finally in 1943, while having begun play for the Indianapolis Capitols (again reuniting with his brother), the Smith brothers were called up to play for the Detroit Red Wings of the NHL. Carl contributed a goal and an assist in seven games, but still found himself back down in the minors. He finished out the season with the Capitols and ended up with another point per game season. In 1944‚Äì45, Smith again joined the St. Louis Flyers and ended with 10 goals and 26 assists. For the 1945‚Äì46 season, Smith made the jump to the United States Hockey League (USHL), after a short stint with the Capitols again, and joined play for the Omaha Knights. He was an instant success scoring 29 goals and 67 points in 54 games to lead the team in scoring. He was named to the USHL First All-Star Team. He also chipped in three goals in the Knights playoff run, losing to the Kansas City Pla-mors. The following season the Knights acquired Nelson Boyce who would befriend Smith and form a strong scoring duo that would stay together for the next two years. They spent so much time together, the pair became known as Blinky and Winky to teammates and fans. After two more successful seasons with the Knights, and two more postseason losses to the Pla-mors, Smith decided to retire from playing ice hockey at the end of the 1948‚Äì49 season.

He was a son of Count Wichmann the Elder and his wife Frederuna,Reuter, 155. probably a sister of Queen Matilda. The cousin of Emperor Otto I became known as a fierce enemy of the ruling Ottonian dynasty. Wichmann was perhaps born at present-day Wichmannsburg, part of Bienenb√ºttel, at the residence of his father. Wichmann I the Elder, though the first-born of three Billung brothers and by his marriage related to King Otto I, was ignored at the enfeoffment with the Saxon Billung March, which in 936 fell to his younger brother Hermann. Wichmann the Elder at first rebelled against the king, joining the uprising of Duke Eberhard of Franconia, but gave up soon afterwards. Upon his father's death in 944, Wichmann the Younger remained under the tutelage of his uncle Hermann. When he came of age, he was only able to succeed to the rank of a count in Angria, though his county is unknown. Raised at the court of King Otto I upon the early death of their mother, Wichmann made friends with the king's son Liudolf, duke of Swabia since 950. In 953 he participated in Liudolf's rebellion against King Otto,Bernhardt, 24. fighting the Saxon troops during the king's siege of Mainz, whereby he re-opened his father's feud with Hermann, his uncle, who meanwhile had been appointed princeps of Saxony. Wichmann was captured; Otto prevented him from being punished more severely, contrary to Hermann's wishes.Bernhardt, 25. Reuter, 155-156. He was released in 954, though he was not included in the general settlement that followed the revolt.Reuter, 160. Wichmann and his brother Egbert the One-Eyed, still feeling deprived of their heritage, marauded through Saxony and in 955 arrived in the lands of the Slavic Obotrites at Liubice (L√ºbeck), where they instigated a revolt under Prince Nako that was suppressed by King Otto at the Battle of Recknitz. The young Billungs fled to the court of Duke Hugh the Great of France. When Hugh died the next year, Wichmann had to return to Germany; he was however pardoned after he had sworn loyalty to King Otto. He remained an implacable opponent, attacking the lands of his uncle Hermann several times, until he had to retreat to the Slavic Lutici territories, where he was tolerated by Margrave Gero. In 963, Wichmann was an outlaw leading a band of West Slavs (likely Pomeranians) in battle against Duke Mieszko I of Poland, defeating him twice and even exacting tribute. For a brief interlude, he was allowed to return to Germany and his wife's estates, but he was exiled once more by his uncle Hermann during Otto's second Italian campaign. In 967, he and the western Pomeranians were defeated at Wolin by an alliance of Mieszko and Duke Boleslaus I of Bohemia and Wichmann was killed in action. Wichmann's lands were confiscated by Otto and divided in two, half going to the monastery of Saint Michael founded by Hermann Billung at L√ºneburg, and half going to found the convent of Keminada (near Bodenwerder) on the Weser.Bernhardt, 208. Marriage and issue According to the Res gestae saxonicae, Wichmann was married. Certain scholars have interpreted a clause in the foundation charter of the Corvey Abbey as referring to Wichmann, his wife Hathwig, and his son Amelung, Count of Bikethop. Wichmann's daughters Imma and Frederuna were allowed to use their inheritance, on which Keminada was founded, throughout their lifetime. Sources *Reuter, Timothy.

It was the first appearance by the Rangers in the Finals and was their first victory of the Stanley Cup in only their second season. This was the second Stanley Cup victory by an American team, the first being the Seattle Metropolitans in the 1917 Stanley Cup Finals. It was also the first of only two times that a Montreal-based team would lose the Stanley Cup clinching game at the Montreal Forum. Paths to the Finals The Montreal Maroons defeated the Ottawa Senators in the quarter-finals total-goals series 3‚Äì1. The Maroons then defeated the Montreal Canadiens in the semi-finals total-goals series 3‚Äì2 to reach the Finals. The New York Rangers defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates in the quarter-finals total-goals series 6‚Äì4. The Rangers then defeated the Boston Bruins in the semi-finals total-goals series 5‚Äì2 to reach the Finals. Game summaries The series had to be played in Montreal, as the circus had taken over New York's Madison Square Garden. The Rangers lost their goalie Lorne Chabot to an eye injury in the second period of Game 2. Although goaltenders Alex Connell and Hugh McCormick were in the stands, the Maroons refused to allow the Rangers to use either goalie. In one of the most famous incidents in hockey history, 44-year-old coach Lester Patrick took over with the recorded words \\"Boys, don't let an old man down,\\" and his efforts inspired the Rangers to a 2‚Äì1 victory in overtime. At 44 years, 99 days old, Patrick became the oldest man to play in the Stanley Cup Finals, a record which remains unsurpassed to this day (Chris Chelios in 2008 at the age of 46 became the oldest player with his name on the cup, though he did not log any ice time in the final). He entered with 8 minutes remaining in the second period and played the final 35 minutes, 5 seconds of the game. For the following matches, the Rangers hired New York Americans goalie Joe Miller, who won two games including a shutout. Miller was available to all NHL teams as a backup after the Americans had put him on waivers. The Boston Bruins had claimed him on waivers, but he was made available to any NHL team. At the time of the Final, Miller had not played in four weeks, and was home in Ottawa. Miller was cut and suffered two black eyes in game five, but hung on for a 2‚Äì1 victory.

He was best known for design and construction of the world's first operationally successful mainline diesel locomotive, the E el-2. This was completed in 1924 and went into service in 1925.Heywood, p.209 In the late 1920s, Lomonosov immigrated to Europe and later became a British citizen. Early years Lomonosov was born in 1876 in Gzhatsk (now Gagarin), a town in Smolensk Oblast of Russia. His father Vladimir Grigorievich Lomonosov was a former cavalry officer who worked as a judge since 1870.

Lomonosov ‚Äì the first Soviet and world's diesel locomotive\\" History of Science and Technology, 1985, No. 4, in Russian).Heywood, p.38 In 1887, following the family tradition, Lomonosov entered the Moscow 1st Cadet Corps. However, he then decided to abandon his military career in favor of engineering. In 1893, Lomonosov passed the entrance exam and started his studies at the St. Petersburg Institute of Communications. After graduation, he worked at Kharkiv Locomotive Plant and then, in October 1898, became assistant director of the depot of the Kharkiv-Nikolayev railways. In 1898, he started designing and testing locomotives that became his occupation of his life. In 1899, he was offered a teaching position at the Warsaw Polytechnic Institute where he taught a course on the theory and management of locomotives. In the meantime, the Russian Ministry of Communications approved him for the position of Inspector of the Russian State and Private Railways. Personal life In May 1897, Lomonosov married Sofya Alexandrovna Antonovich, a daughter of railway constructor A. I. Antonovich. On their honeymoon, the couple visited Germany, Belgium, Britain and Sweden. Their relations became cold toward 1907 when Sophia Alexandrovna went to Switzerland to study medicine, taking their children with her. Her departure put an end to their marriage. Lomonosov's secretary Raisa Rosen took care of his home and later in August 1908 became his wife.Heywood, p.155 They had a son Yuri who was born in Nikopol and worked most of his life in Britain. Work in Kiev In 1902, Lomonosov became professor of the Kiev Polytechnic Institute. Later, with a group of 100 students he was sent to inspect the Chinese Eastern Railways (CER) for the purpose of their reconstruction. During the trip, he visited numerous cities of the Far East including Irkutsk, Harbin, Port Arthur, Vladivostok, as well as some cities in Japan (Nagasaki) and China (Beijing). The results of the expedition were partly reported in a meeting with the Minister of Finances Sergei Witte, with whom Lomonosov openly talked about theft and corruption at the CER. This meeting reinforced the image of Lomonosov as an honest and uncompromising public official. During his stay at Kiev Polytechnic Institute, Lomonosov joined the rapidly growing socialist movement and became an avid Marxist. He however, did not join the Communist Party that hindered many of his further appointments after the October Revolution. As inspector at the Russian Railways, Lomonosov often traveled abroad to get acquainted with experience of the organization of transport in other countries. In November 1902, he attended the International Congress of Railway Transport Engineers, held in Vienna, where he became acquainted with the work of Austrian and Hungarian engineers. In the spring of 1903, he also visited Italy, Switzerland, France and Spain. In April 1905, Lomonosov defended his habilitation on the dynamics of locomotives and became the youngest full professor of the institute. In December 1907, he was appointed head of the locomotive section of St. Catherine's railroads. During this period, he became convinced of the futility of steam engines and concluded that the future belongs to the more fuel-efficient locomotives with internal combustion engines. In 1909, he started to design the engine-oil tankers with a friction-based transmission (from the diesel engine to the driving axle). In July 1914, the Ministry of Railways has approved his design and allocated funds for the production of 2 locomotives, but the project was halted by World War I. During these years, Lomonosov became a recognized authority in the field of locomotive equipment in Russia and headed a department at the Kiev Polytechnic Institute. He had launched the theory of traction locomotives and developed the scientific basis for the exploitation of railways that was summarized in 2 books published in 1912: \\"Traction calculation and application of graphic methods to them\\", and \\"Scientific problems of railway operation \\". Together with his students, in 1908 Lomonosov formed the first research institution devoted to locomotives ‚Äì \\"The office of the experimentation over the types of engines\\", which was converted after the October Revolution to the \\"Experimental Institute of Communications\\". In Soviet Russia The –Æ—ç 001 locomotive In June 1917, the Provisional Government sent Lomonosov to the U.S. diplomatic mission, as a representative of the Ministry of Railways. There he learned about the October Revolution in Russia. In Autumn 1919, he returned to Russia because the Americans decided to suspend their sales of engines to the Soviet Russia. In November 1920, Lomonosov was appointed to the Council of People's Commissars as responsible for rail orders abroad. In this function, he went to Berlin where in 1920‚Äì1923 he had organized the purchase of German and Swedish locomotives for Russia.Heywood, p.70 In 2001 A. A. Igolkin suggested that in the winter of 1919‚Äì20 he was responsible for embezzling gold intended for the Algemba railway project. During this time, Lomonosov did not stop his engineering and scientific activities. From 1923 to 1924 he took on a task of creating the first Russian diesel engine with electric transmission. Using his administrative skills, Lomonosov assembled a creative team of engineers and scientists who managed to design and build a prototype as early as in Spring 1924. The locomotive passed all State tests and examinations and in February 1925 was officially listed under number –Æ—ç 001 at the Soviet railways. Although several other prototype designs were constructed much earlier and in different countries, this locomotive is considered as the world's first operationally successful mainline diesel locomotive. Life abroad Between 1924 and 1925, Lomonosov lived and worked in Berlin, sending reports on his communications with German locomotive plants. Despite being recognized as the father of the first Russian diesel locomotive, his popularity among the Soviet politicians had declined. During this period, Lomonosov decided not to return to the Soviet Union. He continued publishing books and began working as consultant and a teacher. Several factors, including insufficient knowledge of German and English, his relatively low popularity and Soviet origin, hindered his professional employment since then ‚Äì Lomonosov hardly ever regained the popularity and work possibilities which he had had in Russia. Between 1927 and 1948, he moved around several countries in Europe and the United States, taking various temporal positions and projects. In Britain, he collaborated with a talented physicist Pyotr Kapitsa; in particular, they unsuccessfully tried to obtain a patent on an electromechanical brake system of a locomotive. In 1938, Lomonosov and his wife Raisa took British citizenship. In 1948‚Äì1950, together with his son Yuri, he went to the U.S. to visit friends and then moved to Canada, where he died after a brief illness.Heywood, p.223 References Bibliography *Heywood, Anthony, Modernising Lenin's Russia: Economic Reconstruction, Foreign Trade, and the Railways, 1917‚Äì1924.

History  According to local tradition, former slave Butcher Christian, his former master, Gideon Christian, and noted post-Civil War church organizer, the Rev. John Baptist, established the Shiloh Baptist Church in 1871. Services began in a log sanctuary located on donated by Butcher Christian. A school for African Americans operated there until the 1890s. An adjacent cemetery with marked graves dating to 1882 is still active. Revenue from oil discovered on church land was used to build a new sanctuary on this site in 1936. Shiloh Baptist Church still serves the community with a variety of programs. The First Presbyterian Church was organized in Shiloh, Gregg County, Texas in 1838, but relocated to Clarksville in 1844. The newly freed African Americans of the Shiloh Community established a school for their children shortly after the Civil War. The one-room building was demolished in the late 19th century and classes were held at the Shiloh Baptist Church. With financial assistance from the Julius Rosenwald Fund, a new two-room school was erected in 1920. It was replaced by a large brick building in the 1930s. The High School was closed in 1949; the end of segregation closed the rest of the Shiloh School in 1966. Shiloh graduates became contributing citizens in Texas and the nation. Long vacant, the school building was later used to store chemicals for a plastics company, and burned in 1993.

John Augustus Walker The commission was assigned to John Augustus Walker, a well- known Mobile artist who had previously completed WPA-related art assignments. A founder of the Mobile Art Guild and an Alabama Gulf Coast native, Walker is known not only for his paintings and murals, which are found in private collections and in public buildings across Alabama and the Gulf Coast, but also for his work designing Mardi Gras floats, costumes and stage exhibits.\\"John Augustus Walker,\\" A Presentation of the Alabama Cooperative Extension System, Auburn University Sesquicentennial. Purpose The murals, which illustrate key periods of Alabama's agricultural development starting with Native Americans, are among the most valued artifacts associated with Alabama Extension's almost century-long association with agriculture. The murals also are considered prime examples of WPA-related art associated with the Great Depression era. Walker originally was commissioned to paint 29 murals for the exhibition, all of which were supposed to depict farm life from Alabama's agricultural past. However, due to time constraints, he managed to complete only ten. The project was one of several funded during the period by the WPA to support talented young arts such as Walker, aged 37 at the time, and to encourage continued interest in the arts during and immediately following the Depression.\\"Historical Panorama of Alabama Agriculture,\\" Alabama Cooperative Extension Service (Undated publication from the 1980s exhibition at Foy Union Student Union Gallery, Auburn University). The murals were designed as much for their educational impact as their aesthetic appeal. Laying out the purpose for the paintings, then-Alabama Extension Director P. O. Davis noted that \\"agriculture in Alabama, and in this nation, is in a period of change ‚Äî a change toward improvement and progress.\\" Originally intended to depict an impoverished \\"one-armed Confederate\\" veteran working in a soil-eroded field, this painting represented the antithesis of everything farming was supposed to be in the 20th century. All of the elements included in the painting were intended to underscore this fact - a dilapidated plantation house, highly eroded cropland soil, a farming operation exclusively dependent on cotton, and a wagon loaded with supplies that should have been produced on the farm.Alabama, Davis stressed, was diversifying, moving from a primarily cotton-based economy \\"into a combination of cotton and other cash crops plus livestock and poultry.\\" He envisioned these murals and the supporting fair exhibits not only as a celebration of the past but also as a means of focusing farmers on a \\"vision of the future.\\" \\"It [the panorama] will reveal also that Alabama agriculture is not only changing and improving but that it is geared to go forward in a big way and in terms of efficiency and economy,\\" Davis wrote. In this sense, Davis viewed the murals as yet another form of educational communication that had distinguished previous Extension efforts ‚Äî a means for \\"guiding farmers as to what to do and how to do it.\\"Davis, P.O., Director, Alabama Extension Service, Alabama Polytechnic Institute, \\"Our Agriculture and Our Fair,\\" (An Outline of Purposes for the Historical Panorama of Alabama Agriculture Exhibition at the State Fair), Auburn University Libraries, Special Collections and Archives. The catalyst In an era when many forms of mass communication were still in their infancy, state fairs were considered a prime venue for this type of educational outreach. Indeed, state fairs were big business in the Depression- era Thirties ‚Äî a place where thousands of financially hard-pressed Americans temporarily could forget their economic problems and the troubling portents of war in Europe. Agricultural exhibits were a mainstay of these state fairs. According to Bruce Dupree, an Alabama Cooperative Extension System art specialist and Walker expert, > Fairgoers moved excitedly through poorly lit, unair-conditioned buildings to > view prize-winning livestock, colorful quilts, farm exhibits, baking > contests, and canning demonstrations. In Alabama, each of the state's 67 > counties was given space to showcase local produce and a specific > agricultural industry.Dupree, C. Bruce, Art Specialist, Alabama Cooperative > Extension System, \\"Lecture on Historical Panorama of Alabama Agriculture,\\" > Auburn University Sesquicentennial, September 21, 2006. Managing the large number of entries often proved to be a daunting task for fair planners, leading many of them to consider different strategies for handling these agricultural exhibits. In fact, the Historical Panorama of Alabama Agriculture was conceived as one such new strategy. The panorama was the brainchild of fair vice president Warren Leech, who wanted to develop a radically different and more effective way to showcase Alabama agriculture by combining all of these separate county exhibits into one agricultural show. Leech paid a visit to Alabama Extension Service Director P. O. Davis in Auburn to discuss his ideas. Davis quickly grasped this opportunity, seeing it as a way to highlight the role served by the Alabama Extension Service and the Alabama Polytechnic Institute (now Auburn University) in advancing the state's food and fiber sector. Planning rural electrification. Davis and other Alabama Extension administrators apparently invested full confidence in Walker's artist abilities. In an \\"Informal Report on Alabama Pageant of Agriculture Exhibit\\" submitted to Davis in May 1939, the project was described as being \\"in good hands\\" and was predicted to be \\"unusually successful.\\" Moreover, Extension employees dispatched to Mobile to consult with Walker reported to Davis that they were confident that panorama would \\"present Alabama agriculture in a most interesting way\\" and that \\"the entire series, especially if they are properly interpreted, should make a very strong impression on those who see it.\\" Alabama Extension project planners also were impressed with the price associated with the commission. The sponsors reasoned that with the WPA underwriting, they were getting a series of murals with a market value of $6,000 for \\"approximately the cost of materials involved.\\"Baldwin, H.T., \\"Informal Report on the Alabama Pageant of Agriculture Exhibit,\\" Report by Baldwin, U.S. Department of Agriculture employee to P. O. Davis, Alabama Extension Service Director, May 18, 1939, Auburn University Libraries, Special Collections and Archives. Another mural extolling the virtues of farm diversification, depicting livestock and row crops raised side by side.Even so, these planners were unwilling to defer solely to Walker's talents and exercised creative oversight throughout the course of the project. Davis and other Alabama Extension employees involved with the project expressed concerns about historical accuracy, however inaccurate some of their historical views may have been. For example, in a letter dated April 18, 1939, Alabama Extension Agricultural Editor Donald Robertson instructed the Walker to replace the male depicted in a proposed sketch about Native American agricultural life with a female, because \\"according to Indian Legend, the women did most of the field work while the men did the hunting and 'took life easy.'\\"\\"Letter to J.A. Walker from Donald L. Robertson, Alabama Extension Service Agricultural Editor,\\" April 18, 1939, Auburn University Libraries, Special Collections and Archives. Along with other detailed suggestions, Robertson also suggested another picture that would depict \\"the arrival of women folks on the farm and perhaps one or two children to show the beginning of a well-rounded farm family.\\" Walker probably never expected the level of intense scrutiny from Auburn that would accompany design and planning of the murals and the supporting exhibits. Not only Walker's Extension Service sponsors but also U.S. Department of Agriculture employees became intimately involved in the planning, offering detailed instructions even for the selection and placement of the objects for display in the foreground of the murals. For example, each mural was to have a drapery border and a table in front of it filled with produce, farm implements, or household items that would complete the artwork. Another depiction of how Alabama was changing as a result of the application of sound agricultural and domestic practices promoted by Cooperative Extension and the land-grant university.\\"The objects should be 100 percent pertinent to the stage of development represented by the mural,\\" according to instructions provided by H.T. Baldwin, an employee with the Extension Exhibits Division of the USDA, one of several communications professionals who traveled throughout the country providing advice to state Extension services and providing quality control for Cooperative Extension-related visuals projects. Baldwin also advised placing more objects in the foreground to relieve Walker of detailed painting. Due to lighting constraints, he also recommended that Walker use dull-finish colors rather than oils, which would create a shiny surface. Moreover, he suggested that Walker include descriptive signage to help visitors \\"absorb\\" the information of all episodes. Baldwin also recommended that the interior elements of the hall be painted in API's school colors. The effort placed immense physical and mental strain on Walker, who, in addition to managing the demands of a day job, also was contending with a serious family illness at the time.\\"Letter to Miss Mary Weber, Director, Division of Women's and Professional Projects, Montgomery, Alabama from J.A. Walker,\\" May 9, 1959, Auburn University Libraries, Special Collections and Archives. With only three weeks remaining before the fair's opening, Walker worked feverishly to complete the task, even though by then, the project had been scaled down to 10 murals. The artist was also given full authority to purchase any materials needed to complete the exhibit and to fill the space made vacant by the 10 unfinished paintings. He ordered 40 new spotlights, more than 600 yards of curtain-like fabric, hundreds of feet of rope, and all the crepe paper he could find to cover the exhibit hall ceiling. John A. Walker's pass to the 1939 Alabama State Fair.The murals ended up approximately 7.5 feet by 5.5 feet with dry color on unbleached canvas. Also, because the murals were intended to last only for the duration of the fair, Walker painted them with tempera, a water-based and less durable medium, rather than his preferred medium of oils. Fair The fair and the panorama turned out to be well-attended, highly successful undertakings. Record crowds filled the midway, grandstand, and exhibit halls throughout the day and night. Then-Governor Frank Dixon praised the fair and the planning that preceded it, describing the fair as \\"the best ever and a model for the entire nation to see.\\" The fair also garnered front- page news coverage for five consecutive days, apparently filling the role fairs typically served during this era ‚Äî diverting a weary state from its economic woes and concerns about the looming conflict in Europe . Moreover, the agriculture and industry exhibits appeared to generate more public interest than the rides and games. Aftermath Immediately following the Alabama State Fair, the murals were packed and shipped to Shreveport, Louisiana, for display at the Louisiana State Fair, held October 21‚Äì30, 1939.U.S. Department of Agriculture, Extension Service, Division of Exhibits, October 4, 1939. Sometime thereafter, the murals were taken to Auburn University and stored in Duncan Hall, the state headquarters of the Alabama Extension Service, where they remained basically undisturbed for the next 45 years until they were rediscovered in the early 1980s. They were subsequently refurbished and displayed in Foy Student Union on the Auburn University campus. Following their rediscovery, at least one Walker admirer advocated purchasing the murals from Auburn University and returning them to the artist's native Mobile.Tatum, Jr., Gordon, \\"Let's Buy Murals Back,\\" Mobile Press-Register, (Date Unavailable), Auburn University Libraries, Special Collections and Archives. However, they remained in Auburn. In fact, as part of Auburn University's sesquicentennial celebration in 2006, the Alabama Cooperative Extension System, through Dupree's efforts, reintroduced the paintings after more than 20 years with a public lecture and display in the Foy Union Student Union Gallery. The son and grandchildren of the late artist were on hand for the lecture and exhibition to greet attendees and to answer questions.

He was murdered in the 1962 riot at the University of Mississippi while covering the events surrounding James Meredith's attempts to enroll at the all-white university. The only journalist known to have been killed in the backlash to the Civil Rights Movement, his murder remains unsolved. Early life Guihard was born in London in 1931, the son of an English mother and a French father, both of whom worked in the hotel industry. He had a brother, Alain Guihard. He was a dual citizen of France and the United Kingdom. In 1935, his parents purchased London's Rhodesia Court Hotel, and sent the three-year-old Guihard to stay with his grandparents in France while they attended to the new business. He remained in Saint-Malo until the end of World War II, and at fourteen returned to his parents in London. There he attended the French Lyc√©e and the University of London, where he earned a degree in international affairs.Wickham, p. 103. Guihard was always interested in writing and found part-time work with Agence France-Presse (AFP) while in his teens, covering the 1948 London Olympics for the agency. His dedication to his work earned him the nickname \\"Flash\\".Wickham, p. 104. At 19 he joined the British Army, serving at the Suez Canal. He joined Agence France-Presse full time in 1953 after his discharge. AFP transferred him to its English-speaking desk in Paris in 1959 and assigned him to the New York office the following year. In New York Guihard chiefly worked as an editor, also occasionally contributing stories for AFP and freelancing for London's Daily Sketch. He also wrote plays, including \\"The Deck Chair\\", which was performed in New York and later adapted into French for several performances in France. University of Mississippi assignment and death On 30 September 1962, AFP assigned Guihard to cover the developing story of James Meredith's enrollment at the University of Mississippi, the first time an African-American enrolled at the school. As an editor, Guihard infrequently went out on assignment, and did not regularly cover the Civil Rights beat; in fact Guihard had the day off. However, the agency was short staffed and felt the story needed to be covered, and so called in Guihard and photographer Sammy Schulman to go to Mississippi. That morning, Guihard and Schulman flew from New York to Jackson, Mississippi via Atlanta. They found a tense atmosphere in which the federal government was prepared to use force to ensure Meredith's enrollment despite the attempts of governor Ross Barnett and local segregationists to keep him out. Guihard and Schulman visited the governor's office, where the Citizens' Council had organized a segregationist rally. They then visited the local Citizens' Council headquarters to interview executive director Louis Hollis. The meeting was friendly and Guihard received Hollis' permission to file a story from the office; this 198-word piece, Guihard's last, called the situation \\"the gravest Constitutional crisis that the United States has known since the War of Secession\\" and asserted that the \\"Civil War never came to an end\\".Wickham, pp. 103‚Äì105. Guihard and Schulman then drove north to Oxford, Mississippi, home of the University of Mississippi. While en route, they heard President John F. Kennedy's speech indicating that federal agents had already escorted Meredith to campus. Assuming the story was over, they continued on to Oxford to clear up the details. When they arrived, at around 8:40 p.m., however, they learned that rioting had started on campus. Parking near The Grove, Guihard and Shulman split up to avoid being identified as journalists and targeted by the mob, agreeing to meet back up an hour later. Guihard headed toward the riot gathering at the Lyceum and Circle areas of campus, while Shulman circled the Grove. Life photographer Flip Schulke saw Guihard heading toward the riot and tried to stop him, but Guihard refused, saying, \\"I'm not worried, I was in Cyprus.\\" This may have been the last time anyone spoke to Guihard.Wickham, pp. 105‚Äì106. A bench on the University of Mississippi campus dedicated to Guihard Guihard was shot in an unlit area at the southeast corner of the Ward Dormitory between 8 and 9 p.m. His body was found by students just east of the dormitory at 9 p.m. The students attempted to revive him and sought help, but were not immediately certain what had happened to him; they initially believed he had suffered cardiac arrest from the tear gas. The riot exacerbated matters, as ambulances could not get through the crowd to assist. Eventually, the students were able to get a car to the area and took Guihard to Oxford Hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival.Wickham, pp. 106‚Äì107. The hospital determined that he had been killed by \\"a gunshot wound to the back that penetrated the heart\\". The hospital sent Guihard's body to a nearby funeral home, where Schulman made the identification.Wickham, pp. 107‚Äì108. He was the only journalist murdered during the Civil Rights Era.Wickham, p. 102. The Federal Bureau of Investigation handled the initial investigation with assistance from local authorities.Wickham, pp. 108‚Äì109. Sheriff Joe Ford surmised that the shooter had attacked Guihard either knowing he was a journalist, or mistaking him as a protester, and had certainly intended to kill him.Wickham, p. 108. Guihard may have stood out from the crowd due to his large frame, red hair and distinctive red goatee, and potentially his foreign accent.Wickham, pp. 105, 108. The investigation never identified a suspect and the case remained unsolved.Wickham, p. 109. Memorials A plaque on the University of Mississippi campus memorializing Guihard's death in 1989, Paul Guihard's name was included in the Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, Alabama, memorializing 40 people who lost their lives in the struggle for civil rights. Twenty years later a memorial plaque was unveiled by representatives of the University of Mississippi and from AFP, a short distance from where his body was found. Some 150 students and teachers from the school of journalism participated in the ceremony.\\"Hommage √† un journaliste AFP assassin√© lors d'une √©meute raciale aux Etats-Unis\\", La D√©p√™che du Midi, April 18, 2009.

He served as Chancellor of Austria from 1961 to 1964. Life Born in Imst, Tyrol, Gorbach served in the Austro- Hungarian Army at the Italian Front in World War I, was severely wounded in the 1917 Battle of Caporetto and lost a leg. After the war he took up a political career in the First Austrian Republic. He joined the Christian Social Party and from 1929 to 1932 was a municipal councillor in Graz, Styria. In 1937 he was appointed a minister (Landesrat) in the Styrian state government, However, upon the Austrian Anschluss to Nazi Germany in March 1938, Gorbach was dismissed and held as a political prisoner at Dachau concentration camp from 1938‚Äì42, and again at Flossenburg from 1944 until the end of World War II. After the war, Gorbach joined the newly established Austrian People's Party, and upon the 1945 legislative election became a president of the National Council parliament, an office he held until 1953 and again from 1956 to 1961. When a deceiving outcome in the 1959 election launched an internal party debate over aging √ñVP Chancellor Julius Raab, Gorbach, backed by the Styrian regional association, succeeded him as party chairman and on 11 April 1961 also as Austrian chancellor. Chancellor Gorbach led his party into the 1962 election with an anti-Socialist campaign, only to continue the grand coalition with the SP√ñ under Vice-Chancellor Bruno Pittermann afterwards. The People's Party achieved a slightly better result and became the strongest party five seats ahead of the Socialists, however, it failed to reach an absolute majority. After three years as chancellor, conciliatory Gorbach had to vacate his position in favour of the less pragmatic √ñVP \\"reformers\\" around his successor Josef Klaus. He returned to the National Council where he kept his mandate until 1970. In 1965 he unsuccessfully ran against Franz Jonas in the Austrian presidential election. Gorbach remained honorary chairman of the Austrian People's Party. He died in Graz, Styria, aged 73.

It was operated by the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces and closed at the end of 2012. The radar station had a range of up to , and was designed to detect missile launches as far as the Indian Ocean. The radar's surveillance covered Iran, Turkey, India, Iraq and the entire Middle East. It could detect the launch of missiles and track the whole trajectory to enable a ballistic missile defense system to intercept an offensive strike. The Radar Station hosted about 1,000 Russian servicemen with about 500 Azerbaijanis. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation and Azerbaijan negotiated the terms of the lease and in 2002 the two countries signed an agreement according to which Russia leased the station from Azerbaijan until 24 December 2012 for $7 million per year rent, $5 million per year for electricity and $10 million per year for other services. In 2012 the future of the station was being negotiated between Russia and Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan and Armenia have ongoing tension and Russia and Armenia are close. Both Armenia and Azerbaijan are members of the CIS but only Armenia is a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation. Russia has a new Voronezh radar in Armavir which covers the same region as Gabala. Russia offered to modernise the station and Azerbaijan wanted to increase the rent Russia paid, from $7m to $300m according to one source. In December 2012, Russia announced that negotiations had been unsuccessful and that they had stopped using the radar station.

It consists of two separate large phased-array antennas separated by around to . The transmitter array is and the receiver is in size. The system is a VHF system operating at a wavelength of 1.5 to 2 meters (150 to 200 MHz). Its initial transmit capacity was 50 MW with a target capacity of 350 MW. Originally, at least seven Daryal facilities were planned, however, only the first two facilities completed, Pechora and Gabala, were ever operational. Two Daryal-U type were to be built at sites in Balkhash and Mishelevka, Irkutsk, neither were completed. The US Clinton administration offered financial assistance in completing the Mishelevka facility in exchange for amending the ABM treaty to allow US deployment of a national missile defense system. Russia rejected this proposal and in 2002 the US unilaterally withdrew from the ABM treaty. Two Daryal-UM systems were to be constructed in Skrunda, Latvia and Mukachevo, Ukraine. The Mukachevo in the Ukraine was never completed after the fall of the Soviet Union and the Skrunda facility was turned over to Latvia to be demolished. The Yeniseysk (Krasnoyarsk) Daryal-U site caused concern in the west over compliance with the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty during its construction in the 1980s. Following years of negotiations, in September 1989 the Soviets admitted it was a violation of the treaty, construction ceased and the facility was eventually dismantled. Strategic Importance of Gabala During the 33rd G8 summit in Germany on June 7‚Äì8, 2007, Russian president Vladimir Putin made an offer to deploy elements of an American anti-ballistic missile system in Azerbaijan, instead of Poland (see US missile defense complex in Poland) and the Czech Republic, using the Gabala Radar Station jointly with Russia. This offer came after the debate about the U.S. plan to deploy anti-ballistic missile system components in Eastern Europe to defend against possible ballistic missile attacks from Iran and North Korea. The plan met with sharp criticism by Russia which threatened to target Europe with its own ballistic missiles despite US claims that the system was not designed to defend against a large scale Russian attack. The Gabala radar is used as a sensor for the A-135 ABM system which Russia has operated in Europe, near Moscow, since the 1970s. In the beginning of July 2007 the US announced that the Gabala installation was not an acceptable substitute for the Poland and Czech Republic sites. In July 2007 at a Kennebunkport summit Russia offered data from Armavir too. Russia says that Gabala identified 150 launches of scud missiles during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War and has been watching Iranian missile launches. Data from Gabala, together with Armavir, was offered to the United States as they provide good coverage of any potential launches from Iran. Environmental concerns There were reports about environmental damage from the activity of Gabala Radar Station which sparked some public debate in Azerbaijan. Similar health concerns were raised about American PAVE PAWS phased array radars, but as of 2005 available data did not support those concerns. Surveys undertaken by the Radiation Problems Institute of the Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources have not found anything abnormal. Some sources say that the station occupies about , however the Russian military say . Opponents of the station say that another 400 hectares of forest were cut down while laying transmission lines to service the station and that the underground water level has fallen sharply after 16 boreholes were drilled to supply water to the station's cooling system. Every hour of cooling station requires about 300‚Äì400 cubic meters of water, after which the water without any treatment is discharged into a river. Because of falling groundwater surrounding forests are dying. Many species of fish in the river disappeared. The local population continues to use water from the river The newspaper Baku Zerkalo reports that in 1984, when the power was 300 MW, of one hectare of land was completely burnt out. In other instances of sources of ignition for trees on the radiation meter range is not described, such fires do not occur when operating a similar radar in Pechora and comparable to the power of the Don-2N radar station in the Moscow suburbs.

It was conceived in the mid-1980s as the keystone of downtown revitalization, though the project was not completed until 1993. Its opening in 1993 was nationally televised on CNN and attended by then-Pennsylvania Governor Robert P. Casey, Sr., who was instrumental in securing funding for and initiating development of the mall. The mall is built on approximately half of the former Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad yard that was abandoned by Conrail in the late 1970s. The mall is located on Lackawanna Avenue in the heart of downtown Scranton, and includes a parking garage that stretches the length of the mall between Boscov's and the former The Bon-Ton. The mall has two levels with a food court overlooking Steamtown National Historic Site on the second floor. There is a pedestrian bridge leading from the food court out to Steamtown. The mall was featured several times on the NBC sitcom The Office which was set in Scranton. History The Mall at Steamtown project was organized by Al Boscov, due to Boscov's being unable to move into Crown American malls after they bought Hess's. Boscov‚Äôs Department Stores and Shopco Advisory Corp developed the mall under the name Scranton Mall Associates. The mall cost $90 million to construct and required the demolition of many buildings which was completed with the implosion of five buildings on April 5, 1992. Prior to the construction, the area had problems with drugs and prostitution. 2000s The Bon-Ton moved to the mall in 2000 from its location at the Keyser Oak Shopping Center. In 2003, Steamtown Mall Partners replaced Scranton Mall Associates as the manager of the mall. The malls owners fought the construction of The Shoppes at Montage and lost in court. 2010s The Bon-Ton closed after the lease expired on January 31, 2014, after 13 years in the mall. They had also leased an additional over two stores on the mall's first floor. American Eagle and ATOS Chicken & Waffles also closed. A replacement store had shown interest, but was delayed due to the foreclosure. No new anchor was in negotiations to replace The Bon-Ton according to Al Boscov. After the foreclosure announcement, As Seen on TV, Cinnabon/Carvel, and Steamtown Pub and Grill also closed. After the sheriff's sale, Express closed in August 2014. Jones Lang LaSalle managed the mall from 2012 until 2014. Part of the parking deck near the former Bon- Ton store had to be closed in 2014 due to degradation. Overall parking was not affected due to the parking garage underneath the mall and the parking deck near Boscov's. Repairs for the parking garages were estimated at $10 million. The Steamtown 8 Cinemas (Marquee Cinemas) did not generate enough revenue to afford the conversion to digital projectors. Operator Marquee did not renew its lease at the end of 2014. Abercrombie & Fitch and Hollister closed in December 2014. Due to the foreclosure and sheriff's sale, The Mall at Steamtown's vacancy is at 75%. Lids and Nathan's Hot Dogs closed in January 2015. The mall considered ending the parking program in January 2015, but kept it active. f.y.e. and The Bodywork Store closed in May 2015. According to Al Boscov, many stores left under the terms of their lease due to the mall only having one remaining anchor store. Foreclosure A $40.5-million mortgage came due on July 11, 2013. The owners were not able to make the payment, and the mall went into foreclosure on March 7, 2014. The Marquee Theater was included in the foreclosure, but not the Oppenheim and Samter buildings. Debt and low rent revenue (at the time of the foreclosure, the mall was only 65 percent occupied), along with competition from The Shoppes at Montage, Viewmont Mall, and online businesses were cited as reasons for the foreclosure. Boscov's department store, whose owner, Al Boscov, was a member of Steamtown Mall Partners, planned to bid for the mall at the auction or purchase it beforehand, but could not reach an agreement. Out of 43 Boscov's locations, the location at Steamtown was the 5th-best performing with annual sales of $31 million. Boscov expressed hope that other mall groups would bid on the mall as they have more resources to fill it. Boscov's continued to renovate its store during the foreclosure. The city of Scranton owes more than $3.6 million in loans that it secured for the mall. Due to a missed payment, $613,000 has been withheld from Scranton by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. Due to accounting issues at the Office of Economic and Community Development in Scranton, $998,000 in payments on the Section 108 loan made from 1999 to 2001 by the mall's owners at the time (Scranton Mall Associates) were not recorded properly. The city of Scranton refinanced the remaining $1,865,000 HUD Section 108 loan in late 2014 and it will be paid over 10 years. Al Boscov donated $715,173 ($612,480 for loan principal and $102,693 in interest) from Boscov‚Äôs Department Stores to Scranton for the missed HUD loan. The money was later added to the cities funds for rebuilding sidewalk curbs. Sheriff‚Äôs sale The sheriff's sale was held on July 15, 2014, with a requested price of over $43.7 million. The reserve price of $37.3 million ($37,265,000) was not met and LNR Partners purchased the property for $1,567.71, its costs and taxes. The only other bidder was a representative for Robert Bolus, whose bid was declared illegal due to the contingency of a casino license being approved for the property. Al Boscov did not bid due to the high requested price and plans to continue negotiations with LNR Partners, but estimates it could take $10‚Äì20 million in investments to modernize the Mall. Zamias Services, Inc. took over management of the mall after the sheriff's sale. 2015 auction LNR Partners was to put The Mall at Steamtown up for auction on auction.com from June 1‚Äì3, 2015 with a starting price of $1 million. The auction was delayed until June 22‚Äì24, 2015 with a lowered starting price of $700,000 to allow for more bids. Concerns about the mall include deferred repairs and parking garage repairs. Boscov's was planning to bid on the mall but also holds veto power in its lease on any major changes. Their lease runs through 2024 and Al Boscov was against converting the mall to a farmers' market and other ideas proposed. The Mall at Steamtown reconstruction (including parking garage) was estimated to cost $33.3 million with money coming from state grants and loans backed by Scranton. Mayor Bill Courtright initially supported the plan, but later came out against it until repayment of $18 million in loans owed to Scranton is complete. The winning bid for The Mall at Steamtown was $5.25 million, with the auction ending a half-hour late due to bidding, and Boscov‚Äôs not the buyer. Announcing who won happened four weeks later due to finalizing of the complex deal. The mall was purchased by John Basalyga for $5,512,500 (total with five percent buyer's premium) from LBUBS 2003-C5 Lackawanna Retail Partnership and operates it under the name Steamtown 300 LLC. The First National Community Bank of Dunmore financed the purchase with a mortgage of $4.2 million. Basalyga has commented that the mall will not be re-purposed at this time. 2016 rebranding In May 2016, Basalyga announced that the mall would be renamed \\"The Marketplace at Steamtown\\". Along with the rebranding, Basalyga announced that one of the former anchor stores would be converted to a Luzerne County Community College satellite campus, and that a movie theatre, a large indoor playground, and a space for local vendors were all expected to open during the summer. The Marketplace remains active and growing to this day, with new stores and businesses joining the retailer. Places of interest include Delta Medix, Luzerne County Community College, Art Haus Cinemas, Electric City Steel Band Project, Crunch Fitness, and many more. An area for local vendors, the Scranton Public Market, opened in late 2017. The public market features eateries and craft sellers from throughout the region, and host many weekend events that attracts thousands of shoppers.

The narrative follows the believer from a state of damnation to a state of grace; the most famous example is perhaps John Bunyan's Grace Abounding (1666). Structure Because so many autobiographies were written, they began to fall into a predictable pattern. The \\"formula\\" began with a sinful youth, \\"followed by a gradual awakening of spiritual feelings and a sense of anxiety about the prospects for one's soul.\\"Spiritual Autobiography. The Literary Encyclopedia. Retrieved on 8 June 2007. The person would repent, fall again into sin, repent, and sin again; such cycles could last for years. The Bible was often a source of comfort or fear during this time. Finally, the person had a conversion experience, an \\"epiphany, often of an emotionally shattering character, by which individuals came to realise that they had been singled out by God for salvation.\\" Life was not necessarily easy after this, but it was a good deal less traumatic. These overarching narratives were seen to be not only relevant to human life, but also to human history. Those who practiced this type of spiritual autobiography believed that \\"history repeats itself not only in man's outward, group existence, but in the spiritual life of individuals.\\"Starr, G.A. Defoe and Spiritual Autobiography. New York : Gordian Press (1979), 13. Evolution The spiritual autobiography's intense focus on the individual has led scholars to see it as a precursor to the novel, with later writers such as Daniel Defoe writing fictionalized accounts of a character's spiritual journey, such as Robinson Crusoe or Moll Flanders. Moreover, because, as G. A. Starr argues, English Protestantism had rejected the \\"otherworldliness\\" of Catholicism \\"and insisted on the compatibility of earthly and spiritual callings,\\" the \\"utterly mundane activities could be drawn upon to illustrate and enforce religious duties.\\" This also contributed to the growth of what we now know as the novel.Starr, 11. In the late 20th century, the spiritual autobiography has often reflected the struggle to reconcile variant forms of sexuality with Christian belief traditions, with the element of sincere struggle sometimes producing a polemical tone. Notable among these are titles by Jesuit John J. McNeill, \\"Bothe Feet Firmly Planted in Midair: My Spiritual Journey\\" (Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox Press); Episcopalian priest Malcolm Boyd, \\"Gay Priest, An Inner Journey (New York: St Martin's Press); Evangelical Minister Mel White's \\"Stranger at the Gate: To Be Gay and Christian in America\\" (New York: Plume/Penguin, 1995); Chris Glaser, self-described originally as a \\"fundamental Baptist and biblical literalist\\", published \\"Uncommon Calling: A Gay Man's Struggle to Serve the Church\\" (San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1988). There are many others that could be included to this sample. Beyond the Abrahamic traditions Recent examples in the genre often come from outside the Abrahamic traditions. See, for example, the expatriate British writer Christopher Isherwood's \\"My Guru and His Disciple\\" (London: Methuen, 1980); Jane Hamilton Merritt's \\"A Meditator's Diary: A Western woman's unique experiences in Thailand Monasteries\\" (London: Mandala/Unwin paperbacks, 1986); Irina Tweedie's \\"Daughter of Fire: A Diary of a Spiritual Training with a Sufi Master (Nevada City: Blue Dolphin Publishing, 1986. Originally published as \\"The Chasm of Fire\\", 1979); Andrew Harvey's \\"A Journey in Ladakh: Encounters with Buddhism\\" (1983) and \\"Hidden Journey: A Spiritual Awakening\\" (1991); Mark Matousek's \\"Sex Death Enlightenment: A True Story\\" (1996) and Victor Marsh's \\"The Boy in the Yellow Dress\\" (Melbourne: Clouds of Magellan Press, 2014). Worth considering too is Carol P. Christ's \\"Laughter of Aphrodite: Reflections on a Journey to the Goddess\\" (Harper San Francisco, 1988). Insightful work coming from the contemporary encounter of Western aspirants with Buddhism, includes Stephen Batchelor's \\"Confession of a Buddhist Atheist\\" (2011, New York, Spiegel and Grau). From the Japanese Zen tradition: Soko Morinaga Roshi's \\"Novice to Master: An Ongoing Lesson in the Extent of My Own Stupidity\\", trans. by Belenda Attaway Yamakawa (Boston: Wisdom Publications, 2002) Of special interest here is the remarkable study by Sarah H. Jacoby, \\"Love and Liberation: Autobiographical Writings of the Tibetan Buddhist Visionary Sera Khandro\\" (New York: Columbia University Press, 2014). Dr Jacoby's study draws on the rare autobiographical and biographical writing of Sera Kandro, \\"one of the few Tibetan women to record the story of her life.\\" Sera Khandro (1892 - 1940), who studied outside of the monastic disciplines, also wrote the biography of her guru, Drim√© √ñzer.

Main characters Pucca : Voiced by: : Tabitha St. Germain (English) (2006-2008) : Jeonghwa Yang (2018-) : Age: : 10-11 in Season 1 (11 since \\"Slam Bam Birthday Bash\\"), 11-12 in Season 2, 12-13 in Season 3 Pucca is the series' title character. She is a Korean girl who loves Garu. Pucca never talks, most likely in order to imitate Garu, who took a vow of silence. Pucca lives with her uncles, the three Master Chefs at the Gohrong Restaurant. She also delivers noodles from the restaurant on her scooter. Pucca is known all over Sooga Island as the \\"Kung Fu Chaser\\", and although she isn't a ninja, Pucca has demonstrated some unique abilities of her own that make up for what she lacks in training. Some of these abilities are a nearly indestructible head, the ability to run on water, Pucca can also transform into a Sailor Scout, a Little Mermaid, and a Power Ranger, Pucca also has her immense strength. And even though she is typically sweet-natured and cheerful lady, Pucca can be temperamental when she does not get what she wants. Pucca has very long black hair, but usually wears it in the odango style, accompanied by red scrunchies. She is often referred to being a goddess of weather as she caused rain clouds and wind to form: either when her uncle and the Master Chefs' feuding got annoying or when Ring Ring pushed her too far by taking Garu from her, causing her to fly away when the winds got too much. Garu : Voiced by: : Brian Drummond (English) (2006-2008) : Yongwoo Shin (2018-) : Age: : 12-13 in Season 1 (13 since \\"The Cursed Tie\\"), 13-14 in Season 2, 14-15 in Season 3 Garu is a dedicated ninja in training. As revealed in \\"Romancing the clone\\", he took a vow of silence, which is the reason why he never talks. He will immediately accept a quest if told it will bring him great honor. Like Pucca, Garu is capable of superhuman athletics and endurance. In addition to being a skilled ninja, Garu has also demonstrated the ability to play the erhu. Garu is very shy and does not display excessive affection towards Pucca in the TV series, but in the episode \\"And The Band Played Rong\\" Tobe insulted Pucca and Garu became infuriated and attacked him. Pucca and Garu's relationship is more exclusively shown in the original flash series, where they are more officially displayed as a couple. Garu is best friends with both Abyo and Ssoso. Garu has 2 rivals in the series, such as Tobe almost in every ep and Mooji in some eps. Garu loves animals like his cat Mio on Garu's hat. The Gohrong Restaurant Chefs : Voiced by: : Michael Dobson (Uncle Dumpling, 2006-2008) Kirk Thornton (Uncle Dumpling, 2018-) : Brian Dobson (Uncle Ho, 2006-2008) Spike Spencer (Uncle Ho, 2018-) : Dale Wilson (Uncle Linguini, 2006-2008) Steve Canden (Uncle Linguini, 2018-) Dumpling, Ho, and Linguini are three brothers and Pucca's uncles as well as her guardians. They are also the owners of The Gohrong Restaurant, where Linguine makes noodles, Dumpling cuts them and the other ingredients, and Hoe fries it all. They all are named after some food - Dumpling after the Dumpling, Ho after the Hoe, and Linguini after the Linguine. Their spectacular dish is the jajangmyeon noodles. They hold their noodles in very high regard, and possess a culinary honor system. In \\"Chef Slump,\\" it is revealed they are adapt into athletics and martial arts (but in a cooking matter).

A practitioner of kung-fu, Abyo is very outgoing, competitive, selfish, self-absorbed, confident, and excitable.

Abyo is the son of Bruce, the police chief of Sooga. He is patterned (or stereotyped) after Bruce Lee.

She is stylish, but vain and selfish, always wanting to be better and prettier than everyone else. However, no one pays attention to Ring Ring due to seeing her as she truly is. She resents Pucca for being more pretty and stylish than her. Ring Ring is the goddess of the wind, and is possibly from China (explaining her Chinese choice of clothing). When someone makes her angry or upset, she gains the ability to stretch and control her long hair and the sleeves of her dress, and the power to sing in a high octave. She also has a shih-tzu named Yuni. She spends most of her time trying to get attention off of Pucca or to hurt her. However, she occasionally sees the consequences in pushing Pucca too far. Ring Ring is very obsessed with Garu. Most of the time she's trying to best Pucca, so that Garu will love her, which most of the time utterly fails.

Tobe is obsessed with trying to strike vengeance on Garu. Tobe has an x-shaped scar between his eyes and usually wears his ninja mask, showing only the above. He is accompanied by his ninja minions who usually eliminate themselves by misinterpreting Tobe's commands or acting stupid. The Vagabond Ninja Clan : Voiced by: Bill Mondy (Clown), Shannon Chan-Kent (Chief), Louis Chirillo (Shaman) A trio of crooks mostly performing petty crimes. They are Binggure (a clown kicked out of the circus for not being able to laugh), Jumong (a bungling magician), and Jing-Jing/Chief (the female boss of the Vagabond Ninja Clan).

Doga : Voiced by: Kathleen Barr An evil witch with a foul temper, she attacks anyone if they so much as step on her shadow. Doga was known to harbor black magic powers, but were no match for Pucca's light and love energies. Supporting characters Santa Claus : Voiced by: French Tickner (2006-2008), Spike Spencer (2018-, credited on Finale Credits) First appeared in a Christmas story, but later began to appear frequently, showing what he does when it's not Christmas. This includes many jobs; such as being a doctor, a taxi driver and a shopkeeper. He is usually an unwitting victim of Pucca when she is after Garu. In one episode, Santa signs up to become a ninja like Garu. Before he became Santa, he was known as a thief called Red Lantern who used to work in pair with a ninja named Black Powder. Dada : Voiced by: Lee Tockar (2006-2008), Todd Haberkorn (2018-) : Age: 10-11 in Season 1, 11-12 in Season 2, 12-13 in Season 3 Dada is a dishwasher and waiter at the Goh-Rong restaurant. He is usually nervous, high-strung, and clumsy, frequently making accidents in the kitchen. He has a crush on Ring-Ring, until after the way she treated him in the end of \\"Soap Opera\\". In \\"Chef Napped,\\" he helped Ring-Ring kidnap noodle chefs from around the world, including the chefs: Dumpling, Ho and Linguini (as a form of revenge for the way they mistreated him). He and Ring-Ring were both foiled by Garu, Pucca and their friends. Dada once became Ring-Ring's boyfriend in \\"Soap Opera,\\" thanks to Mister Dishey (a bubble genie). When he was exposed by Pucca to everyone, Ring-Ring was furious and left him. Despite this, she is sympathetic towards him, as he often feels down and is grateful for her kindness. It's also hinted that Dada develops feelings for Pucca since then and doesn't think Garu is right for her. Hence, he teamed up with Ring-Ring again in \\"He Loves Me Not\\" to pretend to be Garu and divert his feelings for Ring-Ring. It was his attempt to show Pucca that she was wasting her time chasing after Garu and she should be with him instead. When Garu exposes Dada as the imposter, everyone was shocked. However, Pucca is angry with him for it because his actions was a form of betrayal to their friendship. Destiny Destiny is a golden Chinese-style dragon who lives in a cave behind the waterfall in Sooga Lake. Destiny is a lounge singer and piano player. He and Pucca attempted to plan a romantic date with her and Garu. Garu walked off, but when Destiny said that because he left Pucca crying, he has no honor he fights him. In the end, Pucca helped him to score his first gig in five hundred years performing at the Goh-Rong. He reappeared in \\"Chef Napped!\\" where he flew the gang to Las Vegas for the World of Noodles Convention, and helped to rescue the chefs when they were kidnapped. He also appeared in \\"Enter the Dragon Girls\\" as the Dragon Girls' troop leader. He was also seen in \\"Full Moon Pucca,\\" when Garu was lip-synching, Destiny was behind a fence, doing the real singing. And in \\"Garu Hood,\\" he ate the last noodle bowl so Garu Hood (aka Robin Hood) had to get it back. Destiny ended up eating Garu, Abyo, and Dada until Pucca beat him. Destiny can fly (though he has no wings), and breathe fire, but in addition, he can make himself grow larger by roaring or singing. Master Soo : Voiced by: Richard Newman A man who is always surrounded by beautiful handmaidens. He acts as a being of all knowledge, and is often seen riding on a cloud. Garu admires him. In \\"Woolen Warrior,\\" Master Soo is revealed to be one of the few legendary Fire Wasp Ninjas. Ssoso : Voiced by: Kathleen Barr (2006-2008), and Tony Azzolino (2018-) A young Buddhist monk who is very calm and collected, often speaking in proverbs and wise sayings, but also has terrible eyesight. He practiced martial arts many years in a Shaolin temple, but left there to seek better martial art skills. He is a rival to Abyo. Mio Garu's beloved black cat. It is said the time can be told by looking at Mio's eyes. He seems capable of performing a feline form of martial arts and is in love with Yani (Pucca's cat). He also hates to go to the vet's office to get a shot. Mio only went there because Yani was there as a moral support. Won Ching's pet chicken who is often seen on the top of her head. She is known to lay powerful eggs which lead Tobe to try and capture Won with failed results. Yani Pucca's pink cat, Yani is the most popular cat in Sooga village.

She is considered to be Yani's rival. Yuni can either be seen being an accomplice to Ring Ring in trying to one up Pucca or trying to stop her. The latter was evident in \\"Ring-Ring's Party Favors\\" when she was carrying an envelope (with an invitation to Ring-Ring for Pucca's party). Yuni was scolded by Ring-Ring in \\"Little Miss Sooga\\" for getting the silkworms and making Pucca's dress look better than hers. Minor characters Policeman Bruce : Voiced by: Dale Wilson (2006-2008), Kirk Thornton (2018-, credited on Finale Credits) Abyo's father, he usually chases after Abyo when he is being 'antisocial' (or destructive).

Career  Bleed Theory and Divest  Bleed Theory began as a studio project, more or less, by Dave Parker, Nate Kelley and Kurt Brown in the fall of 1997. Nate asked Morgan Evans to come down and collaborate on one of the tunes being worked on. Josh Eppard also joined around this time on drums. The band was a side project for Nate, Morgan and Josh, who were involved in Shabutie, Fuse, and 3 (band), respectively. Soon, Josh left to take Nate's place in Shabutie (later to become Coheed and Cambria) and Zac Shaw, a long time friend of Nate and Morgan took his place. The band proceeded until 2001 when Nate left and was replaced by Mike McCoy on bass. The band then evolved into Divest. After guitarist Dave Parker joined Coheed and Cambria as touring keyboardist Divest also went on hiatus until briefly reforming with three original members Morgan Evans (vocals), Kurt Brown (guitar) and Nate Kelley (bass).  Counterfeit Disaster  In the fall of 2004 Dave Parker, Joe Maggio, Sean-Paul Pillsworth, and Kenny Camacho came together and began writing for what would become Counterfeit Disaster. After a few months the project had to be put on hold indefinitely. In winter of 2005 the project was renewed, adding Dave Daw and Dave Bodie to help bring a more live sound to what was initially intended to be a fully sequenced project. Josh Eppard formally of Coheed and Cambria has now since joined on drums.  Coheed and Cambria  Dave Parker began playing live keyboards for Coheed and Cambria September 17, 2005 at Irving Plaza as part of the CMJ Festival. While with Coheed and Cambria, Dave Parker toured with: Avenged Sevenfold, Dredg, Circa Survive, Thrice, mewithoutYou in support of Coheed and Cambria's 2005 release Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume One: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness. Additionally, they shared the stage with Deftones, TOOL, Fall Out Boy, Muse, Thirty Seconds to Mars, and My Chemical Romance. During Parker's tenure Coheed and Cambria performed at Lollapalooza, Reading and Leeds Festivals, Coachella, Pukkelpop. He toured with the band until December 15, 2006, and appears on the DVD \\"The Last Supper: Live at Hammerstein Ballroom\\".  Weerd Science  Weerd Science is a project of Coheed and Cambria drummer Josh Eppard. Dave Parker toured with the project on keyboards. Weerd Science toured with Gym Class Heroes in 2004 and with Bane in 2005. Dave Parker also engineered the debut Weerd Science album Friends and Nervous Breakdowns which was released by Equal Vision Records in March 2005. Additionally, Dave Parker performed guitar, keyboards, some bass, some drum programming, and co-wrote Sick Kids which was released by Horris Records in May 2011.  Stellar Young  Dave Parker joined The City Never Sleeps in 2010. They released the Madison EP in 2011. The City Never Sleeps changed their name to Stellar Young in September 2012 and released the debut album Everything At Once in December 2013 for \\"name your price\\" on bandcamp.

It is also suspected to be involved in chronic periodontitis. Less frequently, A. actinomycetemcomitans is associated with nonoral infections such as endocarditis. Its role in aggressive periodontitis was first discovered by Danish-born periodontist J√∏rgen Slots, a professor of dentistry and microbiology at the University of Southern California School of Dentistry. 'Bacterium actinomycetem comitans' was first described by Klinger (1912) as coccobacillary bacteria isolated with Actinomyces from actinomycotic lesions in humans. It was reclassified as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans by Topley & Wilson (1929) and as Haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans by Potts et al. (1985). The species has attracted attention because of its association with localized aggressive periodontitis.  Nomenclature  Recent studies have shown a phylogenetic similarity of A. actinomycetemcomitans and Haemophilus aphrophilus, H. paraphrophilus, and H. segnis, suggesting the new genus Aggregatibacter for them.  Importance  It is one of the bacteria that might be implicated in destructive periodontal disease. Although it has been found more frequently in localized aggressive periodontitis, prevalence in any population is rather high. It has also been isolated from actinomycotic lesions (mixed infection with certain Actinomyces species, in particular A. israelii). It possesses certain virulence factors that enable it to invade tissues, such as the pore-forming toxin leukotoxin A. It has also been isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis and as an etiologic agent in endocarditis. The pore-forming toxin LtxA of A. actinomycetemcomitans may be a trigger of the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis due to its ability to stimulate protein citrullination, a post-translational protein modification targeted by autoantibodies in this disease.  Virulence factors  *Leukotoxin A: kills granulocytes, monocytes, and other white blood cells expressing integrin beta-2 (CD18) *Cytolethal distending toxin *Immunosuppression factors that inhibit blastogenesis, antibody production, and activate T-suppressor cells *Inhibition of granulocyte functions *Resistant to complement-mediated killing *Lipopolysaccharides *Surface antigens *Heat shock proteins *Antimicrobial resistance  A. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes  *a strain, for example ATCC 29523, frequently in oral cavity, variable leukotoxin expression *b strain Y4, most frequently in localized aggressive periodontitis, high leukotoxin expression; of the b subset, clone Jp2 is particularly leukotoxic *c strain ATCC 33384, low leukotoxin expression *serotypes d, e, f, g *within each serotype, leukotoxin expression can be highly variable between strains  Small RNA  In bacteria, small RNAs are involved in gene regulation. Jorth et al. identified 9 sRNA by Northern blotting from computer-predicted candidates in strain VT1169 and 202 sRNA by RNA seq in strain 624. A systematic screen by RNA-seq and RT-PCR in HK1651 strain (a clinical isolate from an aggressive periodontitis patient), quantified 70 sRNAs and further identified 17 differentially expressed sRNAs during growth phases. Target prediction indicated possibility of sRNA interaction with several virulence genes. This study confirmed the presence of one of previously identified Fur regulated sRNAs JA04 identified in strain HK1651.

According to the Chronicle of Fredegar, he was a son of one Chamar, a Frankish aristocrat, and rose to power under the Merovingian king Dagobert I, who appointed him as dux in the former Thuringian kingdom which Francia had conquered in 531. His installation was meant to protect the eastern border of the Frankish realm against the threatening Wends under Samo, who had defeated the king at the 631 Battle of Wogastisburg and formed an alliance with Dervan, prince of the Sorbian tribes settling in the adjacent region east of the Saale river. Radulf fought successfully against the Slavs, but subsequently refused the incorporation of the secured territories into the Austrasian kingdom. To retain his independence he allied with Fara, a descendant of the powerful Agilolfing dynasty in Bavaria who ruled over large estates along the Main river. About 640 King Sigebert III of Austrasia with his Mayors of the Palace, Adalgisel and Grimoald the Elder, marched against the insurgents and at first easily routed Fara's troops, while the Agilolfing himself was killed in battle. Reaching Thuringia however, Duke Radulf, entrenched in his fortress at the Unstrut river, was not overcome, partially because he had gained the support of significant numbers of the king's forces. In 642, he rebelled against Sigebert and defeated his army, taking the title of rex or king of Thuringia.Reuter, 55. His success is usually considered an indicator of the roi fain√©ant phenomenon and of undoing of the Merovingians' accomplishments. His sons, Theotbald and Heden I, succeeded him.

Beginnings  Trumbullplex was created in 1993, when members of the collective known formally as the Wayne Association of Collective Housing established a nonprofit corporation and purchased the property. This consisted of two Victorian houses on either side of a single-story art space, previously operated by Perry Mallette as the Trumbull Theater.http://www.bizapedia.com/mi/THE-TRUMBULL-THEATER.html The two houses are occupied by a fluctuating group of resident collective members, as well as like-minded short-term traveling artists, musicians, and activists. The resident collective members, along with other committed community members, work together to maintain the show space and provide accessible, meaningful community experiences to locals and travelers alike. The Trumbullplex has since grown to also include three adjacent, undeveloped side-lot properties, following a well-publicized bidding war with a local developer in 2016.http://www.freep.com/story/money/business/2016/06/09/detroit-sides- anarchists-over-developer-land-bid/85562778/ These side-lots function as community greenspace for potlucks, herb walks, and arts based events. They were bought from the city for $10,000.  Collective  Chicken coop of Trumbullplex in 2006 The collective's mission statement asserts that they ‚Äúwant to create a positive environment for revolutionary change in which economic and social relationships are based on mutual aid and the absence of hierarchy.‚Äù It acts on the basis of consensus decision-making and serves as a home, theater, art gallery, infoshop, meeting space and temporary residence for traveling activists. The art space is run on a donations-only basis, and members pay an equal portion of the costs involved in the property's upkeep each month. The Trumbullplex collective is engaged in homeless support, LGBTQ activism and Food Not Bombs. Members of the collective and surrounding community run the operations within the theater and meeting space and also participate in alternative schools, such as the high school for teenage mothers, the Catherine Ferguson Academy and CFA farm, the Hub of Detroit (a cycling non-profit located in the city's Cass Corridor), to Detroit organizations promoting urban agriculture such as Earthworks, and to a variety of other causes and organizations.  Zine library  In 2011, the Trumbullplex completed the addition of a free zine library located within the showspace, which houses over 2,000 independently published books, pamphlets, and fanzines. Many of these publications were donated to the Trumbullplex following the closing of the now defunct Idle Kids infoshop in Detroit's Cass Corridor. In addition to providing access to the zine library during events in the showspace as well as during regularly scheduled open hours, the Trumbullplex zine library has also provided pop-up versions of the collection at such local events as the Allied Media Conference and the Dally in the Alley festival.  25th birthday  In August 2018, the Trumbullplex celebrated being 25 years old with a two day party.

Separation mastering is essentially an inversion of the Technicolor three-strip system, which used filtration to create three black and white masters each sensitized for one of the RGB spectrums and then printed the negatives with a CMYK colorspace. In separation mastering, the original camera negative is used to create three black and white copies, each one filtered for one of the RGB spectrums.

Ownership Former logo of the radio station used until July 2010 In May 2005, Florida-based Hall Communications reached an agreement to acquire WILI and WILI-FM from Nutmeg Broadcasting Co. At the time of the purchase, Hall already owned WICH and WCTY in Norwich and WNLC and WKNL in New London. In addition, Hall owns a number of stations in medium-sized markets along the eastern seaboard from Vermont to Florida. Boom Box Parade WILI has gained international attention for its unusual July 4 Boom Box Parade. Called \\"Connecticut's Unique People's Parade,\\" it is the largest parade of its kind in the world. In 1986, no marching band could be found for Windham's Memorial Day Parade. Five weeks later, the \\"Boom Box Parade\\" concept was born, as WILI plays the marching band music on the air, while thousands march and watch, loudly playing their radios boom boxes. Anyone can march in the Boom Box Parade. The only requirement is to wear some red, white, and blue, and bring a radio tuned to WILI. American flags are optional, but encouraged. There is no official theme for the parade. Every year WILI morning disc jockey Wayne Norman serves as the parade's Grand Marshal. It was not held in 2020 due to the Coronavirus Pandemic but a Virtual Version was held instead.

The site is historically significant due to its role as a company town for the Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation shipyard during the first half of the twentieth century. In addition, Chickasaw was the subject of a United States Supreme Court case, Marsh v. Alabama (1946) upholding the First Amendment rights of individuals living in privately owned towns, because the towns were operated as public places. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 3, 2004. History Chickasaw Shipyard Village The company town of Chickasaw was built and owned in the early 20th century by Chickasaw Shipbuilding. In addition to well-built and attractive houses, the town included amenities such as a multipurpose community center, school, health clinic, and stores) and utility services (a water purification plant, and sewage treatment plant). One exceptionally well-built building originally served as an ice house. Later it was adapted for use as offices and a hospital. Some of the streets in the town were sidewalks, necessitating use of alleys for vehicular traffic. Tennis courts and a golf course were also available in the town. when Chickasaw Shipbuilding closed its shipyard, many houses were moved or demolished. Upon the purchase of the shipyard and town by Gulf Shipbuilding in 1940, the existing homes were repaired and modified. Additional city improvements (such as street paving) were made. The business block was a popular shopping area, consisting of numerous buildings connected by a covered concrete sidewalk which ran the length of the block (approximately 250 feet or 75 meters). The establishments included a drugstore, a grocery store, a restaurant, and post office. By 1943, Gulf Shipbuilding had leased the remaining space to other businesses. Many of the original homes still remain in Chickasaw and form the heart of a historic district. Primarily through the efforts of Gene Ford, an architectural historian from the University of Alabama, this area was documented and data was collected about its buildings and history. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. The Chickasaw Historic Preservation Society has created a driving tour featuring the highlights of the area. Incorporation of Chickasaw Early in 1946, Leedy Investment Company purchased the entire company town for one million dollars. Current occupants were given the option to purchase the homes they had been renting. Many prior residents also purchased homes and moved back to the town. The city of Chickasaw was incorporated on November 12, 1946. In 1979, Halter Marine reactivated the shipbuilding facility to provide service vessels and tugboats to the booming offshore oil industry. The resurgence was short-lived and the facility was closed again in 1983. The former shipyard now serves as a small general cargo facility.

Its product designation is TSR 9115. The book was designed by Tracy and Laura Hickman, and features artwork by Jeff Easley and Timothy Truman. Plot summary In RPGA1 Rahasia, the heroes seek to save a kidnapped elven maid, and to do so they must enter the Temple of the Sacred Black Rock, break a curse, and capture the evil Rahib. In the revised module B7 Rahasia, the adventurers must save a group of kidnapped elven women held in the dungeons beneath a good elven temple taken over by an evil cleric. An elven village is threatened by a dark Priest known only as the Rahib. He has kidnapped two of the village's fairest maidens and now demands that Rahasia, the most beautiful elf, surrender herself to free the others. The player characters are drawn into this adventure when they find a plea for help from Rahasia. The only way to free the captured maidens is to enter an old temple, built upon the ruins of a wizard's tower buried under a mountain. Publication history The original Rahasia was written by Laura Hickman, and was first published in 1979 by DayStar West Media as a thirty two page booklet. Daystar West Media was Tracy Hickman's private publishing company, and no more than 200 copies were ever printed. Rahasia was the first in the Night Ventures line of scenarios. The Hickmans decided to privately publish the first two adventures they had designed together, Rahasia and Pharaoh, which gained them a reputation on a local level. However, disaster struck when Tracy went into business with an associate who went bad, leaving the Hickmans to cover $30,000 in bad checks. They were driven into bankruptcy, and Tracy decided to sell their modules to TSR, \\"literally so that I could buy shoes for my children\\". TSR decided not only to buy the modules, but hire Tracy as a game designer. He said of the event: \\"They said it would be easier to publish my adventures if I was part of the company. So, we made the move from Utah to Wisconsin.\\" Tracy and Laura Hickman rewrote Rahasia, which was published by TSR in 1983 as a sixteen-page booklet with an outer folder, with the code RPGA1, and sold as a limited edition only to members of the RPGA. In 1984, TSR revised and compiled RPGA1 Rahasia and the second tournament module RPGA2 Black Opal Eye, and published the combined adventure as B7 Rahasia, a thirty two page booklet with an outer folder, featuring cover art by Jeff Easley and interior art by Easley and Tim Truman. Rahasia (1979 Daystar West Media Edition) This module was later featured in the compilation B1-B9 In Search of Adventure in 1987. Credits Design: Tracy and Laura Hickman Editing: Curtis Smith Cover Art: Jeff Easley Interior Art: Jeff Easley and Timothy Truman Cartography: David S. \\"Diesel\\" LaForce and David C. Sutherland III Art Direction: Ruth Hoyer Reception Wayne Ligon reviewed the adventure in The Space Gamer No. 73. Ligon commented, \\"A nice story combined with an interesting temple complex makes this module a good one. The villains are well-portrayed and have definite objectives.\\" He felt that this was a good module all in all, because the emphasis is not on killing, and the module forces the players to think. In his review of B1-9 In Search of Adventure in Dragon magazine #128 (December 1987), Ken Rolston calls Rahasia one of the \\"two exceptionally fine adventures\\" in the compilation, and \\"a classic low- level FRPG scenario\\".

It is located north of Edgewood. It is operated by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources as one of the Iowa state preserves. Bixby State Preserve is one of the few places in the world to contain algific talus slopes and consequently has an ecosystem encountered in only a few other sites, all in the Driftless Area. They are mainly elsewhere in Iowa, but also in southeastern Minnesota, southwestern Wisconsin and northwestern Illinois. In winter and early spring comparatively warm air rises from the elaborate system of sinkholes, causing cold moist air to be drawn into the north-facing talus slopes and sent through fissures into ice caves, where it turns to ice on the walls of the cave. In summer and fall, the system is reversed, with cool moist air venting to the talus slopes, creating a unique ecosystem. The only road into the preserve is closed on both the north and south sides of the preserve as of June 7, 2013. The south entrance is open during the summer. Trout fishing is allowed.

Turan Topal converted to Christianity in 1989 whereas Hakan Ta≈ütan converted in 1994. The men were accused of insulting Turkish heritage and inciting hate against Muslims while allegedly trying to convert other Turks to Christianity. The men were charged under Turkey's Article 301, which has been used to bring charges against dozens of Turkish intellectuals. According to the written charges, the three plaintiffs, identified as Fatih Kose, 23, Alper, 16, and Oguz, 17, claimed the two Christians had called Islam a \\"primitive and fabricated religion\\" and had described Turks as a \\"cursed people.\\" They also accused the defendants of opposing the Turkish military, encouraging sexual misconduct, procuring funds from abroad to entice young people in Silivri to become Christians and secretly compiling data on private citizens for a local Bible correspondence course. The newspaper Zaman even claimed that the two Christians were connected to Hakan Ekinci, the man who on October 3 hijacked a Turkish Airlines plane to Italy where he claimed to be Christian and a conscientious objector, and had appealed to Pope Benedict XVI for asylum. The spokesman for the Alliance of Protestant Churches in Turkey, Isa Karatas, says that there is no evidence against the men. He claims that charges filed against them are based only on verbal allegations without any proof. The men have had several hearings since November, 2006, the most recent being April 18, 2007. Another hearing is scheduled for July 18, 2007 reportedly because one of the accusers did not show up. The next hearing was held in Silivri, Turkey, on September 2007, where the judge excused himself from the trial. He then referred the case to a judge in a higher court district in Istanbul. In July 2007 the men were summoned by the police and ordered to pay a fine for collecting money without a permission. This first hearing is now scheduled for December 29, 2007.

Unionization In 1944, Local 1250 of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, CIO won a new contract with Oppenheim Collins that included a closed shop, a $2.00 pay increase, and elimination of \\"free\\" overtime work during peak sales and inventory periods.Department Store Employee, January 28, 1944, Local 1250 Wins New Contract At OC.

Stewart developed a unique system of materialistic pantheism.Fairer, David. (2009). Organising Poetry: The Coleridge Circle, 1790-1798. Oxford University Press. p. 53.  Travels  Known as 'Walking' Stewart to his contemporaries for having travelled on foot from Madras, India (where he had worked as a clerk for the East India Company) back to Europe between 1765 and the mid-1790s. Stewart is thought to have walked alone across Persia, Abyssinia, Arabia, and Africa before wandering into every European country as far east as Russia. Over the next three decades Stewart wrote prolifically, publishing nearly thirty philosophical works, including The Opus Maximum (London, 1803) and the long verse-poem The Revelation of Nature (New York, 1795). In 1796, George Washington's portrait-painter, James Sharples, executed a pastel likeness of Stewart for a series of portraits which included such sitters as William Godwin, Joseph Priestley, and Humphry Davy, suggesting the intellectual esteem in which Stewart was once held. After his travels in East India, Stewart became a vegetarian.Preece, Rod. (2008). Sins of the Flesh: A History of Ethical Vegetarian Thought. UBC Press. p. 243. He was also a teetotaler.Taylor, Harvey. (1997). A Claim on the Countryside: A History of the British Outdoor Movement. Keele University Press. p. 56. Materialistic pantheism During his journeys, he developed a unique system of materialist philosophy which combines elements of Spinozistic pantheism with yogic notions of a single indissoluble consciousness. Stewart began to promote his ideas publicly in 1790 with the publication in two volumes of his works Travels over the most interesting parts of the Globe and The Apocalypse of Nature (London, 1790). Historian David Fairer has written that \\"Stewart expounds what might be described as a panbiomorphic universe (it deserves an entirely new term just for itself), in which human identity is no different in category from a wave, flame, or wind, having an entirely modal existence.\\"  Retirement  After retiring from travelling, Stewart eventually settled in London where he held philosophical soir√©es and earned a reputation as one of the city's celebrated eccentrics.Timbs, John. (1875). English Eccentrics and Eccentricities. London: Chatto and Windus. pp. 300-304 He was often seen in public wearing a threadbare Armenian military uniform. John Timbs described Stewart as one London's famous eccentrics.  Death  On 20 February 1822, the morning after his seventy-fifth birthday, 'Walking' Stewart's body was found in a rented room in Northumberland Place, near present-day Trafalgar Square, London. An empty bottle of laudanum lay beside him. Literary influence After Walking Stewart's travels came to an end around the turn of the nineteenth century, he became close friends with the English essayist and fellow-Londoner Thomas De Quincey, with the radical pamphleteer Thomas Paine, and with the Platonist Thomas Taylor (1758-1835). In 1792, while residing in Paris in the weeks following the September Massacres, he made the acquaintance of the young Romantic poet William Wordsworth, who later concurred with De Quincey in describing Stewart as the most eloquent man on the subject of Nature that either had ever met. Recent scholarship by Kelly Grovier has suggested that Stewart's persona and philosophical writings had a major influence on Wordsworth's poetry.

Her work was integral to British Magazine The New Age which she helped edit along with her lover, A. R. Orage, prior to the outbreak of the First World War. Hastings was also friend and lover of Katherine Mansfield, whose work was first published in The New Age.Edensor, Louise. (2016). Une profession de foi pour tourjours: Katherine Mansfield and Beatrice Hastings in France. In Claire Davison, Gerri Kimber. Katherine Mansfield‚Äôs French Lives. Brill. pp. 23-39. She also had love affairs with Wyndham Lewis and Amedeo Modigliani.Meyers, Jeffrey. (1985). The Craft of Literary Biography. p. 118 Biography Beatrice Hastings was born in London but grew up in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. She was educated in Pevensey, Kent, near Hastings, which may have supplied her chosen name.Robert Scholes, Modernist Journals Project https://modjourn.org/biography/hastings- beatrice-emily-alice-haigh-1879-1943/ From 1896 to 1899, she attended the University of Oxford to study Literature. In 1907 she met A. R. Orage, the editor of The New Age magazine, with whom she embarked on a romantic relationship. Hastings soon began contributing to the magazine and went on to become one of its most prolific contributors, although most of her work appeared under pseudonyms. These include: Pagan, Alice Morning, A.M.A., E.H., B.L.H., Beatrice Tina, Cynicus, Robert a Field, T.K.L., D. Triformis, Edward Stafford, S. Robert West, V.M., G. Whiz, J. Wilson, Annette Doorly, Hastings Lloyd, Mrs. Malaprop, and T.W.Robert Scholes, Modernist Journals Project https://modjourn.org/biography/hastings-beatrice-emily-alice-haigh-1879-1943/ Hastings' work for The New Age spanned many different forms and genres, including items of correspondence, parody, poetry, polemic, travel writing, prose fiction, and dramatic dialogue. She described herself in one instance as 'a minor poet of the first class.'.Beatrice Hastings, ‚ÄòTwo Reviews‚Äô, The New Age, 13.26 (October 23rd, 1913) , p.759. One of Hastings' greatest talents was parody, and she composed parodies of many her contemporaries, including Ezra Pound, Filippo Marinetti, and H.G. Wells.See: \\"T.K.L.\\", 'The Way Back to America' (NA 13.21); \\"T.K.L.\\", 'Wake Up, England!\\" (NA 15.8), \\"B.H. and K.M.\\", 'A P.S.A.' (NA 9.4) Hastings was also outspoken in her feminist views and The New Age correspondence section provided the space in which she developed many of the ideas which would inform her 1909 feminist tract, Woman's Worst Enemy: Woman. In 1914 Hastings moved to Paris and became a figure in bohemian circles due to her friendship with Max Jacob. She shared an apartment in Montparnasse with Amedeo Modigliani and became a model for countless paintings, including his 1916 Seated Nude. Another friend was adventure novelist Charles Beadle, with whom she had several things in common. He grew up in Hackney, spent time in South Africa (participating in the Boer War as a member of the British South African Police), and published several novels about bohemian life in Paris. When Beadle came to America, from Paris, in November 1916, he listed Hastings as his nearest friend in Paris. Towards the end of her life Hastings felt excluded from the literary recognition she felt her due, and blamed Orage, whom she accused of conspiring to keep her out of literary circles in Britain. She published a pamphlet, The Old New Age (1936), in which she bitterly criticised Orage, calling him 'a rustic, a lout, a snob‚Äô.Beatrice Hastings, The Old New Age: Orage and Others (London: Blue Moon Press, 1936), p.18 Hastings claimed that she ‚Äòoffended Orage‚Äôs masculine amour-propre, and for this, was made the victim of a social cabale [‚Ä¶] a literary boycott that does, or should, matter to every reading person‚Äô.Hastings, The Old New Age, p.3 While many of the contents of this pamphlet are thought to be exaggerated, it nevertheless shines a light on Orage's already well-documented misogyny, and the experience of being a female author in the 1910s. In 1943, probably suffering from cancer, she killed herself with gas from a domestic cooker.  Posthumous Recognition  Although in her lifetime Hastings was regarded as a relatively minor literary figure, more recently she has been praised for her innovative use of pseudonyms and her pioneering feminist views. Wallace Martin mentions her in his seminal study of The New Age, commenting that ‚ÄòBeatrice Hastings displayed amazing versatility as reviewer, poet, and satirist; she was most effective, albeit unnecessarily malicious, in the last capacity.‚ÄôWallace Martin, The New Age Under Orage: Chapters in English Cultural History (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1967), p.125. Literary critic Robert Scholes has noted that \\"Hastings, who was an important presence on the New Age editorial staff before the war, had an unhappy life that ended in suicide, never receiving the recognition as a writer that she sought.\\"Scholes, Robert. (2008). Paradoxy of Modernism. Yale University Press. p. 222. Theosophy Hastings was a convert to Theosophy. She attempted to defend Helena Blavatsky from charges of fraud and plagiarism. In 1937, she published two volumes entitled, Defence of Madame Blavatsky. Her writings on Theosophy have been criticized by skeptics. Biographer Peter Washington suggested that Hastings \\"suffered from delusions of literary grandeur.\\"Washington, Peter. (1995).

He was the eighth child of Jean-Fran√ßois- Paul-Emile, Count of Oultremont and of the Holy Roman Empire, and Marie- Isabelle of Bavaria, Countess of Warfus√©e and Druynen and Baroness of Schagen. He was born, lived and died in the castle of Warfus√©e (now within the municipality of Saint-Georges-sur-Meuse). Charles of Oultremont studied at the College of Reims and at Louis-le-Grand in Paris. He was nominated Canon of the Cathedral of Li√®ge by the Pope in 1733. He was ordained Deacon on 22 April 1764, and priest two days later. Upon the death of Prince-Bishop Jean-Th√©odore of Bavaria in January 1763, Prince Clemens of Saxony, only son of the King of Poland, Frederick Augustus III, applied to become the next prince-bishop. His young age (only 24), however, disqualified him. In addition, he was not yet a priest and did not belong to the chapter of the cathedral. He wrote to Pope Clement XIII, who grant him eligibility. Clemens received the support from France and Austria, but not from canon priests of Li√®ge, who preferred a local, namely Count Charles of Oultremont. The latter was elected on 20 April 1763, with 30 votes to 19. Prince Clemens protested and appealed to the Pope and the Emperor. Emperor Francis I intervened in favour of his prot√©g√©, but the Pope confirmed the election, and Charles took his office as prince-bishop on 8 April 1764. He was consecrated at the Cathedral of Saint Lambert of Li√®ge on 30 May. The new prince vowed to protect the authority and independence of the territory against the government of the Netherlands, the Abbot of Sint- Truiden and the Abbess-Princess of Munsterbilzen. The reign of Charles of Oultremont was marked more by his ecclesiastical achievements than his political ones. He fought against Jansenism, against Febronianism, and against immoral writings which came flooding from France. He created new charitable institutions and enhanced the level of theological studies. Politically, he was frequently in dispute with the Austrian Netherlands, who had supported Prince Clemens. He executed numerous works to improve trade, industry and agriculture, and ordered the paving of roads towards France, other German states and the United Provinces. Charles of Oultremont also encountered problems with the Teutonic Order, who claimed to be exempt of taxation in virtue of their privileges. Influenced by his brother, he also raised the quarters of nobility from eight to sixteen to be admitted into the council of the nobility. This effectively reduced the total number of noble families to around 15.

It is classed, pharmacologically, as a typical antipsychotic. Chemically it is a thioxanthene. It is the cis-isomer of clopenthixol (Sordinol, Ciatyl). Clopenthixol was introduced in 1961, while zuclopenthixol was introduced in 1978. Zuclopenthixol is a D1 and D2 antagonist, Œ±1-adrenergic and 5-HT2 antagonist. While it is approved for use in Australia, Canada, Ireland, India, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa and the UK it is not approved for use in the United States. Medical uses Available forms Zuclopenthixol is available in three major preparations: * As zuclopenthixol decanoate (Clopixol Depot, Cisordinol Depot), it is a long- acting intramuscular injection. Its main use is as a long-acting injection given every two or three weeks to people with schizophrenia who have a poor compliance with medication and suffer frequent relapses of illness. There is some evidence it may be more helpful in managing aggressive behaviour. * As zuclopenthixol acetate (Clopixol-Acuphase, Cisordinol-Acutard), it is a shorter-acting intramuscular injection used in the acute sedation of psychotic inpatients. The effect peaks at 48‚Äì72 hours providing 2‚Äì3 days of sedation. * As zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride (Clopixol, Cisordinol), it is a tablet used in the treatment of schizophrenia in those who are compliant with oral medication. It is also used in the treatment of acute bipolar mania. Dosing As a long-acting injection, zuclopenthixol decanoate comes in a 200 mg and 500 mg ampoule. Doses can vary from 50 mg weekly to the maximum licensed dose of 600 mg weekly. In general, the lowest effective dose to prevent relapse is preferred. The interval may be shorter as a patient starts on the medication before extending to 3 weekly intervals subsequently. The dose should be reviewed and reduced if side effects occur, though in the short-term an anticholinergic medication benztropine may be helpful for tremor and stiffness, while diazepam may be helpful for akathisia. 100 mg of zuclopenthixol decanoate is roughly equivalent to 20 mg of flupentixol decanoate or 12.5 mg of fluphenazine decanoate. In acutely psychotic and agitated inpatients, 50 ‚Äì 200 mg of zuclopenthixol acetate may be given for a calming effect over the subsequent three days, with a maximum dose of 400 mg in total to be given. As it is a long-acting medication, care must be taken not to give an excessive dose. In oral form zuclopenthixol is available in 10, 25 and 40 mg tablets, with a dose range of 20-60 mg daily. Side effects Chronic administration of zuclopenthixol (30 mg/kg/day for two years) in rats resulted in small, but significant, increases in the incidence of thyroid parafollicular carcinomas and, in females, of mammary adenocarcinomas and of pancreatic islet cell adenomas and carcinomas. An increase in the incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas is a common finding for D2 antagonists which increase prolactin secretion when administered to rats. An increase in the incidence of pancreatic islet cell tumours has been observed for some other D2 antagonists. The physiological differences between rats and humans with regard to prolactin make the clinical significance of these findings unclear. Withdrawal syndrome: Abrupt cessation of therapy may cause acute withdrawal symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, or insomnia). Symptoms usually begin in 1 to 4 days of withdrawal and subside within 1 to 2 weeks. Other permanent side effects are similar to many other typical antipsychotics, namely extrapyramidal symptoms as a result of dopamine blockade in subcortical areas of the brain. This may result in symptoms similar to those seen in Parkinson's disease and include a restlessness and inability to sit still known as akathisia, a slow tremor and stiffness of the limbs. Zuclopenthixol is thought to be more sedating than the related flupentixol, though possibly less likely to induce extrapyramidal symptoms than other typical depots. As with other dopamine antagonists, zuclopenthixol may sometimes elevate prolactin levels; this may occasionally result in amenorrhoea or galactorrhoea in severe cases. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a rare but potentially fatal side effect. Any unexpected deterioration in mental state with confusion and muscle stiffness should be seen by a physician.

The Navy Customs mission is detailed by Navy Reserves and augmented by the active-duty Navy; they are mobilized for a period of 320 days. Upon receipt of orders for mobilization, the reserve members report to a Navy Mobilization Processing Site for processing and screening to ensure they are fit for duty and have no issues that will preclude them from carrying out their primary mission. This process usually takes approximately two weeks from when they report in until they are sent to NAVELSG for training. Upon arrival at NAVELSG, the sailors undergo a month of training in everything they need to know to operate in the USCENTCOM theater of operations in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom. They are trained in the use of weapons, driving tactical vehicles, first aid, small unit tactics, hand-to-hand combat and the procedures and standards required of items and personnel re-entering the United States from overseas. Upon completion of training, they are certified as Customs Border Clearance Agents, with the authority to carry out customs inspection on equipment and personnel within USCENTCOM only. Upon arrival in the theater of operations, all personnel check in with the US Army Personnel Support Battalion located at the Army Life Support Area (ALSA), Ali Al Salem, Kuwait.

He also served as one of the first members of the Kansas Legislature. Early life Crawford was born in Lawrence County, Indiana and grew up on a farm while he attended school in Bedford, Indiana. He later attended law school at Cincinnati College. His parents were William and Jane (Morrow) Crawford, who were natives of North Carolina and had moved to Indiana Territory in 1815. His paternal grandparents were James and Mary (Fraser) Crawford, his grandfather having been a Revolutionary soldier. Arrival in Kansas Samuel J. Crawford arrived in Kansas Territory and began the practice of law at Garnett, Kansas on March 1, 1859. In May of the same year of his arrival he attended the Osawatomie Convention and participated in the organization of the Republican Party in Kansas. In September of the same year he was a delegate to the Republican state convention at Topeka, which placed in nomination state officers under the Wyandotte Constitution. In November 1859, he was elected a member of the first state Legislature, and assisted in putting the state government into operation. Military career Toward the close of the first session the country was involved in war. He resigned his legislative seat to become captain in the 2nd Kansas Infantry. He participated in the 1861 Southwest Missouri campaign led by General Lyon, and took part in all the engagements, including the crucial Battle of Wilson's Creek. In March 1862, Crawford was assigned command of Company A, 2nd Kansas Cavalry, and later commanded of a battalion in the same regiment. With the 2nd Kansas Cavalry he was with General James G. Blunt in Southwest Missouri, Arkansas, and Indian Territory until early in the fall of 1862. During that time he participated in the battles of Newtonia, Old Fort Wayne, Cane Hill, Bald Peak, Cove Creek, Prairie Grove and Van Buren. At Old Fort Wayne he led his battalion in the charge which resulted in the capture of an entire battery of artillery. On March 12, 1863, he was assigned command of the 2nd Kansas Cavalry and soon afterward joined Blunt at Fort Gibson for an expedition south through the Choctaw Nation. This campaign ended with the taking of Fort Smith, Arkansas and Colonel Crawford was instrumental in capturing a number of prisoners, wagons, horses, a Confederate paymaster and $40,000 of Confederate money. In November 1863, he was appointed colonel of the 2nd Kansas (Colored) Infantry (later the 83rd U.S. Colored Troops). His regiment participated in the Camden Expedition and performed admirably in the Battle of Jenkins' Ferry where it relieved an Indiana regiment and captured a rebel artillery battery consisting of three guns. In March 1864, he joined General Frederick Steele on an expedition to the Red River under the general command of General Nathaniel Banks. At Jenkins Ferry his command lost heavily and his own horse was shot. Governor While still in active service, on September 8, 1864, Crawford was nominated for governor of Kansas. On October 1 he was granted a leave of absence, the first he had had since entering the service at the beginning of the war. However, on arriving in Kansas learned of Price's Missouri Raid. Instead of entering the canvass for office, he at once reported to and was assigned to the staff of General Samuel R. Curtis. For meritorious services on the field of battle he was brevetted Brigadier General on March 13, 1865. On November 8, 1864, he was elected governor, and on January 9, 1865 took the oath of office; On September 5, 1866 he became the first person to be re- elected governor of Kansas. Governor Crawford resigned on November 4, 1868 to take command of the 19th Kansas Volunteer Cavalry which was to join the 7th United States Cavalry in the Custer-Sheridan Winter Campaign of 1868‚Äì69. Retirement After retiring from the governorship Crawford was in the real estate business at Emporia, Kansas until 1876, when he moved to Topeka to undertake the prosecution of certain claims against the United States for indemnity school lands, and in this he rendered much aid to Kansas. Subsequently, he moved to Washington, DC, and practiced law there for a number of years. Among other activities Crawford published Kansas in the '60s, a work which attracted much attention as a picture of conditions in early Kansas history. On December 1, 1870 he formed the Florence Town Company. It was a group of men who learned of the proposed route of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway who decided on a town site where the railroad would cross the Cottonwood River. He named the town, Florence, in honor of his daughter.Century of Pride, 1872‚Äì1972 : Florence Kansas Centennial; Florence Centennial Book Committee; 1972. Legacy Samuel J.

It was discontinued in 1978.Teagle, J. and Sprung, J.: Fender Amps: The First Fifty Years. This reissue differs significantly from the original 6G15 circuit. The unit has 4 tubes: V1 (Input/preamplifier, a 12AX7 as opposed to a 12AT7 in the earlier three-tube version), V2 (reverb driver, a 6V6 as opposed to a 6K6 in the original), V3 (reverb recovery, a 12AX7), and V4 (a buffer stage, using another 12AX7). V4 acts to reduce changes in output impedance when the wet-dry mix is varied, ameliorating the ‚Äútone suck‚Äù (loss of volume and some high frequency signal) seen with the original and later reissue 3 tube versions. Further, the 6V6 driver was wired with fixed bias (as opposed to cathode biased in the 6G15 circuit) and in triode mode (with plate and grid connected). Reissue (1994-2016) A reissue of the original tube reverb was introduced in 1994 and manufactured through 2016. Some changes in the circuit were made to accommodate a 6V6 reverb driver tube, replacing the obsolete 6K6. Reissues also have two printed circuit boards (potentiometers are mounted on the smaller of the two) and a mix of hand wiring and spade connectors. It is available with white, black or brown tolex. Fender also now makes a tweed- covered Reverb Unit to match its Tweed amplifiers of the 1950s.

It was directed by Leonard B. Stern and was released in July 1979 by Columbia Pictures. Plot Bill (George Burns) is an elderly ex- vaudevillian who lives alone, often looking at photographs of his deceased wife. Each day after breakfast, he goes to the supermarket, where he interacts in a friendly way with employees, often charming them with a magic trick. Kate (Brooke Shields) is a teen-age girl who gets in a squabble with an intimidating man named Demesta (William Russ). The girl, who is wrapped in a towel and apparently otherwise nude, has locked herself in a bathroom to evade Demesta. He pounds on the door and demands to know the details of a drug deal that Kate has fouled up. Kate escapes through the window, wearing only the towel, while a police officer knocks on the door of the apartment and grapples with Demesta. Demesta is chased down the street while Kate goes in a different direction. She slips down a hillside staircase, losing the towel in the process. Bill comes out of the grocery store, talking to the bag boy about magic tricks, and opens the trunk of his Pierce Arrow. They both see Kate, lying naked in the trunk. Stunned, Bill convinces the bag boy that it was just an illusion and drives away. Stopping on a secluded street, he confronts Kate, who asks him to take her to his house. He reluctantly agrees. Bill asks Kate what's going on but she refuses to answer. He allows her to take shelter in his home and loans her some of his clothes. Kate attempts to escape by dropping out of a window, spraining her ankle in the process. This attracts the attention of Bill's nosy neighbors, Stan (John Schuck) and Sue (Andrea Howard). Next, Bill goes to see his friend Max (Burl Ives), in a nursing home. Max, another ex-vaudevillian and a former roommate, is despondent and non- verbal. Bill visits him daily, cheerfully describing his daily activities. Today, he tells Max about Kate. Later, Bill is confronted by his daughter, Shirl (Lorraine Gary) and her husband, Harris (Nicolas Coster). Shirl feels that Bill is senile and tries to get power of attorney of his bank account. Bill refuses and Shirl becomes furious. Meanwhile, Demesta is still in a rage. He intimidates Kate's friend, Roy (Christopher Knight), and vows to find Kate, implying that he will harm her. Stan and Sue step up their meddling, calling Shirl about Kate. Shirl returns, demands to see Kate, and is put off by Bill again, who denies harboring a juvenile. Kate finally confesses to Bill that she is on the run from a drug dealer. She claims that Demesta gave her money to make a connection but that she threw the cache into the sewer in a moment of panic. Bill advises her to go to the police but Kate is afraid to do so. That night, Bill's poker buddies arrive and he introduces them to Kate. The evening is interrupted when Shirl returns with two police officers. Kate is concealed with a levitation magic trick and Shirl becomes more furious. The next day, before Bill leaves to visit Max, Kate relates the story of a boy she once knew who also refused to talk and how the boy started talking once all the other kids ignored him. During the visit, Bill tells Max that he will never come to see him again unless Max talks. Max breaks down and begs Bill not to leave. Bill returns home to find Kate gone and becomes despondent. Meanwhile, Kate returns to her foster home, collects her belongings, and meets Roy at school. Kate reveals that she never made the connection and still has the $20,000 in cash. Shocked, Roy tells her that Demesta will kill her. She says she plans to leave town with the money. When Roy tells her that Demesta knows where she has been hiding, she becomes concerned about Bill. After she returns to Bill's house, Demesta forces his way in and a chase ensues. Bill holds Demesta at bay with a sword and incapacitates him. The police are summoned and Demesta is arrested. Shirl arrives and Bill asks her for a favor. Max packs his belongings, preparing to go back home with Bill, when he learns that Shirl and Harris have agreed to act as foster parents for Kate. Bill explains that Kate will stay with him and Max on the week-ends. The film ends with the threesome departing together.

Atlam√°l, on the other hand, is believed to be of an age consistent with composition in Greenland. Moreover, some aspects of the poem itself are suggestive of Greenland. In particular one of Kostbera's ominous dreams has a realistic description of a polar bear. The grim tone of the poem is also consistent with what is known of the Greenland settlement. The relatively mean conditions of the chieftains in the poem--the Niflungar, for example, have only 10 retainers--have also been taken as strengthening the case for an origin in Greenlandic culture.Dronke 1969:107-10.

The role was portrayed by Finola Hughes from 1999 to 2001. The character is the twin sister of fan favorite General Hospital character Anna Devane, who Hughes also brought to All My Children from 2001 to 2003. In 2017, Hughes reprised the role on General Hospital, when Alex began posing as Anna, and continues to appear in the role. Casting Finola Hughes was cast as Alexandra Devane in 1999. At first, it was unknown what character she would portray. Alexandra debuted on July 23, 1999. Hughes left in the fall of 2000 for maternity leave and returned in February 2001. Alex left on July 9, 2001, to Budapest, Hungary. Hughes reprised her role as Alexandra on General Hospital, beginning April 5, 2017, masquerading as Anna; the duplicity wasn't revealed until May 12, 2017. Hughes ended her reprisal role of Alexandra on June 8, 2017. Hughes reprised the role from March 18 to 21, 2019.  Character history  Alexandra and new husband, Dimitri Marick, were headed back to town from London to break the news of their marriage. Before they could tell the good news, Dimitri fell ill and subsequently died. She elected to remain hidden at the airport while Dimitri and his loved ones traveled to Seaview Hospital to see if there was anything that the doctors could do to resurrect Dimitri. Alex finally made her presence known when Edmund Grey asked that an autopsy be done on his brother to determine the cause of his death. Alex stepped forward and announced that an autopsy would not be performed. Edmund said that he was Dimitri's brother and would decide what was to be done. It was then that Alex dropped the bombshell that she was the new Mrs. Marick. Erica Kane did not take well to the news that Dimitri had found another lover. Many doubted Alex's sincerity and feelings for Dimitri, but Peggy and Brooke English both could see the affection in her eyes. When alone, Alex would reflect on happier times with Dimitri. They had made plans to start a family together and re-settle in Pine Valley. There was also talk of Alexandra agreeing to do something quite odd for Dimitri, but what this was not revealed. Alex continued to act strangely to her husband's death, refusing to share the medical report findings and then ordering a closed casket funeral. Edmund managed to get the casket open, and found nothing inside. Alex admitted that Dimitri was still alive, dying from a debilitating illness. He'd begged her to not let his friends and family see him so weak and to stage his death instead. Edmund refused to accept his brother writing off survival so quickly and persuaded Alex and Dimitri to try stem cell therapy to save his life. Amazingly, the treatments began to work, but one day Dimitri wandered near the ocean. His dressing down was found at the shore, and his loved ones could only assume he was dead. Alex and Edmund got off to a rocky start, but slowly they fell in love and planned to be married. Alex was having strange flashes of memory and began to wonder if she was going insane, or if she was Anna Devane, a look-alike who had been presumed dead almost 10 years earlier in a boat explosion. In actuality, Alex's \\"loving\\" mother Charlotte had once placed her in a brainwashing facility (disguised as a mental hospital) and forced her into becoming a secret agent in a terrorist organization. Alex was supposed to kill Anna. When she couldn't go through with it, Charlotte had her crew kill Anna and implanted false memories in Alex's mind to make her believe she was Anna. Charlotte was planning on killing her but Edmund stopped her in the nick of time. While being taken away by the police, Charlotte had a final revelation: She was not Alex or Anna's biological mother; they were the product of a cousin of the man Alex thought was her father. Charlotte had convinced the mother that one of her twins had been stillborn, and then smuggled the child (Alex) out of the hospital, raising her as her own. Alex was devastated to learn her entire life had been a lie and that she had a sister she never knew. With Charlotte out of the way, Alex expected to settle down with Edmund, but within a few days Dimitri revealed himself to her. He had been kidnapped by Charlotte's thugs and had fought with all his strength to keep Alex safe and bring her \\"mother\\" to justice. Alex was overjoyed to see him again and they made love immediately. Although Alex still felt strong emotions for Edmund, she felt a stronger bond with Dimitri and could not leave her husband's side again. Edmund grew increasingly irrational and both Dimitri and Alex were frightened by his behavior. In late 2000, she vanished while on board the Fidelity yacht. Dimitri was convinced Edmund was behind the kidnapping, but after a few months, he received a phone call. Alex was safe, but hidden away in secluded Canadian woods. She asked Dimitri not to track her down, but he and Edmund ignored her wishes. They burst into a cabin where they found an old man taking care of her. They were blindsided when Alex walked into the room and said the seriously ill woman was her twin sister, Anna. The old man, Bart, had been taking care of Anna for years, but her seizures and fever had grown worse and worse. He tracked Alex down that night on the Fidelity and asked her to help treat her sister. Alex had agreed to join him, and since Anna couldn't be taken to a hospital since Charlotte was still out to kill her, had left Dimitri behind. Unfortunately, Anna was beyond the point of anything but extensive hospital care saving her. Alex flew Anna and Bart to Pine Valley (Bart died a few weeks later) and placed her in a private PVH wing. They pretended Alex was seriously ill from fever and needed care, but one by one other doctors began to find out the truth. With their help, Anna was treated and released. She hid out at Wildwind as she tried to get back her strength and her lost memories. This placed the entire family in danger, but Edmund and Dimitri insisted Anna stay put. A mute young man showed up soon after Anna arrived at Wildwind. He had been instructed to kill her but couldn't go through with his job. He was another victim of Charlotte's brainwashing and as Alex quickly found out, she and Anna's half-brother. Despite Dimitri's refusal to believe his story, Alex accepted the boy (Gabriel) and tried to make him feel welcome. After a lifetime of loneliness, she was delighted to have two new siblings. In the midst of this turmoil, Dimitri and Edmund's niece, Gillian, whom Alex was very close to, had agreed to make a documentary about her life. The documentarian, a woman named Ilene, was eager to see the plans of Wildwind. Her eagerness was due to her actually being Charlotte's hitwoman! Alex and everyone else found this out moments too late, as Ilene saw a woman from the back, mistook her for Anna, and shot her at close range. The woman was not Anna, but Gillian. Gillian died from her wounds, and even though Ilene was arrested, gave Charlotte up, and was deported to face serious charges, Alex was overwhelmed with remorse. Erica Kane went out of her way to declare Alex a \\"curse on the entire family.\\" Alex knew some other family members agreed and were just too polite to say so. Anna, however, vigorously defended her sister, putting Erica in her place over it on several occasions. Guilt-ridden about the constant danger and death she'd carried with her since her arrival at Wildwind, and perhaps still unsure of her feelings for Edmund, Alex left with Dimitri in 2001 to track down a family mystery and eventually settle down in Hungary. It is revealed in June 2013 that Alex and Dimitri got a divorce, but the date of the divorce is not revealed. In 2017, Alex assumes the identity of Anna for one-month; during this time, she seduces Valentin Cassadine to steal the Chimera Project. When she is caught by Anna and the WSB, she contacts Valentin to help her with her legal issues and, in return, would help him with his own legal issues. Alex returns to Port Charles in 2019, at the request of Anna, following Anna's own inquiry about her memories and Alex's one-time involvement with Dr. Arthur Cabot (Time Winters).

Early life (1889-1907) Yasujir≈ç Tsutsumi was born on 16 March 1889 in the rural farming village of Yagisho, Shiga Prefecture. The Tsutsumi family were held in great respect and regard, serving as village elders and headmen. However, little is known about their antecedents or origins, and there is no evidence that the traditional extended family unit ever existed in their case. Yasujir≈ç's father, Yujiro, died of typhoid fever in 1893, when Yasujir≈ç was four, also leaving his wife, Miwo, and a daughter, Fusako, who had been born in 1891. Following his father's premature death, Yasujir≈ç's mother left to return to her family, never to be heard from again, an event that haunted Yasujir≈ç to the end of his days. After his mother's separation, both Yasujir≈ç and his sister were raised by their paternal grandfather Kiyozaemon, a stern traditionalist who wished Yasujir≈ç to take over the family lands and remain a farmer. However, Yasujir≈ç had no such intentions. Since the Restoration, tremendous change had swept Japan, which was seeing a period of remarkable expansion and industrialisation. Though eager to be a part of this new era, he had little choice but to bide his time for the moment when he could break free. Career Kiyozaemon died in 1907, creating the opportunity for Yasujir≈ç to break free. In 1909, he mortgaged the family estate for 5000 yen. With this money, he married Nishizawa Koto and had a daughter, Shukuko, in 1909, then attended Waseda University investing in rough land and businesses. At the time, however, rough land had little value and was looked upon as a foolish investment. Still, Yasujir≈ç persisted. In 1917, he purchased of land for 30,000 yen from a village near the fashionable mountain resort of Karuizawa, and built several vacation houses and cottages. With this, he established a company, Hakone Resorts Ltd. Japan had prospered greatly during the First World War, initiating a period of prosperity and democracy the likes of which Japan had never experienced before. Yasujir≈ç's wealth and empire expanded proportionally with this boom. Customers came, and by 1923, Hakone Resorts Ltd had a value of 20,000,000 yen. On 1 September 1923, the Great Kant≈ç earthquake convulsed Japan and destroyed most of Tokyo. Yasujir≈ç's properties escaped damage, and his empire continued to spread. Around this time, Yasujir≈ç was called upon to handle the financial affairs of one Aoyama Yoshizo, a gentleman of a patrician noble family who had gone bankrupt. Aoyama had four daughters, all extremely beautiful, and Yasujir≈ç fell in love with them at once. He had forceful affairs with the second and youngest daughters; from those affairs, a son, Seiji Tsutsumi, was born in 1927 by the second daughter, and a daughter, Kuniko, was born by the youngest daughter in 1928. However, it was the third daughter, Misao, whom he coveted, and yet, she refused all his advances until finally, in order to preserve the family honour, she yielded to Yasujir≈ç as a mistress. For Aoyama, however, the damage was complete. Traumatised, he committed suicide. Yet, Yasujir≈ç had at last found a strong woman to match himself. Misao adopted Seiji and Kuniko as her own. In the meanwhile, Yasujir≈ç had entered politics; in 1924, he had been elected as a member of the Diet, soon becoming parliamentary vice-minister. He soon turned his attention away from Misao and sought other mistresses, especially one Ishizuka Tsuneko, the daughter of a close friend, with whom he would have three sons. The first, Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, born in 1934, was destined to play a significant role later on. War years (1937-1945) By the mid-1930s the Great Depression had set in, and militarists and nationalists were in control of the government. Yasujir≈ç expanded his interests to railways and tramlines, eventually absorbing his competitors into Hakone Resorts Ltd. Among the competitors was a rail company called Seibu, whose name Yasujir≈ç eventually took for his concern, eventually changing the name of Hakone Resorts Ltd. to Seibu. In the late thirties, he built an imposing mansion for himself and his family, which eventually became the official state house, and cultivated relationships with Japan's elite, among them General Tojo. In 1940, he took over a small department store in Ikebukuro; at the time, he thought little of it. Then came the war. During the war, Yasujir≈ç's relationships with his family grew strained: Kiyoshi, as the chonan or eldest son, would likely succeed Yasujir≈ç; however, he had never enjoyed the atmosphere in which he was forced to live in, and expressed his displeasure by refusing to submit to his father. In 1943, he was married to a girl of patrician background. Yasujir≈ç sent Fumi and Tsuneko to the country to escape the war, remaining in Tokyo with Misao and her children. He engaged in a variety of projects to aid the war effort, including a creative way of sewage disposal. Though the escalation of the war caused great hardship for most, the Tsutsumis always had enough food and shelter. By 1945, the war was in its last stages. Firebombing destroyed the family mansion, forcing the family to move to a small side house. Finally, on 15 August, Japan capitulated. Post-war (1945-1953) Shortly after the surrender, Yasujir≈ç was purged by the Occupation Government under American General Douglas MacArthur. In the meantime, Japan was in chaos. People flooded into Tokyo from the countryside. Communists thrived in the poverty-stricken Japan, delivering tirades against the wealthy and powerful. By this time, Kiyoshi's relationships with his father were at their lowest ebb. In 1946, following several loud arguments, he was disinherited. Despite this tumult, opportunity soon came for Yasujir≈ç. In 1947, MacArthur passed the Imperial Household Law. Among its provisions was that all members of the imperial family not directly connected to the emperor would become commoners and leave the family. Though they received generous settlements, each prince was also burdened with a crippling tax. Yasujir≈ç stepped in, and through several complex maneuvers lasting until 1953, bought much of the land of Prince Kitashirakawa and Prince Asaka along with Asaka's palace. Those prime properties would later become the jewels in the crown of the Seibu empire. Statesman (1953-1963) In May 1953, Yasujir≈ç was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives of Japan, and he assigned Hiroji Yamamoto and Seiji to become his secretary. At 64, he had reached the pinnacle of his long career. He remained Speaker until 1954, when he resigned following the end of the Shigeru Yoshida government. Later that same year, he formally divorced Fumi and married Misao in a private ceremony. In 1955, he assigned his heir presumptive, Seiji, to take over the department store in Ikebukuro, which had been failing for a time; under Seiji's leadership, it was transformed into one of the biggest in Tokyo. Meanwhile, Yoshiaki, Yasujir≈ç's son by Tsuneko, took charge of the core group of Seibu, Kokudo Keikaku. Yasujir≈ç then settled down to the quiet life of a distinguished former politician, traveling the world in 1961 and meeting with world leaders. Apart from a scandal involving bribery in 1963, his last years were comparatively peaceful. Death (1964) Yasujir≈ç suffered a case of cerebral anemia on 23 April 1964, and died peacefully at home on 26 April 1964, of a cerebral hemorrhage at the age of 75. He was cremated and his ashes buried in a grand tomb at Kamakura. Following his death, the empire was formally divided between Seiji and his younger half-brother Yoshiaki; Seiji receiving the retail portion and Yoshiaki taking the commercial portion. Just prior to his death, Yasujir≈ç had chosen Yoshiaki as his heir, possibly because Seiji had been briefly involved with the Japanese Communist Party after the war and as such was not completely trustworthy in Yasujir≈ç's eyes. Family and descendants Yasujir≈ç was notorious for his sexual appetite. In all, he had three wives and two mistresses by which he had seven acknowledged children, three of whom were legitimate. By all accounts, however, he had many more unacknowledged children by other mistresses and prostitutes, estimates of the number ranging from 50-100. Yasujir≈ç Tsutsumi (1889-1964) *M I.

Created by head writer Sally Sussman Morina, the role was originally played by Mandy Musgrave. The role was recast with Rachel Melvin in 2005. Melvin portrayed the character from 2005 to 2009, after the character moves to London to take care of her mother, Billie Reed. She is the child of Bo Brady and Billie Reed. Chelsea is born by the name of Georgia Reed Brady. \\"Georgia\\" is presumed dead, and buried in a bayou in Louisiana. In 2005 after Chelsea Benson's parents are killed in a car accident, DNA tests show that she is Georgia Reed Brady. Character's background Chelsea Brady is born onscreen as Georgia Reed Brady on May 22, 1998, in Louisiana. Chelsea is the long-lost daughter of Billie Reed and Bo Brady, who is initially buried in the bayou as Georgia Reed Brady in May 1998. The truth comes out when Chelsea's illegally adoptive parents are killed in a car accident and blood tests reveal her true lineage. Billie immediately steps in to care for Chelsea. Since 2006, Chelsea changes her last name to Brady, her biological father's last name. As Abby Deveraux's best friend, Chelsea is a bad influence. She encourages Abby to smoke, drink, and lie often to her mother. She also has a few driving incidents, including having her license revoked. Of course, the most serious accident results in the death of Zack Brady ‚Äî her half-brother, whom she hits while she is text messaging and driving simultaneously, thus incurring the wrath of Hope Brady and half-brother Shawn Brady. Chelsea is involved with Max Brady, who keeps Chelsea's secret about accidentally killing Zack. Chelsea is also obsessed with older men including Patrick Lockhart, who is conveniently staying at Abby's house. Seeing Billie Reed as her biggest competition, Chelsea hates her, that is, until she learned that Billie is actually her mother. After all the bad things Chelsea does, she desperately wants to change. While serving her community service at the hospital, a gloved hand leaves a file for Chelsea to discover. The file says that Claire Brady is not her cousin, the daughter of Philip Kiriakis, but actually her half-niece, Shawn's daughter. Thinking she is doing the right thing, Chelsea leaves the file in Shawn's cubicle for him to find while he lies unconscious from alcohol poisoning. She feels letting him know he is Claire's father will give him a reason to live. Belle and Shawn discover the file when he wakes up and they think the file is fraudulent because they do not remember sleeping together. The file is dusted for fingerprints and it is discovered that, apart from Shawn and Belle, Chelsea's are the only other fingerprints on the file. Bo arrests Chelsea, and Max blows up when he finds out, immediately dumping her. Bo decides that the only way to prove that Chelsea is guilty is to run the DNA test on Shawn to see if he is Claire's biological father. The tests come back positive and, in this turn of events, the charges are dropped. Chelsea then goes on a quest to get Bo and Billie back together, and consults the help of her grandmother, Kate Roberts, who encourages Chelsea to be driven and go after what she wants. The stress of losing their child has torn apart Bo and Hope and when Hope sends e-mails to Bo expressing her desire for a divorce, Chelsea intercepts the emails and writes back pretending to be Bo and agrees to the divorce even though Bo is trying to get back together with Hope. When her actions are discovered, Bo and Hope are completely enraged and Bo disown Chelsea. After many weeks of feeling guilty she talks to her father and with the support of her mother, Billie, she is able to gain back her father's trust and he welcomes her back into his life. Chelsea is then involved with a mystery lover online by the name of Dr. Shane Patten. She tells him all her feelings and her deepest secrets thinking she can trust him. She even goes so far as to plan their future together. She gets so into him she wants all the details about him so she gets Abby's cousin, Nick Fallon, to find everything out for her. After giving up on Nick finding out information about Patten because Nick won't talk to her, Chelsea finally learns that Dr. Patten is really Nick all along and he is just trying to get her to like him. She is upset and hurt at Nick's actions and completely ends their friendship, saying she can never trust him again. Things became even worse between the two when Chelsea finds out that Nick had slept with her mother when she was drunk and he is depressed over the loss of Chelsea's friendship. She refuses to even be in the same room as Nick and moves out of her mother's house and moves in with her father and stepmother. Her mother desperately tries to repair their relationship, but there still remains some tension between the two. Chelsea finds even more problems when her father's house is set on fire. The fire is actually started by Willow Stark, a former prostitute and ex-girlfriend of Shawn Brady, who is hired by EJ DiMera to break into the house. The fire is started unintentionally and Willow places a hairbrush of Chelsea's in the house to try to frame her for the fire. Chelsea panics at what her father would think considering her past troubles and under the pretense of wanting to rebuild their relationship she convinces Nick, a DNA assistant, to steal the brush in order to keep her father from finding out. Nick feels extremely guilty over his actions and is not completely sure if she is telling the truth about the fire and visits Willow in jail (she is arrested for stealing Hope's jewelry) to try to figure out which version of the fire story is true. Willow steals the hairbrush from Nick, which results in Nick trying to get the hairbrush back. Willow dies struggling to get the hairbrush back from Nick. Afterwards, Chelsea admits to her father that she asked Nick to steal the hairbrush from the lab. It is believed that Chelsea truly does have romantic feelings for Nick, but due to past relationships she has trouble trusting people and has found it hard to forgive Nick, but Nick has stated that he is determined to prove to Chelsea he loves her no matter what it takes together. Chelsea and Nick bond after Chelsea is kidnapped on the campus of Salem University, with Max also stopping a bomb from going off that is strapped to her body in exchange for Atermis and DeMarquette. Then, Chelsea goes on to help have Ford Decker arrested for the rape of her two good friends Cordy and Morgan. Chelsea is not aware that Stephanie was also raped by Ford and ignores Stephanie's pleas to let Ford be. Chelsea and the girls create posters depicting Ford as a rapist and are threatened by him on several occasions, the latest being at the Brady Pub where Nick is forced to defend her. In November, Chelsea and Nick break into Ford's dorm to obtain proof that he is indeed the campus rapist. They have pictures that are illegally obtained. Chelsea's father Bo and Stephanie's father Steve are forced to confront Ford. After being appalled by the university's unwillingness to do anything to Ford, the girls lure him into their sorority house where Chelsea pretends to be interested in him. The girls drug his drink but Ford switches the drinks and Chelsea ends up drugged. In a fight on the stairs, Ford falls backwards and dies. The girls, with the help of Max Brady, bury Ford in the basement of the house. Chelsea's father Bo Brady is later admitted to the hospital for pancreatic issues. Chelsea is found to be a match and is scheduled for an experimental operation to graft some of her pancreas to save Bo. Bo's handsome and earth-friendly doctor, Dr. Daniel Jonas, (who is brought in by Victor Kiriakis) performs the surgery. He and Chelsea grew to become friends and their friendship turned into an attraction that went beyond \\"just friends\\". However Daniel fought it at first. He was older, she was his patient at one point, and he was still mourning his late wife, for which he blamed himself for her death. However, he decided follow his heart with Chelsea and they started dating. Unfortunately, the happiness did not last as Chelsea found out that Daniel had slept with her grandmother Kate before they started dating. Chelsea broke up with Daniel. Kate Roberts, her grandmother, and Dr. Jonas become involved as he treats her for lung cancer. Afterwards, she begins defending Nick Fallon, her \\"first love,\\" who is charged with Trent Robbins murder, and growing closer to her old flame, Max Brady, whom she kissed at New years dinner at Chez Rouge, suggesting that they may get back together. Max and Chelsea spend a lot more time together and old feelings come back. They both realize that they are in love with each other and that they need to be together now. Chelsea also volunteers at the hospital, where she establishes a connection with Abe and Lexie's son, Theo. Chelsea goes to England to be with her mom after Billie is involved in a car accident. She later returns to Salem and announces that she will be staying in London. She reunites with Max and they get engaged. They decide to leave Salem and move to London.

It has also been used in cats. This procedure was developed by Dr. Slobodan Tepic and Professor Pierre Montavon at the School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Zurich, in Zurich, Switzerland beginning in the late 1990s. Dr. Slobodan Tepic later founded KYON, a leading provider of veterinary orthopaedic implants, in 1999. Kyon became the first veterinary orthopedic implant company offering this procedure to veterinarians. The cranial cruciate ligament (CrCL) in dogs, provides the same function as the anterior cruciate ligament in humans. It stabilizes the knee joint, called the stifle joint in quadrupeds, and limits the tibia from sliding forward in relation to the femur. It is attached to the cranial (anterior) medial side of the interdylar notch of the tibia at one end and the caudal (posterior) side of the lateral femoral condyle at the other end. It also helps to prevent the stifle (knee) joint from over-extending or rotating. Trauma to the equivalent ligament in humans is common, and damage most frequently occurs during some form of sporting activity (including football, rugby and golf). The nature of the injury is very different in dogs. Rather than the ligament suddenly breaking due to excessive trauma, it usually degenerates slowly over time, rather like a fraying rope. This important difference is the primary reason why the treatment options recommended for cruciate ligament injury in dogs are so different from the treatment options recommended for humans. In the vast majority of dogs, the cranial cruciate ligament (CrCL) ruptures as a result of long-term degeneration, whereby the fibres within the ligament weaken over time. The precise cause of this is not known, but genetic factors are probably most important, with certain breeds being predisposed (including Labradors, Rottweilers, Boxers, West Highland White Terriers and Newfoundlands). Supporting evidence for a genetic cause was primarily obtained by assessment of family lines, coupled with the knowledge that many animals will rupture the CrCL in both knees, often relatively early in life. Other factors such as obesity, individual conformation, hormonal imbalance and certain inflammatory conditions of the joint may also play a role. Uncorrected CrCL deficiencies have been associated with meniscal damage and degenerative joint diseases such as osteoarthritis.Johnson JM, and Johnson AL: Cranial Cruciate Ligament Rupture Pathogenesis, Diagnosis, and Post operative Rehabilitation. Vet Cl of N America: Small Animal Practice 23:4, July 1993 TTA is a surgical procedure designed to correct CrCL deficient stifles. The objective of the TTA is to advance the tibial tuberosity, which changes the angle of the patellar ligament to neutralize the tibiofemoral shear force during weight bearing. A microsaggital saw is used to cut the Tibial Tuberosity off then a special titanium cage is used to advance the tibial tuberosity. A titanium plate is used to hold the tibial tuberosity in position.Apelt D, Kowaleski MP, Boudrieau RJ: Effect of Tibial Tuberosity Advancement on Cranial Tibial Subluxation in Canine Cranial Cruciate-Deficient Stifle Joints: An In Vitro Experimental Study. Vet Surg 36:170-177, 2007 By neutralizing the shear forces in the stifle caused by a ruptured or weakened CrCL, the joint becomes more stable without compromising joint congruency. TTA appears to be a less invasive procedure than some other techniques for stabilizing the deficient cranial cruciate ligament such as TPLO (Tibial Plateau Leveling Osteotomy) and TWO (Tibial Wedge Osteotomy), as TTA does not disrupt the primary loading axis of the tibia. Since KYON first developed the TTA procedure, they have pioneered a new less invasive version of the procedure known as TTA-II. This new TTA procedure delivers the same TTA outcomes with less trauma, fewer implants, a simplified technique and at a reduced cost. Recently, TR BioSurgical has developed a bioscaffold to be used for veterinary osteotomies as a substitute for autologous cancellous bone grafting.Pullen CM, Kellerman JW, Woods CW: TR Matrix BioScaffold: A New Substitute for Autologous Bone Graft in Tibial Tuberosity Advancement. Internal Report-Tr BioSurgical Clinical Trial; Dec. 2008 In 2012 TTA RAPID was introduced by the German manufacturer RITA LEIBINGER Medical GmbH & Co. KG in cooperation with the University of Ghent, Belgium. The TTA RAPID implant is a biocompatible sponge-construction which combines a wedge-cage with a plate on the top. In this way there is only one implant needed for the whole TTA surgery. It is called \\"rapid\\" because the implantation is very quick, easy to learn and offers a high stability. The surgery is based on the Maquet-Hole- Technique. http://www.tta-rapid.com, Official Website Alternative procedures * Tibial-plateau-leveling osteotomy * Tightrope CCL * Triple tibial osteotomy * Simitri Stable in Stride * Cranial tibial wedge osteotomy  References  4\\\\.

It was contested by the Western Conference champion Colorado Avalanche and the Eastern Conference champion Florida Panthers, two teams in the Finals for the first time. Colorado defeated Florida in a four-game sweep to win their first Stanley Cup becoming the seventh post-1967 expansion team and the second former WHA team (after the Edmonton Oilers) to win the Cup. Colorado's Joe Sakic earned the Conn Smythe Trophy as MVP of the 1996 Playoffs. It was Colorado's first appearance in the Finals, in only their first season in Denver since moving from Quebec City (where they had formerly played as the Nordiques) in 1995. It was also Florida's first appearance in the Finals, in only the franchise's third season since entering the NHL in 1993. Only four other teams have made their first Stanley Cup Finals appearance faster: the Toronto Arenas winning the Stanley Cup in the NHL inaugural season in , the St. Louis Blues in their debut season in (they lost the Finals to the Montreal Canadiens), the Vegas Golden Knights in their inaugural year in , and the Cup-winning New York Rangers (who were in their second season of play, having been formed for the season). This was also the first time since the formation of the NHL in 1917 that the two teams competing for the Cup were making their first Finals appearance. Paths to the Final Colorado defeated the Vancouver Canucks, Chicago Blackhawks, and Detroit Red Wings in six games each to advance to the Finals. Florida defeated the Boston Bruins in five games, the Philadelphia Flyers in six, and the Pittsburgh Penguins in seven. Game summaries Game one The series opened on June 4, at the McNichols Sports Arena in Denver. Patrick Roy was in goal for Colorado, and John Vanbiesbrouck was between the pipes for Florida (a rematch from the 1986 Wales Conference Finals when Roy was with the Montreal Canadiens and Vanbiesbrouck was with the New York Rangers). Although Colorado was the heavy favorite in the series, Florida got on the board first on Tom Fitzgerald's goal at 16:51 of the first period. That would be all the Panthers would get, however, as Colorado scored three times within five minutes in the second period. Scott Young scored at 10:32, Mike Ricci scored at 12:21, and Uwe Krupp scored at 14:21. The Avalanche went on to win the game 3‚Äì1, with Roy making 25 saves in the victory. Game two Peter Forsberg got the Avalanche on the board first in game two, scoring an unassisted goal at 4:11 of the first period. The Panthers tied the game on Stu Barnes' power-play goal at 7:52. Rene Corbet broke the 1‚Äì1 tie with a power-play goal at 10:43, and then Forsberg scored two power-play goals of his own at 13:46 and 15:05 to complete the hat trick. Colorado led 4‚Äì1 after just one period. The Avalanche would make it 5‚Äì1 with Corbet's second goal of the game at 4:37 of the second period. Valeri Kamensky followed with a goal just 31 seconds later, and Jon Klemm scored at 10:03 to give Colorado a dominating 7‚Äì1 lead after two periods. Klemm would add another goal at 17:28 of the third period. It was the Avalanche's fourth power-play goal of the game. Colorado won the game 8‚Äì1, with three players scoring at least twice. Game three The Avalanche went to the Miami Arena in Florida with a 2‚Äì0 series lead. Claude Lemieux, back after his two-game suspension, scored the first goal of the game at 2:44 of the first period to give Colorado a 1‚Äì0 lead. Florida played determinedly, however, and tied the game on Ray Sheppard's power-play goal at 9:14. Rob Niedermayer scored at 11:19 to give the Panthers their second lead of the series. The score was 2‚Äì1 Florida after one period. At 1:38 of the second period, Colorado's Mike Keane scored a game-tying goal. Captain Joe Sakic scored the go-ahead goal just 82 seconds later, and Colorado went on to win 3‚Äì2 and take a commanding three-games-to-none lead in the series. Patrick Roy made 32 saves in the win. Game four With their backs to the wall, the Panthers played a defensive game. Florida goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck went save for save with Colorado goaltender Patrick Roy. The two teams played a marathon game that took until the third overtime period. Uwe Krupp's unassisted goal at 4:31 ended 44 minutes and 31 seconds of overtime and gave the Avalanche a 1‚Äì0 win and a four-game series sweep. Goaltender Patrick Roy stopped all 63 shots he faced. Colorado outscored Florida 15‚Äì4 in the series, and Patrick Roy stopped 147 of 151 shots, for a save percentage of .974. Joe Sakic was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP, having led all skaters in goals with 18, and points with 34. For both Patrick Roy and Claude Lemieux, it was one of their three Stanley Cup wins in 11 years. Roy and Lemieux first won the Cup in 1986 with the Montreal Canadiens. Roy won a second Cup with Montreal in 1993. Lemieux won a second cup with New Jersey in 1995. The Avalanche became the third team to win the cup after relocating: the Calgary Flames won the Cup after moving from Atlanta and the New Jersey Devils in 1995 won the Cup 13 years after they played their last game in the same city and same arena that the Avs played in as the Colorado Rockies.

Cornish Language Partnership. is a civil parish and village in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It is on the western side of Bodmin Moor, about 6 miles (10 km) north of Bodmin.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 200 Newquay & Bodmin At the 2011 census the parish population including Cooksland and Fentonadle was 919. The parish name derives from Saint Branwalader. Until the 19th century it was commonly known by the corrupt form of the name: 'Simonward'. Local amenities The village has a footpath which travels in a loop past the holy well and the church. There is a shop & office, a village hall, a football club (Brake Parc FC), a playground, a Methodist chapel, an Anglican church, a pub (The Old Inn) a war memorial hall and a primary school. Parish church The church is situated at the northern end of the village and is dedicated to St Branwalader (or Brueredus). It is a substantial building of the Norman period to which a south aisle and western tower were added in the 15th century (these additions are of granite). It was restored in the 19th century, and only parts of the Norman north arcade remain. There were in the medieval period three chapels in the parish: at Hamatethy the manorial chapel of the Peverells, St Michael's Chapel, Roughtor, and another at Chaple.Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford Thomas Taylor the historian was vicar here and edited the parish registers. St Breward feast is observed on the Sunday next after February 2.Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford; p. 10 Institute and War Memorial Hall Situated at Limehead, the Hall is fully accessible for disabled users and is equipped with Superfast Broadband, and a Smartboard with PA & Hearing Loop Systems. The Hall is used for social, education and craft activities and is also the home of the St Breward Archives, managed by the History Group. The small kitchen is well equipped for preparing and serving light refreshments. Hamatethy Manor Hamatethy Manor house and estate lies about half a mile north of St Breward. The Manor of Hamatethy dates back to before the Norman Conquest. After 1066 it was held by Count Robert of Mortain, half-brother of William the Conqueror. From the 12th to the 15th century the Manor was held by the Peverell family, then passed to the Hungerford family and later the Mitchell and Onslow families. The present manor house was built in 1924 but it incorporates some features from the demolished house at Trewinnow, Davidstow, including a doorway date 1678.Beacham, Peter & Pevsner, Nikolaus (2014). Cornwall. New Haven: Yale University Press. ; p. 508 History and antiquities Middle Moor cross The moorland area of the parish is notable for prehistoric remains, including the earthwork known as King Arthur's Hall. For many centuries St Breward's main industry was the mining of granite which has been used in Cornwall and exported to many other places. The most important quarry is De Lank which produces granite of very high quality. More recently china clay has also been quarried there. There is another important china clay works at Stannon. The most important prehistoric remains are the earthwork already mentioned, the Fernacre stone circle and two other stone circles (one 2.5 miles north-east and the other near Leaze Farm). The first of these has 76 stones in the circle and a single outlying stone; the latter has 16 stones but probably had 22 originally.Pevsner, N. (1970) Cornwall, 2nd ed. Penguin Books Arthur Langdon (1896) records seven crosses and six cross-bases in the parish: two of the crosses are at Lanke; other crosses are at Penvorder, Deaconstow and Middlemoor.Langdon, A. G. (1896) Old Cornish Crosses. Truro: Joseph Pollard In 1998, 1999 and 2000 three seasons of archaeological recording work were undertaken at the china clay works on Stannon Down to learn more about the numerous Bronze Age remains to be found there.Jones, Andy M. (2008) \\"Settlement and Ceremony: archaeological investigations at Stannon Down, St Breward, Cornwall\\", in: Cornish Archaeology; 43-44 (2004-05), pp. 1-140 Geography In the 17th century St. Breward was two separate villages, Churchtown (higher) and St. Breward (lower). More houses were built and slowly the villages merged into one. There are several main parts to the village: Churchtown, Rylands, Row, Limehead, Wenford, Penvorder, Higher Penquite and Lower Penquite. The bridge and hamlet of Wenfordbridge and Tuckingmill lies on the River Camel at the boundary of St Breward parish with the neighbouring parish of St Tudy. The parish includes a moorland area which contains Rough Tor and Brown Willy, which is the highest point in Cornwall. Notable people George Martin was a priest in the Church of England who gave up his living and went to Southwark, where he became known among the poor as the 'modern St Anthony'. He was born at St Breward. Brian Hanscomb, an artist engraver, lives in the village.

History Self was founded in January 1979 by Phyllis Starr Wilson, who served as the editor-in- chief for the publication until January 1987, when she was named the founding editor. At its inception, the magazine began with many of the same philosophies it retains today, including health, fitness, nutrition, beauty and happiness, although the categories then were not as specifically named in the magazine.

However, by 1986, the news-stand sales were stagnant.

In January 1987, when Wilson became the founding editor, Valorie (Victoria) Griffith Weaver took over as editor-in-chief, but resigned within a year. In July 1988, Anthea Disney took the position of editor-in-chief and made it her goal to refresh the magazine‚Äôs image. In the one year she held that position, she reworked the content by seeking out renowned authors such as Ann Hood, Susan Allen Toth, Alice Adams, Helen Mohr and Elizabeth Benedict to supply the magazine with fresher content with a higher degree of journalistic integrity.

The screenplay by Harold Pinter is an adaptation of Anthony Shaffer's play, Sleuth. Caine had previously starred in a 1972 version, where he played Law's role against Laurence Olivier. Plot At his country estate, a writer matches wits with an actor who has stolen his wife's heart involving mind games and tricks. Cast * Michael Caine as Andrew Wyke * Jude Law as Milo Tindle The film's screenwriter, Harold Pinter, credited as \\"Man on TV\\", is seen on a television in the background interviewing another man, played by an uncredited Kenneth Branagh. The only other person seen in the film is an uncredited actress, Carmel O'Sullivan, in the role of Maggie. Production Caine had starred as hairdresser Milo Tindle opposite Laurence Olivier's novelist Andrew Wyke in the 1972 film Sleuth, with each being nominated for an Academy Award for their performance. In the 2007 film, Caine took the role of Wyke, and Law took Caine's role of Tindle.Jason Buchanan, \\"Sleuth\\" plot summary at Allmovie, rpt. in The New York Times. Retrieved 10 June 2007. This was the second time Law performed a film character originated by Caine, the first having been the title role of Alfie.

Dargis wrote that she did not like watching the film, finding it too claustrophobic: \\"Mr. Branagh fiddles with the lights, tilts the camera and hustles his hard-working actors upstairs and down and back again and into an elevator as small as a coffin built for one. He embellishes the screenplay‚Äôs every obvious conceit and word, hammering the point until you feel as if you‚Äôre trapped inside the elevator with Milo and Andrew, going up and down and up and down, though nowhere in particular.\\" In his interview with Martin A. Grove, Branagh mentions that the danger of inducing claustrophobia in audience members is a risk that he took into account in filming Sleuth: \\"What Branagh didn't do that many Hollywood directors would have done is to open the film up by, for instance, having the two men drive to a nearby pub at some point in their conversation. 'Well, it's interesting you say that,' he told [Grove], 'There were discussions about that, but we said, 'If we believe in the power of the writing here and the power of the performances, but also, frankly, if we believe in the audience and believe that the audience can find this as fascinating as I do on the pages and if we can realize it to meet all of their expectations then the claustrophobia (won't be a problem).' \\" The House Director Branagh found shooting in the house difficult yet interesting. ‚ÄúThe minimalism I found was a great challenge. The elevator was Harold's idea, so that was there and was a central feature of what we are going to bring to it.

Time film reviewer Richard Corliss indicated he was not pleased with the outcome, concluding, \\"...[I]f you consider what the exalted quartet of Branagh, Pinter, Caine and Law might have done with the project, and what they did to it, Sleuth has to be the worst prestige movie of the year.\\" Claudia Puig of USA Today was more appreciative, writing, \\"Caine and Law are in fine form bantering cleverly in this entertaining cat-and-mouse game, thanks to the inspired dialogue of Harold Pinter. They parry, using witticisms instead of swords. Then they do a dance of deception, a veritable tango. There's thievery, peril and plenty of double- crossing. (...) As directed by Kenneth Branagh, this new version is darker and more claustrophobic. In the original the house where all the action took place was Gothic and laden with gewgaws. The new domicile is stark and minimalist, and much more threatening. Branagh's version has more incipient horror and less camp.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, \\"It's no mystery that 'Sleuth' is fascinating,\\" observing that Pinter \\"has written a new country house mystery, which is not really a mystery at all in terms of its plot, and eerily impenetrable in its human relationship\\" and that \\"in 'Sleuth' what [Kenneth Branagh] celebrates is perplexing, ominous, insinuating material in the hands of two skilled actors.\\" J.R. Jones of The Chicago Reader wrote, \\"Director Kenneth Branagh has mercifully pared the action down to 88 minutes (the first movie dragged on for 138), but the final act, with its obscure homosexual flirtation, still seems to go on forever.\\" Carina Chocano, writing in the Los Angeles Times, stated: \\"The verbal sparring is so sharp [that] it's a wonder nobody loses an eye. [...] and it's an unmitigated pleasure to observe Caine and Law attack it with such with such ferocity. Sleuth is nasty fun.\\" Terry Lawson of the Detroit Free Press, criticised the performances by the lead actors, saying, \\"We're left with two suitably hammy performances by Caine and Law, who do not forget they are actors playing actors\\" Leonard Maltin, who rated the original film 4 out of 4 stars, gave this version a \\"BOMB\\" rating, the lowest rating he has ever given a Branagh film, stating that the new version \\"has every ounce of entertainment drained from it\\" and called the film \\"unbelievably bad\\".

During World War II he organized a very effective defensive perimeter around oil fields in Ploie≈üti, Romania. Career Gerstenberg began his army service in 1912 in a cavalry unit. During World War I he was sent to the Eastern Front. Later, he was transferred into the air force and flew as an observation aircraft pilot. In 1916 he joined the Richthofen Squadron led by Manfred von Richthofen. In October 1917 his plane was shot down and Gerstenberg suffered a heavy injury. Next year he returned as a non-flying officer. After the war served in several cavalry units, retiring in 1926. He rejoined the Luftwaffe in 1934 and after 1938 served as Luftwaffe attach√© at embassies in Warsaw and Bucharest. From February 15, 1942 to August 27, 1944 Gerstenberg served as the commanding general of Luftwaffe in Romania (Kommandierender General und Befehlshaber der Deutschen Luftwaffe in Rum√§nien). His most important task was to set up a defense zone around the oil refineries in Ploie≈üti, the largest single source of oil for Nazi Germany. He managed to create an effective anti-aircraft defense system against air attacks. He commanded around 25,000 men in Ploie≈üti and 11,000 near Bucharest. As a result, the first massive air attack on the fields on August 1, 1943 (US Air Force operation Tidal Wave) failed to knock out the oil production and suffered heavy losses. When Romania switched sides during World War II (August 23, 1944), Gerstenberg, with 4,000 men, entered Bucharest trying to occupy its key points. This attempt failed and his troops were encircled, in spite of Brandenburgers paratroopers dropped in as a support. On August 28, he surrendered to the Soviets and was kept in captivity until October 12, 1955. Gerstenberg died of tuberculosis.

Its route was originally planned by the Ayrshire and Galloway Railway as part of a scheme to link Ayr with Castle Douglas, but lack of funds limited the construction to a very short section connecting the iron and coal pits of the Dalmellington Iron Company with its iron works, opening in 1849. The remainder of the line opened in 1856. It was the first railway to cross the river at Ayr. At that time the main line from Glasgow terminated at a station north of the river. After opening of the line, the railway was extended eventually to Stranraer, diverging from the Dalmellington line at Dalrymple Junction, and in time this became the dominant section. The branch line was heavily dependent on traffic from the Iron Company, and when that closed down, the branch line lost its passenger service, and now only carries mineral trains from open-cast workings. The northern section of the line remains open as part of the Glasgow - Ayr - Stranraer route (2014).  History  A false start The Burnton Viaduct near Dalrymple in 2008The Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway (GPK&AR;) had reached Ayr in 1840, but its Ayr station was on the north bank of the River Ayr. (The GPK&AR; was a predecessor company of the Glasgow and South Western Railway.)Although consideration was soon afterwards given to building a line southwards into Galloway, the daunting topography of any such route delayed any action on the matter. In 1845 there was huge interest in railway investments, and a number of ambitious schemes were proposed, including a railway from Ayr to the shores of Loch Ryan, by way of Ballantrae, and sponsored by the GPKA&R;, and titled the Glasgow and Belfast Union Railway. There was also an independent British and Irish Union Railway from Dumfries via Castle Douglas to Portpatrick. Both proposals sought a connection with the ferry service from Portpatrick to Donaghadee in the north of Ireland. An Ayrshire and Galloway Railway (A&GR;) proposed to build from a junction with the Glasgow and Belfast Union at Smithston, near Patna, by way of Dalmellington to Castle Douglas, there linking with the British and Irish Union Railway. The capital was to be ¬£650,000; the company was courting the Caledonian Railway who had plans to reach Ayr across country. However the frenzied promotion of railway schemes, not all of them practicable, came to an end and in 1846. the British and Irish Union announced on 21 April 1846 that it was discontinuing its attempts to raise money for its line. The A&GR; itself found raising money difficult, and this loss of connectivity at Castle Douglas (for Dumfries) was a blow. Consideration was given to abandoning their own scheme too, but the promoters decided to proceed, and a Bill was submitted to Parliament. The preamble to the Bill was found to be \\"not proved\\"That is, the claimed benefits to the public did not justify the interference with existing rights, or that the practicability of the scheme was in doubt; or that the required 10% of projected capital had not been deposited. Beyond Dalmellington the line would have run through very sparsely populated country, with only Castle Douglas itself at its termination. and the scheme was reduced by Parliament, to run between Smithston (near Patna) and Dalmellington only, a small fraction of its intended course. The Act gave the Company running powers over the Glasgow and Belfast Union line (under consideration at the same time) between Ayr and Smithston. The Glasgow and Belfast Union Railway too was in financial difficulties, although partly funded by the profitable GPK&AR;, and after consideration, it pressed forward with its Bill, now cutting back the scheme to reach Girvan only. It received its authorising Act of Parliament on 26 August 1846. However the reality of the shortage of money for such a difficult proposition became unavoidable, and the powers were allowed to lapse without any actual construction. Dalmellington iron works System map of the Ayr & Dalmellington RailwayThe significance of Dalmellington was the substantial deposits of iron ore and of coal in the vicinity, as well as some limestone. The proximity of these minerals made the foundation of an ironworks feasible. Henry Houldsworth developed the mining and in 1846 founded an ironworks. He established tramways for local conveyance but wished to encourage the construction of the main line railway to facilitate internal transport, and more importantly transport to market. A heavily reduced scheme The 1846 authorisation was hardly practicable, and in the 1847 Parliamentary session a further Bill was presented, after consideration with Houldsworth (as the dominant potential customer) as to the way forward. With the Glasgow and Belfast Union Railway scheme abandoned, the A&GR; now needed to build from Ayr instead of Smithston. The GPKA&R; undertook to purchase the shares for ¬£100,500, and the A&GR; undertook to construct the section between Drumgrange, near Waterside, and Sillyhole as a first priority, to give Houldsworth the connection between the iron workings and the works, that he required. The distance was about 2 miles (about 3 km), and the section was \\"to be given over to [his company] to be worked by horsepower\\". The Ayrshire and Galloway (Smithstown & Dalmellington) Railway, received the Royal Assent on 8 June 1847. The shareholders met on 22 November 1847 but too few attended to form a quorum, and the vote on sale to the GPK&AR; could not be put to the meeting. The GPK&AR; was in no hurry to finalise the matter, although it had purchased a large block of shares, and the delay in completion of the line led to heavy criticism by shareholders. On 7 November 1849 the Drumgrange to Sillyhole section was completed and \\"handed over\\" (on a toll usage basis) to the Dalmellington Iron Company, ostensibly for horse operation, although the company did use small industrial locomotives. The severe money shortage took its toll: in 1850 it was noted that the A&GR; had made no effort toward constructing the remainder of its line, and that a lack of maintenance on the open section was showing itself. The company had failed to pay several creditors, and they obtained a warrant for \\"arrest\\" of the rental payments from the Iron Company. The G&SWR; is formed The GPK&AR; became renamed the Glasgow and South Western Railway on 25 October 1850, absorbing the Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway. At this time the Ayrshire and Galloway made a final call on subscribers to its shares. The G&SWR; was now the largest shareholder, and after some prevarication paid up ¬£16,651. It then took direct control of the A&GR;, installing its own directors. Extending the line By 30 June 1851, the A&GR; line had been completed from Sillyhole to Dalmellington, a distance of only a few hundred yards. However it was not opened at this stage, as only the mineral working north of Sillyhole was in effect. The G&SWR; evidently saw no benefit in completing the lien to Ayr, until negotiations with the Dalmellington Iron Company resulted in a commitment from them to guarantee a 4% return on capital (of ¬£150,000) for ten years. Thirteen miles (20 km) of new railway needed to be built. The original compulsory purchase powers had expired, so a new Act needed to be obtained; this was passed on 4 August 1853. The line would be from Falkland Junction, immediately north of the G&SWR; \\"Ayr\\" terminus, to Drumgrange. A line to Girvan was being planned now, and it would diverge from the Ayr and Dalmellington line and have running powers from Ayr, in contrast to the 1845 proposal where the A&GR; line was to have diverged from the G&BUR; and have running powers over that line. The line opened to goods and mineral trains on 15 May 1856. the opening to passengers was delayed due to washouts of earthworks, but it took place on 7 August 1856. The line was difficult to work, with gradients of 1 in 70 and 1 in 90 climbing to Dalmellington, and numerous mineral tramway connections. At Ayr it diverged (considered in the southward direction) from the G&SWR; Ayr line at Falkland Junction, crossing the River Ayr. A new through station at Townhead was provided, a temporary structure until 1 July 1857. The line was worked by the G&SWR;, but ordinary G&SWR; trains continued to use the old terminus on the north side of the River Ayr until January 1860 when it was downgraded to goods depot status, all passenger trains using the new through station. Later history The GS&WR; was working the line and had paid most of the cost of construction; it was only a matter of time until they took over the company, and they did so on 1 August 1858 (by Act of 28 June 1858). The Ayr and Maybole Junction Railway had been authorised in 1854, and opened to goods traffic on 15 September 1856, and to passengers on 13 October 1856. That line too was worked by the G&SWR.; It diverged from the Dalmellington line at Dalrymple Junction. The G&SWR; saw it as another stage of an extension to Stranraer, and that objective was achieved in 1877. The Dalmellington line continued operating a heavy mineral service, and the long Stranraer line had a chequered existence. However, in time it came to be thought of as the main line, and the Dalmellington line was a branch. In 1872 a mineral line was opened from Cronberry to Newton-on-Ayr with a branch from Annbank to Holehouse Junction, on the Dalmellington line. The entry at Holehouse faced Dalmellington. Passenger trains from Dalmellington ran as far as Rankinston from 1892. The ironworks closed in 1921, since which time the mineral traffic on the branch had been devoted to extractive industries alone. The Dalmellington line had long been subordinate to the Stranraer route; the point of divergence via Dalrymple Junction. The branch passenger service closed on 6 April 1964. The line between Falkland Junction and Dalrymple Junction continues in use for Stranraer line passenger services, and mineral trains use the Dalmellington branch to access open cast mining sites near Dalmellington. The trains use the original line as far as Waterside, near Drumgrange, from where a private mineral line climbs into the hills above, and to the north of, Dalmellington. The branch is known now as the Waterside branch.

Social finance is often used to describe the lending and investment into companies who consider themselves social enterprises, charities, co-operatives, non-profits and other impact-focused organisations. The term can include community investing, microfinance, investing in socially-responsible and sustainable businesses, social impact bonds, and social enterprise lending. Outcome-based philanthropic grantmaking and program-related investments, sometimes referred to as venture philanthropy, also fall under the umbrella of social finance. A social investment loan is not a grant or donation; it‚Äôs repayable, often with interest.https://www.cafonline.org/charities/borrowing/social-investment These approaches to investment and funding share the twin focus of stimulating positive social and environmental returns for investors and the larger world. Some social investors try to effect environmental return, which is referred to as a regard for a triple bottom line. Similarly, it can be seen as 3D investing, which accounts for risk, return and impact for consideration by investors. Investors includes charitable foundations, retail investors, credit unions, banks, and institutional investors  History  Despite being a very modern concept, social finance has roots that can be traced back nearly 60 years. Extensive evidence suggests that many elements of what we know as social finance today were inspired by the Islamic financial system of the sharia-compliant Islamic economies of the 1960s. Elements of social finance can also be found in some European economies of the 1970s. In 1977 in the USA, the Community Reinvestment Act provided the impetus for financial institutions to invest in undeserved local regions and marginalised sectors of the economy. This has spawned a plethora of community Development Financial Institutions (DFIs) that deploy significant amounts of capital in affordable housing, renewable energy and financial inclusion across the United States. Furthermore, many prominent foundations ‚Äì such as the Ford, Rockefeller and MacArthur Foundations ‚Äì have actively invested their endowments in a manner that aligns with this practice of mission-related investing.  Market structure  The social finance ecosystem continues to evolve but is generally composed of four key groups. The first, reflecting the initial supply of private capital, comprises asset owners including private foundations and high-net worth individuals. This group serves as the primary source of capital in social finance. The second comprises asset managers, the institutional stewards of capital, including financial institutions and pension funds, who match the supply and demand of capital. The third group reflects the demand for investment from businesses that absorb social finance investments and invest this money in social and environmental projects on behalf of their investors (from group 1). Finally, there exists a layer of intermediaries (regulators, trade groups and service providers) that facilitate the myriad of connections between these three groups.

He supported the aviation companies such as Junkers and Dornier, in their respective projects to produce the Ju 89 and Dornier Do 19 competitors for the Ural Bomber production contract competition. Wever outlined five key points to air strategy: > 1\\\\. To destroy the enemy air force by bombing its bases and aircraft > factories, and defeating enemy air forces attacking German targets. > 2\\\\. To prevent the movement of large enemy ground forces to the decisive > areas by destroying railways and roads, particularly bridges and tunnels, > which are indispensable for the movement and supply of forces > 3\\\\. To support the operations of the army formations, independent of > railways, i.e, armored forces and motorised forces, by impeding the enemy > advance and participating directly in ground operations. > 4\\\\. To support naval operations by attacking naval bases, protecting > Germany's naval bases and participating directly in naval battles > 5\\\\. To paralyze the enemy armed forces by stopping production in the > armaments factories.Corum 1997, p. 138. However, after his death, other strategists, like Ernst Udet and Hans Jeschonnek favored smaller aircraft as they did not expend as much material and manpower. They were proponents of the dive-bomber (Junkers Ju 87) and the doctrine of close support and destruction of the opposing air forces on the 'battle-ground' rather than through attacking enemy industry. As a result, high-speed medium-bombers such as the Heinkel He 111, Dornier Do 17, and Junkers Ju 88 were developed, with much initial success. While some large strategic bomber programs were initiated, most notable the Ural Bomber project, which morphed into the He 117 Program, without a proponent of strategic bombing in the upper echelons of the Luftwaffe, the programs saw little progress, and would ultimately be developed too late into the war to have any meaningful effect. Walther Wever funeral On 3 June 1936 Wever flew from Berlin to Dresden, to give a lecture at the Luftkriegsschule Klotzsche to a gathering of Luftwaffe cadets. When he received the news of the death of World War I German hero Karl Litzmann, he immediately set off for Berlin. On his return journey, the Heinkel He 70 Blitz that he was flying had not been properly examined during preflight checks, and the aileron gust locks were not removed. The aircraft was airborne when the wing dipped, and the Heinkel stalled and went into a horizontal cartwheel (akin to a ground loop, but at low altitude). It crashed and exploded in flames, killing Wever and his flight engineer. That same day, the RLM issued the Bomber A heavy bomber specification and design competition for what would become the Luftwaffe's only wartime heavy bomber in production and frontline service, the Heinkel He 177. After Wever's death, a Luftwaffe bomber wing, Kampfgeschwader 4 General Wever was named after him, which fittingly enough in the later war years, would be equipped with and using in combat the one aircraft created for the design competition that started on the day of General Wever's death, the Heinkel He 177A. His son, also named Walther Wever, was a fighter pilot who was killed in action in April 1945. Notes and citations  References  * Corum, J.F.

A manga adaptation by Zekky≈ç started serialization in the September 2007 issue of the sh≈çnen manga magazine Dengeki Comic Gao!, published by MediaWorks. The manga ended serialization in Dengeki Comic Gao! with the March 2008 issue, but continued serialization in ASCII Media Works' manga magazine Dengeki Daioh with the May 2008 issue. An Internet radio show was broadcast between September 2008 and May 2009 hosted by Animate TV. A 25-episode anime adaptation produced by J.C.Staff aired in Japan on TV Tokyo between October 2008 and March 2009. A Blu-ray Disc (BD) box set containing an original video animation episode was released on December 21, 2011. NIS America licensed the anime and released it in North America in two half-season DVD collections in July and August 2010, with an English dubbed BD collection to be released in July 2014. A visual novel based on the series was released in April 2009 by Bandai Namco Games for the PlayStation Portable. The title Toradora! is derived from the names of the two main characters Taiga Aisaka and Ry≈´ji Takasu. Taiga's name is almost homophonic with from English tiger (the final a is more lengthened in the English loanword), which is synonymous with the native Japanese word . Inversely, means dragon, and is synonymous with , the English word dragon transcribed into Japanese. Plot Ryuji Takasu is frustrated at trying to look his best as he enters his second year of high school. Despite his gentle personality, his eyes give him the appearance of an intimidating delinquent. He is happy to be classmates with his best friend Yusaku Kitamura, as well as the girl he has a crush on, Minori Kushieda. However, he unexpectedly runs into \\"the school's most dangerous animal of the highest risk level\\"‚ÄîTaiga Aisaka‚Äîwho just happens to be Minori's best friend. Taiga has a negative attitude towards others and has a habit of snapping violently at people. She takes an instant dislike to Ryuji, and it turns out she is living in an apartment facing Ryuji's house. When Ryuji discovers that Taiga has a crush on Yusaku, and Taiga finds out about Ryuji's affections towards Minori, they make an arrangement to help set each other up with their crushes. Over the course of the series, Ryuji and Taiga try to set up romantic situations to help each other get to know their friends, but many of the situations backfire. Their classmates observe that they are spending a lot of time with each other, leading to rumors that they might be a couple. Although Ryuji and Taiga try to dispel the rumors, they find that they do enjoy each other's company, with Taiga visiting Ryuji's house to share meals, and Ryuji checking up on Taiga to get her to school, and cleaning for her. They meet Yusaku's childhood friend Ami Kawashima, a popular teen model who transfers into their school. She appears to be friendly and is a self- proclaimed ditz, but beneath her facade is a rather mean and spoiled brat, and she quickly finds herself at odds with Taiga. In spite of this, Taiga tries to put up with her antics as Yusaku wants them to all get along, and Ami begins to grow feelings for Ryuji. The series follows the lives of these friends and how love blossoms among them. Characters Main characters The main characters of Toradora! (from left to right): Ryuji, Yusaku, Taiga, Minori, and Ami. ; : :The viewpoint character of the light novels, Ryuji is introduced as a second-year high school student with a mistaken reputation of being a delinquent because of his sanpaku (glaring) eyes of which resemble his father's. He lives with his single mother, his father having left before he was born. Because of this, Ryuji has learned to be self-sufficient: he cooks and cleans, the latter to the point of compulsively cleaning up any messes he can find. While he looks intimidating, he is actually a very kind and selfless guy, and takes care of his mother and his friends. He has a pet parakeet named He has a longstanding crush on the cheerful and pretty classmate Minori Kushieda. After Ryuji meets Taiga Aisaka, he often helps her with domestic chores, and develops a new reputation as the \\"only person able to stop the Palmtop Tiger\\" as well as having to fend off rumors that the two might be a couple. Although he does not have a romantic interest in Taiga, he determines he wants to look after her, help her out as much as possible, and to be friends with her. :Due to the misunderstandings caused by his appearance, as well as his family situation, he tends to have low self-esteem. In spite of this, he is rather calm in most situations and is responsible, smart, and has great grades, even compared to Yusaku Kitamura, his best friend. In seeming contrast to his intimidating looks, Ryuji actually prefers avoiding serious conflicts and tends to put others first, to the point of losing sight of what he really wants in life. :In the light novels, he sees a tender side of Taiga that she hides from everyone. In the anime, he is dense when it comes to girls' feelings, especially when it comes to Taiga, Minori, and Ami. While initially seen as intimidating by most, he still manages to make good friends. His relationship with Taiga begins to change as he spends more time with her throughout the series. Eventually, he falls in love with Taiga and they become a couple at the end of the series. ; : :The other title character of the series, Taiga is a girl in Ryuji's class. She has a beautiful appearance, but dislikes the company of others, with the exception of her best friend Minori Kushieda. Because of her tendency to snap fiercely at others, and because of her diminutive stature (4 feet 8 inches in manga, 4 feet 7 inches in anime), Taiga's nickname is . She often receives confessions of love from boys due to her cute, or as Ryuji puts it, \\"doll-like\\" appearance, but she turns down every single one. Despite her reputation, she is actually a clumsy girl who is very shy and awkward around her crush Kitamura. Despite coming from a well-to- do family, her life with them was very difficult because of various problems. She lived with her father and step-mother and constantly fought with them, eventually moving out and living on her own. Having come from a privileged household, she does not know how to do any domestic chores. Upon meeting Ryuji and learning of his domestic talents, she relies on him to cook for her. Aside from sleeping in her own apartment and going to school, she spends most of her time at Ryuji's house, so much so that his mother considers her a member of the family. Eventually she falls in love with Ryuji and they become a couple at the end of the series. ; : :Minori is a cheerful classmate who is Ryuji's crush and Taiga's best friend. She is captain of the girls' softball club. She tends to be air-headed at times, although it is later revealed that she is very perceptive, being one of the few people to see Ryuji for the gentle person he is, and is also not fooled by Ami's facade. When she hears rumors that Ryuji and Taiga are a couple, she pulls both of them aside and begs Ryuji to take good care of Taiga. She works many part-time jobs preferring to keep herself busy. She enjoys food, having once made a whole tub of pudding, and teaming up with Taiga as a struggling \\"diet soldier\\". She is capable in cooking and cleaning as a result of her part-time jobs as well as taking care of her little brother while both her parents work. She is fascinated by ghosts and hopes to meet one someday, and one time, she opens up with her feelings about love to Ryuji. ; : :Yusaku is Ryuji's classmate and initially his only friend. He is the vice-president of the student council, the class representative, and captain of the boys' softball club. Yusaku wears glasses, and has a diligent personality. Although he thinks he is poor at talking to girls, Ryuji observes that Yusaku is actually quite popular with them. When Taiga confesses to him, he reveals that he had actually confessed to Taiga a year prior because she was so beautiful, but was rejected. While not buried in student council activities, Yusaku exhibits an eccentric personality as demonstrated in a bonus chapter where he plays the President card game without any clue of the rules, and a summer trip story where he wears just a towel around and randomly flashes the girls. In a later storyline, it is revealed he had a crush on the student council president Sumire Kan≈ç, but got so depressed over her departure that he bleached his hair. His nickname is \\"Maruo\\". ; : :Ami is Yusaku's childhood friend who transfers into his class midway through their second year of high school. She has been working as a fashion model, and is very popular with the guys and girls. However, behind the facade is a spoiled brat who looks down on everyone that she isn't trying to impress. Yusaku hopes that Ami will be honest with her true character, and not have such a dual nature. She develops a fierce rivalry with Taiga, and flirts with Ryuji to demonstrate how she can easily manipulate him to take him away. However, Ryuji and the other main characters are all aware of her true nature. In the storyline where she is trying to evade a stalker, she ends up depending on Ryuji and Taiga, although the latter blackmails her using footage of Ami's singing and reciting a list of Pokemon. After seeing Taiga standing up to the stalker, she drops her sweet facade in front of Ryuji to chew out the stalker, and later asks Ryuji if he would come to love her real self. Taiga calls her a dumb chihuahua, even though Ami has no idea how such a description applies. She comes from a rich background; her family has a lavish vacation home that she takes Ryuji (and the gang) over the summer. Over the course of the series, she becomes attracted to Ryuji despite regularly teasing him. Supporting characters ; : :Ryuuji's parakeet. Her name is the Japanese word for parakeet. Though apparently healthy, she sometimes looks sickly. Despite struggling to say her simple name (a running gag throughout the series), she has a good understanding of human speech and can interact with her owners and pronounce words much more difficult than her name. She seems to be mentally inept. ; : :Ryuji's mother who works nights at a hostess bar. She acts childish and like an airhead, depending on Ryuji to cook and clean for her. She is often seen getting in trouble with the landlady for whatever shenanigans go on in their apartment. She is proud that Ryuji is able to go to high school, something she was not able to complete. She initially claims that her husband died before he was born, but it is later revealed that he left her instead. She instantly takes a liking to Taiga and treats her like a family member. ; : :Yuri is Ryuji's homeroom teacher. She has a reputation of telling long stories that class representative Kitamura stops immediately to dismiss the class. She likes to do things at her own pace and is timid towards Taiga's way of speaking out. In the fifth volume of the light novel, she becomes concerned about getting into a relationship leading to marriage before she turns 30, but when that birthday comes, she develops a twisted and depressed personality, which is further aggravated whenever Taiga mentions that she is single. ; : :K≈çji is Ryuji's classmate who has long hair. He is regarded as a class 'idiot' and that opinion is deepened by his poor school marks and overly energetic behavior, stating obvious things like how pretty Ami is. His childish pranks often target Taiga and as a result he has been the victim of her violent outbursts. Despite his overly energetic behavior, later in the series he is revealed to have a girlfriend. ; : :Hisamitsu is a male student in Ryuji's class who wears glasses. He was also in Ryuji's class the previous year and is on good terms with him. He is first seen during the basketball warmup scenario where he pairs up with Minori. Noto begins to develop feelings for Maya Kihara following an argument they had during the class winter ski trip. ; : :Maya is Ryuji's attractive classmate who often hangs out with Nanako. She is a kogal and the center of the 'stand out group' of girls of class 2-C. She ends up pairing with Yusaku in basketball warmups. She has a crush on Yusaku, and she circuitously opposes the idea of Taiga and Yusaku being a couple, and wants Taiga and Ryuji to be together. ; : :Nanako is a female student in Ryuji's class who often hangs out with Maya and Ami. ; : :Sumire is the student council president. She has a strong-minded personality and inspires fellow students to follow her. Her parents own a supermarket. Because she always gets the top marks for her class each year, her notes become one of the sought-after prizes in the school festival event. When she tells the council she plans to leave school early to study in the United States to become an astronaut, Yusaku is heartbroken that he dyes his hair and quits the council. ; : :K≈çta is a first-year student who is the main character in Toradora Spin-off!. He is generally unhappy about his life. He works on the student council in general affairs, and gets good grades. When first seen, he has a completely mistaken idea what the term \\"Palmtop Tiger\\" refers to, and develops an insane crush on Taiga. He later develops a crush on Sakura, and eventually succeeds in starting a romantic relationship with her.

The architecture of the Philippines (Filipino: Arkitekturang Pilipino) reflects the historical and cultural traditions in the country. Most prominent historic structures in the archipelago are influenced by Austronesian, Chinese, Spanish, and American architectures. During three hundred thirty years of Spanish colonialization, the Philippine architecture was dominated by the Spanish influences. The Augustinian friars, along with other religious orders, built many grand churches and cathedrals all over the Philippine Islands. During this period the traditional Filipino Bahay na bat√≥ (Filipino for \\"house of stone\\") style for the large houses emerged. These were large houses built of stone and wood combining Filipino, Spanish and Chinese style elements. After the Philippines was ceded to the United States as a consequence of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898, the architecture of the Philippines was dominated by American aesthetics. In this period, the plan for the modern City of Manila was designed, with many neoclassical architecture and art deco buildings by famous American and Filipino architects. During World War II, large portions of Intramuros and Manila were destroyed. Many heritage districts in the provinces were burned down by the Japanese before the end of the war. In the reconstruction period after the Second World War, many of the destroyed buildings were rebuilt, however, a majority of heritage structures, especially in the provinces, were lost and never rebuilt. Most of the structures that were lost are considered a focal properties of former heritage towns. In the late 20th century, modern architecture with straight lines and functional aspects was introduced, particularly in the Brutalist architecture that characterized government-built structures done in the Marcos period. During this period many of the older structures fell into decay due to the imposition of martial law. After the return of democracy in 1986, a new age of Philippine architecture came into focus through modernism. Early in the 21st century, a revival of the respect for the traditional Filipino elements in the architecture returned. There have been proposals to establish a policy where each municipality and city will have an ordinance mandating all constructions and reconstructions within such territory to be inclined with the municipality or city's architecture and landscaping styles to preserve and conserve the country's dying heritage sites, which have been demolished one at a time in a fast pace due to urbanization, culturally-irresponsible development, and lack of towns-cape architectural vision. Such policies are used by countries which have preserved their architectural marvels, and entire cities as a whole, for hundreds of years, such as Italy, France, Romania, Germany and Spain. The proposal advocates for the usage and reinterpretations of indigenous, colonial, and modern architectural and landscaping styles that are prevalent or used to be prevalent in a given city or municipality. The proposal aims to foster a renaissance in Philippine landscaping and townscaping, especially in rural areas which can easily be transformed into new architectural heritage towns within a 50-year time frame. Unfortunately, many Philippine-based architecture and engineering experts lack the sense of preserving heritage townscapes, such as the case in Manila, where business proposals to construct structures that are not inclined with Manila's architectural styles have been continuously accepted and constructed by such experts, effectively destroying Manila's architectural townscape one building at a time. Furthermore, the singular architectural proposal has yet to be manifested into an actual policy due to the lack of a Department of Culture. Only the city of Vigan has passed such an ordinance, which led to its declaration as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999 and awarding of various recognition for the conservation and preservation of its unique architectural and landscaping styles. In 2016, senator Loren Legarda filed a bill establishing the Department of Culture. The bill was introduced in the Senate in January 2017 and is expected to be passed into law in late 2018 or early 2019. The bill is backed by 9 other senators from different political parties, namely, Bam Aquino, Nancy Binay, Francis Escudero, Juan Zubiri, Joseph Ejercito, Joel Villanueva, Sherwin Gatchalian, Risa Hontiveros, and Sonny Angara. Three counterpart bills that aim to establish a Department of Culture has also been filed in the House of Representatives, authored by Christopher de Venecia, Evilina Escudero, and Jose Antonio Sy-Alvarado.Luengo, Pedro. Intramuros: Arquitectura en Manila, 1739‚Äì1762. Madrid: Fundacion Universitaria Espa√±ola, 2012  House structures  Bahay Kubo Houses were built in a more or less similar manner, in the same way that the settlements were built beside rivers and streams. The houses were built near rice fields and coconut groves and orchards. The houses sit on posts raised above the ground. The rooms were small, and generally, with a single multipurpose room, having only the cooking space differentiated among the areas in the houses. There is a particular architectural piece called ‚Äòbatalan‚Äô that is often situated in the rear part of the house, and is utilized for domestic work like washing, bathing, water storage, etc. The houses were made of raw material like wood and bamboo. Tree houses or houses built on trunk of trees rooted to the grounds were seen as an advantageous position. The doors of the houses were usually oriented to the direction where the sun rises and never faced towards the west, an architectural tradition which can be explained by the values and belief systems that early inhabitants of the land have. Bahay Kubo Later on the invention of various tools allowed for the fabrication of tent-like shelters and tree houses. Early Classical houses were characterized by rectangular structures elevated on stilt foundations and covered by voluminous thatched roofs ornamented with gable-finials and its structure could be lifted as a whole and carried to a new site. Examples include the Ifugao House and the Royal Nobilities' Torogan. The architecture of the classical period of the Philippines is based on vernacular architecture for most of its centuries and Islamic architecture in some coastal areas at the south, plus the interior of Lanao, after the 13th century. The bahay kubo is the term for huts built out of nipa. These types of edifices were characteristic of the way that indigenous people of the Philippines built homes prior to the arrival of the Spanish colonizers. They are still in use today, especially in rural areas. Different architectural designs are present among the different ethnolinguistic groups in the country, although most homes built along the shorelines conform to being stilt houses, similar to those found in neighboring countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and other countries of Southeast Asia. Bahay na bato The arrival of the Spaniards in 1571 brought in European colonial architecture to the Philippines. Though not specifically suited for the hot tropics, European architecture was transposed via Acapulco, Mexico into a uniquely Filipino style.234x234px In this era, the nipa hut or bahay kubo gave way to the Bahay na bato (stone house) and became the typical house of noble Filipinos. The Bahay na bato, the colonial Filipino house, followed the nipa hut's arrangements such as open ventilation and elevated apartments. The most obvious difference between the two houses would be the materials that was used to build them. The bahay na bato was constructed out of brick and stone rather than the traditional bamboo, timbre and other wooden materials that elevates the house. It is a mixture of native Filipino, Spanish and Chinese influences. During the 19th century, wealthy Filipinos built some fine houses, usually with solid stone foundations or brick lower walls, and overhanging, wooden upper story with balustrades and capiz shell sliding windows, and a tiled roof. Excellent preserved examples of these houses of the illustrious Filipinos can be admired in Vigan, Ilocos Sur. Preserved examples of \\"bahay na bato\\" are also found in Taal, Batangas and Boac, Marinduque in southern Luzon, Iloilo, Iloilo and Carcar, Cebu in the Visayas, and Dapitan, Zamboanga del Norte. During World War II, many heritage districts and towns outside Metro Manila were heavily destroyed and damaged by American and Japanese bombs. Reports of deliberate burning of colonial structures by Japanese soldiers were also rampant. Most destroyed or damaged heritage structures have never been restored and now lay in ruins or have been replaced with shanty houses or concrete structures with no significant architectural aesthetics. Many scholars have championed for Japan and America's accountability for the destruction of many Filipino architectural landscapes and towns, but to no avail. Religious structures Paoay Church, an example of Philippine earthquake baroque architecture.  Churches  The order of the Augustinians, Augustinian Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines, built many churches all over the Philippines. These magnificent structures can still be found throughout the Philippine Islands.The Paoay Church in Ilocos Norte is one of the most prominent types of these churches. This unique specimen of Filipino architecture called Filipino Baroque from the Spanish era has been included in the World Heritage Sites List of the UNESCO. The church was built by the Augustinian friars from 1694 until 1710. It shows the earthquake-proof baroque style architecture. The bell tower served as an observation post in 1896 for the Katipuneros during the Philippine revolution against the Spaniards, and again by the Filipino guerillas during the Japanese occupation in World War II. The present structure is the third to stand on the site and has survived seven major earthquakes, and the wars in Manila. The church remains under the care of the Augustinians who founded it. The church also houses the legacies of the Spanish conquistadors, Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi, Juan de Salcedo and Mart√≠n de Goiti who are buried and laid to rest in a tomb, underneath the church. The church has 14 side chapels and a trompe-l'oeil ceiling. Up in the choir loft are the hand-carved 17th-century seats of molave, a beautiful tropical hardwood. Adjacent to the church is a small museum run by the Augustinian order, featuring antique vestments, colonial furniture, and religious paintings and icons. It was named a National Historical Landmark by the Philippine government in 1976. Together with three other ancient churches in the country, it was designated as part of the World Heritage Site \\"Baroque Churches of the Philippines\\" in 1993. Iglesia Ni Cristo churches During American colonial rule over the Philippines, there were a variety of rural anti-colonial movements, often with religious undertones, and American Protestant missionaries introduced several alternatives to the Roman Catholic Church, the established church during Spanish colonial period. Iglesia ni Cristo church buildings primarily serve as places of worship and are used for other religious functions. INC Central Temple at Central Avenue, Quezon City Anthropologist Fernando Nakpil-Zialcita, said that INC churches can be uniquely identified for \\"its exuberant use of fanciful forms and ornaments\\". Churches were started to be built in this style during the late 1940s and early 1950s with the first concrete chapel built in Sampaloc, Manila in 1948. The Pioneer Concrete Structures of the Church are Mostly Influenced by Mixing Neo-Gothic and Art Deco, and some are Built in Art Deco Alone. The INC Central Temple which opened in July 27, 1984, can accommodate up to 7,000 persons, and cost about US$2 million. The Central Temple features octagonal spires, \\"fine latticework\\" and ribbed windows. Recent buildings are variations of Carlos A. Santos-Viola's designs on the Central Temple. These are designed to accommodate 250 to 1,000 persons while larger churches in Metro Manila and provincial capitals can accommodate up to 3,000 persons. Prominent architects, such as Juan Nakpil and Carlos Ra√∫l Villanueva, had been involved in designing INC churches while the Engineering and Construction Department of INC oversees the uniformity in design of church buildings. Mosques Prior to the usage of the common Islamic mosque architecture, which can also be seen in Arabia and modern architecture, the vernacular mosques of the Philippines used to be the hut-style and the pagoda-style, which were very common until the late 19th century. Most of the mosques in the Philippines today have common Islamic architectures imported from Arabia merged with modern style, though some vernacular pagoda-style mosques can still be seen in Mindanao such as the Masjid Datu Untong Balabaran of Taviran in Datu Odin Sinsuat, Maguindanao. There have been proposals to put the Heritage Mosques of the Philippines into the Philippine tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage Site declaration in the future. The proposals made were to input the historic mosques of the Philippines (mosque in Simunul), to input the vernacular mosques of the Philippines (langga/rangga-style and pagoda-style mosques), or to combine both and input them in the tentative list of UNESCO.  Fortifications  The architecture of the early Filipinos are also reflected in the historical military structures in the country. There was often competition in trade between the thalassocratic states in the archipelago. Neighboring kingdoms would often wage wars against one another to gain control of trade and territory. Fortifications were then necessary to keep their subjects and interests protected. Due to foreign attacks and colonisation, only a few of these fortresses physically remain. However, many cities in the country, such as Manila, were built on the basis of fortifications that predated the colony. During the colonisation of the Philippines, fortifications were also built by the foreign powers to assert political control in the islands. The Spanish, for example, made use of their forts against attacks from Chinese and Moro Pirates, as well as the Dutch and the British. These forts were made almost entirely of stone; hence some of them have survived numerous wars and are still standing to this day. Kuta The surviving attested forms of fortifications in the country before colonisation were the kuta (stronghold) and moog (tower). The word kuta is cognate with the Malay kota which has the modern meaning \\"city\\". Kuta, in addition to its military uses, also served as a palace for the local lord. These structures were usually made of stone and wood and were surrounded by trench networks. Kuta were notably used by Muslims for defense against foreign invaders. It is said that the Maguindanao Sultanate, at the height of their power, blanketed the area around Western Mindanao with such fortifications to prevent the Spanish from advancing into the region. However, the sultanate was eventually subdued after further Spanish campaigns in the region and majority of the kuta were dismantled. During the American occupation, insurgents still built strongholds and the sultans often had these reinforced. Many of these forts were destroyed during American attacks, which is why very few have survived to this day. Notable kuta: * Kota Seludong: the foundation of the city of Manila * Cotabato: \\"stone fort\\"; a stone fortification in Mindanao * Kota Sug/Jolo: the capital and seat of the Sultanate of Sulu; converted into a walled city by the Spanish upon occupation in the 1870s Igorot Forts The Igorot built forts made of stone walls that averaged several meters in width and about two to three times the width in height around 2000 BC. Idjang Fortifications for wartime purposes were also built by the Ivatan in the islands of Batanes. They built idjang which were a type of citadel on hills and elevated areas. These structures were designed so that the entrance was only accessible by the use of rope ladder which was only lowered for villagers to the disadvantage of the enemies. Intramuros Defensive walls of Intramuros Intramuros was the walled city of Manila along the south bank of the Pasig River. It was established to replace Kota Seludong, the seat of the power of the Kingdom of Maynila that was protected by a rammed earth fortress equipped with stockades, battlements and cannons. The historic city was once home to many colonial churches, schools, convents, government buildings and residences. Many of these products of Spanish architecture were destroyed during World War II. Of all the buildings within the 67-acre city, only one, the San Agustin Church, survived the war. Fort Santiago Fort Santiago (Fuerza de Santiago) is a defensive fortress established in 1571 by the Spanish conquistador Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi. It was the citadel of Intramuros, built on the site of the palace and of Rajah Sulayman. which was destroyed by the Spanish in 1570 while engaging in several battles with the Tagalog. El Fraile Island Fort Drum built by the Americans to guard the Islands nearby against invaders. El Fraile Island or Fort Drum, also known as \\"the concrete battleship,\\" is a heavily fortified island situated at the mouth of Manila Bay in the Philippines, due south of Corregidor Island. The reinforced concrete fortress shaped like a battleship was built by the United States in 1909 as one of the harbor defenses at the wider South Channel entrance to the bay during the American colonial period. It was captured and occupied by the Japanese during World War II, and was recaptured by the U.S. after igniting petroleum and gasoline in the fort, leaving it permanently out of commission.  Rice terraces  A rainbow appearing after the rain at the Batad Rice Terraces, one of the rice terraces in Ifugao. For years the mountainous province of Ifugao have been carefully cultivated with terraced fields. These rice terraces illustrate the ability of human culture to adapt to new social and climate pressures as well as to implement and develop new ideas and technologies. They also epitomize a harmonic, sustainable relationship between humans and their environment. The structures' original builders used stone and mud walls to carefully carve and construct terraces that could hold flooded pond fields for the cultivation of rice. They also established a system to water these plots by harvesting water from mountaintop forests. These engineering feats were done by hand as was the farming itself. Maintenance of the rice terraces reflects a primarily cooperative approach of the whole community which is based on detailed knowledge of the rich diversity of biological resources existing in the Ifugao agro-ecosystem, a finely tuned annual system respecting lunar cycles, zoning and planning, extensive soil conservation, and mastery of a complex pest control regime based on the processing of a variety of herbs, accompanied by religious rituals and tribal culture. Although popularly known as and listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage site believed to be older than 2,000 years, there are some conflicting recent studies that report that the terraces may in fact be less than 1,000 years old.  Limestone Tomb complex of Kamhantik  The Limestone tombs of Kamhantik is the site of the excavated remains of a thousand-year-old village, found in the jungles of Mount Maclayao in Sitio Kamhantik within the Buenavista Protected Landscape of Mulanay, Quezon, Philippines. The complex is composed of fifteen limestone coffins that can be dated back from the period of 10th to 14th century, with one of the National Museum's top archaeologists naming it \\"a complex archaeological site with both habitation and burial remains from the period of approximately 10th to the 14th century ... the first of its kind in the Philippines having carved limestone tombs.\\"  American period  The Manila Central Post Office is a neoclassical building built during the American period. With the arrival of the Americans in 1898 came a new breed of architectural structures in the Philippines. Foremost of the American contributions to the country was the establishment of civil government. This led to the erection of government buildings from the city all the way to the municipal level. Designed in the most respectable manner, these government houses resembled Greek or Roman architecture. The revival period, popular at the turn of the century, became the foremost architectural parlance of the era as seen in such buildings particularly in Manila. Education of the masses also became the thrust of the American occupation, as such, public education was established, foremost of which is the University of the Philippines. With American rule firmly established in the Philippines, the military government at the time invited the well-known architect and urban planner Daniel Burnham to develop Manila. Burnham's arrival led to the formation of the Burnham Plan which identifies the city of Manila as a uniquely European city in the tropics and as such opposed to develop its architecture in line with the existing style. The style of architecture, as suggested, varies little from existing architecture at the time as typified by the Manila Hotel. New structures continued the use of conventional motifs but were made of more durable materials such as concrete. This style of architecture prevailed even after the turn of the century. The Luneta Hotel, located in Kalaw Avenue, is one of the remaining structures that survived the liberation of Manila in 1945. The hotel was completed in 1918. According to Dean Joseph Fernandez of the University of Santo Tomas, the hotel was designed by the Spanish architect-engineer Salvador Farre. The structure is the only remaining example of the French Renaissance architecture with Filipino stylized Beaux-Arts architecture in the Philippines to date. At the Far Eastern University (FEU) in Quiapo, Manila, five Art Deco structures on the campus were designed by National Artist Pablo Antonio. Three were built before World War II and two, after. Although FEU buildings were totally damaged during the war, the university was restored to its original Art Deco design immediately after. The university was given a UNESCO Asia Pacific- Heritage Award for Cultural Heritage in 2005 for the outstanding preservation of its Art Deco structures.Ortiz, Margaux (January 15, 2007).\\"Art Deco buildings thrive on FEU campus\\" . Inquirer.net. Retrieved on 2011-10-10. Art Deco buildings Old Jaro municipal hall in Iloilo During the rise of cinema in the Philippines as a form of recreation, several theaters were constructed in the 1930s to 1950s in the Art Deco style designed by prominent architects now recognized as National Artists. The Manila Metropolitan Theater is an Art Deco building designed by the Filipino architect Juan M. Arellano, and built in 1935. Another fine example of Art Deco is the old Jaro Municipal Hall in Iloilo built in 1934 by Filipino architect Juan M. Arellano. It later became the Jaro District Police Station and after the full restoration is now the regional branch office of the National Museum. During the liberation of Manila by the combined American and Flipino troops in 1945, the theatre was totally destroyed. After reconstruction by the Americans it gradually fell into disuse in the 1960s. In the following decade it was meticulously restored but again fell into decay. The sculptures upon the fa√ßade of the theater are by Italian sculptor Francesco Riccardo Monti, who lived in Manila from 1930 until his death in 1958, and worked closely with Juan M. Arellano. Highly stylized relief carving of Philippine plants executed by the artist Isabelo Tampingco decorate the lobby walls and interior surfaces of the building. The Far Eastern University Manila campus is a living art museum with United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation-Asia Pacific Heritage buildings and auditorium done in the Art Deco style. The following are the Philippine architects who contributed and lead to the design of the classic Philippine theaters: * Juan Nakpil, a Philippine national artist for Architecture * Pablo Antonio * Juan M. Arellano Modern period The aftermath of World War II brought major destruction especially in the capital city of Manila and a time of rebuilding ensued. The modern era dawned on Philippine architecture using the simple straight lines of the International Modern Style as a chief mode of expression. By the 1970s, a new form of Philippine architecture emerged with the filipinization of architecture. The Filipino style found its way in the re-emergence of traditional motifs, the Bahay Kubo and the Bahay na bato became popular forms to be copied and modernized such as the Batasang Pambansa and the National Theater. By the 1980s the country's architectural idiom was swept by the tide of Post Modernism, a hearkening back of some sort to classical architecture. Today, architecture in the Philippines continue to be vibrant and with the country opening up to the world, more first rate architecture is pouring in. Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex Cultural Center of the Philippines. The Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex is home to the National Theater (Tanghalang Pambansa). The theater is the centerpiece of the 77 hectare (190 acres) arts and culture complex located along Roxas Boulevard in Manila. Designed by Leandro V. Locsin, the construction of the National Theater began in 1966 and was completed in 1969. The theater is a primary example of the architect's signature style known as the floating volume, a trait can be seen in structures indigenous to the Philippines such as the nipa hut. It houses three performing arts venues, one theater for film screenings, galleries, a museum and the center's library and archives. The fa√ßade of the National Theater is an example of Brutalist architecture. It is dominated by a two-storey travertine block suspended 12 meters (39 ft) high by deep concave cantilevers on three sides. The building is built on a massive podium, and entry is through a vehicular ramp in front of the raised lobby and a pedestrian side entry on its northwest side. In front of the National Theater and below the ramp, there is an octagonal reflecting pool with fountains and underwater lights. Aside from the National Theater, other structures located inside the CCP Complex is the Tanghalang Nicanor Abelardo or the Main Theater, Tanghalang Aurelio Tolentino or the Little Theater, Folks Art Theater and the Manila Film Center. The Parish of the Holy Sacrifice is the landmark Catholic chapel in the University of the Philippines Diliman. Known for its architectural design, the church is recognized as a National Historical Landmark and a Cultural Treasure by the National Historical Institute and the National Museum respectively. Five National artists collaborated on the project. The building was designed by the late National Artist for Architecture, Leandro Locsin. Alfredo Juinio served as the structural engineer for the project. Around the chapel are fifteen large murals painted by Vicente Manansala depicting the Stations of the Cross. The marble altar and the large wooden cross above it were sculpted by Napoleon Abueva. The mosaic floor mural called the ‚ÄúRiver of Life‚Äù was designed by Arturo Luz. Antipolo Church The image of \\"Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage\\" has been venerated in the church of Antipolo for centuries. The old church that housed the virgin was destroyed in February 1945 when the combined American and Filipino forces bombed Antipolo as part of the liberation campaign of Manila. In 1954, a new church was built designed by the renowned Filipino architect Jose de Ocampo. The Antipolo Church is of a cupolaed design centered around the image of the Virgin. It functions as the center point of the pilgrimages to Antipolo. Iloilo Convention Center The Iloilo Convention Center. The Iloilo Convention Center (also known as ICC or I-Con) is a state-of-the-art convention center in the Iloilo Business Park in Mandurriao, Iloilo City, Philippines. Its construction was completed in September 2015 in time for the APEC 2015 hosting. It is built on a 1.7-hectare of lot in the district of Mandurriao donated by the Megaworld Corp. The Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority allocated P200 million for the construction of the convention center, while another P250 million was sourced from the Priority Development Assistance Fund of Senator Franklin Drilon. The state-of-the-art convention center designed by Ilonggo architect, William Coscolluela. The design was inspired by Iloilo's Dinagyang and Paraw Regatta festivals. The paraw is a native double outrigger sailboat in the Visayas region, used in the annual Paraw Regatta Festival sailboat race. Abstract designs of the famous Dinagyang Festival are featured on the glass walls of the center. It is a two- storey structure with a total floor area of 11,832 square meters. The main hall on the ground floor has a 3,700-seat capacity and 500-seat function rooms on the second floor. A rooftop of 1,500 sqm is available for outdoor functions. United Architects of the Philippines Grand Hyatt Manila in Bonifacio Global City, Taguig is the tallest building in the Philippines since its completion in 2017 with a height of 281.78m. The United Architects of the Philippines (officially known as the Integrated and Accredited Professional Organization of Architects) is the official architectural association of the Philippines. It is the first professional organization to be accredited by the Professional Regulation Commission and it currently has 38,000 members. Heritage towns and cities The Philippines is home to numerous heritage towns and cities, many of which have been intentionally destroyed by the Japanese through fire tactics in World War II and the Americans through bombings during the same war. After the war, the government of the Empire of Japan withheld from giving funds to the Philippines for the restoration of the heritage towns they destroyed, effectively destroying any chances of restoration since the pre-war Philippines' economy was devastated and had limited monetary supply. On the other hand, the United States gave minimal funding for only two of the hundreds of cities they destroyed, namely, Manila and Baguio. Today, only the centres (poblacion or downtown areas) of Filipino heritage towns and cities remain in most of the expansive heritage cities and towns in the country. Yet, some heritage cities in their former glory prior to the war still exist, such as the UNESCO city of Vigan which was the only heritage town saved from American bombing and Japanese fire and kamikaze tactics. The country currently lacks a city/town-singular architectural style law. Due to this, unaesthetic cement or shanty structures have taken over heritage buildings annually, destroying many former heritage townscapes. Some heritage buildings have been demolished or sold to corporations, and have been replaced by commercial structures such as shopping centers, condominium units, or newly furnished modern-style buildings, completely destroying the old aesthetics of many former heritage towns and cities. This is one of the reasons why UNESCO has repeatedly withheld from inscribing further Filipino heritage towns in the World Heritage List since 1999. Only the heritage city of Vigan has a town law that guarantees its singular architecture (the Vigan colonial style) shall always be used in constructions and reconstructions. While Silay, Iloilo City, and San Fernando de Pampanga have ordinances giving certain tax exemptions to owners of heritage houses. In 2010, the Philippine Cultural Heritage Act passed into law, effectively giving protections to all cultural heritage properties of the Philippines. However, despite its passage, many ancestral home owners continue to approve the demolition of ancestral structures. In certain cases, government entities themselves were the purveyors of such demolitions. Because of the minimal reach of the current governmental culture agency and the lack of awareness on the importance of Filipino sites, a bill establishing a Department of Culture was formally filed in 2016. The bill is expected to pass into law by late 2018 or early 2019 as it was declared a priority legislation by both houses of Congress. If the bill reaches its deadline, a secretary of culture will be appointed by June‚ÄìJuly 2019.

Early life Henry was born in Southampton County, Virginia, to Captain Peter and Elizabeth (Taylor) Blow, owners of the famous enslaved man Dred Scott.Charles Van Ravenswaay, St. Louis: An Informal History of the City and Its People, 1764-1865, (Missouri Historical Society Press, 1991), 406. Blow was the eighth of ten children. He moved with his parents to Huntsville, Alabama, where his father unsuccessfully tried farming. In 1830 the family moved again to St. Louis, Missouri, where Peter Blow opened a boarding house, and hired out his slaves, including Dred Scott, who worked as a roustabout. Henry's mother died in 1831, followed by his father the next year. Henry Blow graduated from Saint Louis UniversityJohn Thomas Scharf, History of Saint Louis City and County: From the Earliest Periods to the Present Day, Volume 1, (Louis H. Everts & Co., 1883), 608. and started apprenticing in a law office, but was forced by the deaths of his parents to become a clerk in his brother- in-law Charless' business, selling paint and oil.Walter Ehrlich, They Have No Rights, (Applewood Books, 2007), 10-11. Peter Blow had left his estate to his two unmarried daughters and Henry's younger brothers, Taylor and William. Henry was only fifteen when his father died, but that was old enough to be seen as a man able to survive on his own. Henry's married sister, Charlotte Taylor Blow, also did not receive an inheritance. She married Joseph Charless, Jr. in 1831. Charless' father, Joseph Charless, had founded the first newspaper west of the Mississippi. The Charless family helped Henry after the death of his father and Henry began working as a clerk at their wholesale drug and paint company. When Joseph Charles Sr. retired in 1836, Henry was made a partner in the business. In 1838, the business was renamed Charless, Blow, and Company. Only a few years later, in 1844, the partnership was dissolved. Charless retained ownership of the drugstore and Blow kept the manufacturing firm, which was later known as Collier White Lead and Oil Company. The Collier Company was one of the largest factories in St. Louis. Chouteau's Pond, Collier's White Lead factory in background Blow & Kennett, Granby, Missouri, Collier White Lead Co. Charless, Blow, and Company was not the only business that Blow would lead. Henry and his brother, Peter, created the Granby Mining and Smelting Company. Henry also served as president of the Iron Mountain Railroad for a time and helped to establish a furnace for the iron industry in Carondelet. Henry married Minerva Grimsley (1821‚Äì1875), daughter of wealthy saddle manufacturer, Colonel Thornton and Susan (Stark) Grimsley, by whom he had nine children. Henry and Minerva were married in 1840. Henry encouraged his daughters to get an education, which was unusual for that time. One of them, Susan Elizabeth Blow, became a noted nineteenth-century educatorSusan E. Blow, Kathleen G.

In 1849, after the family's house had burned down and a cholera epidemic was sweeping St. Louis, Blow moved his family to Carondelet, which was a separate city at that time. Colonel Thornton had given the family seventeen acres there. Blow built a Victorian mansion on the land that held a library with elaborate paneling and stained glass windows that were later installed at the Missouri History Museum. Political life Despite being raised in the south, Blow was an abolitionist. Henry's parents had owned a slave, Dred Scott, who was sold to Dr. Emerson, who took Scott to Illinois and Wisconsin, which were both free territories. When Scott returned to St. Louis, Henry Taylor Blow encouraged Scott to sue for his freedom since he had lived in free states. Both men contributed money to finance the case, which made its way through the legal system, all the way to the Supreme Court. Scott later lost his bid for freedom. The court ruled that a slave is property and not a citizen. Dred Scott did eventually gain his freedom after Dr. Emerson's widow gave him to Taylor Blow, who freed Scott permanently. Blow joined the Republican Party in 1854 because of their views towards slavery. Henry Taylor Blow was elected to the Missouri Senate that year and served from 1854 to 1858.Charles Van Ravenswaay, St. Louis: An Informal History of the City and Its People, 1764-1865, 411. In 1860, Blow served as the Missouri delegate at the Chicago convention where they nominated Abraham Lincoln. Blow was appointed Minister to Venezuela in 1861 by President Abraham Lincoln, and served until the following year. In this position Blow worked to improve trade between Venezuela and the Mississippi Valley. Blow did not retain this post for long. He returned to the United States to support the Union during the Civil War. He was then elected to the United States House of Representatives as an Unconditional Unionist. Blow was elected in 1862 and 1864 and served until 1867. Blow wanted to return to his businesses in St. Louis and declined to run for reelection in 1867. Blow served on the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, which drafted the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Blow returned to politics in 1869 when he was appointed ambassador to Brazil by President Ulysses S. Grant. In 1874, Blow was appointed to the board of commissioners assigned to reorganize the government of the District of Columbia. He resigned, \\"for personal considerations,\\" only 6 months after taking office. Death and legacy Henry Taylor Blow died in 1875 at age 58 in Saratoga, New York.Carol Ferring Shepley, Movers and Shakers, Scalawags and Suffragettes: Tales from Bellefontaine Cemetery, 37. Blow's death came just three months after Minerva's death. The two were married for thirty-five years. Blow's funeral service lasted two hours and a special train was commissioned to take mourners from St. Louis to his home in Carondelet. The funeral procession was a mile long and spanned twenty-five miles to his final resting place. He was interred in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri, and was survived by six of his children. Blow helped establish many organizations in St. Louis including a Presbyterian church, the Philosophical Society, the St. Louis Philharmonic Society, the Twentieth Century Club, the Western Academy of Art, and a Carondelet public school. Blow Street, which passes through several south St. Louis city neighborhoods, is named for Blow. The H.T. Blow School in Washington, DC was named for him. It was later merged with Franklin Pierce Elementary School to create Blow-Pierce Elementary. More recently it was changed to a charter school called Friendship Blow Pierce Elementary School.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees, Detroit Tigers, Kansas City Royals and Cleveland Indians. Chamberlain played college baseball for the Nebraska Cornhuskers before the Yankees selected him in the first round of the 2006 MLB draft. He ascended through the minor leagues and made his MLB debut in 2007 as a relief pitcher during the Yankees' pursuit of a berth in the MLB postseason. The Yankees adhered to what became known as the \\"Joba Rules\\", where they carefully monitored and limited his appearances. During the 2008 season, the Yankees transitioned Chamberlain to the starting rotation, and he suffered a shoulder injury later in the season. Chamberlain struggled as a starter in 2009, and was shifted back to a relief role. He signed as a free agent with the Tigers before the 2014 season, and re-signed with the Tigers for 2015, but was released during the season. He returned to MLB later in 2015 with Kansas City and pitched for Cleveland in 2016. Early life Joba was born Justin Louis Heath on September 23, 1985. Official Player Profile on MLB.com He grew up in Lincoln, Nebraska. Chamberlain's parents, Harlan Chamberlain and Jackie Standley, were never married and split up when Joba was 18 months old. Some sources say that Harlan Chamberlain obtained full custody of Joba when he was 3 years old, but Standley claims that Joba lived with her most of the time until he was 10 when she had his surname legally changed from Heath, her maiden name, to Chamberlain. Standley began abusing drugs when Joba was 4 or 5 and says that she and Joba currently speak to each other only rarely. Chamberlain's father was born on the Winnebago Indian Reservation, but had to leave to be treated for polio. Chamberlain still has family living on Native American reservations. As of 2014, he was one of only three active non- Hispanic Native American players in Major League Baseball, with the others being Kyle Lohse of the Milwaukee Brewers and Jacoby Ellsbury of the New York Yankees. When Joba (then Justin) was a little boy, his two-year-old cousin was unable to pronounce her brother (Joba's other cousin) Joshua's name correctly, pronouncing it as Joba instead, which became his nickname over time. Joba served as a ball boy and bat boy for Lincoln Northeast High School's state championship baseball team, and eventually graduated from Northeast. He did not jump straight to college; to help pay the bills, Joba briefly worked for the city of Lincoln's maintenance department. Amateur baseball career High school Chamberlain played American Legion Baseball over the summer of 2004 for Coach Steve Eckman, going 4‚Äì4 with a 1.36 earned run average (ERA), as he struck out 137 hitters and walked only 21 en route to all-state honors. He recorded 21 strikeouts over 12 shutout innings in a matchup against future fellow Nebraska star Johnny Dorn's team, a 15-inning game won by Grand Island, 1‚Äì0. He also hit .505 with 11 homers, 11 doubles and 37 RBIs as a two- way performer. At Lincoln Northeast High School for coaches Bill Fagler and Doug Kaltenberger he garnered second-team Super State honors from the Lincoln Journal Star, going 3‚Äì2 with a 3.35 ERA, as he struck out 29 in 31.1 innings as a senior. College Chamberlain started his college career playing for the University of Nebraska at Kearney Lopers under coach Damon Day, leading the team in ERA (5.23), opponents' batting average (.250), strikeouts (49), and complete games (4) in just 8 starts as a freshman, before transferring to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. He helped the Cornhuskers reach the 2005 College World Series, and helped lead Nebraska to its first College World Series win. He had a 10‚Äì2 won/loss record with a 2.81 ERA for the year, and his 2005 stats included 5 double-digit strikeout games. Triceps tendinitis limited his 2006 season but he still pitched in 14 games, posting a 6‚Äì5 record with a 3.93 ERA and 102 strikeouts in 89.1 innings. During the 2004‚Äì2005 college off-season Chamberlain pitched for the Nebraska Bruins of the National Baseball Congress. He started six games in 2005, recording a 5‚Äì0 record and a 1.59 ERA. Professional baseball career Minor leagues Chamberlain was drafted 41st overall by the New York Yankees in the 2006 Major League Baseball draft; the Yankees received that draft pick as free agent compensation for Tom Gordon, who signed with the Philadelphia Phillies. Chamberlain did not pitch in the organized minors during the 2006 season, but pitched in the winter league in Hawaii, posting a 2.63 ERA for the West Oahu CaneFires. Before the 2007 season, Baseball America ranked Chamberlain as the 4th-best prospect in the pitching-rich Yankee organization, and the 75th-best prospect in Major League Baseball, and ranked his fastball as the best in the Yankee farm system. He spent the first part of his 2007 season on the Single-A Advanced Tampa Yankees in the Florida State League. He went 4‚Äì0 with a 2.03 ERA in 7 games, and had 51 strikeouts and 11 walks. He was then promoted to the Double-A Trenton Thunder in the Eastern League, where he was 4‚Äì2 in 7 games with a 3.43 ERA and 64 strikeouts. He was named to the U.S. Team in the 2007 All-Star Futures Game July 8 at AT&T; Park. Chamberlain pitched the third inning, striking out one, walking one, and allowing a hit and an earned run. On July 24, 2007, Chamberlain was promoted to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, and made his first start the next day, striking out 10 in 5 innings and earning his first Triple-A victory. While the Yankees still saw him as a starter in the future, the team announced on July 29, 2007, that Chamberlain would be moved to the Scranton-Wilkes Barre bullpen, and he made his first appearance the next day, striking out the side in 1 inning pitched and hitting 100 on the radar gun three times. On August 1, Joba went back to Trenton to make a relief appearance, striking out 2 batters in a 1‚Äì2‚Äì3 8th inning. He then came back to Scranton, pitching 2 innings and striking out 5 batters. New York Yankees 2007‚Äì2009 On August 7, 2007, the Yankees purchased Chamberlain's contract, elevating him to the major leagues for the first time in his career. In his debut, a Yankees victory over the Toronto Blue Jays, Chamberlain struck out the first batter he faced and went on to pitch two scoreless innings, striking out two. Chamberlain's usage in games was initially restricted by what were referred to as the \\"Joba Rules\\", which prevented him from pitching on consecutive days and gave him an additional day of rest for each inning pitched in an outing. On August 30, 2007, during a game against the Boston Red Sox, Chamberlain threw two pitches over the head of Kevin Youkilis. Chamberlain was subsequently ejected for the first time in his Major League career. The next day, Chamberlain was sentenced to a two-game suspension and a $1,000 fine.Chamberlain Draws Boston's Attention In Game 2 of the 2007 ALDS against the Cleveland Indians, Chamberlain was pitching in the bottom of the eighth with the Yankees leading 1‚Äì0. Suddenly, a host of small midges swarmed the field. He was repeatedly sprayed down with insect repellent, which had no apparent deterrent effect on the midges. Chamberlain threw 2 wild pitches, yielding the tying run. The Indians went on to win the game 2‚Äì1. The Yankees would then lose the Division Series against the Indians in 4 games in the best-of-five series. Chamberlain during 2008 spring training On March 20, 2008, the Yankees announced that Chamberlain would start the season in the bullpen. Manager Joe Girardi stated that Chamberlain would be used 'without restrictions' but that the team's use of Chamberlain would be guided by common sense. Chamberlain pitching for the Yankees in 2008 Chamberlain was granted a leave of absence on April 13, 2008, when he received news that his father, Harlan, was in the hospital after collapsing at his home in Lincoln, Nebraska. At the time of his leave, Joba had a record of 1‚Äì0, with a 0.00 ERA, six strikeouts, and 3 holds in 4 games and 5 innings pitched. Chamberlain returned from the bereavement in time for the 2nd game against the Baltimore Orioles on April 19, 2008. On April 20, Hank Steinbrenner announced that he wanted Chamberlain to be moved into the rotation. In May, Girardi announced Chamberlain was being transitioned into the starting rotation. On June 3, Chamberlain made his first MLB start against Roy Halladay and the Toronto Blue Jays lasting only 2 innings while allowing 2 runs, a hit and 4 walks. On June 25, Chamberlain earned his first career win as a starter, throwing 6 scoreless innings against the Pittsburgh Pirates, en route to a 10‚Äì0 Yankees victory. On July 25, Chamberlain threw 7 shutout innings against the Red Sox, outdueling Red Sox ace Josh Beckett, allowing only 3 hits and striking out 9. The Yankees won the game 1‚Äì0. On August 4, Chamberlain injured his shoulder in a game against the Texas Rangers and was placed on the 15-day disabled list with rotator cuff tendinitis. Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman later acknowledged that this injury had a lasting effect. Chamberlain ended the season with a 3‚Äì1 record and eight no-decisions.Chuck, Bill. 100 random things about the Red Sox, Rays, and Yankees, The Boston Globe. Published April 2, 2009. Retrieved May 2, 2009. 2009‚Äì2013 Chamberlain during the 2009 ALCS Chamberlain learned about his role in the Yankees rotation in November, and stated that knowing about the team's plans to use him as a starter rather than as a reliever who would move into a starting role at some point in the middle of the season (as was the case in 2008) changes his mental approach to preparing for the season, and makes things easier on him. During the All-Star break, Chamberlain went back home to Lincoln, Nebraska to get his mind off things by playing with his son so he could \\"be himself\\" and get more confidence on the mound. Chamberlain continued to struggle in the second half of the season. The Yankees considered demoting him to the minor leagues and leaving him off of the postseason roster, but the Yankees kept Chamberlain on the roster in a set-up role as the Yankees went with a three-man starting rotation en route to winning the 2009 World Series. Heading into the new season, before spring training Yankees manager Joe Girardi declared that there would be competition for the fifth spot in the Yankees starting rotation. The favorites were most notably Chamberlain and Phil Hughes. Towards the end of spring training, Hughes was declared the winner, which sent Chamberlain back to the bullpen. From the start of the season through July Chamberlain struggled, with an ERA over 5. His performance improved in August and September; in Chamberlain's last 28 appearances of the 2010 regular season, his ERA was 2.38. Chamberlain pitching for the Yankees in 2011 The Yankees ruled out using Chamberlain as a starting pitcher in 2011 arguing that his pitches have greater velocity when he pitches in relief. At the beginning of the season, he was moved to the seventh-inning role to accommodate Rafael Soriano. He would later become the set-up man to Mariano Rivera briefly after Soriano went on the disabled list. Chamberlain was placed on the 15 day-disabled list on June 8 due to an elbow injury. He had Tommy John surgery performed on June 16 to repair a torn ligament in his right elbow and was knocked out for the rest of the season. Chamberlain pitching in August 2012 In January 2012, the Yankees and Chamberlain agreed on a one-year, non- guaranteed contract worth approximately $1.675 million. On March 22, 2012, Chamberlain injured his right leg while bouncing on a trampoline in a Tampa jump center; he suffered an open dislocation of his ankle. Initial reports indicated that he had lost so much blood that onlookers at the scene feared that he might bleed to death. Chamberlain, however, later discredited these accusations during a press conference stating that he never suffered any life- threatening injury nor did he lose much blood. Chamberlain began the 2012 season on the 60-day disabled list due to the ankle injury, and he was recovering from the Tommy John surgery he had previously. He returned on August 1, 2012, against the Baltimore Orioles. In the top of the 12th inning of Game 4 of the 2012 American League Division Series, Chamberlain was struck on the elbow by a broken bat by Matt Wieters of the Orioles and left the game. Despite his injury, the Yankees won the series over Baltimore in five games, but were swept in the 2012 American League Championship Series by the Detroit Tigers. On May 2, 2013, Chamberlain was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a right oblique strain. He was activated from the DL on May 28, 2013. On September 5, 2013, Chamberlain was ejected for the second time in his major league career in a 9‚Äì8 Yankees loss against the Red Sox. With Jacoby Ellsbury on second after a stolen base and Shane Victorino at the plate with one out in the 10th inning, Victorino attempted to check his swing on a 1-2 pitch and first base umpire Joe West said Victorino did not swing, Victorino then singled in the go-ahead run on the very next pitch, Chamberlain was then ejected by West for arguing the check swing call after being removed from the game.\\"MLB Ejection 153: Joe West (3; Joba Chamberlain).\\" Close Call Sports and the Umpire Ejection Fantasy League.

Chamberlain began the year as the Tigers' set-up man. Chamberlain earned a save on April 22, 2014, in an 8‚Äì6 win over the Chicago White Sox, which was only the 6th of his career. Chamberlain was given the save opportunity after Phil Coke was handed an 8‚Äì3 lead and surrendered three runs, while closer Joe Nathan was given rest due to recent struggles.

Goldberg's family had been in the textiles business in Garwolin in Poland and, being Jewish, when the Germans invaded in World War II they were sent to a ghetto, but escaped by paying a farmer to hide them in a cowshed for a year and a half. After the war in 1948 they emigrated to Australia and set up in business in Melbourne. Goldberg found the ANZ Bank a ready lender in those days. The bank had quite deliberately cultivated Melbourne's Jewish community, believing them to be hard working and good credit risks. So with finance Goldberg got started in the 1970s doing mergers and deals in the textile business. Goldberg floated his Linter Group on the Australian Stock Exchange in March 1985, helped by a loose group of men known as the AFP boys (for their associations with the Australian Farming Property company). During the next two years Linter continually changed shape and variously owned or controlled many famous Australian brands like King Gee, Speedos, Stubbies and Pelaco. The stock market crash of 1987 hit the deal- making hard, but over the next few years in fact allowed Goldberg to take most of his empire private, funded by debt. His bankers were still quite happy on his 60th birthday in September 1989, but when rumours started doing the rounds later that year they appointed Lindsay Maxsted of KPMG to look over the books. What Maxsted found in early 1990 was an enormously complex web of inter- company relationships, and total liabilities of some $1700m, which was far more than anyone knew and which exceeded estimated assets by at least $425m. Maxsted thought Goldberg had probably been technically insolvent ever since the stock market crash of 1987. The assets in liquidation didn't realize their initial estimates and the shortfall blew out to $750m. The lenders for years had concentrated on Linter's excellent brands instead of the company's debt servicing ability. The group was probably only ever making perhaps $60m or $70m before tax, and (even with asset price inflation helping) that could never support loans of $1700m at prevailing interest rates (of up to 20%). Credit rating services like Moody's had Linter at junk bond status as early as 1988, but even that hadn't mattered. Goldberg had made various personal guarantees for the group and was consequently bankrupted, but not before he'd fled to Europe, where he settled back in his native Poland in 1992. Poland had no extradition treaty with Australia at that time so warrants issued in Australia for his arrest could not be executed. The Bulletin magazine found him in Warsaw in 2005, apparently back in business as a property tycoon, and with little inclination to return to Australia. Goldberg died in July 2016 of natural causes in Poland.Missing magnate surfaces as a Polish property tycoon, Sydney Morning Herald, 9 November 2005The one that got away http://www.polin.pl/en/news/2016/07/26/farewell-to-aleksander-goldberg  References  * Trevor Sykes, The Bold Riders, second edition, 1996, .

ASCII Media Works has published 22 novels since February 2006 under their Dengeki Bunko imprint. ASCII Media Works reported that as of October 2008, over 2.2 million copies of the first nine novels have been sold in Japan. The series has been called a \\"unique fantasy\\" by Mainichi Shimbun due to the plot focusing on economics, trade, and peddling rather than the typical staples of fantasy such as swords and magic. Yen Press licensed the light novels and is releasing them in English in North America. ASCII Media Works has published three volumes of a spin-off light novel series titled Wolf and Parchment since September 2016. A manga adaptation illustrated by Keito Koume began serialization in the November 2007 issue of ASCII Media Works' seinen manga magazine Dengeki Maoh. The manga was licensed by Yen Press, which has begun releasing the volumes in English. A 12-episode anime adaptation aired between January and March 2008, plus a single original video animation (OVA) episode released in May 2008. A second OVA was released in April 2009 as a prequel to the second anime season Spice and Wolf II, which aired 12 episodes between July and September 2009. Both anime seasons were released in English by Kadokawa Pictures USA and Funimation. Two visual novels based on the series for the Nintendo DS were released by ASCII Media Works in June 2008 and September 2009. Plot Spice and Wolf's story revolves around Kraft Lawrence, a 25-year-old traveling merchant who peddles various goods from town to town to make a living in a stylized, fictional world, with a historical setting with European influences. His main goal in life is to gather enough money to start his own shop, and he already has been traveling for seven years while gaining experience in the trade. One night when stopped at the town of Pasloe, he finds in his wagon a wolf-deity named Holo who is over 600 years old. She takes the form of a 15-year-old girl, except for a wolf's tail and ears. She introduces herself as the town's goddess of harvest, who has kept it blessed with good harvests of wheat for many years. Holo has experienced increasing isolation and disillusionment at the townpeople's move away from her protection towards their own methods of increasing the harvest. She is especially hurt at their forgetting of the promise made between her and a farmer when she arrived in the village and their criticism of her as a \\"fickle god\\" for needing to replenish the soil with smaller harvests. Because of these changes, she wants to go back to her homeland in the north called Yoitsu; she believes the people have already forsaken her and that she has kept her promise to maintain the good harvests. Holo also wants to travel to see how the world has changed while she has remained in one place for many years. She manages to bargain her way out of the village by making a deal with Lawrence to take her with him. As they travel, her wisdom helps increase his profits, but at the same time, her true nature draws unwanted attention from the Church. Characters ; : :Kraft Lawrence, who chiefly goes by 'Lawrence', is a 25-year-old traveling merchant who goes from town to town buying and selling various things in order to make a living. When he was twelve, he became an apprentice to a merchant relative, and set out on his own at eighteen. His goal in life is to gather enough money to start his own shop, and he has already been traveling for seven years while gaining experience in the trade. He meets Holo one night and eventually agrees to her traveling with him. She helps him by providing her wisdom which helps to increase his profits and get him out of jams. As the series progresses, both Lawrence and Holo demonstrate a growing affection toward each other. Although Lawrence rarely shows different facial expressions, he truly cares for Holo. He shows his affection through his actions, such as when Holo gets captured by the Church and Lawrence completely panics. ; : :Holo is a wolf harvest deity originally from a place in the north known as Yoitsu, which draws parallels to the legendary land of Hyperborea. She made a promise with inhabitants from a town called Pasloe that she would ensure the town would have good wheat harvests year after year. However, as time went on, the townspeople slowly started to forsake Holo, regarding her as unnecessary, and resented the occasional bad harvests that Holo told Lawrence were necessary to rest the land. As such, Holo escapes from town in Lawrence's wagon and started traveling with him to see how much the world has changed since she has been in Pasloe. Holo has chosen the form of a 15-year old girl, though she still retains her large white-tipped wolf tail, ears, and two sharp fangs. At times she can produce an ear-shattering howl. Her true form is that of a very large wolf which many people feared. In the anime she as a wolf looks to be about 30 feet high from the ground to her shoulders in episode 1, and about 10 feet high in the sewer in episode 6. In the novels she is large enough to carry Lawrence like a horse, and she can easily leap the walls of Ruvinheigen, but is small enough to fit in Hans Remelio's office with Remelio and Lawrence. In human form, she has a peculiar way of speaking, modeled after that of the oiran high-class courtesans. She is able to speak to humans as a wolf. Holo is fond of delicious food and alcohol, but she always loves something new in each novel. In volume 1 it is apples. In volume 2 it is apples preserved in honey. In volume 3 it is eel (i.e. lamprey). She takes pride in her tail and takes special care of it, constantly combing and maintaining it. In the novel, volume 1, page 65, it is described as hanging past the back of her knees. In the anime it is longer and reaches nearly to her ankles. :Holo refers to herself as . She is typically very haughty and self-sufficient, though due to her isolation for hundreds of years in Pasloe, she gradually feels very lonely, and sometimes shows a more fragile side of herself. She relies on Lawrence for company as she fears loneliness, which is something that Lawrence is very aware of and tries to comfort her in his own way. Holo is also very aware of the different time spans that she and Lawrence have, as a human lifespan is like a blink of an eye for her kind. Holo is quite scared of that fact, but hides it with jokes. Although she jokes about her affections for Lawrence at first, she slowly but surely falls in love with him. At the end of the series, Holo settles down with Lawrence and they have a daughter, Myuri, who inherits her mother's traits and is the main character of the sequel light novel Wolf and Parchment. ; :Yarei is a light novel and manga-only character. He is a farmer of Pasloe and has a long history of facilitating deals with Lawrence. On the day Lawrence passes through Pasloe Yarei \\"catches the wolf\\" in the town's yearly harvest festival. Instead Holo escapes to a larger sheaf of wheat in Lawrence's wagon. When they meet again in Pazzio, Yarei certainly knows of the existence of Holo. He subsequently avows his faith in modern methods and seeks to turn her over to the Church for burning. ; : :Chloe is an anime-original character. She is a villager of Pasloe and has known Lawrence for a long time. In fact, Lawrence taught her how to be a merchant. She had a slight interest in Lawrence, but tries to push the feelings away. Despite still not knowing how she should feel about him, she respects him as her teacher and a good friend. Their friendship is later broken when Chloe allies with the Church to capture Holo and Lawrence. She substitutes for Yarei in the anime both to fill the plothole in which Holo had no knowledge of Yarei but informed Lawrence of him nonetheless, and to deepen the drama when Chloe turned on Lawrence, her former teacher and old friend. In the anime when Chloe leads the sewer attack on Lawrence and Holo, Holo has a chance to kill Chloe, but refrains from doing so. ; : :Nora makes her first appearance in volume two of the novels. She is a skilled shepherd from a church-town named Ruvinheigen. Her companion in this profession is a well-trained sheep dog named Enek (Enekk in the anime). Lawrence entrusts her with a difficult task of gold smuggling after they meet. :After the mission is accomplished, Nora gains enough funds to emancipate herself from the Church. ; : :Amarti, who like Lawrence mainly goes by his surname for business, makes his first appearance in volume three of the novels. He is a young man who works as a fish broker. He has a crush on Holo, and proposes to her. Due to Holo's good acting, he believes her to be gentle, kind and a soft spoken, polite young lady. :After listening to Holo's fake story of being Lawrence's traveling companion due to her owing him a (non-existent) huge debt, Amarti attempts to buy her liberty and win Holo over by publicly declaring a contractual deal with Lawrence in the merchant's guild. However, he loses almost everything emotionally and financially after the pyrite's price crash and Holo's dedication to stand by Lawrence. According to Marc, due to the methods in which he built his fortune, Amarti looks down on the connections and acquaintances forged by other merchants, and believes it shameful to make use of such connections to secure a deal. ; : :Dian, who first appears in volume three of the novels, is a chronicler, living in Kumersun's walled ghetto with other \\"suspect\\" persons such as alchemists. She loves to collect Pagan tales and beliefs and has written them into a set of books. Lawrence had come to her to ask for information about Holo's birthplace, Yoitsu. Since Dian sounds like a masculine name, Lawrence at first doesn't recognize her as the chronicler he seeks. Thus, she asks Lawrence to call her Dianna. According to Holo, Dian is not human, but a bird even bigger than Lawrence. She fell in love with a traveling priest and spent a few years helping him build a church, but left because he noticed that she never seemed to grow old and became suspicious. Due to her solemn and noble bearing and somewhat mature appearance, it can be logically assumed that she's possibly much older than Holo. :Her influence appears to be quite vast. As Marc states, she protects the alchemists living in the ghetto; anyone wanting to get to them has to go through her, a task implied to be incredibly difficult. As for the feathers scattered around her shop, it's not known if she transforms often, or simply has a pair of wings kept hidden by her robe, as does Holo with her ears and tail. ; : :Marc Cole is a town merchant, a wheat seller in Kumersun. He and his apprentice, Eu Landt, assist Lawrence in his contest with Amarti, and provide dialog counterpoint to Lawrence and Holo. Marc is roughly eight to ten years older than Lawrence and very proud of his little shop and his family. He strives to hold onto his good name for their sake, though he clearly goes to great lengths to help Lawrence in any way he can. He's also the first merchant in a long while that Lawrence comes to realize and accept as a true friend and not just a business associate. ; : :Cloaked and shrouded in mysteries, Eve is a merchant from the port town of Lenos. Due to events in the past, this trader is wary of just about everyone and goes about her trade dressed as a man. Although hard to approach, Eve is talkative under the right circumstances and has a keen eye for people and business alike. She is in fact a fallen noble that was once sold as a bride to another merchant after her family's fall. She slowly laundered money from him and when he died, she started her own business. She organized a secret smuggling operation with the church then left it after she felt that they don't need her cooperation anymore then made a contract with Lawrence. Her real name is Fleir von Eiterzental Mariel Boland. Media Light novels Spice and Wolf began as a light novel series written by Isuna Hasekura, with illustrations by J≈´ Ayakura. Originally, Hasekura entered the first novel in the series into ASCII Media Works' twelfth Dengeki Novel Prize in 2005 and the novel won the Silver Prize. ASCII Media Works published 17 novels between February 10, 2006 and July 10, 2011 under their Dengeki Bunko imprint. The tagline for the novels is \\"Merchant meats spicy wolf.\\", an example of Engrish. The author of the novels has commented that what \\"meats\\" in the tagline really means is kept a secret, alluding to a possible intentional misspelling of \\"meets\\".

In 2016, publication of new books in the series resumed with the release of the eighteenth volume, along with the start of a spin-off series titled Wolf and Parchment: New Theory Spice & Wolf, focusing on the characters Cole and Myuri, Lawrence and Holo's daughter.

Despite the different cover art, the illustrations within the novels remain unchanged. Yen Press later announced that future volumes of the series and reprints of the first volume would retain the original artwork while dust jackets would carry the new covers, citing that the redesigned covers were requested by retailers in order to appeal to a wider audience.

Takahashi was quoted as being a big fan of the novels. The opening theme is by Natsumi Kiyoura, and the ending theme is by Rocky Chack; both maxi singles were released on February 6, 2008. The anime's original soundtrack was released on March 12, 2008. The anime is licensed for release in English by Kadokawa Pictures USA and Funimation Entertainment, and a complete thirteen-episode DVD box set was released on December 22, 2009. The series made its North American television debut on November 16, 2010 on the Funimation Channel. A second season of the anime titled Spice and Wolf II aired twelve episodes in Japan between July 9 and September 24, 2009. Most of the staff from the first season returned, except for Toshimitsu Kobayashi replacing Kazuya Kuroda as the character designer and chief animation director, and Spice and Wolf II is animated by Brain's Base and Marvy Jack instead of Imagin. The voice actors from the first season retained their roles. Another OVA, animated by Brain's Base and Marvy Jack, was released bundled with a picture book entitled written and illustrated by the same creators of the light novels and was released by ASCII Media Works on April 30, 2009 under their Dengeki Bunko Visual Novel imprint. Funimation licensed Spice and Wolf II and released the series in English on August 30, 2011. The second season made its North American television debut on August 31, 2011 on the Funimation Channel. On September 11, 2012, Funimation released a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack of both seasons. The April 30, 2009 OVA is included on the season two disc as episode 00. Visual novels A dating and business simulation visual novel based on the series was released on June 26, 2008 under the title . The game is made by ASCII Media Works playable on the Nintendo DS. The player assumes the role of a nameless character (the titular \\"Boku\\" who closely resembles Kraft Lawrence) as he travels around with Holo for a period of one year in the game. The story differs from that of the original novels or anime and is presented as an additional Spice and Wolf world. Ami Koshimizu provides the voice of Holo in the game. The game was released on the same day in limited and regular editions; the limited edition was sold at a higher price, but comes with a life-sized poster of Holo, among other things. A second dating and business simulation visual novel was released on September 17, 2009 titled . The game was again made by ASCII Media Works and playable on the Nintendo DS. The player once again assumes the role of Kraft Lawrence. A virtual reality visual novel titled made by Spicy Tails, a d≈çjin group founded by Isuna Hasekura, was released on June 3, 2019 for Microsoft Windows supporting the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive VR headsets as well as the standalone Oculus Go headset. It was later released for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 on September 5, 2019, supporting the Nintendo Labo VR Kit and PlayStation VR respectively. A port to the Oculus Quest headset has also been announced, as well as a sequel coming at an unknown date. Reception ASCII Media Works reported that as of November 2009, over 3.5 million copies of the first twelve novels have been sold. The light novel series has ranked three times in Takarajimasha's light novel guide book Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi! published yearly: first in 2007, and fifth in both 2008 and 2009; in the 2007 issue, Holo won Best Female Character. The first manga volume of the English release in North America debuted at No. 4 on the New York Times Best Seller Manga list, while the third volume reached at No. 3. In April 2008, the maid caf√© Cafe with Cat in Akihabara, Tokyo, Japan hosted a specially themed event called Cafe with Wolf for a period of three days between April 4 and April 6. The event included three new items on the menu and tied in with the sale of the first anime DVD volume which went on sale on April 2, 2008. People who bought the DVD from the Comic Toranoana Akihabara Honten store (which is on the first floor below Cafe with Cat) and brought the receipt with them into Cafe with Wolf were entered into a lottery to win rare Spice and Wolf goods.

Typically undertaken by professional book and document conservators, this process can include preventive measures which protect against future deterioration as well as specific treatments to alleviate changes already caused by agents of deterioration. Parchment manufacturing and properties The making of parchment in the Netherlands Parchment is the skin of an animal, usually sheep, calf or goat, which has been dehaired, processed with a lime solution and stretched under tension. The dried material is a thin membrane which is most commonly used as a writing surface, but can also be used to make other items like bookbindings and drumheads. Throughout Europe, parchment was the primary writing substrate from its development in the 2nd century BCE through the Middle Ages, though it is used through the present day for various official documents. Typically parchment made from calfskin is called vellum, though the term can also be used to refer to very fine quality parchment made from the skins of other animals. For the purposes of conservation and restoration, the term parchment is used in reference to vellum objects, as the terms have been used interchangeably throughout time to refer to objects with the same conservation concerns. Parchment has unique structural qualities which differentiate it from paper-based materials. Typically, parchment is resistant to mechanical damage like tears or creasing, though it is easily susceptible to damage from mold and high temperatures. Parchment is also highly hygroscopic in nature, meaning that changes in relative humidity can cause irreversible variations to its structural makeup. These specific qualities dictate the conservation and restoration treatments required for parchment. Physical and chemical properties Most skins used for parchment are between 1 ‚Äì 3 mm in thickness before processing. Animal skin used for parchment all has the same basic structure, with slight variations due to the species, age and diet of the specific animal. Skin is composed of innumerable fibrils made up of the protein collagen, which are held in bundles that interweave in a three dimensional manner through the skin. The fibrous material is composed of many long chain molecules of collagen, which can react with certain environmental factors. One universal property of collagen is that it exhibits sudden shrinkage when heated in water, starting at 65¬∞C. Prolonged exposure to alkali, like in parchment liming process, changes the amino acids, consequently dropping shrinkage temperatures as low as 55¬∞C.  Manufacturing Once it is removed from the animal, the skin is temporarily preserved, either by drying or liberal application of salt, until it can be processed. The skin is then immersed in water for 48 hours, which cleans and rehydrates it. This step also removes the non-collagenous materials, like hyaluronic acid, dermaten sulphate and plasma proteins. The skin is then soaked in a lime or alkali solution, known as the liming process. In the 19th century, chemicals were added to speed up the liming process, which resulted in weaker parchments. These added compounds sometimes reacted to produce gypsum, giving the parchment a characteristic gray hue. The skin is then stretched in suspension on a frame, constricting it as it dries. This ensures even contraction across the entire parchment which ensures that it will remain flat when dried. After being prepared, parchment is sometimes coated so that it is more receptive to pigment and ink. Historical coatings, which include chalk, egg whites and matte paint, must be taken into consideration as a meaningful part of the preservation and conservation plan. The manufacturing process, which removes the skin's natural fats and oils, means that parchment is more reactive to moisture and relative humidity than other skin-based material. After being stretched, parchment has an inherent desire to revert to its original animal shape, especially if left unrestrained or exposed to repeated changes in relative humidity. Identification Parchment is usually positively identified by sight, sometimes with the assistance of a hand lens or microscope. Visible hair follicle pattern, veining, scars, bruises and sometimes fat deposits all help confirm the animal origin of the material. Additional light sources including ultraviolet lights, can make these properties more easily identifiable. Sometimes visual examination is not sufficient to distinguish parchment from certain types of highly calendered papers. Misidentification of these materials can lead to inappropriate preservation methods or conservation treatments. Analytical testing, which involves removing a small piece of parchment, can be done by or under the supervision of a professional conservator-restorer to ensure positive identification. One type of analytical testing involves examining the parchment specimen under a light microscope or scanning electron microscopy. A simple flame test can also be done on the parchment specimen; true parchment will emit the meaty smell of burned protein, while other look-alike materials will smell like paper or wood. Agents of deterioration *Relative humidity changes Changes in relative humidity can cause parchment to change shape, especially if movement is restrained by a frame or mount at certain parts of the object, which leads to uneven distortion. This distortion can result in cockling and destabilization of any pigments affixed to the parchment. Low humidity levels can cause parchment to desiccate. *Water and excessive moisture Direct water contact and excessive moisture in the environment can cause structural problems for parchment including: expansion of object; discoloration; alteration of surface coatings; gelatinization of skin; and realignment of fibers. *Oxygen Atmospheric oxygen reacts with the chemical composition of parchment, which subsequently changes the physical properties of the object over time. *Mold Mold is a probable consequence of water damage to parchment, especially when the object is not dried within 48 hours of the initial contact with water. *Heat: Heat in excess of the ideal storage conditions can cause damage to collagen structure, irreversible contraction and alteration of surface materials in parchment objects. *Light exposure Lower wavelength and ultraviolet light lead to degradation of the collagen structure and photodiscoloration, usually causing yellowing of parchment. Parchment exposed to UV light can also have a photochemical reaction causing it to become brittle. *Flaking and friability: Consolidation of media on parchment, such as those found in illuminated manuscripts, is compromised by the instability of the parchment substrate. Excessive flexing or chemical changes in the parchment can lead to loss of pigment and text. *Poor storage Parchment which has been adhered to a rigid mount for storage or display is unable to expand and contract, as its natural tendency. This poor storage technique can lead to tears, perforations and loss. Parchment stored in an unregulated and inconsistent environment is more susceptible to damage. Storage and Preventive Care Proper storage environments can help ward off structural, chemical and environmental changes which affects the long-term preservation of parchment. Storage factors must take into account the factors of the particular parchment object, including its condition, age, storage history and plans for use. Illuminated manuscripts and composite parchment objects, which may include seals and ribbons, may have additional storage needs. A consistent storage environment is crucial for the long-term stability of parchment, which is especially vulnerable to changes in humidity, temperature and other environmental factors. Microenvironments are less expensive ways to provide consistent storage environments for parchment if the external storage conditions are not ideal. Moisture sensitive parchments can be stored in a Plexiglas sandwich by inserting the matted parchment between two sheets of acrylic and taping off all sides. Parchment can also be stored in envelopes constructed out of polyester sheets. For the long-term preservation of organic material like parchment, the ideal temperature range is 10-15¬∞C with a relative humidity level of 30-50%. The ideal storage and display environment is oxygen-free, as oxygen prevalence has been shown to react with collagen over time, leading to increased brittleness of parchment. Oxygen-free storage and display cases are filled with inert gas as well as a chemical substance that reacts as an absorber if any stray oxygen leaks into the encasement. Ethical concerns of conservation All conservation and restoration treatments of parchment objects should follow the conduct set forth in American Institute for Conservation's Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice. The hazards of specific treatments need to be weighed against the benefits, as many traditional liquid-based conservation techniques can pose risks to parchment. Conservation treatments Removal of previous restorations Previous repairs and conservation treatments are removed if it is determined that the parchment is in good condition and that the repair is not of historic importance to the parchment. Dried out patches are removed via cleaning and humidification techniques. Parchment objects that have been attached to mounts are removed with a sharpened lifting tool and a small amount of moisture. Previous laminations, like Goldbeater's skin and Mipofolie, can sometimes be removed with solvents and mechanical techniques, though this removal technique can risk additional damage to the original parchment. Cleaning Surface cleaning of parchment has been developed after methods used for cleaning paper, with a few key differences related to the structural and chemical properties of parchment. For the most part, chemical treatments are ineffective and some, like hypochlorites and methyl bromide, can denaturalize parchment. Prior to cleaning, any flaking or vulnerable media is consolidated to ensure it does not detach from the parchment substrate. Consolidation of parchment media is undertaken by applying various dilute adhesives like isinglass, gelatin or parchment size through brush application or by the use of an ultrasonic humidification apparatus. If their presence is determined upon examination, insects and pests are eliminated and the parchment disinfected. An appropriate round of fumigation in an autoclave is used to remove pests and sterilize the object. Dry and wet cleaning techniques can both be used effectively on parchment objects. Mechanical cleaning using erasers and other abrasive tools is used to remove mildew and dirt. Surface cleaning of parchment is typically completed using white vinyl erasers (solid and grated) and confined to areas where no media is present. Water baths, which sometimes use neutral detergents or alcohol as additives, can be used to clean as well as prepare the parchment for stretching as part of the conservation process. Another wet cleaning method, which is especially useful for removing mold and mildew, uses a cotton swab covered in fluid, usually denatured alcohol, ethanol or saliva. Laser cleaning may provide a non-contact cleaning process, though conservation labs throughout Europe still mostly use traditional wet and dry cleaning methods for parchment. Humidification Humidification is a parchment conservation treatment which involves the controlled and monitored increase in relative humidity. Humidified parchments are more flexible, which will allow for corrections to distortions like cockling, puckering and changes in original size. Some methods of humidification are: humidification chambers: moisture chambers with ultrasonic humidifier, moisture chambers with steam/ultrasonic mist; and application of alcohol and water. Localized humidification is sometimes used to treat specific folds or creases in parchment objects. Flattening, tensioning and drying After humidification, drying techniques are necessary to ensure that the parchment lays flat and does not suffer additional moisture-related issues. The specific method is dependent on the condition of the object, as well as the humidification process utilized. Some of the most common methods include: *Drying and flattening under pressure, often pressed between two absorbent surfaces *Tensioning at the edges, where the parchment is constricted at the edges with weights or clips. This techniques most closely reflects parchment's original manufacturing process. *Stretch drying on Terylene *Vacuum suction table flattening Localized creases are eased with a solution of 80% to 90% isopropyl alcohol and water, which is applied to the creases directly with a cotton swab and then gently pulled flat by hand. The Alcohol-Water mixture is azeotropic, meaning both components evaporate simultaneously. The solution has a lower surface tension than just water, which causes the fibers to suffer less shrinkage. Mending and in-filling losses Sewing tears is not recommended as a conservation treatment, unless it is replacing a sewn portion original to the object. Correcting non-original splits, tears, perforations and losses in parchment requires careful consideration of its specific condition. For losses that don't require much support, transparent membranes, such as fish skin or sausage casing, are placed over the damaged area with an adhesive. Infill materials, including new parchment, reconstituted parchment and Japanese paper, are used to repair losses requiring greater structural support. All infill materials have some conservation concerns, as they will react differently to environmental factors than the original parchment. *New parchment: It is difficult to match the infill material to the original parchment type in terms of animal, thickness and appearance. Modern parchments that appear visually similar also respond differently to humidity fluctuations, causing potential problems after the conservation treatment. Parchment infills are matched by thinning them to the appropriate size and bevelling the original parchment before the repair. *Japanese paper: Paper is dissimilar to parchment in both appearance and behavior, which can pose the future issue of storing an object with composite materials. Paper infills can be toned with watercolor or acrylic paints to better match the original parchment appearance. Acrylic-toned papers are treated with various adhesives such as B-72, Aquazol, or PVA to mimic the translucency of the surrounding parchment. Varying layers of application are used to best approximate the thickness and condition of the specific original parchment. *Reconstituted parchment: Collagen fibers and dry cellulose materials are mixed together with liquid ingredients to create a pulp-like substance. This material is applied to the original parchment in a process similar to leafcasting paper. Disaster Recovery Parchment which has been accidentally exposed to excess moisture or water is extremely susceptible to mold, mechanical damage and irreversible dimensional changes. Emergencies often affect large quantities of objects, therefore the mass treatment of objects usually includes freezing or freeze-drying as the first step. As time permits, parchment object are then thawed and dried using more traditional measures. Case Studies Charters of Freedom The United States Declaration of Independence, Constitution and the Bill of Rights, collectively known as the Charters of Freedom, were housed in metal and glass encasements, filled with helium gas, from 1952 to 2001. In 1951, the National Bureau of Standards reported that an inert gas environment would be the best means of preserving the Charters of Freedom. In 1982, the National Archives and Records Administration partnered with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory on a 9-year project which determined that the encasement glass was deteriorating. Upon the issuing of this report, it was decided that new encasements and conservation treatments were needed for the long-term preservation of the Charters of Freedom. The documents were thoroughly examined for signs of deterioration and past restorations, all of which were thoroughly documented in condition reports. The first step of treatment stabilized the ink of the text using a gelatin adhesive. The dirt and grime were then cleaned from the parchments, though original intentional marks were left alone. The Constitution and the Bill of Rights were then humidified and dried under tension to flatten the parchments. The Declaration of Independence, which has been damaged by frequent handling and exposure, was not humidified because of its increased moisture sensitivity. All the parchments were then installed into new titanium and aluminum encasements, developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which are filled with inert argon gas. The current environmental conditions of the Charters of Freedom encasements is monitored by scientists and conservators for signs of possible deterioration agents. Canterbury Magna Carta In 1731, one of four surviving copies of the 1215 Magna Carta, known as the Canterbury Magna Carta, was partially damaged in a fire at its temporary storage location at Ashburnham House. Damage included shrinkage and discoloration of the parchment substrate, though the ink text was still legible. In the 1830s, British Museum staff attempted a restoration, using chemicals to treat the parchment and unintentionally rendering the text illegible. In 2014, the British Library undertook a multispectral imaging project to determine if the text on the damaged document could be recovered. Analysis under ultraviolet light allowed scientists and conservators to see text that was invisible to the naked eye. This new technology allows the document to be used for continued research purposes, despite the previous botched restoration.  References   Notes   Sources  * Quandt, Abigail B.

It carried on unexciting business for its first 90 years, before collapsing after an excursion into bad property deals in the early 1980s. The Trustees Executors and Agency Company (Canberra) Ltd ACN 8417089 was renamed on 18/4/2014 to ANZ ILP PTY LTD ACN 8417089 TEA was established by William Templeton in 1878 when he perceived a need for wealthy or moderately wealthy people to have a good executor after their death. The company's formation required a special act of parliament because such matters had previously only been handled by individuals. The company floated in 1879 with tight restrictions on the capital investments it could make and on how many shares any one person could control. Those shareholding limits had the effect of making the board and management largely self-perpetuating, since so many shareholders would have to act together to effect change. In the 1970s the labour-intensive nature of the business was putting profits under pressure and TEA came up with the idea of offering a money market deposit service for clients, on which it would make a margin. If they actively solicited funds they would have had to prepare a costly prospectus, so the service was just quietly hinted at, letting clients request it. These client deposits took off in a big way, growing to some $133m by 1982. Yet what was supposed to be money market investments was by the 1980s being invested in property construction ventures, among them for instance the prominent apartment building The Quay overlooking Sydney harbour. Much of this activity was kept off the company balance sheet, so shareholders saw profits rising (often only due to revaluations) without really knowing the basis. Complacency at board level meant the board also had little idea what management was doing. It was not until 1983 that the board had a good overview of the property ventures, at which point, depending on the basis for valuing the properties, the company was close to insolvent. The board hoped for a merger with Perpetual Trustees (which could have suited Perpetual since a trustee company failure might have resulted in new regulations on them) but in the end TEA was wound up. Its trustee operations were taken over by the ANZ Bank and very little information on the collapse was provided to shareholders, or the public, until a government inspector's report in 1990. The lengthy criminal investigation into the activities of directors and others involved in the collapse was conducted by two detectives from the Victoria Police Fraud Squad, Detective Sergeant Jim Holcombe and Senior Detective Mick Nott. Chief executive Peter Bunning had been chiefly responsible for the property strategy along with his colleague, financial advisor/accountant Leigh Jamison. Both Bunning and Jamison were jailed for falsifying TEA's accounts and for secret commissions in the course of the deals. As Trevor Sykes remarks, despite all the corporate goings-on in Australia in the 1980s, Bunning was the only person of prominence to be jailed actually within that decade itself.

It is a subsidiary of Deseret Management Corporation (DMC), a holding company owned by the Corporation of the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The company publishes the daily Salt Lake City area newspaper, Deseret News, and its weekly inserts the Church News and Mormon Times. It also publishes a semi-weekly Spanish language paper, OKespa√±ol, and the Deseret News Church Almanac. The company was incorporated in 1931 to direct the operations of the Deseret News, which until then was owned directly by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). For many years the company operated a jobs press, known as the Deseret News Press, in which they used their presses to publish content for other publishers, such as Deseret Book. History The News The Deseret News, also referred to as the News, was first published on June 15, 1850 in Salt Lake City. The paper was started under the direction of LDS Church president Brigham Young, with Willard Richards as editor and \\"Truth and Liberty\\" as its motto. The News would start out as a weekly publication, but eventually semi-weekly and daily editions were added; all three were published concurrently until the weekly was ended in 1898.Ashton 1950, pp.225-226. The semi-weekly was discontinued in 1922, and currently only the daily edition is published.Ashton (1950), pp.283-284. Since its first issue the News has always been under the ownership of the LDS Church, but often held by various church owned companies; the first of which, The Deseret News Company, was incorporated on September 3, 1880.Ashton 1950, p.183. Because of financial troubles, The Deseret News Company leased the News along with the company's jobs press (printing and bookbinding), and merchandising‚Äîon October 1, 1892‚Äîto the Cannon family. The Cannon family formed a company to be the lessee of the News and called this company the Deseret News Publishing Company. But, the Cannon family was unable to make the paper financially sound, and the lease was returned to the church owned Deseret News Company on September 7, 1898 (and the first Deseret News Publishing Company was dissolved). Soon after the LDS Church took over direct ownership of the News and dissolved The Deseret News Company.Ashton 1950, pp.207-208, p.225. Incorporation On December 29, 1931 the Deseret News Publishing Company was incorporated by the LDS Church. Its articles of incorporation, filed with the Salt Lake County Clerk, provided for 500 shares of stock, all retained by the church (with the exception of the qualifying directors' shares). This new company took over direct ownership and control of the News and its jobs press. In 1966 the company became a subsidiary of DMC.

One year later he became part of the Santos' lower division. At the age of 13 years and 11 months, Coutinho debuted as a professional player a record never broken for any other players. His professional career at Santos took place from 1958 to 1968 and in 1970, periods during which Santos won, among other titles, five Ta√ßa Brasil and seven Campeonato Paulista titles, two Copa Libertadores, and two Intercontinental Cups.

It is the last Silly Symphonies short to be released by United Artists. Synopsis Over opening narration, a Native American boy named Little Hiawatha is seen paddling his canoe down a river ‚Äî at one point backwards ‚Äî on his way to hunt game. Upon reaching land, he steps out and immediately falls down a hidden hole in the water, bringing about the laughter of the animals in the forest. Hiawatha gives chase to them ‚Äî with his pants often falling down as the cartoon's running gag. Hiawatha pursues a grasshopper, but is foiled when it spits in his face, much to the amusement of the other animals. He chases them again and manages to corner a baby rabbit on a tree stump; he finds, however, that he cannot bring himself to kill it, especially when it repeatedly gives him sad glances, and even after he arms it with a spare bow and arrow. Frustrated, he shoos it back to its family and then breaks his bow and arrow, to the animals' great delight. Shortly afterwards, Hiawatha comes across a set of bear tracks, which leads him to a face-to-face encounter with a bear cub. He chases after it, but runs into the cub's protective mother, who aggressively chases him through the forest. In gratitude for Hiawatha sparing their lives, the other animals band together to keep him out of the bear's clutches, including raccoons using a vine to trip the bear, opossums flinging Hiawatha through the air, and beavers cutting down trees in the bear's path, among other things. Finally returned safely to his canoe, Hiawatha rows off into the sunset as the animals gather together and bid him farewell. Comics The Silly Symphony Sunday comic strip featured an adaptation of Little Hiawatha for eight months, from November 10, 1940 to July 12, 1942. The character moved to comic book stories in 1943. First, he appeared as a secondary character (named \\"Little Bear\\") in a story featuring Flower in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #30 (March 1943). This was followed a year later with an 8-page story headlined by Little Minnehaha (Hiawatha's best friend) in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #43 (April 1944). Two more \\"Little Minnehaha\\" stories were printed in 1944, followed by appearances in the Vacation Parade specials in 1950 and 1951. Little Hiawatha returned as a regular feature in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories starting with issue #143 (August 1952), and by the end of the year, he got his own one-shot comic: Four Color #439 (December 1952). Home media The short was released on the 2000 DVD release of Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World, and again in 2006 on the Walt Disney Treasures DVD box set More Silly Symphonies. It was released on Blu-ray in 2012 on Pocahontas. References External links  *Little Hiawatha [character] at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on November 10, 2015.

Moody named Burnaby Lake, in British Columbia, after Burnaby, and the city of Burnaby was subsequently named after Burnaby, as were at least ten other urban and geographical features, including a mountain, Robert Burnaby Park, a Haida Gwaii Island, and a street in Vancouver. Early life Burnaby was born in Woodthorpe, Leicestershire. Before his appointment to the staff of Richard Clement Moody, he worked for the Civil Service in London, during which service he attracted the favour of Sir Edward Bulwer- Lytton. Private Secretary to Richard Clement Moody On the strength of a recommendation by Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton, Richard Clement Moody decided to hire Burnaby as his personal secretary. In this position, Burnaby contributed to the planning of the settlement of the towns of Queensborough, Hope and Yale. Burnaby also explored the area around Burnaby Lake, which Moody decided to name after him. Within a year or so, he founded a commission trading business with his friend Edward Henderson, in Victoria. Due to high risk, speculation in a coal mine in Burrard Inlet that never materialized, and a recession, it folded in 1865. He then went into real estate and insurance. In 1862 he contended that he had a claim prior to that of the \\"Three Greenhorn Englishmen\\" to what is now known as the West End of Vancouver, but Judge Chartres Brew dismissed the documents he produced as forgeries, \\"obviously written by a liar or a knave.\\"Snyders, 49 Legislative Assembly of Vancouver Island Soon after his arrival in Victoria, Burnaby ran for the Legislative Assembly. He was elected as the member from Esquimalt and Metchosin, and served for five years. Burnaby helped found the Victoria Chamber of Commerce, and was president of the Amateur Dramatic Association of Victoria. The well- connected Burnaby was a close friend of many prominent figures in the region, including the Judges Matthew Baillie Begbie and Henry Pering Pellew Crease, gold commissioner Thomas Elwyn, and Richard Clement Moody. Freemasonry Burnaby was active in Freemasonry, and a key figure in its development in British Columbia. In 1860 Burnaby helped to found Victoria Lodge No. 1085, the first Masonic lodge in what is now British Columbia, and was elected its first Past Master.Reid When a District Grand Lodge for British Columbia was formed in 1868, under the Grand Lodge of England, Burnaby headed it as District Grand Master. At first he opposed a plan put forward by lodges affiliated with the Scottish Grand Lodge to form an independent Grand Lodge, but seeing growing tension between English and Scottish lodges, he later agreed to put the matter to a general vote. Finding wide support, he tabled the motion to create the new Grand Lodge of BC on October 21, 1871. Burnaby refused the post of Grand Master due poor health, but was elected first Past Grand Master.M.W. Grand Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons of British Columbia and Yukon, The Freemasons and the masonic family of British Columbia, (Vancouver, 1995) Settlements named after Burnaby The most lasting contribution Burnaby made to British Columbia may have been to simply lend his name to its maps. When the area around Burnaby Lake, which Richard Clement Moody had named after Burnaby, was later incorporated, in 1892, the new municipality also chose the name Burnaby. An island and a narrows in the Queen Charlottes are named for him, as well as a street, a hill, and a park in the Lower Mainland. In total, at least eleven urban and geographical features in BC bear his name. Later life Burnaby's failing health lead to his retirement in 1869 and his return to England in 1874. He died in 1878.

The Panama Sea Frontier was responsible for the defense of the Pacific and Atlantic sea approaches to the Panama Canal and for naval shore facilities in the Central America region during World War II. The Sea Frontier headquarters were located in Balboa, Panama. On the west coast of the Americas, the responsibility of the Panama Sea Frontier was to protect Allied shipping in an ocean area extending from the Mexico-Guatemala border and out around the Galapagos, then to latitude 5 degree south. On the eastern side of Panama, the sea frontier was responsible for the coastal areas from the Mexico-British Honduras boundary on the Yucat√°n Peninsula along latitude 18 degrees 5 minutes north to longitude 80 degrees 27 minutes west, and thence to Punta de Gallinas. However, the prime responsibility of this sea frontier was the protection and defense of the Panama Canal and its operating equipment. The Panama Sea Frontier also had to contend with political as well as military forces, since the president of Panama, Arnulfo Arias, had pro-German leanings, and also because neutral Panama, like neutral Spain in Europe, was a haven for Axis agents, sympathizers, and spies. Anulfo Arias was replaced as president with the pro-Allied Ricardo Adolfo de la Guardia Arango, shortly before America was attacked at Pearl Harbor. However, pro-Axis sympathy continued for the followers of Anulfo Arias, and others, and German influence continued to be very strong in the region. Commanders *Rear Admiral Frank H.

Linville Caverns are privately owned active limestone caverns located in northern McDowell County, North Carolina, just south of the village of Linville Falls, on U.S. Highway 221. The caverns are open to the public year-round for guided tours. Linville Caverns have been open for tours since the late 1930s and remain the only show caverns in North Carolina. The caverns were discovered in 1822 by local fishermen and since that time have been of interest to locals and travelers alike. Half hour guided tours escort visitors through the caverns with information about cavern history, resident creatures, and the formations viewed along the way. Formed in a deposit of Shady Dolomite at the base of Humpback Mountain, Linville Caverns offer an environment for the public to explore the subterranean world of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Visitors hear the lore surrounding the caverns, including the tale of the Civil War deserters who used the caverns as a hideout, as well as the geology of the stalactites, stalagmites, and other formations found on the tour route. In the fall and winter months, caverns visitors may be able to view the caverns' most popular residents, the tricolored bats and little brown bats. These insect-eating creatures hibernate in the caverns from late fall until early spring. White-nose syndrome, a disease caused by the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans, was discovered among the bats that roost in Linville Cavern during the winter months. While harmless to humans and domestic animals, the fungus is deadly to bats. The visitor center takes steps to mitigate the spread of the fungus by asking guests to step in a bleach solution that kills any fungus on the soles of their shoes.

History The bacterium was discovered by Peruvian microbiologist Alberto Barton in 1905, but it was not published until 1909. Barton originally identified them as endoglobular structures, which actually were the bacteria living inside red blood cells. Until 1993, the genus Bartonella contained only one species; there are now more than 23 identified species, all of them within family Bartonellaceae. Epidemiology Bartonella bacilliformis is found only in Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia and some areas of south Florida . It is endemic in some areas of Peru, with outbreaks of the disease occurring in new epidemic areas. The bacterium is transmitted by sandflies of the genus Lutzomyia. Microbiology For its isolation, special cultures are required, containing complemental soy agar, proteases, peptones, some essential amino acids, and blood. The optimum growing temperature is 19‚Äì29 ¬∞C. Colonies grow in Columbia blood agar supplemented with 10% defibrinated bovine blood incubated at 19‚Äì25 ¬∞C for 2 weeks. Pathophysiology As the sandflies bite, the bacteria are inoculated into the capillaries, where in a variable period of time (around 21 days) it invades the red blood cells producing severe intravascular hemolytic anemia (acute phase of Carrion's disease).Magui√±a C. Bartonellosis o enfermedad de Carri√≥n. Nuevos aspectos de una vieja enfermedad. AFA edit. Lima-Peru This phase is a potentially life-threatening infection, and it is associated with high fever, anemia, and transient immunosuppression. The acute phase typically lasts two to four weeks. Peripheral blood smears show anisomacrocytosis with many coccobacilli adhered to red blood cells. Thrombocytopenia is also seen and can be severe. Neurological involvement is sometimes seen (neurobartonellosis) and the prognosis in this case is poor. The most feared complications are super-infections, mainly by enterobacteria such as Salmonella, or parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii and Pneumocystis. When the bacterium invades endothelial cells, it produces the chronic manifestation of the disease known as verruga peruana. This phase consists of a benign skin eruption with raised, reddish-purple nodules (angiomatous tumours). Visualization of the bacteria is possible using silver stain (the Warthin‚ÄìStarry method) on biopsies. Disease Bartonella bacilliformis is the etiologic agent of Carrion's disease or Oroya fever (acute phase of infection), and verruga peruana or Peruvian wart (chronic phase of infection). The acute phase of the disease is a life-threatening disease characterized by massive invasion of Bartonella to human red blood cells and consequently acute hemolysis and fever. If the infection is not treated, the case fatality rate is 40 to 85% Patients in this phase of the infection can be complicated by overwhelming infections, primarily by enterobacteria (Salmonella spp) and parasites (Toxoplasma gondii, Pneumocystis jirovecii). The chronic phase is characterized by benign eruptive lesions that are pruritic and bleeding, and other symptoms like malaise and osteoarticular pain. Bartonella can be isolated from blood cultures and secretion of the lesions in people from endemic areas. Treatment Before the antibiotic era, the only treatment for the acute phase was blood transfusion, but the effectiveness of this treatment was poor and the mortality rate was high. Later, with the discovering of new antibiotics, penicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and erythromycin have been used successfully. However, because of the risk of overwhelming infections by enterobacteria, quinolones are preferred. Therapeutic failures and persistent bacteremia have been reported with chloramphenicol, and successful treatment with this drug does not appear to eliminate the patient's risk for development of the eruptive phase. So, the drug of choice is ciprofloxacin. In the chronic phase, the treatment used traditionally has been streptomycin for 10 days. Since 1975, rifampin has become the drug of choice for verruga peruana. However, failures of rifampin treatment have also been reported and resistance can develop. Recently macrolides have been used with similar effectiveness.

Daniel Roche (born 1935) is a French social and cultural historian, widely recognized as one of the foremost experts of his generation on the cultural history of France during the later years of the Ancien R√©gime. Historiography Roche has produced over two hundred publications covering a broad variety of subjects within the social and cultural history of France and Europe under the Old Regime. Roche‚Äôs research has had a significant impact on the historical study of the Enlightenment and 18th-century France in general. He has made significant use of hitherto ignored notarial archive sources such as post-mortem inventories, which have yielded insight into the basic material culture of Paris and the rise of consumerism during the 18th century. Roche has largely defined the study of ‚Äòeveryday items‚Äô (les choses banales).Robert Darnton, ‚ÄúIl Faut Savoir Compter,‚Äù French Historical Studies, 27 no. 4 (Fall 2004), 729. The social changes that took place over the course of the Enlightenment in France have figured prominently in Roche‚Äôs research. The broad scope of Roche‚Äôs research into the Enlightenment has included diverse areas such as public institutions and clothing worn by the popular classes. Notable works Le Si√®cle des Lumi√®res en Province Roche‚Äôs doctoral thesis was published in 1978 under the title Le Si√®cle des Lumi√®res en Province: Acad√©mies et Acad√©miciens Provinciaux, 1680‚Äì1789 (The Enlightenment in the Provinces: Provincial Academies and Academics, 1680‚Äì1789) and was quickly met with praise not only as a work of social cultural history, but also for its value as a study of the history of science.See Isabel F. Knight, review of Le Si√®cle des Lumi√®res en Province: Academies et Academiciens Provinciaux 1680-1789 by Daniel Roche, The American Historical Review 84 no. 3 (June 1979), 766; Roger Hahn, review of Le Si√®cle des Lumi√®res en Province: Academies et Academiciens Provinciaux 1680-1789 by Daniel Roche, Isis 71 no. 2 (June 1980), 301. In Le Si√®cle des Lumi√®res en Province, Roche conducts an in- depth examination of academic institutions outside of Paris from the late 17th century up to the onset of the French revolution. Roche argues that the provincial academies (under the patronage of the French monarchy) both protected and weakened the French state, demonstrating that the relationship between the Ancien R√©gime and the Enlightenment that took place over the course of the 18th century was complex as opposed to strictly oppositional.Daniel Roche, Le Si√®cle des Lumi√®res en Province: Academies et Academiciens Provinciaux 1680-1789 (Paris: Mouton, 1978). Le Si√®cle des Lumi√®res en Province remains a highly influential work in the historiography of 18th-century intellectual trends. The French Enlightenment is shown to be complicated where the relationship between state and academy is concerned. The historian Isabel Knight notes that the academic movement that Roche details ‚Äúboth displayed and mediated the tension between established and emerging classes, between tradition and innovation, and between ideology and criticism.‚ÄùKnight, 766. Le Peuple de Paris Le Peuple de Paris. Essai sur la Culture Populaire au XVIIIe Si√®cle (The People of Paris. Essay on Popular Culture in the Eighteenth Century) was published in 1981. It is a study of the everyday lives of the more ordinary people living in Paris during the Enlightenment who, despite living in poor conditions, underwent a degree of improvement over the course of the century in terms of material culture and consumption.Daniel Roche, Le Peuple de Paris. Essai sur la Culture Populaire au XVIIIe Si√®cle (Paris: Aubier, 1981). In Le Peuple de Paris, Roche presents an innovation in terms of source material by making extensive use of inventories (lists of belongings drawn upon a person‚Äôs death) to provide an accurate depiction of the state of material culture. The historian David Garrioch, a historian of revolutionary Paris, calls Le Peuple de Paris ‚Äúan important book not only for the new information and insights if gave, but also for its innovative methodology and the new questions it posed.‚ÄùDavid Garrioch, ‚ÄúDaniel Roche and the History of Paris,‚Äù French Historical Studies 27 no. 4 (Fall 2004), 736. La Culture des Apparences Roche‚Äôs La Culture des Apparences. Une Histoire du V√™tement, XVII-XVIIIe Si√®cle (The Culture of Clothing. Dress and Fashion in the Ancien R√©gime) details the history of clothes in Paris during the Enlightenment. Roche‚Äôs main argument is that the culture around clothing in a social context underwent a profound transformation from the reign of Louis XIV to that of Louis XVI. A study of over a thousand post-mortem inventories demonstrates that clothing became purchased in greater amounts at greater prices and with more emphasis on style than on functionality. More specifically, Roche argues that the reinforcement of social status through appearance so prevalent during the reign of Louis XIV gradually eroded during the 18th century, eventually yielding a culture of clothing that was profoundly consumer-driven and oriented around style rather than social status.Daniel Roche, The Culture of Clothing. Dress and Fashion in the Ancien R√©gime, translated by Jean Birrell (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994). La Culture des Apparences has been praised for its inherent value as a study of clothing in history, as well as for building upon the innovative use of inventories as sources first seen in Le Peuple de Paris.John Styles, a review of The Culture of Clothing: Dress and Fashion in the ‚ÄúAncien R√©gime‚Äù by Daniel Roche, The Economic History Review, New Ser., 49 no. 2 (May 1996) 408; Jennifer M. Jones, a review of The Culture of Clothing: Dress and Fashion in the ‚ÄúAncien R√©gime‚Äù by Daniel Roche, The William and Mary Quarterly, 3rd Ser., 53 no.1 (January 1996), 188. Moreover, La Culture des Apparences is of immediate significance to the modern day, as it traces the birth of the present-day consumerist and style-oriented culture of clothing. La France des Lumi√®res La France des Lumi√®res (France in the Enlightenment) is a broad examination of the social and cultural history of the Enlightenment in France. In it, Roche explores of the social and cultural changes that took place across the entire scope of French society during the 18th century, as well as the forces that aided such changes.Daniel Roche, France in the Enlightenment, translated by Arthur Goldhammer (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1998). Roche argues that the cultural history 18th century as a complex period of progress divided between ‚Äúthose who favored a broadening of cultural opportunities...and those who favored limiting such opportunities.‚ÄùRoche 1998 p 424 Also central to the La France des Lumi√®res is the establishment of certain preconditions for the progressive social transformation that took place during the Enlightenment, specifically that criticisms of all aspects of human behavior arose, the symbols of monarchy were gradually eroded, and a space formed for political activity in spite of French society‚Äôs nature and traditions as a monarchical state.Roche 1998 p 420 Criticisms Roche‚Äôs work has given rise to a number of criticisms usually originating from historians principally interested in the French Revolution rather than the French Enlightenment. David Garrioch points out that religious history, visual sources, and any discussion of revolutionary Paris (all three being of important consequence to the history of the Enlightenment although the focus on the latter tends to teleologically frame 1789 as the terminus ad quem of the 18th century) are all largely absent from Roche‚Äôs writings.Garrioch, ‚ÄúDaniel Roche and the History of Paris,‚Äù 739. The history of consumerism in early modern France is also a problematic approach to the broader French Enlightennment because the materially poor of the cities and the bulk of the rural population lacked the means or incentive to engage in consumerism.Charlie R. Steen, a review of A History of Everyday Things: The Birth of Consumption in France, 1600-1800 by Daniel Roche, Journal of Anthropological Research 59 no. 1 (Spring, 2003), 139. However, such a criticism neglects the fact that Roche did indeed devote considerable attention to the material world of the urban poor in his classic, Le Peuple de Paris (1981). France in the Enlightenment has been met with a considerable degree of criticism. D. M. G. Sutherland, another revolutionary historian, criticizes the Roche‚Äôs overly progressive take on the Enlightenment that tends to accept the Enlightenment‚Äôs own discourse on itself, disregarding anything that preceded it as being backward.D. M. G. Sutherland, a review of France in the Enlightenment by Daniel Roche, trans. Arthur Goldhammer, Social History 25 no. 2 (May 2000) 239. On France in the Enlightenment, Sutherland says \\"Daniel Roche has written the history of France in the Enlightenment that intellectuals tried to compel us to write over two hundred and fifty years ago.\\"Sutherland p 241 The progressive tone of the France in the Enlightenment is contradicted by other research, most notably the work of Robert Darnton, whose own research into the clandestine, popular, and vulgar literary culture of France during Old Regime contrasts significantly with the conclusions of progress in education, philosophy, and culture at which Roche arrives.See Robert Darnton, The Literary Underground of the Old Regime (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1982). Such a criticism overlooks the fact that Roche did indeed devote considerable attention to the \\"two worlds of Paris\\" in the Enlightenment - that of the impoverished masses from which many of Darnton's Grub Street came - and that of the wealthy elites. Furthermore, Roche‚Äôs writing has been criticized early in his career for being difficult to translate from the original French and at times jargonistic or frustrating to read for the non-expert in the field.J. Lough, a review of Le Si√®cle des Lumi√®res en Province. Acad√©mies et Acad√©miciens Provinciaux, 1680-1789 by Daniel Roche, The English Historical Review 94 no. 373 (October 1979), 865.

The sanctuary is named after the German politician Carlos Anwandter who settled in Valdivia during the 1850s. The wetlands in the sanctuary are inhabited by many bird species including Black-necked Swans. This sanctuary provides a home for many native waterbird species to flourish, and contains roughly 119 species of birds alone.{2,5} Despite being a nature sanctuary for the country of Chile under the National Monuments Act, it wasn't internationally recognized for its cultural and natural value until the Ramsar Wetlands Convention of 1971. {1} Pollution controversy {1} The conservation effort promoted collaboration between Chile (CONAF) and Mexico (CONANP) for protecting the wetlands {3} The River Cruces and Chorocamayo Nature Sanctuary Management Plan was instated in 2016 by CONAF with financing help from the Ramsar Convention. {1} In 2004, the Valdivia Pulp Mill was opened in San Jos√© de la Mariquina located 25 km (16 mi) northeast of the preserve near the Cruces River. The emblematic Black-necked Swans started at that time to die and migrate. In 2004 ecologists and people from the university UACH in Valdivia accused the forestry enterprise CELCO of polluting the river. Swan autopsies revealed that their deaths were due to high levels of iron and dangerous metals in the water. The pulp mill was forced to close while the case was investigated. [1] Even in 2006, the Latin American water tribunal recommended closing down the mill [2][3]. As of November 2008, the case against CELCO was still being debated in court.

It is based on the novel The Grand Duke and Mr. Pimm by Lindsay Hardy. Plot Etienne Pimm (Charles Boyer) has an unusual way of making a living: he arranges for impoverished European aristocrats to marry unsuspecting rich people. He is then discreetly compensated for his matchmaking. His latest target is Millicent \\"Milly\\" Mehaffey (Hope Lange), newly arrived on the Riviera. Pimm and his assistant Janine (Ulla Jacobsson) begin grooming the penniless Grand Duke Gaspard Ducluzeau (Ricardo Montalban) for Milly by hiring three men. Julian Soames (John Wood) is to teach him manners and English. As their target fancies herself a race car driver, Pimm recruits John Lathrop Davis (Glenn Ford), a (retired) champion many times over, to instruct Gaspard in the finer points of competitive driving. The third man is world-renowned chef Maurice Zoltan (Andr√© Luguet). Pimm \\"accidentally\\" meets Milly's uncle and guardian, Dr. Christian Gump (Telly Savalas, cast against type as a cultured gourmet) and invites him to a dinner prepared by Zoltan. Gump cannot resist the bait of a meal prepared by a famous chef. After dinner, he is introduced to the handsome young duke, well prepared after weeks of intensive training. As Pimm had hoped, Gump begs him to bring the duke to a party he has arranged for Milly, confiding that he hopes they fall in love and that his troublesome ward will settle down. Meanwhile, Priory (Laurence Hardy), another of Pimm's minions, has gotten himself hired as the chauffeur to spy on the family. When an errant polo ball struck by Gaspard breaks Priory's arm, a reluctant Davis takes his place. Davis is openly contemptuous of Milly's unrealistic plan to compete in the International Grand Prix, causing clashes with his spoiled employer. As they spend more time together though, her initial dislike turns into love. With the romance between Milly and Gaspard not proceeding very well, Pimm suggests to Milly that the young couple spend a romantic night together at his private villa. She takes him up on his offer, only with Davis, not Gaspard. The next morning, Milly learns the truth and is at first outraged, even though Pimm confesses that Davis was not the intended groom. For revenge, she decides to marry an oafish suitor named Freddie (Jean Par√©d√®s). However, on her wedding day, her wise grandmother (Ruth McDevitt) convinces her to reconcile with Davis. This is just fine with Gaspard, as he has fallen for Janine.

Poll of Gold Medal Enterprises; Poll owned Gold Medal Studios in the Bronx, facilities which were hired out to movie makers. He had decided to move into film production. The screenplay was originally written by the author of the novel. Blake Edwards was originally attached to direct. Glenn Ford and Hope Lange were signed to star early on. Eventually David Swift came in to write and direct. Ulla Jacobsson signed to make her American debut with the film. The film was shot on the French Riviera. Glenn Ford and Hope Lange were a real-life couple at the time. The film had its world premiere at Las Vegas. Reception Bosley Crowther, critic for The New York Times, panned it, writing that \\"If 'Love Is a Ball,' somebody fumbled.\\" He found it \\"predictable nearly every step of the way\\" and \\"laboriously arch in tone, broadly played in general and directed with slapdash aimlessness by Mr. Swift.\\" He noted that the \\"sun-kissed scenery, though, should set anyone drooling\\".

Retrieved June 14, 2013. Setting Approximately six million years in the future, humanity has spread throughout the Milky Way galaxy, which appears devoid of any other organic sentient life. The galaxy is populated by numerous civilizations of humans and posthumans of widely varying levels of development. A civilization of sentient robots known as the Machine People coexists peacefully with humanity. Technologies of the era include anti-gravity, inertial damping, force fields, stellar engineering, and stasis fields. Also of note is the \\"Absence\\"‚Äîthe mysterious disappearance of the Andromeda Galaxy. Large-scale human civilizations almost invariably seem to collapse and disappear within a few millennia (a phenomenon referred to as \\"turnover\\"), the limits of sub- lightspeed travel making it too difficult to hold interstellar empires together. Consequently, the most powerful entities in the galaxy are the \\"Lines\\"‚Äîfamilial organisations made of cloned \\"shatterlings\\". The Lines do not inhabit planets, but instead travel through space, holding reunions after they've performed a \\"circuit\\" of the galaxy; something that takes about 200,000 years. House of Suns concerns the Gentian Line, also known as the House of Flowers, composed of Abigail Gentian and her 999 clones (or \\"shatterlings\\"), male and female: exactly which of the 1,000 shatterlings is the original Abigail Gentian is unknown. The clones and Abigail travel the Milky Way Galaxy, helping young civilizations, collecting knowledge, and experiencing what the universe has to offer. Members of the Gentian Line are named after flowering plants. Synopsis The novel is divided into eight parts, with the first chapter of each part taking the form of a narrative flashback to Abigail Gentian‚Äôs early life (six million years earlier, in the 31st century), before the cloning and the creation of the Gentian Line. Each subsequent chapter is narrated from the first-person perspective of two shatterlings named Campion and Purslane, alternating between them each chapter. Campion and Purslane are in a relationship, which is frowned upon, even punishable, by the Line. The primary storyline begins as Campion and Purslane are roughly fifty years late to the 32nd Gentian reunion. They take a detour to contact a posthuman known as ‚ÄòAteshga‚Äô in hopes of getting a replacement ship for Campion because his is getting old (several million years old). After being tricked by Ateshga, Campion and Purslane manage to turn the tables on him and leave his planet with a being he had been keeping captive, a golden robot called Hesperus. Hesperus is a member of the \\"Machine People\\", an advanced civilization of robots, and supposedly the only non-human sentient society in existence. The two shatterlings hope that the rescue of Hesperus will let them off the hook for their lateness, as returning him to his people (who will be at the reunion as guests of other shatterlings) will put the Gentian Line on good terms with the Machine People. However, before reaching the reunion world, Campion and Purslane encounter an emergency distress signal from Fescue, another Gentian shatterling. There was a vicious attack on the reunion world; an ambush in which the majority of the Gentian Line was wiped out. The identity of the responsible party is unknown, but the attackers used the supposedly long-vanished 'Homunculus' weapons ‚Äì monstrous spacetime- bending weapons that were created ages ago, but were ordered to be destroyed by another Line. Despite Fescue's warning, Campion and Purslane approach the reunion system to look for survivors. They manage to find the remains of a ship with several Gentian members still alive, and rescue them and the four enemy prisoners they had captured. Hesperus, however, is gravely injured in the process by remaining ambushers. The group escapes and make their way to the Gentian backup meeting planet, Neume, in the hope of re-grouping with any other Gentians who may have survived the ambush. Upon reaching Neume, Campion, Purslane and the other shatterlings they rescued are greeted by the few Gentian survivors of the ambush (numbering only in the forties, compared to the hundreds that existed prior to the ambush). They also meet two members of the Machine People: Cadence and Cascade, guests of another shatterling. During the next few days, the interrogation of the prisoners commences. Another Gentian, Cyphel, is mysteriously murdered, which fuels the Line‚Äôs concerns that there is a traitor amongst them. As a way of punishing Campion for transgressions against the Line, Purslane is made to give up her ship, the Silver Wings of Morning (one of the fastest and most powerful in the Line) to Cadence and Cascade, ostensibly so they can return to the Machine People with news of the ambush, in a bid to gain the Line some assistance. Hesperus, still critically wounded following the rescue of the survivors, is taken to the Neumean \\"Spirit of the Air\\", an ancient posthuman machine-intelligence, in the hopes that it will fix him. The Spirit takes Hesperus away and returns him some time later, though apparently still not functioning. The robots Cadence and Cascade make preparations to leave on Purslane's ship. They agree to take him aboard and return him to their people, who they promise may be able to help Hesperus. Purslane accompanies them to her ship, where she must be physically present to give the ship order to transfer control over to the robots. On their way to the bridge, Hesperus suddenly springs to life, grabbing Purslane and hiding her while Cadence and Cascade are whisked along to the bridge. Hersperus quickly explains that Cadence and Cascade are actually planning on hijacking the ship. Bewildered by this sudden change of events, Purslane delays in taking action, not sure if she should trust Hesperus, before deciding to ask the ship to detain and eject the robots in the bridge. By then, though, it is too late. Cadence and Cascade hack into the ship's computer, taking it over, and take off from Neume with Hesperus and Purslane still aboard. Campion and several other shatterlings immediately launch a pursuit. Together Hesperus and Purslane find a hideout in a smaller ship in the hold of the Silver Wings of Morning. Using information gained from the other two robots and his own memories, Hesperus (who is now an amalgamation of both Hesperus and the Spirit of the Air) has pieced together what is going on: Cadence and Cascade have discovered that the Line was involved in the accidental extermination of a forgotten earlier race of machine people, dubbed the \\"First Machines\\". The Commonality (a confederation of the various Lines), horrified and ashamed of this pointless genocide, erased all knowledge of the event from historical records and their own memories. Unfortunately, Campion, in a previous circuit, unwittingly uncovered information pertaining to the extermination. Hesperus believes that the ambush at the reunion was seeking to destroy this evidence before it could spread, carried out by a shadow Line known as the \\"House of Suns\\", tasked with maintaining the conspiracy. Cadence and Cascade, on the other hand, are racing for a wormhole which leads to the Andromeda Galaxy, to where the few survivors of the First Machines are revealed to have retreated. They plan to release the First Machines back into the Milky Way, thus effecting a revenge against the Commonality for the genocide. As Campion and the shatterlings are pursuing Purslane's hijacked ship, transmissions from Neume confirm that a shatterling within their midst, Galingale, is the traitor and a secret member of the House of Suns. The shatterlings open fire on both Galingale's and Purslane's ships, and while they manage to capture Galingale, they are unable to stop Purslane's ship. Unable to get within weapons range, Campion pursues Purslane‚Äôs ship for sixty thousand light years, during which time he and Purslane, on their separate ships, are suspended in \\"abeyance\\", a form of temporal slowdown or stasis. Despite efforts to stop the hijacked ship from reaching the concealed wormhole by local civilisations, the robot Cascade succeeds in opening the \\"stardam\\" enclosing the wormhole and travelling through it to the Andromeda Galaxy. On board Silver Wings of Morning, Hesperus reveals to Campion that while he managed to destroy Cadence before they could leave the Neume star system, Cascade survived and he and Cascade had engaged in a marathon battle, lasting the several thousand years the trip took. Campion, now the only shatterling still in pursuit, enters the wormhole after them and emerges in the Andromeda galaxy, a place apparently devoid of all sentient life. In his search for Purslane and her ship, he travels to a star encased in a huge representation of the Platonic solids, lands on a planet orbiting inside the structure and is greeted by a single, mechanical being, which announces itself to be the last of the First Machines in the Andromeda galaxy; the others having left (via wormholes) in pursuit of more advanced technology and knowledge. It states that the First Machines have no hostile intent towards the humans, despite what was done to them. Before preparing to depart Andromeda to follow its kin, the First Machine tells Campion that Purslane and Hesperus barely survived the passage into Andromeda, and Hesperus sacrificed himself to protect Purslane during their landing on the planet. Campion is then shown the sarcophagus that contains the still-living Purslane, and the First Machine offers to help him free her before departing. Reception Lisa Tuttle, reviewing for The Times, called the novel a \\"thrilling, mind-boggling adventure\\" with \\"visionary brilliance\\" and a \\"knock-your-socks-off ending\\". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club wrote that Reynolds is particularly adept at conveying the vastness of space and the \\"inky blackness of the void\\", adding that House of Suns \\"keeps up the tradition of forward thinking while improving on the genre‚Äôs traditionally flat prose and clumsily drawn women. An immensely thrilling, mind-bending piece of work, House looks to the center of all that emptiness and finds its beating heart\\". At SF Signal, one reviewer noted that a \\"sense of wonder is where this book excels\\", adding that \\"Reynolds is playing on a galactic-sized canvas and uses believable science to back up his grand ideas...[t]his yields mind-boggling time scales, where millennia pass by like days\\". George Williams, in his review for The Australian, said that \\"the concepts explored in House of Suns are so far removed from our time, and even from much of the standard fare of science fiction, that parts of the book border on fantasy. The author does carry off a story conceived on a scale rarely seen in science fiction. The weaknesses of the book relate to some of the old staples of novel writing. While the pace picks up at the end, it starts too slowly and at times the plot meanders. The novel may be filled with rich ideas, but neither of the two leads compels interest and the relationship between them is underdeveloped. It is a pity that these aspects of the book fail to achieve the same heights as the universe in which it is set\\".

He weighed 350 pounds, married a woman named Donna, and fathered several children. Trinchera was indicted in 1972 for the inquiry into the murder of Joe Gallo, but was released on $5,000 bail. After the murder of Carmine Galante in 1979, a fight for control of the family started. Joseph Massino began jockeying for power with Dominick \\"Sonny Black\\" Napolitano, another Rastelli loyalist capo. Both men were themselves threatened by another faction seeking to depose the absentee boss led by capos Alphonse \\"Sonny Red\\" Indelicato, Trinchera and Philip Giaccone.DeStefano 2007, pp. 99, 101‚Äì103 The Commission initially tried to maintain neutrality, but in 1981, Massino got word from his informants that the three capos were stocking up on automatic weapons and planning to kill the Rastelli loyalists within the Bonanno family to take complete control. Massino turned to Colombo crime family boss Carmine Persico and Gambino boss Paul Castellano for advice; they told him to act immediately. The three capos murder On May 5, 1981, Massino loyalists shot and killed Trinchera, Giaccone, and Indelicato in a Brooklyn night club. On the pretext of working out a peace agreement, Massino had invited them to meet with him at the 20/20 Night Club in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. However, Massino's real plan was to assassinate the capos. The ambush was set in the club store room, with Salvatore Vitale and three other gunmen wearing ski masks hiding in a closet. One of the gunmen was mobster Vito Rizzuto, who came from Montreal, Quebec, Canada with another Canadian mobster to help Massino.\\"Aftermath of a Hit\\" by David Amoruso Gangsters Inc. May 8, 2007 Massino told the men to avoid shooting so that bullets wouldn't spray around the room. Massino also brought drop cloths and ropes for disposing of the bodies afterwards. When the capos arrived at the 20/20, Massino and Bonanno mobster Gerlando Sciascia and Frank Lino escorted them to the store room. As the men entered the room, Sciascia brushed his hand through his hair, giving the prearranged signal. Vitale and gunmen rushed out of the closet, with Rizzuto yelling \\"it's a hold up\\". Massino immediately punched Giaccone, knocking him to the floor, and also stopping Indelicato from escaping. Giaccone got up and tried to run out of the room, but was blocked up against a wall with Trinchera. The gunmen killed Giaccone with a volley of submachine gun fire. The three capos were unarmed, as was the rule when attending a peace meeting. Lino, who had escaped, was brought instead of Indelicato's son, but was quickly won over to Massino's side.Raab, p. 615 After the killings, the Bonanno gunmen transported the three bodies to a lot in Lindenwood, Queens, in an area known as The Hole.

They are indigenous to the highlands of North Kalimantan (Krayan, Malinau, Mentarang and Long Bawan), Brunei (Temburong District), southwest of Sabah (Interior Division) and northern region of Sarawak (Limbang Division). In the Malaysian state of Sarawak, the Lun Bawang (through the term Murut) are officially recognised by the Constitution as native of Sarawak and are categorised under the Orang Ulu people; whilst in the neighbouring state of Sabah and Krayan highland in Kalimantan, they are sometimes named Lundayeh or Lun Daye. In Brunei, they are also identified by law as one of the 7 natives (indigenous people) of Brunei, through the term Murut. Nevertheless, in Sabah, Kalimantan and Brunei, the term Lun Bawang is gaining popularity as a unifying term for this ethnic across all region. There are also other alternative names such as Lun Lod, Lun Baa' and Lun Tana Luun. Lun Bawang people are traditionally agriculturalists and practise animal husbandry such as rearing poultry, pigs and buffaloes. Lun Bawangs are also known to be hunters and fisherman. Etymology Translation of the word \\"Bawang\\" as recorded by Spencer St. John in 1862. The word Lun Bawang means people of the country or native people, whilst Lun Dayeh means upriver people or people of the interior or Orang Ulu and Lun Lod means people living downriver or near the sea. Other names are derived from geographical reference to their rice cultivation, for example Lun Baa' (swamps) who lives near swampy areas and grow wet rice, and Lun Tana' Luun (on the land) who cultivates dry rice. While insisting that they never called themselves Murut, the Lun Bawangs were formerly identified as Murut by the British colonists and by outsiders (other ethnic group). In Lun Bawang language, the word Murut either means 'to massage' or 'to give dowry', and these meanings have little or no relation at all to the identity of the people. The name Murut might have been derived from the word \\"Murud\\", a mountain located near an old Lun Bawang settlement, hence might have just meant 'mountain men' or 'hill people' but was instead used by the colonist to identify this ethnic group. In addition to that, ethnologist found that the classification under the name Murut is confusing as the term is used differently in Sabah, Sarawak and Brunei, that is whilst in Brunei and Sarawak it is used to describe the Lun Bawang people, in Sabah it is used to identify an ethnic group that is linguistically and culturally different from the Lun Bawangs.Pelita Brunei - Sastera dan Budaya In the early 1970s, the use of the term Lun Bawang began to gain popularity amongst ethnologist and linguist, and it is now the most commonly used term to identify this ethnic group. In Sarawak, the decision to replace the term 'Murut' to 'Lun Bawang' to identify this ethnic group was made unanimously by Lun Bawang community leaders, and the official usage of this term is now legally binding following the passing of Interpretation Act by Sarawak's Legislative Assembly in 2002. Origin The Lun Bawangs made up of one of the ethnic natives that occupied the Borneo Island for centuries. According to Tom Harrisson (1959) and S. Runciman (1960), the Lun Bawang Community is one of the earlier settlers in the mountainous regions of central Borneo and they are related to the Kelabit tribe. Both tribe are linked to a common lineage termed the Apo Duat or \\"Apad Uat\\" people, of which Apo Duat is the area consisting of the Krayan highland and Kelabit Highlands. One theory suggests that Apo Duat is the homeland of this common ancestor, and that they have expanded out to the coastal area. The migration of these people to the low lands and gradual spreading out might have been spurred by various waves of migration of the Lun Bawang people from different clans. The migration of Lun Bawang people from one clan to a region already inhabited by another clan, causes the latter to move to another region, despite them having similar culture and language. The strong clan identity of the Lun Bawang people is shown by their common tradition of identifying themselves based on their village or geographical location, for example, 'Lun Adang' who once resides the Adang river basin or 'Lun Kemaloh' who comes from the Kemaloh river. One other theory suggests that these Apo Duat people were once natives of old Brunei, but were pushed upriver into the highlands by the invading tribes such as Kayan, Kenyah and Iban people. The ones that remained downriver (Lun Bawang people) were isolated from the ones who migrated to the highlands (Kelabit), causing their culture and language to slightly diverged. Four Lun Bawang tribesman from Sarawak, previously called Trusan Muruts, photos taken by ethnologist Charles Hose in 1896. Another theory, on the other hand, suggests that the migration originated from the opposite side of Borneo (now East Kalimantan). It was suggested that the Apo Duat people were once farmers in the lowlands downstream of Malinau river, living closely with the Tidong people. However, attacks by Muslim raiders (Bugis and Tausug) probably in the 17th century, caused them to migrate to the Krayan highlands, whilst the Tidong people converted to Islam. Nevertheless, these theories have yet to be proven and there are no substantial evidence to trace the origin of the Lun Bawang people or to prove any of these theories. History Geographical distribution of Lun Bawang speakers. Relations with the Kingdom of Brunei According to Brunei oral tradition, the Lun Bawangs (Murut) were brought under the rule of the Brunei kingdom by peaceful measures during the reign of Awang Alak Betatar. This is said to be accomplished through dealings between the Lun Bawang and Awang Alak Betatar's brother, Awang Jerambok. Under the rule of the Brunei kingdom, the Lun Bawang were subject to taxes and tribute. The local leaders from the higher class (lun mebala or lun do') were appointed titles of nobility and were granted office in the sultanate. Some Lun Bawang were assimilated into Malay culture. Lun Bawang community located near to the Brunei capital were firmly integrated to the Brunei polity. Awang Alak Betatar and his 13 brothers were the founding fathers of Brunei, and are believed to be half Muruts, as they had a common Murut father by the name of Upai Semaring or Awang Semaun. These 14 saudaras or 14 brothers are Kelabit (Murut) and their followers were early \\"empire builders\\" of Brunei. Lun Bawangs and Kelabits (Muruts) are of royal descents from the House of Bolkiah, as they use titles such as Dayang, Sultan, Agong and Pengiran, names used by their ancestors in the past. Nevertheless, the peace dealing between the Lun Bawang and the Brunei Malay rulers was by no means everlasting as throughout the history of Brunei sultanate, the Lun Bawang had often rebelled against its Brunei ruler. It has been suggested that the insurrection of the Maruts (sic) - i.e. the Lun Bawangs - and Chinese had led to the Brunei Sultan requesting assistance from the Sulu sultanate to suppress the rebellion in 1658, which resulted in the Brunei Sultan ceding his territory of Kimanis until Tapean Durian to the Sultan of Sulu as a sign of gratitude.  Lun Bawangs with Europeans settlement  Early Europeans uses the exonym Maroot, Marut, Morut or Murut to describe the Lun Bawang people, and this might have been introduced by the Brunei Malays who came in contact with them in Brunei. The earliest European written account of the Lun Bawang people is probably by Thomas Forrest during his voyage to New Guinea, the Moluccas and Balambangan in 1776. He described that the Borneans (sic - i.e. Bruneians -) tended to preclude the Chinese or European from directly dealing with the Maroot in trade, reserving the trade (as middlemen) to themselves. In John Hunt's Sketch of Borneo or Pulo Kalamantan in 1812, he described the Lun Bawangs as aborigines of Borneo proper, and that they are much fairer and better featured than the Malays, having more strong and robust frame and are credited as a brave race of people. Europeans have also obtained the description of the Lun Bawang from Brunei Malays who came in contact with them. For example, during the voyage of the American Himmaleh to Brunei, Brunei noblemen (pangeran) reported that there are 21 tribes in Brunei - Murut being one of them - and that these tribes are kafir (do not practice Islam) and practices headhunting. During Henry Keppel's expedition to Borneo, he noted that the Lun Bawang are inhabitant of Borneo interior, and that the Murut and Dyak people had given place to Kayan people whenever they are in contact with each other. Sir James Brooke in his journal written on 24 December 1850, described the oppression that the Lun Bawang (then called Limbang Muruts) people faced by Brunei aristocrats, and where some had fought against this tyranny. A more elaborate European account of the Lun Bawang people is by Spenser St. John in 1860, where he described the impoverished condition of the Lun Bawang (then called Limbang Muruts) people under the rule of the Brunei Sultanate. He also gave account of the aborigines (Murut and Bisaya) rise to insurrection, however these rebellions were always suppressed by threat by the Brunei government to bring in Kayans to subdue the opposition. Spenser St.John also described the tyranny conducted by the Brunei aristocrats upon the Limbang Muruts, which include seizing their children to be sold as slaves if taxes were not paid, and on one occasion, when the Brunei capital were in a state of alarm by the marauding Kayan warriors, the Brunei aristocrat offered a whole Limbang Murut village to be pillaged, in return for the safety of the capital.  Culture and economical activities  Lundayeh women from Sabah, Malaysia in traditional attire. Almost all of the traditional economical activities of the Lun Bawang and are related to rice plantation, and they cultivate both rice on hill called lati' tana' luun and rice from paddy field called lati' ba. The production of rice is related to ones' prestige/financial status, as excess of rice harvest are traditionally consumed in huge irau feast, signifying wealth and fortune. Cooked rice is wrapped inside banana leaves called Luba' Laya, and rice is also brewed into rice wine or burak for practical reasons. Partly due to this, drinking burak had been an important (and also notorious, as is deemed by the Christian missionaries and the Brooke government) custom of the Lun Bawangs, but now the rice wine production has significantly dwindled due to effort done by the Christian missionaries and Brooke government to encourage prohibition of alcohol amongst the community in the early 20th century. Meat and fish are brined or pickled using salt and is stored in hollow bamboo stalk for a duration of a month and the pickled food is called telu' . Meat and fish are also preserved by smoking. Salt is obtained by evaporating brine from salt spring (lubang mein). Cattle and buffaloes are bred for their meat, and can serve as a symbol of financial status. These animals are commonly used as dowry that are presented to the bride's family from the groom's side. In the old days, the men wear jackets made of tree barks called kuyu talun. Cloth wrapped around the forehead is called sigar and loin cloth is called abpar. A long machete (pelepet) is tied to the waist, especially when it needs to be carried to tribal wars. As for the women, they wear pata on their head, beret on their waist, bane around the neck and gileng or pakel is worn as ornaments on their hands and wrists. \\"Pata\\", or cap made entirely of bead, is worn as a status symbol. The Lun Bawang belong to a group termed as Nulang Arc group (Metcalf 1975). These ethnic (along with other ethnics such as the Berawans, the Melanaus and the Kajangs) traditionally practised an ancient tradition of secondary treatment of the dead. In Lun Bawang, this is called mitang butung. Metcalf theorised that this practice is a characteristic of the most ancient cultural tradition in Borneo, before the arrival of other invading ethnics that influenced the diversification of culture and language in Borneo. Language Lun Bawang among the languages of Kalimantan (code lnd, light red #30, top) The Lun Bawangs called their language Buri Lun Bawang or Buri tau, our language . Festivals and celebrations Agung. Lun Bawang people celebrate Irau Aco Lun Bawang (Lun Bawang festival) annually on the first of June in Lawas, Sarawak. This festival is traditionally a celebration of the rice harvest, but now it showcases a variety of Lun Bawang culture and events such as Ruran Ulung (beauty pageant contest) and ngiup suling (bamboo musical instrument band). In Sipitang district of Sabah, Sabahan Lun Bawangs and Lundayeh celebrates the harvest festival (Kaamatan) biennially during the Festival of GATA (Gasing and Tamu Besar), during which traditional dances and costumes are being showcased along with those of other native ethnics in the district such as the Murut, Kedayan and Brunei Malay people. Being a predominantly Christian community, Lun Bawang also since the 1950s traditionally celebrates \\"Irau Rayeh\\", which is an Easter festival and celebration. Religion Lun Bawangs were mostly animist before the 1920s. Under the rule of the White Rajahs (Vyner Brooke) in Sarawak, Christian missionaries (particularly of the Borneo Evangelical Mission) had better accessibility to the Lun Bawang settlements in the interior and highlands, and proceeded to preach Christianity to the Lun Bawang people. The majority of the Lun Bawangs are Christians, predominantly of the Borneo Evangelical Church. A small number are of other Christian denominations, such as True Jesus Church, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Roman Catholic Church, or of another religion, such as Islam and Buddhism. Standard of living Prior to the rule of the White Rajahs, the Lun Bawang tribe was in a deplorable state; frequently involved in tribal war, headhunting and excessive alcohol consumption. The Lun Bawang tribe were often a victim of political manipulation by the Sultanate of Brunei, for example they were used as sacrifice for the marauding Kayan people who threaten to attack the Brunei capital in the 1860s. The low standard of living had led to severe outbreak of diseases (cholera and smallpox) amongst the community, and the population significantly dwindled to the point of near extinction in the 1920s. With the advent of Rajah rule and conversion to Christianity, the standard of living improved tremendously, as the missionaries introduced better healthcare, sanitary system and also proper education system. The Lun Bawang were very zealous at school, and in 1940, about 95% of the Lun Bawang and related Kelabit tribe under 20s in Lawas Damit are literate. The Borneo Evangelical Mission movement has played a major role in a social and economic development of the Lun Bawang community, especially in educating the people on the importance of education and health, also in maintaining peace between Lun Bawang people and those from other ethnic living nearby. Whilst many Lun Bawangs attained higher level of education in nearby towns such as Lawas, Limbang and Miri, and in Sabah, Sipitang and Beaufort; and subsequently furthering their studies in the state capitals or in Peninsular Malaysia, there are still relatively little development of schools in Lun Bawang settlement in the interior, such as Long Pasia or Ba' Kelalan. Therefore, many Lun Bawang youth in the interior travel a distance from their home in order to pursue education, sometimes via river transport or gravel road. Job intake in some of the main industries in Sabah and Sarawak, such as oil and gas and palm oil industry remains relatively small, and some are still involved in subsistence farming and fishing. However with continued efforts, many of them managed to become professionals. A 2011 statistics has shown that there are around 233 graduates amongst the Lun Bawang community in Sarawak.http://blogtau.com/educational-statistic-of-the-lun-bawang- october-2011/ Notable people Sarawak * Henry Sum Agong from Lawas, Sarawak - The Deputy Minister of Rural Development, Former Deputy Minister of Domestic Trade, Cooperatives and Consumerism of Malaysia and incumbent Member of the Parliament of Malaysia for Lawas constituency (P222 Lawas). * Baru Bian from Lawas, Sarawak - former Minister of Works, member of the Sarawak State Assembly for Ba'kelalan (N81 Ba'kelalan) and member of the Parliament of Malaysia for Selangau consistency (P214 Selangau (federal constituency)) * Racha Umong from Lawas, former President of Borneo Evangelical Mission, member of the Sarawak State Assembly for S42 Lawas (1963-1970) and former member of Dewan Rakyat of the 4th and 5th Parliament of Malaysia, representing P154 Limbang-Lawas constituency and P154 Bukit Mas constituency respectively. * Mutang Tagal from Lawas, former member of Dewan Rakyat of the 6th and 7th Parliament of Malaysia, representing P154 Bukit Mas (federal constituency), P177 Bukit Mas (federal constituency) respectively.

The club is affiliated to Cork GAA and Carbery GAA divisional boards. The farming and fishing community of Ilen Rovers hails from the estuary of the River Ilen, the West Cork river that flows through Skibbereen before entering the sea near the fishing port of Baltimore, the gateway to the islands of Sherkin, Cape Clear and Heir. The club crest depicts this rural geographical area showing the Beacon to the south and Kilcoe castle to the west with the Ilen flowing between and the sea beyond. History The Club was founded in 1973. It comprises players from the parish of Rath and the Islands and the parish of Aughadown, the two parishes that bound the river estuary. In the club's first year, three teams were affiliated under 14, under16 & minor. Success was instant, winning the SW minor B championship, in that first year. This prompted the club to enter under 21 and junior B teams in 1974, with the under 21s losing the SW championship final. They were runners up in the same competition in 1975, before winning this championship at the third attempt in 1976. However the promising start failed to transfer itself to the junior team. In fact the club lost the first round of the junior B championship every year from 1974 - 1982. Finally their championship jinx was broken in 1983, and the team went all the way to championship success. Four fruitless years followed in junior A, before the club re-graded for the only time in their history in 1988. The Junior B championship was won again that year and history was made when the team reached its first county final, only to lose to Abbey Rovers after a replay. The early 1990s were barren years for the club, at all grades, until 1995, when the minor team won league and championship double, and followed this with Cork Minor B Football Championship honours, beating Newtownshandrum in both league and championship finals. The achievement sparked new enthusiasm within the club and in the following year, 1996, the club won its first West Cork Junior A Football championship in its first final appearance. A second junior A title was won in 1999, sparking off a remarkable period of success for the club. Three SW junior A titles were won in a row, 1999, 2000 & 2001\\\\. It was a setback to lose the Cork Junior Football Championship final in 1999 by a point to Youghal, but 2001 yielded dividends capturing the title by overcoming Kinsale. The first year up in the intermediate grade, 2002, was a successful one, winning the county league title and also the All Ireland junior 7 a-side. They returned the following year to win the Cork Intermediate Football Championship, beating Carrigaline in the final. This was followed up by winning the inaugural Munster Intermediate Club Football Championship in this grade, beating St Senan's of Limerick in the provincial decider and the first All-Ireland Intermediate Club Football Championship title by defeating St Michael's of Donegal. Since then, pride of place must go to the Under 16's who won the club's first ever SW championship at this grade in 2005, and followed it up with victories in 2006 & 2007, to complete the club's second three in a row. The under 16‚Äôs reached the county final in 2005, losing out to Valley Rovers and again in 2006, losing to Glenville in the final. The club has also introduced Hurling at underage level in recent years. Meanwhile, the club made its senior championship debut in 2004 and the appearance in a county final at the grade so soon would seem an improbable dream to the founders of the club. Since 2004 the club has been building a strong underage system in which they've won three Under 16 West Cork titles (2005,2006,2007) with 2 appearances in County Finals (2005 & 2007) losing both by narrow margins. They have also won 3 West Cork Minor B Titles 2007, 2009, 2010 and 1 Minor County B Title in 2010 defeating Naomh Aban, This was the club's 2nd ever County Title at underage level to date. Whilst in 2011 they won their first ever Western Region Minor A title, while losing narrowly lost the County Final to Kanturk in the club's first ever County A appearance. In those early years of the club, they had no proper pitch of their own and depended on local farmers to provide fields. In the late 1970s the club, in tandem with Aughadown Community Council, started to develop a playing pitch in Church Cross which was completed in 1982. More recently, a second pitch has been completed in Rath and was opened in 2005. This is hugely important for the club as the number of participating teams has risen from eight in 2004 to thirteen in 2007.

As with many other kingdoms around this period (earlier than 200 BCE), most of the information about the Early Pandyas come to modern historians mainly through literary sources and some epigraphic, archaeological and numismatic evidence. The capital of the Early Pandyan kingdom was initially Korkai, Thoothukudi and was later moved to Koodal (now Madurai) during the reign of Nedunjeliyan I. The kingdom lay to the south of the Maurya Empire of India. The kings of the Pandyan Dynasty are frequently mentioned in Sangam literature of the third century BCE and onwards, in literary works such as the Mathuraikkanci and other early Tamil literary works such as Cilapatikaram, which have been used by historians to identify their names and, to some extent, their genealogy. Nedunjeliyan II is referred to as the most popular warrior among the Early Pandyas, winning a battle at Talaialanganam against a coalition of forces from Cholas and Cheras and five other kingdoms. The early Pandyan kingdom extended between Travancore in the west, Vellaru river in the north and all the way to the ocean in the east and the south. The Early Pandyas had active maritime trade relationships with the west, a fact testified by western classical writers such as Pliny the Elder (1st century CE), Strabo, Ptolemy and the author of the Periplus. The Pandyan country was well known for pearl fishery, with Korkai being the principal center of the trade. Some of the exports were pearls, spices, ivory and shells, while the imports included horses, gold, glass and wine. Origin and Sources The origin of the word \\"Pandya\\" has been a subject of much speculation. Historians have used several sources to identify the origins of the Early Pandyan dynasty with the pre-Christian Era and also to piece together the names of the Pandyan kings. Unfortunately, the exact genealogy of these kings has not been authoritatively established yet. One theory is that the word Pandya is derived from the Tamil word \\"Pandi\\" meaning bull. Ancient Tamils, considered the bull as a sign of masculinity and valor.The primary classical language of the world By √ëƒÅnamuttanÃ≤ TƒìvanƒìyanÃ≤ Pandya became the epithet of the first Pandyan king of Thenmadurai (lit. south Mathura), Kulasekharan Pandya as he was built like a bull. It was used as an epithet of masculinity. His son, the second king of Thenmadurai, the legendary Malayadhwaja Pandya who sided with the Pandavas and took part in the Kurukshetra battle is described as follows in Karna Parva (verse 20.25):Mahabhrata Book Eight: Karna By Adam BowlesThe Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa translated into ..., Volume 8 By Kisari Mohan Ganguli Malayadhwaja Pandya and his queen Kanchanamala had one daughter Thathagai alias Meenakshi who succeeded her father and ruled the kingdom successfully. The Madurai Meenakshi Amman temple was built after her. The city of Madurai was built around this temple.Let's go: India & Nepal, 2004 By Let's Go, Inc. Yet another theory suggests that in Sangam Tamil lexicon, the word Pandya means old country in contrast with Chola meaning new country, Chera meaning hill country and Pallava meaning branch in Sanskrit. The Chera, Chola and Pandya are the traditional Tamil siblings and together with the Athiyamaan are the major Kings that ruled ancient Tamilakkam. Literary sources in Tamil Several Tamil literary works, such as Iraiyanar Akapporul, mention the legend of three separate Tamil Sangams lasting several centuries before the Christian Era and ascribe their patronage to the Pandyas. The Sangam poem Maduraikkanci by Mankudi Maruthanaar contains a full-length description of Madurai and the Pandyan country under the rule of Nedunjeliyan II. The Nedunalvadai by Nakkirar contains a description of the king's palace. The Purananuru and Agananuru collections of the third century BCE contain poems sung in praise of various Pandyan kings and also poems that were composed by the kings themselves. Kaliththokai mentions that many Dravidian tribes such as Maravar, Eyinar, Oliar, Oviar, Aruvalur and Parathavar migrated to the Pandyan kingdom and started living there in the Third Tamil Sangam period 2000 years ago. The Chinese historian Yu Huan in his 3rd century text, the Weil√ºe, mentions The Kingdom of Panyue: :\\"...The kingdom of Panyue is also called Hanyuewang. It is several thousand li to the southeast of Tianzhu (Northern India)...The inhabitants are small; they are the same height as the Chinese...\\" Draft Translation of the Weil√ºe by John Hill The Roman emperor Julian received an embassy from a Pandya about 361 CE. A Roman trading centre was located on the Pandyan coast (Alagankulam - at the mouth of the Vaigai river, southeast of Madurai). Pandyas also had trade contacts with Ptolemaic Egypt and, through Egypt, with Rome by the first century, and with China by the 3rd century. The 1st century Greek historian Nicolaus of Damascus met, at Damascus, the ambassador sent by an Indian King \\"named Pandion or, according to others, Porus\\" to Caesar Augustus around 13 CE (Strabo XV.1-4, and Strabo XV.1-73). Epigraphical sources The 2nd and 13th rock edicts of Ashoka (273 - 232 BCE) refers to the Pandyas, Cholas, Cheras and the Satyaputras. According to the edicts, these kingdoms lay outside the southern boundary of the Mauryan Empire. The Hathigumpha inscriptions of the Kalinga King Kharavela, (c. 150 BCE), refers to the arrival of a tribute of jewels and elephants from the Pandyan king. The stone inscriptions discovered at Mangulam (a.k.a. Meenakshipuram) mentions the name of Nedunj Cheliyan III and his contemporary and subordinate, Kadalan Vazhuthi. Archeological sources Excavations in Tamil Nadu in the last fifty years or so have yielded remnants of black-and- red pottery ware, normally assigned to the Tamil speaking areas around 300 BCE. Some all-black and Russet coated ware assigned to the same time period have also been found. Rouletted and Amphorae wares, made in the Roman empire and brought by traders, have been excavated in several parts of Tamil Nadu, including the Pandyan country. These imported wares are dated to the early centuries of the Christian Era. Numismatic sources The excavations at Alagankulam, near Madurai, recovered two copper coins of the early Pandyas along with Northern Black Polished Ware. These coins have been assigned a broad time period ranging from 200 BCE to 200 CE. Several coins issued by the Pandyan king Mudukudumi Peruvaludhi have been recovered in the Madurai area and have been dated to around 200 BCE. Many gold and silver coins of the Roman empire have been found around Madurai: these coins bear the names of emperors ranging from Augustus (27 BCE) to Alexander Severus (235 CE).  History  Scholars have attempted to reconstruct the political history of the ancient Pandya country based on classical works such as the Purananuru, the PattuppƒÅ·π≠·π≠u and the Padirrupattu. The first Pandyan king who has been mentioned in the Sangam works recovered so far is Nedunjeliyan I, who ruled from the coastal town of Korkai, at the mouth of river Tamraparni. During this time, the Tamil country consisted of several small kingdoms ruled over by independent chieftains, in addition to the three monarchies of Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas. In a bid to expand his territory, Nedunj Cheliyan I invaded the kingdom of Koodal (later renamed Madurai), which was under the rule of an independent chieftain, Akutai. He defeated Akutai and moved the capital of Pandyan kingdom to Madurai. This king also defeated an invading army from the Deccan Plateau and hence was called Aariyap Padaikadantha Pandyan or the king who conquered the Aryan army. He was succeeded by his son Pudappandiyan, who expanded the kingdom by conquering Ollaiyur (near modern-day Pudukkottai) ‚Äì an act that earned him the name Ollaiyur Thantha Pudappandian. Both Pudappandiyan and his predecessor, Nedunj Cheliyan I, were poets themselves who contributed to the Purananuru collection. The successor of Pudappandiyan was Nedunj Cheliyan II also known as \\"Pasumpun Pandyan.\\" Immediately after ascending the throne, he marched with his troops to the north of Vaigai and defeated the chieftain Evvi II. He then headed west and captured the Aayi territory controlled by another chieftain, Atiyan. Both Evvi II and Atiyan were made commanders of the Pandyan army for his battles against Kongu country that was further west. From here he expanded the Pandyan kingdom almost to the western coast, which earned him the title Vidambalamba Ninra Pandyan (the Pandyan whose kingdom was washed by two seas). Since he was responsible for expanding the Pandyan kingdom by annexing several kingdoms, he was also called Pannadu Thantha Pandyan (the Pandyan who annexed many lands). His successor, Mudukudumi Peruvaludhi, was also a great warrior and carried the devastation into enemy territories. He performed yagas with the aid of Brahmin priests, similar to the tradition in northern India at that time. The next king in the hierarchy was Nedunj Cheliyan III, who is considered the greatest of all the early Pandyan kings. Since the Pandyan kingdom was considerably larger than a few generations ago, he had to defend it against many neighbors invading from various fronts. Not only did he succeed in defending his territory, he also seems to have advanced into the enemy territories ‚Äì the southern province of Cholas and eastern province of the Cheras. At one point, it is said that a coalition of his neighbors including the Cheras, Cholas and five other kingdoms, met him at a pitched battle in Talaialanganam, in present-day Tanjore district. Nedunj Cheliyan emerged victorious in the battle that ensued and ended up annexing several new territories to his kingdom. He thus came to be known as Talaialanganathu Seruvendra Pandyan. The genealogy after this king is not very clear but there are at least four other kings who are thought to have ruled in the immediate succeeding generations. Notable among them were, Musiri Mutriya Cheliyan for the fact that he conquered the town of Musiri on the coast of the Arabian Sea and Ukkirap Peruvaludi for the fact that it was in his court that the famous poet Tiruvalluvar submitted his much-acclaimed work Tirukkural. Government The head of the Government was the king, a hereditary monarch. His power was restricted by the Aimberunguzhu (Tamil: ‡Æê‡ÆÆ‡Øç‡Æ™‡ØÜ‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡ØÅ‡Æ¥‡ØÅ) or the Five Great Assemblies, which consisted of the representatives of the people, priests, physicians, astrologers and the ministers. There was another assembly of officials that served the king called the Enberaayam (Tamil: ‡Æé‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æ™‡Øá‡Æ∞‡Ææ‡ÆØ‡ÆÆ‡Øç) or the Eight Groups of Attendants. While some scholars believe it consisted of attendants on the king's person like the perfumers, dressing valets, etc., others believe it consisted of more important persons like the people of the capital city, the leaders of the elephant corps and of the cavalry. The principal officers of State were the high priest, the chief astrologer, the ministers and the commanders of the army. The king divided his territory into a number of administrative units or principalities, each called a Kootram (Tamil: ‡Æï‡ØÇ‡Æ±‡Øç‡Æ±‡ÆÆ‡Øç). A Kootram was further divided into provinces called Mandalam, which in turn was divided into many sub-provinces called Nadus, with each Nadu consisting of many villages. A locality inside a town or village was called Ur and each neighborhood inside an Ur was called a Cheri. While the king ruled over his entire territory from the capital, he often placed one or more principalities (Kootram) under the near-sovereign government of some senior member of the royal family or a feudatary. The village was the most fundamental unit of administration under the Pandyas. The affairs of a village were the responsibility of its elders, who supervised the judicial, administrative and financial functions. Justice was administered free of charge, by special officers appointed as judges and magistrates, but the king was supreme and the final arbiter in all civil and criminal cases. Mortgage, lease, trust property, loans, breach of contract were some common sources of civil litigation, while criminal offences included theft, adultery, forgery and treason. The punishments were very severe and hence crimes were rare: one caught in the act of burglary, adultery or spying was given the death penalty and one giving false testimony would have his tongue cut off. The king was the chief commander of the army and usually led his army in the battlefield. The military was said to be fourfold : the infantry, the cavalry, the elephantry and the chariotry. A wide variety of war weapons filled the military arsenal including shields, swords, spears, tridents, maces, bows and arrows. The main sources of royal revenue were taxes, tributes, customs duties and tolls. Land tax, paid in money or in kind, and income tax, equal to one-sixth of an individual's income, were the major types of taxes collected. Other sources of revenue include tributes paid by feudal subordinates, war booty presents by loyal and visiting subjects, treasure troves besides land revenue, cess and forced gifts. The items incurring expenditure for the king include the military, gifts to poets and temples, maintenance of educational and health services, building infrastructure such as roads and irrigation and the palace household expenses. Society The Tamil society during the early Pandyan age had several class distinctions among the people, which were different from the Brahminical classification of Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras. Women were exposed to education, a fact testified by the presence of many women poets in the Sangam works ‚Äì some of them include Avvaiyar, Mudatamakkanniar, Kaakkaippaadiniyaar, Naachchellayaar, Naagaiyaar, Nanmullaiyaar, Ponmudiyaar, Ilaveyiniyaar and Nappasaliyaar. A variety of clothing was used by people during this age, including those made of cotton and silk. People living in hilly and deserted areas wore dresses made of foliage and flowers. Sheaths of grassy weeds (Korai) were used for making dress by the hill and forest area people. Skins of animals and barks of trees were also used. Men of the poorer classes wore only one piece of cloth around the waist. Women covered their upper body with a kind of dress called, kachchu. Among the higher classes, men wore two pieces: one around the waist and the other, the upper cloth, thrown over the shoulders. Women of sophisticated society wore half sarees, made of the finest cotton and silk fabrics, with embroidery. Both men and women sported long tresses of hair. The diet was plain, rice being the staple cereal, with millet, milk, butter and honey being in common use. Meat eating was common - people ate flesh of rams, deer, hare, fowl, porcupines, pigs and boar, fresh and dried fish. The kind of housing was determined by the type of geography of the land and the economic status of the occupants. The rich built their houses with tiled roofs and walls made of burnt bricks and mud, while the poor built their huts with mud and thatched it with grass, coconut leaves or palmyra palm leaves. Both in the huts and houses, the flooring was smeared with cowdung. The affluent had houses with porticoes, many storeys, open terraces and furnished their houses well. The inner walls of their houses were decorated with flowers and paintings, with cottages to protect them from the wind. Cots were in common use ‚Äì the rich had luxurious beds decked with swan's feathers and flowers, while the common people had beds woven with the straw of maize and the poorest people used beds made of grass or hay.

Since 2014, he has been the national political columnist for Yahoo! News. On 25 July 2019, via Twitter, Bai announced he was leaving Yahoo! News to \\"focus on screenwriting\\". For more than a decade prior to that, he was the chief political correspondent for the New York Times Magazine, where he covered three presidential campaigns, as well as a columnist for the Times. His cover stories in the magazine include the 2008 cover essay \\"Is Obama the End of Black Politics?‚Äù and a 2004 profile of John Kerry titled \\"Kerry‚Äôs Undeclared War\\". His work was honored in two editions of The Best American Political Writing. Bai is a graduate of the College of Arts and Sciences at Tufts University in Medford, MA and Columbia's Graduate School of Journalism, where the faculty awarded him the Pulitzer Traveling Fellowship. In 2014, Bai had two brief appearances as himself in the second season of TV show House of Cards.  Journalism career  He began his career as a speechwriter for the U.S. Committee for UNICEF, writing for Audrey Hepburn, among others, and his international coverage includes reporting from Liberia and Iraq. Before joining the New York Times Magazine, Bai was city desk reporter for the Boston Globe and a national correspondent for Newsweek magazine. In 2001, Bai was a fellow at the Institute of Politics at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, where he led a seminar on the next generation of political journalism. He has also been a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford and the Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago. Other work by Bai for the New York Times Magazine has included cover stories on John McCain's philosophy about war and Barack Obama's strategy to win over white men, as well as a much- discussed cover essay, \\"Is Obama the End of Black Politics?‚Äù. During the 2008 primaries, Bai wrote an online blog, The Primary Argument, on The New York Times website. He also wrote a personal essay about his Japanese American in- laws for the anthology I Married My Mother-in-Law: And Other Tales of In-Laws We Can‚Äôt Live With‚Äîand Can‚Äôt Live Without (Riverhead Books, 2006). In a 2007 interview with the Progressive Book Club, Bai said his political work is more influenced by novelists writing about urban decline in America than by other political writers. \\"I think novelists have done a better job on the whole of describing the confusing moment we‚Äôre in, in this post-industrial era\\", he said. \\"Writers like Philip Roth, Richard Russo (especially Empire Falls and Nobody‚Äôs Fool and The Risk Pool), Richard Ford (especially The Sportswriter)‚Äîthey‚Äôve really tapped into a deep confusion.\\" Books Bai's first book, The Argument, published in August 2007, is an account of the \\"new progressive movement\\" in America and the people who built it. The Argument was the only political book to be named a New York Times Notable Book for 2007. His second book, All the Truth Is Out: The Week Politics Went Tabloid, was published by Alfred A. Knopf in 2014. It revisits the 1987 media scandalization of then-candidate Gary Hart. Part history, part memoir and part cultural critique, the book was seen as a sharp critique of his own industry. Bai discussed this aspect of the book on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and on NPR's Fresh Air, among other venues. Reviewing All the Truth Is Out in The New York Times, Jack Shafer called it \\"a mini classic of political journalism\\". The New Yorker's media critic, Ken Auletta, wrote, \\"Bai‚Äôs superb book provokes many questions, and I gulped it down in a single sitting\\". Movies and television Bai co-wrote the screenplay for The Front Runner, the cinematic version of All the Truth Is Out, along with the screenwriter Jay Carson and the film's director Jason Reitman. Starring Hugh Jackman, Vera Farmiga and J. K. Simmons, The Front Runner completed filming in Georgia in November 2017 and was released in November 2018. Another screenplay written by Bai and Carson, which tells the story of a massive class action suit against Chevron in Ecuador, was honored on the Hollywood Black List in 2016. Bai has also written for television, and in 2014 he played himself in two episodes of the hit Netflix series House of Cards, as part of a season-long storyline involving a magazine story he was writing in the show.

Wallace's policy of racial segregation. Early life, education, and military service Flowers was born on November 11, 1918 (World War I Armistice Day) in Dothan in Houston County in southeastern Alabama, to a locally prominent family, the youngest of four brothers.Hayman, pp. 16-20. After graduating from Dothan High School,Hayman, p. 37. he attended Auburn University in Auburn.Hayman, pp. 40-41. Flowers entered the University of Alabama School of Law in Tuscaloosa in 1941, but interrupted his law school studies in 1942 when drafted into the United States Army.Hayman, pp. 41, 50. He graduated from Officer Candidate School in Camp Barkeley, Texas.Hayman, pp. 52-54. He was assigned to Fort Oglethorpe, then Fort McPherson, and then to Manila and Tokyo, where he was a hospital administrator assigned to General Headquarters, Far East Command during the occupation of Japan.Hayman, pp. 54-61. He was honorably discharged in 1946.Hayman, pp. 61-62. After being discharged from the military, Flowers returned to Dothan, where he worked for the Dothan Bank and Trust Company, which his family owned.Hayman, p. 64. Flowers returned to the University of Alabama School of Law.Hayman, pp. 65-67. He later co-founded Flowers Insurance Agency.Hayman, p. 118. Political career Flowers was elected to the Alabama State Senate in 1954 and became the floor leader, serving until 1962, when he was chosen as attorney general in the same election that George Wallace won the first of four non-consecutive terms as governor. As an intraparty opponent of Wallace, Flowers was invited to speak at the Yale Law School in the fall of 1965, a venue that had previously booed Wallace from that same stage. Instead of echoing the then-popular (in the North) criticisms of Wallace, Flowers began his speech with a lengthy, withering, and completely unexpected indictment of his hosts' poor manners for their refusal to have listened earlier to Wallace. In his ensuing remarks, Flowers discussed not only the importance of civil rights but the need for civil discourse and honoring the fundamental principles of the First Amendment. During his tenure as attorney general, Flowers won two landmark voting rights cases, Baker v. Carr and Reynolds v. Sims, before the United States Supreme Court. He also was instrumental in allowing women to serve on juries in Alabama. In 1966, Flowers ran in the Democratic gubernatorial primary in an effort to succeed the term- limited George Wallace. He faced former U.S. Representative Carl Elliott of Jasper, two former governors, James Folsom and John Malcolm Patterson, and Lurleen Burns Wallace, Wallace's first wife and his then-surrogate candidate. Flowers sought African American support in his campaign. Mrs. Wallace easily won the Democratic nomination and then handily defeated the conservative Republican U.S. Representative James D. Martin of Gadsden and in doing so captured a majority of the black vote.Billy Hathorn, \\"A Dozen Years in the Political Wilderness: The Alabama Republican Party, 1966-1978\\", Gulf Coast Historical Review, Vol. 9, No. 2 (Spring 1994), pp. 22, 28 Flowers prosecuted the Ku Klux Klan and fought for school desegregation. He reported that crosses were burned in his yard, and bricks were thrown through his windows. Conviction In 1968, Flowers and two others were indicted on federal charges of a conspiracy to extort payments from life insurance companies that sought licenses to conduct business in Alabama.Dennis Hevesi, Richmond Flowers Is Dead at 88; Challenged Segregation and Klan, New York Times (August 11, 2018).Phillip Rawls, Richmond Flowers; Ala. Attorney General Opposed Segregation, Associated Press (August 12, 2007). The three were convicted the following year, and Flowers was sentenced to eight years in prison. He was paroled in 1973 after serving 16 months. Flowers maintained that the prosecution was politically motivated by opponents of his anti-segregation stance, but the appeals courts affirmed the conviction. The portion of the Hobbs Act under which Flowers was convicted was later struck down as unconstitutionally vague.Hayman, p. 5. President Jimmy Carter granted him a pardon in 1978, after which Flowers' license to practice law was restored.Hayman, 'pp. 5 and 287. Family Because of the trouble in Alabama, his son Richmond Flowers Jr. declined an offer from Alabama Crimson Tide football coach Paul W. Bryant to play football at Alabama. Flowers Jr. had been an athlete in Alabama but played college football at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville and was instrumental, scoring the game-winning touchdown, in defeating Alabama and Coach Bryant during his senior season. At the time, his father watched from the stands in Neyland Stadium in handcuffs. Flowers Jr. was also a member of the University of Tennessee track team. He was a world-class hurdler and played in the National Football League with the Dallas Cowboys and the New York Giants. The third generation Richmond Flowers, III, is a former wide receiver at Duke University, who transferred to the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. He was drafted by the Jacksonville Jaguars but was cut from the team. He also tried out with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League. He now is an assistant coach for the Washington Redskins. Later years In his later years, Flowers taught criminal justice and U.S. history at Wallace Community College in Dothan, formerly the George C. Wallace State Community College, named for the father of his longstanding political rival. He was a legal advisor to Flowers Hospital. A member of First United Methodist Church, he taught the men's Bible class for twenty-five years. Flowers Jr. is the subject of a 1989 CBS television docudrama entitled Unconquered, with screenplay by Pat Conroy.

Courtesy photographer Peter Johansen. Jacques Calonne (born 1930 in Mons) is a Belgian artist, composer, singer, actor, logogramist, and writer. Life Calonne studied music from 1944‚Äì46 at the conservatories of Mons and Brussels, with amongst others the composer Andr√© Souris, who introduced him to the surrealist movement. He then pursued a course of art studies at the Acad√©mie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels from 1947 to 1949, when he attended ‚ÄúLa fin et les moyens‚Äù (The End and the Means), the first Belgian exhibition of the Cobra group at the Palais des Beaux-Arts de Bruxelles, where he met Christian Dotremont . He immediately attached himself to this movement, becoming its youngest member and taking part in its meetings in the rue de la Paille, as well as in its review and at the exposition \\"L‚ÄôObjet √† travers les √¢ges\\" (The Object through the Ages) . Dividing himself between music and visual arts, he continued to pursue a double career after the dissolution of Cobra . In 1954 he made his first visit to the Internationale Ferienkurse f√ºr neue Musik at Darmstadt, where he met Karlheinz Stockhausen and Bruno Maderna . In 1956 he exhibited paintings at the World Congress of Free Artists in Alba. He is, for all the manifestations of avant-garde, not so very much a nonconformist. In 1957, he co-signed the \\"Manifesto against Style\\" with, amongst others, Serge Vandercam, Pierre Restany, Yves Klein, Roel d‚ÄôHaese, and Pierre Alechinsky . In 1964, he began publishing his writings (e.g., the novel Belle que jamais, published in Strates, one of Dotremont‚Äôs journals) while continuing his musical activities . His 1959 composition Quadrangles was performed on 24 January 1965 at the Wallraf-Richartz Museum in Cologne, in the concert series of the second Cologne Courses for New Music . In 1971, he created the first of his ink-on-music-paper works and published sixteen lithographs, with the title \\"Muettes\\", in the Daily Bul. In the following year, he resumed painting in oils on paper and fabric, and exhibited at the Venice Biennale. Perpetuating the spirit of Cobra, he employed the principle of nonspecialization, cherished by the group, creating logograms together with Dotremont. In 1981, he painted on assemblages of match boxes. Though he exhibited in 1949 as a member of Cobra, his first one-man show was mounted only in 1970 at the Dierickx gallery in Brussels. Subsequently, he exhibited many times in this city, where he lives in the working-class neighbourhood of Marolles. He frequently participates in collective exhibitions in Belgium and abroad. His graphic and pictorial work is in the tradition of the plastic practice of writing which developed in Belgium. The rhythm of the elements, the musicality of their distribution in the appropriation of space, and extreme scriptuary fluidity of the symbols reveal the very personal contribution of this musician who paints and draws visual scores . In 1995 he played the r√¥le of the Representative of the Ministry of Culture in the demonic Camping Cosmos (1996).

He drafted wisely in the 1968 AL Expansion Draft, supervised the founding and operation of the Kansas City Royals Baseball Academy, a revolutionary training ground for elite athletes without significant baseball experience, and built a strong farm system. By 1971, their third season, the Royals sported a winning record‚Äîearning Tallis the Executive of the Year Award from The Sporting News that season.Hardball Times Two years later, the Royals moved into a state-of- the-art new ballpark called Royals Stadium, now called by its current name, Kauffman Stadium. But in June , Tallis was replaced as Kansas City's GM by Joe Burke, former general manager of the Texas Rangers. Under Burke, players signed and developed during Tallis' tenure‚Äîsuch as Baseball Hall of Famer George Brett‚Äîwould mature to help Kansas City dominate the American League West Division during the latter part of the 1970s. Tallis, however, soon joined the front office of the Yankees, reporting to George Steinbrenner and Yankee president/GM Gabe Paul. Tallis' first task in the Bronx was to serve as the club's supervisor of the successful 1974‚Äì75 renovation of Yankee Stadium. After the 1977 season, and the Yankees' first world championship in 15 years, Paul resigned to become president of the Cleveland Indians. In the front office overhaul that followed, Tallis was named Yankee general manager. Tallis held the title during the 1978 and 1979 seasons, although owner Steinbrenner took an integral role in the team's day-to-day operations and at one point named manager Bob Lemon as the team's GM-designate during the middle of the 1978 season. During Tallis' administration, the Yankees continued their aggressive role in baseball free agency (notably signing Hall of Fame relief pitcher Goose Gossage). In his first season, New York roared back from a -game midseason deficit to beat the Boston Red Sox in a one-game playoff for the 1978 AL East flag, defeat Tallis' old Royals club for the third consecutive season in the ALCS, then take the 1978 World Series in six games from the Los Angeles Dodgers. The following year, however, the Yankees suffered the tragic loss of catcher and team captain Thurman Munson in an August plane crash and finished fourth, games in arrears of the Baltimore Orioles. Tallis was replaced as general manager by Gene Michael at the end of the season. He spent three more years in the Yankee front office as an executive vice president before leaving the organization in 1982. He then became executive director of the Tampa Bay Baseball Group, which was established to lure a Major League club to the Tampa Bay area. Although the group nearly convinced the Chicago White Sox to move to the Florida enclave, it did not succeed in its mission during Tallis' lifetime. He died of a heart attack in Tampa at the age of 76 in 1991. All told, Tallis had a 43-year career in baseball management. References *Obituary, The New York Times, May 8, 1991.

Biography Giaccone was born in the Ridgewood, Queens. His father died during the 1930s, leaving Giaccone, his sisters and brothers, and mother to fend for themselves during the Great Depression. Serving as an altarboy, Giaccone grew up as a strict Catholic. Giaccone had good grades in school and graduated from high school. As a young man, he became a protegee of Bonanno underboss Giovanni Bonventre. Giaccone had a wife Annette, a daughter Corinne, and a son Phillip Giaccone Jr. He was an in-law to Gambino crime family boss Carlo Gambino. Giaccone's legitimate business was Pinto Trucking, a trucking firm in South Ozone Park, Queens that served also as a headquarters for his crew. During his life, Giaccone was never convicted of a crime. By the mid-1970s, the Bonanno family was in turmoil. After official boss Philip Rastelli went to prison in 1975, capo Carmine Galante took control of the family. It is suspected that the heads of the other New York Five Families collaborated with Rastelli to arrange Galante's death; they supposedly viewed Galante's greed and ambition as a threat to all their interests. On July 12, 1979, gunmen, one of whom was allegedly Anthony Indelicato, murdered Galante at Joe & Mary's Italian-American restaurant in Bushwick, Brooklyn.Raab, pp. 607‚Äì608 After the Galante murder, a fight for control of the family started. Joseph Massino began jockeying for power with Dominick \\"Sonny Black\\" Napolitano, another Rastelli loyalist capo. Both men were themselves threatened by another faction seeking to depose the absentee boss led by capos Alphonse \\"Sonny Red\\" Indelicato, Dominick \\"Big Trin\\" Trincera and Giaccone.DeStefano 2007, pp. 99, 101‚Äì103 The Commission initially tried to maintain neutrality, but in 1981, Massino got word from his informants that the three capos were stocking up on automatic weapons and planning to kill the Rastelli loyalists within the Bonanno family to take complete control. Massino turned to Colombo crime family boss Carmine Persico and Gambino boss Paul Castellano for advice; they told him to act immediately. The three capos murder On May 5, 1981, Massino loyalists shot and killed Giaccone, Trinchera, and Indelicato in a Brooklyn night club. On the pretext of working out a peace agreement, Massino had invited them to meet with him at the 20/20 Night Club in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. However, Massino's real plan was to assassinate the capos. The ambush was set in the club store room, with Salvatore Vitale and three other gunmen wearing ski masks hiding in a closet. One of the gunmen was mobster Vito Rizzuto, who came from Montreal, Quebec, Canada with another Canadian mobster to help Massino.\\"Aftermath of a Hit\\" by David Amoruso Gangsters Inc. May 8, 2007 Massino told the men to avoid shooting so that bullets wouldn't spray around the room. Massino also brought drop cloths and ropes for disposing of the bodies afterwards. When the capos arrived at the 20/20, Massino and Bonanno mobster Gerlando Sciascia and Frank Lino escorted them to the store room. As the men entered the room, Sciascia brushed his hand through his hair, giving the prearranged signal. Vitale and gunmen rushed out of the closet, with Rizzuto yelling \\"it's a hold up\\". Massino immediately punched Giaccone, knocking him to the floor, and also stopping Indelicato from escaping. Giaccone got up and tried to run out of the room, but was blocked up against a wall with Trinchera. The gunmen killed Giaccone with a volley of submachine gun fire. The three capos were unarmed, as was the rule when attending a peace meeting. Lino, who had escaped, was brought instead of Indelicato's son, but was quickly won over to Massino's side.Raab, p. 615 After the killings, the Bonanno gunmen transported the three bodies to a lot in Lindenwood, Queens, in an area known as The Hole. The lot was a Gambino mob graveyard; Gambino crime family capo John Gotti arranged for his men to bury the bodies there as a favor to Massino.\\"Bloody B'klyn Rubout: Says Massino OKd '81 mob hit\\" by John Marzulli, New York Daily News June 30, 2004\\"In Court, Evidence Suggests Gotti Associates Buried Victims in Lot\\" by William K.

He was also a renowned educationist and a poet. His major contribution to linguistics was in finding out some basic relationship between Santali and the Bengali language. He showed how the Bengali language has unique characteristics, absent in other Indian languages, under the influence of Santali. His contribution was fundamental to research on the origin and development of the Bengali language and provided scopes of research in newer horizons in linguistics. Life Byomkes Chakrabarti, son of Sarat Chandra Chakrabarti and Sitala Sundari Chakrabarti, was born in Kharar-Gopinathpur village in the Paschim Medinipur district of West Bengal, India, in 1923. He took his M.A. degrees in English and Bengali from Calcutta University. He was the first Ph.D. on the Santali language from this university. Dr. Chakrabarti came in close contact with Dr. Suniti Kumar Chatterji and Dr. Sukumar Sen as their student and imbibed aptitude for linguistic studies from these teachers in the field. His acquaintance with the tribal bases of the Midnapur district induced him to study their culture. He concentrated on the Santali culture in particular and acquired sound knowledge of Santali language. He carried on systematic research on the comparative study of Santali and Bengali languages. Dr. Chakrabarti started his career as a head master and subsequently held the position of the Principal in Seva Bharati Mahavidyalaya in Kapgari, Jhargram, West Midnapur district and Raja Birendra Chandra College in Kandi, Murshidabad district of West Bengal. Death put an end to his career in 1981. Research work At Kandi, 1981 Chakrabarti's work covers all the aspects of phonetics and phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics and general characteristics of the languages in literature and vocabulary. Santali, belonging to the Austroasiatic family and having a tradition traceable from pre-Aryan days retained its distinct identity and co-existed with Bengali, a language belonging to the Indo-Aryan family, in Bengal. This affiliation is generally accepted, but there are many cross-questions and puzzles. In modern Indian languages like Western Hindi the steps of evolution from Midland Prakrit Sauraseni can be traced clearly. In the case of Bengali such steps of evolution are not always clear and distinct. One has to look at other influences that moulded Bengali's essential characteristics. Chakrabarti investigated the complex process of assimilation of non-Aryan elements, particularly the Santali elements, by Bengali and he showed the overwhelming influence of Bengali on Santali. His formulations are based on the detailed study of reciprocal influences on all aspects of both the languages and try to bring out the unique features of the languages.

In part, it is a sequel to House of Blue Leaves, with one character from that play, Ron Shaughnessy, appearing in Chaucer in Rome. Synopsis The play is set in Rome during the Holy Year of Jubilee, which is extremely crowded with pilgrims seeking confession and absolution. The plot focuses on Matt, a celebrated painter who resides at the American Academy in Rome with his lover, Sarah, and his best friend, Pete. Sarah and Pete are both scholars; Pete is analyzing sociopolitical themes in artistic depictions of Christ's fingernails. Matt has recently recovered from squamous cell carcinoma, and Pete and Sarah are horrified to discover that Matt's cancer was caused by his deliberate use of carcinogenic chemicals in his paintings of beautiful landscapes, as a political statement on environmental pollution. Meanwhile, Pete's life is complicated by the arrival of his parents, Ron and Dolo. (Ron is a returning character who featured prominently in House of Blue Leaves.) Pete suggests that Matt change mediums, and eventually convinces him to try film. However, when Matt decides that his newest project will be to impersonate a priest and secretly videotape the confessions of pilgrims, the results threaten to drive Pete's already unstable parents over the edge.

Although reflecting the Lebanese political tensions at various times, the level of openness and the ability to voice dissenting opinions has gradually increased with time, and at one point it has been reasonably argued that users from any political affiliation have been able to freely express their thoughts and opinions. This openness, although still relatively present, has however decreased over the past few years. The Orange Room was closed by Tayyar.org on October 5, 2012 after almost 10 years of great success, 21000 members, 1,110,000 posts and millions of views. Mid October 2012, The Orange Room reopened. The online forum parted ways with Tayyar.org's hosting service and continues to serve its community independently. The Orange Room is now hosted on Oroom.org.

A notable fact is that it has enabled direct communication between Israeli and Lebanese citizens. Orange Room Supporters private forum The Private Forum for the Orange Room Supporters is reserved for members who have paid an annual registration fee. This forum is not moderated (however censorship on profanity and obscene language still applies) and only Orange Room Supporters can post and read it. Community forums The Community Forums, also referred to as Cool ForumsThe Orange Room Why spend time in the CF? by Orange Room staff and members, is the space reserved for all non-political discussions. It is divided into 7 subforums: * Lebanon Away From Politics: Non-political topics about Lebanon, including history, culture, environment, tourism and social issues * Classifieds, Jobs, Education & Business * Self Improvement: topics such as health, fitness, diet, exercise, religion, meditation, beauty and attire * Science and Technology * Books, Movies, Music, TV & Entertainment * Sports Center * The Lounge: Topics that do not fit in the above categories Research forums The Research Forums are in theory a repository of raw, factual information. The Orange Room states that the Research Forums go \\"beyond opinions, to facts\\". * Archival: Serves as a repository for historical documents, elections numbers, interviews, government, municipalities and political parties administrative contacts and resources. Archival seeks to help reduce the fragmentation of the historical record by connecting events whose temporal and spatial relationships are often obscured by a mass of contradicting and disconnected literature, the biases of the media, and the tendency for important past events to be relegated to the annals of forgotten history. By reducing the fragmentation of the historical record, this project hopes to reduce the amount of time it takes for the public to acquire a full and coherent picture of an event or issue. This section is dedicated for all the inputs that are related to archives such as: Historical documents; Election campaigns and results; Important press conferences and interviews; Government administrative, municipality and ministerial contacts and resources; FPM committee's contacts and resources; Etc. ... In order to better organize the Archival, this section is divided into the following four parts: 1) Historical Archives: Archives for all kinds of historical events from the World, Lebanon and FPM. 2) National and FPM Media: Directory and resource to all the media outlets, journalists, reporters, and media shows. 3) Elections and Campaigns: Archives to all kinds of elections; Covering candidates, campaigns, results and other related info. 4) The Government & the Parliament: Directory for government resources, ministries directories, MPs & politicians contacts and FPM's offices and committees contacts. * Research: Serves as a repository for governmental, FPM and other political party's achievements. Reports and biographies on many political and social personalities are also available. In addition, different political, social, economical and technological matters are studied objectively. The Research section is to provide means for members of LFPM.ORG to monitor the activities of political entities, such as governments, Change & Reform Bloc, FPM and other parties. In this capacity, the RF should be regarded as a tool that enables members to operate as a sort of people's intelligence agency. To initiate an investigation of a certain issue, entity, or event, a user first creates a time line and a clear description of the project or the thread. LFPM.ORG members begin adding events, entities, and relationships to that thread. Production and Acquisition: To increase the efficiency of information production: RF is premised on the notion that collaboration in a networked ‚Äúopen-content‚Äù environment can greatly improve the efficiency and quality of information production in the public sphere as it allows contributors to build upon and improve the work of others in real time as part of an LFPM.ORG community. To increase the efficiency of information acquisition: In order to avoid being faced with many threads in which members ending up debating for the sake of repeating a position (with or against) they heard from someone they trust, without really being provided deep professional insight into the matter. Therefore, RF interferes in certain threads, where professional insight is required to make the judgment easier on members and readers. This section is dedicated to all inputs that are related, but not limited, to: Governments, FPM and all other political party achievements; All political and social personalities; Research on different political, social, economical and technological matters. The division here will come in three different categories: 1) Politics: Research on different political matters and monitor the activities of Governments, FPM and other political parties. 2) Economy & Finance: Research on issues related to World and Lebanese economy. 3) People & Life: Research on issues related to different activities that affects our society. * RF Info: Contains help tools and information about the Research Forums. In addition to the regular Forum Rules, the Research Forum has the following additions: 1) All articles posted on this forum should have a reliable source. i.e. either an operating link, or a reliable reference. 2) Only Facts and analyzes based on facts are acceptable. You cannot post your interpretation of the story; this is not a discussion forum. 3) All threads should have a clear statement on its initiative and its benefits. 4) All posts and threads need the approval of the moderators.

It ran parallel to James Street, one block west. The western end of Roosevelt Street later became the walkway from Park Row to the front entrance of the Chatham Green Apartments at 165 Park Row.  History  Roosevelt Street was named after a Roosevelt who owned property in the area from the time of Dutch settlement of New Amsterdam. It was not named after either president of the United States with the same surname, Teddy Roosevelt or Franklin Roosevelt. The street is historically significant as the place where the mob of the New York City draft riots - a violent protest against conscription for the American Civil War - assembled before heading uptown to the draft offices. The Roosevelt Street Ferry was displaced by the construction of the New York (north) tower of the Brooklyn Bridge.

He is believed to have ruled during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Abipa was the son of Egunoju and one of his queens. He was reportedly born when the royal party was on the road approaching Igboho (his name is contracted from a bi si ipa - 'one who is born on the wayside'). Prior to his reign, three rulers of Oyo had presided from Oyo-Igboho instead of the capital city Oyo-Ile, due to external threats from the Nupe and internal squabbles. Abipa was the Alaafin who moved the capital back to Oyo- Ile after both threats were subdued. The return to Oyo-Ile occurred in the early seventeenth century. According to tradition, some nobles who wanted the capital to stay at Oyo-Igboho sent people to masquerade as phantoms when Abipa's advance party visited the site of the former capital. Abipa realised what was happening, and sent hunters to round up the bogus phantoms. For this he is also known as Oba m'oro, 'the king who caught ghosts'. The story is still re-enacted during annual festivals at Oyo and on the installation of a new Alaafin. When the royal party entered Oyo-Ile, Abipa offered his newly born son to be sacrificed. For this action his oriki calls him 'the royal catcher of ghosts who sacrificed his son for the peace of the world'. He was succeeded by Obalokun.

His artwork is sometimes referred to as meticulous realism, a subcategory referring to the artist's startling attention to detail. The 1950s Kent Bellows was born on June 26, 1949, in Blair, Nebraska. As a young boy, Bellows attended Saturday film matinees at the Town Theater and became enamored with cinema, an interest that continued throughout his life and was influential to his art. He was known in the small community as ‚Äúthat kid who can draw‚Äù.Article by Doug Janousek, The Pilot- Tribune. Blair, Nebraska, November 17, 1986 The 1960s Bellows‚Äô father was a commercial artist and watercolorist. He recognized his son's natural inclination towards art and taught him what he knew from his own training and experience. In later years, Bellows referred to his father as his ‚Äúbest critic‚Äù and ‚Äúa great influence.‚ÄùArticle by Robert McMorris, Omaha World- Herald, November 8, 1986 In 1965, Bellows, his parents, and his two younger sisters moved to Omaha, Nebraska, where he attended high school. He earned money selling artwork and playing keyboards with rock-and-roll bands. Following high school, Bellows studied art history at the local university for two years and experimented with various artistic styles and mediums. During this time, he continued to play keyboards with bands, including performers Sonny and Cher during a Midwest tour. The 1970s Making a decision to focus solely on developing his artistic talent, Bellows sought out patrons in the tradition of the old masters for financial support. These included Omaha native Warren Buffett. Mr. Buffett referred Bellows to his wife, Susie, a lover of the arts. Mrs. Buffett agreed to provide support for one year in exchange for artwork. Out of this relationship developed a lifelong friendship. In 1970, Bellows resided briefly in Connecticut and then moved to Berkeley, California, but soon settled back in Omaha, where he lived for the remainder of his life. Bellows‚Äô early works were included in Joslyn Art Museum‚Äôs 1970 Midwest Biennial Show as well as other exhibitions around Omaha. His early works included abstracts and figurative pieces, some with a Native American theme. Acrylic was his primary medium during this period. In 1971, Bellows took his first trip to Europe to study the art of the great masters throughout Italy and France. In 1972, his work was halted due to pain caused by a ganglion cyst that was wound around the tendons of his left wrist. This was crippling for Bellows, who was left-handed. He was referred to the Mayo Clinic, where the cyst was removed in a long and complicated surgery. Bellows soaked his wrist in a therapeutic hot wax bath daily for the rest of his life to treat his lingering wrist pain. After renting a house with a friend and then living in a patron‚Äôs carriage house for a year, Bellows moved into a midtown Omaha apartment, where he lived and worked for the remainder of the decade. He lived there with Elizabeth Irvin, to whom he was married in 1976. Bellows earned a portion of his living during this period through illustration work for publications such as Omni and Rolling Stone, often with a science fiction theme. One such illustration, which appeared in Rolling Stone in 1975, featured science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, who later wrote in a letter to Bellows, ‚ÄúYou gave me a reflected self or identity and I suddenly believed I was real‚Ä¶From the moment I saw your picture, I was changed back to my old, real self‚Ä¶you cured me of my identity-less sickness. This is heavy stuff, but true.‚ÄùPaul Williams, Only Apparently Real: The World of Philip K. Dick. New York: Arbor House Publishing, 1986 The 1980s Bellows and his wife divorced in 1979. A year later, Bellows met and married Angela Shomaker. Bellows, Angela, and her three children from a former marriage moved into an older home in midtown Omaha where Bellows set up a studio in the basement. He supported his new family through commissioned portraiture throughout the early 1980s. This period led the artist to a more serious focus on the human figure, and a greater interest in the medium of graphite. In 1985, Bellows learned that New York gallery owner Peter Tatistcheff was coming to the region, and Bellows asked a Blair man who owned several of Bellows‚Äô works to invite the gallery owner to join him for dinner as a scheme for Bellows to meet him and share his portfolio. Two weeks later, Bellows had signed with the Tatistcheff Gallery. This event marked the start of a very prolific period of two decades during which Bellows produced primarily figurative artwork using graphite, charcoal, pastel, egg tempera, acrylic, and oil. Commenting on his meticulous approach, Bellows stated in 1986, ‚ÄúThe image I create on the canvas is the difference between the reality of a photograph and what is actually happening. This makes for a finely tuned picture, enabling me to capture the subject‚Äôs soul.‚ÄùArticle by Doug Janousek, The Pilot-Tribune. Blair, Nebraska, November 17, 1986 Bellows was reluctant to talk about the meaning of specific works. In 1988, he said, ‚ÄúI try to depict the inner life of the subject, to give outward form to an inner state. I think my pictures have stories behind them, but I like to leave a feeling of openness. I hope that things keep going in the viewer‚Äôs mind. There‚Äôs nothing more boring than a story too quickly told. Once all the elements of a story are nailed down, the viewer is left with nothing but the artist‚Äôs technique.‚ÄùArticle by Cindy Connolly, Magazine of the Midlands, Sunday World-Herald. Omaha, Nebraska, November 13, 1988 During the 1980s, Bellows‚Äô works were included in exhibits at: *Tatistcheff Gallery, New York City *Museum of the Surreal and Fantastique, New York City *Arkansas Arts Center, Little Rock, Arkansas *Huntsville Museum of Art, Huntsville, Alabama *Hirschl and Adler, New York City *Harris, Samuel, and Company Gallery, Coconut Grove, Florida *National Academy of Design, New York City *Smith College Museum of Art, Northampton, Massachusetts *Butler Institute of American Art, Youngstown, Ohio *Sheldon Art Museum, Lincoln, Nebraska *Nelson- Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City, Missouri *New Britain Museum of American Art, New Britain, Connecticut *Squibb Gallery, Princeton, New Jersey *Toledo Museum of Art, Toledo, Ohio In 1989, Bellows purchased a large building in midtown Omaha that he christened the Mahler Building, after the composer Gustav Mahler. Once home to the Mermaid Lounge, Bellows renovated the building and used it as his studio, with space to build large sets to use as backdrops to his artwork. Regarding the design and creation of actual sets as backdrops to his work, he remarked, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a real little bit of Hollywood, the way I work.‚Äù Article by Kyle MacMillan, Magazine of the Midlands, Sunday World- Herald. Omaha, Nebraska, August 27, 1989 In 1992, Bellows also described his art as ‚Äúlittle movies that don‚Äôt move‚Ä¶ I try to make art that is really part of me, that there is just no question about it. I get that from a Bergman film. I get that from Scorsese. I get that from David Lynch.‚ÄùArticle by Kyle MacMillan, Magazine of the Midlands, Sunday World-Herald. Omaha, Nebraska, April 5, 1992 The 1990s Bellows and his second wife divorced in 1991. This had an enormous impact on Bellows and on his art, which became darker and more intense, often including religious themes. Bellows talked about the relationship between his art and his personal life in a 1992 Nebraska Educational Television documentary, ‚ÄúWhat is Art?‚Äù ‚ÄúTalk about saving the world. It does save my world. It‚Äôs the way I just kind of claw and finds my way through the darkness. I mean that‚Äôs it. I can‚Äôt imagine a life without making art. Joseph Campbell, in one of his lectures, said something that struck me‚Äîthat artists are generally people who have come apart at the seams somewhere along the line, and their work is an attempt to put themselves back together again, or at least keep themselves together. That‚Äôs definitely what my work is about.‚Äù Later, Bellows added, ‚ÄúThese projects work for me. It‚Äôs clarified my thinking. The thing about an experience like divorce for me is it‚Äôs just the way that the meaning drains out of your life. This has been my way to try to put it back, just to make sense of the experience. And it‚Äôs working, it‚Äôs working. I feel a lot calmer about it. I think that‚Äôs one thing about our culture. Just a part of our culture where any bad thing, just push it down, avoid it‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt feel it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm trying to actually just feel it‚Ä¶ because that‚Äôs the thing about emotions, they have a purpose. I mean, I‚Äôm no psychologist, but for myself, to actually experience it in a complete way and survive it. They don‚Äôt go away, but you process that material and then you go on to the next thing. I think that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing.‚ÄùWhat is Art? Nebraska Educational Television Production, 1972 Shortly after his divorce, Bellows traveled to Europe for the second time, this time primarily studying artwork in Florence, Italy. Bellows often looked to the old masters for his inspiration. In 1992, he stated, ‚ÄúI feel like my real teachers were the older painters. They were the ones. I would go to Joslyn, and feel like I learned how to apply paint from what I saw down there.‚ÄùArticle by Kyle MacMillan, Magazine of the Midlands, Sunday World-Herald. Omaha, Nebraska, April 5, 1992 He once said that he frequently did self-portraits because it is the tradition of artists, especially those he admired most‚Äîthe artists of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.Article by Doug Janousek, The Pilot-Tribune. Blair, Nebraska, November 17, 1986 Bellows also spoke of the influence of nineteenth- century American painter, Thomas Eakins, on his work, and referred to him as his ‚Äúgreat American hero.‚ÄùArticle by Kyle MacMillan, Magazine of the Midlands, Sunday World-Herald. Omaha, Nebraska, August 27, 1989 He described Gregory Gillespie, a contemporary figurative artist, as another great inspiration. In 1993, Bellows left Tatistcheff Gallery to join Forum Gallery in New York City. Following his 1991 divorce, Bellows had continued to reside in his midtown Omaha home along with his two teenage stepdaughters, but by 1994, they had moved out, and he sold the house to a long-time friend. Bellows moved into his nearby studio building, where he lived and worked for the remainder of his life. During the 1990s, Bellows‚Äô works were included in exhibits at: *Tatistcheff Gallery, New York City *Museum of Nebraska Art, Kearney, Nebraska *Arkansas Arts Center, Little Rock, Arkansas *North Miami Center of Contemporary Art, Miami, Florida *Midtown Payson Gallery, New York City *Chicago International Art Exposition, Navy Pier, Chicago, Illinois *Philbrook Museum of Art, Tulsa, Oklahoma *Forum Gallery, New York City *Art Dealers‚Äô Association of America, Seventh Regiment Armory, New York City *Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois. 2000-2005 By 2003, Bellows had begun expressing great concern about increasing pain and diminished flexibility in his left wrist and hand, apparently related to the earlier surgery, overuse, and an additional developing condition known as Dupuytren's contracture, common in his mother's family. Bellows‚Äô ability to work was increasingly impacted.

The islands are known for their quiet seclusion and nature trails. History Early history While Niagara Falls, New York became more well known for industry development along the lower river's edge in the 1870s, the industrial revolution started much earlier on the Canadian side. In 1794, permission was granted to erect a saw and grist mill at the eastern end of the islands. This was followed by an iron ore mill constructed in 1796. Ownership of the properties was transferred to area pioneers Samuel Street and Thomas Clark by 1801, with the islands named Clark Hill Islands in 1805. The mills were burned by American forces on July 26, 1814, following the Battle of Lundy's Lane during the War of 1812. Thomas Clark \\"T.C.\\" Street took ownership of Clark Hill Islands in 1854, renaming them Cynthia Islands. They became accessible to the public in 1877, when Sutherland Macklem, Street's heir, built a pair of suspension bridges to carry foot & carriage traffic across. Pedestrian traffic had already been flocking to the surrounding grounds since the mid-1820s to visit The Burning Spring, billed as Niagara Falls' \\"first tourist attraction\\". It continued in operation for nearly sixty years, until the Niagara Parks Commission took over the property and Cynthia Islands as well, in 1887. Early 1900s: The Islands evolve When the Parks Commission took over, they renamed the islands in honor of Canadian Governor-General Lord Dufferin, who had been instrumental in establishing parkland along the river to replace \\"The Front\\", a notoriously rowdy tourist area. The islands remained untouched until 1902, when the Ontario Power Company began construction on their lower river power facility, which required river water to be drawn from a point just east of the islands. The water diversion reduced the flow through the islands to an extent that the power company, through an earlier agreement with the Parks Commission, created a series of man-made islands and cascades to compensate. Initial work was completed by 1905, but the Parks Commission rejected the resulting layout, saying the arrangement was too formal and \\"out of place with the surroundings.\\" Beginning in 1918, surplus dirt & stone were placed strategically around the islands, giving them a more natural look. Public Usage Except for the years of World War II when the islands were barricaded, the public has enjoyed free access. For many years, bathing and swimming areas were located here, first established in 1907 and moving to a site further west by 1962. This area remained in use until the early 2000s, when it was removed due to safety concerns brought on by swimmers diving from surrounding bridges into the shallow water, as well as maintenance issues. The north end of the islands also featured paddleboats, a service began in 1973 by the Niagara Parks Commission. The paddleboats were removed in the early 1990s, presumably out of safety as well.

He is most well known for being a great public speaker. During DeSantis' lifetime, he grew to become a huge Baseball fan and big fan of the Detroit Tigers.Jones, Chris: Leamington Tribune - Tony De Santis: 1960 ; Mr. Baseball in Leamington ; Entrepreneur built Drury Lane empire; hobnobbed with stars Life and career DeSantis was born in Gary, Indiana and began his career in show business as a trumpet player in Chicago. In 1935, he was nearly killed in an explosion at the Glidden paint factory where he was working. In 1940, he purchased a club on Michigan Avenue before moving out of Chicago to nearby Evergreen Park, where he opened the Martinique Restaurant, which was highly acclaimed. He began producing plays in 1949 in a tent adjacent to the restaurant to attract customers. The enterprise was successful, prompting him to build his first theatre. Drury Lane Theaters The DeSantis theatres were named after the historic Theatre Royal Drury Lane, built in London in the 17th century. His five suburban Chicago locations all provided affordable dinner theatre that was appropriate for families. DeSantis claimed that alcohol sales were profitable; if you broke even when operating a theatre, you were successful. *Drury Lane Evergreen Park was DeSantis' first theatre in the Chicago area. It opened in 1958 and was a local entertainment landmark for 45 years before closing in 2003.Munson, Nancy: Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News, June 19, 2003-Wal-Mart to Replace Dinner Theater in Evergreen Park, IL *Drury Lane Oak Brook Terrace opened in 1984, and it benefited from what DeSantis had learned over the years.

He was opposed to Chicago mafia involvement in Chicago show business and in 1958 was involved in an FBI sting against the Chicago mob. This led to a retaliatory explosion in his Martinique nightclub in 1962. In reflecting on his life in 2005, DeSantis said: > \\"I suppose I could sit on a bench and drink martinis with a starlet on each > arm. Nah. I work hard because I am just trying to keep alive.\\" Honors and awards In 1971, DeSantis was made an associate Officer of the Venerable Order of Saint John. This was followed in 1980 by a promotion to the rank of associate knight in the same Order. DeSantis was a very generous supporter of Roman Catholic charities in Chicago.

A Longfellow, Alden & Harlow-designed mansion that was originally the home of the pastor of a neighboring church and former university chancellor, it also served as the home to a local chapter of the Knights of Columbus, as chemical laboratories, and as the first home of educational television station WQED and that station's original production site for Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. Today it is home to the University of Pittsburgh's Department of Music and the school's Theodore M. Finney Music Library. History The original mansion was designed by Longfellow, Alden & Harlow as a sandstone Richardsonian Romanesque mansion in 1884. The mansion was commissioned by Carrie T. Holland, youngest daughter of pioneer Pittsburgh iron manufacturer James K. Moorehead, as a gift for her husband William Jacob Holland, pastor of Bellefield Presbyterian Church at Fifth and Bellefield avenues in the Oakland section of Pittsburgh. William Jacob Holland was also a nationally recognized zoologist, paleontologist, and entomologist and went on to become a trustee (1886) and then chancellor (1891‚Äì1901) of the University of Pittsburgh, then called the Western University of Pennsylvania. The Holland's house sat across the street from Holland's church, Bellefield Presbyterian, a wooden structure that was replaced by a stone Richardsonian Romanesque structure designed by Frederick J. Osterling in 1890 that matched his house. The Hollands sold their house some time before 1912. It became a Knights of Columbus club before being purchased in 1936 by Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company for laboratory operations of its subsidiary, Columbia-Southern Chemical Corporation. Pittsburgh Plate Glass donated the building to the University of Pittsburgh in 1953 in order for the university to establish it as the home for the city's first educational television station, WQED. The building therefore became the original home of the Public Broadcasting Service station, and the original production site of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, before becoming the home of Pitt's music department. A one-story addition was added presumably in the 1920s which was given a Richardsonian Romanesque stone facing, estimated to have been added in the 1950s, that matched the original house. The university's Department of Music moved into the building in 1971 from its previous quarters on the ninth floor of the Cathedral of Learning. The Music Building was renovated in 2003 which included the installation of elevators. It also houses the Music Department Library, a piano lab, the electronic music studio, the ethnomusicology lab, a student/faculty lounge, practice rooms, teaching studios, offices, seminar rooms, and classrooms. It also contains the William Russell Robinson Recording Studio that is a 32-track digital recording facility which offer students hands-on experience in the latest recording techniques and technology. In 1967, the Bellefield Presbyterian Church merged with and moved to the First United Presbyterian Church at Fifth and Thackeray, which adopted its name. The old church was dismantled in 1985 except for its tower, which still stands. Library Music Building at the University of Pittsburgh. Ruskin Hall can be seen behind the building on the left. The Theodore M. Finney Music Library is located in the basement of the Music Building and contains a general music research collection as well as several collections of important musical materials. The library is named for the former head of the music department who donated his personal collection to the school. The library's holdings include approximately 65,000 music scores and books, 25,000 sound recordings, 1,500 microforms, and 150 journals. Collections include Early American hymnals and tunebooks, volumes of sheet music with regional significance, seventeenth and eighteenth century prints of English sacred and secular works, and music belonging to the late William Steinberg and Fidelis Zitterbart.

She made her film debut in the Spanish film Princesas which was directed by Fernando Le√≥n de Aranoa, in which she played Zulema, an illegal immigrant from the Dominican Republic trying to make a living as a prostitute on the streets of Madrid, Spain. Her performance in this film earned her a Goya Award for Best New Actress in 2006, making her the first Puerto Rican actress to win this notable award. Biography Born in Carolina, Puerto Rico, Nev√°rez was educated in local military schools in order to improve her English. At the age of 10, her parents decided to relocate to New York City, where she focused her education to prepare her for a medical career. However, on the side she continued to dabble in the arts as a hobby. It was her stepfather who changed her mind and help encouraged her to follow her dreams and desire to become an actress.August 2006 Micaela Nev√°rez ‚ÄòPrincesa‚Äô del destino from El Diario La Prensa 24 August 2006 Fate stepped in when she was discovered by director Fernando Le√≥n de Aranoa who was in New York promoting his latest film Lunes al Sol starring acclaimed Spanish actor Javier Bardem. Nev√°rez, who frequented a popular bar/restaurant called \\"Oliva\\" in lower Manhattan on their popular salsa music nights, captured the director's attention so much that he asked her to audition for a role in his upcoming film. Due to the recent death of her stepfather, she at first declined his offer and recommended a friend for the role, however, after the director personally had Bardem (an actor whom she greatly admires) deliver the script to her in person, did she accept his offer. After some initial conversations, she was flown to Spain for some screen tests. On the evening of January 29, 2006 in the presence of thousands of Spain's top artists and directors, Nev√°rez beat four other actresses in being named Best New Actress at the annual Goya Awards which were held in Madrid's Palacio Municipal de Congreso. By winning this award, Nev√°rez became the first Puerto Rican performer to win this prestigious film honor and one of the few Latin American actresses to do so as well. The news of her win reached her native Puerto Rico immediately where she was honored with an audience with Governor An√≠bal Acevedo Vil√° in the La Fortaleza, who congratulated her on her win. As of 2008, she resided with her French husband in London. Nev√°rez launched her film career in the United States with a supporting role in the independent film The War Boys starring Victor Rasuk and Peter Gallagher. Nev√°rez played Marta, Rasuk's love interest in the 2009 film, which was based on a play by Naomi Wallace.

It is a sequel to My Wife is a Gangster 2. This movie, however bearing the My Wife is a Gangster title, has little to no relation to the previous movies.  Plot  Korean gangster Han Ki-Chul (Lee Beom-soo) is put in charge by his Big Boss of looking after Lim Aryong (Shu Qi) who comes from Hong Kong. They expect Lim Aryong to be some big male gangster but she turns out to be a woman and acts very cold toward him and his associates. Moreover, none of them speak her language and she doesn't understand Korean. A translator called Yeon-Hee (Hyun Young) arrives. She is immature and very scared of the gangsters so at the beginning, instead of translating Aryong's rather rude answers, she changes them to nice ones. Quickly, Aryong shows her fierce fighting skills beating other bosses to save her companions. Ki-Chul and his associates who are rather unskilled, are impressed and become afraid of her while, upon finding that they are actually nice, she's trying to be more friendly. Her efforts are ruined by Yeon-Hee who, taking advantage of Aryoung's fear-some aura, 'translates' very threatening sentences. Soon after, they are attacked by professional assassins. They think that they are after Ki-Chul while, in fact, they want to kill Aryong who is the daughter of a boss in Hong Kong and is accused of having killed another boss, triggering a gangster war there. They then separate and Aryong and Ki-Chul's car is chased by the assassins but they manage to take refuge in his family. His parents believe that she is his girlfriend and give him a family necklace to give her. The assassins find her again but she overcomes them, especially the woman who really killed the boss. She then goes to meet her mother who is the reason why she chose to hide in Korea, but seeing that she found a new family and is happy, she gives up speaking to her. After that, she leaves Korea despite Ki-Chul's confession, even if she accepts the necklace. In Hong Kong, her father (Ti Lung) dies from his injuries caused by an explosion decided by the other boss. Even though Ki- Chul comes to support her, she leaves to take revenge. She then fights the other boss's gangsters with success and eventually she faces the boss. After cheating, he was going to shoot her as Ki-Chul arrives, distracting him. The boss shoots Ki-Chul first, allowing Aryong to come close to him and to kill him. Ki-Chul is not dead but is going to leave Hong Kong. Aryong, after becoming the new boss, succeeding her father, is advised by her father's right-hand man not to let him leave, as did her father who let her mother leave and then regretted it all his life.

Ojigi launched four military incursions against the Kingdom of Dahomey after the receiving requests for assistance from other kingdoms who were threatened by Agaja, the Dahomean king. In 1730 the Dahomeans agreed to begin paying an annual tribute of forty men, women, guns, and four hundred loads of cowries and corals to Oyo.

Milhollin and the Wisconsin Project are best known for digging up the details of dangerous nuclear deals and publishing them in the media. Their purpose has been to discourage such deals through public embarrassment. Career Milhollin's work has been covered by a number of media profiles.

Milhollin's study on this secret export, together with his op-eds in the Norwegian and American press, forced Israel to return half of the heavy water to Norway and brought Norway to abandon its nuclear export business.Gary Milhollin, \\"Israel‚Äôs Reactor in Full Swing ‚Äì With Norwegian Heavy Water ,\\" Aftenposten, July 6, 1989, p. 5.\\"Israel‚Äôs A-Bombs and Norway‚Äôs Heavy Water: The Steps to Revelation ,\\" Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, April 1990. In the 1990s Milhollin and the Wisconsin Project continued to advocate for stronger controls on dangerous exports. In July 1990, Milhollin and the Project revealed in The Washington Post that the Western countries were dropping export controls on items that Iraq was using to build nuclear weapons and missiles.Gary Milhollin, \\"Attention, Nuke-Mart Shoppers! \\" Washington Post, July 22, 1990, p. C2. The revelations triggered steps by the United States and its allies to recontrol many of the items.\\"Achievements ,\\" Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control. Similar revelations continued throughout the 1990s. In 1995, an article in The New York Times revealed that China was the source of poison gas ingredients being smuggled to Iran and that the United States planned to free for export supercomputers that the Pentagon was using to develop the next generation of American weapons.Gary Milhollin and Meg Dennison, \\"China‚Äôs Cynical Calculation ,\\" New York Times, April 24, 1995, p.

A11. which led Congress to strengthen controls on supercomputer exports. And in 1998, after India and Pakistan tested nuclear weapons in May of that year, the U.S. government used data that Milhollin and the Project had compiled to sanction 63 organizations linked to those countries' nuclear and missile programs.Gary Milhollin, \\"Made in America? \\" Washington Post, June 7, 1998, p.

Throughout his career, he won domestic titles with Italian club Juventus, both as a player and as a manager. At international level, he took part at the 1950 FIFA World Cup with the Italy national football team. Career Carlo Parola executing his signature bicycle kick in a match between Juventus and Fiorentina. Parola is mostly known for his time with Juventus with whom he played over 300 games between 1939 and 1954, winning two Serie A titles and a Coppa Italia, and even serving as the club's captain from 1949 onwards. He also had brief spells with Lazio and Midland in Argentina, before going into management. At international level, he was capped for Italy on 10 occasions between 1945 and 1950, and represented his country at the 1950 FIFA World Cup. As a coach, he managed several Italian clubs throughout his career, and had spells with Anconitana, Juventus, Livorno, and Novara. He won the Serie A title during his second spell as Juventus's coach in 1975, a title he had previously also won as a player for the club. Style of play A quick, mobile, hard-working, versatile, and powerful player, with good technique, Parola was capable of playing both as a defender and as a defensive midfielder, due to his strength, stamina, and man-marking, which led him to be regarded as one of Italy's greatest defenders. Under his manager Felice Borel in the WM system, known as sistema in Italy, he often played as a centre-half-back, a position which was known as the centromediano metodista role in Italian football jargon, due to its association with the metodo system. In this position, he was given both defensive and creative duties, functioning as both a ball‚Äìwinner who was tasked with retreating into defence to mark opposing forwards, and also as a deep-lying playmaker after winning back the ball, a position which led to the development of the sweeper, or libero role. He was also capable of playing as a man‚Äìmarking centre-back, or stopper, and as a full-back. He was also known to be fair player, although because of this, some in the sport accused him of not being aggressive or tenacious enough in his tackling; as such, manager Vittorio Pozzo often preferred to use Mario Rigamonti in the holding midfield role with the Italian national team. An agile and athletic player, in addition to his defensive skills, he was also known for his skill in the air, and ability to score goals with acrobatic strikes, from volleys and bicycle kicks, having played as a forward in his youth; indeed, during the 1940s, he popularised the use of the bicycle kick in Italy, earning the nickname Signor Rovesciata (\\"Mr. Overhead Kick\\"), and was even credited with its invention by the Italians.See:  As a youngster, Parola also played in several other positions, including the roles of goalkeeper, winger, and centre-forward. Legacy Known for his acrobatic volleys and spectacular overhead kicks, a famous picture of Parola executing a bicycle kick was adopted as the logo of Panini Group.

Eigenmann & R. S. Eigenmann, 1888) (Talking catfish) Appearance and anatomy These catfish lack scales, but their bodies are armored with a lateral row of bony plates. The head is large and flattened. The mouth is terminal (points straight forward). There are three pairs of barbels and the eyes are small. There are no external sexual characteristics. The dorsal and pectoral fin spines are stiff and sharp and can inflict a painful wound. In the aquarium Acanthodoras species may be kept as pet fish in the aquarium fish hobby. They will accept a wide variety of foods. Due to their behavior of digging through the substrate for their food, sand or round gravel should be used to prevent damage to their barbels. There should be some shelter for these fish to hide under; once released into the aquarium, these fish may virtually never be seen again. This fish species is a peaceful, community resident. Breeding has been achieved in captivity. The parents were observed digging a depression in the substrate into which the eggs were deposited. The eggs were guarded by both fish. The eggs hatched after 4‚Äì5 days although unfortunately the young did not survive beyond the fry stage of development. A. spinosissimus is similar to Platydoras cataphractus. These fish shun bright light and should be provided with adequate hiding places. This fish may live in an aquarium for months without being seen, hiding below rocks and burying itself in the substrate.

It was recorded at the 1991 Montreux Jazz Festival and released by Warner Bros. Records in 1993. Miles & Quincy: Live at Montreux charted at number one on the Billboard Top Jazz Albums. It won Davis his seventh Grammy Award for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Performance.  Background  Miles Davis, who had never revisited past music from his career before, surprised jazz fans when he worked with an ensemble led by Quincy Jones at the Montreux Jazz Festival on July 8, 1991. Jones developed the idea of using two orchestras and conducted both the Gil Evans Orchestra and George Gruntz Concert Jazz Band at the concert. The performance also featured guest instrumentalists who played with Davis, including trumpeters Benny Bailey and Wallace Roney, drummer Grady Tate, bassist Carles Benavent, and alto saxophonist Kenny Garrett. Davis was seriously ill when he played the concert, and it was the final album he recorded before his death three months later.  Critical reception  In a contemporary review for Entertainment Weekly, critic David Hajdu gave the album an \\"A\\" and said that it is \\"simply the most exquisite music of tragedy this side of a New Orleans funeral. Don't be mistaken though: This ain't no party. Nor is it a career-summing work of miraculous late-life virtuosity. It's something even rarer: an almost unbearably honest musical expression, without apology or shame, of weakness, age, and pain.\\" Q magazine found the sound thin, but funky and strong. In a less enthusiastic review for Vibe magazine, Greg Tate found Davis' playing occasionally sketchy and felt that the recreations are not on-par with Evans' original arrangements: \\"[T]he compressed nature of this document‚Äîeven its shadowy relationship to the original‚Äîonly serves to highlight the nova-like luminosity of Gil and Miles's work together.\\" In a retrospective review, Allmusic's Ron Wynn wrote that \\"not every moment is golden, but the overall session ranks just a bit below the majestic '50s and '60s dates featuring Davis' trumpet and Evans' arrangements.\\" In The Penguin Guide to Jazz, Richard Cook and Brian Morton said that the exaggerated arrangements are redeemed by the audience's enraptured reception and Davis' musical ideas, if not his labored solos: \\"Jones hails Miles Davis as a 'great painter' and that is exactly what he was. He left some masterpieces, some puzzling abstracts, and a pile of fascinating sketches.\\"  Track listing  # Introduction by Claude Nobs & Quincy Jones # \\"Boplicity\\" # Introduction to Miles Ahead Medley # \\"Springsville\\" # \\"Maids of Cadiz\\" # \\"The Duke\\" # \\"My Ship\\" # \\"Miles Ahead\\" # \\"Blues For Pablo\\" # Introduction to Porgy and Bess Medley # \\"Orgone\\" # \\"Gone, Gone, Gone\\" # \\"Summertime\\" # \\"Here Come De Honey Man\\" # \\"The Pan Piper\\" # \\"Solea\\"  Personnel  * Miles Davis - trumpet * Kenny Garrett - alto saxophone * The George Gruntz Concert Jazz Band ‚Äì performer * The Gil Evans Orchestra ‚Äì performer * Quincy Jones - conductor, producer * Wallace Roney - trumpet, flugelhorn *Ack Van Rooyen - trumpet, flugelhorn ** The Gil Evans Orchestra *** Lew Soloff - trumpet *** Miles Evans - trumpet *** Tom Malone - trombone *** Alex Foster - alto and soprano saxophones, flute *** George Adams - tenor saxophone, flute *** Gil Goldstein - keyboards *** Delmar Brown - keyboards *** Kenwood Dennard - drums, percussion ** The George Gruntz Concert Jazz Band *** Marvin Stamm - trumpet, flugelhorn *** John D‚ÄôEarth - trumpet, flugelhorn *** Jack Walrath - trumpet, flugelhorn *** John Clark - French horn *** Tom Varner - French horn *** Dave Bargeron - euphonium, trombone *** Earl McIntyre - euphonium, trombone *** Dave Taylor - bass trombone *** Howard Johnson - tuba, baritone saxophone *** Sal Giorgianni - alto saxophone *** Bob Malach - tenor saxophone, flute, clarinet *** Larry Schneider - tenor saxophone, oboe, flute, clarinet *** Jerry Bergonzi - tenor saxophone *** George Gruntz -piano *** Mike Richmond - double bass *** John Riley - drums, percussion ** Additional musicians George Gruntz Concert Jazz Band *** Manfred Schoof - trumpet, flugelhorn *** Ack van Royen - trumpet, flugelhorn *** Alex Brofsky - French horn *** Roland Dahinden - trombone *** Claudio Pontiggia - French horn *** Anne O‚ÄôBrien - flute *** Julian Cawdry - flute *** Hanspeter Frehner - flute *** Michel Weber - clarinet *** Christian Gavillet - bass clarinet, baritone saxophone *** Tilman Zahn - oboe *** Dave Seghezzo - oboe *** Xavier Duss - oboe *** Judith Wenziker - oboe *** Christian Raabe - bassoon *** Reiner Erb - bassoon *** Xenia Schindler - harp *** Conrad Herwig - trombone *** Roger Rosenberg - bass clarinet, baritone saxophone ** Additional musicians *** Benny Bailey - trumpet, flugelhorn *** Carles Benavent - double bass, E-Bass *** Grady Tate - drums  Charts  {class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\"  |- !scope=\\"col\\"|Chart (1993) !scope=\\"col\\"|Peak position |- !scope=\\"row\\"|U.S. Top Jazz Albums (Billboard) |1 |- !scope=\\"row\\"|U.S. Top R&B; Albums (Billboard) |86 |} Certifications and sales  See also  * The Complete Miles Davis at Montreux * Miles!

Highlights of the orchestra's repertoire include ongoing cycles of the orchestral works of Beethoven and Mahler, as well as major works by Elgar, Mozart, Hindemith, Rachmaninoff and Dvo≈ô√°k. The orchestra has also presented world-premieres of works by composers including Emily Doolittle, John McKinnon, Leandro Espinosa, Margaret Mayer and the film-composer Christopher Thomas. History The Oregon East Symphony was created in 1986 by a consortium of local musicians and music lovers who wanted to establish a community orchestra in Pendleton, Oregon. Pendleton, population 17,310, is over 200 miles from the nearest metropolitan area. General information The Oregon East Symphony and Chorale offer a subscription series of five classical concerts and perform a yearly Holiday Concert, which often features other local ensembles. In 2001, the OES founded a new training orchestra, the A Sharp Players. The orchestra's primary home is the Vert Auditorium. Youth Programs Playing for Keeps is a unique and comprehensive music education project, which was initiated in 2001 by the Oregon East Symphony Board of Directors. The Goals of the project are: ¬∑ To help rural young people gain access to new cultural opportunities. ¬∑ To forge new alliances between the OES and local school districts. ¬∑ To give young people who cannot afford musical instruction and/or instruments a chance to participate in music lessons, rehearsal and performance. ¬∑ To develop a new awareness concerning the role of a community orchestra and chorus in the cultural health of Eastern Oregon. Many projects make up the Playing for Keeps program: * Raising the Bar Players This program is open by audition to advanced-level high school string players and allows them to perform alongside the Oregon East Symphony for certain performances. The program is headed by the orchestra's principal cellist Zach Banks, while occasionally being directed by the principle conductor Beau Benson. * A-Sharp Players This preparatory orchestra is open to mid-level musicians of any age and gives them the opportunity to experience performing with a large ensemble. The program was directed by Bruce Walker, assistant conductor of the Oregon East Symphony until 2018, who was then replaced by Zach Banks, principal cellist of the Oregon East Symphony. * Preludes The Preludes string orchestra is open to beginning to intermediate string musicians of any age who can read music. Melinda Tovey, a first violinist in the orchestra, directs this group. * Music Lesson and Instrument Scholarships Students are supported in the study of their chosen instrument through a fund that helps with the cost of music lessons and instrument rental. * Musician Scholarships Young people who perform with the Symphony or Chorale are provided with stipends and travel costs for each concert that they participate in. This allows them to pursue their musical studies instead of having to hold down part-time jobs. * Young Artists Competition A professional review panel conducts competitive auditions for young musicians in the region. Winners of this competition are invited to perform with the Symphony as a featured soloist. * Family and Young People‚Äôs Concerts This annual concert features the winners of the Symphony‚Äôs Young Artists Competition and offers a youth- oriented concert program. The concert is also performed again twice during a weekday for school groups from the area. * Tickets for Kids During each school year, the OES distributes free regular season concert tickets to area youth throughout the school system. Oregon East Symphony Chorale From early on, the OES organization included a volunteer symphony chorus. From 1985-1999, the chorale was directed by Lee Friese. During the tenure of Kenneth Woods, the choir has been directed by Woods and a number of guest conductors and chorus masters, including Cyril Myers, Randal Thomas, Cheryl Carlson, Michael Frasier, and William Mayclin. Chorale highlights of recent years include performances of Dvorak's Stabat Mater, Mahler's Symphony no. 2, Beethoven's Symphony no. 9, Mozart's C Minor Mass, the Bach Christmas Oratorio and Bizet's Carmens. The chorale also performs on the annual holiday concerts, where it often focuses on light, seasonal repertoire under the direction of the chorus master.

Biography Early life Lino was born in a house on West Eight Street in Gravesend, Brooklyn, New York City. The marriage of his mobster father Robert A. Lino, Sr. and his mother was arranged by Genovese crime family patriarch and founder Vito Genovese during the 1930s. Frank attended Brooklyn's Lafayette High School but dropped out in tenth grade. His father died in 1989, according to what Michael DiLeonardo said during testimony against John A. Gotti. Almost every male member of his family was involved in La Cosa Nostra. After dropping out of high school in the 1950s he joined a violent street gang called the \\"Avenue U Boys\\". As a member of the \\"Avenue U Boys\\" Lino was involved in robberies. Lino first became associated with the La Cosa Nostra at the age of seventeen, and operated the local floating card games controlled by a Genovese crime family made soldier. He was a close business associate of Rosario Gangi. His cousin Edward Lino and brother Robert A. Lino, Jr. are both capos in the Gambino crime family. He is the father of successful New York City Wall Street stockbroker Michael, and father of Joseph, who became a made member of the Bonanno family. He is cousin-in-law to Grace Ann Scala-Lino, the sister of Gambino crime family capo Salvatore Scala and father of Colombo crime family mob associate Robert X. Grace Ann Lino was a customer of drug dealer Michael (Mikey Bear) Aiello. Frank was enraged over Aiello selling drugs to her and arranged for his murder, which he was supposed to witness, but the murder attempt was botched. He is the father of two sons, one Joseph Lino born c. 1961 who became a made member of the Bonanno family and Michael Lino. He is a son-in-law to Genovese crime family mob associates Francis Consalvo and Carmine Consalvo and distant uncle to Louis Consalvo. He is a first cousin of Bonanno family capo Robert Lino, Sr. and a paternal uncle of Bonanno crime family capo Robert A. Lino, Jr. He is the godfather to Michael Lino and Frank Coppa, Jr., the sons of former Bonanno family capo and childhood friend Frank Coppa. He is a cousin-in-law to Gambino crime family capo Salvatore Scala. He is a close friend of the New York Mets pitcher John Franco and an avid baseball fan. Frank had dark brown hair, and a round face with a ruddy complexion and later a bald head that \\"looked like a dirty tennis ball\\". He had a toothy smile and droopy eyes that were set too close together. Frank was a no-show school bus driver for the Local 1181 of the Amalgamated Transit Union and employed by a mob-owned bus company Atlantic Express Transportation Corporation in located at 7 North Street in Port Richmond, Staten Island which is still in operation. He became a made man of the Bonanno crime family on October 30, 1977, on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, Manhattan at his capo Alphonse \\"Sonny Red\\" Indelicato's apartment. It was his 40th birthday. As he grew older Frank became more and more obese. He gained a tremendous amount of weight and began to suffer from high blood pressure. During his 40-year career in organized crime he was under the Genovese family in 1956, switched to the Colombo crime family in 1962 and switched to the Gambino family in 1969 before in 1977 his friend Frank Coppa helped him join the Bonanno crime family. Lino and four other people including Jerry Rosenberg took part in the robbery of Borough Park Tobacco Company in Brooklyn on May 18, 1962. The robbery was unsuccessful and resulted in the death of two police officers, 56-year-old Detective Luke Joseph Fallon (who was an 26-year-veteran with the NYPD) and 29-year-old Detective John Patrick \\"Big\\" Finnegan (who was a seven-year- veteran with the NYPD) from the 70th Detective Squad. The three capos murder Frank had done everything from selling illegal pornography to running pump and dump schemes on Wall Street. Over the years he had been a loanshark, bookmaker, drug trafficker and contract killer for which he took part in the gangland slayings of six men including his cousin's drug dealer Michael \\"The Bear\\" Aiello and the notorious murders of Bonanno captains Alphonse Indelicato, Dominick Trinchera and Philip Giaccone. On May 5, 1981, Massino loyalists shot and killed Giaccone, Trinchera, and Indelicato in a Brooklyn night club. On the pretext of working out a peace agreement, Massino had invited them to meet with him at the 20/20 Night Club in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. However, Massino's real plan was to assassinate the capos. The ambush was set in the club store room, with Salvatore Vitale and three other gunmen wearing ski masks hiding in a closet. One of the gunmen was mobster Vito Rizzuto, who came from Montreal, Quebec, Canada with another Canadian mobster to help Massino.\\"Aftermath of a Hit\\" by David Amoruso Gangsters Inc. May 8, 2007 Massino told the men to avoid shooting so that bullets wouldn't spray around the room. Massino also brought drop cloths and ropes for disposing of the bodies afterwards. When the capos arrived at the 20/20, Massino and Bonanno mobster Gerlando Sciascia and Lino escorted them to the store room. As the men entered the room, Sciascia brushed his hand through his hair, giving the prearranged signal. Vitale and gunmen rushed out of the closet, with Rizzuto yelling \\"it's a hold-up\\". Massino immediately punched Giaccone, knocking him to the floor, and also stopping Indelicato from escaping. Giaconne got up and tried to run out of the room, but was blocked up against a wall with Trinchera. The gunmen killed Giaccone with a volley of submachine gun fire. The three capos were unarmed, as was the rule when attending a peace meeting. Lino, who had escaped, was brought instead of Indelicato's son, but was quickly won over to Massino's side.Raab, p. 615 After the killings, the Bonanno gunmen transported the three bodies to a lot in Lindenwood, Queens, in an area known as The Hole. The lot was a Gambino mob graveyard; Gambino crime family capo John Gotti arranged for his men to bury the bodies there as a favor to Massino.\\"Bloody B'klyn Rubout: Says Massino OKd '81 mob hit\\" by John Marzulli, New York Daily News June 30, 2004\\"In Court, Evidence Suggests Gotti Associates Buried Victims in Lot\\" by William K. Rashbaum The New York Times October 9, 2004 A few weeks later, on May 28, authorities discovered Indelicato's body and removed it from the lot. In October 2004, after some children reported finding a body in the Lindenwood lot, FBI agents excavated the property and discovered the bodies of Giaccone and Trinchera. Among the personal items they unearthed was a Piaget watch that had belonged to Giaccone's wife.\\"Skeletal Remains Are Believed To Be Those of Mob Captains\\" by William K.

He received two life sentences in prison.Bonanno crime boss is sentenced to two life terms\\" by Robert F. Worth New York Times June 24, 2005 On May 4, 2007, after being extradited to the United States, Rizzuto pleaded guilty in a Brooklyn court to reduced charges in the murder of three capos and was sentenced to ten years in state prison.Rizzuto pleads guilty to racketeering charge , National Post, May 5, 2007Mob boss admits role in massacre, National Post, May 5, 2007Timeline: Vito Rizzuto's run-ins with the law , The Montreal Gazette, May 4, 2007 Informant In September 1999, Lino began serving a 57-month sentence in prison.https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-106hhrg67115/pdf/CHRG-106hhrg67115.pdf In 2003, Lino was arrested along with Massino, underboss Salvatore Vitale, and fellow capo Daniel Mongelli on a sweeping RICO indictment. A few days after the arrests, Vitale turned informer after learning that Massino had put a contract on him.Raab, pp. 674-675. Vitale's decision to flip unnerved Lino. While he was charged with Sonny Black's murder, that charge was initially based solely on the word of former Bonanno soldier Frank Coppa. However, Vitale could not only corroborate Coppa's testimony, but could also implicate him in three other murders. Lino quickly realized that Vitale's testimony could potentially send him to prison for life. When the Bonnano defense team told Massino and Lino about Vitale's defection, Lino recalled thinking, \\"This meeting is a funeral and I'm dead.\\" He secretly got word to prosecutors that he was willing to flip as well, though he feared Massino could order his children and grandchildren killed if word got out. After 81 days in solitary confinement for his own protection, Lino formally agreed to become an informant. As part of the deal, he revealed everyone he knew was either a made man or an associate‚Äîincluding his own son.Raab, pp. 675-676. Lino's testimony implicated Massino in four homicides and featured the first full eyewitness account of the murder of the three captains.

The mine also has an anti-handling device which triggers the mine if it is moved. The mine's warhead is a shaped charge design containing approximately 700 grams of RDX. The manufacturer claims that it is capable of penetrating 60 millimeters of armour at an offset of half a meter. The mine can be deployed either from aircraft, a specialised mine laying system or 122 mm artillery rockets. When required the mine is ejected from a storage canister, and shortly afterwards a small parachute is opened, which both retards the descent and keeps the mine correctly oriented as it descends. Once the mine lands on the ground the top of the mine is ejected, along with the parachute and the spring-loaded legs bring the mine upright.

In order to run Haml code, files need to have .haml extension. These files are similar to .erb or eRuby files which also help to embed Ruby code while developing a web application. While parsing coding comments, Haml uses the same rules as Ruby 1.9 or later. Haml understands only ASCII compatible encodings like UTF-8 but not UTF-16 or UTF-32 because these are not compatible with ASCII. Haml can be used in command line, as a separate Ruby module, or in a Ruby on Rails application making Haml suitable for a wide range of applications. History Haml was originally introduced by Hampton Catlin with its initial release in 2006 and his work was taken ahead by a few other people. His motive was to make HTML simpler, cleaner and easier to use. Since 2006, it has been revised several times and newer versions were released. Until 2012 Natalie Weizenbaum was the primary maintainer of Haml, followed by Norman Clarke until 2015. Natalie worked on making Haml usable in Ruby applications, while the branding and design was done by Nick Walsh. Others who are currently in the maintenance team are Matt Wildig, Akira Matsuda, Tee Parham and Takashi Kokubun. Version history Version 2.2.0 was released in July 2009 with support for Ruby 1.9 and Rails 2.0 or above. Version 3.0.0 was released in May 2010, adding support for Rails 3 and some performance improvements. The fourth major version broke compatibility with previous versions, only supporting Rails 3 and Ruby 1.8.7 or above, and marked the switch to semantic versioning. Several amendments like increasing the performance, fixing a few warnings, compatibility with latest versions of Rails, fixes in the documentation and many more were made in the Haml 4 series. Version 5.0.0 was released in April 2017. It supports Ruby 2.0.0 or above and drops compatibility with Rails 3. A 'trace' option, which helps users to perform tracing on Haml template, has been added. Features Four principles were involved in development of Haml. User-friendly markup Markup language is user-friendly if it adheres to following features: * Easy to understand the language * Easy of use (Implementation) DRY Markup language should adhere to the Don't repeat yourself (DRY) principle. It should: * Avoid unnecessary repetitions * Focus on clean code Well-indented Markup language with good indentation improves appearance, makes it easy to read for readers and also to determine where a given element starts and ends. Clear structure Markup language with a clear structure will help in code maintenance and logical understanding of final result. It is unclear whether Haml offers any differential advantage in this regard. Examples Haml markup is similar to CSS in syntax. For example, Haml has the same dot \`.\` representation for classes as CSS does, making it easy for developers to use this markup. \\"Hello, World!\\" Haml as a command-line tool The following are equivalent as HAML recognises CSS selectors: %p{:class => \\"sample\\", :id => \\"welcome\\"} Hello, World! %p.sample#welcome Hello, World! These render to the following HTML code: Hello, World! Haml as an add-on for Ruby on Rails To use Haml with Ruby, the Ruby \`Gemfile\` should include this line: gem 'haml' Similar to eRuby, Haml also can access local variables (declared within same file in Ruby code). This example uses a sample Ruby controller file. * file: \`app/controllers/messages_controller.rb\` class MessagesController < ApplicationController def index @message = \\"Hello, World!\\" end end * file: \`app/views/messages/index.html.haml\` #welcome %p= @message This renders to: Hello, World! Haml as a Ruby module To use Haml independent of Rails and ActionView, install \`haml\` gem, include it in \`Gemfile\` and simply import \`[Usage: require 'haml']\` it in Ruby script or invoke Ruby interpreter with \`-rubygems\` flag. welcome = Haml::Engine.new(\\"%p Hello, World!\\") welcome.render Output: Hello, World! Haml::Engine is a Haml class. Basic example Haml uses whitespace indentation (two spaces) for tag nesting and scope. This acts as a replacement for the open-end tag pairs, making it DRY and cleaner. The following example compares the syntaxes of Haml and eRuby (Embedded Ruby), alongside the HTML output. {! Haml ! ERB ! HTML |-valign=\\"top\\" %div.category %div.recipes %h1= recipe.name %h3= recipe.category %div %h4= recipe.description # <%= recipe.name %> ### <%= recipe.category %> #### <%= recipe.description %> # Cookie ### Desserts #### Made from dough and sugar. Usually circular in shape and has about 400 calories. |} **Key differences are:* Haml doesn't have both start and end for each element like eRuby * eRuby syntax looks a lot like HTML and is thereby more HTML-like while Haml is more CSS-like. * Haml uses indentation to nest tag elements whereas eRuby uses the same HTML representation * In Haml properties like \`class\`, \`id\` can be represented by \`.\`, \`#\` respectively instead of regular \`class\` and \`id\` keywords. Haml also uses \`%\` to indicate a HTML element instead of \`<>\` as in eRuby. Example with embedded Ruby code Note: This is a simple preview example and may not reflect the current version of the language. !!! %html{ :xmlns => \\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\\", :lang => \\"en\\", \\"xml:lang\\" => \\"en\\"} %head %title BoBlog %meta{\\"http-equiv\\" => \\"Content-Type\\", :content => \\"text/html; charset=utf-8\\"} %link{\\"rel\\" => \\"stylesheet\\", \\"href\\" => \\"main.css\\", \\"type\\" => \\"text/css\\"} %body #header %h1 BoBlog %h2 Bob's Blog #content \\\\- @entries.each do |entry.entry %h3.title= entry.title %p.date= entry.posted.strftime(\\"%A, %B %d, %Y\\") %p.body= entry.body #footer %p All content copyright ¬© Bob The above Haml would produce this XHTML: # BoBlog ## Bob's Blog ### Halloween Tuesday, October 31, 2006 Happy Halloween, glorious readers!

He is also a guest writer for wrestling websites such as Wrestling-News.com, most notably his \\"Reil World\\" and \\"Billy Reil Uncut\\" columns. Reil is always a classically trained actor, having starred in films such as \\"Purgatory\\" and \\"The Pit\\". Career Early life and career Born in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Reil was a wrestling fan growing up and often attended World Wrestling Federation events at The Spectrum during the late 1980s. As a teenager, he began hanging out at the ECW Arena attempting to make contacts in the professional wrestling business and eventually met Angel Orsini, who then introduced Reil to Reckless Youth. He soon made his in-ring debut on May 19, 1995 in a match against his childhood friend Trent Acid. During the summer of 1996, Reil began training with The Pit Bulls before leaving for college the following year. In 1997, he was given a 4-day scholarship to Penn State University for his athletic skills on the baseball diamond. While at Penn State, Reil continued to wrestle outside the university. Unfortunately, his baseball career was cut short when he was released for pitching an ERA of 16.3. Jersey All Pro Wrestling and the independents Reil continued to wrestle and was honing his craft working in Jersey All Pro Wrestling, the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) New Jersey territory, and Grande Wrestling Alliance. He would team with Trent Acid to defeat Homicide and Kane D for the JAPW Tag Team titles in Bayonne, New Jersey on January 29. The two would defend the titles for a month before losing the titles to Dave Desire and Rick Silver on February 26, 1999. Reil attended Dory Funk, Jr.'s Dojo in 1999.

The educational transformation of Kerala was triggered by efforts of the Church Mission Society missionaries, who were the pioneers that promoted mass education in Kerala, in the early decades of the 19th century. The local dynastic precursors of modern-day Kerala‚Äîprimarily the Travancore Royal Family, the Nair Service Society, Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam (SNDP Yogam) and Muslim Educational Society (MES)‚Äîalso made significant contributions to the progress on education in Kerala. There were many sabha mathams that imparted Vedic knowledge. Apart from kalaris, which taught martial arts, there were village schools run by Ezhuthachans or Asians. Christian missionaries brought the modern school education system to Kerala. Education in Kerala had been promoted during British rule in India by Christian missionaries who were keen on providing education to all sections of society and on strengthening of women, without any kind of discrimination. The contributions of Catholic priests and nuns has been crucial and has played a major role in the education of women and members of lower strata of society, resulting in the surpassing of many social hurdles. A significant figure in the 19th century was Rev.fr. Kuriakose Elias Chavara, who started a system called \\"A school along with every church\\" to make education available for both poor and rich. That system still continues in the present. His work has resulted in the promotion of education for girls and has become a model for the educational system in Kerala after independence. Kerala's high literacy rate is attributed to a high literacy rate among girls; as it is said, \\"When a woman is educated, she will make sure that her children are well-educated.\\" The Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics was founded by Madhava of Sangamagrama in Kerala, which included among its members: Parameshvara, Neelakanta Somayaji, Jyeshtadeva, Achyuta Pisharati, Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri and Achyuta Panikkar. The school flourished between the 14th and 16th centuries and the original discoveries of the school seems to have ended with Narayana Bhattathiri (1559‚Äì1632). In attempting to solve astronomical problems, the Kerala school independently created a number of important mathematics concepts. Their most important results‚Äîseries expansion for trigonometric functions‚Äîwere described in Sanskrit verse in a book by Neelakanta called Tantrasangraha, and again in a commentary on this work, called Tantrasangraha-vakhya, of unknown authorship. The theorems were stated without proof, but proofs for the series for sine, cosine, and inverse tangent were provided a century later in the work YuktibhƒÅ·π£ƒÅ (c.1500‚Äì1610), written in Malayalam, by Jyesthadeva, and also in a commentary on Tantrasangraha. Their work, completed two centuries before the invention of calculus in Europe, provided what is now considered the first example of a power series (apart from geometric series). However, they did not formulate a systematic theory of differentiation and integration, nor is there any direct evidence of their results being transmitted outside Kerala.  Present  Schools and colleges are mostly run by the government, private trusts, or individuals. Each school is affiliated with either the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE), the Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE), Kerala State Education Board or the (NIOS). English is the language of instruction in most private schools, while government run schools offer English or Malayalam as the medium of instruction. Government-run schools in the districts bordering Karnataka and Tamil Nadu also offer instruction in Kannada or Tamil languages. A handful of Government Sanskrit Schools provide instruction in Sanskrit supplemented by Malayalam, English, Tamil or Kannada. After 10 years of secondary schooling, students typically enroll at Higher Secondary School in one of the three streams‚Äîliberal arts, commerce or science. Upon completing the required coursework, students can enroll in general or professional degree programmes. Kerala topped the Education Development Index (EDI) among 21 major states in India in year 2006‚Äì2007. In January 2016, Kerala became the 1st Indian state to achieve 100% primary education through its literacy programme Athulyam.  Quality of education  In spite of the large number of educational institutions in the state, the quality of education at all levels in Kerala has been showing a decline due to financial constraints resulting from a quantitative expansion of the sector. A study published in 1999 by the Centre for Socio-economic & Environmental Studies states that while the dropout rates are very low in primary schools, the same increases in the ninth and the tenth standards in Kerala. This is particularly true of SC/ST students. Schools showed that only 73% of the students joining at 1st Standard reach the 10th Standard. In the case of scheduled caste students, only 59% reach the 10th standard. 60% of Scheduled Tribe students drop out by the 10th standard. Another major indicator of the inefficiency of Kerala's school education system is the large-scale failure of the students in the matriculation examination. Only about 50% of the students who appear for the examination get through. The percentage has been considerably increased because of major interventions by the government in the areas of curriculum and teacher training. In March 2011, 91.37% students qualified for higher studies in the matriculation Examination. The grades in SSLC examination plays an important role in the admission procedure to colleges in Kerala.SSLC Exam Results  Organisation  The schools and colleges in Kerala are run by the government or private trusts and individuals. Each school is affiliated with either the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE), the Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE), Kerala State Education Board or the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS), though some schools in the state do offer Cambridge International Examination's IGCSE curriculum. English is the language of instruction in most private schools, but government-run schools offer both English and Malayalam as medium. After 10 years of secondary schooling, students typically enroll at Higher Secondary School in one of the three streams‚Äîliberal arts, commerce or science. Upon completing the required coursework, students can enroll in general or professional degree programmes. Lots of civil service institutes are there.

National Route 1A crosses it as it traverses the Ho√†nh S∆°n, a side-spur of the larger Annamite Range. The pass is 2,560 m long, ascending to the height of 250 m (750 ft). Historical French texts refer to the pass as Porte d'Annam. History It marked the former boundary of Champa and Dai Viet until the 15th century when the Vietnamese pushed south and conquered the Cham lands piecemeal. Controlling the strategic pass was a priority through the ages as the narrow neck of land could be choked off. At the summit of Ngang Pass remains the Ho√†nh S∆°n Quan (Transverse Mountain Gate), a masonry gateway built by Vietnam's last dynasty, the Nguy·ªÖn to regulate the foot traffic across the mountain. The scenic pass is also well known in Vietnamese literature, its beauty having been sung by many writers, perhaps the most well-known is the poem by B√† Huy·ªán Thanh Quan. 20th century The pass was once a major hindrance to land transportation with its winding and steep grade. A modern tunnel has since bypassed the climb, shortening the driving time through the pass as well as making it safer for drivers. The serpentine road ascending the pass is now used by sightseers only.

The town continued to grow through the 1850s and 1860s with the construction of churches, hotels and schools. In 1870, the courthouse was moved from Digby to Merino. The Merino co-operative butter factory was established around 1885. After World War I, the area was opened up for soldier settlement. In 1955 Merino was connected to the electricity grid.

The album builds upon the roots music foundation that Lanegan had established with his debut The Winding Sheet. Released during the grunge explosion of the early 1990s, Whiskey for The Holy Ghost showcases Lanegan's growing maturity as a songwriter and vocalist. Recording The recording was reportedly a frustrating affair for Lanegan; at one point the singer had to be physically prevented from throwing the master tapes into a river by producer Jack Endino. In his 2017 book I Am the Wolf: Lyrics and Writings, the singer recalls: In an interview on WTF with Marc Maron, Lanegan highlighted the making of Whiskey for the Holy Ghost as an instance in his life where his drug use had a positive effect artistically: \\"Around the time I did my second solo record I decided to smoke weed, and it made me do some stuff that I never had thought about doing ‚Äì but of course it turned on me, like all drugs.\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9DtWodeCas&t;=76m0s Despite the album's slow gestation and Lanegan's notorious substance abuse problems, the songs on Whiskey for The Holy Ghost sound remarkably cohesive. Lyrically, Lanegan continues to delve into the darker side of the human experience on songs like \\"Borracho\\" and the Biblical \\"Pendulum.\\" (\\"Jesus Christ been here and gone, what a painful price to pay.\\") In his book I Am the Wolf, Lanegan states that Van Morrison and writer Cormac McCarthy sparked his imagination for the imagery on the album, with Morrison being a direct influence on \\"Carnival,\\" and admits that \\"Pendulum\\" started \\"as a joke designed to make my musical partner Mike Johnson laugh.\\" Dan Peters of Mudhoney plays drums on \\"Borracho\\" and \\"House A Home.\\" \\"House A Home\\" was released as a single with an accompanying video. \\"The River Rise\\" was used in the 1996 grunge documentary Hype!, where it accompanied a montage filmed at the vigil following Kurt Cobain's death. Reception Mark Deming of AllMusic writes, \\"The songs are more literate and better realized than on the debut, the arrangements are subtle and supportive (often eschewing electric guitars for keyboards and acoustic instruments), and Lanegan's voice, bathed in bourbon and nicotine, transforms the deep sorrow of the country blues (a clear inspiration for this music) into something new, compelling, and entirely his own.\\" Track listing All songs written by Mark Lanegan. # \\"The River Rise\\" ‚Äì 4:29 # \\"Borracho\\" ‚Äì 5:40 # \\"House a Home\\" ‚Äì 3:07 # \\"Kingdoms of Rain\\" ‚Äì 3:24 # \\"Carnival\\" ‚Äì 3:40 # \\"Riding the Nightingale\\" ‚Äì 6:17 # \\"El Sol\\" ‚Äì 3:42 # \\"Dead on You\\" ‚Äì 3:11 # \\"Shooting Gallery\\" ‚Äì 3:32 # \\"Sunrise\\" ‚Äì 2:55 # \\"Pendulum\\" ‚Äì 2:12 # \\"Judas Touch\\" ‚Äì 1:37 # \\"Beggar's Blues\\" ‚Äì 5:36 Personnel *Mark Lanegan: Vocals, acoustic and electric guitars *Mike Johnson: Bass, acoustic, electric and slide guitars, organ, piano, harmonica, backing vocals *Frank Cody: Piano and organ *Ted Trewhella: Piano *Justin Williams: Organ *Kurt Fedora: Bass *Phil Sparks: Bowed and upright bass *Dave Kreuger: Violin *Mike Stinette: Saxophone *Tad Doyle, J Mascis, Dan Peters, Mark Pickerel: Drums *Krisha Augerot, Sally Barry: Backing vocals Production *Produced by Mark Langegan and Mike Johnson *Recorded by John Agnello, Terry Date, Ed Brooks and Jack Endino *Mixed by John Agnello *Mastered by Bob Ludwig References External links * \\"House A Home\\" music video Category:1994 albums Category:Mark Lanegan albums Category:Sub Pop albums ","title":"Whiskey for the Holy Ghost"},{"id":"11674483","text":"Boy & Kris was a Philippine morning talk and lifestyle show of ABS-CBN premiered on July 2, 2007.

Originally the ship was the Austro-Hungarian 250t-class \\"F\\"-group torpedo boat SMS Tb 95-F. She was named for the ancient Greek city of Pergamon (today known as Bergama) located in Anatolia; the city was part of the territory awarded at the end of World War I in the Treaty of S√®vres to Greece for being on the Allied side. The ship, along with two sister ships of Fiume-class torpedo boats Panormos and Proussa was transferred to Greece as a war reparation from the Central Powers in 1919. Service in the Austro- Hungarian navy In the build-up to the First World War, Austria-Hungary ordered four 250‚Äìtonne boats to be built at the Ganz & Co.‚Äì Danubius shipyard in 1912/13. The Navy asked for several improvements compared with the Trieste‚Äìclass boats. Negotiations broke down in early December because of exaggerated prices requested by Danubius and were only resumed when pressured by the Hungarian Minister of Commerce. Danubius lowered its price by 10%. Finally Ganz & Co. ‚Äì Danubius got orders for 16 torpedoboats in 1913, despite the fact that original plans had called for the Naval Arsenal Pola to build the Tb 86 to Tb 100 series. These ‚ÄòFiume‚Äìboats‚Äô were commissioned under the numbers Tb 82 F to Tb 97 F between August, 1914 and August, 1916. They differed from their Trieste sister‚Äìships having two funnels and an extended forecastle. Service in the Hellenic navy Pergamos served in the Hellenic navy from 1919 until she was sunk during the German invasion of Greece on April 25, 1941.

County residents have expressed worry concerning the potential dangers of leasing a public park for an industrial purpose, citing an increase in truck traffic, air pollution, water pollution, decreased property value, and potential for catastrophic events, (e.g., an explosion), as possible hazards.

Plot summary Set mainly in ancient Ireland, the series covers four generations in the family of Sevenwaters, which enjoys a special relationship with the people of the Otherworld. As well as battles between the Irish Celts and the Britons, internal conflicts between neighbouring landholders are integral to the plots. However, all six books carry a strong romance element. All the books are narrated in the first person by young women of the family. Daughter of the Forest Daughter of the Forest is based loosely on \\"The Six Swans\\" (a story that has many versions, one of which is recounted by Hans Christian Andersen). A 13-year-old girl, Sorcha, (pronounced Sor-ka or sometimes Ser-ha) must sew six shirts from a painful nettle plant in order to save her brothers from a witch's enchantment. They have been turned into swans and can only be returned to their true forms if she creates a shirt for each brother with her own hands - and she must remain completely mute until the task is finished. Living in hiding, Sorcha must avoid discovery, survive off the land, and toil night and day to complete her task without the benefit of any tools of the trade, using only what the forest around her can provide--all while keeping silent and bearing unfathomable loneliness. Terrible events hinder her progress and eventually take her further and further away from her home. As months and even years pass by, Sorcha's lonely existence is only brightened by her hope of breaking the spell on her brothers....and a foreign man nicknamed 'Red'. Son of the Shadows Son of the Shadows is the story of Sorcha's younger daughter, Liadan (Lee-a-dan). Liadan is an exceptionally talented healer who is also supernaturally gifted; receiving sporadic visions of the present and future, able to hear and see beings of the Otherworld, and she has also inherited her mother's ability to communicate silently, mind-to-mind, with her twin brother Sean. While traveling through a small village, Liadan is taken by a pair of men belonging to a notorious band of outlaws. Despite a fearsome reputation, these strange warriors aren't abusive or even rude to her--all they want is for her to heal their friend, a wounded blacksmith. The outlaws respect her greatly--except for one, their Chief, the notorious \\"Painted Man\\". The fierce, tattooed leader is a mystery Liadan must unravel--who he is, where he comes from, why he cannot abide darkness, and why he despises women so much that he can't stand being in her presence. Guided by the Otherworld people known as Fair Folk, Liadan walks a long and twisted path that leads her all over the land of Erin, discovering shocking things about her family, her friends...and the Painted Man. She must separate truth from lies, and decide whether to follow the path the Fair Folk set for her, or make her own way, though her own path may lead to extreme danger, broken alliances and friendships, and a broken heart. Child of the Prophecy Child of the Prophecy is the story of Fainne (Faun-ya), the daughter of Niamh (Nee-av). She is raised on the coast in Kerry by her single father, a powerful sorcerer. Fainne has little time for normal childhood things, prevented by her father's lengthy lessons of practicing the craft; sorcery. What precious little time she does have, she spends with her only friend, Darragh (Darr-ah), a boy belonging to a family of travelers. As Fainne grows into a young woman, her heavy workload increases, leaving no time for anything but the practice of the craft. Her father has taught her well, but her education is not yet complete. Her grandmother, a renowned sorceress capable of awesome powers and terrifying cruelty, comes to finish her training--and to tell her the reason behind all these years of preparation. Fainne is to complete a task for her grandmother--go to her mother's home, to meet her family for the first time...and to kill her own cousin, destroying the family's chances of winning an impending battle and fulfilling an ancient prophecy. She can't refuse, or her evil grandmother will punish her by hurting those she loves--her father, her young cousins, and her most precious treasure of all; her childhood friend, Darragh. Fainne must walk a fine line between good and evil, and face an impossible choice: dance to the witch's tune in order to protect her loved ones, or defy her sorceress grandmother for the greater good of her family, the people of Sevenwaters, and ultimately all of Erin. Heir to Sevenwaters \\"Heir to Sevenwaters\\" is the story of Clodagh (Klo-da), daughter of Sean and Aisling (Ash-ling), an obedient, selfless, and caring young woman. Clodagh shares a psychic mind-link with her twin sister Deirdre (Dair-dra), just as her father, Sean, shares with his twin Liadan. Though Clodagh isn't gifted as a seer or with magical abilities, she is perceptive to the Otherworldly beings that share the forest around her home, sometimes seeing things others can't. Clodagh's twin is being wed to a young nobleman, and Sevenwaters is filled with visitors, including the handsome Aidan, and his best friend and foster-brother, Cathal (Ka-hall), both young men in her cousin's retinue. Aidan is the picture of a perfect future-husband; charming and caring, while Cathal is rude, insulting, and embarrassing to Aidan. Clodagh has other worries, however, with the prospect of parting with her twin sister, and her mother's unexpected and potentially dangerous pregnancy. While taking charge of the household in her mother's place, Clodagh discovers more and more about the two young guardsmen‚Äîand it turns out that neither one is as he seems. Trouble is brewing among the local nobility, and Clodagh struggles to make sense of some mysterious warnings she receives. After the birth of baby Finbar, everyone is relieved to see that mother and child are both healthy and safe‚Äîuntil the newborn disappears suddenly while Clodagh is babysitting him. It happened in a split second, and in the baby's place is a pile of sticks, leaves, branches, and pebbles, crudely shaped in a baby's form‚Äîuntil Clodagh sees that the twig-and-leaves child is much more than it appears to be. The problem is, only Clodagh can see it for what it is‚Äîa changeling. To make matters worse, her father doesn't know whom to trust anymore, as the mysterious Cathal also disappeared at the same time as the baby. While the Sevenwaters men-at-arms search fruitlessly for baby Finbar, Clodagh knows it's a waste of time. A changeling can only mean one thing: it must be brought back to its home in the Otherworld, where she must strike a bargain with the Fair Folk to retrieve her baby brother. On her way, she runs straight into Cathal. Clodagh has no other options; she must take whatever help she can get‚Äîand deep down, she can tell that Cathal is not behind the kidnapping. Together they embark on a perilous journey, compelled by powerful forces‚Äîand even more powerful feelings. Seer of Sevenwaters Seer of Sevenwaters follows Sibeal's (pronounced Shi-bail) last summer on Inis Eala before she makes her final vows to become a druid and live in the forest of Sevenwaters in quiet meditation and solitude. What was meant to be a peaceful visit is quickly transformed as a shipwreck on a nearby reef sends three survivors to the island, including a mysterious amnesiac who Sibeal finds herself caring for. Their lives change when, together, they must embark upon a journey of self-discovery that will lead them far away and closer to each other. Twixt Firelight and Water A short story about Lady Oonagh's other son, Conri. For assisting in the rescue of Ciaran, he is turned into a raven until a woman of Sevenwaters agrees to marry him. After decades as Ciaran's familiar, his story wins the sympathy of Padriac's daughter, the fierce Aisha who is visiting for the first time from norseland Xix√≥n. Ciaran performs the wedding, the curse is broken, and Conri returns to human form. Flame of Sevenwaters Flame follows Maeve, one of Lord Sean's daughters, on her return to Sevenwaters after ten years away at Harrowfield. Burned in a horrible accident as a child, Maeve is reluctant to return to the place of so many difficult memories and expectations. Yet upon her return, she finds herself in the middle of a strange struggle, the heart of which lies in the Otherworld. And only Maeve and her little brother Finbar have the ability to save their family, their clan, and perhaps all of Erin.

It traverses a spur of the larger Annamite Range that juts into the East Sea of Viet Nam, on the border of ƒê√† N·∫µng and Th·ª´a Thi√™n‚ÄìHu·∫ø Province, near B·∫°ch M√£ National Park. Its name refers to the mists that rise from the sea, reducing visibility. Historically, the pass was a physical division between the kingdoms of Champa and ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát. The twisting road on the pass has long been a challenge for drivers traveling between the cities of Hu·∫ø and ƒê√† N·∫µng. Since the completion of H·∫£i V√¢n Tunnel, traffic flow and safety have improved. The pass has been the scene of at least two of Vietnam's most serious rail accidents, and at least one air crash. Overview The H·∫£i V√¢n Pass crosses over a spur of the Tr∆∞·ªùng S∆°n (Annamite) Range that emerges from the west and juts into the South China Sea, forming the H·∫£i V√¢n Peninsula and the adjoining Son Tra Island. The pass, which once formed the boundary between the kingdoms of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát and Champa, also forms a boundary between the climates of northern and southern Vietnam, sheltering the city of Da Nang from the \\"Chinese winds\\" that blow in from the northwest. During the winter months (November‚ÄìMarch), for instance, weather on the north side of the pass might be wet and cold, while the south side might be warm and dry. The pass is renowned for its scenic beauty. Presenter Jeremy Clarkson, host of the BBC motoring programme Top Gear, featured the pass during the show's 2008 Vietnam Special, calling the road \\"a deserted ribbon of perfection‚Äîone of the best coast roads in the world.\\" History H·∫£i V√¢n Pass has been of major strategic importance in this history of Vietnam, and for a long time represented a major barrier to any land army that attempted to move between the northern and central regions of the country. During the 1st century A.D., the Chinese general Ma Yuan (M√£ Vi·ªán), after pacifying northern Vietnam, advanced south and established the southern border of the Han (H√°n) empire by setting up columns of bronze, possibly at H·∫£i V√¢n.L√™ Thanh Khoi, Histoire du Viet Nam des origines a 1858 (Paris: Sudestasie, 1981), 94. Ma Yuan also left behind some Chinese military families to hold the frontier. When the Han empire collapsed at the end of the 2nd century, the local kingdom of Linyi (L√¢m ·∫§p), the predecessor to the medieval polity of Champa, was created by a petty frontier bureaucrat of the Han administration, probably in the area of modern Hu·∫ø somewhat to the north. Transport The pass is crossed by two main transport routes: Vietnam's main north‚Äìsouth highway, National Route 1A, and the North‚ÄìSouth Railway. The road uses the H·∫£i V√¢n Tunnel‚Äîthe longest tunnel in Southeast Asia‚Äîwhile the railway hugs the coastline, passing through a series of tunnels along the way. The old National Route 1A crosses over the mountain more or less directly, climbing to an elevation of and passing south of the high Ai Van Son peak. Travel time on it can be up to an hour longer. In Top Gear series 12's Vietnam Special, Jeremy Clarkson called this route \\"one of the best coast roads in the world.\\" Accidents Besides its beauty, the pass is also renowned for its difficulty. A poem by Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c Chu (1675‚Äì1725) describes H·∫£i V√¢n as \\"the most dangerous mountain in Vietnam\\" ().Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c Chu, \\"·∫¢i lƒ©nh xu√¢n v√¢n\\". Visibility on the pass is often reduced by the eponymous mists that rise from the sea. Along with the road's winding route through the pass, this posed a serious challenge for drivers before the construction of the H·∫£i V√¢n Tunnel. The Hai Van Pass has also been the scene of at least two of Vietnam's most serious rail accidents, and at least one air crash. * 24 June 1953 ‚Äì 1953 Col des Nuages derailment: \\"About 100 or more\\" were killed when two locomotives and 18 cars of a passenger train plunged 50 feet through a sabotaged viaduct in the Col des Nuages, now known as the Hai Van Pass. Officials said that a strong explosive charge went off just as the train arrived at the viaduct, tumbling a 25-foot span into the ravine. The pass had frequently been the scene of attacks by the Viet Minh.Fort Walton Beach, Florida, \\"Indochina Rail Crash Kills 100\\". Playground News, 25 June 1953, Volume 8, Number 22, p. 8. * 28 December 1969 - a United States Marine Corps CH-46 helicopter #153379 from Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 364, crashed in Hai Van pass.

It was formed in August 1942 and disbanded in July 1946 after seeing action against the Japanese in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II. During the war, it operated the Bristol Beaufighter, which it operated in long-range fighter and ground-attack missions. The squadron was re-raised for its current role in July 2010. History No. 31 Squadron was formed at RAAF Base Wagga on 14 August 1942 and was equipped with Bristol Beaufighter fighter and attack aircraft, the first of which was received on 23 August 1942.. Under the command of Squadron Leader Charles Frederick Read, who later went on to serve as Chief of the Air Staff,. the squadron undertook a period of training before deploying to Batchelor Airfield, Northern Territory, in October, the aircraft flying via Alice Springs. A period of more intense training followed and familiarisation flights were carried out before moving to its operational base at Coomalie Creek Airfield on 12 November and then began flying combat operations on 17 November, attacking targets in Portuguese Timor.. During its first attack, the squadron lost one Beaufighter after being attacked by Japanese fighter aircraft. The following month, on 2 December, the squadron had was involved in more successful attack, striking a Japanese airfield at Penfoei, where they destroyed 18 aircraft without losing any of their own. Later that month, the squadron shot down its first Japanese aircraft, the honours going to Sergeant Eric Barnett who shot down a single-engined Nakajima Ki-27 \\"Nate\\" fighter over Fuiloro. From then the squadron flew ground-attack missions against Japanese forces in the Netherlands East Indies (NEI), concentrating on airfields and ships. It operated from Coomalie Creek in this role until December 1944 when the squadron moved to Noemfoor to bring them closer to targets in the region. From then until the end of the war the squadron continued in the ground attack role from bases in the NEI, including Morotai and Tarakan.. A No. 31 Squadron Beaufighter landing at Tarakan in June 1945 As the war progressed, the armament available to the squadron was developed; initially the Beaufighters employed 20 mm cannons and .50 calibre machine guns, but these were later supplemented with bombs and rockets, which were carried on hard points under the wings. With this configuration, the squadron's aircraft achieved several notable successes, including a number of air-to-air victories, as well as destroying many Japanese aircraft on the ground. In its first year of combat operations, the squadron was credited with 18 air-to-air victories and a further 49 aircraft destroyed on the ground; losses amongst the squadron's aircrew were significant, though, due to operating at low level. There were some significant individual feats also. One of the squadron's most successful pilots was Squadron Leader Reginald Lloyd Gordon, who achieved the feat of shooting down two Japanese twin-engined Kawasaki Ki-45 \\"Nick\\" fighters in one operation. In another incident, a flight of four Beaufighters from the squadron shot down three Japanese floatplanes in one sortie during an attack mission on a Japanese naval airbase in the Aru Islands, when they were attacked by nine Japanese aircraft. After the war No. 31 Squadron conducted weather reconnaissance and escorted single-engined aircraft from the NEI to Australia. The squadron returned to Australia in December 1945, moving to Deniliquin, New South Wales, and was disbanded at RAAF Base Williamtown on 9 July 1946.. During the war, 79 men from the squadron were killed in action or died on active service. Members from the squadron received the following decorations: 18 Distinguished Flying Crosses and two bars, one Distinguished Flying Medal, six Mentions in Despatches and one King's Commendation for Brave Conduct. No. 31 Squadron was re-raised on 1 July 2010 as the unit responsible for providing airbase support services to RAAF Base Wagga.

Early career By his own testimony, Shank began his stage career with Pembroke's Men and Queen Elizabeth's Men. \\"Presumably the Pembroke's company in question was that of 1597-1600, and the Queen Elizabeth's Men the travelling company of the latter years of the reign\\"E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 2, p. 338. -- that is to say, the later years of Elizabeth I. Shank was with Prince Henry's Men by 1610, and was a sharer in the company (that is, a partner who shared in the profits rather than a hired man) by 1613. Shank seems to have fulfilled the function that clowns had filled at least since the time of Richard Tarleton: he was a \\"jigging clown\\" who sang and danced the jig that concluded each performance. In the controversy surrounding the Prince's Men's production of The Roaring Girl in 1611, Shank seems to have temporarily lost his jigging function when \\"lewd jigs, songs and dances\\" were suppressed by the Middlesex justices in 1612.Natasha Korda, \\"The Case of Moll Frith: Women's Work and the 'All-Male Stage',\\" in: Women Players in England, 1550-1660: Beyond the All-Male Stage, edited by Pamela Allen Brown and Peter Parolin, London, Ashgate, 2005; pp. 81-2. Maturity Sometime between 1613 and 1619, Shank joined the King's Men; he is listed as a sharer in the company in 1619, and is present in the records of that company till his death. He was noted for playing the Curate in their 1624 revival of Beaumont and Fletcher's The Scornful Lady. His role as Hilario in the King's Men's 1629 production of Massinger's The Picture shows that Shank played comic \\"thin-man\\" roles for the company -- what his own era called the \\"lean fool.\\"Baldwin Maxwell, Studies in Beaumont, Fletcher, and Massinger, Chapel Hill, NC, University of North Carolina Press, 1939; pp. 79-80. This was a standard part of the King's Men's style of theatre; in the previous generation of Shakespeare and Burbage, hired man John Sinkler played thin-man roles like Pinch in The Comedy of Errors and Shadow in Henry IV, Part 2. Shank seems to have been cast in the same dramatic function within the company as Sinkler. Shank may have joined the King's Men as early as 1613; the company was licensed to perform something called Shank's Ordinary, probably a jig, on 16 March 1614. Shank played the clown role in John Clavell's The Soddered Citizen in 1630, and the servant Petella in the 1632 revival of John Fletcher's The Wild Goose Chase. Training boy actors Shank also played an important role in training the company's apprentices, the boy actors who played the female roles in plays prior to the advent of stage actresses in the Restoration era. Shank trained Thomas Pollard, Thomas Holcomb, John Honyman, Nicholas Burt, and John Thompson, who were significant members of the company in the late Jacobean and Caroline eras. (Later, Shank would claim that he spent ¬£40 on Thompson, and ¬£200 on his apprentices overall.) Shank is known to have played at least one female role himself in these years, the minor part of the servant Petella in the company's 1632 revival of Fletcher's The Wild Goose Chase. This suggests that Shank taught boys and young men to play stage females based at least in part on his own experience. Controversy When veteran King's Man John Heminges died in 1630, his shares in the company's two theatres, the Globe and the Blackfriars, passed to his son William Heminges. Between 1633 and 1635, the younger Heminges sold the three shares that he owned in the Globe (the theatre was divided into sixteen shares total), and his two shares in the Blackfriars (out of a total of eight), to Shank, who paid Heminges ¬£506. The sales may have been clandestine, since ownership of the theatre shares was a sensitive subject within the company. When the shareholder system was established for the Globe (1599) and the Blackfriars (1608), most of the shareholders were the company's actors. With the passage of time, a majority of those shares passed to the widows and heirs of the original actors; younger members of the company were left out of the profitable system. In 1635, Eliard Swanston, Robert Benfield, and Thomas Pollard, three actors in the King's Men who were sharers in the company but not \\"householders\\" or shareholders in the theatres, petitioned the Lord Chamberlain -- then Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke -- for the right to purchase shares in the theatres. Pembroke ordered Shank and the Burbage family to sell shares to the three actors; but Shank and Cuthbert Burbage both protested the ruling. The dispute generated a back-and- forth documentation, sometimes called the \\"sharers' papers,\\" that has provided subsequent generations of scholars and researchers with important data on the theatre business of the age. Shank complained that he and the three actors could not reach acceptable terms for a sale, and that they prevented him from performing with the company.Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 339. The dispute seems to have injected a significant degree of bitterness into the last year of Shank's life. Death Local records in London show that for many years, Shank and his family lived in Golden Lane in the parish of St. Giles, Cripplegate (the same parish as Cuthbert Burbage and King's Man Nicholas Tooley). Records of the baptisms and burials of several of his children exist between the years 1610 and 1629. The exact date of Shank's death in unknown, though his funeral was held on 27 January 1636. Shank's 1635 last will and testamentPeter Stallybrass and Ann Rosalind Jones, Renaissance Clothing and the Materials of Memory, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2000; p. 179. required the company to pay his widow ¬£50 as his share of the value of their costumes and plays. The will identifies Shank as a \\"citizen and weaver of London\\" as well as \\"one of his Majesty's servants the players.\\" Professional actors sometimes maintained formal membership in one of the city's guilds so that they could lawfully bind apprentices to contracts -- something that actors, as retainers in noble households, could not do under the prevailing legal system. John Heminges, for example, was a member of the grocers' guild throughout his life; James Burbage was a member of the carpenters' guild, while John Lowin and Robert Armin were goldsmiths' guild members.Andrew Gurr, The Shakespearean Playing Companies, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1996; p. 100. Given Shank's role in training boy players for the company, he likely pursued a similar arrangement. Yet the will (one commentator has called it \\"a masterpiece of acrimony\\") also specified that the company owed him ¬£16 20s. for two gowns; Shank may have had some role in providing the costumes of the troupe. On the modern stage In an April 2000 production at the Albery Theatre, Shank was played by Michael Gambon in Nicholas Wright's comedy Cressida. Set in 1635, near the end of the era in which female roles were played by boys, Wright's play shows Shank coaching a boy actor in the role of Cressida while giving the company a masterclass in acting as a craft.

Handroanthus chrysanthus (araguaney or yellow ip√™), formerly classified as Tabebuia chrysantha, also known as araguaney in Venezuela, as guayac√°n in Colombia and Ecuador, as tajibo in Bolivia, and as ip√™-amarelo in Brazil, is a native tree of the intertropical broadleaf deciduous forests of South America above the Tropic of Capricorn. On May 29, 1948, Handroanthus chrysanthus was declared National Tree of Venezuela since being an emblematic native species of extraordinary beauty. Its deep yellow resembles the one on the Venezuelan flag. Designation Chrysantha is derived from two Greek words, œáœÅ·ø°œÉ-œåœÇ gold + ·ºÑŒΩŒ∏Œµ¬µŒøŒΩ flower. Araguaney appears to derive from \\"aravenei\\", the ancient word by which the Kalina people (Caribs) designated this tree. Habitat The araguaney is found in clearings of deciduous tropical forests of the broad Guiana Shield region.Global Forest Watch - Overview of Venezuela It is also native to warm lands and sabanas (V√≠a Oriente to El Guapo, Cupira, and Uchire Sabana) and even some arid hills (Mampote, Guarenas, Guatire y Caucagua). Its habitat ranges 400 to 1700m above sea level. Description It is a rustic deciduous tree that defies hard, dry or poor soils. Therefore, its roots require well drained terrain. Its height ranges 6 to 12m. Leaves are opposite and petiolate, elliptic and lanceolate, with pinnate venation. Flowers are large, tubular shaped, with broadening corolla of deep yellow colour, about 2 inches long; they come out (February to April) before the tree has grown back any leaves. The fruit consists of dehiscent capsule often matured by the end of dry season. It is a slow growing, but long lasting, tree.Hoyos F., Jes√∫s (1983) \\"Gu√≠a de √°rboles de Venezuela\\", Caracas. Sociedad de Ciencias Naturales La Salle. Monograf√≠a N¬∫ 32. As said, flowering and fruiting take place in dry season, from February to April, this way the seeds can take advantage of early rains. If raining season is delayed, the araguaney may flower and fruit, mildly, a second time. It is a highly efficient moisture manager. As happens with mango, the araguaney biological functions requiring most water take place precisely during dry season.

He was also a member of Saxon nobility as Count of Derlingau and of Nordth√ºringgau. Born the eldest son of Lothar II the Old, Count of Walbeck, and Matilda von Arneburg, he succeeded his father as Lothar III, Count of Walbeck, in 964. He was a paternal uncle of the chronicler Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg, son of his younger brother Siegfried. Lothair did not inherit the County of Walbeck, but rather became count in the Derlingau and Nordth√ºringgau of Eastphalia in 982. When his brother Siegfried died in 990, he tried to seize all his mother's possessions to the disadvantage of his nephews. After Count Dietrich of Haldensleben in 983 had been deposed from the Northern March for failing to defend the bishoprics of Brandenburg and Havelberg east of the Elbe river in the Great Slav Rising, he was replaced by Lothair, who was first mentioned as margrave in 993. However, his attempts to wrest the eastern territories of the Northern March from the Slavic Lutici were unsuccessful and he actually ruled only over a small strip of land along the Elbe in the southwest. Lothair came into conflict with Margrave Eckard I of Meissen over the arranged marriage of his eldest son Werner with Eckard's daughter Liutgard, which the Meissen margrave opposed. He therefore put up resistance against Eckard's candidacy for the succession of late Emperor Otto III in 1002 and won the Saxon nobles over for the support of rivaling Duke Henry IV of Bavaria. Eckard was murdered in the same year, and the wedding of Werner and Liutgard could take place. Lothair married Godila (d. 1015), daughter of Werner, Count of Rothenburg. Lothair and Godila had five children: * Werner, Margrave of the Nordmarkt * Lothar (d. in battle, 1033), Count of Harzgau. Sometimes referred to as Lothar IV, Count of Walbeck, but not included in Thietmar's description of the House of Lothar. * Berthold von Walbeck (d. 1018 or after), married Irmgard von Aspel (d. before 1022), daughter of Godizo, Count of Aspel, and Adela de Verdun, daughter of Godfrey the Prisoner, Count of Verdun * Dietrich, Canon at Magdeburg * Birgida, Abbess of St. Lawrence at Magdeburg. Sometimes claimed as daughter of Frederick, Count of Walbeck. Margrave Lothair died in 1003 and was buried in Cologne. His widow, Godila of Rothenburg, remained unmarried for four years after his death, eventually marrying Herman II, Count of Werl. His first-born son Werner succeeded him in the Northern March and his second son, Count Lothar IV of Walbeck, eventually also placed a claim on it. His third son, Berthold, rebelled in 1017 and submitted in 1018, and his youngest son, Dietrich, became a canon at Magdeburg around 1008.

Talmage (1984). Articles of Faith. (rev. ed.) Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, p. 193. Prior to October 2019, the church's organizations were called auxiliary organizations. As the term suggested, the LDS Church's organizations are ancillary to the governing power of the priesthood in the church. The LDS Church's five organizations are Primary, Relief Society, Sunday School, Young Men, and Young Women. The existence of the LDS Church's organizations as a means of assisting the priesthood is based on the Apostle Paul's statement that God has established \\"helps\\" and \\"governments\\" in the church to assist the apostles and prophets who lead the church.1 Corinthians 12:28. Apostle Harold B. Lee taught that \\"an auxiliary is to be an aid to the priesthood in watching over the Church and also an aid to the home, under the direction and ... cooperation [of] the priesthood.\\"Harold B. Lee, Clyde J. Williams (ed.) (1996). Teachings of Harold B. Lee, Eleventh President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Salt Lake City, Utah: Bookcraft, p. 263. The purpose of the organizations is to help \\"plant and make grow ... a testimony of Christ and of the Gospel.\\"First Presidency, \\"Memorandum of Suggestions,\\" March 29, 1940, p. 2, quoted in Richard G. Scott, \\"The Doctrinal Foundation of the Auxiliaries\\", Ensign, August 2005, pp. 62‚Äì67. According to Joseph F. Smith, the church's organizations are temporary organizations which may be created and discontinued as the needs of the church and the priesthood hierarchy change.Joseph F. Smith, Juvenile Instructor, vol. 39, Jan. 1, 1904, pp. 17‚Äì18. While serving as the church's president, Smith further stated: > We expect to see the day, if we live long enough ... when every council of > the Priesthood in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will > understand its duty; will assume its own responsibility, will magnify its > calling, and fill its place in the Church, to the uttermost, according to > the intelligence and ability possessed by it. When that day shall come, > there will not be so much necessity for work that is now being done by the > auxiliary organizations, because it will be done by the regular quorums of > the Priesthood.Joseph F. Smith, Conference Report, April 1906, p. 3, in > Joseph F. Smith (1977). Gospel Doctrine (rev. ed.) Salt Lake City, Utah: > Deseret Book, p. 159. In the LDS Church today, each organization is headed by a church-wide \\"general president\\" and two counselors; the three individuals together form the organization's \\"general presidency.\\". These individuals are not general authorities of the church, but are referred to as \\"general officers\\" of the church. Like general authorities, general officers are \\"accepted and sustained\\" by the members of the church as leaders in their respective areas of jurisdiction, which are set out by the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Additionally, each of the organizations exists at a local ward and stake level, with presidencies formed to direct the work of the organization in that particular region, except for the stake Sunday School organization. A member of the stake high council serves as the stake Sunday School president and may serve with or without counselors or a secretary. Leaders of organizations at the ward and stake levels are called \\"ward officers\\" and \\"stake officers,\\" respectively. Local organization presidencies work under the direction of the local priesthood leaders, which in most cases are the bishop and the stake president. Part of the changes announced in October 2019 was to discontinue the presidency of the Young Men at the ward level.
