As such, avidity is distinct from affinity, which describes the strength of a single interaction. However, because individual binding events increase the likelihood of other interactions to occur (i.e. increase the local concentration of each binding partner in proximity to the binding site), avidity should not be thought of as the mere sum of its constituent affinities but as the combined effect of all affinities participating in the biomolecular interaction. A particular important aspect relates to the phenomenon of 'avidity entropy'. Biomolecules often form heterogenous complexes or homogeneous oligomers and multimers or polymers. If clustered proteins form an organized matrix, such as the clathrin-coat, the interaction is described as a matricity. Antibody-antigen interaction Avidity is commonly applied to antibody interactions in which multiple antigen-binding sites simultaneously interact with the target antigenic epitopes, often in multimerized structures. Individually, each binding interaction may be readily broken; however, when many binding interactions are present at the same time, transient unbinding of a single site does not allow the molecule to diffuse away, and binding of that weak interaction is likely to be restored. Each antibody has at least two antigen-binding sites, therefore antibodies are bivalent to multivalent. Avidity (functional affinity) is the accumulated strength of multiple affinities. For example, IgM is said to have low affinity but high avidity because it has 10 weak binding sites for antigen as opposed to the 2 stronger binding sites of IgG, IgE and IgD with higher single binding affinities. Affinity Binding affinity is a measure of dynamic equilibrium of the ratio of on-rate (kon) and off-rate (koff) under specific concentrations of reactants. The affinity constant, Ka, is the inverse of the dissociation constant, Kd. The strength of complex formation in solution is related to the stability constants of complexes, however in case of large biomolecules, such as receptor-ligand pairs, their interaction is also dependent on other structural and thermodynamic properties of reactants plus their orientation and immobilization. There are several methods to investigate protein‚Äìprotein interactions existing with differences in immobilization of each reactant in 2D or 3D orientation. The measured affinities are stored in public databases, such as the Ki Database and BindingDB. As an example, affinity is the binding strength between the complex structures of the epitope of antigenic determinant and paratope of antigen-binding site of an antibody. Participating non-covalent interactions may include hydrogen bonds, electrostatic bonds, van der Waals forces and hydrophobic forces. Calculation of binding affinity for bimolecular reaction (1 antibody binding site per 1 antigen): :[Ab] + [Ag] <=> [AbAg] where [Ab] is the antibody concentration and [Ag] is the antigen concentration, either in free ([Ab],[Ag]) or bound ([AbAg]) state. calculation of association constant (or equilibrium constant): :K_a = \\\\frac{k_\\\\ce{on}}{k_\\\\ce{off}} = \\\\frac\\\\ce{[AbAg]}\\\\ce{[Ab][Ag]} calculation of dissociation constant: :K_d = \\\\frac{k_\\\\ce{off}}{k_\\\\ce{on}} = \\\\frac\\\\ce{[Ab][Ag]}\\\\ce{[AbAg]} Application Avidity tests for rubella virus, Toxoplasma gondii, cytomegalovirus (CMV), varicella-zoster virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis viruses, Epstein-Barr virus, and others were developed a few years ago. These tests help to distinguish acute, recurrent or past infection by avidity of marker-specific IgG. Currently there are two avidity assays in use. These are the well known chaotropic (conventional) assay and the recently developed AVIcomp (avidity competition) assay.

The song lyrics meditate on a tempting but imprudent and perhaps adulterous (\\"neither one of us is free\\") love affair. The first recording of the song was by Gayle McCormick (formerly of the band Smith) on her 1974 solo album One More Hour. Cover Versions In the autumn of 1976 Charlie Rich recorded the song at Columbia Recording Studio in Nashville with Billy Sherrill producing: the track was issued on Rich's final album for Epic Records Take Me (1977) and in March 1977 had a UK single release. Kerry Chater himself recorded the song for his 1977 Part Time Love album. In April 1980 Epic gave Rich's version a belated US single release (possibly due to recordings issued by Dolly Parton and Conway Twitty/Loretta Lynn as album cuts around that time - as well as the longstanding popularity of a 1978 Kenny Rogers album on which it was also featured), resulting in minor C&W; hit status (#61).

It was originally devised as a therapy for children with psychological, physical, or developmental disabilities. Its early development was influenced by Rudolph Steiner and anthroposophical philosophy and teachings. Nordoff‚ÄìRobbins music therapy is grounded in the belief that everyone can respond to music, no matter how ill or disabled. It holds that the unique qualities of music as therapy can enhance communication, support change, and enable people to live more resourcefully and creatively. Nordoff- Robbins music therapists practice worldwide and have graduated from training programs around the world including the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, Germany, New Zealand, Scotland, South Africa, and the Far East. United Kingdom Nordoff Robbins is a registered UK charity that receives no statutory funding. The charity runs the Nordoff Robbins music therapy centre in London and a number of music therapy outreach projects nationwide. It also runs postgraduate training courses in music therapy and a research programme with regular public courses and conferences. Nordoff Robbins runs the annual Silver Clef Awards that raise money for the charity.\\"Coldplay Win Nordoff- Robbins Award\\", Clash, May 15, 2013. United States Founded by Dr. Clive Robbins and Carol Robbins, the Nordoff‚ÄìRobbins Center for Music Therapy at New York University, Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, opened in 1989. The Center is affiliated with New York University's Graduate Music Therapy Program. The mission of the Center has six main components: # Providing music therapy services to children, adolescents, and adults with a wide range of needs, abilities, and disabilities including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), behavioral disorders, developmental delays, sensory impairments, multiple handicaps, and psychiatric disorders. The Center provides individual and group therapy sessions, and also provides services for adults struggling with difficult life circumstances or seeking an expressive form of therapy in order to pursue greater self-understanding. # Offering advanced music therapy training. The Center offers three levels of training: a) fieldwork and internships for students pursuing academic degrees in music therapy; b) postgraduate certificate training in the Nordoff-Robbins approach; and c) continuing education courses for music therapy professionals. # Conducting and publishing research. The Center maintains an extensive archive that includes recordings and documentation of the pioneering work of Nordoff and Robbins (1959‚Äì1976). The archive is continually being expanded and updated by contemporary clinical work. Ongoing research in clinical practice focuses on the role of improvisational music therapy in addressing the needs of clients with different areas of disability including autism spectrum disorder, stroke, and hearing impairment. # Presenting lectures, workshops, and symposia to professional audiences. The Center's video documentation of therapy sessions makes it possible to communicate to professional audiences the nature and dynamics of the creative music therapy process. The Center's therapists and researchers lecture nationally and internationally. # Publishing musical and instructional materials. The Center produces audio, video, and printed materials that provide musical resources and instruction in clinical process and improvisation. # Disseminating information and resources. The Center serves as a resource for music therapists, students, musicians, allied professionals, parents, the media, and the general public. It provides consultant services, organizes seminars and workshops, and hosts over 150 visitors annually. The Nordoff‚ÄìRobbins training at Molloy College, established in 2010, is the newest approved Nordoff‚ÄìRobbins program in the US. It is located at The Rebecca Center for Music Therapy at Molloy College, an outpatient center serving children and adults in the Long Island and metropolitan New York area.

At a fairly young age he was shanghaied onto a seagoing freighter where he sailed the icy seas of the North Atlantic. It was a number of years before he found an opportunity to make a successful escape. He ventured to St. Joseph, Missouri where he was employed as a hostler by Fish and Robidoux in 1859. During that time he also rode race horses at a popular track on Sparta Road. Billy Richardson is believed by many to have been the first westbound rider for the Pony Express. The contemporaneous newspaper account (written within hours of the actual event) as it appeared on April 4, 1860 in the St. Joseph Daily West, recorded him as the first Pony Express rider on April 3, 1860, \\"The rider is a Mr. Richardson, formerly a sailor, and a man accustomed to every description of hardship, having sailed for years amid the snows and icebergs of the Northern ocean.\\" The article was reprinted in The Weekly West. In the photo of the four Expressmen, Billy Richardson pictured in a sailor's hat and jacket is standing next to Johnny Fry. Also pictured is Charlie and Gus Cliff, the other Westbound riders for Lewis' division. Apparently, the expressmen had drawn straws to determine who would make the inaugural ride. Johnny Fry drew the shortest straw, which meant he would make the ride, but injured himself the day before, so Richardson, who was next in line, replaced him. Years later, a W. B. Richardson (1851‚Äì1946) claimed to be the Pony Express rider denied the honor, in an article titled \\"Uncle Billy Richardson, 91 Today, Disclaims Fame.\\" W. B., who would have been about ten years old the day of the historic ride, boasts that his half brother Paul Coburn, who was the station manager, \\"accidentally\\" threw the \\"mail pouch\\" on his pony instead of Fry's horse and so he made the ride. His recollection contradicts all historic accounts. Clearly, J. W. Richardson, the actual rider, was not W. B. Richardson, a nine- or ten-year-old boy, but a grown man when he was hired by Lewis for Russell, Majors and Waddell. He rode for the company until the transcontinental telegraph went into service. According to his relatives he rode on to Fort Laramie and died later that year.

Located on the Atlantic Ocean at the head of Sambro Harbour, the community is immediately west of the entrance to Halifax Harbour. Sambro is located at the end of Route 306. Sambro Island is located within the community southeast of the harbour and is home to the Sambro Island Lighthouse, the oldest operational lighthouse in the Americas (since 1758). It stands 62 feet on the top of the rocky island. The original lens from the lighthouse is on display at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax. Sambro Harbour also has a small pepperpot style lighthouse located at the harbour entrance. History Three years after the founding of Halifax in 1752, 26 families settled and worked on Sambro Island after Governor Edward Cornwallis saw the need to populate the area with British settlers to prevent a French attack by sea. The community has evolved into a fishing and tourist community over the centuries, although many residents currently commute into Halifax for employment. During the American Revolution, Sambro witnessed numerous naval battles, such as the Naval battle off Halifax. On 10 July 1780, the British privateer Resolution (16 guns) under the command of Thomas Ross engaged the American privateer Viper (16 guns) off of Halifax at Sambro Light. There was another engagement, described as ‚Äúone of the bloodiest battles in the history of privateering‚Äù. The two privateers began a ‚Äúsevere engagement‚Äù,Simeon Perkins Diary. 13 July Thur. 1780 during which both pounded each other with cannon fire for about 90 minutes. ‚Ä¢ The death toll was 18 British and 33 Americans.There are varying reports on the casualties. Another source indicates that the Americans reported between 3 died (British reporting 30 American died), while British reported 8 killed and 10 wounded. On September 1, 1782 the American Privateer Wasp sailed to Pennant Point where they were confronted by three men from Sambro who fired on them, killing one of his crew and wounding three others including Captain Thomas Thompson. Captain Perry took command of the vessel and the privateers took one of the Sambro men prisoner. The privateers buried their crew member on an island in Pennant bay. They then began their return to Massachusetts by rowing to West Dover, Nova Scotia and then on to Cross Island (\\"Croo Island\\") just off Lunenburg (\\"Malegash\\"). ‚Ä¢ During the American Civil War, Sambro played a pivotal role in the Chesapeake Affair. A Northern vessel was stolen by a crew Southern sympathisers who were loading the vessel with coal at Sambro for the journey to the southern states.

He was on friendly terms with both Ludwig van Beethovenhe was one of only two people present at his deathand Franz Schubert, his recollections of whom constitute an interesting but probably unreliable document in Schubertian biographical studies. Life H√ºttenbrenner was born in Graz, the son of a wealthy landowner. He attended the Graz Lyzeum, and studied law at the University of Graz, but was also composing music at this time. Count Moritz von Fries (1777-1826) was impressed with his ability as a pianist, and following the Count's advice, H√ºttenbrenner left in April 1815 for Vienna to study under Antonio Salieri. Years later, he visited Beethoven on his deathbed, who greeted him with the words \\"I am not worthy of your visiting me\\". He was also present on 26 March 1827, at the time of Beethoven's death, when the only other person present was Beethoven's housekeeper. In commemoration of the moment, Huttenbrenner cut a lock of Beethoven's hair, now in Graz together with Beethoven's family archival book in the Fux Conservatory.Vgl.

His first published works (for piano and Lieder) began to appear shortly afterwards, and the String Quartet (Op. 3) came out in 1816. He briefly returned to Graz in 1818, but was back in Vienna the following year, earning a living in a government office. In 1821 H√ºttenbrenner inherited the family estate and married. Three friends (Johann Baptist Jenger, Anselm H√ºttenbrenner and Franz Schubert) by Josef Eduard Teltscher, 1827 Schubert sent the manuscript of his Unfinished Symphony to H√ºttenbrenner, via H√ºttenbrenner's brother Josef, around 1823. The manuscript remained with H√ºttenbrenner until Johann Herbeck visited him in Ober-Andritz near Graz in 1865, and took the score away with him back to Vienna, where he conducted the first performance in December 1865. H√ºttenbrenner held the post of director of the Steierm√§rkischer Musikverein from 1825 to 1829. His Requiem in C minor was performed at Schubert's memorial service on 23 December 1828. He was a follower of Jakob Lorber and from 1840 he participated actively in the put down in writing of what was allegedly dictated to Lorber by God. H√ºttenbrenner died in Ober-Andritz at the age of 73.

He said the film \\"was very self indulgent because I wouldn't listen to advice. It's dangerous to have fashion and power and I was fashionable then.\\" The film was the most expensive British production of its year. The film was shot in the Loire Valley in France, because it was the only place without telegraph poles. Several thousand American soldiers posted nearby in Orl√©ans were used as extras. Shooting took six weeks. \\"The only way we were able to finish a film this ambitious on such a modest budget was by using a regular crew, so there were no fights, we just tackled it and went on until the finish\\", said Thomas. Critical reception The New York Times wrote \\"it is mostly a bloodless and sober, albeit meticulous account that is spun here\\"; The Monthly Film Bulletin called it \\"an eminently respectable but scarcely distinguished addition to the list of filmed Dickens\\", noting that Rosalie Crutchley's \\"tirelessly bloodthirsty Mme Defarge ‚Äì blatantly theatrical but full of gusto ‚Äì is particularly welcome.

It uniquely links all three of the major hydropower projects in South Carolina: Lake Murray, Lake Marion and Lake Moultrie. Route description The highway runs generally southeast from the central part of South Carolina to near the Atlantic Ocean and is listed as a hurricane evacuation route.http://www.scdot.org/getting/pdfs/HurricaneMapText.pdf Beginning at a junction with U.S. Highway 52 in Moncks Corner, the route runs northwest along the shoreline of Lake Moultrie as West Main Street. It then turns right onto Ranger Drive. It turns left onto \\"Old Number Six Highway\\" where is later starts a concurrency with SC 45 as Eutaw Road. The concurrency runs and far from Lake Marion, and passes through Eutawville. There SC 45 departs to the west and SC 6 continues along the lake through Vance to Santee, where it intersects Interstate 95. It then adjoins the Santee State Park on its right. After a concurrency with SC 267 begins, it becomes Main Street through Elloree, South Carolina. The concurrency ends when SC 267 turns off to the right onto Lonestar Road. SC 6 then traverses St. Matthews as Bridge Street before having a brief concurrency with U.S. Highway 176. Route 26 turns left onto Caw Caw Highway and has an interchange with Interstate 26. The route turns right and head northwest in a concurrency with U.S. Route 21 and then separates from U.S. 21 onto Center Hill Road. It turns right on St. Matthews Road in a northwesterly direction, passing through Swansea as 2nd Street intersecting U.S. Route 321 in town and joining a concurrency with SC 302 as Edmund Hwy. The concurrency ends when SC 6 turns to the left onto S. Lake Drive where it heads northwest to Red Bank. In Red Bank, it intersects with Interstate 20. The route then passes through Lexington where it briefly separates into a one-way street pair. It crosses U.S. Route 1 and has a brief concurrency with U.S. Route 378. SC 6 passes just east of Lake Murray (over the Saluda Dam as a divided highway). In Irmo, SC 6 changes from N. Lake Drive to Dreher Shoals Road before ending at a junction with U.S. Highway 76 in Ballentine. The last section of the route runs south and west of Columbia, the state capital. Counties traversed by the route include Berkeley, Orangeburg, Calhoun, Lexington, and Richland. Major intersections Moncks Corner truck route South Carolina Highway 6 Truck (SC 6 Truck) is a truck route in the central portion of Moncks Corner, which is in the central portion of Berkeley County. The entire length is concurrent with U.S. Route 17 Alternate (US 17 Alt.) and US 52\\\\. The truck route begins at an intersection with the SC 6 mainline (Main Street). At this intersection, it begins concurrent with US 17 Alt. (South Live Oak Drive). The two highways travel to the northeast and curve to the east-northeast. They pass the Berkeley County Courthouse and the Berkeley County Sheriff's Office. An intersection with the northern terminus of Carolina Avenue leads to the historic downtown, city hall, and recreation complex of the city. They travel on a bridge over some railroad tracks of CSX and then pass Berkeley Middle School. After passing the Moncks Corner Medical Center, they intersect US 52\\\\. Here, SC 6 Truck turns right and follows US 52 to the south-southwest. The two highways travel along a retail corridor.

National protection Due to the tapping of oil reserves in the early 20th century, Azerbaijan has had sufficient resources to develop an industrial sector, which in turn led to a significant increase in pollution. Under the centrally-planned Soviet command economy Baku became an industrialized capital city. Moscow could, for example, order that all air conditioners in the Soviet Union be built in Azerbaijan, such arbitrary and unilateral control of industrial output often led to environmental neglect and increased pollution, which caused serious damage to nature within Azerbaijan. Since the independence of Azerbaijan, the Azerbaijani government has taken drastic measures to preserve the unique nature of Azerbaijan. But national protection of Azeri nature started truly functioning after 2001 when the state budget increased due to new revenues provided by the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline. Within the last four years protected nature areas doubled to is equal to eight percent of the country's territory. The measures taken by the president were applauded by foreign organizations, in fact, President Ilham Aliyev was awarded Germany Mikhail Zhukov Fund's prize for his successful ecological policy on 19 October 2006.President of Azerbaijan receives award. Since 2001 the government has set up seven large reserves and almost doubled the sector of the budget earmarked for environmental protection.Ecological problems in Azerbaijan On October 4, 2016 Azerbaijani officials announced their plans for further improvement of the ecological situation in Baku Bay, which will take place during 2016‚Äì2020. State Reserves of Azerbaijan Gobustan. The state-run Nature Reserves aim to protect nature, wildlife and the environment. They allow scientists to conduct natural research. They are specifically designed for the protection of common and rare species of flora and fauna. Azeri law strictly prohibits industrial development or meddling with animals or plants within the borders of the state parks. There are 16 state natural parks in Azerbaijan that preserve and protect the fauna, flora and their ecosystems. See below for the list: * Ag-Gel State Reserve * Basut-Chay State Reserve * Eldar Pine State Reserve * Gara-Yaz State Reserve * Gizil-Agach State Reserve * Gobustan State Reserve * Ilisu State Reserve * Ismailli State Reserve * Pirgulu State Reserve * Shahbuz State Reserve * Shirvan State Reserve * Turian-Chay State Reserve * Qaragol State Reserve * Zagatala State Reserve National parks Murov mountain in Azerbaijan. Ismailli Reserve in Azerbaijan. National Parks of Azerbaijan refers to the National Parks in the territory of Azerbaijan. National Parks have peculiarities and ensure a strong security system and all favorable conditions for animals living within the park. National Parks in Azerbaijan are restricted tourism zones but are open for observation of the natural processes. Ecotourism and other infrastructural constructions are currently being established in the national parks of Azerbaijan. As a country located in both the Caucasus and Asia Minor, between the Black and Caspian Seas, Azerbaijan has a rich natural culture, and the widest biodiversity of all the European states and has enormous natural resources. The natural reserves play a crucial role in the preservation of this biodiversity. Azerbaijan has a total of 7 national parks, 13 state natural parks and 21 reserves, which can be seen here below. A seventh national park the Shakhdag National Park was established in 2008, Shakhdag is the largest national park in the Caucasus and one of the largest in Europe.Shakhdag to become one of the largest national parks in Europe * Absheron National Park * Ag-Gol National Park * Altyaghach National Park * G√∂yg√∂l National Park * Hirkan National Park * Shakhdag National Park * Shirvan National Park * Zangezur National Park State Natural Game Reserve Game Reserves are reserves with the purpose of maintaining wildlife. Some game reserves also allow hunting. The State Game Reserves in Major Caucasus in Azerbaijan are: * State Game Reserve of Shaki * State Game Reserve of Qusar * State Game Reserve of Qabala * State Game Reserve of Ismailly * State Game Reserve of Qakh The natural complexes with the Minor Caucasus are: * State Game Reserve of Qubadly * State Game Reserve of Lachyn * State Game Reserve of Dashalty * State Game Reserve of Qyzyldja * State Game Reserve of Arazboyu Four State Game Reserves of Azerbaijan (Lachyn, Gubadly, Dashalty, Arazboylu with a total area of about 440 km2) are not currently operating as a result of the Armenian occupation of Azerbaijani territories. Orography Azerbaijan is home to a vast variety of landscapes. Over half of Azerbaijan's land mass consists of mountain ridges, crests, yailas and plateaus which rise up to hypsometric levels of 400‚Äì1000 meters (including the Middle and Lower lowlands), in some places (Talis, Jeyranchol-Ajinohur and Langabiz-Alat foreranges) up to 100‚Äì120 metres, and others from 0 ‚Äì 50 meters and up (Gobustan, Absheron). The rest of Azerbaijan's terrain consist of plains and lowlands. Hypsometric marks within the Caucasus region vary from about -28 metres at the Caspian Sea shoreline up to 4466 metres at Mount Bazard√ºz√º.Orography of Azerbaijan Khudafarin Bridge in Azerbaijan. Geology The geology of Azerbaijan forms a constituent geological part of the Alpine folded belt. Sedimentary deposits embracing the southwestern parts of the Major and Minor Caucasus, including the intermountain Kur-River trough, as well as the Mid- and South Caspian basins consist of diversity fold systems. The Earth's crust thickness in Azerbaijan varies in the range from 38 to 55 km. Its maximum thickness is observed in the Minor Caucasus area, while its minimum thickness is typical for the Talysh foothills. Geological setting of the area consists of sedimentary, volcanic-sedimentary, volcanic and terrestrial deposits embracing almost entire stratigraphic range beginning from pre-Cambrian period up to Holocene time. Climate The climate of Azerbaijan is unique, as nine of the Earth's eleven climate zones are found in Azerbaijan.Climates of Azerbaijan Temperature, precipitation, humidity, evaporation and cloudiness all influence the landscape and climate of Azerbaijan. The climate varies considerably from east to west. In the western mountains, the weather is drier and more extreme. The eastern part of Azerbaijan, near the Caspian Sea, has a more moderate climate. As a predominantly mountainous country, Azerbaijan is surrounded by the Greater Caucasus, Lesser Caucasus, Talysh Mountains and North Iranian Mountains. All these aspects create a unique climate in Azerbaijan. Flora Azerbaijan has a rich flora, over 4,500 species of plants have been classified in the country. Due to the unique climate in Azerbaijan, flora is much richer - based on the number of species - than that of other republics of the South Caucasus. About two thirds of all of the species present in the entire Caucasus region can be found in Azerbaijan. Fauna Azerbaijan has an amazingly rich and diverse fauna. The first reports of the diversity of animal life in Azerbaijan can be found in travel notes of Eastern travelers. Animal carvings on architectural monuments, ancient rocks and stones survived up to the present times. There are 106 species of mammals, 97 species of fish, 363 species of birds, 10 species of amphibians and 52 species of reptiles which have been recorded and classified in Azerbaijan. The natural habitat of various types of animals varies within the country. Some species only populate special restricted areas (lakes, parts of mountainous areas) while others are spread throughout the country. For example, passerines can be found anywhere in the territory of Azerbaijan. Protozoa parasites are also registered in all areas of the country, depending on natural habitat of carrier animals such as cattle and poultry. Among mammals, jeyran gazelles populate plain areas, Caucasian goats inhabit the Major Caucasus areas, most species of birds can be found in forests, some in water basins. Some insects occupy agricultural fields, while others are only present in defined ecosystems. A number of animal species are protected from hunting within the natural reserves of Azerbaijan. Karabakh The symbol of fauna in Azerbaijan is the Karabakh horse which is a mountain-steppe racing and riding horse found only in Azerbaijan. The Karabakh horse is esteemed for its good temper, speed, elegance and intelligence. It is one of the oldest breeds, with ancestry dating to the ancient world. The horse was originally developed in the Karabakh region in the 5th century and is named after it.Karabakh horse description Due to the Armenian occupation of Karabakh the last remaining Karabakh horses reside in Shaki. Caspian Sea 220px The Caspian Sea is the largest lake on Earth by both area and volume, with a surface area of 371,000 square kilometres (143,244 mi2) and a volume of 78,200 cubic kilometres (18,761 mi¬≥). It is a landlocked endorheic body of water and lies between Asia and Europe. It has a maximum depth of about . It is called a sea because when the Romans discovered it they tasted the water and found it to be salty. It has a salinity of approximately 1.2 percent, about a third the salinity of sea water. Rivers and Lakes Rivers form the principal part of the water systems of Azerbaijan. There are 8,359 rivers of various lengths within Azerbaijan. Of them 8,188 rivers are less than 25 kilometers in length. Only 24 rivers are over 100 kilometers long. Environmental issues Like most republics of the Soviet Union, Azerbaijan experienced rapid development of all spheres of economics and human activity, which led to an all-round negative impact on the environment, including the inefficient usage of natural resources.

He converted from Anglicanism to the Roman Catholic Church and entered the Passionist Order in 1847 and spent his life working for the conversion of England to the Catholic faith. Birth and education George Spencer was born in Admiralty House, London. He was the son of George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer, at that time First Lord of the Admiralty.Lodge, B. \\"CTS Saints of the Isles: Ignatius Spencer, page 3. Catholic Truth Society, 2005 As a child Spencer lived at the family's seat, Althorp, and was tutored by his governess and his mother. In 1808, at the age of 9, he and his brother, Frederick, went up to Eton College to continue their education. At Eton Spencer fell under the influence of Richard Godley, a stalwart evangelical Anglican who introduced him to various practices of piety and asceticism. Dissatisfied with the education, and evangelical influences, of Eton, the Spencers removed him from the school at Christmas 1814. Spencer's education was then continued under the direction of Charles James Blomfield of Buckinghamshire who both provided a more classical education for the boy and prepared him for the sacrament of confirmation. In October 1817 Spencer went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied divinity. He spent much of the long vacation of 1818 at Tywyn in Merionethshire with his friend Thomas Fremantle.Rev. Father Pius a Spiritu Sancto, The life of Father Ignatius of St. Paul, Passionist (The Hon. & Rev. George Spencer) (London 1866), pp. 45‚Äì7. At Cambridge Spencer enjoyed the company of a circle of friends who often spent their days in conversation, taking tea and playing cards. Lady Spencer reproved her son for what she took to be wasted time. However, Spencer took a first class honours degree upon going down from Cambridge in 1819.Vereb C.P., J. Ignatius Spencer: Apostle of Christian Unity, p. 4. London: Catholic Truth Society, 1992 As was expected at the time, Spencer set off for his 'Grand Tour' with his parents after leaving university. While Spencer clearly enjoyed the cultural aspects of this tour, he was aghast at his encounter with continental Catholicism. Anglican priest Returning from Europe, Spencer undertook studies to prepare for ordination in the Church of England. As the youngest son of an aristocratic family, this was the expected career path that Spencer would take. He studied the classical languages, as well as employing a Jewish scholar to teach him some Hebrew. Thus on 22 December 1822 Spencer was ordained a deacon. For two years Spencer worked in a Sunday school, but also as a magistrate in Northampton and on 13 June 1824 Spencer was ordained a priest. Thereafter his father presented him with the charge of the parish of Brington. Spencer was totally committed to the care of his parish and spent his days visiting his parishioners, the sick and the dying and was often seen dispensing food, clothes and moneys. Conversion to Catholicism During his time at Brington, Spencer began to ask questions about his Anglican faith and doubts clouded his mind. He explored each and every tradition, from High Church to Evangelical and even in his own parish he met many Methodists and other non-conformists. George's education was highly scriptural, and he struggled to find a basis in scripture for the doctrines contained in the 39 Articles. During a holiday on the Isle of Wight Spencer began to read the writings of the early church Fathers, particularly Chrysostom and Gregory the Great. Through this reading, Spencer gradually began to understand the difference between Catholic and Protestant thought. From 1827, Spencer began to make the acquaintance of several Catholic priests who encouraged Spencer to continue with his reading. Soon afterward Spencer received the first of three anonymous letters from a correspondent in Lille. The correspondent was aware of Spencer's troubles and suggested he give further thought to Catholicism. Finally, a meeting with Ambrose Phillipps de Lisle, a recent English convert to Catholicism, set Spencer on the road to conversion. After several encounters with de Lisle and a number of priests, Spencer resigned his living of Brington, and on 30 January 1830 George Spencer was received into the Catholic Church. To remove himself from the public eye and to lessen the blow to his parents, Spencer went to Rome to study at the Venerable English College. Here he came into contact with Nicholas Wiseman, later Cardinal, who tutored him on matters of Catholic tradition. Whilst in Rome Spencer also met Dominic Barberi, the Passionist priest with such enthusiasm for the conversion of England to the Catholic faith. Barberi would later have a great part to play in Spencer's life. During his studies at Rome, George wrote an account of his conversion from the Protestant to the Catholic faith that was published in the Catholic journals, and finally he was ordained a deacon in January 1832,A Short Account of the Conversion of the Hon. and Rev. George Spencer to the Catholic Faith and on the feast of St. Augustine of Canterbury, 28 May of that same year, he was ordained a priest. Crusade of prayer for England In August 1832 Spencer returned to England to act as a curate to a church in Walsall where he was given particular care of a chapel in West Bromwich. Here he opened three schools, gave lectures on religion and made many converts, as well as his usual activities in the parish. Spencer's reputation as a preacher began to grow, and soon he was preaching as far afield as St. Chad's, Manchester, and St. Mary's, Derby. During a visit to France in 1838, Spencer proposed a Crusade of Prayer for the Conversion of England to Hyacinthe-Louis de Qu√©len, the Archbishop of Paris. Many of Spencer's influential friends joined this campaign, and news of it spread throughout Britain and the Empire. In May 1839, he was appointed spiritual director to the seminarians at Oscott College and in the same month preached at St. Chad's, Manchester on The Great Importance of a Reunion Between the Catholics and the Protestants of England and the Method of Effecting It. In January 1840, Spencer visited John Henry Newman at Oriel College, Oxford to ask Newman to join him in prayer for \\"unity in truth\\". Newman sent Spencer away and refused even to see him, but later apologised for this in his Apologia; > \\"This feeling led me into the excess of being very rude to that zealous and > most charitable man, Mr. Spencer, when he came to Oxford in January, 1840, > to get Anglicans to set about praying for Unity. I myself then, or soon > after, drew up such prayers; it was one of the first thoughts which came > upon me after my shock, but I was too much annoyed with the political action > of the members of the Roman Church in England to wish to have anything to do > with them personally. So glad in my heart was I to see him when he came to > my rooms, whither Mr. Palmer of Magdalen brought him, that I could have > laughed for joy; I think I did; but I was very rude to him, I would not meet > him at dinner, and that, (though I did not say so,) because I considered him > \\" in loco apostatx \\" from the Anglican Church, and I hereby beg his pardon > for it.\\"Newman, J. H., Apologia pro Vita Sua, p. 124. Oxford University > Press, 1913 Spencer's 'Crusade' did not only meet with Newman's opposition, but within the Catholic Church in England, where Dr Baines used a pastoral letter to reprimand the activities of 'certain converts'. Whilst Spencer limited his activities for a time, he was soon back at work. In July 1842 he set off on a preaching tour of Ireland to beg the prayers of the Irish for their English brethren. Spencer was also greatly pleased to receive the blessing of Pope Pius IX, who granted a number of indulgences for those who would pray for England.Young C.P., U. \\"Life of Father Ignatius Spencer C.P.\\", page 260. Burns and Oates, 1933 Spencer's Crusade was the first association with the unity of Christians as its aim and it is with this in mind that he is often hailed as the 'Apostle of Ecumenical Prayer‚Äô. Entrance to the Passionists Spencer had often considered the possibility that he might have a vocation to enter the religious life and in 1846 he made a long retreat, finally deciding that it was God's will that he should enter the Passionist Congregation. On 5 January 1847 George Spencer received the Passionist habit from the hands of his old friend Dominic Barberi, who had brought the congregation to England in 1841. Spencer received the religious name Ignatius of Saint Paul, the name he would be known by ever after. Spencer threw himself into Passionist life and after making his religious profession in 1848 began preaching sermons throughout Britain and Ireland, always calling for prayers for the conversion of England. In August 1849, Spencer was preaching in Belgium when he heard of Barberi's death, consequently he was now provincial of the Passionist Congregation in England and Belgium. In 1851, Spencer set out to Rome to gain the approval of the pope for his work; on his return he also met with several prominent bishops, as well as with Emperor Franz Josef of Austria. Death and cause for beatification Window depicting Fr Ignatius, from his shrine Spencer's health had always been precarious at best, and, worn out with continual work, preaching and begging, he suffered a heart attack and died alone in a ditch (the death he had often described as ideal for himself) on 1 October 1864. Spencer was returning from giving a mission in Scotland at the end of September 1864. He stopped at Carstairs to visit an old friend. Leaving his luggage at the station, he walked down the road through the countryside towards the house, and collapsed and died.Condon CP, Hubert. \\"Inspirational People\\", Teachers Enterprise in Religious Education He was buried alongside Dominic Barberi and Elizabeth Prout in St. Anne's, Sutton, St. Helens on 4 October and now rests in the shrine church there. When his body was exhumed in 1973 it was noted that Spencer suffered from horrific arthritis, but that his tongue had not suffered any decay since the day of his death. In March 2007, the Catholic Church announced that the first stage of Spencer's cause for beatification had been completed and that all the necessary documents had been forwarded to Rome. The next step in this process would be a declaration from the Holy See that Spencer could be styled 'Venerable'; on 6 December 2010, the BBC reported that the Vatican had made such a declaration. At 2016, the Spencer was standing for the second of the \\"four steps of the path to canonization as a saint in the Catholic Church\\", that are in the following sequence: Servant of God, Venerable, Blessed and Saint. The firsts step is competence of the local diocese, and the next two steps require the recognition by the Vatican's authorities of two different miracles, attributed to his intercession.

The characters and concept were created by actor Leonard Nimoy, who developed the idea for the series after visiting the SETI project. Science fiction writer Isaac Asimov was credited with providing additional concepts. The script of the debut issue of Primortals was credited to Kate Worley and Lawrence Watt-Evans with art by Scot Eaton and Mike Barreiro. Eaton and Barreiro illustrated the comic for most of its run, while the book was most often scripted by Christopher Mills and later James Chambers. In 1995, Rudy Rupak along with Quebecor Media created the world's first digital comic book using a \\"Choose A Perspective\\" view of the comics. The CD-ROM Comic was distributed by Sierra Entertainment.https://www.leonardnimoy.de/index.php/interviews/408-primortals- extra Premise The comic's plot revolved around humanity's first contact with an alien intelligence called the Primortals. The series showed how, in ancient times, aliens called the Majae removed various species from Earth and raised them to sentience. Avitaur Zeerus, rebellious alien governor of Achernar Three, flees to Earth after being defeated by hostile alien forces. Public reaction to his arrival, and the warnings of alien invasion he gives, are depicted in the comic as ranging from ecstasy to paranoia. Publications Twenty-four regular issues of the comic were published (though numbering of the comic was restarted following issue number 15), as well as a two issue Origins miniseries and a standalone crossover, Teknophage vs. Zeerus.

In 1851, Cook arranged transport to the Great Exhibition of 1851. He organised his first tours to Europe in 1855 and to the United States in 1866. In 1865, the founder's son John Mason Cook began working for the company full-time. In 1871, he became a partner, and the name of the company was changed to Thomas Cook & Son. The company was nationalised along with the railways in 1948, becoming part of the British Transport Commission. After de-nationalisation in 1972, it was acquired by a consortium of Trust House Forte, Midland Bank and the Automobile Association, then subsequently bought by Westdeutsche Landesbank in 1992. In 2001, it was acquired by the German company C&N; Touristic AG, which changed its name to Thomas Cook AG. History dahabeahs of Thomas Cook & Son, (Egypt) Ltd. Berlin: Cosmos art publishing Co., 1893. Brooklyn Museum Archives Thomas Cook & Son was founded by Thomas Cook, a cabinet-maker, in 1841 under the name \\"Thomas Cook\\" to carry temperance supporters by railway between the cities of Leicester, Nottingham, Derby and Birmingham. In 1851, the founder arranged transport to the Great Exhibition of 1851. He organised his first tours to Europe in 1855 and to the United States in 1866. In 1865, the founder's son John Mason Cook began working for the company full-time. In 1871, he became a partner, and the name of the company was changed to Thomas Cook & Son. Thomas Cook had acquired business premises on Fleet Street, London, in 1865. The office also contained a shop which sold travel accessories, including guide books, luggage, telescopes and footwear. Thomas saw his venture as both religious and social service; his son provided the commercial expertise that allowed the company to expand. In accordance with his beliefs, he and his wife also ran a small temperance hotel above the office. Their business model was refined by the introduction of the 'hotel coupon' in 1868. Detachable coupons in a counterfoil book were issued to the traveller. These were valid for either a restaurant meal or an overnight hotel stay, provided they were on Cook's list. Panels from the Thomas Cook Building in Leicester, displaying excursions offered by Thomas Cook In 1866, the agency organised the first escorted tours of the United States for British travellers, picking up passengers from several departure points. John Mason Cook led the excursion which included tours of several Civil War battlefields. In 1871, a brief but bitter partnership called Cook, Son and Jenkins was formed in the United States with an American businessman. The first escorted round-the-world tour departed from London in September 1872. It included a steamship across the Atlantic, a stage coach across America, a paddle steamer to Japan, and an overland journey across China and India. In 1873, publication of the quarterly (monthly from 1883) Cook's Continental Timetable began. It continues to be published in 2020, but no longer by Thomas Cook Publishing, which was wound up by its parent company in 2013; the timetable was relaunched in 2014 by an independent company, under the title European Rail Timetable, no longer affiliated with Thomas Cook Group. Cooks 1907 Handbook to Norway and Denmark In 1874, Thomas Cook introduced his 'circular notes', a product that was originally devised by a London banker in the 1770s and was later superseded by American Express's 'traveller's cheques'.Competition Commission Report 1995 Conflicts of interest between father and son were resolved when the son persuaded his father, Thomas Cook, to retire at the end of 1878. He moved back to Leicester and lived quietly until his death. The firm's growth was consolidated by John Mason Cook and his three sons, especially by its involvement with military transport and postal services for Britain and Egypt during the 1880s when Cook began organising tours to the Middle East. In 1884, the British Government attempted to relieve General Gordon from Khartoum. The British army was transported up the Nile by Thomas Cook & Son. By 1888, the company had established offices around the world, including three in Australia and one in Auckland, New Zealand, and in 1890, the company sold over 3.25 million tickets. A husband and wife might, for example, pay ¬£85 for a Thomas Cook tour of Germany, Switzerland, and France over six weeks. While expensive enough that the trip would likely be the only one in the couple's lifetime, the company would arrange for a variety of activities new to the middle-class, including museum visits, the opera, and mountain climbing. John Mason Cook promoted, and even led, excursions to, for example, the Middle East where he was described as \\"the second-greatest man in Egypt\\". In 1924, the company was renamed Thomas Cook & Son Ltd., after acquiring limited liability status.  Non-family ownership  Thos. Cook & Son ad 1922 With the boom in travel in the Edwardian era, John Mason Cook's sons, Frank Henry, Thomas Albert and Ernest Edward, were even more successful than their father and grandfather had been at running the business. Frank and Ernest opened a new headquarters in Berkeley Street, London in 1926, but unexpectedly sold the business two years later to the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits et des Grandes Express Europ√©ens, operator of the Orient Express. After the Fall of France, the Paris headquarters of the Wagons-Lits company was seized by the Germans, and the British assets taken over by the Custodian of Enemy Property. In 1942, Thomas Cook & Son was sold to Hays Wharf Cartage Company, which was owned by the four major British railway companies. The company was nationalised along with the railways in 1948, becoming part of the British Transport Commission. In the late 1950s, the company began showing information films at town halls throughout Britain to promote 'foreign holidays' (particularly France, Italy, Switzerland and Spain). The company sold \\"inclusive tours\\" (package holidays) using scheduled airlines but refused to sell cheap package holidays which compromised on quality and service. As a result, the company began to lose market share during the 1950s and 1960s, although its operating profits exceeded ¬£1 million for the first time in 1965. The company was denationalised in 1972, when it was acquired from the British Government by a consortium of Trust House Forte, Midland Bank and the Automobile Association. Midland Bank acquired sole control in 1977. The company's name was altered from Thomas Cook & Son, Ltd, to Thomas Cook Group Ltd in 1974, and the company began to relocate most of its administrative functions from London to Peterborough in 1977. During the 1980s, Thomas Cook had its most visible business presence in the US, including robust traveller's cheque sales to regional US banks. The company had enough business critical mass to set up a computer centre near Princeton, New Jersey. Robert Gaffney, Charles Beach, Robin Dennis and Anthony Horne were some of the notable decision-makers in that era. Robert Maxwell bought substantial holdings in the company in 1988 and still held that interest when Crimson/Heritage purchased the US division of Thomas Cook for US$1.3 billion in 1989. In June 1992, following the acquisition of Midland Bank by HSBC, Thomas Cook was sold to the German bank Westdeutsche Landesbank (WestLB) and the charter airline LTU Group for ¬£200 million. In September 1994, American Express (Amex) bought the corporate travel interests of Thomas Cook Travel Inc. which represented about ten percent of the British company's total revenue. However, Amex was not able to buy the venerable Thomas Cook name; an American Express affiliate, Cook Travel Inc., had been operating under that name since 1991 in the United States. Due to contractual difficulties LTU Group sold its 10% shares to WestLB in May 1995. During 1996 the company bought short-haul operator Sunworld and European city-breaks tour group Time Off. Within three years the company had combined Sunworld, Sunset, Inspirations, Flying Colours and Caledonian Airways into the JMC (for 'John Mason Cook') brand. On 2 February 1999, the Carlson Leisure Group merged with Thomas Cook into a holding company owned by West LB, Carlson Inc and Preussag Aktiengesellschaft (\\"Preussag\\"). In 2000, the company announced its intention to sell its financial services division, in order to concentrate on tours and holidays. In March 2001 the financial services division was sold to Travelex, who retained the right to use the Thomas Cook brand on traveller's cheques for five years. It sold off its worldwide foreign exchange business to Travelex in November 2000. In 2001, Thomas Cook was acquired by the German company C&N; Touristic AG, which changed its name to Thomas Cook AG.

It is derived from the Latin post illa verba textus (\\"after these words from Scripture\\"),Adams, G. W., Romans 1-8: General Introduction, Reformation Commentary on Scripture, 2019 referring to biblical readings. The word first occurs in the chronicle (with reference to examples of 1228 and 1238) of Nicolas Trivetus, but later it came to mean only homiletic exposition, and thus became synonymous with the homily in distinction from the thematic sermon. Finally, after the middle of the fourteenth century, it was applied to an annual cycle of homilies.Schaff-Herzog article. Early Lutheran postils From the time of Martin Luther, who published the first part of his postil under the title Enarrationes epistolarum et evangeliorum quas postillas vocant (Wittenberg, 1521), every annual cycle of sermons on the lessons, whether consisting of homilies or formal sermons, is termed a postil. A few of the most famous Lutheran postils are those of M. Luther (Kirchenpostille, Wittenberg, 1527; Hauspostille, 1542, 1549), P. Melanchthon (Evangelien- Postille, Germ., Nuremberg, 1549; Lat., Hanover, 1594), M. Chemnitz (Evangelien-Postille, Magdeburg, 1594), L. Osiander (Bauern-Postille, T√ºbingen, 1597), and J. Arndt (Evangelien-Postille, Leipzig, 1616). Catholic postils By 1530 postils were commonly used in Catholic preaching, at least in Germany.Frymire, p. 253; Google Books. The two (in Latin) by Thomas Stapleton proved popular.Frymire, p. 419; Google Books. Frymire has tabulated the development from 1520 (Catholic and Lutheran).Frymire, p. 454; Google Books. Later postils The term postil fell into disuse during the period of Pietism and the Enlightenment, but was revived by Claus Harms (Winter- Postille, Kiel, 1812; Sommer-Postille, 1815). It has again become common through W. L√∂he (Evangelien-Postille, Frommel 1848; Epistel-Postille, 1858), and M. Stuttgart (Herzpostille, Bremen, 1882, 1890; Hauspostille, 1887‚Äì88; Pilgerpostille, 1890). Reformed Churches, which disregard a regular series of lessons, have no postils; in the Roman Catholic Church the term has been kept, especially through Leonard Goffin√© (Hand-Postill oder christ-catholische Unterrichtungen von allen Sonn- and Feyr-Tagen des gantzen Jahrs (Mainz, 1690; popular, illustrated ed., reissued twenty-one times by H.

The Norwegian government-owned company Petoro has managed the SDFI portfolio since 2001. History and background The Norwegian government claims ownership of all resources on and under the sea in the geographical area known as the Norwegian continental shelf. The Norwegian government awards production licences to cooperating companies to find and produce petroleum in specific areas. The Norwegian government creates income from the petroleum sector through taxes and fees as well as itself being a participant in the industry. The Norwegian government initially participated in the industry through the creation and development of the state oil company Statoil. From 1973 to 1985 the government awarded Statoil 50% or more of Norway's petroleum development licenses. In the 1980s political discourse questioned this arrangement as Statoil's cash flow was becoming very large in relation to Norway's gross national product. The solution was splitting Statoil's ownership. SDFI was created on January 1, 1985, as a separate juridical entity managed by Statoil. Statoil's original ownership was divided in two, with approximately 20% retained by Statoil itself, and the rest given to SDFI. When Statoil was partially privatised in 2001 this solution was no longer desirable and a new state-owned management company Petoro was created to manage SDFI. The Norwegian government also reduced the size of SDFI by 20%, with 15% of the portfolio going to Statoil and 5% to Norsk Hydro. Values in SDFI Petoro is registered as owner for the states portions with permissions 93 licences. This also gives portions of production from 36 fields. The states portion of the total reserves on the Norwegian shelf are as of January 1, 2005 294 million Sm3 oil and 1005 mrd Sm3 natural gas. This represent 24% of the oil reserves and 41.6% of the natural gas reserves, and makes Petoro the largest licenceholder on the shelf. As of January 1, 2006 the value of SDFI was NOK 850 billion. The states portion of the oil production on the shelf was in 2004 about 46.6 million Sm3, 14% of the states reserves at the beginning of 2004. In 2016 the value of SDFI was estimated at 810 billion kroner. Fuel volumes The table below lists all remaining field reserves as of January 1, 2005 where the state by Petoro has ownerships in the production, with percent ownership in the field, crude oil listed in million standard cubic meters MSm3 and in million barrels that belong to the state, gass in billion standard cubic meters GSm3, Natural gas liquids in million tonnes, Natural gas condensate in MSm3 and the total of all remaining petroleum in the field given in million oil equivalents (oe).

Music Mikey Havoc is the lead singer of the New Zealand rock band Push Push, best known for its 1991 number one singles \\"What My Baby Likes\\" and \\"Trippin'\\". He is now a radio DJ. During the late 1990s he owned and managed The Squid nightclub in inner-city Auckland. Radio Roberts first became a radio DJ on the University of Auckland's 95bFM radio station in the early 1990s. He was on the breakfast show from 1996 to 2002, winning Best New Broadcaster at the 1997 New Zealand Radio Awards and later moved to the afternoon-evening \\"Drive\\" show. He once again took over as the breakfast show host on 4 September 2006, after previous host Wallace Chapman quit to pre-empt a suspected layoff. On 3 May 2010 Havoc returned to his Drive slot as Matt Heath took over the breakfast show. Havoc left the show on 3 December 2010. He returned to radio in 2012 on mainstream rock station Hauraki weeknights 7-10pm. Havoc returned to 95bFM from 8 May 2017 to 3 May 2019 for a third stint as breakfast show host. TV In the mid-nineties he moved into television on New Zealand's short lived MTV channel with the 30 minute live weekday night magazine style show Havoc with his Bfm co-worker Jeremy Wells. This show moved to TV 2 in an hour-long weekly format. He continued on TVNZ with the shows Havoc and Newsboy's Sell-out Tour and Havoc's Luxury Suites and Conference Facilities. During the Tour in 1999, he labelled Gore the gay capital of New Zealand (a claim proved false by the 2006 census) - the mayor of Gore was quoted in the news saying Havoc would be run out of town if he ever returned. In 2004 he moved to TV3 with Havoc Presents Quality Time.  Personal life  In early 2006, Havoc married New Zealand actress Claire Chitham of Shortland Street fame. They split in 2009.

Description  The magic/technology described in the story draws upon ideas from Buddhism, Taoism, ancient Japanese myth, elements of cyberpunk, Yin/Yang mysticism, and particle physics. The story is based on a minor empire within the expansive (25-world) Galactic Empire, known as Great Yamato Empire, located on a minor backwater world. Dealing with gods, end of world scenario and numbers of characters caught up in a universe shattering event. The Galaxy Empire spans 25 worlds and is connected by magic-powered starships. Masamune Shirow has combined many aspects of magic with technology. * Elements of cybernetic technology can be seen in use by warriors of the Great Yamato Empire. These warriors integrated with what appear oversize suits of armor which has human's arms and legs, pelvis removed and connected by series wires and tubes. Not all these armors require this, Commander Rommel remains wholly human. These Armor Knights besides wielding swords, staff like Halberds, as well magic wielding devices. These Armor Knights have limited flight abilities. * Starships: Seen in beginning of the story, Masamune Shirow has starships guided by human navigators which phase through time & space not unlike starships seen in the 1984 film Dune. The warships appear as Japanese warships of Middle Ages which have broadside armaments not unlike 18th-century warships. These vessels are normally seeing hovering or flying instead of lying in water. * Diagrams/Forums: These are large, circular mystic spells are used by characters of story. They can be used as explosive alarm clocks, summoning spells, magical controlling devices (such as NƒÅga Generator), as well as controlling starships. * NƒÅga Generator: This device was conceived through mixing science and mystic magic to collected all negative karma in the known universe to purify the Galaxy Empire. * Psychoscience: This is a mixture of science and mystism which gives one the power to wield magic on the level of the gods. However, science is needed to monitor and control this mix. It still being developed, thus prone to problems which are seen throughout the story.  Plot  The main plot revolves around the Yamata Empire's plan to destroy all the galaxy's negative karma using a massive technological reactor called the NƒÅga Generator. Unfortunately, negative karma cannot simply be destroyed, it must be atoned for. However, the leader of the powerful mystic Buddhist Fuze Clan plans to stop the destruction of the negative karma which will end up creating the nine-headed NƒÅga and destroy the world if not the whole universe. To help in stopping the creation of the NƒÅga, the clan summons Susano, the Shinto warrior god of Destruction. The powerful, arrogant, and homicidal god faces challenges. These include the Empire and the clan leader's own daughter, the bratty sorceress Seska, who is possessed by the power of negative Karma and a powerful magic formula. At the beginning, the Clan steals a secret magical formula which contains the power to control the NƒÅga. Fuze's leader, Ma√Ætre Fuzen, begins the ceremony when his rival, Dr. Hebime, leads troops to Fuza's shrine to arrest him and his clan. Seska, newly arrived from a starship, is nearly arrested herself and dashes ahead of the troops. She bumbles into the summoning ceremony, and is forced to \\"wear\\" the secret diagram to save it. Dr. Hebime and his troops arrives in time to kill Ma√Ætre Fuzen and his followers as they complete the summoning ceremony of warrior god Susano Orbatos. Susano warns the troops and is angry that he had no proper offerings. Seeing Seska with the diagram on her body, he swallows her whole. Dr. Hebine forces his troops to attack him and has military HQ fire powerful forbidden spells at Susano. The weapons strike him and disable him. This infuriates him further and he destroys the Fuze mountain temple as Hebine escapes. Susano resurrects Ma√Ætre Fuzen and has him witness what happens when a god is angered. He then goes on a rage destroying a good chunk of the capital city. Dr. Hebime summons Hanuman (the monkey god) who also fails to stop Susano. Susano and Ma√Ætre investigate the palace and discover that Princesse Kushinata is to be sacrificed to the NƒÅga Generator. They go and fight off the palace's defenses. Meanwhile, Seska is revived by the power of the negative karma and dedicates herself to avenge her father's death and to save her clan by gaining an audience with Emperor. By becoming a royal adviser to Emperor she begins to activate the NƒÅga Generator and uses the secret scroll which can banish Susano. Ultimately, the NƒÅga Generator is activated and both Susano and Seska clash. The NƒÅga Generator creates a monstrous nine- headed NƒÅga which becomes so bloated with Galactic Empire's negative Karma its becomes a planet-sized Octopus type NƒÅga. Seska, after beating up Susano, banishes him. As NƒÅga grows, she becomes fascinated in ruling the Galactic Empire itself. However, Susano returns, summoning himself, rendering Seska's ability to stop him useless. He enters the NƒÅga and finds the Princess at center of the generator holding the NƒÅga force together. He breaks her control of the NƒÅga and disrupts it. The giant NƒÅga splatters over the world like water, flooding it. The Great Yamato Empire (what is left of it), sinks under the waves with few survivors. Susano and the princess leave the mortal survivors of Empire behind wishing them luck. Seska is restored back to normal and is reunited with Commander Ronnel. What remains of Yamato Empire appears to become Japan and the world is, in fact, Earth. However, the story alludes that the NƒÅga will return. The fictional Yamata Empire is based on an expanded continent of what would become the Pacific Ocean, drawing from the ancient mythology of the continent of Mu.  Characters  * Susano Orbatos: God of Destruction, a powerful, wild, arrogant, homicidal divinity. * Seska: Bratty, beloved, egotistical, bumbling, a 1st Class Navigator sorceress aboard magical-powered starships.

The main morphostructural units are the Greater Caucasus, the Lesser Caucasus, the Gusar plane, the Samur-Devechi lowland, the Kur intermountain trough, the Karabagh volcanic highland, the near and middle Araz Ridges and Talysh Mountains. General information The Candy Cane Mountains near Altƒ±aƒüac. Azerbaijan is typified by relief of different kinds and complexity. Over 50% of the country's area consists of the mountain ridges, crests, yailas and plateaus rises up to hypsometric levels of 400-1000m, (including the Middle and Lower lowlands), in some places (Talish, Jeyranchol-Ajinohur and Langabiz- Alat foreranges) up to 100-120m, as well as 0-50m up (Gobustan, Absheron) the rest part of which are plains and lowlands. Hypsometric marks within the Caucasus region vary in the range from about -28m at the Caspian Sea shoreline up to 4466m at Mount Bazard√ºz√º. Quantitative distribution The quantitative area distribution of Azerbaijan according to the hypsometric levels is as following: * 18% is located below the Ocean level * 24% has hypsometric marks ranging from 0 to 200m * 15.5% is covered by areas which elevation ranges from 200 to 500m * 15.5% is covered by areas which elevation marks ranges from 500 to 1000m * 19.5% is covered by areas which elevation ranges from 1000 to 2000m high * 6.5% is covered by areas which elevation ranges from 2000 to 3000m * 1% is covered by areas which elevation marks are over 3000m high The average elevation is 384m high. Principle orographic units of Azerbaijan consists of the Caucasus mountain system, Samur-Davachi lowland (in conjunction with Gusar inclined plain), Kur River lowland, Minor Caucasus and Talish mountain systems. Caucasus mountains system The southeast part of the Caucasus mountain region is located within Azerbaijan. The basic orographic elements of this part of Caucasus system are Major Caucasus system or Watershed Ridge and the Lateral ridge. Major Caucasus ridge constitutes large portion of the Caucasus system and extends southeast off Tinov-Rosso elevation (3385m) is located at Azerbaijan border with Georgia and Dagestan. Major Caucasus Quba.|200px The Major Caucasus or Watershed Ridge is not crossed with any river valleys and therefore it is also called Watershed Ridge. Most part of the ridge elevation is over 3000m high, and only in its central part it exceeds 4000m height; which are: * Bazard√ºz√º - 4466m * Tufandagh - 4191m, * Bazaryurd - 4126m Beginning from Babadagh peak (located at 3629m, means \\"Father Mountain\\") the same ridge elevation gradually goes down and becomes wider. Starting from Dubrar elevation (2205m) Major Caucasus ridge plunges northeastward towards Caspian Sea like expanded fan having been cut by river valleys into separate ridges like Gadi-Kurkachidagh, Aladagh, Kemchi and others. Lateral Ridge The same ridges are further divided into smaller and lower ridges to pass into low elevation mountain region named Gobustan, and further on into Absheron Peninsula. North off and parallel to the Great Caucasus ridge there is a southeast trending ridge called Lateral, of which Azerbaijan section starts from the Shahdagh (located at 4243m, means \\"Kings Mountain\\") extending and getting lower southeastward and terminates at Beshbarmag (located at 546m, Besh Barmag Mountain means \\"Five Finger Mountain\\") pinnacle. The southeastern section of lateral Ridge Tengi- Beshbarmagh is a medium and low-altitude mountain erosion-denudation relief. The relief of this part is consist of the Jurassic and Cretaceous limestone and clay. Lateral ridge is divided into stand alone blocks-Plateaus (Shahdagh, Gizilgaya, Budugh, and others) by river valleys that begin from Great Caucasus ridge. Northwestern part of the Lateral Ridge matches up to the Shahdagh-Khizi geosyncline constituted of thick Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous dolomite limestone. They create a series of highland plateau with delimiting covered and steep slopes. Talabi-Gaynarja elevation Northeast off and parallel to the Lateral ridge there is Talabi-Gaynarja elevation, which elevation ranges from 1000-1100m in the west down to 150-200m in the east. Ridges and elevations are divided from each other by valleys and intermontane troughs (Shahnabad, Khinalyg, Erphee, Gonagcand, Kaltan, Gilgilchay,Tigchay, Rustov, Perebedil and others). Southern flank of the Great Caucasus ridge descended to Alazan-Ayrichay valley (in some sources Alazan-Haftaran valley, whereas in others it is considered as one of the Kur River valley parts) that in some places is parallel to the mentioned ridge. Said above valley begins from Georgia and is 210 km long and 30 km wide in Azerbaijan. Nialdagh ridge which elevation reaches up to 2100m high is extended parallel to the Great Caucasus one apart through Lahidge valley. They characterized by the middle-altitude mountain denudation relief.  Jeirankechmez depression  The depression is followed by linearly extended folded ridges and dome-shaped elevations substituting with wide synclinal valleys and constitutes in plan to the eastern part of the Shamakhy-Gobustan syncline. The northwestern section of the Jeyrankechmez corresponds to the topography of the Baku age alluvial- proluvial plain. The southeastern part of the depression characterized by younger abrasion-accretion marine plain and relief composed of the large brachyanticline elevations and broken by lengthwise ruptures. Mud volcanoes are typical for there. The depression is limited by the Alyat range and the Langebiz low-altitude mountain range from the south part. This section is consist of Paleogene, Miocene and Pliocene rocks.  Absheron peninsula  The South-Eastern Caucasus ends in Absheron peninsula and the western part bordering the Dubrar system. Yunusdagh, Ylkhydagh and Koun are the highest parts of the peninsula about 300‚Äì350 meters. The topography of northern area is hummock and hollow. Mud volcanoes are typical for this part and salt lakes are observed, too. There are Akhtarma, Lokbatan, Bozdagh mud volcanoes in the southwest part of the peninsula. Mud Volcano in Absheron peninsula The eastern part of the Absheron peninsula is flat with 38 meter maximal height. Bina, Govsan, Tyrkyan and Zirya are below the sea level. Oil and gas-bearing areas are typical for peninsula.  Lesser Caucasus  The Lesser Caucasus Mountain is less high and has a folded-boulder structure caused by the presence of abyssal fractures of transversal and longitudinal striking. The prominent elevations are Murguz, Murovdagh, Shakhdagh, Garabagh, Eastern Goycha and Mykhtekyan. Shakhdagh ridge consists of volcanic rocks and Upper Cretaceous, Eocene carbonate, and consistent to the same-name syncline. From northwestern part Shakhdagh Mountain of the Lesser Caucasus stripes to the southeastern Gilandagh Mountain and from this part joins Murovdagh. Gyamyshdagh Mountain is the highest point with 3724 meter height. Northeastern and northern sections of Shakhdagh and Murovdagh Ridge are composed of erosional spurs such as, Chyngldagh, Pant and Kalteke. Shakhdagh, Murovdagh and Eastern Goycha Ridge are followed by highlands and troughs. The riverside parts characterized by well-preserved peneplanation surfaces of the Early- Middle Miocene Oligocene, Middle Miocene and Late Pliocene ages. Eastern Goycha Ridge consists of Eocene, volcanic-sedimentary rocks and Miopliocene volcanogenic thickness. Ketidagh Mountain is the highest point of the ridge with 3399 meter height. The Garabagh Ridge enlarges in the central part of the Lesser Caucasus southeastern edge. The main peaks of Garabagh are Gyrkhgyz (2823 m), Boyuk Kirs (2725 m) and Ziyarat (2478 m).  Garabagh highland  The Garabagh highland is volcanic oriented and covers the southwestern of the Lesser Caucasus. Late Pliocene, Quaternary and Basaltic andesite lava outflows are typical for the relief of the highland.  Kur-Araz lowland  The lowland is covered by several sites which differs from one another according to their geological structures and orographic features and surrounded by Greater Caucasus and Lesser Caucasus Ridges. In the northern part of the Kur-Araz lowland Ganykh-Airichay synclinal valley extends and in the south of the valley covered by low-rise linearly monoclinic ridges Jeiranchel-Ajinour terrain. Miocene and Upper Pliocene argillo-arenaceous rocks are typical for the relief of terrain. Eastern part of the Jeiranchel-Ajinour terrain covered by rivers and they create antecedent valleys by crossing the low-hill. The lowland is divided into the Shirvan, Garabagh, Mughan, Mil and Salyan plains by the Kur and Araz river valleys. In the eastern part of the Kur-Araz lowland covered by the Large and Small Kharami, Mishovdagh. Between the southeastern lowland and Caspian seashore alluvial marine plain Shirvan is situated. The Kur-Araz lowland joins to the Lankaran lowland by the Mughan and Salyan plains in the south. Several elevations such as, ‚Äúgobu‚Äù, topographic shapes ‚Äúchala‚Äù as well as river-formed lakes called ‚Äúakhmaz‚Äù are typical for the lowland.  Talysh Mountains  Talysh Mountains The Talysh Mountains are considered as a continuation of the Lesser Caucasus and followed by Paleogene and Neogene volcanic deposits. Furthermore, southeastern part of the mountains composed of the Late Cretaceous deposits. Compared with the Greater and Lesser Caucasus glacial landforms are not particular in Talysh Mountains. The prominent ridges in Talysh Mountains are Talysh, Peshtasar, Dizgoni and Burovar Ridges. The highest point is Kemyurkei Mountain with 2493 meters situated in Talysh Ridge. Northwest section composed of the middle and upper Miocene deposits. Between the Caspian Sea and Talysh Mountains is situated the Lankaran depression and the flat lowland seaside is below the sea level. The lowland consists of the river descending sediments.

McNeal was born and raised in Atmore, Alabama. He is a 1976 graduate of Escambia County (Alabama) High School where he was a star on the football team. He played college football at the University of Alabama for the legendary coach Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant. McNeal played on Alabama's 1978 and 1979 national championship teams; he was Captain of the Team in 1979. In 1992, he was selected as a member of the University of Alabama All-Centennial Team. McNeal's most famous play at Alabama was in the 1979 Sugar Bowl. In the final period, with Alabama leading Penn State 14-7, the Nittany Lions had the ball deep in Alabama territory first and goal at the 8-yard line. On second down, Penn State quarterback Chuck Fusina hit receiver Scott Fitzkee on a crossing route and Fitkee appeared headed for the goal line marker for a touchdown. However, McNeal was able to run down Fitzkee and force him out of bounds at the one- yard line, being knocked unconscious in the process. Two plays later on 4th down, Alabama linebacker Barry Krauss stopped Penn State running back Mike Guman short of the goal line in a now-famous goal-line stand. The Miami Dolphins drafted McNeal as a defensive back in 1980. McNeal played in two Super Bowls with the Dolphins: Super Bowl XVII in January 1983 and Super Bowl XIX in January 1985. He retired at the end of the 1989 season having played his entire pro career with the Dolphins. McNeal was involved in one of the more famous plays in the annals of professional football, which took place in Super Bowl XVII. Late in the game with fourth down and inches to go, McNeal was unable to bring down Washington Redskins running back John Riggins, who rumbled 43 yards into the endzone for the game-winning touchdown. On the play, McNeal was assigned to shadow Redskins tight end Clint Didier, who went in motion before the snap. Suddenly, Didier reversed his motion, and McNeal slipped as he changed direction before regaining his footing. This slippage caused McNeal to start late in his pursuit of Riggins on the play after the snap, and while he got his hands on Riggins, he was unable get a firm grip as Riggins shed the tackle easily before scoring. Riggins' Run is the Redskins' \\"Greatest Moment of all time\\" as voted on by Redskin fans. This became not only a famous play but also a famous photograph as well. Today, McNeal is active in the community with associations that assist youth and adults. He serves as a drug-rehab counselor, teacher, coach, lay pastor, board member, and is a frequent public speaker. He is a pastor at New Testament Baptist Church in South Florida and speaker for Power Talent.

As a player, he made nearly 500 Football League appearances for five clubs between 1972 and 1989. As a manager, he had a highly successful spell in charge of Cambridge United in the early 1990s, when he guided the club to two successive promotions and two successive quarter-final appearances in the FA Cup. Beck took the club from the Fourth Division to the Second and very nearly to the new Premier League at the end of the 1991‚Äì92 season, where they ended their campaign fifth in the Second Division, their highest ever league finish.. In 2010, he was appointed manager of Conference National club Histon, but resigned two games into the 2010‚Äì11 season. Career Beck started his playing career at Queens Park Rangers signing in May 1972 and made his debut in the 3‚Äì1 win against Leyton Orient in December 1972. Beck was unable to hold down a regular place in the immensely successful QPR side of the mid 1970s, competing with England captain Gerry Francis and Scottish international Don Masson for the creative midfield role. In 1976, the year that QPR finished second to Liverpool in the First Division, he moved to Coventry City after playing 40 league games for Rangers, scoring once. The 1977‚Äì78 season saw John Beck playing in what was arguably Coventry's most exciting top-flight team of all time. Gordon Milne's side containing Tommy Hutchison, Mick Ferguson, Ian Wallace, Terry Yorath, Graham Oakey, Bobby MacDonald and Jim Blyth played scintillating attacking football that swept many teams aside, often by large margins of victory, although they failed to win any silverware or qualify for the UEFA Cup. He later played for Fulham, Bournemouth and finally joined Cambridge United in July 1986. Beck's career was ended by injury in 1989, and he was appointed assistant manager at Cambridge. Following the resignation of Chris Turner he was appointed manager January 1990, with Cambridge mid table in the Fourth Division. In his first season United won the Fourth Division playoffs, and reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup - a rare achievement for a Fourth Division side. The following season (1990‚Äì91) they won the Third Division title after an excellent finish to the season saw them climb from 10th to top in less than three months, and they repeated the feat of reaching the FA Cup quarter-finals. During the Summer, Beck turned down the opportunity to manage Leicester City, saying he wanted to take the club all the way to the First Division. In fact he very nearly achieved this, as in 1991‚Äì92 they finished 5th in the Second Division, the highest position ever achieved by the club, but lost to Leicester City in the play-off semi-finals, ending their hopes of a third successive promotion (something which has still yet to be achieved in the English Football League) and denying them the chance of becoming Premier League founder members. Beck's long ball playing style, despite its success, was heavily criticised in the media, and by fans and managers of other clubs, particularly Glenn Hoddle then of Swindon Town. Their style of play was similar to that of Wimbledon, who had climbed from the Fourth Division to the First in four seasons leading up to 1986, staying there for 14 years and winning an FA Cup just two seasons after promotion. However, he remained popular with United fans for the success that he brought the club. He also oversaw many unorthodox developments at the club, including the tactical repositioning of the away team dugout, ensuring the grass around the corner area was longer so as to slow the ball down when played in that part of the pitch, and the practice of throwing buckets of cold water over players before a match. The club made a poor start to the 1992‚Äì93 season, and Beck was dismissed in October 1992, marking the start of a sharp decline for the club; Cambridge ended the season relegated from the new Division One and just two years after that they fell into Division Three. That summer, he had sold top scorer Dion Dublin to Manchester United for ¬£1million - although the player spent just two seasons at Old Trafford, he played top flight football for more than a decade and was capped four times by England. Other successful players to appear under Beck at Cambridge included striker Steve Claridge (who scored Leicester City's promotion-clinching goal in the 1996 Division One playoff final and the winning goal in their League Cup triumph a year later), and defenders Alan Kimble (who played seven seasons in the Premier League after joining Wimbledon) and Gary Rowett (who went on to play for four different clubs in the Premier League). He made a quick comeback with Preston North End, joining the club on 7 December 1992 with the club in danger of relegation from Division 2 (now League 1). Over the next few months Beck brought in many players, implemented his preferred long ball style of play and got the players to wear tracksuit bottoms under their shorts for better protection on the hard plastic pitch. There was a slight improvement in results and a noted improvement in attendances. However the club then lost its last five matches to suffer relegation to Division 3 (now League 2).Rigby, Ian and Mike Payne (1999) \\"Proud Preston\\", Carnegie Publishing, p280 The following season in Division 3 saw another large turnover of players and a major promotion push. One of the players recruited in September 1993 was centre half David Moyes who later managed the club at the start of a long and successful managerial career. The club lost to Torquay United in the first leg of the Play Offs in 1994 but then won 4-1 after extra time in the second leg (the last ever match on the plastic pitch) to reach the Play Off Final at Wembley. Beck surprisingly replaced experienced centre half Stuart Hicks with youngster Jamie Squires for the Final and despite leading 2‚Äì1 at one stage they were ultimately beaten 4-2 by Wycombe Wanderers.Rigby, Ian and Mike Payne (1999) \\"Proud Preston\\", Carnegie Publishing, p283 The 1994‚Äì1995 season started quite well for Preston but from September the club went on a run of seven successive League defeats. Despite a slight improvement Beck left Deepdale at the end of November 1994 and was replaced by his assistant Gary Peters who took the club to the Play Offs at the end of the season and ultimate promotion in 1996.Rigby, Ian and Mike Payne (1999) \\"Proud Preston\\", Carnegie Publishing, p288 Beck's next stop was at Lincoln City in 1995. They won automatic promotion to Division Two in 1998, but Beck had been controversially sacked just weeks earlier. In 1999, Beck teamed up with Shane Westley, his former assistant at Lincoln City and joined Barrow in a short lived advisory role. Beck returned to Cambridge in March 2001, and kept them in Division Two, but he resigned the following November with relegation looking increasingly likely. After a short period out of football, Beck became assistant manager to Steve Fallon at Histon, in what proved to be the most successful period in the club's history as the club rose from the lower leagues up to the Conference National. The club even came close to being promoted to the Football League in the 2008‚Äì09 season, but missed out following a 2‚Äì1 aggregate defeat to Torquay Utd in the play-offs. In September 2009 however, Beck was sacked from the club after a fall-out with Fallon. Beck once again remained out of football until 21 May 2010, when he returned to Histon as manager, after Fallon himself had been sacked in January of that year, and interim manager Alan Lewer declined to apply for the job on a permanent basis. However, Beck resigned from the club on 19 August, following a league defeat away to AFC Wimbledon. Beck was appointed manager of Evo-Stik Southern Premier League club Kettering Town on 18 June 2012. However, he parted company with the club in September 2012.

The first tropical cyclone, first named storm, and first hurricane on the season, Abby developed over the northwestern Caribbean Sea on June 1, as a result of the interaction between a mid-tropospheric trough and a cold front. Moving generally north-northeastward, the depression slowly strengthened while approaching the western tip of Cuba, becoming Tropical Storm Abby late on June 2\\\\. Shortly thereafter, Abby made landfall in Pinar del R√≠o Province. The storm dropped heavy rainfall in western Cuba, with up to on Isla de la Juventud. However, no flooding was reported. After reaching the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on June 3, Abby strengthened further and became a Category 1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. However, early on June 4, Abby weakened to a tropical storm. Around midday on June 4, the system made landfall near Punta Gorda, Florida as a strong tropical storm. Initially, Abby weakened slightly after moving inland, but then maintained intensity while tracking slowly eastward across Florida. By midday on June 5, the system emerged into the Atlantic Ocean, but made another landfall near Atlantic Beach late on June 6\\\\. The storm weakened slowly weakened and fell to tropical depression intensity over eastern Georgia about 24 hours later. Abby then moved in a parabolic path across The Carolinas, eventually re-emerging into the Atlantic from South Carolina early on June 11\\\\. By late on the following day, Abby made another landfall near Swansboro, North Carolina. The storm moved offshore again on June 13, before finally dissipating near the Delmarva Peninsula. Abby's slow movement produced heavy rains across Florida and the Southeastern United States which caused 6 indirect fatalities and $450,000 dollars (1968 USD, $3 million 2013 USD) in damage. Meteorological history A mid-tropospheric trough persisted over the western Caribbean Sea in late May. Around that time, a short-wave trough moving eastward through the Caribbean Sea forced a cold front to move southward into the Straits of Florida. Satellite imagery indicated that the cold front and mid-tropospheric trough began merging as the low-level convergence field increased. Thereafter, barometric pressures in the western Caribbean were decreasing as deep southwesterly flow caused very warm and moist air to enter the area. At 0600 UTC on June 1, the system developed into Tropical Depression One, while situated about northeast of Guanaja, Honduras. When a weak cold front moved into the area, it generated convection, gaining enough organization to be called a tropical depression on June 1. The initial circulation was not embedded within the convection, but as it moved slowly north-northeastward, it was able to strengthen and become better organized, reaching tropical storm strength on the 2nd. It crossed the western tip of Cuba, and upon reaching the southeast Gulf of Mexico Abby achieved hurricane strength. Abby then reached a peak intensity 75 mph (121 km/h) and before weakening back to tropical storm strength.National Hurricane Center (1968) 1968 Monthly Weather Review URL Accessed: September 20, 2006 Abby soon made landfall as a tropical storm near Punta Gorda, Florida on the 4th, and moved across the state. Once it reached the western Atlantic, building high pressure to its east forced Abby northwestward. On the 6th, it again reached the Florida coast, this time near Jacksonville. Abby weakened to a tropical depression as it moved over Georgia, and over the next 6 days, it wandered around the Carolinas, finally dissipating on the 13th east of Virginia. The remnants of Abby were absorbed by a cold front the same day. Preparations At 2200 UTC on June 2, the Weather Bureau posted a gale warning from south of Tampa Bay to Melbourne on the east coast, including the Florida Keys and Lake Okeechobee. Around 1600 UTC on June 3, the National Hurricane Center began issuing tropical storm warnings from Marco Island to Tarpon Springs, Florida, while gale warnings were extended northward to Cedar Key. After about 24 hours, the hurricane warning was discontinued. Simultaneously, the gale warning area was revised to include from Venice to Tarpon Springs on the west coast and from Palm Beach to Jacksonville on the east coast. Late on June 4, gale warnings on the west coast of Florida were discontinued. The gale warning was changed to a storm warning from Melbourne to Jacksonville late on June 5\\\\. Simultaneously, a hurricane watch was posted for the same areas. The remaining portion of the gale warning, south of Melbourne, was discontinued at 1000 UTC on June 6\\\\. Around that time, the storm warning and hurricane watch were extended further north to Charleston, South Carolina. Six hours later, the hurricane watch was discontinued for areas south of Daytona Beach, Florida. At 1900 UTC on June 6, the storm warning was discontinued at and south of St. Augustine, Florida, while the entire hurricane watch was canceled. Three hours later, the storm warning was condensed to include only Fernandina Beach, Florida to Charleston. The storm warning was canceled south of Savannah, Georgia at 1000 UTC on June 7. Four hours later, the remaining storm warning, from Savannah to Charleston, was discontinued. In May, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) scheduled a mock preparation session for the 1968 Atlantic hurricane season. However, as Abby approached, the USACE was faced with a real threat. About 100 men from the Clewiston area filled and placed sand bags around Lake Okeechobee and secure equipment. Additionally, other residents were warned of potential evacuation procedures. In Hillsborough County, about 30 schools were listed as available for shelters. On June 4, military personnel from McCoy Air Force Base were evacuated to Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. Tanker planes of the 306th and 909th squadrons were diverted to Loring Air Force Base in Maine while other air squadrons were placed on alert.U.S. Air Force Arc Light/Young Tiger - Unit Augmentation URL Accessed: September 20, 2006 Impact Rainfall totals from Hurricane Abby. In Cuba, Abby dropped 12 inches (305 mm) of rain in Isle of Pines and wind gusts up to 50 mph were reported. There were no reports of damage or fatalities from Abby's impact on Cuba. Abby dropped 4-8 inches (102-203 mm) of rain across southern and western Florida. The highest rainfall total was in Hart Lake.David Roth (2009-02-15) Hurricane Abby - June 2-13, 1968.

Four tornadoes were reported during Abby's landfall. Two of which caused $8,000 dollars (1968 USD) in damage in Florida. Six fatalities resulted from drowning, electrocutions and traffic accidents were reported during the storms landfall. In all, damage in Florida by Abby amounted to $250,000 (1968 USD). The rainfall was beneficial in Florida, as it aided in ending a drought in the state. Two tornadoes in Florida were spawned in association with Abby, both on June 4. One was near the Indian River in Brevard County at 6:30pm EDT. No injuries were reported and damage was estimated at less than $5,000 worth of damage. The second tornado touched down in Polk County at around 9:30pm EDT. It resulted in no injuries and caused less than $500 dollars in damage.

While there was certainly a Signalman rating before World War II (the Signalman rating is one of the oldest in the Navy), a specialized Signalman rating was established shortly after the war. Then, Signalmen were identified by the symbol of two crossed semaphore flags on the left sleeve of the uniform, integrated with their rank insignia. Signalmen were responsible for transmitting, receiving, encoding, decoding, and distributing messages obtained via the visual transmission systems of flag semaphore, visual Morse code, and flaghoist signalling. The U.S. Navy disestablished the rating of Signalman in late 2003, reassigning visual communications duties to the Quartermaster rating.

United Nations Treaty Series, vol 6, pp 143‚Äì175 PDF The treaty concerned the sovereignty and independence of the Arab state of Transjordan, which would now be known as the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan with Emir Abdullah I as its king. However, Britain would still maintain military bases within the country and continue to subsidize and support the Arab Legion. The Treaty of London superseded the former Anglo-Transjordan mandate known as the Organic Law of 1928. This former mandate liberalised several restrictions on Transjordan, however Great Britain still controlled financial matters and most foreign policy issues. It was then considered a step towards future independence. Transjordan's impending independence was recognised on 18 April 1946 by the League of Nations during the last meeting of that organisation. On 25 May 1946 the Transjordan became the \\"Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan\\" when the ruling 'Amir' was re-designated as 'King' by the parliament of Transjordan on the day it ratified the Treaty of London. 25 May is still celebrated as independence day in Jordan although officially the mandate for Transjordan ended on 17 June 1946 when in accordance with the Treaty of London the ratifications were exchanged in Amman and Transjordan gained full independence. When King Abdullah applied for membership in the newly formed United Nations, his request was vetoed by the Soviet Union, citing that the nation was not \\"fully independent\\" of British control. This resulted in another treaty in March 1948 with Britain in which all restrictions on sovereignty were removed. Despite this, Jordan was not a full member of the United Nations until 14 December 1955.

Speak started his playing career at Limavady United in 1982 before transferring to Ballymena United in 1983 where he was top scorer with 11 league goals. He then signed for Dundalk and made his League of Ireland debu on 16 September 1984. After one season he moved back to Ballymena where in 2 seasons he was their top scorer. He joined Derry City in August 1987. He was the 1987‚Äì88 League of Ireland Premier Division top scorer with 24 goals. Six of these goals came in one game in a 7‚Äì2 win over Sligo in April 1988. www.irishtimes.com Speak also helped Derry to a domestic treble in the 1988‚Äì89 season. After 5 years at the Brandywell he moved back to Ballymena. In the 1993/94 season he again topped their scorers chart with 13 league goals. He moved back to the League of Ireland to join Finn Harps in August 1994 for ¬£14,000. He led the Harps gallop to promotion in 1995‚Äì96, scoring 17 goals that season. Indeed, he was the club's top scorer for the next three seasons. Speak played 209 times for Harps in all competitions and scored 81 goals, 64 league goals in 152 matches. He also scored the winner in the 1999 FAI Cup semi-final in Terryland Park against Galway to send Harps to their first Cup Final in 25 years and scored again in one of the FAI Cup Final replays in Tolka Park.www.rte.ie When Gavin Dykes took over the managerial reins from Charlie McGeever in 2000, he appointed Speak as his assistant. Speak was also manager of a very talented Harps Under 21 team at the time. When Dykes resigned after an abysmal run of games that left Harps rooted to the bottom of the Premier table, Speak took over as caretaker, if somewhat reluctantly. He took Harps on an amazing unbeaten run of 14 games only to be cruelly relegated on the last day of the season. He took on the position of player-manager on a permanent position the following season (2001/02), which would see only the champions of the First Division gain automatic promotion. Drogheda United would win the league, again on the last day of the season as Harps finished second. They faced Longford Town in the playoffs and after a one nil defeat away in Flancare Park, Harps produced one of their best displays in Finn Park since the '70s. They went one down early in the first half but they battled like warriors with Kevin McHugh scoring a superb hat-trick. Unfortunately it wasn't to be as Speak conceded an injury time penalty in extra time and Harps were then beaten on penalties. The following season saw Waterford United make all the running to go up as champions and once more Harps had to settle for runners-up spot and a place in the playoffs which was abruptly ended by Galway United in the semi-final. Speak did lead Harps to lift their first national silverware in 28 years beating Kildare County 4‚Äì0 on aggregate in the final of the First Division Cup in September 2002. The 2003 season would be the first to be played in the calendar year. Speak started what would be his third and final season as Harps manager and in August Harps were sitting top of the league. With Dublin City, Kildare County and Bray Wanderers all pushing hard for the coveted top spot and automatic promotion, there was to be little room for error. Unfortunately three points from twelve in Harps last four games, including a home defeat to Sligo and a draw in Finn Park against leaders Dublin City left Harps in fourth place and five points off the pace.

The channel was formerly known as Electric Area (2008‚Äì2018) and before that Area (2002‚Äì2008 via Sirius) and its XM Radio counterpart The Move (2001‚Äì2008). The channel is being programmed by musician/producer/DJ/remixer Diplo and named after his 2013 song \\"Revolution.\\" The channel made its debut at 9pm (EDT) on March 22, 2018.\\"Diplo Launching His Own SiriusXM Channel (EXCLUSIVE)\\" from Variety (March 14, 2018)  Station history   As \\"Area\\"/\\"Electric Area\\"  The station was available on Sirius, and at first was called Area 63 due to the channel's position. Later, it was renamed Area 33, again due to the channel's then-new position. Area features some of the world's most renowned DJs such as Ti√´sto, Armin van Buuren, Dash Berlin, Carl Cox, Erik Morillo, Paul Van Dyk, Benny Benassi, Armand Van Helden, Roger Sanchez, Ferry Corsten, Thomas Gold, Serge Devant, Deep Dish, Annie Mac, Sasha and John Digweed. On June 24, 2008, Area 33 was moved to channel 38 to make room for the move of SIRIUS Disorder (occupying the position is now The Bridge). On November 12, 2008, Area dropped its \\"38\\" position on the logo because of the Sirius-XM merger, and replaced The Move on the XM channel lineup. Most recently, Mediabase delisted the S038-FM channel's playlist, along with co-owned Pop2K; Mediabase would read the station to its Dance panel in January 2014. On September 12, 2010, the channel was renamed Electric Area to expand its exclusive dance music format.  As \\"Diplo's Revolution\\"  On March 22, 2018 Electric Area was replaced with \\"Diplo's Revolution\\". It was announced at the launch that the channel would feature \\"global, hip-hop, experimental and underground dance culture\\"https://blog.siriusxm.com/diplo-to-launch-his-own- exclusive-siriusxm-channel-with-live-dj-set-for-siriusxm-subscribers/ aside from the current dance/electronica direction, as well as live sets and live festival broadcasts. The transition also resulted in sister channel BPM incorporating most of the content into its playlist. Despite success after a year on the airwaves, Diplo's Revolution has not been able to sway loyal followers of the Electric Area format it has fully replaced. The Electric Area listeners also cite Diplo's Revolution as a far cry from the pop EDM/Dance that was played on electric area, and describe Diplo's underground style of tribal jungle drum beats as \\"hard to follow\\" and feature strange rap lyrics mixed in. Diplo's Revolution features artists such as Dillon Francis and Phantoms, and maintains episodes of trance producer Armin Van Buuren's long running popular trance program A State of Trance. As of 2020, Diplo‚Äôs Revolution has begun to follow a more Top 40-like approach similar to sister channel BPM, as reflected in its playlists as reported in Billboard‚Äôs Dance/Mix Show Airplay and Mediabase‚Äôs Dance charts.

The station is operated by Sirius XM Radio and is classified under the \\"Dance/Electronic\\" category. The channel was originally known as The Strobe from 2002 to 2011, when it was relaunched under its current incarnation, an homage to the New York City discoth√®que Studio 54. On November 12, 2008, The Strobe was eliminated from the Sirius lineup as a result of the Sirius/XM channel lineup reorganization. On December 16, due to subscriber demand, Sirius XM Radio announced that the channel would be reactivated on January 15, 2009. On January 15, 2009, The Strobe returned to the Sirius lineup and made its debut on XM (on XM83, where the similarly-formatted Chrome had been prior to the November 2008 channel realignment). On May 28, 2010 through noon on June 1, 2010, Beach Party Radio replaced The Strobe for the Memorial Day Weekend. On July 1, 2010 though July 7, 2010 at 3 AM ET, Beach Party Radio again replaced The Strobe for the July 4th weekend. On September 3, 2010 at 9 AM, Beach Party Radio replaced The Strobe until Tuesday, September 7, 2010. On October 22, 2010 at 6 PM ET, \\"The Strobe\\" was removed from satellite broadcasts and will now only be heard online. It was replaced with Pearl Jam Radio, a channel playing the music of the band Pearl Jam. The last song on \\"The Strobe\\" before the change took effect was \\"Last Dance\\" by Donna Summer. On August 15, 2011, Studio 54 Radio premiered. Studio 54, unlike The Strobe, focuses on deeper disco cuts, rare mixes, and club classics. Much like Sirius XM's other themed channels, Studio 54 Radio is based entirely around the Studio 54 theme and era. It features testimonials, talk shows, and live mixes from former employees and DJs of the nightclub. On May 8, 2013, Sirius XM moved Studio 54 Radio from channel 15 to channel 54, putting it in line with the Sirius XM Dance channel line up and with its channel position to better match its branding. It can also be heard on Dish Network channel 6054 (Hopper channel 99-54). On August 4, 2016, Sirius XM expanded the format presentation of Studio 54 Radio to include Dance hits from the 1990s and 2000s due to the supposed elimination of Utopia when it moved to online only/modern SiriusXM Radios, although Utopia continues to become available as part of SiriusXM‚Äôs XTRA offerings.\\"Sirius XM To Make Channel Changes August 4\\" from Radioinsight (July 21, 2016) The current channel description reads: > Studio 54 Radio is the Ultimate Classic Dance Experience.

History On January 25, 1930, President Herbert Hoover asked Congress to re-appropriate an additional $100,000 for the main school building for the Air Corps Tactical School at Maxwell Field. President Hoover's policy was to speed public works to offset unemployment. In February 1930 Congressman J. Lister Hill's resolution was passed in the House of Representatives, to add to Maxwell Field for expansion purposes. The bill carried an item for $100,000 for construction of a tactical school building with a total sum available of $136,000. The actual cost of the building ended up being $132,034.14. The construction of Austin Hall George B. Ford and Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. designed the overall layout of Maxwell for the Army Quartermaster Corps. Ford, an architect-trained city planner who had served as an adviser to the Army in the 1920s on all of its base construction projects, and had final approval of all post development plans between 1926 and 1930, used an approach that clustered similar functions together. This technique provided plenty of open space and gave each cluster a distinct appearance. Construction plans were approved by Chief of the Air Corps Maj. Gen. James Fechet and Congressman Hill for a school house of approximately constructed of hollow tile and stucco, tile roof and walls with a white stucco finish. The expected operational date of the building was July 1931. On September 15, 1930, Congressman Hill broke ground for the project. Rain forced abandonment of the outdoor ceremonies that were intended to mark the start of the project. Congressman Hill along with other national and local area dignitaries and post commander Major Weaver hurriedly transferred the ceremonies to the Maxwell Field officer's club. Congressman Hill, the principal speaker, announced at the ceremony that the project was to be completed in 300 days at an approximate cost of $119,273. Hill also announced that for the tactical school program there was $1,903,400 available of which $1,703,400 was to be spent on buildings. The remaining $200,000 was to be used for the appropriation of additional land. Hill added that he expected an additional $375,000 more for buildings with another $1,300,200 to be added soon afterward. Algernon Blair is credited for being the architect and A.C. Samford was the contractor for the construction project. There were complaints about using imported labor; on April 4, 1931, Captain M. A. McFadden who was in charge of construction said at a local Rotary Club meeting that ninety percent of the labor employed in the construction was local labor. Montgomery area residents were understandably protective of all employment opportunities during this time period; the payroll of workers at Maxwell Field exceeded $2,000 daily. Austin Hall opens The first Air Corps Tactical School class at Maxwell Field in 1931 By August 28, 1931, sixty-four officers with spouses and other family members started to arrive at Maxwell Field in preparation of the grand opening of the school house. The school house was built in the Renaissance Revival style of architecture. Elements of this style were borrowed from fifteenth century Italian Renaissance merchant palaces and public buildings. The school house's hipped roof, corner quoins, and classical entrance gave the feeling of both formality and elegance. On September 4, 1931, the school house (Building 800) was formally dedicated in honor of First Lieutenant Charles B. Austin. Austin was an instructor at the Air Corps Tactical School when the school was at Langley Field. Lieutenant Austin was born in Vermillion Grove, Illinois, on January 7, 1891. Austin had graduated from DePauw University in 1913. He was scholastically outstanding to the point where he was selected for a membership in Phi Beta Kappa. On October 11, 1917 he enlisted as a flying cadet and attended ground school as a cadet at the University of Illinois. He received his flight training at Rich and Ellington Fields in Houston, Texas. On March 30, 1918, Austin received his commission in the aviation section of the Signal Officers Reserve Corps and was promoted to first lieutenant in the regular army July 1, 1920. Austin served in England, Mitchel Field, New York, France Field, the Panama Canal Zone and Langley Field. First Lieutenant Austin served with distinction at Langley Field as an instructor at the Air Corps Tactical School and received a letter of commendation for his efforts. On July 27, 1928, Lieutenant Austin died following illness and a subsequent operation. Major John F. Curry, commandant of the Air Corps Tactical School, thought all personnel associated with the school would profit by the example Austin set. Maxwell's continuous growth On July 16, 1933, Congressman Lister Hill secured approval from the War Department for $1,650,075 for immediate spending at Maxwell Field. Hill's request was justified by increased enrollment at the Air Corps Tactical School and the desperate need for employment for the local Montgomery population. At the start of October 1933 bids opened for four construction projects that were to start immediately (1933-1934 construction at Maxwell Field employed an average of 500 plus workers). The contract for the addition to Austin Hall was the last to be resolved. Bidding opened for the contract to construct Austin Hall on January 16, 1934. On January 18, it was announced that the Algernon Blair Company of Montgomery had received the contract. Construction started on the project after the Air Corps Tactical School 1933-34 session closed in June. Blair made all of his company assets available to ensure the project was finished by the fall. On September 5, Austin Hall was officially turned over to the Army Air Corps by the Algernon Blair Company; even though some areas of the building had been in use since August 31. The addition more than doubled the size of the original building to . The final cost for the construction for the additions to the south and front ends of the original structure was $107,627. Because of the additions to Austin Hall it would not only include classrooms but also be the new staff headquarters for the ACTS. The additions included executive offices, classrooms and assembly halls; a library was located in the extreme southern tip of the building. Modern-day Austin Hall As of July 8, 1940, Austin Hall was home to the headquarters of the Southeast Air Corps Training Center. The Southeast Air Corps Training Center was responsible for all pilot, navigator and bombardier training in the southeast. At one time during World War II the headquarters in Austin Hall controlled 30 plus major installations and 23 war service training organizations. Command jurisdiction for the Southeast Air Corps Training Center extended from Maine to Florida and from the Atlantic coast to the Mississippi River valley. By the end of World War II more than 100,000 aviation cadets had received training from the Southeast Air Corps Training Center. Historical status On April 2, 1988, Austin Hall was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The period of significance for the placement of Austin Hall on the register was 1925‚Äì1949. The historical significance of Austin Hall's placement on the register was the movement of the ACTS as well as Austin Hall's rich history through 1949. Moreover, the Algernon Blair Company and Samford Brother's Inc. involvement for Architecture/Engineering are noted for their significant effort.

A ball-up (pl. ball-ups) in Australian rules football describes a method of restarting play at a neutral contest after a stoppage within the field of play. It is not to be confused with a boundary throw-in which occurs in most cases when the ball is forced out of bounds. Ball-ups may be considered to be the equivalent of a jump ball, faceoff or dropped-ball. Historically they were performed in most cases by a field umpire throwing the ball firmly into the ground such that it bounces directly upwards several metres into the air. They are also known as bouncedowns. The Australian Football League amended the rules prior to the 2013 season to instruct the umpires to only bounce the ball at the start of each quarter and after a goal is scored, and throw the ball vertically upwards at all other times. Previously throw-ups were only used if ground conditions did not allow for the ball to be bounced effectively, or after a bounced ball-up is poorly executed and recalled (skewing in such a way that only one of the competing ruckmen is able to contest the ball). The skill of being able to bounce an oblong shaped ball vertically upwards on a grass surface is unique to Australian Football and the difficulty has been blamed for deterring some from becoming umpires. The ball-up executed in the centre circle at the beginning of each quarter and after each goal is known specifically as the centre bounce. Centre bounces are contested by one nominated ruckman from each team, who attempts to direct the ball to a teammate. Ball-ups can also occur at other locations around the ground. Umpires often have to decide whether a player tackled while in possession of the ball had a prior opportunity to pass the ball before they were tackled; if so, they will pay a free kick for holding the ball. If there was no such opportunity, then the umpire will call for a ball-up. Ball-ups are also frequently called when players from both teams scramble for a loose ball and neither can clearly secure possession. Before 2017, ball-ups which were not centre bounces, other players were allowed to help their ruckman in the contest by unexpectedly entering the contest and becoming the third man up. This was banned in 2017. From 1907 until 2018, a ball-up is also called if the player executing a kick-in stepped outside the goal square before kicking the ball back into play following a behind. In these cases, the ball-up was called at the top of the goal square. This rule was removed in 2019, replaced with the automatic calling of play on.

She is known for her hit single \\"Body Rock\\", which reached #8 on the US Dance Charts, #48 on the Hot 100, #5 on the Springbok Charts in South Africa, and #11 in the UK, and charted on various international charts. It was the theme song to the film Body Rock in 1984. The song is considered a dance classic. Career Early life Vidal was born to parents of Hispanic heritage. Sometime later, she met Desmond Child and the two began writing songs and started a music career. Despite these, she still worked at a diner for extra income. Due to her slight physical resemblance to actress and photographer Gina Lollobrigida, her co-workers, as well as the diner's owner and manager, nicknamed her as Gina. This will later be one critical element that inspired Child and members of the rock band Bon Jovi write the song \\"Livin' on a Prayer\\".  Early career (1977‚Äì1980)  Vidal was a founding member of the New York City-based band, Desmond Child & Rouge. They released two well- received albums in 1979 and 1980 for Capitol Records. They toured the country and were the musical guests on Saturday Night Live. Their iconic hit \\"Our Love is Insane\\" was their own particular blend of rock and disco. The band is known for their inclusion on the soundtrack to The Warriors in 1979, with the song \\"Last of an Ancient Breed\\". Vidal, as a member of Rouge along with Diana Grasselli and Myriam Valle, was asked by Paul Schaffer (the band's keyboardist), to sing on a live comedy album that he was the musical director on for Gilda Radner. While making the album, Radner and producer Lorne Michaels, decided instead to turn it into a Broadway show: Gilda Radner ‚Äì Live From New York opened at the Winter Garden Theater in the summer of 1979. Rouge performed as musicians as well as a variety of characters on stage. They toured Boston and Chicago, where the performances were made into the film Gilda Live directed by Mike Nichols.  Solo career  When the band parted ways, her first solo endeavor was an album with EMI, where she worked with producer John \\"Jellybean\\" Benitez. While working on the album, she was asked to sing the theme song for the 1984 film Body Rock, produced by Phil Ramone. It became an international hit, peaking at number #26 in Australia. Vidal toured around the world promoting it. She appeared in the 1985 horror comedy film Once Bitten as a member of a high school band, and contributed two songs to the Once Bitten soundtrack. Jimmy Iovine then signed Vidal as a solo artist to A&M; Records after hearing her demo of \\"Do Me Right\\", which had been written and produced for her by Desmond. It became the first single off her 1987 eponymous debut solo album and was very popular internationally, especially in South America. The music video was directed by David Fincher. In 1991, she sang a duet with Desmond Child on the Burt Bacharach/Desmond Child penned power ballad, \\"Obsession.\\" At the time, Vidal was making her third solo album with British-owned Charisma Records, but the album was never released. As a singer, songwriter and producer, Vidal has contributed to many other artists' music. Vidal contributed backup vocals to Kiss' Paul Stanley's solo album, Stevie Nicks' single \\"I Can't Wait\\" as well as a few other tracks from Nicks' solo album \\"Rock A Little\\", and was a featured vocalist for The Smithereens' single \\"A Girl Like You\\". She appears on many of Belinda Carlisle's solo albums, including the 1989 album \\"Runaway Horses\\". Other highlights include vocals for artists such as: Ellen Foley, Aerosmith, Seal, Alice Cooper, Celine Dion, Toto, Bette Midler, Real McCoy and Cher. Maria also appears on albums from Cat Stevens, and, most recently, Lana Del Rey. As a songwriter, Vidal wrote the hit single ‚ÄúSummer Rain‚Äù for Belinda Carlisle, which was covered in 2004 by Slinkee Minx, as well as the title song to Carlisle's album ‚ÄúA Woman and a Man‚Äù. The song \\"Angel\\"; in which she co-wrote (from her 1987 solo album) was also recorded by Expose on their 1992 self titled album. Vidal has written songs with Desmond Child, Billy Steinberg, and Rick Nowels, including Ace of Base single \\"Every Time it Rains\\" and Belinda Carlisle's \\"California.\\" As a studio vocal arranger and producer, Vidal has worked with a myriad of artists. Vidal's credits include Carrie Underwood and the other finalists on American Idol season 4. In May 2009, Vidal announced the release of her album Living in Radical Radiance.

He contributed to the conversion of John Henry Newman. In 1963, he was beatified by Pope Paul VI. Birth and early life Barberi was born Domenico Giovanni Barberi near Viterbo to a poor family of Italian farmers in 1792. His parents died in his early childhood and he was raised by his maternal uncle, Bartolomeo Pacelli. As a boy he was employed to take care of sheep. An elderly Capuchin priest taught him to read. Although he read all the books he could obtain, he had no regular education.Carey, C.P., Kenan. The Apostle of the Second Spring, Paulist Press. New York. 1945 When Napoleon suppressed the religious communities in the Papal States, Barberi became acquainted with several Passionists living in exile near his town. Barberi befriended these Passionists and served daily Mass with them. When Barberi was one of the few men in his locality not chosen for military conscription, he felt it was a sign from God that he should enter a religious community. Barberi believed that he was called to preach the Gospel in far-off lands. He would later affirm that he had received a specific call to preach to the people of England. Paul of the Cross, founder of the Passionist Congregation, also had great enthusiasm for converting England.Wilson, C. P., Alfred (1967); Blessed Dominic Barberi, Supernaturalised Briton, p. 36. Passionists Barberi was received into the Congregation of the Passion in 1814 after the re-establishment of the religious orders in the Papal States. Initially Barberi served as a lay brother, but once his extraordinary gifts were revealed his status was changed to that of a clerical novice, in an extraordinary break with custom. During his studies Barberi's brilliance was an example to his fellow students, although he would often take steps to play down his intelligence. He was ordained a priest on 1 March 1818. After completing the regular course of studies, Barberi taught philosophy and theology to the students of the congregation as lector for a period of ten years, first in Sant'Angelo and then in Rome. He now lived at the monastery of Saints John and Paul on the Celian Hill. During this period he produced many theological and philosophical works. In the summer of 1830 he was asked to aid an English convert to Catholicism, Sir Henry Trelawney, with regard to the rubrics of the Mass. Through this meeting Barberi made the acquaintance of Ignatius Spencer and influential English Catholics such as Ambrose Phillips. This was to be the first step in a journey which would eventually bring Barberi to England. Through his continued correspondence with these persons, Barberi's hopes for England's conversion were kept alive. Barberi at that time held in Italy the offices of rector, provincial consultor, and provincial, and fulfilled the duties of these positions with ability. At the same time he constantly gave missions and retreats, always mindful of his hopes to travel and preach in England. In 1830, when he was thirty-eight, Barberi was chosen to establish a new monastery at Lucca. In 1839 the Passionist General Chapter met and discussed the possibility of making a foundation in England. Finally in January 1840, negotiations were completed with regard to a Passionist foundation at Ere, near Tournai, in Belgium, the superiors, mindful of Barberi's singular vocation to England, in spite of his age and ill health, sent Barberi to be superior of the Belgian mission. Foundations in Belgium and England The first Passionist Retreat in Belgium was founded at Ere in June 1840. On arrival in Belgium the local bishop was so unimpressed with Barberi's plebeian appearance that he was subjected to intense examination in moral theology before being allowed to hear confessions. Life in Belgium posed plenty of problems for the Passionists; one of the Brothers had fallen ill, the community was in abject poverty, and Barberi had few words of French. Barberi's spirit rose to the occasion and soon the community was flourishing and even Barberi enjoyed good health. In September Barberi received a letter from Bishop Wiseman, the head of the English mission, inviting Barberi to start a Passionist foundation in England at Aston Hall. Barberi, with the permission of the Passionist General, visited the site in November 1840, though Ignatius Spencer warned Barberi that the situation in England would mean this would not be a favourable time to make such a foundation. Barberi set out for England once more in October 1841, where he was greeted with stares and suspicion, not only as a Catholic priest, but for the strange garb of the Passionist habit. J. Brodrick SJ, in his work on the \\"Second Spring\\" of Catholicism in England, says of FBarberi's arrival, \\"The second spring did not begin when Newman was converted nor when the hierarchy was restored. It began on a bleak October day of 1841, when a little Italian priest in comical attire shuffled down a ship's gangway at Folkestone.\\" After many months of waiting at Oscott College, Barberi finally secured possession of Aston Hall in Staffordshire in February 1842, after 28 years of effort, thereby establishing the Passionists in England. The initial reception of Barberi and his fellow Passionists was less than welcoming. Local Catholics feared the arrival of these newcomers would cause renewed persecutions. Barberi was also met with ridicule: his attempts to read prayers in English were met with the laughter of his congregation. However, the community increased in numbers. As the people of Aston grew to know Barberi, they became enamoured of him and Barberi soon began to receive a steady stream of converts. A centre was also set up in neighbouring Stone, where Barberi would also say Mass and preach to the local populace. Opposition to Barberi was also present in Stone, where on his journeys to the Mass centre, local youths would throw stones at him, though two youths took to the decision to become Catholics when they were greatly edified to see Barberi kiss each stone that hit him and place it in his pocket. During many of these frequent attacks, Barberi barely escaped death. Local Protestant ministers often held anti-Catholic lectures and sermons to ward the people away from Barberi and the Catholics. Wilson records how one of these ministers followed Barberi along a street shouting out various arguments against transubstantiation, Barberi was silent, but as the man was about to turn off, Barberi retorted: \\"Jesus Christ said over the consecrated elements, \\"This is my body.\\" You say, \\"No. It is not his body!\\" Who then am I to believe? I prefer to believe Jesus Christ.\\" Converts increased at Stone, so much so that a new church had to be built. It was at Aston, however, that on 10 June 1844 the first Corpus Christi procession was held in the British Isles, an event which attracted thousands of Catholics and Protestants alike. Barberi then began to visit other parishes and religious communities in order to preach, such \\"missions\\", as they were called, causing Barberi's reputation to become widely known. They frequently took place in the industrial cities of northern England, such as Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham. Newman's conversion The College, Littlemore where Barberi received Newman into the Church While in Italy and later in Belgium, Barberi had always kept up a keen interest in the Oxford Movement. In 1841 a letter by John Dobree Dalgairns appeared in L'Univers explaining the position of the Anglican High Church party. Barberi decided to respond to this letter in the mistaken belief that it represented the views of the entire faculty of Oxford University. (Dalgairns was an undergraduate when he wrote the letter.) Barberi's \\"Letter to University Professors at Oxford\\"\\"Letter to University Professors at Oxford\\", 5 May 1841. describes his long hopes for the conversion of England and his belief that the men of Oxford would be instrumental in such a conversion. The letter, through the help of Ignatius Spencer, eventually ended up in the hands of Dalgairns, who was residing with John Henry Newman at Littlemore. Barberi repudiated the Anglican claim that the 39 Articles could be interpreted in a Catholic light. In their continued correspondence Dalgairns and Barberi debated the Catholic position and Dalgairns requested copies of the Passionist Rule and Dominic's 'The Lament of England'. Eventually Dalgairns was received into the Catholic Church by Barberi at Aston in September 1845. In October of that same year Barberi visited Littlemore, where Newman made his confession to him. Newman relates in his \\"Apologia\\" how Barberi arrived soaked from the rain and as was drying himself by the fire when Newman knelt and asked to be received into the Catholic Church.Newman, J. H. (1864). Apologia Pro Vita Sua. p. 325. This event is marked by a sculpture in the Catholic Church of Blessed Dominic Barberi at Littlemore. Two of Newman's companions at Littlemore were also received, and Barberi celebrated Mass for them the following morning. Subsequently, Newman and Barberi always took note of each other's careers. Further work and death Window from Blessed Dominic's Shrine The community at Aston had gained 15 religious members. In 1846 a new foundation was made at Woodchester in Gloucestershire and in 1848 the Passionists arrived in London. In the last years of his life, Barberi engaged in negotiations for the foundation of St Anne's Retreat, Sutton, where today he lies buried. In 1847 George Spencer, Barberi's longstanding friend, was received into the Congregation of the Passion. Throughout this time, Barberi fulfilled his duties in preaching missions and heading the English and Belgian foundations. One story told of Barberi during this time exemplifies a sense of humour. While he was visiting a convent of nuns who were instructing many converts, some of them male, Barberi was informed that some of the sisters were worried about teaching men. Barberi retorted, \\"Have no fear, Sisters. You are all too old and too ugly.\\" The Sisters appreciated Barberi's humour so much that they recorded the incident in their archives. Such work inevitably took its toll upon Barberi's health and from 1847 he insisted that his life had nearly run its course. He had preached numerous retreats, both alone and with Spencer, both in England and Ireland. On 27 August 1849, Barberi was travelling from Paddington, London to Woodchester, when at Pangbourne he suffered a heart attack. Because in London \\"the cholera was then prevalent\\", there were no hotels that would take him in, and so it was decided to bring him back at Reading (in the Railway Tavern, later the Duke of Edinburgh Hotel, now demolished). The up-train arrived more than hour later, while \\"he remained in great agony but in peace and with 'Thy will be done' ever on his lips\\". Alt URLCompare with the following details: Barberi was buried in St Anne's Church, St Helens, Merseyside, which is also the shrine of Elizabeth Prout and Ignatius Spencer. During the Mass celebrated at the \\"Blessed Dominic shrine Church of St Anne and Blessed Dominic\\" two months before the 50th anniversary of the beatification, Archbishop Bernard Longley explained why he believed \\"Blessed Dominic\\" was an ideal patron for the Year of Faith, which ran until 24 November. Barberi was also been claimed patron of the Year of Faith for the Archdiocese of Birmingham. Beatification and legacy Barberi was beatified by Pope Paul VI in 1963, during the Second Vatican Council. Barberi is best remembered for his part in Newman's conversion, but is also commemorated for his work in the efforts to return England to the Catholic faith in the 19th century. In his years in England Barberi established three churches and several chapels, preached innumerable missions and received hundreds of converts, not only Newman, but others such as Spencer and Dalgairns. A relic of Barberi was given to Monsignor Keith Newton, Ordinary of the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham, for the ordinariate to be kept at Our Lady of the Assumption Church, Warwick Street. Literary works The shrine of Blessed Dominic Barberi Among Barberi's works are courses of philosophy and moral theology; a volume on the Passion of Our Lord; a work for nuns on the Sorrows of the Blessed Virgin, \\"Divina Paraninfa\\"; a refutation of de Lamennais; three series of sermons; and various controversial and ascetic works. One of Barberi's most famed works was his 'Lamentation of England',The Lamentation of England. Published in England in 1831. in which he used the words of the Prophet Jeremiah to express the lamentations of English Catholics.

The accord officially divided the Sultanate of Mataram between Mangkubumi and Pakubuwono.. The name Giyanti was taken from the location of the signing of the agreement, namely in Giyanti Village (Dutch spelling) which is now located in Hamlet Kerten, Jantiharjo Village, southeast of Karanganyar, Central Java.  Background  The treaty was a result of a succession war in 1749‚Äì57. Pakubuwono II, king of Mataram, had backed a Chinese rebellion against the Dutch. In 1743, in payment for his restoration to power, the King ceded the north coast of Java and Madura to the Dutch East India Company. Later, before his death in 1749, he ceded the remainder of the kingdom. Mataram then became a vassal state of the company. Pakubuwono III, who was supported by the company, became the new king, but he had to face a rival of his father, Raden Mas Said, who had occupied a region called Sukowati. In 1749 Mangkubumi, the brother of the late Pakubuwono II, dissatisfied with his inferior position, joined Raden Mas Said in the struggle against Pakubuwono III. The company sent troops to assist its vassal king, but the rebellion continued. Not until 1755 did Mangkubumi break away from Raden Mas Said and accept a peace offer at Gianti, by which Mataram was divided into two parts. Raden Mas Said signed a treaty with the company in 1757, which entitled him to have a part of eastern Mataram. He was thenceforth known as Mangkunegara I.Map of former sultanate Mataram, 1757.  Negotiations  Location of the signing of the Giyanti Agreement in Karanganyar, Central Java. According to the daily register documents of Nicolaas Hartingh, the then-Dutch East India Company Governor for North Java, he left Semarang to meet with Prince Mangkubumi on 10 September 1754. The actual meeting with Prince Mangkubumi was only held on September 22, 1754. The following day, closed-door negotiations were held which only a few people attended. Prince Mangkubumi was accompanied by Prince Natakusuma and Tumenggung Ronggo. Hartingh himself was accompanied by Hendrik Breton, Captain C. Donkel, and his secretary, Willem Fockens. The interpreter was Bastani. In the first talks about the division of Mataram, Hartingh expressed reservations because he did not think there could not be two leaders in one empire. Mangkubumi responded by saying that there was more than one sultan in Cirebon. The negotiations did not go smoothly due to the suspicion between the parties. Finally, after vowing not to break each other's promises, the negotiations picked up. Hartingh again suggested that Mangkubumi not use the sunan title and determined which areas would be controlled by him. Mangkubumi objected to giving up the title of sunan because the people had recognized him as sunan five years earlier. Prince Mangkubumi was appointed as Sunan who was in charge of the Sultanate of Mataram when Pakubuwana II died in Kabanaran, at the same time the Dutch East India Company installed Duke Anom as Pakubuwana III. The negotiations had to be stopped but continued the next day. On September 23, 1754 a memorandum of understanding was finally reached, which concluded that Prince Mangkubumi would use the title of sultan and obtain half of the empire. The north coast of Javam or the coastal areas which had been surrendered to the Dutch East India Company remained in the hands of the Dutch East India Company and half of the compensation for the control would be given to Mangkubumi. In addition, Mangkubumi would also get half of the palace heirlooms. The memorandum of understanding was then submitted to Pakubuwana III. On 4 November 1754, Pakubuwana III delivered a letter to the Governor- General of the Dutch East India Company, Jacob Mossel, regarding his agreement on the outcome of negotiations between the Governor of North Java, Hartingh, and Prince Mangkubumi. Based on the negotiations carried out on September 22-23, 1754 and the approval letter of Pakubuwana III, the Agreement on February 13, 1755 was signed in Giyanti. After the signing of the treaty, Mangkubumi took the title of Sultan Hamengkubuwono and set up his court in Yogyakarta, not far from Kotagede, now a suburb of the city, where the tomb of Senopati, the founder of Mataram, is located. Terms Based on the terms of the agreement, the eastern half of the Sultanate of Mataram in central Java was given to Pakubuwono III with Surakarta as its capital, while the western half was given to Prince Mangkubumi with its capital in Yogyakarta. This treaty marked the division of the former territory of Mataram Sultanate between Surakarta Sunanate and Yogyakarta Sultanate. After the signing of the treaty, Prince Mangkubumi changed his title as prince and became known as Sultan Hamengkubuwono I. The accord, however, did not end hostilities in the area since Prince Sambernyawa (or Raden Mas Said) continued to fight against Pakubuwono III. The division of Java was recorded in a series of Javanese texts altogether known as the Babad Giyanti or Babad Mankubuni√®n with the best known Babad Giyanti possibly having been composed by Yasadipura the Elder in the early 19th century.  Articles of the Agreement  Soedarisman Poerwokoesoemo in his book, the Duchy of Pakualaman, writes the following: # Article 1 - The Prince of Mangkubumi was appointed Sultan Hamengkubuwana Senapati in Alaga Abdurrahman Sayyidin Panatagama Khalifatullah over half of the Mataram Sultanate conferred on him by inheritance to his heirs, in this case the Duke of Anom Bendoro Raden Mas Sundoro. # Article 2 - There will always be cooperation between the people under the Dutch East India Company and the people of the sultanate. # Article 3 - Before Dalem (Rijks-Bestuurder) and the regents begin their duties, they must take the oath of allegiance to the Dutch East India Company. Dalem is a day-to-day executive power executive with the approval of a resident or governor. # Article 4 - The Sultan shall not lift or dismiss the Dalem and Regent before obtaining approval from the Dutch East India Company. # Article 5 - Sri Sultan will pardon the Regent in favor of the Dutch East India Company in war. # Article 6 - The Sultan will not claim his rights over Madura Island and the coastal areas which have been handed over by Sri Sunan Pakubuwana II to the Dutch East India Company in his contract dated May 18, 1746. Instead, the Dutch East India Companywill compensate the Sultan with 10,000 royalties annually. # Article 7 - The Sultan will provide assistance to Sri Sunan Pakubuwana III whenever necessary. # Article 8 - Sri Sultan promises to sell the Dutch East India Company ingredients at certain prices. # Article 9 - The Sultan promises to abide by all the agreements entered into between the previous Mataram rulers and the Dutch East India Company, in particular the treaties made in 1705, 1733, 1743, 1746, and 1749. # Article 10 - Termination of this Agreement from signed by N. Hartingh, W. van Ossenberch, J.J. Steenmulder, C. Donkel, and W. Fockens of the Dutch East India Company.

Biography Jesper Rasmussen Brochmand was born in K√∏ge, Zealand. He attended Herlufsholm Academy in Copenhagen, followed by training as a theological student in the Netherlands at Leiden University and the University of Franeker. He returned to Copenhagen in 1608 to serve as Rector of Herlufsholm Academy. In 1610, he became a Professor P√¶dagogicus at University of Copenhagen, professor of Greek in 1613 and a member of the theological faculty in 1615. In 1617 he was appointed tutor to Crown Prince Christian, eldest son of King Christian IV, returning to the university three years later. He was ordained Bishop of Zealand (Bisper√¶kke for Sj√¶llands stift) in 1639. During his long and fruitful activity in this office, he reorganized the worship service of the Church of Denmark, especially by abolishing the Latin choir and by introducing Wednesday services during Lent.Jesper Brochmand (Dansk Biografisk Leksikon) At this same time, Denmark was impacted by the Counter-Reformation efforts of the Roman Catholic Church through propaganda generated by the scholastic revival. Brochmand made the controversy with Rome a subject of his public lectures. In 1626‚Äì28, he published his Controversi√¶ sacr√¶ (3 parts), a reply in the style of Lutheran scholasticism to Cardinal Bellarmine's attacks on the Lutheran Church. In 1634, at the king's order, he engaged in a polemic with the Jesuits, who endeavored to defend the conversion of Christian William, Margrave of Brandenburg to Roman Catholicism.Carl Frederik Bricka: Brochmand, Jesper Rasmussen, 1585-1652, Biskop (Dansk biografisk Lexikon / III)Bishop Brochmand featured on Postverk F√∏roya stamp, 2003Against this pamphlet Brochmand delivered a series of lectures which, after his death, were collected and published under the title Apologi√¶, speculi veritatis confutatio (1653). His reputation as a dogmatist was established by his Systema universae theologiae (2 vols., 1633) in which he proved himself a firm opponent, not only of the Roman Catholics, but also of Calvinism. He wrote several devotional works, of which his Sabbati sanctificatio was for more than two centuries a favorite collection of sermons with the Danish people.

The energy has free-electron-like momentum dependence, p2/2m, where m=0.46me. Color scale represents electron counts per kinetic energy and emission angle channel. When 21.22 eV photons are used, the Fermi level is imaged at 16.64 eV. T=300K. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is a powerful technique used in condensed matter physics to probe the structure of the electrons in a material, usually a crystalline solid. The technique is best suited for use in one- or two-dimensional materials. It is based on the photoelectric effect, in which an incoming photon of sufficient frequency dislodges an electron from the surface of a material. By directly measuring the kinetic energy and momentum distributions of the emitted photoelectrons, the technique can be used to map the electronic band structure, provide elemental information, and map Fermi surfaces. ARPES has been used by physicists to investigate high-temperature superconductors and materials exhibiting charge density waves. The main components of an ARPES system are a source to deliver a high-frequency monochromatic beam of photons, a sample holder connected to a manipulator used to position and manipulate the material, and an electron spectrometer. The equipment is contained within an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environment, which protects the sample and prevents the emitted electrons from being scattered. After being dispersed, the electrons are directed to a microchannel plate detector, which is linked to a camera. Energy dispersion is carried out for a narrow range of energies around the pass energy, which enables the electrons to reach the detector. Some ARPES systems have an electron extraction tube alongside the detector, which measures the electrons‚Äô spin polarization. Systems that use a slit can only make angular maps in one direction. For two-dimensional maps, the sample is rotated, or the electrons are manipulated.  Instrumentation  Typical 350x350px frameless A typical instrument for angle-resolved photoemission consists of a light source, a sample holder attached to a manipulator, and an electron spectrometer. These are all part of an ultra-high vacuum system that provides the necessary protection from adsorbates for the sample surface and eliminates scattering of the electrons on their way to the analyzer. The light source delivers a monochromatic, usually polarized, focused, high-intensity photon beam to the sample (~1012 photons/s with a few meV energy spread). Light sources range from compact noble-gas discharge UV lamps and radio- frequency plasma sources (10‚Äì‚Å†40 eV), ultraviolet lasers (5‚Äì‚Å†11 eV) to synchrotron insertion devices that are optimized for different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum (from 10 eV in the ultraviolet to 1000 eV X-rays). The sample holder accommodates samples of crystalline materials, the electronic properties of which are to be investigated, and facilitates their insertion into the vacuum, cleavage to expose clean surfaces, precise manipulation as the extension of a manipulator (for translations along three axes, and rotations to adjust the sample's polar, azimuth and tilt angles), precise temperature measurement and control, cooling to temperatures as low as 1 kelvin with the help of cryogenic liquefied gases, cryocoolers, and dilution refrigerators, heating by resistive heaters to a few hundred ¬∞C or by backside electron-beam bombardment for temperatures up to 2000 ¬∞C, and light beam focusing and calibration. Electron trajectories in an ARPES spectrometer shown in the plane of angular dispersion. The instrument shows a certain degree of focusing on the same detection channel of the electrons leaving the crystal at the same angle but originating from two separate spots on the sample. Here, the simulated separation is 0.5 mm. |alt=|350x350px The electron spectrometer disperses along with two spatial directions the electrons reaching its entrance concerning their kinetic energy and their emission angle when exiting the sample. In the type most commonly used, the hemispherical electron energy analyzer, the electrons first pass through an electrostatic lens that picks electrons emitted from its own small focal spot on the sample (conveniently located some 40 mm from the entrance to the lens), enhances the angular spread of the electron plume, and serves it to the narrow entrance slit of the energy dispersing element with adjusted energy. Angle- and energy- resolving electron spectrometer for ARPES The energy dispersion is carried out for a narrow range of energies around the so-called pass energy in the direction perpendicular to the slit, typically 25 mm long and >0.1 mm wide. The angular dispersion of the cylindrical lens is only preserved along the slit, and depending on the lens model and the desired angular resolution can amount to ¬±3¬∞, ¬±7¬∞ or ¬±15¬∞. The hemispheres of the energy analyzer are kept at constant voltages so that the central trajectory is followed by electrons that have the kinetic energy equal to the set pass energy; those with higher or lower energies end up closer to the outer or the inner hemisphere at the other end of the analyzer. This is where an electron detector is mounted, usually in the form of a 40 mm microchannel plate paired with a fluorescent screen. Electron detection events are recorded using an outside camera and are counted in hundreds of thousands of separate angle vs. kinetic energy channels. Some instruments are additionally equipped with an electron extraction tube at one side of the detector to enable the measurement of electrons spin polarization. Modern analyzers are capable of resolving the electron emission angles as low as nearly 0.1¬∞. Energy resolution is pass-energy and slit-width dependent so the operator chooses between measurements with ultrahigh resolution and low intensity (<1 meV at 1 eV pass energy) or poorer energy resolutions of 10 or more meV at higher pass energies and with wider slits resulting in higher signal intensity. The instrument's resolution shows up as artificial broadening of the spectral features: a Fermi energy cutoff wider than expected from the sample's temperature, and the theoretical electron's spectral function convolved with the instrument's resolution function in both energy and momentum/angle. Sometimes, instead of hemispherical analyzers, time-of- flight analyzers are used. These, however, require pulsed photon sources and are most common in laser-based ARPES labs. Theory Principle Angle- resolved photoemission spectroscopy is a potent refinement of ordinary photoemission spectroscopy. Photons with a frequency u have an energy E, defined by the equation: :E=h u where h is Planck's constant. A photon is used to stimulate the transition of an electron from an occupied to unoccupied electronic state of the solid. If the photon's energy is greater than the electron's binding energy E_B, the electron will eventually be emitted with a characteristic kinetic energy E_k and angle \\\\vartheta relative to the surface normal. The kinetic energy is given by: :E_k=h u-E_B. Electron emission intensity maps can be produced from these results. The maps represent the intrinsic distribution of electrons in the solid. and are expressed in terms of E_B and the Bloch wave is described by the wave vector \\\\mathbf{k}, which is related to the electrons' crystal momentum and group velocity. In the process, the Bloch wave vector is linked to the measured electron's momentum \\\\mathbf{p}, where the magnitude of the momentum, |\\\\mathbf{p}|, is given by the equation: : |\\\\mathbf{p}|=\\\\sqrt{2 m_e E_k}. Only the component that is parallel to the surface is preserved. The component of the wave vector parallel to the direction of the crystal lattice \\\\mathbf{k}_{||} is related to the parallel component of the momentum and \\\\hbar, the reduced Planck constant, by the expression: :\\\\mathbf{k}_{||}= \\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\hbar}\\\\mathbf{p}_{||} This component is known, and its magnitude is given by: :|\\\\mathbf{ k}_{||}= \\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\hbar}\\\\sqrt{2 m_e E_k} \\\\sin\\\\vartheta. Because of this, and its pronounced surface sensitivity, ARPES is best suited to the complete characterization of the band structure in ordered low-dimensional systems such as two-dimensional materials, ultrathin films, and nanowires. When it is used for three-dimensional materials, the perpendicular component of the wave vector k_{\\\\perp} is usually approximated, with the assumption of a parabolic, free-electron-like final state with the bottom at energy -V_0. This gives: :k_{\\\\perp}=\\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\hbar}\\\\sqrt{2m_e(E_k \\\\cos^2\\\\\\\\!\\\\vartheta+V_0)}.  Fermi surface mapping  Electron analyzers that need a slit to prevent the mixing of momentum and energy channels are only capable of taking angular maps along one direction. To take maps over energy and two-dimensional momentum space, either the sample is rotated in the proper direction so that the slit receives electrons from adjacent emission angles, or the electron plume is steered inside the electrostatic lens with the sample fixed. The slit width will determine the step size of the angular scans: if a 30 mm long slit is served with a 30¬∞ plume, this will, in the narrower (say 0.5 mm) direction of the slit average signal over a 0.5mm by 30¬∞/30mm, that is, 0.5¬∞ span, which will be the maximal resolution of the scan in that other direction. Coarser steps will lead to missing data, and a finer step to overlaps. The energy-angle- angle maps can be further processed to give energy-kx-ky maps, and sliced in such a way to display constant energy surfaces in the band structure and most importantly the Fermi surface map when cutting near the Fermi level.  Emission angle to momentum conversion  350x350px ARPES spectrometer measures angular dispersion in a slice Œ± along its slit. Modern analyzers record these angles simultaneously, in their reference frame, typically in the range of ¬±15¬∞. To map the band structure over a two-dimensional momentum space, the sample is rotated while keeping the light spot on the surface fixed. The most common choice is to change the polar angle œë around the axis that is parallel to the slit and adjust the tilt œÑ or azimuth œÜ so emission from a particular region of the Brillouin zone can be reached. The measured electrons have these momentum components in the reference frame of the analyzer \\\\mathbf{P}=[0,P\\\\sin\\\\alpha,P\\\\cos\\\\alpha], where P=\\\\sqrt{2 m_e E_k}. The reference frame of the sample is rotated around the y axis by œë (\\\\mathbf{P} there has components R_y(\\\\vartheta)\\\\,\\\\mathbf{P}), then tilted around x by œÑ, resulting in \\\\mathbf{p}=R_x(\\\\tau)R_y(\\\\vartheta)\\\\,\\\\mathbf{P}.

Theoretical derivation of intensity relationship  The theory of photoemission is that of direct optical transitions between the states |i\\\\rangle and |f\\\\rangle of an N-electron system. Light excitation is introduced as the magnetic vector potential \\\\mathbf{A} through the minimal substitution \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\mapsto \\\\mathbf{p}+e\\\\mathbf{A} in the kinetic part of the quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian for the electrons in the crystal. The perturbation part of the Hamiltonian comes out to be: :H' = \\\\frac{e}{2m} (\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{p} + \\\\mathbf{p}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{A}) + \\\\frac{e^2}{2m} |\\\\mathbf{A}|^2. In this treatment, the electron's spin coupling to the electromagnetic field is neglected. The scalar potential \\\\phi set to zero either by imposing the Weyl gauge \\\\phi=0 or by working in the Coulomb gauge abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{A}=0 in which \\\\phi becomes negligibly small far from the sources. Either way, the commutator \\\\left[\\\\mathbf{A},\\\\mathbf{p}\\\\right]=i\\\\hbar\\\\, abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{A} is taken to be zero. Specifically, in Weyl gauge abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\approx0 because the period of \\\\mathbf{A} for ultraviolet light is about two orders of magnitude larger than the period of the electron's wave function. In both gauges it is assumed the electrons at the surface had little time to respond to the incoming perturbation and add nothing to either of the two potentials. It is for most practical uses safe to neglect the quadratic |A|^2 term. Hence, H' = \\\\frac{e}{m} \\\\mathbf{A}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{p}. The transition probability is calculated in time-dependent perturbation theory and is given by the Fermi's golden rule: :\\\\Gamma_{i \\\\to f} = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\hbar} |\\\\langle f|H'|i \\\\rangle|^2 \\\\delta(E_f-E_i-h u)\\\\propto |\\\\langle f|\\\\mathbf{A} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{p}|i\\\\rangle|^2 \\\\, \\\\delta(E_f-E_i-h u), The delta distribution above says that energy is conserved when a photon of energy h u is absorbed E_f=E_i+h u. If the electric field of an electromagnetic wave is written as \\\\mathbf{E}(\\\\mathbf{r},t)=\\\\mathbf{E_0}\\\\sin(\\\\mathbf{k}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\omega t), where \\\\omega=2\\\\pi u, the vector potential holds its polarization and equals to \\\\mathbf{A}(\\\\mathbf{r},t)=\\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\omega}\\\\mathbf{E_0}\\\\cos(\\\\mathbf{k}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\omega t). The transition probability is then given in terms of the electric field as :\\\\Gamma_{i \\\\to f} \\\\propto |\\\\langle f|\\\\tfrac{1}{ u}\\\\mathbf{E_0} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{p}|i\\\\rangle|^2 \\\\, \\\\delta(E_f-E_i-h u). In the sudden approximation, which assumes an electron is instantaneously removed from the system of N electrons, the final and initial states of the system are taken as properly antisymmetrized products of the single particle states of the photoelectron |k_i\\\\rangle, |k_f\\\\rangle and the states representing the remaining N-1 electron systems. The photoemission current of electrons of energy E_f=E_{k} and momentum \\\\mathbf{p}=\\\\hbar \\\\mathbf{k} is then expressed as the products of *|\\\\langle k_f|\\\\mathbf{E_0} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{p}|k_i\\\\rangle|^2 = M_{fi}, known as the dipole selection rules for optical transitions, and *A(\\\\mathbf{k},E), the one-electron removal spectral function known from the many-body theory of condensed matter physics summed over all allowed initial and final states leading to the energy and momentum being observed. Here, E is measured with respect to the Fermi level EF and Ek with respect to vacuum so E_k = E+h u-W where W , the work function, is the energy difference between the two referent levels that is material, surface orientation, and surface condition dependent. Because the allowed initial states are only those that are occupied, the photoemission signal will reflect the Fermi-Dirac distribution function f(E)=\\\\frac{1}{1+e^{(E-E_F)/k_BT}} in the form of a temperature-dependent sigmoid-shaped drop of intensity in the vicinity of EF. In the case of a two- dimensional, one-band electronic system the intensity relation further reduces to I(E_k,\\\\mathbf{k_{||}})=I_M(\\\\mathbf{k_{||}},\\\\mathbf{E_0}, u)\\\\, f(E)\\\\, A(\\\\mathbf{k_{||}},E) .  Selection rules  The electronic states in crystals are organized in energy bands, which have associated energy-band dispersions E(k) that are energy eigenvalues for delocalized electrons according to Bloch's theorem. From the plane-wave factor \\\\exp(i\\\\mathbf{k}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{r}) in Bloch's decomposition of the wave functions, it follows the only allowed transitions when no other particles are involved are between the states whose crystal momenta differ by the reciprocal lattice vectors \\\\mathbf{G}, i.e. those states that are in the reduced zone scheme one above another (thus the name direct optical transitions). Another set of selection rules comes from M_{fi} (or I_M) when the photon polarization contained in \\\\mathbf{A} (or \\\\mathbf{E_0}) and symmetries of the initial and final one-electron Bloch states |k_i\\\\rangle and |k_f\\\\rangle are taken into account. Those can lead to the suppression of the photoemission signal in certain parts of the reciprocal space or can tell about the specific atomic- orbital origin of the initial and final states.  Many-body effects  ARPES 361x361px The one-electron spectral function that is directly measured in ARPES maps the probability the state of the system of N electrons from which one electron has been instantly removed is any of the ground states of the N‚àí1 particle system: :A(\\\\mathbf{k},E) = \\\\sum_{m} \\\\left |\\\\, \\\\left \\\\langle \\\\begin{matrix} (N-1)\\\\mathrm{\\\\mbox{-}eigenstate} \\\\\\\\\\\\ m \\\\end{matrix} \\\\,\\\\,|\\\\,\\\\, \\\\begin{matrix} (N)\\\\mathrm{\\\\mbox{-}eigenstate} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathrm{with\\\\,} \\\\mathbf{k} \\\\mathrm{\\\\,removed} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\, \\\\right |^2 \\\\, \\\\delta(E-E^{N-1}_m+E^{N}) . If the electrons were independent of one another, the N electron state with the state |k_i\\\\rangle removed would be exactly an eigenstate of the N‚àí1 particle system and the spectral function would become an infinitely sharp delta function at the energy and momentum of the removed particle; it would trace the E_o(\\\\mathbf{k}) dispersion of the independent particles in energy-momentum space. In the case of increased electron correlations, the spectral function broadens and starts developing richer features that reflect the interactions in the underlying many-body system. These are customarily described by the complex correction to the single particle energy dispersion that is called the quasiparticle self energy, \\\\Sigma(\\\\mathbf{k}, E) = \\\\Sigma'(\\\\mathbf{k}, E) + i \\\\Sigma(\\\\mathbf{k}, E). It contains the full information about the renormalization of the electronic dispersion due to interactions and the lifetime of the hole created by the excitation. Both can be determined experimentally from the analysis of high- resolution ARPES spectra under a few reasonable assumptions. Namely, one can assume that the M_{fi} part of the spectrum is nearly constant along high- symmetry directions in momentum space and that the only variable part comes from the spectral function, which in terms of \\\\Sigma, where the two components of \\\\Sigma are usually taken to be only dependent on E, reads : A(\\\\mathbf{k}, E) = -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi} \\\\frac{\\\\Sigma(E)}{\\\\left[E-E_{o}(\\\\mathbf{k})-\\\\Sigma'(E)\\\\right]^2+\\\\left[\\\\Sigma(E)\\\\right]^2} Lorentzians whose width at half maximum is determined by the imaginary part of the self energy, while their deviation from the bare band is given by its real part.|alt=|350x350px This function is known from ARPES as a scan along a chosen direction in momentum space and is a two-dimensional map of the form A(k,E). When cut at a constant energy E_m, a Lorentzian-like curve in k is obtained whose renormalized peak position k_m is given by \\\\Sigma'(E_m) and whose width at half maximum w is determined by \\\\Sigma(E_m), as follows: #\\\\Sigma'(E_m) = E_m-E_{o}(k_m) #\\\\Sigma(E_m) = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left[E_{o}(k_m+{\\\\textstyle \\\\frac{1}{2}}w) - E_{o}(k_m-{\\\\textstyle \\\\frac{1}{2}}w) \\\\right] The only remaining unknown in the analysis is the bare band E_{o}(k). The bare band can be found in a self-consistent way by enforcing the Kramers-Kronig relation between the two components of the complex function \\\\Sigma(E) that is obtained from the previous two equations. The algorithm is as follows: start with an ansatz bare band, calculate \\\\Sigma(E) by eq. (2), transform it into \\\\Sigma'(E) using the Kramers-Kronig relation, then use this function to calculate the bare band dispersion on a discrete set of points k_m by eq. (1), and feed to the algorithm its fit to a suitable curve as a new ansatz bare band; convergence is usually achieved in a few quick iterations. From this obtained self-energy, one can judge on the strength and shape of electron-electron correlations, electron-phonon (more generally, electron-boson) interaction, active phonon energies, and quasiparticle lifetimes. In simple cases of band flattening near the Fermi level because of the interaction with Debye phonons, the band mass is enhanced by (1+Œª) and the electron-phonon coupling factor Œª can be determined from the linear dependence of the peak widths on temperature.  Uses  ARPES has been used to map the occupied band structure of many metals and semiconductors, states appearing in the projected band gaps at their surfaces, quantum well states that arise in systems with reduced dimensionality, one- atom-thin materials like graphene transition metal dichalcogenides, and many flavors of topological materials. It has also been used to map the underlying band structure, gaps, and quasiparticle dynamics in highly correlated materials like high-temperature superconductors and materials exhibiting charge density waves. When the electron dynamics in the bound states just above the Fermi level need to be studied, two-photon excitation in pump-probe setups (2PPE) is used. There, the first photon of low-enough energy is used to excite electrons into unoccupied bands that are still below the energy necessary for photoemission (i.e. between the Fermi and vacuum levels). The second photon is used to kick these electrons out of the solid so they can be measured with ARPES. By precisely timing the second photon, usually by using frequency multiplication of the low-energy pulsed laser and delay between the pulses by changing their optical paths, the electron lifetime can be determined on the scale below picoseconds.

Helfand is a U.S. astronomer who served as president of Quest University Canada from 2008-2015. Prior to his presidency at Quest, he was a Visiting Tutor at Quest. He has also served as chair of the Department of Astronomy at Columbia University and co-director of the Columbia Astrophysics Laboratory. He was also part of the university's Physics Department. His stated research interests include radio surveys, the origin and evolution of neutron stars and supernova remnants, and active galactic nuclei. Helfand has been instrumental in the creation of general education classes oriented around the sciences, developing a course, Frontiers of Science, that has subsequently become part of the Core Curriculum of Columbia College, the university's undergraduate liberal arts and sciences division. He holds a Bachelor of Arts from Amherst College and a Ph.D. from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. At Columbia University David Helfand has been affiliated with Columbia University since 1977. Immediately after obtaining his PhD from the University of Massachusetts, he joined Columbia as a research associate for two years before obtaining a tenure track position. He has, at times, been part of both the department of Astronomy and the Department of Physics. As part of the department of Astronomy he served as chair from 1986 until 1992, and again from 2002 until the present. During his time at Columbia he has mentored 22 PhD students, although he tends to focus more on undergraduate education. As part of Columbia University, he along with Darcy Kelley, a professor of biological sciences, pushed for and succeeded in creating a new science core curriculum class called Frontiers of Science, which is claimed to \\"make (students) aware that they can think about problems the way scientists think about problems\\". Rather than being taught by a single professor on a single topic, \\"four scientists in different disciplines deliver a series of three lectures each describing the background, context, and current state of an area of research\\". He was elected a Legacy Fellow of the American Astronomical Society in 2020. Quest University Canada Helfand joined Quest University Canada in British Columbia, Canada, as a Visiting Tutor in 2007. In July 2011, Helfand took a long-term leave of absence from Columbia and assumed the presidency of Quest University. This private university embodies many of his views, by having \\"no faculty ranks, no tenure and no departments\\", and he claims that this approach by Quest University \\"fosters academic freedom, minimizes bureaucracy, and places the university's focus on teaching and scholarship.\\" This unusual educational approach at Quest University has attracted media attention. Additionally, as part of Quest, he started a course called \\"Global Warming: What We Know and What We Don't Know\\" focusing on a \\"dispassionate\\" approach to the subject. Helfand was motivated to develop the course because of what he believed to be \\"a large amount of misinformation\\" in the climate change debate. Viewpoints on tenure Helfand notably declined an offer of tenure from Columbia in the early 1980s due to his belief that the tenure system does more to deny academic freedom to those who do not have tenure than it does to protect the freedom of those who do have tenure. He believes that it also selects the wrong fraction of smart people in society to play the important role of advancing knowledge and passing it on to the next generation. He advocates a system in which each senior professor's job performance is reviewed every six years by a five-member ad hoc faculty committee, which would then recommend whether the professor should be retained or dismissed. In such a system, each professor would serve on one such ad hoc committee per year, except for the year in which he or she is being reviewed. Although his proposed system is unorthodox, Columbia agreed to implement it in Helfand's case. Skepticism \\"Surviving the Misinformation Age\\" at CSICon 2016 David Helfand is a fellow for the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and, in addition to starting the course on global warming at Quest University, he has often expressed views in line with the skeptical movement. In 2006, he signed a document written by the Washington DC office of the Center for Inquiry called the \\"Declaration in Defense of Science and Secularism\\". This document expressed worry about the \\"disdain for science\\" expressed by many Americans, and \\"the persistence of paranormal and occult beliefs\\". Furthermore, in 2011 he wrote an opinion piece in The New York Times criticizing ESP research by Daryl Bem, stating that \\"I have little doubt that Professor Bem's experiments will fail (to be replicated)\\".

Golden handcuffs come in different forms, such as employee stock options, which endow only when the employee has been with the company or organization for a certain number of years, and contractual agreements, consisting of bonuses or other forms of benefits which must be repaid to the company if the employee leaves before the date agreed on. Golden handcuffs are frequently used for jobs that require rare and specialised skills or in a \\"tight labor market\\", where jobs are more common than workers. In any case, although they are very expensive, they are usually less expensive than the cost to replace a particular employee. Golden handcuffs often receive scrutiny from shareholders and directors. Impacts When offered, golden handcuffs are extremely tempting as they usually are of great value compared to the employee's annual salary. The experience that follows an agreement of this sort may be draining and abhorrent, which is why the contract must be thoroughly analysed and thought about until an intelligent conclusion or compensation, that benefits both the company and the employee, is agreed upon. Often employees feel the urge to remain within the company they've been working with, even though it may not seem like the smartest choice, objectively, because of tradition, relationships or a simple feeling of belonging. When different opportunities are offered to an employee, generally the choice is made by a mix of objective and subjective views, where he or she must prioritise every aspect of their opportunities in order to result with a beneficial solution. These sort of agreements might potentially impose penalties if the employee decides to leave the company before the contracted date, such as the repayment of bonuses. Often included in these contracts are non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), where the employee is prohibited to communicate sensitive corporate information, and non-compete clauses, where working for competitors is forbidden for the leaving employee. Structure Top talent is usually quite rare, so companies often negotiate deals in order to hold on to key employees. Golden handcuffs constitute one of several ways to stop companies' key employees leaving, making it essentially financially unprofitable for them to walk away from their employers. Such deals are usually done with stock options, phantom stock or deferred payments. Phantom stock usually gives the best results, as it gives an employee of a company using the technique a motive for staying with the company and making it grow, since the stock increases in value alongside the company. To create a contract that benefits both the employee and the company, a legal team should be contacted in order to discuss available options, and key employees should be distinguished from others. A funding mechanism should be put in place by the company (if privately held), where obligations are present. Tax repercussions should be minimised for the money set aside, usually using insurance as main funding mechanism. If designed perfectly, the corporation can manage to receive all its money back after paying the employee. Typical arrangements Salary reduction and bonus deferral These two types of arrangements follow the 401k style where an executive can defer salaries and bonuses annually. Retirement money withdrawal At retirement, or in the general future, money can be withdrawn and the executive can support his or her savings using pre-tax capital. SERP (Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan) Also known as a \\"Top Hat\\" program, a SERP is funded entirely by the employer and consists of a retirement plan that implements benefits apart from those covered in other retirement plans such as IRA (Individual Retirement Account), 401(k) or NQDC plans. This is usually done through Permanent (Whole Life) Insurance. Excess Benefit Plans Excess Benefit Plans are NQDC plans that grant benefits only to employees whose benefits are limited by section 415 of the IRS. These limitations diminish the volume of benefit that some highly paid employees profit from amounts they might differently be able to gain without these constraints.

Haarsma created a free, online role-playing game, also called the Rings of Orbis, set in the same universe. Both the book-series and the game target young, often reluctant readers in an attempt to encourage them by rewarding them for reading. Haarsma developed a school presentation program in which he discusses The Softwire books, astronomy, and other science fiction and science fact topics. He is also one of the co-founders of Kids Need to Read, a United States Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(3) tax exempt public charity that purchases books to donate to underfunded schools and libraries. Personal life Philip-Jon Haarsma was born on June 5, 1964, in Georgetown, Ontario. Though he was named after his grandfathers, Philip and Jon, he went simply by \\"Jon\\" while growing up. Later, while attending McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, where he received a Bachelor of Science degree, he began to use his initials, \\"PJ\\", and his books are published under the name \\"PJ Haarsma\\". After he moved to the United States in 1989, Haarsma worked as a fashion and commercial photographer in New York City and Miami. He received many photography awards, including an honorable mention at the Cannes Lion Awards in 1996. Haarsma owns a production company called Redbear Films, Inc. The company produced one movie (Devious Beings, 2002), and a digital series called Con Man starring Alan Tudyk and Nathan Fillion and several corporate ads for clients such as Hewlett Packard and Nokia. For 15 years, Redbear Films focused on the production of advertisements. Haarsma lives in Los Angeles with his wife, sci-fi fantasy artist and host of Your Mystical Guide, Marisa Grieco, and their daughters Skylar and Zoe. Con Man (digital series) Haarsma at the 2017 Phoenix Comicon, promoting Con Man PJ Haarsma is the producer and show-runner of the SyFy series, Con Man created by Alan Tudyk and co-produced by Nathan Fillion. The series is currently in its second season and available on the SyFy channel. PJ Haarsma set up the Con Man series at Lionsgate with executive, Seth Laderman. PJ Haarsma crowdfunded the first series of Con Man, setting records through Indiegogo. Haarsma produced the first season with a 23-day shooting schedule. As a 30-year production veteran, Haarsma sees little difference producing a web series over films, TV, or advertising. This series operated under SAG New Media and IATSE contracts, and crew members came from projects like Interstellar, Lord of the Rings, and TV's Agents of SHIELD. From the Fast Company Article: ‚ÄúThe deliverables are the only thing that‚Äôs different. Every other aspect is the same‚Äîgetting the story, keeping the budget in line, creating a fun set, and keeping people from getting crazy,‚Äù says Haarsma. ‚ÄúFor a producer, the biggest thing is knowing everyone else‚Äôs job to make sure everything‚Äôs moving properly, anticipate what could go wrong, and having a tool chest to be able to solve it. ‚Äù Rings of Orbis At the age of 38, Haarsma was not satisfied with his professional life. He began to keep a daily journal, writing about anything (and everything) that came to his mind‚Äîuntil eventually \\"Johnny T came onto [his] page.\\" Johnny T is the main character, Johnny Turnbull, of Haarsma's The Softwire series. Haarsma chose to give The Softwire a sci-fi setting due to a love of science fiction, and to target a young adult audience with his novels so that children could discover and learn to enjoy the genre. The Softwire is actually a story that Haarsma began imagining in his childhood. As a teenager, he worked at his parents' ceramic factory during the summers, hauling fifty pound molds around in the extreme heat of a kiln room. To Haarsma, it felt similar to what the children of his books might feel as slaves. In addition to these experiences, there is a more prominent influence on the premise of The Softwire‚Äîthat is, there is a mystery of a journey to a new, unknown place to start a new life. Growing up, Haarsma dreamed of moving to the United States; and in his twenties, he actually did. While there, living in New York, Miami, San Francisco and Los Angeles, Haarsma witnessed immigrants struggling to get by. He tried to imagine what caused them to risk everything, and to move to another country, and to have a chance at something better. It is this journey (and struggle) that is prevalent in The Softwire. In The Softwire, a group of human children are orphaned in outer space. They are forced into indentured servitude on the Rings of Orbis, four planet-like rings around a wormhole. They must spend four years as slaves or knudniks before they are eligible to become Citizens. Each year they are the property of a new owner on a separate ring: Orbis 1, Orbis 2, Orbis 3, and Orbis 4. They are forced into labor to do whatever task their new owner requires. When the children arrive, they soon discover that thirteen-year-old Johnny Turnbull (JT), is the first human softwire, a boy who has the ability to enter any computer with just his mind. To the older Citizens, a slave who can enter at will the massive computer which controls the Rings of Orbis makes JT very valuable and drives the Rings to the brink of war. As the central computer begins to malfunction, the Citizens connive, conspire, and even kill to own JT and his sister. While there are other humans besides the children on the Rings, the majority of the inhabitants are of alien species. The Keepers are an intelligent species of two-headed beings who act as the overseers. Other species encountered include Belarans, Choi, Solinns, and Trefaldoors, all of which become interesting roles for young players to choose from in the game, Rings of Orbis. Rings of Orbis game Haarsma's novels are accompanied by a free, online, role- playing game called Rings of Orbis which acts as a visual companion to the books and is set in the same universe. Players are sometimes required to use information from the books in order to solve puzzles and to unlock areas within the game. Pairing a video game with a novel for young readers, Haarsma says, ‚Äúbrings the book into their world, as opposed to going the other way around.‚Äù Haarsma and a team of artists also created many different alien races specifically for the game. The team includes Haarsma's wife Marisa Grieco, Igor Knezevic, Stephan Martini√®re, Dwayne Harris, and Neil Blevins. The game works to encourage reluctant readers, especially boys, by giving them an interactive game through which to relate to the mysteries found within the books themselves. Players complete quests and earn in-game currency which they can then spend on in-game items designed by Haarsma, all the while they compete to become the best Citizen of the Rings of Orbis. In 2008, the game was featured in a front page New York Times article about encouraging reluctant readers with video games. Promotion of literacy Kids Need to Read While speaking at schools across the United States, Haarsma noticed how some school librarians were having trouble finding funds to purchase The Softwire books after a demand had been created by Haarsma's visit. Many of the librarians were struggling to fill their shelves with books. In June 2007, Haarsma and a friend, actor Nathan Fillion, approached a group of Fillion's fans with the idea for a project that would work to purchase books for underfunded schools, as well as nonprofit institutions which gave books directly to children. The group took to the idea and focused their energies into getting the project off the ground. The Kids Need to Read project went public in August 2007. In January 2008, the process to transform the project into a legal foundation began, and the fan group was separated from the developing organization. On May 22, 2008, The Kids Need to Read Foundation (KNTR) was incorporated in the state of California. KNTR became an Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(3) tax exempt public charity on September 18, 2008, with a retroactive exemption date of May 22, 2008. The organization is supported by a global volunteer base. Funds were initially raised through eBay auctions of Firefly and Serenity autographed memorabilia, and The Softwire books and items, and other science fiction and literary themed items. Fundraising efforts have since expanded and all funds are used to purchase books from the foundation's official book list, a list which is continually updated by a professional children's book buyer. The titles chosen are well-reviewed and many are recommended for children who are reluctant readers. KNTR has made book donations to forty-one schools and libraries in addition to three multiple library systems. KNTR facilitated a substantial donation of three thousand books by the Phoenix Book Company to the Friends of the New Orleans Public Library, to help with recuperation after Hurricane Katrina. The Odessa Brown Children's Clinic in Seattle was the recipient of a donation amounting to four hundred forty books in February 2008. This clinic, as well as the North Public Health Clinic in Seattle, have received recurring donations from KNTR. Haarsma remains on the KNTR Advisory Board as founder and consultant for literacy-based activities. By using his position as a young-adult fiction author, Haarsma helps bring attention, support, and funds to the organization. School visits Haarsma takes part in school visits to promote his book and encourage imagination and reading in the school children. His presentation lasts fifty minutes, and discussions center around space travel, exploration, The Rings of Orbis universe, and other interactive topics, thus allowing for questions from the students at the conclusion. To help illustrate the scientific topics, NASA supplied Haarsma with space related information to present. \\"PJ Haarsma was inspirational. He visited my school and made my imagination soar. I've already filled up a couple notebooks of stories thanks to him!\\" Says one child whose school Haarsma visited. During his presentation, Haarsma involves the children in various interactive activities. These include a Hollywood-style acting audition, an alien ghost story, and a demonstration of the vast distances in space. The activities are designed to engage the children's imaginations and to make them feel a part of the presentation. The responses to his visits from both students and teachers are positive. The majority of the feedback involves praise and thanks. Haarsma has received many stories of previously reluctant readers being observed reading The Softwire books during school recess.

It represented an important transition in Indian art from use of wood to stone. It was a royal art patronized by Mauryan kings especially Ashoka. Pillars, Stupas, caves are the most prominent survivals. The most significant remains of monumental Mauryan art include the remains of the royal palace and the city of Pataliputra, a monolithic rail at Sarnath, the Bodhimandala or the altar resting on four pilars at Bodhgaya, the rock-cut chaitya-halls in the Barabar Caves near Gaya including the Sudama cave bearing the inscription dated the 12th regnal year of Ashoka, the non-edict bearing and edict bearing pillars, the animal sculptures crowning the pillars with animal and vegetal reliefs decorating the abaci of the capitals and the front half of the representation of an elephant carved out in the round from a live rock at Dhauli.Mahajan V.D. (1960, reprint 2007). Ancient India, New Delhi: S.Chand, New Delhi, , p.348 Ananda Coomaraswamy, writing in 1923, argued that the Mauryan art has three main phases. The first phase is found in some instances of the representation of the Vedic deities (the most significant examples are the reliefs of Surya and Indra at the Bhaja Caves). However the art of the Bhaja Caves is now generally dated later than the Mauryan period, to the 2nd-1st centuries BCE. The second phase was the court art of Ashoka, typically found in the monolithic columns on which his edicts are inscribed and the third phase was the beginning of brick and stone architecture, as in the case of the original stupa at Sanchi, the small monolithic rail at Sanchi and the Lomas Rishi Cave in the Barabar Caves, with its ornamented facade, reproducing the forms of wooden structure. Most scholars agree that Mauryan art was influenced by Greek and Persian art, especially in imperial sculpture and architecture. Political and cultural contacts between the Greek and Persian cultures and India were intensive and ran for a long period of time, encouraging the propagation of their advances in the area of sculpture. Sculpture Rampurva bull capital, detail of the abacus, with two \\"flame palmettes\\" framing a lotus surrounded by small rosette flowers. This period marked an imaginative and impressive step forward in Indian stone sculpture; much previous sculpture was probably in wood and has not survived. The elaborately carved animal capitals surviving on from some Pillars of Ashoka are the best known works, and among the finest, above all the Lion Capital of Ashoka from Sarnath that is now the National Emblem of India. Coomaraswamy distinguishes between court art and a more popular art during the Mauryan period. Court art is represented by the pillars and their capitals,Thapar, Romila (2001). and the Decline of the Mauryas, New Delhi: Oxford University Press, , pp.267-70 and surviving popular art by some stone pieces, and many smaller works in terracotta. The highly polished surface of court sculpture is often called Mauryan polish. However this seems not to be entirely reliable as a diagnostic tool for a Mauryan date, as some works from considerably later periods also have it. The Didarganj Yakshi, now most often thought to be from the 2nd century CE, is an example. Pillars and their capitals The Pataliputra capital, showing both Achaemenid and Greek influence, with volute, bead and reel, meander and honeysuckle designs. Early Mauryan period, 4th-3rd century BC. The Pataliputra capital, dated to the 3rd century BCE, has been excavated at the Mauryan city of Pataliputra. It has been described as Perso-Iionic, with a strong Greek stylistic influence, including volute, bead and reel, meander or honeysuckle designs. This monumental piece of architecture tends to suggest the Achaemenid and Hellenistic artistic influence at the Mauryan court from early on.Report on the excavations at PƒÅtaliputra (Patna); the Palibothra of the Greeks by Waddell, L. A. (Laurence Austine)Hellenistic Elements in the Sculptural and Terracotta Art of Mauryan Period by Vinay Kumar Vaishali Emperor Ashoka also erected religious pillars throughout India. These pillars were carved in two types of stone. Some were of the spotted red and white sandstone from the region of Mathura, the others of buff-coloured fine grained hard sandstone usually with small black spots quarried in the Chunar near Varanasi. The uniformity of style in the pillar capitals suggests that they were all sculpted by craftsmen from the same region. It would therefore seem, that stone transported from Mathura and Chunar to the various sites where the pillars have been found and here the stone was cut and carved by craftsmen They were given a fine polish characteristic of Mauryan sculpture. These pillars were mainly erected in the Gangetic plains. They were inscribed with edicts of Ashoka on Dhamma or righteousness. The animal capital as a finely carved lifelike representation, noteworthy are the lion capital of Sarnath, the bull capital of Rampurva and the lion capital of Lauria Nandangarh. Much speculation has been made about the similarity between these capitals and Achaemenid works. \\"Popular\\" sculpture Statuettes of the Mauryan era The two monumental Yakshas discovered in Patna (size: 2 meters tall), and thought to be 3rd century BCE. The two Brahmi inscriptions starting with 14px12px... (Yakhe... for \\"Yaksha...\\") are paleographically of a later date, circa 2nd century CE Kushan. Left statue inscription: \\"Yakhe Achusatigika\\". Right statue inscription: \\"Yakhe Sanatananda\\".Report of a tour in Bihar and Bengal, p.3 Indian Museum, Kolkota. The work of local sculptors illustrates the popular art of the Mauryan period. This consisted of sculpture which probably was not commissioned by the emperor. The patrons of the popular art were the local governors and the more well-to-do subjects. It is represented by figures such as the female figure of Besnagar, the male figure of Parkham and the whisk- bearer from Didarganj (although its age is debated). Technically they are fashioned with less skill than the pillar capitals. They express a considerable earthiness and physical vitality. The stone elephant at Dhauli was also probably carved by local craftsmen and not by the court-based artists who were responsible for the animal capitals. The image of the elephant emerging from the rock is a most impressive one, and its purpose was probably to draw attention to the inscription nearby. Terracottas Popular terracotta objects of various sizes have been found at Mauryan sites, and elsewhere, and are probably the most numerous Mauryan works of art. Made by local people who may not have been specialists, but for example potters with a sideline, they are very difficult to date if not recorded as coming from an identifiable archaeological context. Many are regarded as pre-Mauryan, but a continuation of the tradition of making mother-goddesses in clay, which dates back to the prehistoric period is revealed by the discovery of these objects at Mauryan levels during the excavations at Ahicchatra. They are found more commonly from Pataliputra to Taxila. Many have stylized forms and technically they are more accomplished, in that they have a well-defined shape and clear ornamentation. Some appear to have been made from moulds, yet there is little duplication. Terracotas from Taxila consists of deity figures, votive reliefs with deities, toys, dice, ornaments and beads. Among the ornaments were round medallions, similar to the bullae worn by Roman boys. Terracotta images of folk gods and goddesses often have an earthy charm (some of them are perhaps dolls). Many animal figures are probably toys for children.

They may have a specific religious purpose, or a more general one promoting fertility, or been used to make jewellery by hammering metal foil over the designs.Lerner and Kossak, 48 (quoted); Bennett (2019), 99; V&A; About 70 have been found, many only as fragments, with a 2014 find in Thailand the first from outside the Indian subcontinent; it is assumed this was imported from India.Bennett (2019), 95  Painting  While we can be sure of Mauryan proficiency in this field based on the descriptions of Megasthenes, unfortunately no proper representative has been found to date. Many centuries later, the paintings of the Ajanta Caves, the oldest significant body of Indian painting, show there was a well-developed tradition, which may well stretch back to Mauryan times.  Architecture  Lomas Rishi Cave in the Barabar Caves, 3rd century BCE. While the period marked a second transition to use of brick and stone, wood was still the material of choice. Kautilya in the Arthashastra advises the use of brick and stone for their durability. Yet he devotes a large section to safeguards to be taken against conflagrations in wooden buildings indicating their popularity. Plan of the 80-columns pillared hall in Kumhrar. The Greek ambassador Megasthenes mentions that the capital city of Pataliputra was encircled by a massive timber-palisade, perforated by holes or slits through which archers could shoot. It had sixty-four gates and 570 towers.Mahajan V.D. (1960, reprint 2007). Ancient India, New Delhi: S.Chand, New Delhi, , p.281 According to Strabo, the gilded pillars of the palace were adorned with golden vines and silver birds. The palace stood in an extensive park studded with fish ponds. It was furnished with a great variety of ornamental trees and shrubs. Excavations carried out by Spooner and Waddell have brought to light remains of huge wooden palisades at Bulandi Bagh in Pataliputra. The remains of one of the buildings, an 80 pillared hall at Kumrahar are of particular significance. Out of 80 stone columns, that once stood on a wooden platform and supported a wooden roof, Spooner was able to discover the entire lower part of at least one in almost perfect conditions. It is more or less similar to an Ashokan pillar, smooth, polished and made of grey Chunar sandstone.Mahajan V.D. (1960, reprint 2007). Ancient India, New Delhi: S.Chand, New Delhi, , p.349 Many stupas like those at Sanchi, Sarnath and probably Amaravati were originally built as brick and masonry mounds during the reign of Ashoka. Unfortunately they were renovated many times, which leaves us with hardly a clue of the original structures.  Pottery  Use of the potters wheel became universal. The pottery associated with the Mauryan period consists of many types of ware. But the most highly developed technique is seen in a special type of pottery known as the Northern Black Polished Ware (NBP), which was the hallmark of the preceding and early Mauryan periods. The NBP ware is made of finely levigated alluvial clay, which when seen in section is usually of a grey and sometimes of a red hue. It has a brilliantly burnished dressing of the quality of a glaze which ranges from a jet black to a deep grey or a metallic steel blue. Occasionally small red-brown patches are apparent on the surface. It can be distinguished from other polished or graphite-coated red wares by its peculiar lustre and brilliance. This ware was used largely for dishes and small bowls. It is found in abundance in the Ganges valley. Although NBP was not very rare, it was obviously a more expensive ware than the other varieties, since potsherds of NBP were occasionally found riveted with copper pins indicating that even a cracked vessel in NBP ware had its value.Thapar, Romila (2001). and the Decline of the Mauryas, New Delhi: Oxford University Press, , pp.239-49 Coins punch marked coin of the Mauryan empire, with symbols of wheel and elephant (3rd century BCE) The coins issued by the Mauryans are mostly silver and a few copper pieces of metal in various shapes, sizes and weights and which have one or more symbols punched on them. The most common symbols are the elephant, the tree in railing symbol and the mountain. The technique of producing such coins was generally that the metal was cut first and then the device was punched. These symbols are said to have either represented the Royal insignia or the symbol of the local guild that struck the coin. Some coins had Shroff (money changer) marks on them indicating that older coins were often re-issued. The alloy content closely resembles that specified in the Arthashastra. Based on his identification of the symbols on the punch-marked coins with certain Mauryan rulers, Kosambi argued that the Mauryan punch-marked Karshapana after Chandragupta has the same weight as its predecessor, but much more copper, cruder fabric, and such a large variation in weight that the manufacture must have been hasty. This evidence of stress and unsatisfied currency demand is accompanied by debasement (inflation) plus vanishing of the reverse marks which denoted the ancient trade guilds.Kosambi, D.D. (1988). The Culture and Civilization of Ancient India in Historical Outline, New Delhi: Vikas Publishing House, , p.164 This in his opinion indicated that there was a fiscal crisis in the later Mauryan period. However his method of analysis and the chronological identification has been questioned.Thapar, Romila (2001). and the Decline of the Mauryas, New Delhi: Oxford University Press, , p.289 Gallery File:Lohanipur torso.jpg|The Lohanipur torso.

The volunteers contribute in a variety of ways, as artisans, musicians, anthropologists and teachers, both professional and amateurs. Activities The Associa√ß√£o is centred in Lisbon, and works to preserve the tradition of the Transmontan bagpipe, an instrument of the northern Portuguese region of Tr√°s-os-Montes, which was at serious risk of extinction by the end of the 1980s. To revive the tradition, the association crafts new instruments, offers classes, and researches its history. The research has yielded a rich collection of interviews, images, and music from the last generation of traditional players, some of whom have since died. This has become an invaluable resource. The courses at the Escola de Gaitas (Bagpipe School) are divided into three levels. The Transmontan bagpipe is generally reserved for the advanced levels. Beginners start with the Galician bagpipe. As a non-profit institution, the school lacks its own facilities, and the classes are offered in various spaces, including the Alentejan Center of Lisbon. Students may rent an instrument, or buy one from the group's workshop. The workshop crafts different types of bagpipes, as well as their accessories, such as reeds, and uses a variety of woods as raw material. The quality of the instruments is remarkably good, as the workshop is vital to the Associa√ß√£o in spreading bagpipe lore. Besides making the instrument available to a growing number of students, the workshop shares craft techniques with other artisans, guaranteeing the preservation of the Transmontan bagpipe. The Associa√ß√£o also supports the spread of important national events related to Portuguese traditions, participating directly or indirectly. Among them, there are:Andan√ßas, Festa Trad, Encontro Regional de Gaiteiros da Pena, Tocar de Ouvido, Por Tierras de L' Rei and the L' Burro i L' Gueiteiro. The most important of them, the Encontro Nacional de Gaiteiros (National Meeting of Bagpipers) gathered more than 8,000 people in its four years, and has been covered by the main Portuguese newspapers and TV channels, like RTP and SIC. Gaitafolia Gaitafolia is a musical group formed by members of the AGF, among teachers and students, playing bagpipes and other traditional instruments crafted exclusively at its workshop. Their premiere was during Expo98, along with the famous Gaiteiros de Lisboa, and since then they have performed presentations and concerts with other renowned bands, such as Galandum Galundaina, Mandr√°gora and Dazkarieh. The repertoire varies from traditional tunes to modern ones. The group has been covered by French and Spanish media, and may be the best advertisement for the AGF. Recognition Through its work, the Associa√ß√£o Gaita-de-fole has received support for its project to promote the Transmontan bagpipe from the Arts Institute, the Bagpipe Society, Lelia Doura Association, the P√©dexumbo and the At-Tambur. As recognition for the relevance of its projects, the Portuguese Ministry of Culture has provided financial support for many of the activities of the AGF since 2001. Many events, classes, workshops and other projects have been covered by the media, in newspapers such as Expresso, P√∫blico and Di√°rio de Not√≠cias. The Associa√ß√£o has around 200 subscribed members, and many other non-members as supporters.

In March 2016, the original YouTube video was restored and is once again publicly available. The video still holds the views before it was taken down in 2011. Lim's cover of \\"Canon Rock\\" has been mentioned on CNN, 20/20, The New York Times, and National Public Radio, in addition to MBC news, CBC Radio, KBS news, and other South Korean news stations. Many viewers have speculated and thought of the video as fake because the audio is not synchronized with the video. Lim later stated to The New York Times that this had to do with the fact that \\"he recorded the audio and video independently and then matched them inexactly.\\" The performance itself was recorded in two parts, and edited together. An image of a traffic light was used to make the transition. Other activities Lim has now started to arrange well-known music by himself. He composed a holiday card to his fans called \\"Carol Rock (funtwo Is Coming to Town)\\", a rock version of \\"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\\". He also played Dream Theater's \\"Overture 1928\\", and recently he posted a video of himself performing Antonio Vivaldi's \\"Summer\\" from the Four Seasons, one of Vivaldi's most famous works. Lim initially expressed no wish to carry on playing as a professional guitarist. However his online fame has allowed him to play to live audiences several times‚Äî once for the South Korean ambassador in Washington, DC, then again at the KORUS festival the same year. At the KORUS festival, Lim played improvised, altered versions of the Korean national anthem and the American national anthem. The third time he played was in 2008, the November 22, at the YouTube Live festival where he performed with Joe Satriani, he played first a mix of Canon Rock and Joe's \\"Surfing With the Alien\\" and then \\"Canon Rock\\". In October 2009, he was a featured performer at the fall ICANN meeting's welcoming ceremony and later joined in at their music night. In the same interview in which he stated his wish to carry on playing guitar simply as a hobby, he also rated his own playing a modest 50/60 out of 100. The beginning of the music video for Weezer's song \\"Pork and Beans\\" is set in Lim's iconic room, with the various members playing their various instruments. The video as a whole contains references to numerous other internet phenomena. Onesided In March, 2010, Lim formed a band One Sided with former Pyon member Han Lee, Hwiju Park and Chris Lee, in Auckland, New Zealand. The band features Han Lee on vocals and rhythm guitar, Lim on lead guitar, Chris Lee on keyboard.

The head and part of the pelvis were found in 1923 northeast of the museum site on the Acropolis of Athens. It belongs to the late archaic or early classical period (Severe style). The curly hair points more to the Archaic than the Classical period. It measures 25 cm in the vertical, in the horizontal under the ears 12.5 cm and in the depth 22.8 cm. (Schrader 1939:197). This sculpture could have been created by one of the teachers of Phidias, Hegias of Athens or Ageladas of Argos. The original blond painting of the curly hair is faded.

Thereafter, he attended the University of Chicago, where he earned an M.A. in history in 1974 and a Ph.D. in history and anthropology in 1981. At the University of Chicago, he came under the influence of historical anthropologist Bernard Cohn. During this period, he frequently returned to South India for research. Career After teaching at the California Institute of Technology and the University of Michigan, Dirks moved to Columbia in 1997, where he dramatically altered the direction of the anthropology department, championing postcolonial and multidisciplinary approaches, and making a variety of strategic appointments. He was named vice president in charge of Columbia's Faculty of Arts and Sciences as of September 2004. Dirks is the author of numerous books on South Asian history and culture, primarily concerned with the impact of British colonial rule. His most famous works include The Hollow Crown: Ethnohistory of an Indian Kingdom (1987), Castes of Mind (2001), and The Scandal of Empire (2006). In these works, Dirks advanced the research on how British rule shaped the culture of the Indian subcontinent, as well as how Britain became influenced by its colonies. In November 2012, Dirks was selected as the Chancellor-Designate of the University of California, Berkeley. On November 27, 2012, the Regents of the University of California confirmed Dirks as UC Berkeley's next Chancellor. He took office on June 1, 2013. Dirks announced his resignation from the position on August 16, 2016 following controversy related to a longstanding budget deficit, improper spending, and his handling of sexual harassment claims at the campus.

In June 2020, Dirks was named president and CEO of The New York Academy of Sciences.  Berkeley Chancellorship  During his tenure, Dirks aspired to enhance the undergraduate experience, including the formation of a new undergraduate residential college, the creation of an undergraduate program in data science, the formation of a task force examining student housing, and efforts to improve the experiences of intercollegiate athletes at Berkeley. Dirks spearheaded new interdisciplinary programs including the Berkeley Arts + Design Initiative, and regional multi-institution research efforts such as the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, and global research and exchange partnerships. Dirks was also a highly successful fundraiser, including overseeing the completion of the Campaign for Berkeley. Under Dirks's leadership, the UC Berkeley administration was severely criticized. The most vocal criticism focused on decisions regarding sexual harassment by faculty and administrators. In particular, he presided over decisions to punish astronomer Geoffrey Marcy and then-incumbent Boalt Hall dean Sujit Choudhry. Dirks was also the subject of intense criticism for his handling of UC Berkeley's budget. Other contentious matters were the size of the fence around the on- campus mansion provided for him by the university, an emergency door installed in California Hall at university expense, an investigation for use of public funds for a personal trainer, and a wrongful termination claim filed by the former manager of University House.http://www.dailycal.org/2017/06/20/chancellor-dirks-former-house- manager-allegedly-instructed-lie-tax-forms/ On August 16, 2016, he announced his intent to resign after less than four years as chancellor.

The application that he should withdraw from further participation in the matter arose because the judge had made a number of jokes about one of the parties in the case, Sheikh Khalid Ben Abdfullah Rashid Alfawaz. They included the observations ‚Äî That the sheikh could choose ‚Äúto depart on his flying carpet‚Äù to escape paying costs ‚Äî That the sheikh should be available to attend hearings ‚Äúat this relatively fast-free time of the year‚Äù ‚Äî That he should be in court so that ‚Äúevery grain of sand is sifted‚Äù ‚Äî And that the sheikh‚Äôs evidence was ‚Äúa bit gelatinous . . . like Turkish Delight‚Äù.

My comments were poorly chosen. They were not intended to be racist, nor have I ever intended any disrespect or disregard for the tenets of Islam, or for the sheikh‚Äôs Saudi nationality and Arab ethnicity. My judicial work and public speeches clearly demonstrate that I am in no sense racist. ... I did attempt to arrange for the final hearing to be conducted by one of my colleagues, but the workload on the Family Division of the High Court and the judicial resources available to us did not permit this if a long postponement of the final hearing was to be avoided.

It is part of Shackford Head State Park. Connected to the mainland portion of Washington County at Passamaquoddy Pleasant Point Reservation by a causeway, the city of Eastport occupies several islands, including its major land mass, Moose Island. Other islands comprising the city include Carlow Island, Spectacle Island, Goose Island, and Treat Island, along with other islets. Quoddy Village lies at the north-western end of Moose Island, while the city's downtown lies at the eastern end of the island. The Eastport Municipal Airport lies between Quoddy Village and downtown Eastport. History During the War of 1812, British naval forces seized Moose Island while taking control of the entire Maine coast from Penobscot Bay to the St. Croix River. Following the war, the United States relinquished its claim in 1817 on several larger islands in the Bay of Fundy that Britain also claimed: (Campobello Island, Deer Island, Grand Manan Island). In return, Britain relinquished its claim on islands in Cobscook Bay. During the 1930s, President Franklin D. Roosevelt promoted the ill-fated Quoddy Project as a tidal power project for the Cobscook Bay area as part of his New Deal through the Public Works Administration. Part of this project involved construction of a tidal barrage between Moose Island and Pleasant Point to contain the waters of Cobscook Bay, resulting in the present-day causeway carrying Maine State Route 190 and the abandoned Maine Central Railroad. Moose Island is the birthplace of Brigadier General James Henry Carleton (b. 1814), commander of New Mexico and architect of the infamous Long Walk of the Navajo. Author Hampton Sides states: \\"The time of Carleton's youth was a fragile period in the history of eastern Maine. During the War of 1812, British forces had occupied most of Maine east of the Penobscot River and annexed the territory to New Brunswick....Some have speculated that it was Carleton's memory of this unpleasant experience from his adolescence--of his family having to endure a bitter, protracted, worrisome dispute along what amounted to a wild frontier--that gave him later in life such an urgent impatience to solve the Navajo problem with clean, stark finality.\\"Sides, Hampton.

Wright played for seven professional clubs spanning 14 years. Wright is currently assistant manager at Bonnyton Thistle. Playing career Born in East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, Wright's professional career began with Aberdeen in 1983. He won the Scottish Youth Cup as a trainee, alongside David Robertson, Joe Miller and Stevie Gray. However the competition for a striking place at Pittodrie was tough and he was never able to hold down a regular spot in the team, moving on to England and Queens Park Rangers for one season and then returning to Scotland for an equally brief spell with Hibernian. It was in the mid-to-late 1990s, however, that Wright was at the peak of his career in the Scottish Premier Division, firstly with St Johnstone and then Kilmarnock. He was transferred from Hibs to St Johnstone for ¬£275,000, and from St Johnstone to Kilmarnock for ¬£340,000, becoming both clubs' record buys. Wright scored the winning goal for Kilmarnock in the 1997 Scottish Cup Final against Falkirk. He brought his professional playing career to a close in 2002 with Greenock Morton and moved into junior football with Larkhall Thistle. Coaching career Wright moved into coaching after retirement and worked as Under-20s manager at Scottish Lowland Football League club BSC Glasgow until June 2017, when he joined his former Kilmarnock coach Alan Robertson at new South of Scotland League side Bonnyton Thistle.http://www.bonnytonthistlefc.co.uk/newsevents.html References External links  *Kilmarnock stats at Fitbastats *Profile and stats at AFC Heritage Trust Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:People from East Kilbride Category:Scottish footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Aberdeen F.C. players Category:Queens Park Rangers F.C. players Category:Hibernian F.C. players Category:St Johnstone F.C. players Category:Kilmarnock F.C. players Category:Falkirk F.C. players Category:Greenock Morton F.C. players Category:Larkhall Thistle F.C. players Category:Scottish Football League players Category:Scottish Premier League players Category:English Football League players Category:Scotland B international footballers Category:Scottish Junior Football Association players Category:Sportspeople from South Lanarkshire Category:Scotland under-21 international footballers ","title":"Paul Wright (footballer)"},{"id":"7078698","text":"Herrs Island, also known as Washington's Landing, is an island in the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania.

The film was written and directed by Academy Award-nominated husband-and-wife team of Eleanor Perry (screenplay adaptation) and Frank Perry (director). The story is based on the 1964 short story \\"The Swimmer\\" by John Cheever, which appeared in the July 18, 1964, issue of The New Yorker.\\"Screenplay info\\" TCM.com The 95-minute movie adds new characters and scenes consistent with those in the original 12-page short story. Plot On a sunny day in an affluent suburb in Connecticut, a fit and tanned middle-aged man in a bathing suit, Ned Merrill, drops by a pool party being held by old friends. They offer him a cocktail while nursing hangovers from the night before. As they share stories, Ned realizes there is a series of backyard swimming pools that could form a \\"river\\" back to his house, making it possible for him to \\"swim his way home\\". Ned dives into the pool, emerging at the other end and beginning his journey. Ned's behavior perplexes his friends, who apparently know worrisome things about his recent past which he seems to have forgotten. As Ned travels, he encounters other neighbors. He meets 20-year-old Julie, who used to babysit his daughters (whom he repeatedly refers to as \\"at home playing tennis\\"), and reveals his plan to her; she joins him. They crash another pool party and sip champagne. While chatting in a grove of trees, Julie reveals that she had a schoolgirl crush on Ned. After she tells him about two incidents of sexual harassment in her workplace, Ned begins talking about how he will protect her, making plans for the two of them. Discomfited by his intimate approaches, Julie runs away. Ned meets a wealthy older couple, unbothered by his eccentric behavior but also unimpressed by his posturing. He then encounters Kevin, a lonely young boy, whom he tries to teach how to swim. They use an abandoned, empty pool, which Ned urges the boy to imagine is filled with water. The boy warms to this method, and soon is \\"swimming\\" the length of the empty pool. As Ned takes his leave, he glances back and sees the boy bouncing on the diving board over the deep end of the empty pool. He rushes back to remove him from the diving board, then departs. Ned fails to make more than a superficial connection with the people he meets, being obsessed with his journey, and becoming increasingly out of touch with reality. The neighborhood consists of judgmental, well-heeled people intent on one-upmanship, and Ned is confused by hints that his life might not be as untroubled as he believes. Ned walks into another party where the hostess calls him a \\"party crasher\\". He encounters a bubbly girl named Joan, who does not know him. Ned asks her to join him, and Joan is intrigued until his speech becomes more fantastical. A friend leads her away from him. Ned jumps into the pool, making a big splash which grabs the attention of the guests. When he emerges from the water, he notices a hot dog cart that used to be his. Ned gets into a spat with the homeowner, who claims to have bought it at a white elephant sale. Ned shows up at the backyard pool of Shirley Abbott, a stage actress with whom he had an affair several years earlier. His warm memories of their time together contrast with her own experience of being \\"the other woman\\". Unable to reconcile his feelings with the pain he caused, Ned wades into the deep end of the pool. Ned trudges barefoot alongside a busy highway, then reaches a crowded public swimming pool. After being treated demeaningly by the gatekeeper, he encounters a group of local shop owners who derisively ask him \\"How do you like our water?\\" They indicate surprise at his appearance at such a plebeian location and ask him when he will settle his unpaid bills. When some of them make vicious comments about his wife's snobbish tastes and his out-of-control daughters' recent troubles with the law, Ned flees. The skies darken and rain begins falling. Amid a downpour at sunset, a shivering, limping Ned staggers home; the tennis court where his daughters were supposedly playing is in disrepair, and his house is locked and deserted, with several windows broken. Anguished, Ned repeatedly tries to open the door, before slumping to the ground in the doorway. Cast Burt Lancaster filming with Barbara Loden, before she was replaced with Janice Rule in the role of Shirley Abbott Casting notes * After working on several television series, Janet Landgard's first featured cinematic role was in this film. * The Swimmer was comedian Joan Rivers' film debut as an actress. She had appeared as herself three years earlier in Hootenanny a Go Go, also released as Once Upon a Coffeehouse. In The Swimmer, her short scene took an unexpectedly long time to film, which she blamed on Lancaster. She later wrote in her autobiography; \\"he redirected every line...Frank (Perry) wanted a happy girl who then got hurt. Lancaster was going to be Mr. Wonderful who came up against a mean bitch, and was right not to go off with her. Trying to please both men, I was going back and forth between line readings, and nothing made sense.\\" * Janice Rule replaced Barbara Loden in the part of Shirley Abbott. * Cheever has a cameo appearance in the film in a brief scene greeting the characters played by Lancaster and Landgard. Production The Swimmer was produced by Sam Spiegel, a three-time Academy Award for Best Picture winner, who ultimately removed his name from the film (although the logo of his company, Horizon Pictures, remains). It was filmed largely on location in Westport, Connecticut, hometown of director Frank Perry.\\"Notes\\" on TCM.com Principal production took place during the summer of 1966, but the film was not released until 1968. Although he was a trained athlete, star Burt Lancaster had a fear of the water, and took swimming lessons from former Olympian and UCLA water polo coach Bob Horn to prepare for the film. According to Rivers, Lancaster and Frank Perry had several confrontations on the set. Perry was ultimately fired by Spiegel sometime after the first cut of the film was screened. The producers then brought in Lancaster's friend, the young director Sydney Pollack, to salvage the project. Pollack reportedly reshot several transitions and scenes, including redoing the Shirley Abbott scene, with Janice Rule now playing the part originally played by Barbara Loden. According to Lancaster, when the film still needed an additional day of shooting, he paid $10,000 for it out of his own pocket.Stafford, Jeff \\"The Swimmer\\" on TCM.com Soundtrack The score was composed by a first-time film composer, 24-year- old Marvin Hamlisch, and was orchestrated by Leo Shuken and Jack Hayes. The music has dramatic passages for a small orchestra along with a mid-1960s pop sound.\\"Music\\" on TCM.com Hamlisch got the job after Spiegel hired him to play the piano at one of his legendary parties. The soundtrack album was originally released as an LP by CBS Records in 1968, while the complete score was released in 2006 by Film Score Monthly.\\"The Swimmer (1968)\\" Film Score Monthly Response The initial box office response to the film was \\"lackluster\\"Hastings, Michael \\"Review\\" at Allmovie.com but the critical response has improved in recent years, with the movie gaining cult film status. Film critic Roger Ebert called The Swimmer \\"a strange, stylized work, a brilliant and disturbing one.\\" Vincent Canby in The New York Times wrote: \\"although literal in style, the film has the shape of an open-ended hallucination. It is a grim, disturbing and sometimes funny view of a very small, very special segment of upper-middle-class American life.\\" Variety said: \\"a lot of people are not going to understand this film; many will loathe it; others will be moved deeply. Its detractors will be most vocal; its supporters will not have high-powered counter-arguments.\\" After the film's restoration and re-release by Grindhouse Releasing in 2014, Brian Orndorf of Blu-ray.com gave the Blu-ray release five stars, commenting; \\"it's a strange picture, but engrossingly so, taking the viewer on a journey of self-delusion and nostalgia that gradually exposes a richly tortured main character as he attempts to immerse himself in a life that's no longer available to him\\", commenting that Lancaster gives a \\"deeply felt, gut-rot performance...and communicates every emotional beat with perfection\\".Orndorf, Brian (March 24, 2014) \\"The Swimmer Blu-ray & DVD Combo Pack\\" review.

(with) a number of imperfections (including grain and dirt aplenty)\\", the image suffering from \\"a true lack of detail and bleeding colors\\" and was criticized for having few special features. In March 2014, Grindhouse Releasing/Box Office released The Swimmer on Blu-ray in high definition. The release received positive reviews, with Blu-ray.com giving it a rare five stars. Eccentric Cinema praised the company, saying \\"Grindhouse have been establishing themselves as the Criterion of offbeat cinema...

The king had to acknowledge Dutch imperial possessions in Colombo, Matara, Kalpitiya, Galle, Trincomalee, Mannar, and Batticaloa. The Dutch imposed their imperial authority on the coastlines of Sri Lanka whereby their influence would be recognized by the king four miles from the coast into the countryside. The Kingdom of Kandy was forbidden to engage in relations with foreign traders, as well as establish agreements with foreign nations against the Dutch Empire. The Dutch would govern the kingdom's cinnamon peeling industry. King Rajasinghe attempted to convince the Dutch imperial government to make alterations to the treaty. No amendments or changes to the treaty were made.

Chatino communities are located in the southeastern region of the state of Oaxaca in southern central Mexico. Their native Chatino language are spoken by about 23,000 people (Ethnologue surveys), but ethnic Chatinos may number many more. The Chatinos of San Juan Quiahije call themselves neq-a tnya-j and their language Chaq-f tnya-b. Chatino populations are found in the following Oaxacan municipalities, mostly in the area around Juquila: Santos Reyes Nopala, San Juan Quiahije or KichinA kiqyaC, San Miguel Panixtlahuaca, Santiago Yaitepec, Santa Cruz Zenzontepec, San Juan Lachao, Santa Mar√≠a Temaxcaltepec, Santa Catarina Juquila and Tataltepec de Vald√©s. The region that the Chatinos inhabit is rich in natural resources. Traditionally many Chatino people have been involved in agriculture, which depends very much on the climate, so some Chatinos have had to emigrate to the corners of the district of Juquila to work on coffee plantations. Most Chatino communities have public services, and there are runways for airports in many municipalities. Federal bilingual schools, high schools, and telesecundarias (distance education programs for secondary and high school students) have been established. The traditional authorities of this people are organized in a system based on civil and religious roles, in which advice from elders is treated as the greatest authority. They believe in the Holy Grandmother, the Holy Father Sun, the Holy Mother Earth, and the Holy Mother Moon. In addition, they worship the deities of water, wind, rain, the mountain, and fire. Chatino languages Chatino is a family of indigenous Mesoamerican languages, which is classified under the Zapotecan branch of the Oto-Manguean language family. The Chatino people have close cultural and linguistic ties with the Zapotec peoples, whose Zapotec language form the rest of the Zapotecan branch of the Otomanguean language family. According to Campbell,Campbell, Eric. 2013. \\"The Internal Diversification and Subgrouping of Chatino,\\" International Journal of American Linguistics 79:395-420. there are three main Chatino languages, which exhibit varying degrees of mutual intelligibility: Zenzontepec Chatino, Tataltepec Chatino, and Eastern or Highland Chatino. Varieties of Eastern or Highland Chatino are the most widely spoken. The Zenzontepec language is also spoken in Tlapanalquiahuitl and Tlacotepec; the Tataltepec language is used only in that municipio.Greenberg, James B. \\"Chatino.\\" In Dav√≠d Carrasco (ed).

Bruno Apitz (28 April 1900 ‚Äì 7 April 1979) was a German writer and a survivor of the Buchenwald concentration camp. Life and career Apitz was born in Leipzig, as the twelfth child of a washer woman. He attended school until he was fourteen, then started training as a printer. During World War I he was a passionate supporter of German Communist Party leader Karl Liebknecht. At 17, he made a speech in front of striking factory workers that resulted in his being sentenced to twenty-nine months in prison. In 1919 he joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and in 1927, the more radical Communist Party of Germany (KPD). He took active part in the German November Revolution of 1918 and in opposition to the Kapp Putsch of 1920. During the latter he published his first poems and short stories in Communist newspapers. He wrote his first play in 1924 and was later repeatedly imprisoned under Nazi rule in various concentration camps for spreading socialistic anti-war propaganda and being an active member of the Communist Party. From 1937 to 1945 he was an inmate of the Buchenwald concentration camp near Weimar. It was this stay that became the basis for his most famous novel, Nackt unter W√∂lfen (Naked among Wolves). After 1945 he worked for the East German state film company DEFA and as a radio play author. He was one of the founding members of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), which became the dominant party in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). In the early 1950s, Apitz worked as a guide to the former camp, Buchenwald, and was \\"actively involved in the plan for the earliest expedition to be shown there in 1952.\\"Nevin, Bill. The Genesis and Impact of Naked among Wolves. 2007. Note 30, p. 117. He was a member of the Academy of Arts and the PEN-Clubs of the GDR. Apitz's best selling novel Nackt unter W√∂lfen was first published in 1958 and then translated into over thirty languages, winning him worldwide recognition. The English translation, the only Apitz novel to have been translated into English, was by Edith Anderson and published by Seven Seas Books in 1967. The logline for this edition reads as follows: \\"Armies drive before them the rags of Hitler's might and news trickles through to the concentration camp inmates and a child is saved.\\" Bruno Apitz's home town, Leipzig, named him a Citizen of Honour in 1976.

Guitarist Anne McCue 2015  Early life and education  McCue grew up in Campbelltown, an area southwest of Sydney and graduated from Saint Patrick's college and the University of Technology, Sydney with a degree in Film Production and Film Studies. In 1988, McCue moved to Melbourne and took guitar lessons from Bruce Clarke.  Music career  McCue is a singer, songwriter, guitarist, multi-Instrumentalist, music- recording producer, engineer, and video director.  Early bands  McCue's first band was based in Sydney and was called Vertigo after the Alfred Hitchcock film. In 1998 in Melbourne, answering an ad in the local press, she joined all-female rock band Girl Monstar as lead guitarist (1988‚Äì1993). The band had two Number One hits on the Australian Independent Charts and eventually received an ARIA nomination for best independent act. Following her stint with Girl Monstar, she played acoustically around Melbourne, later performing in Vietnam for a year before returning to Melbourne to record her Laughing EP (1996). She then joined Australian female trio Eden A.K.A., who signed to Columbia Records in the USA. Eden A.K.A. released the album Eden in 1998, and performed in Canada and the USA at the Lilith Fair in 1998 and 1999.  Solo and band-leader success  Anne McCue plays lapsteel After signing with L.A. based manager, Mike Gormley, McCue's first solo album, Amazing Ordinary Things, was released in 1999 in Canada and Japan, and she toured with a number of well-known musicians, including a US tour with Lucinda Williams, who would often introduce McCue as \\"my new favorite artist... and an amazing guitarist\\". Williams later included McCue on her Starbucks' 'Artist's Choice' compilation alongside Paul Westerberg, John Coltrane, Ryan Adams, Patti Griffin and Leonard Cohen. McCue's success on the Lucinda Williams tour prompted the release of a live album, Live: Ballad of an Outlaw Woman, recorded at The Fillmore in San Francisco, California, and her first Messenger Records release, Roll. Roll also received numerous critical accolades, with Los Angeles Weekly stating that the Australian performer had more \\"all- American authenticity than a dozen Martina McBrides\\" and Entertainment Weekly drawing comparisons to Lucinda Williams and Canadian alt-country singer Kathleen Edwards. Bob Harris from the BBC went as far as to call it his album of the year, and she toured internationally to promote the album. McCue released her album Koala Motel on Messenger Records in 2006. She completed an international tour to promote the album. She relocated from Los Angeles to Nashville. In August 2007, McCue was invited by Deborah Conway to take part in the Broad Festival project, which toured major Australian cities including performing at the Sydney Opera House.

In 2013 McCue released her version of Bruce Springsteen's 'Born to Run' and began recording her new album Blue Sky Thinkin. In February 2015, McCue released Blue Sky Thinkin' a collection or original songs reminiscent of swing era jazz. The album is a return to her early days in music. In an interview, she noted, \\"In my earlier existence as a young guitar player in Melbourne, I wanted to be a jazz guitar player. I was studying jazz guitar. I was making my living playing jazz music, more like singing and playing guitar. ... So for me [Blue Sky Thinkin'] was more like going back to that. ... I love the guitar tone of that era. I love the sound of the recordings. To me it‚Äôs very warm sounding. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ever sounded better than that. So I was trying to get those sounds. I‚Äôve listened to Charlie Christian a lot. And also to Django [Reinhardt ]. It was just natural. I didn‚Äôt force it. I didn‚Äôt tell myself I‚Äôm going to make a Charlie Christian type song or do a Django song. I just wanted to do it. I‚Äôve played that stuff a lot and I wanted to write songs in that style.\\"from an interview on Americana Music Show #235, published on March 3, 2015.

The names were submitted in a sealed cover and not revealed to the public. However, the fact that a former union minister featured in the list became known and was reported by the press. One day before the list was submitted to the court, Preneet issued a statement saying that she had held a Swiss bank account for many years, and that this fact was known to the authorities. The statement also said that in 2011, Preneet had given clarifications to the finance ministry regarding this matter.

As a player, he was as a goalkeeper from 1988 to 2007. He notably played for Hull City and York City having also had spells with Glentoran, Ards, West Bromwich Albion, Nottingham Forest, Blackburn Rovers, Leicester City, Sheffield United, Grimsby Town, Macclesfield Town and Bury. Club career Born in Newtownards, County Down, Fettis started his career with Glentoran before playing for Ards from 1988 to 1991, making 65 appearances in all competitions for the club. He was a firm fans' favourite whilst at Hull City, and on occasion found himself playing as a striker due to injuries at the club, and bagged himself a couple of goals in the process. He later rejoined his manager at Hull, Terry Dolan at York City, where his saves were credited by many fans with keeping York in the league during a period in which they struggled financially. He was sold back to Hull by new manager Chris Brass in 2003; York dropped out of the league a year later, returning for the 2012‚Äì13 season. Fettis was signed by Bury on a 12-month deal in June 2006, but broke his right arm in a League Cup defeat against former side Sheffield United on 19 September. He was released by Bury at the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season. Coaching career Fettis was appointed as assistant goalkeeping coach at Derby County in July 2007. In November 2008, Fettis became the new goalkeeping coach and chief scout at Cheltenham Town. In July 2009, Fettis became the new goalkeeping coach at Sunderland. He joined Manchester United in January 2011 as a goalkeeping coach for the club's Academy teams. In July 2011, Fettis made an appearance for Manchester United Reserves after both reserve keepers fell ill before a match against Shrewsbury Town. In August 2016, former Barcelona goalkeeper V√≠ctor Vald√©s stated that without Fettis‚Äô help he would have given up on football in 2015. \\"It's difficult to explain, but it was hard being alone. The easy way out would have been to end my career.\\" \\"I want to say in a public way thank you to the U21 coach Alan Fettis - without him I may have given up football. He made me keep going and stopped me when I was thinking about bringing my career to an end.\\" \\"I feel like a professional goalkeeper again after all those hard days in Manchester,\\" he added. \\"But I don't have any bad words for Van Gaal or Manchester United. In 2019 after the sudden departure of Emilio Alvarez from the club Fettis temporarily stepped up to first team duties to support Senior Goalkeeping Coach Richard Hartis. Fettis returned to his role in the academy after the appointment of Craig Mawson from Burnley FC. International career Fettis was capped by Northern Ireland at schoolboy, under-16, under-17, under-18, B and senior levels.

He has also written puzzles for many other books and newspapers, such as Scott Kim's puzzle column for Discover magazine. Biography Farrell was born in Hastings, Nebraska, the oldest of three children to Belle Einsphar, and Paul Farrell, a third generation railroad man. Farrell himself worked for one summer on the railroad, as a \\"grinder\\", whose job was to plane down the railroad tracks so that they stayed smooth. He attended Hastings High School, graduating in 1955, and then going on to the University of Nebraska, graduating in 1963 with degrees in mathematics, chemistry, and physics. He later obtained a master's degree in mathematics, and in 1966 was hired as a teacher at Butler University in Indiana, where he worked for the next 40 years, teaching nearly every subject in the mathematics department. He officially retired in 1994, but has continued to teach every semester. He is best known for designing many crossword puzzles for The New York Times, starting in the 1970s for Margaret Farrar, and then continuing to design new puzzles after the department was taken over by Will Shortz. In 1996, he designed his most famous puzzle, the \\"Election Day\\" crossword. One of the words had the clue \\"lead story tomorrow\\", with the answer being 14 letters long. However, the puzzle had two correct solutions: One could be \\"Bob Dole elected\\", and the other could be Bill \\"Clinton elected\\", and all of the \\"crossing\\" words were designed such that they could be one of two different words, to make either answer as needed. Will Shortz called it an \\"amazing\\" feat, and said it's his favorite puzzle. With his wife Karen, Farrell has helped to organize the biannual Gathering for Gardner conferences, which started in 1993 as an invitation-only event for people connected with Martin Gardner.

He was inducted into the Steel Guitar Hall of Fame in 1994.The Steel Guitar Hall Of Fame  Early life  When Jernigan was nine years of age his father bought him his first steel guitar. By the time he was fourteen years old, he was playing on the weekends at VFW and Legion Halls in the Pensacola area.  Playing career  At the age of eighteen he had his first professional job in Ohio prior to being drafted in 1965 into the United States Army. Jernigan has toured as a backup player for David Houston, Faron Young, Ferlin Husky, Jack Greene, Johnny PayCheck, Little Jimmy Dickens, Lorrie Morgan, and Vassar Clements. In 1977, Jernigan became a Christian and began to play in church and still does today. He has recorded with Betty Jean Robinson, Joe Paul Nichols and many other gospel music groups. For his many accomplishments on the steel guitar, Doug was inducted into the International Steel Guitar Hall of Fame in 1994. The Steel Guitar Hall Of Fame Plaque reads: : DOUG JERNIGAN : CONCERT, SESSION AND MAJOR RECORDING ARTIST, HE HAS SHARED HIS KNOWLEDGE AND ADVANCED THE STEEL AND DOBRO INTO COUNTRY JAZZ. HE ACHIEVED SINGLE STRING DELIVERY BEYOND MERE RIFFS, BUT FOR COMPLETE TUNES, WITH FLOWING, SCORCHING SPEED. : BORN: JANUARY 5, 1946 PENSACOLA, FLORIDA INDUCTED: 1994 : source: http://www.scottysmusic.com/hofplq.htm Jernigan continues as a recording artist, session player, teacher of the steel guitar and talented musician. Tom Bradshaw quoted: : In the early '70s, I was bouncing around Nashville searching for good steel-men. With me was Sonny Curtis, at that time the steel player for George Jones' Jones Boys. We passed Demon's Den and heard some guy trying to play hoe-downs on steel, but wasn‚Äôt quite cutting it. Sonny and I elbowed our way inside and learned that the player was Jernigan. That was the first time I had heard Doug, although word of him had been circulating for some time. I commented to Sonny that no one would ever be able to play steel at the speed of a fiddle or banjo player, except for short riffs. I told Sonny, \\"The kid should give up trying.\\" Fortunately, Doug never heard my comment, not that he should have paid any attention. In his early years (1960s & '70s), Jernigan honed his skills as a backup player. In 1970 Ron Lashley of the Emmons Guitar Company recognized Doug's talent and produced his first album, Uptown To Country. Since then, Doug has recorded many more instrumental albums, shared billing on others, and has been the session steel guitarist on several recordings by such country music artists as Faron Young, Little Jimmy Dickins, Lorrie Morgan, and David Frizzell. Today, Doug tours as a concert performer, records with a host of Country Music artists and has plays on the Opry. He is also an accomplished Dobro player. His latest release is titled Doug Jernigan Plays Jazz Standards.

The site's Classical name appears to have been Sak-Nikte' ('White-Flower'). staircase riser showing a ball game scene. La Corona, 8th century. Height: 25.1 cm; length: 43.2 cm The search for 'Site Q' During the 1960s looted Maya reliefs referring to a then-unknown city surfaced on the international art market. One of these reliefs, showing a ball player, is now in the Chicago Art Institute; another is in the Dallas Museum of Art. Peter Mathews, then a Yale graduate student, dubbed the city \\"Site Q\\" (short for ¬øQu√©? [Spanish for \\"what?\\"]). Some researchers believed that the inscriptions referred to Calakmul, but the artistic style of the artifacts was different from anything that had been found there. Santiago Billy and Carlos Catalan, environmentalists studying scarlet macaws, came upon the remote ruins in 1996, and Ian Graham and David Stuart from Harvard University's Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology investigated the site the following year, naming the new site La Corona. Among the broken sculptures left by looters, Stuart found textual references to a place name and to historical figures that were featured on Site Q artifacts, leading him to believe that La Corona was Site Q. In 2005 Marcello A. Canuto, then a Yale professor, found a panel in situ at La Corona that mentioned two Site Q rulers. The panel had been quarried from the same rock as the Site Q artifacts, providing convincing evidence that La Corona was indeed Site Q. Maya glyphs discovered at La Corona. This particular panel helped point to La Corona as the long-sought \\"Site Q\\". The panel's left side depicts king K'inich Yook of Sak Nikte'. Recent research Since 2008, the site has been investigated by the La Corona Archaeological Project (PRALC) co-directed by Marcello A. Canuto (Director, Middle American Research Institute at Tulane University) and Tom√°s Barrientos (Director, Dept. of Archaeology, Universidad del Valle de Guatemala). In April 2012, PRALC discovered a row of 12 staircase risers with many different relief scenes; another 10 sculpted risers were found looted from their original context but then discarded for being too eroded to be worth selling on the illicit antiquities market. The texts of these newly discovered panels contain important historical information about political events in the Classic period; one of the panels (Hieroglyphic Staircase 2, Block 5) contains a reference to 4 Ahau 3 K'ank'in, the notorious 13th baktun-ending. La Corona and its history Research focuses on the relationship between the powerful kingdom of Calakmul and La Corona.Martin and Grube 2000: 100-113 A famous sculpted panel (now in the Dallas Museum of Art) depicts two large palanquins each carrying a royal woman from Calakmul, one standing in a temple pavilion, the other overshadowed by a supernatural protector; the text, however, refers to three women who came from Calakmul's ruling dynasty to marry the kings of La Corona.

It was listed on the London Stock Exchange until it was acquired by TDR Capital in November 2019. History In 1946 Royal Navy officer David Wickins decided to sell his Riley Lynx tourer. Placing an advert in the local newspaper, he offered to sell the car to the first person who turned up at his mother's house in Farnham, Surrey with ¬£200. Arriving home late, he found a crowd of eager buyers, and so auctioned the car off for ¬£420. Wickins then rented a farmer's field at Frimley Bridges, now under junction 4 of the M3 motorway, and set up his first public auction. The 14 cars auctioned sold for a total of ¬£8,250. Wickins and one of his brothers immediately founded Southern Counties Car Auctions, which, after exiting the Royal Navy shortly afterwards, he expanded across the UK by selling surplus ex-British Army and Royal Air Force vehicles for the Ministry of Defence. Renamed \\"British Car Auctions\\", Wickins then expanded the company across Europe and the United States through acquisition. This included the purchase of the car auctions division of British conglomerate Hawley Goodall, owned by Michael Ashcroft. This proved to be the start of a lifelong friendship between Wickins and Ashcroft, and through his Bermuda and Belize based holdings in various banks, Ashcroft would finance a number of Wickins' later business ventures. The company had head offices at the Frimley Bridges site, but later moved to purpose-built premises at Blackbushe Airport, Yateley to accommodate the now closed aviation division, which it still occupies. Employing 160 at its head office, Wickins built the company into the largest car auction business in the world before retiring in 1990. A near-scratch golfer, through this and his long association with the Conservative Party, Wickins met and befriended Denis Thatcher. Wickins later agreed to sponsor Mark Thatcher's motor racing activities in the 1980s through BCA. Denis Thatcher later served on one of Wickins' company boards, while Mark Thatcher served as chairman of Lotus Cars and later BCA in North America, which Wickins had led from near-bankruptcy to survival. In the late 1980s, Belize-based Hawley Goodall had undertaken a reverse takeover of ADT Security Services, and renamed itself ADT. As a result of its focus on security systems, ADT sold the North American and European arms of BCA in separate deals. While the residual North American arm was broken-up and sold to trade buyers, the European arm was acquired by a consortium of some 40 private investors, including Lord Ashcroft via his Belize-based investment company, in 1995. In September 2006, the European arm was bought by the investment banking arm of private bank Samuel Montagu & Co., a division of HSBC. In February 2010, BCA was acquired by the private equity investment firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice. Then in March 2015 Haversham Holdings, an investment business, undertook a reverse takeover of BCA and renamed itself BCA Marketplace. The company was acquired by TDR Capital in November 2019. Operations Belle Vue in Manchester The company operates the largest vehicle auction site in Europe and auctions over 50% of all cars sold by auction in the UK.

Someone who has been forced to convert to a different religion or irreligion may continue, covertly, to adhere to the beliefs and practices which were originally held, while outwardly behaving as a convert. Crypto-Jews, crypto-Christians, crypto-Muslims and crypto-Pagans are historical examples of the latter.  Religion and power  In general, anthropologists have shown that the relationship between religion and politics is complex, especially when viewed over the expanse of human history.Firth, Raymond (1981) Spiritual Aroma: Religion and Politics. American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 83, No. 3, pp. 582‚Äì601 While religious leaders and the state generally have different aims, both are concerned with power and order; both use reason and emotion to motivate behavior. Throughout history, leaders of religious and political institutions have cooperated, opposed one another, and or attempted to co-opt each other, for purposes which are both noble and base, and they have implemented programs with a wide range of driving values, from compassion which is aimed at alleviating current suffering to brutal change which is aimed at achieving long-term goals, for the benefit of groups ranging from small cliques to all of humanity. The relationship is far from simple. But religion has often been used coercively, and it has also used coercion.  Christianity  Christianity was a minority religion during much of the middle Roman Classical Period, and the early Christians were persecuted during that time. When Constantine I converted to Christianity, it had already grown to be the dominant religion of the Roman Empire. Already under the reign of Constantine I, Christian heretics were being persecuted; beginning in the late 4th century, the ancient pagan religions were also actively suppressed. In the view of many historians, the Constantinian shift turned Christianity from a persecuted religion into one capable of persecution and sometimes eager to persecute.see e.g. John Coffey, Persecution and Toleration on Protestant England 1558‚Äì1689, 2000, p.22  Late Antiquity  On 27 February 380, together with Gratian and Valentinian II, Theodosius I issued the decree Cunctos populos, the so-called Edict of Thessalonica, recorded in the Codex Theodosianus xvi.1.2. This declared Trinitarian Nicene Christianity to be the only legitimate imperial religion and the only one entitled to call itself Catholic. Other Christians he described as \\"foolish madmen\\". He also ended official state support for the traditional polytheist religions and customs. The Codex Theodosianus (Eng. Theodosian Code) was a compilation of the laws of the Roman Empire under the Christian emperors since 312. A commission was established by Theodosius II and his co-emperor Valentinian III on 26 March 429\\"Codex Theodosianus\\" in The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium, Oxford University Press, New York & Oxford, 1991, p. 475. LacusCurtius ‚Ä¢ Roman Law ‚Äî Theodosian Code (Smith's Dictionary, 1875) and the compilation was published by a constitution of 15 February 438. It went into force in the eastern and western parts of the empire on 1 January 439. > It is Our will that all the peoples who are ruled by the administration of > Our Clemency shall practice that religion which the divine Peter the Apostle > transmitted to the Romans.... The rest, whom We adjudge demented and insane, > shall sustain the infamy of heretical dogmas, their meeting places shall not > receive the name of churches, and they shall be smitten first by divine > vengeance and secondly by the retribution of Our own initiative (Codex > Theodosianus XVI 1.2.)., qtd. in Forced conversions of Jews were carried out with the support of rulers during Late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages in Gaul, the Iberian peninsula and in the Byzantine empire.  Medieval western Europe  During the Saxon Wars, Charlemagne, King of the Franks, forcibly converted the Saxons from their native Germanic paganism by way of warfare, and law upon conquest. Examples are the Massacre of Verden in 782, when Charlemagne reportedly had 4,500 captive Saxons massacred for rebelling, and the Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae, a law imposed on conquered Saxons in 785, after another rebellion and destruction of churches and killing of missionary priests and monks, that prescribed death to those who refused to convert to Christianity.For the Massacre of Verden, see Barbero, Alessandro (2004). Forced conversion that occurred after the seventh century generally took place during riots and massacres carried out by mobs and clergy without support of the rulers. In contrast, royal persecutions of Jews from the late eleventh century onward generally took the form of expulsions, with some exceptions, such as conversions of Jews in southern Italy of the 13th century, which were carried out by Dominican Inquisitors but instigated by King Charles II of Naples. Jews were forced to convert to Christianity by the Crusaders in Lorraine, on the Lower Rhine, in Bavaria and Bohemia, in Mainz and in Worms (see Rhineland massacres, Worms massacre (1096)). Pope Innocent III pronounced in 1201 that if one agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation, one nevertheless could be compelled to outwardly observe Christianity: > [T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical > jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be > reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to > be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and > wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. > For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of > unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones.

During the Northern Crusades against the pagan Balts and Slavs of northern Europe, forced conversions were a widely used tactic, which received papal sanction.Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 71 These tactics were first adopted during the Wendish Crusade, but became more widespread during the Livonian Crusade and Prussian Crusade, in which tactics included the killing of hostages, massacre, and the devastation of the lands of tribes that had not yet submitted.Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 95 Most of the populations of these regions were converted only after the repeated rebellion of native populations that did not want to accept Christianity even after initial forced conversion; in Old Prussia, the tactics employed in the initial conquest and subsequent conversion of the territory resulted in the death of most of the native population, whose language consequently became extinct.The German Hansa, P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge  Early modern Iberian peninsula  After the end of Islamic control of Spain, Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492. In Portugal, following an order for their expulsion in 1496, only a handful were allowed to leave and the rest were forced to convert. Muslims were expelled from Portugal in 1497, and they were gradually forced to convert in the constituent kingdoms of Spain. The forced conversion of Muslims was implemented in the Crown of Castile from 1500‚Äì02 and in the Crown of Aragon in the 1520s. After the conversions, the so-called \\"New Christians\\" were those inhabitants (Sephardic Jews or Mud√©jar Muslims) who were baptized under coercion and in the face of execution, becoming forced converts from Islam (Moriscos, Conversos and \\"secret Moors\\") or from Judaism (Conversos, Crypto- Jews and Marranos). After the forced conversion, when all former Muslims and Jews had ostensibly become Catholic, the Spanish Inquisition targeted primarily forced converts from Judaism and Islam, who came under suspicion of either continuing to adhere to their old religion or having fallen back into it. Jewish conversos still resided in Spain and often practised Judaism secretly and were suspected by the \\"Old Christians\\" of being Crypto-Jews. The Spanish Inquisition generated much wealth and income for the church and individual inquisitors by confiscating the property of the persecuted. The end of Al-Andalus and the expulsion of the Sephardic Jews from the Iberian Peninsula went hand in hand with the increase of Spanish and Portuguese influence in the world, as exemplified in the Christian conquest of the Americas and their aboriginal Indian population. The Ottoman Empire and Morocco absorbed most of the Jewish and Muslim refugees, although a large majority remained as Conversos. Austria The crypto-Protestant parents were taxed to pay for the Catholic institutionalization and education of their 289 children. Colonial Americas During the European colonization of the Americas, forced conversion of the continents' indigenous, non-Christian population was common, especially in South America and Mesoamerica, where the conquest of large indigenous polities like the Inca and Aztec Empires placed colonizers in control of large non-Christian populations. According to some South American leaders and indigenous groups, there were cases among native populations of conversion under the threat of violence, often because they were compelled to after being conquered, and that the Catholic Church cooperated with civil authority to achieve this end. Eastern Europe Upon converting to Christianity in the 10th century, Vladimir the Great, the ruler of Kievan Rus', ordered Kiev's citizens to undergo a mass baptism in the Dnieper river. In the 13th century the pagan populations of the Baltics faced campaigns of forcible conversion by crusading knight corps such as the Livonian Brothers of the Sword and the Teutonic Order, which often meant simply dispossessing these populations of their lands and property. After Ivan the Terrible's conquest of the Khanate of Kazan, the Muslim population faced slaughter, expulsion, forced resettlement and conversion to Christianity. In the 18th century, Elizabeth of Russia launched a campaign of forced conversion of Russia's non-Orthodox subjects, including Muslims and Jews.  Goa inquisition  The Portuguese practised religious persecution in Goa, India in the 16th and 17th centuries. The natives of Goa, most of them Hindus, were subjected to severe torture and oppression by the zealous Portuguese rulers and missionaries, and forcibly converted to Christianity.Of umbrellas, goddesses, and dreams: essays on Goan culture and society, 76-120, Robert Samuel Newman, 2001The Goa Inquisition, Being a Quatercentenary Commemoration Study of the Inquisition in India by Anant Priolkar, Bombay University PressEveryday Nationalism: Women of the Hindu Right in India Kalyani Devaki Menon, 2009Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bombay 1967M.

Baral, North Eastern Hill University. Dept. of Anthropology ‚Äì Social Science In 1567, the campaign to destroy temples in Bardez met with success, with 300 Hindu temples destroyed. Prohibition was laid from December 4, 1567 on rituals of Hindu marriages, sacred thread wearing and cremation. All persons above 15 years of age were compelled to listen to Christian preaching, failing which they were punished. In 1583, Hindu temples at Assolna and Cuncolim were destroyed by the Portuguese army. \\"The fathers of the Church forbade the Hindus under terrible penalties the use of their own sacred books, and prevented them from all exercise of their religion. They destroyed their temples, and so harassed and interfered with the people that they abandoned the city in large numbers, refusing to remain any longer in a place where they had no liberty, and were liable to imprisonment, torture and death if they worshiped after their own fashion the gods of their fathers\\", wrote Filippo Sassetti, who was in India from 1578 to 1588. An order was issued in June 1684 for suppressing the Konkani language and making it compulsory to speak Portuguese, on pain of severe penalties. All non-Christian cultural symbols and books written in local languages were also ordered to be destroyed.  Papal States  In 1858, Edgardo Mortara was taken from his Jewish parents and raised as a Catholic, because he'd been baptized by a maid without his parents' consent or knowledge. This incident was called the Mortara case. World War II During World War II, Orthodox Serbs were forcibly converted to Catholicism.  Hindus in India  In 2009, the Assam Times reported that a group of Hmar militants with about 15 members calling themselves the Manmasi National Christian Army, tried to force Hindu residents of Bhuvan Pahar, Assam to convert to Christianity.Christianity threat looms over Bhuvan Pahar Assam Times ‚Äì June 23, 2009  Hinduism  Indian Hindus have alleged that \\"radical Christian groups\\" in Odisha have forced Christian converts from Hinduism to \\"revert\\"the word revert is used in this context; not convert; see Older than the Church: Christianity and Caste in The God of Small Things India by A Sekhar;Washington post article to Hinduism. These \\"religious riots\\" were largely between two tribal groups in Odisha, one of which was predominantly Hindu and the other was predominantly Christian, over the assassination of a Hindu leader named Swami Lakshmanananda by Maoists who were operating as terrorist groups in India (see Naxalite). In the aftermath of the violence, American Christian evangelical groups have claimed that Hindu groups are \\"forcibly reverting\\" Christian converts from Hinduism back to Hinduism. It has also been alleged that these same Hindu groups have used allurements to convert poor Muslims and Christians to Hinduism against their will. Similarly, Hindus claim that Christian missionaries use money and free education to lure Hindus to convert to Christianity.Popular Christianity in India: Riting between the Lines, 259, Selva J. Raj, Corinne G. Dempsey, SUNY Press .  Islam  Islamic law prohibits forced conversion, following the Quranic principle that there is \\"no compulsion in religion\\" (),Winter, T. J., & Williams, J. A. (2002). Understanding Islam and the Muslims: The Muslim Family Islam and World Peace. Louisville, Kentucky: Fons Vitae. p. 82. . Quote: The laws of Muslim warfare forbid any forced conversions, and regard them as invalid if they occur. However, episodes of forced conversions have occurred in the history of Islam. Historians believe that forced conversion was rare in Islamic history,Waines (2003) \\"An Introduction to Islam\\" Cambridge University Press. p. 53 and most conversions to Islam were voluntary. Muslim rulers were often more interested in conquest than conversion. While Muslim scholars like Abu Hanifa and Abu Yusuf stated that the jizya tax should be paid by Non-Muslims (Kuffar) regardless of their religion, some later and more extremist Muslim jurists did not permit Non-Muslims to pay the jizya. Instead, they only allowed Non- Muslims to avoid death by choosing to convert to Islam. Of the four schools of Islamic jurisprudence, the Hanafi and Maliki schools allow polytheists to be granted dhimmi status, except Arab polytheists. However, the Shafi'i and Hanbali schools only consider Christians, Jews, and Zoroastrians to be eligible to belong to the dhimmi category. Wael Hallaq states that in theory, Islamic religious tolerance only applied to those religious groups that Islamic jurisprudence considered to be monotheistic \\"People of the Book\\", i.e. Christians, Jews, and Zoroastrians if they paid the jizya tax, while to those excluded from the \\"People of the Book\\" were only offered two choices: convert to Islam or fight to the death. In practice, the \\"People of the Book\\" designation and dhimmi status were even extended to the non-monotheistic religions of the conquered peoples, such as Hindus, Jains, Buddhists, and other non-monotheists. In recent times, forced conversions to Islam have been threatened or carried out in the context of war, insurgency and intercommunal violence. Cases affecting thousands of people are reported to have occurred during the Partition of India, the Bangladesh Liberation War, in Pakistan, and areas controlled by ISIS. Disputed allegations of forced conversion of young women have generated public controversy in Egypt and the United Kingdom.  Early period  The wars of the Ridda (lit. apostasy) undertaken by Abu Bakr, the first caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate, against Arab tribes who had accepted Islam but refused to recognize his caliphal authority, have been described by some historians as an instance of forced conversion or \\"reconversion\\". The rebellion of these Arab tribes was less a relapse to the pre-Islamic Arabian religion than termination of a political contract they had made with Muhammad. Two out of the four schools of Islamic law, i.e. Hanafi and Maliki schools, accepted non-Arab polytheists to be eligible for the dhimmi status. Under this doctrine, Arab polytheists were forced to choose between conversion and death. However, according to perception of most Muslim jurists, all Arabs had embraced Islam during the lifetime of Muhammad. Their exclusion therefore had little practical significance after his death in 632. In the 9th century, the Samaritan population of Palestine faced persecution and attempts at forced conversion at the hands of the rebel leader ibn FirƒÅsa, against whom they were defended by Abbasid caliphal troops.  Almohad dynasty  There were forced conversions in the 12th century under the Almohad dynasty of North Africa and al-Andalus, who suppressed the dhimmi status of Jews and Christians and gave them the choice between conversion, exile, and being killed. Christians under their rule generally chose to relocate to the Christian principalities in the north of the Iberian Peninsula, whereas Jews decided to stay in order to keep their properties, and many of them feigned conversion to Islam, while continuing to believe and practice Judaism in secrecy. During the Almohad persecution, the medieval Jewish philosopher and rabbi Moses Maimonides (1135‚Äì1204), one of the leading exponents of the Golden Age of Jewish culture in the Iberian Peninsula, wrote his Epistle on Apostasy, in which he permitted Jews to feign apostasy under duress, though strongly recommending leaving the country instead. There is dispute amongst scholars as to whether Maimonides himself converted to Islam in order to freely escape from Almohad territory, and then reconverted back to Judaism in either the Levant or in Egypt. He was later denounced as an apostate and tried in an Islamic court. Yemen In the late 1160s, the Yemenite ruler 'Abd-al-Nabƒ´ ibn Mahdi left Jews with the choice between conversion to Islam or martyrdom.The Epistles of Maimonides: Crisis and Leadership, ed.:Abraham S. Halkin, David Hartman, Jewish Publication Society, 1982. p.91 Ibn Mahdi also imposed his beliefs upon the Muslims besides the Jews. This led to a revival of Jewish messianism, but also led to mass- conversion. The persecution ended in 1173 with the defeat of Ibn Mahdi and conquest of Yemen by the brother of Saladin, and they were allowed to return to their Jewish faith. According to two Cairo Genizah documents, the Ayyubid ruler of Yemen, al-Malik al-Mu'izz al-Ismail (reigned from 1197-1202) had attempted to force the Jews of Aden to convert. The second document details the relief of Jewish community after his murder, and those who had been forced to convert reverted to Judaism. While he didn't impose Islam upon the foreign merchants, they were forced to pay triple the normal rate of poll tax. A measure listed in the legal works by Al-ShawkƒÅnƒ´ is of forced conversion of Jewish orphans. No date is given for this decree by modern studies nor who issued it. The forced conversion of Jewish orphans was reintroduced under Imam Yahya in 1922. The Orphans' Decree was implemented aggressively for the first ten years. It was re-promulgated in 1928.  Ottoman Empire  Registration of boys for the dev≈üirme. Ottoman miniature painting from the S√ºleymanname, 1558. A form of forced conversion became institutionalized during the Ottoman Empire in the practice of dev≈üirme, a human levy in which Christian boys were seized and collected from their families (usually in the Balkans), enslaved, converted to Islam, and then trained as elite military unit within the Ottoman army or for high-ranking service to the sultan. From the mid to late 14th, through early 18th centuries, the dev≈üirme‚Äìjanissary system enslaved an estimated 500,000 to one million non-Muslim adolescent males.A. E. Vacalopoulos. The Greek Nation, 1453‚Äì1669, New Brunswick, New Jersey, Rutgers University Press, 1976, p. 41; Vasiliki Papoulia, The Impact of Devshirme on Greek Society, in War and Society in East Central Europe, Editor‚Äîin‚ÄîChief, Bela K. Kiraly, 1982, Vol. II, pp. 561‚Äî562. These boys would attain a great education and high social standing after their training and conversion. In the 17th century, Sabbatai Zevi, a Sephardic Jew whose ancestors were welcomed in the Ottoman Empire during the Spanish Inquisition, proclaimed himself as the Jewish Messiah and called for the abolition of major Jewish laws and customs. After he attracted a large following, he was arrested by the Ottoman authorities and given a choice between execution or conversion to Islam. Zevi opted for a feigned conversion solely to escape the death penalty, and continued to believe and practice Judaism along with his followers in secrecy. During the genocide and persecution of Greeks in the 20th century, there were cases of forced conversion to Islam (see also Armenian Genocide, Assyrian Genocide, and Hamidian massacres).  Persia  Ismail I, the founder of the Safavid dynasty, decreed Twelver Shiism to be the official religion of state and ordered executions of a number of Sunni intellectuals who refused to accept Shiism. Non-Muslims faced frequent persecutions and at times forced conversions under the rule of his dynastic successors.Lewis, Bernard (1984). The Jews of Islam. Princeton: Princeton University Press. . p.52 Thus, after the capture of the Hormuz Island, Abbas I required local Christians to convert to Islam, Abbas II granted his ministers authority to force Jews to become Muslims, and Sultan Husayn decreed forcible conversion of Zoroastrians. In 1839, during the Qajar era the Jewish community in the city of Mashhad was attacked by a mob and subsequently forced to convert to Islam. India In an invasion of the Kashmir valley (1015), Mahmud of Ghazni plundered the valley, took many prisoners and carried out conversions to Islam. In his later campaigns, in Mathura, Baran and Kanauj, again, many conversions took place. Those soldiers who surrendered to him were converted to Islam. In Baran (Bulandshahr) alone 10,000 persons were converted to Islam including the king. Tarikh-i-Yamini, Rausat-us-Safa and Tarikh-i-Ferishtah speak of construction of mosques and schools and appointment of preachers and teachers by Mahmud and his successor Masud. Wherever Mahmud went, he insisted on the people to convert to Islam. The raids by Muhammad Ghori and his generals brought in thousands of slaves in the late 12th century, most of whom were compelled to convert as one of the preconditions of their freedom.Habibullah, The Foundation of Muslim Rule in India, (Allahabad, 1961), pp.69 and 334Hasan Nizami, Taj-ul-Maasir, II, p.216Titus, Murray. Islam in India and Pakistan, (Calcutta, 1959), p.31 Sikandar Butshikan (1394-1417) demolished Hindu temples and forcefully converted Hindus. Aurangzeb employed a number of means to encourage conversions to Islam. In a Mughal-Sikh war in 1715, 700 followers of Banda Singh Bahadur were beheaded. Sikhs were executed for not apostatizing from Sikhism. Banda Singh Bahadur was offered a pardon if he converted to Islam. Upon refusal, he was tortured, and was killed with his 5 year old son. Following the execution of Banda, the emperor ordered to apprehend Sikhs anywhere they were found. 18th century ruler Tipu Sultan persecuted the Hindus, Christians and Mappla Muslims. During Sultan's Mysorean invasion of Kerala, hundreds of temples and churches were demolished and ten thousands of Christians and Hindus were killed or converted to Islam by force.  Contemporary   Bangladesh  In Bangladesh, the International Crimes Tribunal tried and convicted several leaders of the Islamic Razakar militias, as well as Bangladesh Muslim Awami league (Forid Uddin Mausood), of war crimes committed against Hindus during the 1971 Bangladesh genocide. The charges included forced conversion of Bengali Hindus to Islam.  India  In the 1998 Prankote massacre, 26 Kashmiri Hindus were beheaded by Islamist militants after their refusal to convert to Islam. The militants struck when the villagers refused demands from the gunmen to convert to Islam and prove their conversion by eating beef. 26 Hindus beheeaded by Islamist militants in Kashmir During the Noakhali riots in 1946, several thousand Hindus were forcibly converted to Islam by Muslim mobs.  Pakistan  The rise of Taliban insurgency in Pakistan has been an influential and increasing factor in the persecution of and discrimination against religious minorities, such as Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, and other minorities.Extremists Make Inroads in Pakistan' The Human Rights Council of Pakistan has reported that cases of forced conversion are increasing. A 2014 report by the Movement for Solidarity and Peace (MSP) says about 1,000 women in Pakistan are forcibly converted to Islam every year (700 Christian and 300 Hindu). In 2003 a six-year-old Sikh girl was kidnapped by a member of the Afridi tribe in Northwest Frontier Province; the alleged kidnapper claimed the girl was actually 12-years-old, and had converted to Islam so therefore could not be returned to her non- Muslim family. In May 2007, members of the Christian community of Charsadda in the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan, close to the border of Afghanistan, reported that they had received letters threatening bombings if they did not convert to Islam, and that the police were not taking their fears seriously. In June 2009, International Christian Concern (ICC) reported the rape and killing of a Christian man in Pakistan, for refusing to convert to Islam. Rinkle Kumari, a 19-year Pakistani student, Lata Kumari, and Asha Kumari, a Hindu working in a beauty parlor, were allegedly forced to convert from Hinduism to Islam. They told the judge that they wanted to go with their parents. Their cases were appealed all the way to the Supreme Court of Pakistan. The appeal was admitted but remained unheard ever after. Rinkle was abducted by a gang and \\"forced\\" to convert to Islam, before being head shaved. Sikhs in Hangu district stated they were being pressured to convert to Islam by Yaqoob Khan, the assistant commissioner of Tall Tehsil, in December 2017. However, the Deputy Commissioner of Hangu Shahid Mehmood denied it occurred and claimed that Sikhs were offended during a conversation with Yaqub though it wasn't intentional. Many Hindu girls living in Pakistan are kidnapped, forcibly converted and married to Muslims.Forced conversions torment Pakistan's Hindus India Al Jazeera According to the Pakistan Hindu Council, religious persecution, especially forced conversions, remains the foremost reason for migration of Hindus from Pakistan. Religious institutions like Bharchundi Sharif and Sarhandi Pir support forced conversions and are known to have support and protection of ruling political parties of Sindh.https://dailytimes.com.pk/116289/forced-conversions-of-pakistani-hindu- girls/ According to the National Commission of Justice and Peace and the Pakistan Hindu Council (PHC) around 1000 Christian and Hindu minority women are converted to Islam and then forcibly married off to their abductors or rapists.

On May 14, 35 Hindus of the same family were forced to convert by their employer because his sales dropped after Muslims started boycotting his eatable items as they were prepared by Hindus as well as their persecution by the Muslim employees of neighbouring shops according to their relatives. Since the impoverished Hindu had no other way to earn and needed to keep the job to survive, they converted. 14 members of the another family converted on May 17 since no one was employing them, later another Hindu man and his family of eight under pressure from Muslims to avoid their land being grabbed. In 2017, the Sikh community in Hangu district of Pakistan's Khyber- Pakhtunkhwa province alleged that they were \\"being forced to convert to Islam\\" by a government official.

These converts are also given land and money. For example, 428 poor Hindus in Matli were converted between 2009 and 2011 by the Madrassa Baitul Islam, a Deobandi seminary in Matli, which pays off the debts of Hindus converting to Islam.https://tribune.com.pk/story/324799/mass-conversions-for-matlis-poor- hindus-lakshmi-lies-in-another-religion/ Another example is the conversion of 250 Hindus to Islam in Chohar Jamali area in Thatta.https://nation.com.pk/16-Sep-2017/250-hindus-convert-to-islam-in-thatta Conversions are also carried out by Ex Hindu Baba Deen Mohammad Shaikh mission which converted 108,000 people to Islam since 1989.https://tribune.com.pk/story/325623/100000-conversions-and-counting-meet- the-ex-hindu-who-herds-souls-to-the-hereafter/ Within Pakistan, the province of the southern Sindh had over 1,000 forced conversions of Christian and Hindu girls according to the annual report of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan in 2018. According to victims' families and activists, Mian Abdul Haq, who is a local political and religious leader in Sindh, has been accused of being responsible for forced conversions of girls within the province. More than 100 Hindus in Sindh converted to Islam in June 2020 to escape discrimination and economic pressures. Islamic charities and clerics offer incentives of jobs or land to impoverished minorities on the condition that they convert. New York Times summarised the view of Hindu groups that these seemingly voluntary conversions \\"take place under such economic duress that they are tantamount to a forced conversion anyway.\\"  Indonesia  In 2012, over 1000 Catholic children in East Timor, removed from their families, were reported to being held in Indonesia without consent of their parents, forcibly converted to Islam, educated in Islamic schools and naturalized. Other reports claim forced conversion of minority Ahmadiyya sect Muslims to Sunni Islam, with the use of violence. Alt URL In 2001 the Indonesian army evacuated hundreds of Christian refugees from the remote Kesui and Teor islands in Maluku after the refugees stated that they had been forced to convert to Islam. According to reports, some of the men had been circumcised against their will, and a paramilitary group involved in the incident confirmed that circumcisions had taken place while denying any element of coercion.Maluku refugees allege forced circumcision, BBC News Online, Wednesday, January 31, 2001 In 2017, many members of the Orang Rimba tribe, especially children, were being forced to renounce their folk religion and convert to Islam.  Middle-East  There have been a number of reports of attempts to forcibly convert religious minorities in Iraq. The Yazidi people of northern Iraq, who follow an ethnoreligious syncretic faith, have been threatened with forced conversion by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, who consider their practices to be Satanism. UN investigators have reported mass killings of Yazidi men and boys who refused to convert to Islam. In Baghdad, hundreds of Assyrian Christians fled their homes in 2007 when a local extremist group announced that they had to convert to Islam, pay the jizya or die. In March 2007 the BBC reported that people in the Mandaean ethnic and religious minority in Iraq alleged that they were being targeted by Islamist insurgents, who offered them the choice of conversion or death. Allegations of Coptic Christian girls being forced to marry Arab Muslim men and convert to Islam in Egypt have been reported by a number of news and advocacy organizations and have sparked public protests.Heba Saleh (BBC News, Cairo), 'Conversion' sparks Copt protest. BBC News Online December 9, 2004. According to a 2009 report by the US State Department, observers have found it extremely difficult to determine whether compulsion was used, and in recent years no such cases have been independently verified. In 2006 two journalists of the Fox News Network were kidnapped at gunpoint in the Gaza Strip by a previously unknown militant group. After being forced to read statements on videotape proclaiming that they had converted to Islam, they were released by their captors.  Africa  In August 2009, International Christian Concern reported that four Christians working to help orphans in Somalia were beheaded by Islamist extremists when they refused to convert to Islam. In the early 2010s, the Nigerian extremist group Boko Haram is reported to have forced a kidnapped Christian woman to convert to Islam at knifepoint.'Convert or die,' Nigerian terrorist group Boko Haram tells Christian women Fox News (November 2013) A Christian woman in 2018 was raped repeatedly by a Boko Haram terrorist for refusing to convert to Islam and her son was killed. In 2015 a Christian girl named Ese Oruru was kidnapped in Bayelsa State and transported to Kano where she was forced to convert to Islam and marry a Muslim man in the palace of the Emir of Kano, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi.  United Kingdom  According to the UK prison officers' union, some Muslim prisoners in the UK have been forcibly converting fellow inmates to Islam in prisons. In 2007 a Sikh girl's family claimed that she had been forcibly converted to Islam, and they received a police guard after being attacked by an armed gang, although the \\"Police said no one was injured in the incident\\". In response to these news stories, an open letter to Sir Ian Blair, signed by ten Hindu academics, argued that claims that Hindu and Sikh girls were being forcefully converted were \\"part of an arsenal of myths propagated by right-wing Hindu supremacist organisations in India\\". The Muslim Council of Britain issued a press release pointing out there is a lack of evidence of any forced conversions and suggested it is an underhand attempt to smear the British Muslim population. An academic paper by Katy Sian published in the journal South Asian Popular Culture in 2011 explored the question of how \\"'forced' conversion narratives\\" arose around the Sikh diaspora in the United Kingdom. Sian, who reports that claims of conversion through courtship on campuses are widespread in the UK, indicates that rather than relying on actual evidence they primarily rest on the word of \\"a friend of a friend\\" or on personal anecdote. According to Sian, the narrative is similar to accusations of \\"white slavery\\" lodged against the Jewish community and foreigners to the UK and the US, with the former having ties to anti-semitism that mirror the Islamophobia betrayed by the modern narrative. Sian expanded on these views in 2013's Mistaken Identities, Forced Conversions, and Postcolonial Formations. In 2018, a report entitled ‚ÄúThe Religiously Aggravated Sexual Exploitation of Young Sikh Women Across the UK\\" showed similarities between the case of Sikh Women and the Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal.https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands- news/sikh-girls-abused-grooming-gangs-15492360  Judaism  Forced conversions occurred under the Hasmonean Kingdom.

Attridge claims that \\"there is reason to think that Josephus' account of their conversion is substantially accurate.\\" He also writes: \\"that these were not isolated instances, but that forced conversion was a national policy, is clear from the fact that Alexander Jannaeus (around 80 BC) demolished the city of Pella in Moab, 'because the inhabitants would not agree to adopt the national custom of the Jews.'\\" Josephus, Antiquities. 13.15.4.Harold W.

The BBC stated that \\"The production team spoke to many historians over 18 months, among them Nigel Groom, who was our consultant, and Professor Abdul Rahman Al-Ansary [former professor of archaeology at the King Saud University in Riyadh].\\" Inscriptions documented by Yousef himself show the great pride he expressed after massacring more than 22,000 Christians in Zafar and Najran.Jacques Ryckmans, La pers√©cution des chr√©tiens himyarites au sixi√®me si√®cle, Nederlands Historisch-Archaeologisch Inst. in het Nabije Oosten, 1956 pp 1-24  Atheism  St. Theodora Church in downtown Chi≈üinƒÉu was converted into the city's Museum of Scientific Atheism\\". ‚ÄîAndrei Brezianu  Eastern Bloc  Under the doctrine of state atheism in the Soviet Union, there was a \\"government-sponsored program of forced conversion to atheism\\" conducted by Communists.Religion and the State in Russia and China: Suppression, Survival, and Revival, by Christopher Marsh, page 47.

Leaders of the national Orthodox Churches in Romania and Bulgaria had to be cautious and submissive\\", wrote Blainey. While the churches were generally not as severely treated as they had been in the USSR, nearly all their schools and many of their churches were closed, and they lost their formerly prominent roles in public life. Children were taught atheism, and clergy were imprisoned by the thousands.Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p.508 In the Eastern Bloc, Christian churches, Jewish synagogues and Islamic mosques were forcibly \\"converted into museums of atheism.\\" Historical essayist Andrei Brezianu expounds upon this situation, specifically in the Socialist Republic of Romania, writing that scientific atheism was \\"aggressively applied to Moldova, immediately after the 1940 annexation, when churches were profaned, clergy assaulted, and signs and public symbols of religion were prohibited\\"; he provides an example of this phenomenon, further writing that \\"St. Theodora Church in downtown Chi≈üinƒÉu was converted into the city's Museum of Scientific Atheism\\". Marxist-Leninist regimes treated religious believers as subversives or abnormal, sometimes relegating them to psychiatric hospitals and reeducation. Nevertheless, historian Emily Baran writes that \\"some accounts suggest the conversion to militant atheism did not always end individuals' existential questions\\".  French Revolution  During the French Revolution, a campaign of dechristianization happened which included removal and destruction of religious objects from places of worship; English librarian Thomas Hartwell Horne and biblical scholar Samuel Davidson write that \\"churches were converted into 'temples of reason,' in which atheistical and licentious homilies were substituted for the proscribed service\\".Latreille, A.

Although brief, the French experiment was particularly notable for the influence upon atheists Ludwig Feuerbach, Sigmund Freud and Karl Marx. East Asia The emergence of Communist states across East Asia after World War Two saw religion purged by atheist regimes across China, North Korea and much of Indo-China.Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p.508 In 1949, China became a Communist state under the leadership of Mao Zedong's Communist Party of China. Prior to this takeover, China itself was previously a cradle of religious thought since ancient times, being the birthplace of Confucianism and Daoism, and Buddhists arrived in the first century AD. Under Mao, China became an officially atheist state, and though some religious practices were permitted to continue under State supervision, religious groups which are deemed a threat to law and order have been suppressed‚Äîsuch as Tibetan Buddhism from 1959 and Falun Gong in recent years.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online - China: Religion; accessed 10 November 2013 Religious schools and social institutions were closed, foreign missionaries were expelled, and local religious practices were discouraged. During the Cultural Revolution, Mao instigated \\"struggles\\" against the Four Olds: \\"old ideas, customs, culture, and habits of mind\\".Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online - China - History: Cultural Revolution; accessed 10 November 2013 In 1999, the Communist Party launched a three-year drive to promote atheism in Tibet, saying that intensifying atheist propaganda is \\"especially important for Tibet because atheism plays an extremely important role in promoting economic construction, social advancement and socialist spiritual civilization in the region\\".China announces \\"civilizing\\" atheism drive in Tibet; BBC; January 12, 1999 As of November 2018, in present-day China, the government has detained many people in internment camps, \\"where Uighur Muslims are remade into atheist Chinese subjects\\". For children who were forcibly taken away from their parents, the Chinese government has established \\"orphanages\\" with the aim of \\"converting future generations of Uighur Muslim children into loyal subjects who embrace atheism\\".  Revolutionary Mexico  Articles 3, 5, 24, 27, and 130 of the Mexican Constitution of 1917 as originally enacted were anticlerical and enormously restricted religious freedoms.Soberanes Fernandez, Jose Luis, Mexico and the 1981 United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, pp. 437-438 nn. 7-8, BYU Law Review, June 2002 At first the anticlerical provisions were only sporadically enforced, but when President Plutarco El√≠as Calles took office, he enforced the provisions strictly. Calles' Mexico has been characterized as an atheist stateHaas, Ernst B., Nationalism, Liberalism, and Progress: The dismal fate of new nations, Cornell Univ. Press 2000 and his program as being one to eradicate religion in Mexico.Cronon, E. David \\"American Catholics and Mexican Anticlericalism, 1933-1936\\", pp. 205-208, Mississippi Valley Historical Review, XLV, Sept. 1948 All religions had their properties expropriated, and these became part of government wealth. There was a forced expulsion of foreign clergy and the seizure of Church properties. Article 27 prohibited any future acquisition of such property by the churches, and prohibited religious corporations and ministers from establishing or directing primary schools. This second prohibition was sometimes interpreted to mean that the Church could not give religious instruction to children within the churches on Sundays, seen as destroying the ability of Catholics to be educated in their own religion. The Constitution of 1917 also closed and forbade the existence of monastic orders (article 5), forbade any religious activity outside of church buildings (now owned by the government), and mandated that such religious activity would be overseen by the government (article 24). On June 14, 1926, President Calles enacted anticlerical legislation known formally as The Law Reforming the Penal Code and unofficially as the Calles Law.Joes, Anthony James Resisting Rebellion: The History And Politics of Counterinsurgency p. 70, (2006 University Press of Kentucky) His anti- Catholic actions included outlawing religious orders, depriving the Church of property rights and depriving the clergy of civil liberties, including their right to a trial by jury (in cases involving anti-clerical laws) and the right to vote.Tuck, Jim THE CRISTERO REBELLION ‚Äì PART 1 Mexico Connect 1996 Catholic antipathy towards Calles was enhanced because of his vocal atheism. He was also a Freemason.Denslow, William R. 10,000 Famous Freemasons p. 171 (2004 Kessinger Publishing) Regarding this period, recent President Vicente Fox stated, \\"After 1917, Mexico was led by anti-Catholic Freemasons who tried to evoke the anticlerical spirit of popular indigenous President Benito Ju√°rez of the 1880s. But the military dictators of the 1920s were a more savage lot than Juarez.\\"Fox, Vicente and Rob Allyn Revolution of Hope p. 17, Viking, 2007 Cristeros hanged in Jalisco. Due to the strict enforcement of anti-clerical laws, people in strongly Catholic areas, especially the states of Jalisco, Zacatecas, Guanajuato, Colima and Michoac√°n, began to oppose him, and this opposition led to the Cristero War from 1926 to 1929, which was characterized by brutal atrocities on both sides. Some Cristeros applied terrorist tactics, while the Mexican government persecuted the clergy, killing suspected Cristeros and supporters and often retaliating against innocent individuals.Calles, Plutarco El√≠as The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001‚Äì05 Columbia University Press. On May 28, 1926, Calles was awarded a medal of merit from the head of Mexico's Scottish rite of Freemasonry for his actions against the Catholics.The Cristeros: 20th century Mexico's Catholic uprising, from The Angelus, January 2002, Volume XXV, Number 1 by Olivier LELIBRE, The Angelus A truce was negotiated with the assistance of U.S. Ambassador Dwight Whitney Morrow. Calles, however, did not abide by the terms of the truce ‚Äì in violation of its terms, he had approximately 500 Cristero leaders and 5,000 other Cristeros shot, frequently in their homes in front of their spouses and children. Particularly offensive to Catholics after the supposed truce was Calles' insistence on a complete state monopoly on education, suppressing all Catholic education and introducing \\"socialist\\" education in its place: \\"We must enter and take possession of the mind of childhood, the mind of youth\\". The persecution continued as Calles maintained control under his Maximato and did not relent until 1940, when President Manuel √Åvila Camacho, a believing Catholic, took office. This attempt to indoctrinate the youth in atheism was begun in 1934 by amending Article 3 to the Mexican Constitution to eradicate religion by mandating \\"socialist education\\", which \\"in addition to removing all religious doctrine\\" would \\"combat fanaticism and prejudices\\", \\"build[ing] in the youth a rational and exact concept of the universe and of social life\\". In 1946 this \\"socialist education\\" was removed from the constitution and the document returned to the less egregious generalized secular education. The effects of the war on the Church were profound. Between 1926 and 1934 at least 40 priests were killed. Where there were 4,500 priests operating within the country before the rebellion, in 1934 there were only 334 priests licensed by the government to serve fifteen million people, the rest having been eliminated by emigration, expulsion, and assassination.Scheina, Robert L.

The gardens were selected by the British Tourist Authority as one of the Top 100 gardens in the UK\\"Dyffryn Gardens and Arboretum\\" at dyffryngardens.org.uk and are in the care of the National Trust. History of the Dyffryn Estate The Dyffryn Estate dates back to 640 A.D. when the Manor of Worlton (also known as Worleton), which included St Lythans and St Nicholas, was granted to Bishop Oudoceus of Llandaff. In the 16th century the Manor of Worlton was rented under copyhold by the Button family, who are believed to have first settled at the manor at Dog Hill in Dyffryn.Lloyd (1958), pg 60. The family's next residence, Columbar, was thought to be built on the location of Dyffryn Gardens. The Button family occupied the estate for a number of generations, producing Admiral Thomas Button who become a notable early explorer. The name of the Manor of Worlton was changed to the Manor of Dyffryn, St Nicholas in the 18th century when the Dyffryn Estate was sold to Thomas Pryce, who built the second building to be known as Dyffryn House, a Georgian manor, on the site in 1749.(The first house known as Dyffryn House is located in St David's Place, Goodwick and dates back to 1595.) Although no extensive work was undertaken to the grounds, Pryce did begin some additions, including the construction of the walled garden, dipping pools and some ornamental plantings. In 1891 the Dyffryn Estate was sold to John Cory by the then owner, a banker named Henry Ellis Collins. Cory then began construction of the present house in 1893. Later, Thomas Mawson, a well-known landscape architect and first president of the Institute of Landscape Architecture, was commissioned to design a garden to complement the new house; landscaping began in 1894 and was completed in 1909.Davies (2008), pg 945. Dyffryn Gardens in 2010 After John Cory's death in 1910, the job of further developing the gardens fell to Cory's third son, Reginald, who had inherited the estate. Reginald was a leading figure in the Royal Horticultural Society and a keen horticulturalist and plant collector who during the early 1900s jointly sponsored several worldwide plant hunting expeditions. Many of the plants on display at Dyffryn exist as a direct result of these forays, the most outstanding being Acer griseum (Paper Bark Maple) grown from seed brought back from China by the famous plant hunter Ernest Wilson. On Reginald's death in 1934, the Dyffryn Estate was passed to his sister Florence. On her death in 1937, the estate was bought by Sir Cennydd Traherne. In 1939 Sir Cennydd Traherne leased the Dyffryn House and Gardens to Glamorgan County Council, as a botanical garden on a 999-year lease. In 1973, the gardens were used as the venue to host a garden party to commemorate the dissolution of Glamorgan County Council. In 1995 Sir Cennydd Traherne died, and in 1999 his nephew Councillor Rhodri Llewellyn Traherne sold the freehold of Dyffryn House and Gardens to the Vale of Glamorgan for the sum of ¬£300,000. In 2000 Cadw awarded these gardens Grade II status in its register of landscapes, parks and gardens of special historical interest in Wales. The Grade I citation reads \\"The gardens at Dyffryn are the grandest and most outstanding Edwardian gardens in Wales. They are comparable to some of the most extravagant gardens of the period in Britain.\\" Dyffryn House and Gardens underwent restoration in 2006 with a ¬£8 million grant, ¬£6.15 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund, and the Grade II listed Edwardian gardens have been restored to the original design drawn up by Thomas Mawson in 1904 for the coal baron John Cory. The National Trust took over stewardship of Dyffryn House and Gardens on a 50-year lease from the Vale of Glamorgan Council in January 2013.\\"Dyffryn Gardens news update\\" at nationaltrust.org.uk\\"Glorious gardens start out on a new journey\\" Dyffryn House The present Dyffryn House was built in 1893‚Äì94 under the ownership of John Cory, by architect E.A. Lansdowne of Newport,Newman (1995), pg 341. and was one of the last large country manors to be built in Wales.Davies (2008), pg 946. A long narrow mansion, the architectural style is vaguely Second French Empire The main entrance, located on the north side of the building, is protected by a porte-cochere, which leads into a lofty hall. The windows looking out over the driveway from the Hall depict Elizabeth I at Tilbury. The hall also features the most notable of the manor's impressive chimneypieces; incorporating at its centre a late 17th-century marble cartouche of arms flanked by life-size wooden Mannerist figures of Ceres and Prudence. Other rooms of note include the Oak Room, whose chimneypiece is flanked by cross-legged cherubim, each with six wings. The drawing room and boudoir have Jacobean alabaster mantle-pieces. Despite its grand features, the house was used as a police training centre, and up until 1996 a conference centre. In 2007, the Vale of Glamorgan Council appointed ¬£1.4 million to repair and maintain Dyffryn House's walls and roof. As of 2012 the house is being extensively restored and was opened to the public in March 2013. Today, Dyffryn Gardens is a visitor attraction open all year round, 363 days a year. The gardens are accessed via the admissions building, which also houses a shop and an attached tea-room. From here the gardens are divided into three main areas, the arboretum, Dyffryn House and its lawns and the Garden Rooms. The eastern and largest section of the gardens contains the arboretum that begins with the kennel bank, leading to the rockery. The central section, which divides the arboretum in the east from the Garden Rooms to the west, contains Dyffryn House and its lawns, beginning with the house to the north extending southwards to the Vine Walk, a series of arches each containing a different species of vine. The two main lawns include the croquet lawn, closest to Dyffryn House, which runs east to west parallel to the main building, and the Great Lawn. The Great Lawn runs north‚Äìsouth and at its centre a longitudinal canal, which has at its centre a large bronze fountain. The fountain is in Chinese style and has a bronze Chinese Dragon wrapped around it; thought to be from the 1950s.Newman (1995), pg 342. The Great Lawn ends with a fountain pool, for which there is currently a fundraising drive to repair. The two bronze statues, Fujin and Raijin, Japanese Shinto gods of wind and lightning, that used to be here are now housed in the glass houses. At the southern end of the lawns is the Vine Walk, and Lavender Garden, the latter containing a red brick folly. The final section of the gardens is the Garden Rooms, a series of terraced themed gardens. The \\"rooms\\" contain an Italian Terrace, Australasian and Mediterranean Gardens, each containing plants from their respective regions. Other areas include a physic garden, rose garden, reflecting pool and Pompeian gardens. The Pompeiian gardens, entered via an archway dated 1909, were originally inspired by Reginald Cory's trips to Italy. Throughout the gardens are statues, many with a motif of people with animals. These include a life-size prone stone lion, a terracotta statue of a palm-bearing female, signed \\"E. Kuhse\\", (1881) of German origin and to the rear of the house outside the visitor centre is a large bronze of a mandarin riding a bull. Lordship and Manor of Worlton The Manor of Worlton (or Worelton) has existed since 640 AD when it was passed to the Bishop of Llandaff, who in 1913 transferred the ownership of the Lordship and Manor (also known the Manor of Dyffryn St Nicholas) to the University of Wales. In June 2000 the University, on behalf of the Bishop, sold the ancient manorial Lordship at auction. It was bought by local land owner Sean Thomas Arthur Rafferty, who thus became Lord of Dyffryn, Worlton and St. Nicholas.

Photo by Steven Moore Chandler Brossard (July 18, 1922 ‚Äì August 29, 1993) was an American novelist, writer, editor, and teacher. He wrote or edited a total of 17 books. With a challenging style and outsider characters, Brossard had limited critical success in the United States. His novels were more appreciated in France and Great Britain. His early works have been described as \\"landmarks of the postwar American novel.\\" Since 2000, three of his novels have been reprinted. Early life and education Brossard was born in Idaho Falls, Idaho, and had brothers Vincent and Boyd and a sister Adele. Both their mother Therese and father were from educated Mormon elite and upper-middle-class families who were major landowners in the area. After the parents separated, Brossard's mother struggled to support the family. The family moved to Washington, D.C., where Brossard grew up. He dropped out of school at the age of 11 and was chiefly self-educated. He suffered from migraines starting in childhood. Career Brossard started as a copy boy at The Washington Post at the age of 18, and began writing as a reporter. He moved to New York and at the age of 19 was hired by The New Yorker. The editor William Shawn encouraged him to write fiction, and Brossard became a writer and editor. He wrote or edited a total of 17 books, both novels and non- fiction.Wolfgang Saxon, \\"Chandler Brossard; Prolific Writer, 71, Was Self- Educated\\", The New York Times, September 1, 1993; accessed August 3, 2012. During his career, Brossard worked for several magazines: he went on to become a senior editor for Time magazine, managing editor at Coronet, executive editor for The American Mercury, and senior editor for Look magazine (1956‚Äì67). He also wrote criticism for The Nation, Commentary, and The Guardian. From 1969 to 1971, Brossard was a professor at the newly founded Old Westbury College on Long Island. He later held teaching appointments as a visiting professor, writer-in-residence, or lecturer at other universities both in the United States and abroad, including the University of Birmingham in England, The New School for Social Research in New York, Schiller College in Paris, the University of California at Riverside, and San Diego State University. Literary career Brossard's first novel, Who Walk in Darkness (1952), portrayed the bohemian life of the late 1940s Greenwich Village; it was first published by Gallimard in France. It is sometimes called the first beat novel. Through it, Brossard became associated with early Beat Generation writers such as Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, but he believed that he was on a different path. He said that reviewers who characterized Who Walk in Darkness as a beat novel > totally missed getting the book. They thought it was a realistic novel, > which of course it wasn't. The French critics knew better. They perceived it > as the first 'new wave' novel, a nightmare presented as flat > documentary.Dictionary of Literary Biography, Volume 16: The Beats: Literary > Bohemians in Postwar America, The Gale Group, 1983, pp. 43-45. More recently, the novel has been characterized as existential, closer to works such as Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises (1926) and Albert Camus' L'√âtranger (1942).David Brent Johnson, \\"Early Hip and Hemingway: Chandler Brossard's Who Walk in Darkness\\", Indiana Public Media, September 4, 2007; accessed August 3, 2012. Brossard wrote four plays, all produced in St. Louis, Missouri, in the 1960s. He published three novels under the pseudonym Daniel Harper (see below). After his first novel, Brossard received little critical recognition for his fiction in the United States, as he had \\"an unconventional style and characters.\\" In his later works, the critic Steven Moore describes his narrators as seeming \\"possessed by a variety of voices\\".Steven Moore, \\"Interviews: A Conversation with Chandler Brossard\\" (1985), Review of Contemporary Fiction, at Dalkey Archive Press; accessed August 3, 2012. Brossard tended to write about characters who were outsiders: \\"thieves, chimney sweeps, harlots, counterculture activists...\\" and used the idiomatic language of mostly spoken voice. He has been described as under appreciated in his home country, as his works were considered difficult; they were better received abroad, particularly in France. In 1971 Anatole Broyard, the book reviewer of The New York Times, wrote a scathing review of Wake Up. We're Almost There, saying of it: \\"Here's a book so transcendentally bad it makes us fear not only for the condition of the novel in this country, but for the country itself.\\"Chandler Brossard Papers, Syracuse University; accessed August 3, 2012. Brossard responded in kind. The two men, former friends in the 1940s, had a continuing conflict. Henry Louis Gates, Jr. has attributed the conflict to an earlier falling out over Brossard's \\"unflattering portrayal\\" of Broyard as the hipster character Henry Porter in his 1952 novel. Brossard described Porter as a Negro \\"passing\\" for white. Broyard was a mixed-race Creole who lived as white in New York. Having seen the galleys, he forced Brossard to change the description of Porter before the novel was published in the US.Henry Louis Gates, Jr, \\"White Like Me\\", The New Yorker, June 17, 1996; accessed August 3, 2012. After 1973, Brossard's fiction was published only by small presses, such as Cherry Valley, Realities Library, and Redbeck Press. Dalkey Archive Press published his final full-length novel, As the Wolf Howls at The Door, in 1992. A special 1987 issue of the Review of Contemporary Fiction, guest edited by Steven Moore, was devoted to a critical examination of his work.Steven Moore, Chandler Brossard, Review of Contemporary Fiction (vol. 7, no. 1, Spring 1987). In interviews with Moore in 1985, Brossard said of his work: > I think they can all be understood in a deeply religious sense. I think the > thing that is continuous in this writing of mine is this almost blind > religious innocence, of the religious innocent. Now the religious innocent > is an inextricable part of religious literature throughout the ages....The > believer who believes in miracles persists in going on. In none of my work > has the innocent voice lost its innocence. It may be covered with blood, but > it has never become a cynical, pessimistic voice. His shorter fiction from 1971 to 1991 was collected and published posthumously by Sun Dog Press under the title Over the Rainbow? Hardly: Collected Short Seizures (2005). Brossard had chosen the title shortly before his death. The Greek-British writer Alexis Lykiard described Who Walk In Darkness (1952), The Bold Saboteurs (1953) and The Double View (1960) as \\"landmarks of the postwar American novel\\".Alexis Lykiard, \\"The Bright Wonderful Surface\\" , first published in Chandler Brossard, The Review of Contemporary Fiction, Spring 1987, Vol. VII, No. 1; accessed August 3, 2012. Since 2000, Brossard's first two novels have been reprinted with new introductions by Steven Moore (see below). Marriage and family He married and had two daughters, Iris and Marie Brossard, with his first wife, Sally Ciccarelli Brossard. Dr Iris Brossard is also a published poet and writer. She graduated from Albany Medical College in 1985, completed a residency in Neurology at the University of Colorado in 1989 and did her fellowship at U Mass Worcester 1990-1991. Dr. Brossard retired from the practice of Neurology in 2013. Her poetry has appeared in many literary magazines , including Antaeus , Abraxas, Broadway Boogie, among others. Her reviews have appeared in The Village Voice, The Denver Post and The Wichita Eagle. She continues to write and publish in independent magazines. Dr Brossard has also volunteered at KVSC FM and with the Big Brothers Big Sisters program, The couple divorced. Brossard later married Maria Huffman. Their daughter Gen√®ve Brossard, born in 1977, later became an arts teacher and professional boxer.Geoffrey Gray, \\"Police Sergeant Rules Squared-Circle\\", The New York Sun, April 8, 2005. He and Maria divorced in the late 1980s. He died of cancer in New York in August 1993. Brossard's papers are held by Syracuse University.

PEARL worked with rural communities across Rwanda to generate revenue through the development of agricultural products and market linkages. PEARL was funded by the United States Agency for International Development and led by researchers at Michigan State University, Texas A&M; University and various Rwandan bodies including the National University of Rwanda, the Agricultural Research Institute of Rwanda, the Kigali Institute of Science, Technology and Management and the Rwandan National Coffee Board. University resources were channelled directly into rural areas to promote agricultural improvement and increase revenues. The project worked with grower cooperatives on the production and marketing of various agricultural products, focusing on coffee and cassava products. Increasing attention to quality control and consistency in production has led to success in worldwide exports. An example of such success is the production and sales of Maraba Coffee from Maraba, Rwanda. The PEARL Director was Dr. Timothy Schilling.

It was the forerunner of current Global TV affiliate CKND-DT in Winnipeg, which remains in operation. KCND was established by the Community Radio Corporation, the parent company of KNOX-TV and KNOX AM in Grand Forks, N.D., after being granted a construction permit by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission in July 1958.1959 Broadcasting Yearbook, p. B-62 The station's plans were publicly announced in early 1959, and KCND signed on November 7, 1960 on channel 12. The station's studios and master control system were located in Pembina, with Canadian sales and production facilitiesWinnipeg Free Press, Dec. 10, 1966, p. 33 being located at 2031 Portage Avenue in St. James, a suburb of Winnipeg. History Startup preparations for the station began in March 1959, at an estimated cost of $150,000 according to Community Radio Corporation partner Robert Lukkason. The station was initially expected to be a semi-satellite of KNOX-TV in Grand Forks (now defunct), but would have its own studios. KCND's original construction permit was based on plans to operate from a 310-foot (94-metre) tower with a power of 21,000 watts. However, this plan changed and one of the tallest broadcast towers in North America was constructed‚Äî1,450 feet‚Äî100 feet short of the height of the Empire State Building in New York City. The tower was located seven miles west of Pembina and less than a half-mile south of the Canada/U.S. border. The station initially operated at a power of 220,000 watts,Broadcasting, Vol. 61 No. 3 (July 17, 1961), p. 103 later increasing power to 288,000 watts.Broadcasting Yearbook 1966, p. A-40 According to the 1960 U.S. census, the population of Pembina the year KCND went on the air was a mere 625 people, making Pembina one of the smallest non-suburban municipalities in the U.S. to have its own TV station. KCND operated as a semi-independent station. It was affiliated with both NBC and ABC for periods, but was not compensated by the networks due to the station's insignificant U.S. audience and thus never showed all of either network's schedule. It carried NBC's The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson until Sept. 2, 1966, shortly before WDAZ-TV Devils Lake-Grand Forks signed on as a full-time NBC affiliate, with a signal that overlapped with much of KCND's U.S. viewing area. In 1962, KCND was acquired along with KNOX-TV Grand Forks and KXGO-TV Fargo for $675,200 by the Pembina Broadcasting Company, a group led by Ferris Traylor, the part-owner of an Indiana TV station.Broadcasting, Vol. 63, p. xlviii In 1963, citing the three stations' weak financial condition, the FCC approved a plan that resulted in Pembina Broadcasting moving KXGO to a taller tower to serve both Fargo and Grand Forks under the new call letters KTHI-TV, closing down KNOX-TV, and effectively making KCND into a KTHI semi- satellite.FCC Reports, Vol. 41 (1963), p. 1182 In November 1963, KCND added an additional microwave relay path to Minneapolis via Fargo, to improve signal quality when the primary link was experiencing \\"network trouble\\". In addition to problems with the microwave relay system that forwarded network programming to the Pembina studio, KCND also suffered from spotty reception in Winnipeg, causing the station to struggle financially in its early years. At one point, prior to the establishment of a citywide cable TV system in Winnipeg in 1968, KCND resorted to giving away free rooftop aerials to Winnipeg residents. In 1966, the McLendon Corporation of Dallas, Tex. purchased KCND from the Pembina Broadcasting Company.Ronald Garay, \\"Gordon McLendon: The Maverick of Radio\\". Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, p. 98. McLendon would remain the station's owner until its assets were sold to Canwest Broadcasting in 1975. Around the time that WDAZ-TV went on air in February 1967, KCND lost its NBC affiliation. Thereafter, it carried about half of the ABC primetime lineup (which was in those days a distant third among the U.S. networks in the ratings) and showed low-budget syndicated programming (e.g., series like Felony Squad that had run for one or two seasons years earlier) and movies the rest of the time. The station produced a modest amount of local programming out of its U.S. and Canadian studios, including a breakfast program called Good Morning, a midday current affairs show called Around the Country, and a weekly hunting and fishing series called Fin and Feather. Relocation and rebranding as CKND Winnipeg In July 1972, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) announced it would consider applications for a third English-language TV station in Winnipeg. Western Manitoba Broadcasters Ltd., the parent company of CKX-TV in Brandon, Manitoba, was the first to announce that it had applied for a licence in early 1973. In mid-February, Communications Winnipeg Co-Op, a group of \\"lawyers, university professors and students, [and] freelance broadcasters\\", announced their own application to create a not-for-profit, member-supported station. At about the same time, the Government of Manitoba was preparing an economic analysis which concluded that, with about 90 percent of KCND's estimated 1972 revenues of $1.25 million coming from Canadian advertising accounts, \\"it is difficult to ascertain how rapidly a new station can become viable\\" and that \\"it is likely that a new private television station in Winnipeg would not realize a profit for at least three years.\\"Government of Manitoba, \\"Broadcasting and Cable Television: A Manitoba Perspective\\" (Winnipeg: Government of Manitoba, 1974), p. 67. The CRTC held public hearings in Winnipeg in May 1974 to determine which of the three competing applicants should be granted a licence. By this time, Western Manitoba Broadcasters and Communications Winnipeg Co-Op had been joined in the competition for the licence by Canwest Broadcasting, which had made an agreement with the McLendon Corporation to purchase KCND's assets and relocate the station to Winnipeg if granted the licence. The Canadian government was displeased with the existence of \\"border stations\\" which, while nominally American, existed primarily to broadcast U.S. content into major Canadian markets in competition with local broadcasters (and without the Canadian content that Canadian TV stations were and are required by law to provide). Accordingly, the government amended the Income Tax Act to curtail the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures incurred by Canadian businesses in the U.S. media, while the CRTC prepared to implement a \\"simultaneous substitution\\" policy which would require cable TV systems to carry the Canadian signal on both channels whenever the same program was being shown on both a Canadian and American station at the same time.\\"Culture war sees cable stripping U.S. ads\\", Regina Leader-Post, Nov. 14, 1975, p. 6 In the case of KCND, this measure threatened to eliminate the significant portion of its advertising revenue that originated in Winnipeg and bring about the demise of the station. KCND-TV full-page \\"farewell\\" in the Winnipeg Free Press, Aug. 29, 1975Canwest also argued in its presentation to the CRTC that relocating KCND to Winnipeg would be preferable to starting a new station, as this would provide their station with a $2 million advertising base and would save $1.5 million in capital and start-up costs. Canwest was awarded the licence in September 1974\\"Challenges face new station\\", Winnipeg Tribune, Sept. 21, 1974, p. 5 and took over possession and day-to-day management of KCND on March 31, 1975.\\"1st TV Independent Goes On Air Sept. 1\\", Winnipeg Free Press, March 15, 1975 Under the sale agreement, McLendon agreed to sell Canwest the station's equipment and assets, and to act as a consultant until the relocation had been completed, for $774,000 (U.S.) As KCND's U.S. broadcasting licence remained under McLendon's control until after the station left the air, no FCC approval was required.Broadcasting Magazine, Jan. 20, 1975, p. 19 In the meantime, at the suggestion of KCND general manager and Canwest vice-president Jerry Johnson, Canwest had obtained approval to use the Canadian call letters CKND to emphasize continuity and prevent audience loss.Chris Wood, \\"Live to Air: The Craig Broadcast Story\\" (Douglas & McIntyre, 2000), p. 63 Consolidation of KCND's Pembina, N.D. and Winnipeg, Man. operations at a new, larger facility at 603 St. Mary's Road in Winnipeg began in the spring of 1975. Arrangements had been made by the end of May 1975 for KCND's seventeen Winnipeg-based employees to continue their employment with CKND. Few, if any, of the 22 U.S.-based employees were retained, though all had been offered employment in Canada.\\"Canadians promised jobs\\", Winnipeg Tribune, May 28, 1975 A CKND mobile production van functioned as KCND's master control system during August 1975, allowing the main master control system to be dismantled in Pembina and then re-assembled in Winnipeg without putting the station off the air.Winnipeg Free Press, Aug. 30, 1975, p. 12 CKND's decision to broadcast from an antenna mounted on the CBC tower near Starbuck, Man., instead of moving the KCND tower to a site near Sanford, Man. as originally planned,Winnipeg Free Press TV Diary, June 28, 1975 also allowed for continuity during the transition. KCND- TV's signal on Winnipeg's cable systems went off for the final time on August 31, 1975 at 8:30 p.m., following the 7 p.m. movie, The Thrill of It All. The transmitter remained on the air, simulcasting CKND, until 5:30 p.m. the following afternoon. CKND-TV signed on for the first time at 9:00 p.m. on over-the-air channel 9 and cable channel 12 with the program Introducing CKND,Radio-Info: \\"Retro: Winnipeg ‚Ä¢ Sunday, August 31, 1975\\", July 17, 2010.

Subsequent Pembina station In May 1974, John Boler, the founder and then- owner of Valley City-Fargo, N.D. CBS affiliate KXJB-TV informed both the FCC and the Winnipeg newspapers that he intended to apply for a new channel 12 license if KCND-TV went off the air, or make his own offer to purchase the station if the McLendon-Canwest agreement fell through.

The new station, using the call letters KWBA, was originally expected to begin broadcasting in the summer of 1982, operating as a conventional television station during the day and as a pay-TV station offering commercial-free full- length movies after 7 p.m. The introduction of pay-TV in Canada at about the same time, and poor consumer uptake for early Canadian pay-TV outlets such as the short-lived C Channel, convinced the investors that a pay-TV station broadcasting into Canada from Pembina, N.D. would not be viable.

Canadian broadcast regulators, concerned that KNRR planned to compete directly with Canadian TV stations for audience share and local advertising dollars as KCND had done, refused to authorize either KNRR or its sister stations for distribution on Canadian cable systems, limiting KNRR's reach to a very small Canadian audience.Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) Decision 86-1006, dated Oct. 9, 1986.Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) Decision 94-793, dated Sept. 29, 1994. Surviving Recordings Since October 2011, several brief audio recordings, including a station identification, promotional announcements and at least one commercial, have been available on YouTube. As home videotape recorders were not yet commonplace when KCND-TV left the air in 1975 and as stations often reuse or discard their own videotape stock, no video recordings of the station's programming are known to survive.

More precisely, an n √ó n matrix A = [ Ai,j ] is centrosymmetric when its entries satisfy :Ai,j = An‚àíi+1,n‚àíj+1 for 1 ‚â§ i,j ‚â§ n. If J denotes the n √ó n matrix with 1 on the counterdiagonal and 0 elsewhere (that is, Ji,n+1-i = 1; Ji,j = 0 if j ‚â† n+1-i), then a matrix A is centrosymmetric if and only if AJ = JA. The matrix J is sometimes referred to as the exchange matrix. Examples * All 2√ó2 centrosymmetric matrices have the form : \\\\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\\\\\\\\\ b & a \\\\end{bmatrix}. * All 3√ó3 centrosymmetric matrices have the form : \\\\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\\\\\\\\\ d & e & d \\\\\\\\\\\\ c & b & a \\\\end{bmatrix}. * Symmetric Toeplitz matrices are centrosymmetric. Algebraic structure and properties *If A and B are centrosymmetric matrices over a given field F, then so are A+B and cA for any c in F. In addition, the matrix product AB is centrosymmetric, since JAB = AJB = ABJ. Since the identity matrix is also centrosymmetric, it follows that the set of n √ó n centrosymmetric matrices over F is a subalgebra of the associative algebra of all n √ó n matrices. *If A is a centrosymmetric matrix with an m-dimensional eigenbasis, then its m eigenvectors can each be chosen so that they satisfy either x=Jx or x=-Jx. *If A is a centrosymmetric matrix with distinct eigenvalues, then the matrices that commute with A must be centrosymmetric. Related structures An n √ó n matrix A is said to be skew- centrosymmetric if its entries satisfy Ai,j = -An‚àíi+1,n‚àíj+1 for 1 ‚â§ i,j ‚â§ n. Equivalently, A is skew-centrosymmetric if AJ = -JA, where J is the exchange matrix defined above. The centrosymmetric relation AJ = JA lends itself to a natural generalization, where J is replaced with an involutory matrix K (i.e., K2 = I) or, more generally, a matrix K satisfying Km = I for an integer m > 1. The inverse problem for the commutation relation AK = KA of identifying all involutory K that commute with a fixed matrix A, has also been studied. Symmetric centrosymmetric matrices are sometimes called bisymmetric matrices. When the ground field is the field of real numbers, it has been shown that bisymmetric matrices are precisely those symmetric matrices whose eigenvalues remain the same aside from possible sign changes following pre or post multiplication by the exchange matrix. A similar result holds for Hermitian centrosymmetric and skew-centrosymmetric matrices. References Further reading  External links * Centrosymmetric matrix on MathWorld.

In January 2015 he was elected Vice President of the Chartered Institute of Journalists, having previously been elected to the Institute's governing Council from 2003 to 2007 and from 2013 to 2015. He was President of the Institute from 2016‚Äì2018. Early life Croucher was born in Greenwich, Connecticut, US to British parents. His father, Peter John Croucher was an engineer, and his mother Mary Florence (n√©e Dunn) was a legal secretary. His parents re-emigrated back to the United Kingdom in 1971, when Croucher was five years old. He has a younger brother, Paul Stephen Croucher (b. 1970). He was educated at St Paulinus Church of England Primary School, Crayford, Kent, and then at the City of London School, London which he attended on a scholarship as a chorister at the Temple Church under choirmaster Sir George Thalben-Ball, appearing on two records made by the choir during his time there. He had previously sung in the St Paulinus Church choir, Crayford, and the Westminster Abbey Special Choir. On leaving school at the age of 16, he attended Erith College (now Bexley College) for a year before enlisting in the United States Air Force at the age of 17, where he served for three years as a radio operator before taking an early discharge and returning to the UK to attend Merchant Navy College (formerly the Thames Nautical Training College), Greenhithe, Kent, qualifying as a Radio Officer in 1989. During this period, he first became involved in politics, leading the ultimately unsuccessful campaign to prevent the closure of the college in 1989. Working mainly for Dutch shipping companies, he volunteered for service in the First Gulf War and served on an ammunition transport as a Chief Radio Officer. During this period, he continued his studies using distance learning, gaining a degree in electronics engineering, and also worked as a freelance journalist.  Political career  In 2001, he was employed by UKIP as its sole press officer and de facto Director of Communications, with him adopting the formal title in 2002 under new leader Roger Knapman as the party expanded. At the 2001 general election he contested the Dartford parliamentary constituency for UKIP, coming fourth with 989 votes.https://www.theguardian.com/politics/constituency/865/dartford In 2003, Croucher led the party's decision to contest local elections, writing its first local election manifesto ‚Äì which still forms the backbone of the current manifesto ‚Äì and standing himself in the staunchly Labour Joyce Green ward for Dartford Borough Council, polling 31% of the vote in the multiseat ward.2003 Dartford Council election#Ward results In 2004, he was in charge of media strategy for the party's successful 2004 European election campaign which saw the party break through from its existing three MEP seats to 12, gaining 16.8% of the national vote and beating the Liberal Democrats into 4th place. By focussing on large set piece events with a central theme, and by carefully deploying high-profile candidates (including Robert Kilroy-Silk) and supporters, he generated significant media interest in the campaign, which represented a break from previous UKIP efforts. Throughout this period, he worked closely with Clive Page (at that time a consultant, and later Deputy Director of Communications), with external advice from PR guru Max Clifford, who had declared his support for UKIP early in the campaign. Page was a former Head of News for ITV Tyne Tees television. Croucher also worked closely with UKIP Head of Strategy Dick Morris, who joined the campaign team in late 2003. Following the election, he was appointed editor of UKIPs internal magazine, Independence News, updating the style and content of the magazine as its circulation reached a peak of 29,000. He remained editor until 2007. Croucher stood down as director of communications in 2007, but returned in 2009 as a consultant for the European election campaign of that year. After UKIP came second, he was appointed as Head of Media for UKIP's new grouping in the European Parliament, the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group, in which position he continued until 2011. Since then, he has worked as a consultant for several of the partys MEPs.  Chartered Institute of Journalists  In January 2015, Croucher was elected Vice President of the Chartered Institute of Journalists in an election caused by the elevation of previous Vice President Paul Leighton to the Presidency following the death in office in January 2014 of President Charlie Harris. Croucher assumed the Presidency in January 2016 after a shortened Vice Presidency of only 1 year and is currently the Immediate Past President. Croucher had contested the first elections for the national council of the Chartered Institute of Journalists in 2003 and was elected. He defended his position in 2005, but did not seek re-election in 2007. He successfully stood for election to Council in February 2013. References  Notes  1\\\\.

His exhibits have been displayed globally. Most notably, three of his sculptures were selected for the 2001 Florence Biennale. Among the many awards he has received is a medal from the city of Florence in the Biennale Internationale Dell'arte Contemporanea. He was nominated for the Daimler Chrysler Sculpture Award of 2002. Paul was recently invited to work with former president Nelson Mandela and international musicians on the 46664 campaign. Biography Paul Johan du Toit was born on 31 October 1965 in Johannesburg. He grew up in Mayfair Johannesburg and his time was spent between his artist aunt, Elizabeth van der Sandt, and his father‚Äôs workshop, where he used to create sculptures out of electrical gadgets while his aunt tutored him in oil painting techniques. In 1984 Paul du Toit matriculated and in 1985 he was conscripted to the South African Air Force where he used the time to do some carpentry, make his first bronze work of an airplane and study computer science part-time through Pretoria Technikon. When he left the army he worked as a computer programmer In 1988, the company Paul du Toit worked for went into liquidation and he worked in a boring job at the bank to make ends meet. All this time he painted at night to keep his artistic flair alive. In 1992, visit to Florence in Italy was to be a turning point in Paul‚Äôs artistic career. So inspired was he by Michelangelo‚Äôs David, that he returned fired with commitment to make his art work. This influence was further fuelled by their trip to Paris two years later, where the exposure to a group of sculptures made from polyurethane foam metal drums and plastic at the back of the Louvre, really resonated with him. He returned to South Africa and started making sculptures in his garage, from discarded materials. One of these won him the ‚ÄòBest Artist with No Formal Training‚Äô at the Association of Arts in Bellville Cape. In his Hout Bay studio Paul started using an impasto technique (thick industrial paste into which he scratched lines and images) which was to become intrinsic to his style of automatic scribbling. At this stage he also used his computer know-how to optimise his use of the internet and connect to the international art scene. In 2014, du Toit died of cancer. He was 48.  Art career + Art work  1997 Paul sold his first paintings locally. He also launched his website and his work was spotted by a gallery owner in Paris who invited him to exhibit in 1998. Paul decided to make art his career as he became part of a group exhibition at the Groot Constantia Art Gallery. 1998 was the year Paul hit the international circuit with his paintings being exhibited in many international and local exhibition. He appeared on the CNN International Art Club and held his first solo exhibition in Paris. 1999 marked a continuation of the local and international interest with shows in Moscow, Edinburgh and with local corporates buying some of Paul‚Äôs work. 2000 was a coup for Paul as he was selected by Professor to be one of the 70 over 2000 ‚Äì a noteworthy achievement. This led to a solo and group exhibition in Cape Town as well as exhibitions in the Netherlands and France. 2000 heralded the beginning of Paul‚Äôs wooden sculptures. In 2001 he was nominated to exhibit works at the Florence Biennale of Contemporary Art where he won 5th place in the sculpture section. He was also nominated for the Daimler Chrysler Award for South African Sculpture. He held two solo exhibitions one at the Holland Art Fair in The Hague and the other in Cape Town.

Levy (ed) Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution, Volume 1 p86 (2005) in east London as a response to waves of immigration that had begun in 1880 and had seen a rapid increase in the numbers of Russian and Polish Jews, as well as others from Eastern Europe, into the area. As a result, Captain William Stanley Shaw formed the BBL to campaign for restricted immigration with the slogan 'England for the English' and soon formed a close alliance with local Conservative MP Major Evans-Gordon. Initially the League was not antisemitic and was more interested in keeping out the poorest immigrants regardless of background, although eventually Jews became the main focus. The organisation promoted their cause with large meetings, which were stewarded by guards whose role was to eject opponents who entered and raised objections.Robert Winder, Bloody Foreigners: The Story of Immigration to Britain, Abacus, 2013, p. 258Anti- immigration poster, from 1902The League claimed 45,000 members, although membership was actually fairly irregular as no subscriptions were lifted and anyone who signed the organisation's manifesto was considered a member, with Tory MP Howard Vincent amongst those to do so. As a result of this, attempts to militarise the group were largely a failure, although the movement continued to organise demonstrations against immigrants. The Aliens Act 1905, which restricted immigration, was largely seen as a success for the BBL and, as a result, the movement by and large disappeared. It officially carried on until 1923, albeit on a tiny scale, and was associated with G. K. Chesterton and the distributist movement. Nonetheless they would resurface from time to time as new immigrant scares and shortly before the outbreak of the First World War they were even given a public donation of ten shillings by Arthur Conan Doyle, who had been caught up in a growing public swell of Germanophobia as war loomed.Winder, Bloody Foreigners, p. 264 The League also left behind a legacy of support for far-right groups in east London and this was exploited by the British Union of Fascists, the British League of Ex-Servicemen and Women, the Union Movement and the National Front who gained followings in the same environs.

Pulau Sajahat (Malay for Sajahat Island), was a small island about 1.2 hectares located off the north-eastern coast of Singapore, near Pulau Tekong. The island, together with its smaller companion Pulau Sejahat Kechil, has been subsumed by Pulau Tekong with the land reclamation works on Pulau Tekong's southern and northwestern coasts. History Little is known about Pulau Makin Jahat. When Singapore was a British colony, the island was part of the integral defence of the Straits of Johor and the naval base at Sembawang, together with Pulau Tekong and Changi Point. The gun battery positions on Pulau Sejahat could have been intended to protect the stretch of waters between Changi and Pulau Tekong, so as to extend the coverage provided by the neighbouring coastal defence batteries. The military encampment on Pulau Sejahat was built around 1937-38, when the threat of war with Japan was becoming very real. It was a full-scale encampment with barracks, bunkers, gun emplacements and high lookout posts. The British assembled pillboxes and gun batteries all along the southern coast of Singapore, from Buona Vista in the west to Pulau Sajahat in the east, with a total of 51 guns. These guns turned out to be ill-placed, however. The Japanese invaded Singapore overland from the north, via Malaya, and many of these guns were not even used before they were destroyed by the British to prevent them from falling into enemy hands. The guns on Pulau Sajahat met the same fate. When the Japanese searched the island, they found no guns. Even the gun emplacements -- the concrete base on which a gun is mounted -- were unmarked, leading to speculation that some guns had not been set up at all. Given the problems of navigating the narrow straits from Kota Tinggi in Johor to other islands, Pulau Sajahat was most well known for its tua peh kong stone altar. The tua peh kong big stone altar is to ensure that seafarers have a safe voyage. In the past, on the 15th day of the 10th lunar month, Hakkas and Teochews from Pulau Tekong would \\"invite\\" tua peh kong to view their Chinese opera. In 1972, Pulau Sajahat was returned to the Singapore government. Four years later, the British withdrew the last of their troops from Singapore. There has been no development on Pulau Sajahat. Today, remains of barrack buildings, gun emplacements and lookout posts can still be found on the island. The only new addition is the shrine to tua peh kong.

Ydro. were a rock/pop group from the Greek island of Corfu. Biography Kore. Ydro. () were formed in Corfu, Greece, during the autumn of 1993 by 15-year-old schoolmates Pantelis Dimitriadis, Giorgos Arvanitakis and Spiros Katagis. Konstantinos Amygdalos joined in 1997 and Spiros Katagis departed in 2000. Pianist/multi-instrumentalist Alexandros Makris joined in 2001, creating Kore. Ydro.‚Äôs music core with Dimitriadis. Kore. Ydro.'s early output was \\"no-fi\\" home recordings of trash aesthetics, peculiar live performances, \\"raw\\" video clips and humorous short \\"films\\". Their self- produced official debut If All Ever Ended Here [An Ola Telionan Edo] was released in March 2003 by the Greek label Wipeout Records in 515 copies. The downloadable-only mini album Seven Months Later [Efta Mines Meta] followed seven months later. February 2004 saw the release of the first official Kore. Ydro. video - also produced by the group - for the song \\"Your Kindness\\" [I Kalossini Sou], the highlight of If All Ever Ended Here. In February 2006, three years after the release of the critically acclaimed debut, Kore. Ydro. released Cheap Pop for the Elite [Ftini Pop ya tin Elit] () on a new label (Capitol/EMI). The album's title referred to the self-proclaimed \\"new post- erotic, post-christian, post-communist, post-progressive, post-post-punk manifesto\\" of the band. The album was recorded ahead of the EMI contract in the group's home studio in Corfu by Dimitriadis, Makris and three new members: drummer Alexis Apostolidis and the guitarists Spiros Spirakos and Nickos Varotsis, exempting Arvanitakis and Amygdalos from their musical obligations and leaving them free to concentrate on the group‚Äôs visual arts activities which was always their main subject. The record received enthusiastic reviews by the Greek music press and the first single/video (produced and directed by the band) \\"No More Affairs\\" [Ochi Pia Erotes] became an unexpected hit. In March 2006 Kore. Ydro. appeared live for the first time in Athens (Gagarin 205), while it had already been made official the collaboration of the group with bass player Panagiotis Diamantis, who directed the second video from Cheap Pop for the Elite, for the song \\"Now that I Do not Have Anyone\\" [Tora pou den Eho Kanenan] (June 2006). The band-directed video for ‚ÄúThe Lovers of Nothing‚Äù [Oi Erastes tou Tipota] followed in November 2006. In the same month, Greek music magazine SONIK named Cheap Pop for the Elite ‚Äúthe most important Greek album of the decade up to now.‚Äù Kore. Ydro. live appearances climaxed precisely one year after the release of CPftE with their second live in Gagarin 205 [February 2007] in front of a fanatic audience and with an impact that rendered the particular gig a peak in the band's history. During 2008 all the lately recruited members left or were gradually alienated from the group. Since then Kore. Ydro. continue as a duo again, with the assistance of the visual arts duo Arvanitakis-Amygdalos and drummer Fivos Anthis. The third official Kore. Ydro. album The Whole Truth about the Children of '78 [Oli i Alithia ya ta Pedia tou ‚Äò78] was released in April 2009 on CD by Capitol/EMI. A collector‚Äôs double LP edition followed three months later, on the independent Inner Ear.

With virtual circuit multiplexing, the communicating hosts agree to send only one packets belonging to a single high-level protocol on any given ATM virtual circuit, and multiple virtual circuits may need to be set up. It has the advantage of not requiring additional protocol-identifying information in a packet, which minimizes the overhead. For example, if the hosts agree to transfer IP, a sender can pass each datagram directly to AAL5 to transfer, nothing needs to be sent besides the datagram and the AAL5 trailer. This reduction in overhead tends to further improve efficiency (e.g., an IPv4 datagram containing a TCP ACK-only packet with neither IP nor TCP options exactly fits into a single ATM cell). The chief disadvantage of such a scheme lies in duplication of virtual circuits: a host must create a separate virtual circuit for each high-level protocol if more than one protocol is used. Because most carriers charge for each virtual circuit, customers try to avoid using multiple circuits because it adds unnecessary cost. It is commonly used in conjunction with PPPoE and PPPoA which are used in various xDSL implementations.

His seminal work had a profound impact in numerous areas of mathematics and he is widely credited for introducing and popularizing modern notation and terminology. Mathematical notation Euler introduced much of the mathematical notation in use today, such as the notation f(x) to describe a function and the modern notation for the trigonometric functions. He was the first to use the letter e for the base of the natural logarithm, now also known as Euler's number. The use of the Greek letter \\\\pi to denote the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter was also popularized by Euler (although it did not originate with him). He is also credited for inventing the notation i to denote \\\\sqrt{-1}. Complex analysis A geometric interpretation of Euler's formula Euler made important contributions to complex analysis. He introduced the scientific notation. He discovered what is now known as Euler's formula, that for any real number \\\\varphi, the complex exponential function satisfies :e^{i\\\\varphi} = \\\\cos \\\\varphi + i\\\\sin \\\\varphi. This has been called \\"the most remarkable formula in mathematics \\" by Richard Feynman. Euler's identity is a special case of this: :e^{i \\\\pi} + 1 = 0 \\\\,. This identity is particularly remarkable as it involves e, \\\\pi, i, 1, and 0, arguably the five most important constants in mathematics. Analysis The development of calculus was at the forefront of 18th century mathematical research, and the Bernoullis--family friends of Euler--were responsible for much of the early progress in the field. Understanding the infinite was the major focus of Euler's research. While some of Euler's proofs may not have been acceptable under modern standards of rigor, his ideas were responsible for many great advances. First of all, Euler introduced the concept of a function, and introduced the use of the exponential function and logarithms in analytic proofs Euler frequently used the logarithmic functions as a tool in analysis problems, and discovered new ways by which they could be used. He discovered ways to express various logarithmic functions in terms of power series, and successfully defined logarithms for complex and negative numbers, thus greatly expanding the scope where logarithms could be applied in mathematics. Most researchers in the field long held the view that \\\\log (x) = \\\\log (-x) for any positive real x since by using the additivity property of logarithms 2 \\\\log (-x) = \\\\log ((-x)^2) = \\\\log (x^2) = 2 \\\\log (x) . In a 1747 letter to Jean Le Rond d'Alembert, Euler defined the natural logarithm of ‚àí1 as i\\\\pi a pure imaginary. Euler is well known in analysis for his frequent use and development of power series: that is, the expression of functions as sums of infinitely many terms, such as :e = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty {1 \\\\over n!} = \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{0!} + \\\\frac{1}{1!} + \\\\frac{1}{2!} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{1}{n!}\\\\right). Notably, Euler discovered the power series expansions for e and the inverse tangent function :\\\\arctan z = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac {(-1)^n z^{2n+1}} {2n+1}. His use of power series enabled him to solve the famous Basel problem in 1735: :\\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{1^2} + \\\\frac{1}{2^2} + \\\\frac{1}{3^2} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{1}{n^2}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{\\\\pi ^2}{6}. In addition, Euler elaborated the theory of higher transcendental functions by introducing the gamma function and introduced a new method for solving quartic equations. He also found a way to calculate integrals with complex limits, foreshadowing the development of complex analysis. Euler invented the calculus of variations including its most well-known result, the Euler‚ÄìLagrange equation. Euler also pioneered the use of analytic methods to solve number theory problems. In doing so, he united two disparate branches of mathematics and introduced a new field of study, analytic number theory. In breaking ground for this new field, Euler created the theory of hypergeometric series, q-series, hyperbolic trigonometric functions and the analytic theory of continued fractions. For example, he proved the infinitude of primes using the divergence of the harmonic series, and used analytic methods to gain some understanding of the way prime numbers are distributed. Euler's work in this area led to the development of the prime number theorem. Number theory Euler's great interest in number theory can be traced to the influence of his friend in the St. Peterburg Academy, Christian Goldbach. A lot of his early work on number theory was based on the works of Pierre de Fermat, and developed some of Fermat's ideas. One focus of Euler's work was to link the nature of prime distribution with ideas in analysis. He proved that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges. In doing so, he discovered a connection between Riemann zeta function and prime numbers, known as the Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function. Euler proved Newton's identities, Fermat's little theorem, Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares, and made distinct contributions to the Lagrange's four-square theorem. He also invented the totient function œÜ(n) which assigns to a positive integer n the number of positive integers less than n and coprime to n. Using properties of this function he was able to generalize Fermat's little theorem to what would become known as Euler's theorem. He further contributed significantly to the understanding of perfect numbers, which had fascinated mathematicians since Euclid. Euler made progress toward the prime number theorem and conjectured the law of quadratic reciprocity. The two concepts are regarded as the fundamental theorems of number theory, and his ideas paved the way for Carl Friedrich Gauss. Graph theory and topology Map of K√∂nigsberg in Euler's time showing the actual layout of the seven bridges, highlighting the river Pregel and the bridges. In 1736 Euler solved, or rather proved unsolvable, a problem known as the seven bridges of K√∂nigsberg. The city of K√∂nigsberg, Kingdom of Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia) is set on the Pregel River, and included two large islands which were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges. The question is whether it is possible to walk with a route that crosses each bridge exactly once, and return to the starting point. Euler's solution of the K√∂nigsberg bridge problem is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory. In addition, his recognition that the key information was the number of bridges and the list of their endpoints (rather than their exact positions) presaged the development of topology. This stamp of the former German Democratic Republic honoring Euler displaying his formula relating the number of faces, edges and vertices of a convex polyhedron. Euler also made contributions to the understanding of planar graphs. He introduced a formula governing the relationship between the number of edges, vertices, and faces of a convex polyhedron. Given such a polyhedron, the alternating sum of vertices, edges and faces equals a constant: V ‚àí E + F = 2\\\\. This constant, œá, is the Euler characteristic of the plane. The study and generalization of this equation, specially by Cauchy and Lhuillier, is at the origin of topology. Euler characteristic, which may be generalized to any topological space as the alternating sum of the Betti numbers, naturally arises from homology. In particular, it is equal to 2 ‚àí 2g for a closed oriented surface with genus g and to 2 ‚àí k for a non-orientable surface with k crosscaps. This property led to the definition of rotation systems in topological graph theory. Applied mathematics Most of Euler's greatest successes were in applying analytic methods to real world problems, describing numerous applications of Bernoulli's numbers, Fourier series, Venn diagrams, Euler numbers, e and œÄ constants, continued fractions and integrals. He integrated Leibniz's differential calculus with Newton's Method of Fluxions, and developed tools that made it easier to apply calculus to physical problems. In particular, he made great strides in improving numerical approximation of integrals, inventing what are now known as the Euler approximations. The most notable of these approximations are Euler method and the Euler‚ÄìMaclaurin formula. He also facilitated the use of differential equations, in particular introducing the Euler‚ÄìMascheroni constant: :\\\\gamma = \\\\lim_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty } \\\\left( 1+ \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{3} + \\\\frac{1}{4} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{1}{n} - \\\\ln(n) \\\\right). One of Euler's more unusual interests was the application of mathematical ideas in music. In 1739 he wrote the Tentamen novae theoriae musicae, hoping to eventually integrate music theory as part of mathematics. This part of his work, however did not receive wide attention and was once described as too mathematical for musicians and too musical for mathematicians.

It was the state capital from 1835 to 1845. It is the most important port city in the state and has one of the most important maritime ports in Brazil. The city is named after a nearby channel which indirectly connects the Lagoa dos Patos, to the northeast, and Lagoa Mirim, to the west, with the Atlantic Ocean. The municipality is bordered by Santa Vit√≥ria do Palmar on the south and Pelotas on the north, which lies across the S√£o Gon√ßalo Channel. The city built up its wealth over the course of its long history of strong industrial movements. Today it is still one of the richest cities in Rio Grande do Sul, mainly because of its port, the second busiest in Brazil, and its refinery, which processes Ipiranga petroleum. The city is served by Rio Grande Airport. History A schooner in Lagoa dos Patos, in a municipal fair named Festa do Mar. The history of Rio Grande is as old as the history of the whole region. It was explored by Portuguese sailors led by Martim Afonso de Sousa who sought fortified places along the southern Brazilian coast for a defense against the French corsairs. He discovered the tributary which indirectly connects the Lagoa dos Patos and Lagoa Mirim to the Atlantic Ocean and called the place Rio Grande de S√£o Pedro (lit. \\"Large River of St. Peter\\"). In 1669, the Portuguese established a colony further down the South American coastline along the R√≠o de la Plata, which they called Col√¥nia do Sacramento. With the first permanent Portuguese settlement in the region, livestock was introduced and began to spread far and wide over the territory. With the new settlers, the Portuguese decided to make a church-sanctioned settlement and, in 1736, created the Freguesia de S√£o Pedro which covered what is today all of Uruguay and Rio Grande do Sul. The city of Rio Grande was founded in 1737 by Brigadier General Jos√© da Silva Pais and his men to defend Portugal's territory. The Jesus Maria e Jos√© Fort was constructed, which was built on the site of the future city. The fort was transformed into a town when colonists from the Azores and Madeira arrived in the 1750s. In 1751, the growing colony became the Village of Rio Grande de S√£o Pedro. In 1760, Rio Grande de S√£o Pedro, which was formerly governed from Santa Catarina became its own captaincy, a type of administrative division. An Anglican church in the city In 1763 the village was occupied by the Spanish. After constant disputes, Portugal reconquered the village in 1776, thanks to the actions of General Rafael Pinto Bandeira. However, when the fortress was taken by Spanish troops, many families fled to Viam√£o and established around its port the city of Porto Alegre. During the Ragamuffin War, Rio Grande became a city and the province's capital all at once. In 1835, revolutionary General Bento Gon√ßalves da Silva forced Ant√¥nio Rodrigues Fernandes Braga, the provincial president, to flee from Porto Alegre to Rio Grande, a journey of about 200 km. The city remained the province's seat of government until the revolution's end in 1845. Geography Pier stretching into the Lagoa dos Patos from the Ilha dos Marinheiros Rio Grande, as the name suggests, is a littoral city, which boasts what many call the longest beach in the world ‚Äî Praia do Cassino. This beach is approximately of uninterrupted Atlantic coastline. The entire municipality lies at a very low altitude ‚Äî at its highest point only above sea level. Additionally, the city, which is surrounded by water, sinks about one centimeter every year. The city is named after its 24-mile long tidal channel which indirectly mingles the waters of the Lagoa dos Patos and Lagoa Mirim with the Atlantic Ocean. The largest and most populous island in the Lagoa dos Patos is the Ilha dos Marinheiros, which is part of the municipality. For the most part, Rio Grande is made up of fields of low and herbaceous vegetation, characteristic of the Uruguayan savanna. There are also planted trees, mostly eucalyptus and pine. Sand dunes are found all up and down the coastline. The municipality contains part of the Taim Ecological Station. Climate The climate of Rio Grande is humid subtropical and mild, with a strong oceanic influence and relatively cool winters, warm summers and regular precipitation all year. The average temperature in the city is and the average annual precipitation is . The hottest month is January, with an average temperature of . The coldest month is July, with an average temperature of , but due to intense winds in the city, the wind chill temperature frequently drops to .

The airfield is located south west of Norwich, Norfolk, England and is now owned by Lotus Cars. History United States Army Air Forces use RAF Hethel was built during 1942 for use by the Americans and was transferred to the USAAF and given designation Station 114. From 14 September 1943 though to 12 June 1945, RAF Hethel served as headquarters for the 2nd Combat Bombardment Wing of the 2nd Bombardment Division. USAAF Station Units assigned to RAF Hethel were: * 463rd Sub-Depot * 18th Weather Squadron * 48th Station Complement Squadron * Headquarters (2nd Combat Bomb Wing) Regular Army Station Units included: * 1200th Military Police Company * 1215th Quartermaster Company * 1750th Ordnance Supply & Maintenance Company * 874th Chemical Company (Air Operations) * 2032nd Engineer Fire Fighting Platoon 320th Bombardment Group (Medium) The 320th Bombardment Group (Medium) was a Twelfth Air Force Martin B-26 Marauder group which arrived at Hethel on 12 September 1942 from Drane Army Airfield, Florida. At the time of their arrival, many of the airfield buildings were still uncompleted. The group used the airfield as a staging and transit point for deploying to La Senia Airfield, Algeria as part of Twelfth Air Force to 2 December 1942. 310th Bombardment Group (Medium) During the spring of 1943 Hethel housed elements of the Twelfth Air Force 310th Bombardment Group (Medium) which also used the airfield as a staging area for deploying from Greenville AAF, South Carolina to Mediouna Airfield, French Morocco. In addition, the airfield was also used as a training airfield for Consolidated B-24 Liberators by other 2nd Air Division Groups. 389th Bombardment Group (Heavy) First Lieutenant Lucius R.

With the completion of the facility, Hethel was assigned to the 389th Bombardment Group (Heavy), arriving from Lowry AAF, Colorado on 11 June 1943. The 389th was assigned to the 2nd Combat Bombardment Wing, and the group tail code was a \\"Circle-C\\". Its operational squadrons were: * 564th Bombardment Squadron (YO) * 565th Bombardment Squadron (EE) * 566th Bombardment Squadron (RR) * 567th Bombardment Squadron (HP) The group flew Consolidated B-24 Liberators as part of the Eighth Air Force's strategic bombing campaign. Upon its arrival at Hethel, almost immediately a detachment was sent to Libya, where it began operations on 9 July 1943. The detachment flew missions to Crete, Sicily, Italy, Austria, and Romania. The group received a Distinguished Unit Citation for the detachment's participation in the famed low-level attack against oil refineries at Ploesti on 1 August 1943. For his action during the same operation, Second Lieutenant Lloyd Herbert Hughes was awarded the Medal of Honor. Refusing to turn back although gasoline was streaming from his flak-damaged plane, Lt Hughes flew at low altitude over the blazing target area and bombed the objective. The plane crashed before Hughes could make the forced landing that he attempted after the bomb run. The detachment returned to England in August and the group flew several missions against airfields in France and the Netherlands. The unit deployed again temporarily to Tunisia during September and October 1943 with the group supporting Allied operations at Salerno and hit targets in Corsica, Italy, and Austria. Resumed operations from England in October 1943 the group concentrated primarily on strategic objectives in France, the Low Countries, and Germany. Targets included shipbuilding yards at Vegesack, industrial areas of Berlin, oil facilities at Merseburg, factories at M√ºnster, railroad yards at Sangerhausen, and V-weapon sites in the Pas de Calais. The group participated in the intensive air campaign against the German aircraft industry during Big Week, 20 ‚Äì 25 February 1944. Also flew support and interdictory missions on several occasions, bombing gun batteries and airfields in support of the Normandy invasion in June 1944, striking enemy positions to aid the breakthrough at Saint-L√¥ in July 1944, hitting storage depots and communications centres during the Battle of the Bulge (December 1944 ‚àí January 1945), and dropping food, ammunition, gasoline, and other supplies to troops participating in the airborne assault across the Rhine in March 1945. The 389th Bomb Group flew its last combat mission late in April 1945. It returned to Charleston AAF, South Carolina on 30 May 1945 and was inactivated on 13 September 1945. RAF Fighter Command use After the departure of the Americans, RAF Hethel airfield was returned to the RAF for use by Fighter Command. On 25 June, Polish RAF personnel manning North American Mustang squadrons flew to the airfield. In mid-1947, RAF Hethel became a Personnel Transit Centre but was transferred to RAF Technical Training Command. With the reduction of the RAF, the station closed in 1948. For many years the airfield was inactive and abandoned until it was finally sold by the Air Ministry in 1964. In 1948, the Nissen hut buildings around Marsworth airfield became home to around 900 Polish Displaced People. The camp was run by the National Assistance Board; the Polish camp was closed in 1960/61. There are a number of Polish graves in nearby All Saints Churchyard. Units; * No. 19 Personnel Transit Centre * No. 65 Squadron RAF * No. 126 Squadron RAF * No. 303 Squadron RAF * No. 316 Polish Fighter Squadron Current use For a number of years Nissen hut buildings were used to house many families awaiting re-housing under the post-war building programme. Forehoe & Henstead R D C also used part of the area as a store depot. This would have been during the 1950s era and this was a number of years before the Lotus Factory arrived. With the end of military control, Hethel found a new life in civilian hands becoming the manufacturing and testing site for Lotus Cars. The location of the factory is on the old technical site and the manufacture of vehicles, originally started in the old hangars and workshops, now takes place in several modern buildings. Lotus utilizes parts of the airfield perimeter track and lengths of the main runway as a testing track. Very little remains of any buildings on the dispersed sites around Hethel Wood; the only thing of real interest being a former gymnasium which became a chapel. On the end wall of this chapel, behind where the altar formerly stood, is a crucifix painted by the American \\"Bud\\" Doyle who was assistant to the Roman Catholic chaplain, Father Beck. It was painted in early 1944 and remains in good condition. The chapel has recently undergone extensive restoration carried out by a group of volunteers with the full support of the landowner. The chapel is on private property. The former 2nd Air Division Headquarters at Ketteringham Hall lies just to the north of the airfield. Group Lotus use it for their headquarters. In June 1946 a memorial plaque was dedicated in Carleton Rode Church, in memory of 17 members of the 389th Bomb Group who were killed in a mid-air collision over the parish on 21 November 1944. A stained glass window in the church is also dedicated to the crew members killed in this collision. A Memorial Headstone is located in the Hethel Churchyard and the 389th Roll of Honor is housed inside Hethel Church. Lotus Cars Interior of the Lotus Cars factory at the former Hethel Airfield. Lotus Cars is a British manufacturer of sports and racing cars. The company designs and builds race and production cars of light weight and high handling characteristics. In 1966 Lotus Cars moved into a purpose built factory on the site of the airfield and developed portions of the runways and taxiways as a test track for their cars. The factory and engineering centres cover of the former airfield, and use of the former runways. Much of the remaining runways have been removed and used to build roads, and returned to agricultural use. The layout can still be seen from aerial photos. Today the company also acts as an engineering consultancy, providing engineering development within the automotive industry. The company's racing arm, Lotus Racing, and the Lotus Driving Academy are also located at Hethel.

Huntington High School carries the Highlander mascot with the colors old gold and hunter green. The Huntington High Staff consists of a principal, five assistant principals, five counselors, 142 teachers, five secretaries, an athletic director, and 10 custodians. Eleven cooks staff the cafeteria and offer a variety of both hot and cold lunch selections daily.

Huntington High is accredited by the North Central Association. In 2010, Huntington High School was featured in Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution Television show on ABC. In 2016, after the filming of this television show focused on moderating eating habits and fighting obesity, the Cabell County Board of Education announced the school would pilot a program of unlimited and free food for all students regardless of socio-economic status. Huntington High School (which combined \\"Old\\" Huntington High School and Huntington East High School) was originally called Cabell West High School during the school project planning period. The name was then changed to Huntington Summit when the name of the other public high school in Cabell County was changed to Cabell Midland. The Cabell County Board of Education then decided that the new school should have connections to the two schools, Huntington High and Huntington East, that were being consolidated together. That is why the new school kept the Huntington High School name and then adopted the Highlanders nickname from the soon to be closed Huntington East High School.

History Tibenham was used as a Royal Flying Corps landing ground during the First World War and was known as RFC Tibenham. No. 51 Squadron RFC and 75 Sqn RFC allegedly used the landing ground. USAAF use The airfield was built up during 1941/42 as a standard heavy bomber airfield with a main runway (03-21) and two secondary runways in length (08-26, 15-33). It had an enclosed perimeter track containing 36 frying-pan type hardstands and fourteen loops. Two T-2 hangars were constructed on the eastern side of the airfield and adjacent to the technical site. Accommodations were constructed for about 2,900 personnel. Tibenham was assigned USAAF designation Station 124. 320th Bombardment Group (Medium) The first American units at Tibenham were the personnel of two Martin B-26 Marauder squadrons of the Twelfth Air Force 320th Bombardment Group (Medium) which were en route to La Senia Airfield, Algeria in November 1942. They had no aircraft and their stay was a matter of only a few days. During the summer of 1943, Tibenham was assigned to the 2d Bombardment Wing (later the 2d Air Division) and was used by a few Consolidated B-24 Liberator training aircraft, but it was not until November that the first combat units and their aircraft arrived. 445th Bombardment Group (Heavy) Tibenham became home to the 445th Bombardment Group (Heavy) of the United States Army Air Forces Eighth Air Force. The 445th arrived from Sioux City Army Air Base, Iowa on 4 November 1943. The 445th was assigned to the 2nd Combat Bombardment Wing, and the group tail code was a \\"Circle-F\\". Its operational squadrons were: * 700th Bombardment Squadron (IS); * 701st Bombardment Squadron (MK); * 702d Bombardment Squadron (WV); * 703d Bombardment Squadron (RN); The group flew B-24 Liberators as part of the Eighth Air Force's strategic bombing campaign. The 445th BG entered combat on 13 December 1943 by attacking U-boat installations at Kiel; only fifteen crews were considered fit for this mission which was heavily defended area. The unit operated primarily as a strategic bombardment organization until the war ended, striking such targets as industries in Osnabr√ºck, synthetic oil plants in Lutzendorf, chemical works in Ludwigshafen, marshalling yards at Hamm, an airfield at Munich, an ammunition plant at Duneberg, underground oil storage facilities at Ehmen, and factories at M√ºnster. Consolidated B-24 Liberators of the 445th Bomb Group on a mission over enemy-occupied territory. The group participated in the Allied campaign against the German aircraft industry during Big Week, 20 ‚Äì 25 February 1944, being awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation for attacking an aircraft assembly plant at Gotha on 24 February. The 389th Group was part of the Gotha mission but after their master bombardier collapsed dropped their bombs before the target and the 445th attacked alone. Thirteen of twenty-five aircraft were lost. It occasionally flew interdictory and support missions. It helped to prepare for the invasion of Normandy by bombing airfields, V-weapon sites, and other targets. The unit attacked shore installations on D-Day, 6 June 1944 and supported ground forces at Saint-L√¥ by striking enemy defences in July 1944. During the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944 ‚Äì January 1945 it bombed German communications. Early on 24 March 1945 dropped food, medical supplies, and ammunition to troops that landed near Wesel during the airborne assault across the Rhine and that afternoon flew a bombing mission to the same area, hitting a landing ground at Stormede. On occasion the unit dropped propaganda leaflets and hauled fuel to France. Awarded the Croix de guerre with Palm by the French government for operations in the theatre from December 1943 to February 1945 supplying the resistance. By far, the 445th's most notorious mission is the Kassel Mission of 27 September 1944. In cloud, the navigator of the lead bomber miscalculated and the 35 planes diverted from the rest of the 2nd Air Division and proceeded to G√∂ttingen some from the primary. After the bomb run, the group was attacked from the rear by an estimated 150 Luftwaffe planes, resulting in the most concentrated air battle in history. The Luftwaffe unit was a Stormgruppen, a special unit intended to attack bombers by flying in tight formations, up to ten fighters in line abreast. This tactic was intended to break the bomber formation at a single pass. The 361st Fighter Group intervened, preventing a complete destruction of the Group. Twenty-nine German fighters and 26 American planes (25 B-24 bombers and 1 P-51 Mustang) went down in a radius. Only four 445th planes made it back to the base; two made emergency landings at RAF Manston, two crashed in France, one in Belgium, another crashed near RAF Old Buckenham‚Äîrepresenting an 88.5% total casualty rate.History of the 445th Bomb Group, Revised Edition, 2010 The 445th Bomb Group flew its last combat mission on 25 April 1945. It departed Tibenham and returned to Fort Dix AAF New Jersey on 28 May 1945. James Stewart, the film actor, was 703rd Squadron Commander with the 445th when it arrived at Tibenham. He flew 10 operational missions with the 445th Bomb Group before being transferred to the 453rd Bomb Group at RAF Old Buckenham in March, 1944 Postwar use The Americans left in late May 1945 and on 15 July the airfield reverted to the Air Ministry becoming a Maintenance Unit satellite. No. 4247 Anti-Aircraft Flight RAF Regiment was posted here at some point. Although part of the airfield was sold off in 1952, the main runway was lengthened in 1955 for possible use by jet aircraft. However it was never utilized and Tibenham was closed in 1959, being sold during 1964/65. Current use Since 1960 the airfield has been used for peaceful recreation by the sailplanes of the Norfolk Gliding Club. In civilian hands most of the wartime airfield buildings were demolished; however, there are a few derelict huts and other structures on some of the dispersed sites which lay to the east between the airfield and the main London-Norwich railway line. Most of the main runway with its postwar extension still exists, along with both secondary runways. The perimeter track and various hardstands, however, have been removed for hardcore. The control tower was used until 1975 as a club house by the Gliding Club. Later that year the club moved into a new home which was constructed nearby. It was said that the old control tower was haunted; and at least four members of the Gliding Club were afraid to enter the building, even in daytime. It was reported that a person in flying clothes, similar to those worn by the USAAF combat crews, had been seen on several occasions wandering through the darkened rooms. The old control tower was demolished in 1978 after the new clubhouse came into use. Current projects include plans for a Heritage Centre to preserve the history of the airfield and the connection with the 445th Bomb Group. A memorial to the Liberator crews stands on the airfield.

Despite strong sales into the 1990s, Pudding Pops were eventually discontinued, due to not being profitable. They were reintroduced to grocery stores in April 2004, under the brand name Popsicle. However, due to differences in texture to the original and different shape, popularity never reached its predecessors, which resulted in them beginning to be pulled from stores around 2011. Pudding Pops come in the variety pack of chocolate, vanilla and chocolate vanilla swirl, which have ninety calories per serving, three grams of fat, and fifteen grams of carbohydrates.

As one of the many post-independence secondary schools to be built in Zimbabwe, it was named after a famous freedom fighter, Josiah Tongogara, as an honour to his exploits in the Rhodesian Bush War. The school is situated in the homeland of the former fighter. It is only 15 km from Chachacha business centre, 18 km from the iconic Chinogwenya village and the District Heroes Acre. The first A-level enrollment was in 1989. Boarding facilities were extended to the lower grades from 1990. There is also a continuing education program for those who would like to advance their education. The school has produced notable graduates who have gone to make a different both at home and in Zimbabwean diaspora. This school is located in Mvura village. Students at this school usually go to Mvura Seventh Day Adventist church because it is nearer, and it is believed that almost everyone in Mvura Village is an Adventist. The church has been very supportive in grooming the students. Graduates from this school who have gone far: Burombo Mudhumo, Upenyu Mzimbani, Jotham Zvinongoza, Chamson Matanda, Mapingire, Dry Mativenga, Felix Mutasa, Tapiwa Dobo and Munyaradzi Dobo - the twins who are qualified chartered accountants, Comfort and Armstrong Mvura who are believed to have left the school for diaspora and have been supportive to all the residents in the village. The most respected teachers were Mr. Chikondo the headmaster, Mr. Madhina, Mrs. Bere, Mr. Musvavairi, Mrs. Musvavairi, Mr. Maharani, Mr. Sanudi, Mr. Shumba, Mr. Hlerema, Muhlahlo and Mr. Tandavara. The first students to attend the school were 120 coming from Matamba Primary, Mavedzenge Primary and Tumba in 1982. The First Headmaster was Mr. W Chikumba assisted by Mr. Munhumeso, Mr Matongo and Mr Gombingo. Mr Chikumba was succeeded by Mr. C Magoma, Mr Makamure, Mr. Chikondo and Mrs. Musvavairi. The first O Level were of November 1985, and the first intake for A Level was in 1986. Tongogara was once headed by Amai Mangoma the headmistress. On the 23rd of October 2019, there was a fire incident which reduced the boys hostel to ashes. The origins of the fire were unclear, it is believed that someone left his candle burning as there was no electricity due to load shedding. On the 24th of October 2019, Unki mine offered accommodation to all the boys in the boarding and also to transport them to school every morning until the hostel is completely restored.

It was given designation USAAF Air Station 144. 453rd Bombardment Group (Heavy) The airfield was opened in late 1943 and was used by the 453rd Bombardment Group (Heavy), arriving from March Field, California on 23 December 1943. The 453d was assigned to the 2nd Combat Bombardment Wing, and the group tail code was a \\"Circle-J\\". Its operational squadrons were: * 732d Bombardment Squadron (E3) * 733d Bombardment Squadron (F8) * 734th Bombardment Squadron (E8) * 735th Bombardment Squadron (H6) The group flew Consolidated B-24 Liberators as part of the Eighth Air Force's strategic bombing campaign. The 453d BG entered combat on 5 February 1944 with an attack against an airfield at Tours. Throughout combat, the unit served chiefly as a strategic bombardment organization. Targets included a fuel depot at D√ºlmen, marshalling yards at Paderborn, aircraft assembly plants at Gotha, railway centres at Hamm, an ordnance depot at Glinde, oil refineries at Gelsenkirchen, chemical works at Leverkusen, an airfield at Neum√ºnster, a canal at Minden, and a railway viaduct at Altenbeken. The group took part in the concentrated attack against the German aircraft industry during \\"Big Week\\", 20‚Äì25 February 1944. Besides strategic operations, the group engaged in support and interdiction missions. Bombed V-weapon sites, airfields, and gun batteries in France prior to the invasion of Normandy in June 1944; on 6 June hit shore installations between Le Havre and Cherbourg and other enemy positions farther inland. Attacked enemy troops in support of the Allied breakthrough at Saint-L√¥ in July. Bombed German communications during the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944-January 1945. Ferried cargo on two occasions: hauled gasoline, blankets, and rations to France in September 1944; dropped ammunition, food, and medical supplies near Wesel during the airborne assault across the Rhine in March 1945. James \\"Jimmy\\" Stewart, the Hollywood movie star, was Group Operations Officer at Old Buckenham during the spring of 1944. Stewart's fellow actor Walter Matthau was also based at Old Buckenham. The 453d Bomb Group flew its last combat mission in April. Initially it was prepared for possible redeployment to the Pacific theatre using Boeing B-29 Superfortresses. However hostilities in Europe had ceased before the group had time to start its movement and it returned to New Castle AAFld, Delaware on 9 May 1945 to be inactivated on 12 September 1945.

Five American men were killed in an ambush, including \\"Old Man\\" Clanton, the alleged leader. They were believed to belong to the Cowboys, an outlaw group based in Pima and Cochise counties in Arizona. Two men survived the attack. The canyon straddles the modern Arizona and New Mexico state line and connects the Animas Valley of New Mexico with the San Bernardino Valley of Arizona. During the American Old West, the canyon was a key route for smugglers into and out of Mexico. The two survivors said they had been attacked by Mexicans. Historians generally believe that the smugglers were killed by Mexican military forces patrolling the border to try to reduce smuggling. Some sources repeat the assertion of attorney William McLaury, who was part of the prosecution related to the 1881 gunfight at the O.K. Corral, in which two of his brothers had been killed. He wrote that Wyatt Earp and his two brothers had killed Clanton and his associates, and this has been repeated in some sources.  Background  The Cowboys were a large group of loosely associated American outlaws based in Pima and Cochise counties in Arizona. Various members had on numerous occasions crossed the border into Mexico where they stole cattle; they drove them across the border to sell them in the United States, especially for meat to the booming mining camps. The Mexican government at the time placed high tariffs on goods transported across the border, resulting in smuggling being a profitable enterprise. In July 1881, several Mexican smugglers heading for Tucson or Tombstone and carrying silver were ambushed and killed in an area called Skeleton Canyon. The killers were never positively identified, but Mexicans just across the border always suspected that those murders were committed by outlaw Cowboys. A ranch owned by \\"Old Man\\" Clanton in the Animas Valley in New Mexico was used at times by the Cowboys as a way station for selling the stolen cattle. Old Man Clanton was suspected of also participating in the smuggling. Although his ranch did not own a brand, which was required for cattle operations, it was one of the most profitable cattle ranches in that part of the country.  Ambush  In August 1881, Mexican Commandant Felipe Neri dispatched troops to the border. The Mexicans found \\"Old Man\\" Clanton and six others bedded down for the night in Guadalupe Canyon with a herd of cattle. The Mexicans waited until dawn to attack the group, killing five of the Cowboys. Some researchers theorize that Mexican Rurales, led by Captain Alfredo Carrillo, who had survived the Skeleton Canyon Massacre in 1879, led the ambush of the Cowboys. The dead included Old Man Clanton; Charley Snow, a ranch hand who heard a noise and was the first killed; Jim Crane, who was wanted for a March 1881 stagecoach robbery near Tombstone, during which two men had been murdered; Dick Gray, son of Col. Mike Gray; and Billy Lang, a cattle rancher.Arizona Weekly Citizen August 12, 1881 Crane and Gray were either still in their bedrolls or getting dressed when killed. Clanton was cooking breakfast for the camp when shot and he fell dead into the cookfire. Lang was the only one who had a chance to fight back. One man was wounded: Harry Ernshaw, a milk farmer, was grazed by a bullet on the nose. Billy Byers feigned death until the attackers left. Ernshaw found his way to the ranch of John Pleasant Gray (Dick's brother), who enlisted help from a mining camp away. When the group returned to Guadalupe Canyon, they found the dead men stripped naked. They finally found a dazed Billy Byers five miles away. Snow was buried where he fell due to decomposition. The other bodies were taken back by wagon and buried about ten miles east of Cloverdale, New Mexico. In 1882 Ike and Phin Clanton exhumed their father's body and moved it to the Boot Hill cemetery in Tombstone, Arizona. He was re-interred alongside his son Billy Clanton, who had been killed two months after his father, in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.  Identity of the attackers  Survivors Ernshaw and Byers claimed that the attackers were Mexican, and repeated that Dick Gray had said this, too, before he was killed. Ike and Phin Clanton later sent the Byers family a photograph of their father; across the back they had written, \\"Mr. Clanton killed on Aug 13‚Äî81 by Mexicans with 4 other Americans in Guadalupe Canon [sic] New Mexico.\\" Both men signed the statement. A contemporary photograph of Will G. Lang bears a similar inscription: \\"Will G. Lang killed by Mexicans‚ÄîAnimas Valley New Mexico Aug 13, 1881 together with Gray, Crane, Clanton and Snow and Byers wounded.\\" Rumors surfaced later in 1881 that Virgil, Morgan, and Wyatt Earp had killed Old Man Clanton. The first known account is in a letter from attorney William R. McLaury to his brother-in-law, David D. Appelgate on November 19, 1881. McLaury was passionately convinced that the Earps and Doc Holliday had murdered his younger brothers Frank and Tom during the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. He was a member of the prosecution team that was presenting evidence during the preliminary hearing on the event before Judge Wells Spicer that month. The rumor of the Earps' involvement has been repeated in a number of publications based solely on William McLaury's assertion.

B-24 of the 44th Bomb Group hit by enemy fire on a mission over enemy territory. Medal of Honor Ceremony for Col Leon Johnson at Shipdham Airfield, 1943. Final approach on NE-SW runway, September 2008. Royal Air Force Shipdham or more simply RAF Shipdham is a former Royal Air Force station located 3 miles south of Dereham, Norfolk, England. The airfield now operates as Shipdham Airfield. History USAAF use RAF Shipdham was the first US heavy bomber base in Norfolk and was also the continuous host to Consolidated B-24 Liberators longer than any other Eighth Air Force combat airfield in Britain - from October 1942 to late 1945. It was constructed 1941-42 and was assigned USAAF designation Station 115 (SJ). From 13 September 1943 though 13 June 1945, Shipdham served as headquarters for the 14th Combat Bombardment Wing, 2d Air Division, VIII Bomber Command (later Eighth Air Force). 319th Bombardment Group (Medium) The 319th Bombardment Group (Medium) was a Twelfth Air Force Martin B-26 Marauder medium bomber group which arrived at Shipdham on 12 September 1942 from Harding Army Air Field, Louisiana. The personnel of the group used the base as a staging and assembly point before moving in early October for RAF Horsham St Faith in Norfolk. From there the unit moved to Algeria in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO) in November as part of the Operation Torch invasion forces. 44th Bombardment Group (Heavy) With the departure of the 319th BG, Shipdham was assigned to the 44th Bombardment Group (Heavy), arriving from Will Rogers Field, Oklahoma on 10 October 1942. The 44th was assigned to the 14th Combat Bombardment Wing, and the group tail code was a \\"Circle-A\\". Its operational squadrons were: * 66th Bombardment Squadron (WQ) * 67th Bombardment Squadron (NB) * 68th Bombardment Squadron (QK) * 506th Bombardment Squadron (GJ) The group flew Consolidated B-24 Liberators as part of the Eighth Air Force's strategic bombing campaign. The 44th was the first USAAF group to be equipped with the Liberator and the unit had helped form other groups destined to fly the type. The Group was initially under strength, one of its four squadrons having been detached in the US. In March 1943 the 506th Squadron was assigned to the group. The 44th Bomb Group's operations consisted primarily of assaults against strategic targets in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Romania, Austria, Poland, and Sicily. Among the targets attacked were submarine installations, industrial establishments, airfields, harbors, shipyards, and other objectives, November 1942 - June 1943. The unit received a Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC) for an extremely hazardous mission against naval installations at Kiel on 14 May 1943: Its B-24's flew in the wake of the main formation and carried incendiaries to be dropped after three Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress groups had released high explosive bombs, thus the group's aircraft were particularly vulnerable lacking the protection of the firepower of the main force. This vulnerability increased when the group opened its own formation for the attack; but the 44th blanketed the target with incendiaries in spite of the concentrated flak and continuous interceptor attacks it encountered. Late in June 1943 a large detachment moved to Libya to help facilitate the Allied invasion of Sicily by bombing airfields and marshalling yards in Italy. The detachment also participated in the famous low-level raid on the Ploesti oil fields on 1 August 1943. The group was awarded a DUC for its part in this raid and its commander, Colonel Leon W. Johnson, was awarded the Medal of Honor for his daring and initiative in leading his men into smoke, flame, and alerted fighter and antiaircraft opposition over the target, which already had been bombed in error by another group. Before returning to England at the end of August, the detachment bombed an aircraft factory in Austria and supported ground forces in Sicily. In September 1943 the group struck airfields in the Netherlands and France and convoys in the North Sea. Also in September, a detachment was sent to North Africa to support the Salerno operations. This proved to be the 44th's last detachment and in October when several new B-24 groups were arriving in Norfolk, the 44th was fully committed to the combined bomber offensive from the UK. From November 1943 to April 1945, the group carried out operations against targets in western Europe, concentrating on airfields, oil installations, and marshalling yards. The group took part in the intensive campaign of heavy bombers against the German aircraft industry during Big Week, 20‚Äì25 February 1944. The group flew support and interdictory missions. Struck airfields, railroads, and V-weapon sites in preparation for the Normandy invasion; supported the invasion in June 1944 by attacking strong points in the beachhead area and transportation targets behind the front lines. The group aided the Caen offensive and the Saint-L√¥ breakthrough in July. Dropped food, ammunition, and other supplies to troops engaged in the airborne attack on the Netherlands in September. The group also helped to check the enemy offensive during the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944-January 1945, by striking bridges, tunnels, choke points, rail and road junctions, and communications in the battle area. The group attacked airfields and transportation in support of the advance into Germany, and flew a resupply mission during the airborne assault across the Rhine in March 1945. The 44th Bomb Group flew its last combat mission on 25 April 1945. During the course of hostilities, the 44th flew a total of 343 missions and its gunners were credited with 330 enemy fighters shot down and its own losses. highest of any B-24 group in the Eighth, were 153. The unit returned to Sioux Falls Army Airfield South Dakota in June 1945. Legacy Reassigned to Great Bend Army Airfield, Kansas 25 July 1945. In preparation for Operation Downfall - overall Allied plan for the invasion of Japan the group was redesignated the 44th Bombardment Group (Very Heavy) in August 1945 in preparation for receiving Boeing B-29 Superfortresses. Assigned to Strategic Air Command on 21 March 1946. Reassigned to Smoky Hill Army Airfield, Kansas, 14 December 1945. Inactivated 12 July 1946. Air Ministry use Between 1946 and 1947, the airfield was used as a transit centre for German POWs a route from the United States for repatriation to Germany. The base was also home to No. 258 Maintenance Unit RAF Part of Shipdham was sold in 1957 and the remainder between 1962 and 1963. Current use With the end of military control Arrow Air Services acquired the airfield from a local farmer and applied for planning permission to re-open the airfield. This was granted in September 1969 and, the following April. work began on refurbishing the facility. Two of the concrete runways were refurbished together with the approach road and perimeter track. The runway lights were found to be still serviceable although they had to be brought up to modern standards. Shipdham was opened to private flying on 16 June 1970 and currently is the home of the Shipdham Aero Club. Its clubhouse is home to their museum and the airfield is unlicensed. Most of the airfield buildings remain in various states of decay with part of the site being in use as an industrial estate. In 2012, Powererd Paraglider training operation - Ufly4fun Pilots Club moved to the airfield from Northrepps Aerodrome.

Eleven signals were observed, of which two were attributed to other processes. In 1997 similar observations were announced at Fermilab from the E862 experiment.

Grassi on the comets The context of the essay was to reply to the treatise Libra astronomica ac philosophica of 1619 by Orazio Grassi, a Jesuit mathematician at the Collegio Romano, which used the pseudonym of Lotario Sarsi Sigensano. The debate between Galileo and Grassi started in 1618, when the latter published Disputatio astronomica de tribus cometis anni MDCXVIII, in which he asserted that comets are celestial bodies. Grassi adopted Tycho Brahe's Tychonic system, in which the other planets of the Solar System orbit around the Sun, which, in turn, orbits around the Earth. In his Disputatio Grassi referenced many of Galileo's observations, such as the surface of the Moon and the phases of Venus, without mentioning him. Grassi argued from the apparent absence of observable parallax that comets move beyond the Moon. Galileo mistakenly believed that comets are an optical illusion. Science, mathematics, and philosophy In 1616 Galileo may have been silenced on Copernicanism. In 1623 his supporter and friend, Cardinal Maffeo Barberini, a former patron of the Accademia dei Lincei and uncle of future Cardinal Francesco Barberini, became Pope Urban VIII. The election of Barberini seemed to assure Galileo of support at the highest level in the Church. A visit to Rome confirmed this. The Assayer is a milestone in the history of science: here Galileo describes the scientific method, which was quite a revolution at the time. The title page of The Assayer shows the crest of the Barberini family, featuring three busy bees. In The Assayer, Galileo weighs the astronomical views of a Jesuit, Orazio Grassi, and finds them wanting. The book was dedicated to the new pope. The title page also shows that Urban VIII employed a member of the Lynx, Cesarini, at a high level in the papal service. This book was edited and published by members of the Lynx. In The Assayer Galileo mainly criticized Grassi's method of inquiry, heavily biased by his religious belief and based on ipse dixit, rather than his hypothesis on comets. Furthermore, he insisted that natural philosophy (i.e. physics) should be mathematical. According to the title page, he was the philosopher (i.e. physicist) of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, not merely the mathematician. Natural philosophy (physics) spans the gamut from processes of generation and growth (represented by a plant) to the physical structure of the universe, represented by the cosmic cross-section. Mathematics, on the other hand, is symbolized by telescopes, and an astrolabe. This is the book containing Galileo‚Äôs famous statement that mathematics is the language of science. Only through mathematics can one achieve lasting truth in physics. Those who neglect mathematics wander endlessly in a dark labyrinth. From the book:Galileo Galilei, The Assayer, as translated by Stillman Drake (1957), Discoveries and Opinions of Galileo pp. 237-8. Galileo used a sarcastic and witty tone throughout the essay. The book was read with delight at the dinner table by Urban VIII., p. 131 In 1620 Maffeo Barberini wrote a poem entitled Adulatio Perniciosa in Galileo's honor.The Galileo Project An official, Giovanni di Guevara, said that The Assayer was free from any unorthodoxy.William A.

He is currently a radio sports pundit for BBC Scotland. Football career  Playing  Preston, who predominantly played at left-back, began his career as a 15-year-old with Dundee United in 1985. He made his league debut in the 1987/88 season. After spending several years at Tannadice, he signed for Hearts, the team he supported as a boy. After brief spells with Hearts and Dunfermline Athletic he joined St Johnstone in 1994. It was in Perth that he played the most consistent football of his career. Management In June 2000, after a hip injury ended his playing career, Preston became assistant to Macclesfield Town manager Peter Davenport, whom he had played with at St Johnstone. Preston left Macclesfield within a year to return to Scotland with Livingston as a coach, and in June 2004 he became the club's manager. He brought in another former St. Johnstone teammate, Alan Kernaghan, as his assistant, Kernagahan had been player/manager at Clyde. In November 2004, after just fifteen games in charge, Preston and Kernaghan were sacked after the team's seventh successive defeat. The following month he joined his current employer, Stellar Scotland, a subsidiary of The Stellar Group Limited, alongside former St. Johnstone teammates John Inglis and Paul Cherry. Preston was unsuccessful in his application to be St Johnstone manager in April 2005 and thus his Livingston job represents his last football role. Media career Preston has been a pundit on BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound since 2008 and is nicknamed Biscuits.

Opened in 1942 it was used by both the Royal Air Force (RAF) and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). During the war it was used primarily as a bomber airfield, being the home of the United States Army Air Forces Eighth Air Force 392nd Bombardment Group. After the war, it was used by the RAF as a standby airfield before being finally closed in 1961 and returned to agriculture. With the end of military control the airfield has become a turkey farm. History RAF Wendling (Wendling airfield) was originally planned for RAF Bomber Command use, however in 1942 was assigned as a United States Army Air Forces heavy bomber installation. It was the most northerly placed of Eighth Air Force heavy bomber fields and was built by Taylor-Woodrow Ltd in 1942. The airfield featured a long main runway angled on a NE-SW axis and two intersecting long secondary runways, all within a perimeter track and constructed of reinforced concrete. Another twenty hardstands (loop type) were added to the thirty of the frying-pan type when the airfield was rescheduled as an Eighth Air Force heavy bomber station. Two T2-type hangars were provided plus the usual full technical facilities, Mark II airfield lighting and dispersed accommodation for some 2,900 persons. The domestic sites were in the parish of Beeston to the west of the airfield and the bomb dump and ammunition stores were in Honeypot Wood to the south-east. United States Army Air Forces use Under USAAF control, RAF Wendling was designated as Station 118. 392nd Bombardment Group (Heavy) The airfield was opened in 1943 and was used by the 392d Bombardment Group (Heavy), arriving from Alamogordo Army Airfield, New Mexico in the south west of the US, on 18 July 1943. The 453rd was assigned to the 14th Combat Bombardment Wing, and the group tail code was a \\"Circle-D\\". Its operational squadrons were: * 576th Bombardment Squadron (CI). * 577th Bombardment Squadron (DC). * 578th Bombardment Squadron (EC). * 579th Bombardment Squadron (GC). The group flew Consolidated B-24 Liberators as part of the Eighth Air Force's strategic bombing campaign. The 392d BG entered combat on 9 September 1943 and engaged primarily in bombardment of strategic objectives on the Continent until April 1945. The group attacked such targets as an oil refinery at Gelsenkirchen, a marshalling yard at Osnabr√ºck, a railroad viaduct at Bielefeld, steel plants at Brunswick, a tank factory at Kassel, and gas works at Berlin. The group took part in the intensive campaign of heavy bombers against the German aircraft industry during Big Week, 20 ‚Äì 25 February 1944, being awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC) for bombing an aircraft and component parts factory at Gotha on 24 February. The unit sometimes supported ground forces or carried out interdictory operations along with bombing airfields and V-weapon sites in France prior to the Normandy invasion in June 1944 and struck coastal defences and choke points on D-Day. The group hit enemy positions to assist ground forces at Saint-L√¥ during the breakthrough in July 1944. Bombed railroads, bridges, and highways to cut off German supply lines during the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944 ‚Äì January 1945. Dropped supplies to Allied troops during the air attack on Holland in September 1944 and during the airborne assault across the Rhine in March 1945. The 392nd Bomb Group flew its last combat mission on 25 April 1945, then carried food to the Dutch. The unit returned to Charleston Army Airfield South Carolina, in the north east of the USA on 25 June 1945 and was inactivated on 13 September 1945. Royal Air Force use When the Americans left, Wendling RAF was returned to the Air Ministry and transferred to RAF Maintenance Command and was used by No. 258 Maintenance Unit RAF as a stand-by airfield, later becoming an inactive station before being finally closed on 22 November 1961. The airfield was also home to No. 4249 Anti-Aircraft Flight RAF Regiment. It was used between June 1960 and April 1964 by the United States Air Force as a radio facility before being finally closed and sold in 1964. Current use With the end of military control the airfield has become a turkey farm, with large coops built along its runways. Most of the buildings and hardstands have been torn down and the concrete removed. Also much of the perimeter track has been reduced to a single lane road. A granite obelisk monument to the men of the 392nd Bomb Group and stands well maintained and cared for in a small plot just off the airfield on the road to Beeston.

Scanning ion-conductance microscopy (SICM) is a scanning probe microscopy technique that uses an electrode as the probe tip. SICM allows for the determination of the surface topography of micrometer and even nanometer-range structures in aqueous media conducting electrolytes. The samples can be hard or soft, are generally non- conducting, and the non-destructive nature of the measurement allows for the observation of living tissues and cells, and biological samples in general. It is able to detect steep profile changes in samples and can be used to map a living cell's stiffness in tandem with its detailed topography, or to determine the mobility of cells during their migrations.Happel, P.; Wehner, F.; Dietzel, I.D. Scanning ion conductance microscopy‚Äìa tool to investigate electrolyte-nonconductor interfaces. In Modern Research and Educational Topics in Microscopy; FORMATEX: Badajoz, Spain, 2007; pp. 968‚Äì975.  Working principle  Scanning ion conductance microscopy is a technique using the increase of access resistance in a micro-pipette in an electrolyte-containing aqueous medium when it approaches a poorly conducting surface. It monitors the ionic current flowing in and out of the micro/nano-pipette, which is hindered if the tip is very close to the sample surface since the gap through which ions can flow is reduced in size. The SICM setup is generally as follows: A voltage is applied between the two Ag/AgCl electrodes, one of which is in the glass micro-pipette, and the other in the bulk solution. The voltage will generate an ionic current between the two electrodes, flowing in and out of the micro-pipette. The conductance between the two electrodes is measured, and depends on the flux of ions. Movements of the pipette are regulated through piezoelectrics. The micro-pipette is lowered closer and closer to the sample until the ionic flux starts to be restricted. The conductance of the system will then decrease (and the resistance will increase). When this resistance reaches a certain threshold the tip is stopped and the position recorded. The tip is then moved (in different ways depending on the mode used, see below) and another measurement is made in a different location, and so on. In the end, comparing the positions of all the measurements provides a detailed height profile of the sample. It is important to note that the tip is stopped before contacting the sample, thus it does not bend nor damage the surface observed, which is one of the major advantages of SICM.  Equivalent circuit  Equivalent electrical circuit of a SICM setup. The total resistance of the setup (Rtot) is the sum of the three resistances: Rb, Rm, and Rt. Rb the resistance of the electrolyte solution between the tip of the micro-pipette and the electrode in the bulk of the solution. Rm is the resistance of the electrolyte solution between the electrode in the micro-pipette and the tip. Rt is the resistance of the current flowing through the tip Rb and Rm depend on the electrolyte conductivity, and the position and shape of the Ag/AgCl electrodes. Rt depends on the size and shape of the aperture, and on the distance between the tip and the sample. All the parameters except the distance between tip and sample are constant within a given SICM setup, thus it is the variation of Rt with the distance to the sample that will be used to determine the topography of the sample. Usual approximations are: 1) the voltage drop at the surfaces of the Ag/AgCl electrodes is neglected, it is assumed that it is negligible compared to the voltage drop at the tip, and constant, 2) the fact that the bulk resistance is a function of d is neglected since it depends on the distance between the tip and the electrode in the bulk.  Comparison with other scanning probe microscopy techniques  SICM has a worse resolution than AFM or STM, which can routinely reach resolutions of about 0.1 nm. The resolution of SICM measurement is limited to 1.5 times the diameter of the tip opening in theory, but measurements taken with a 13 nm opening-diameter managed a resolution of around 3‚Äì6 nm. SICM can be used to image poorly or non-conducting surfaces, which is impossible with STM. In SICM measurements, the tip of the micro-pipette does not touch the surface of the sample; which allows the imaging of soft samples (cells, biological samples, cell villi) without deformation. SICM is used in an electrolyte-containing solution, so can be used in physiological media and image living cells and tissues, and monitor biological processes while they are taking place. In hopping mode, it is able to correctly determine profiles with steep slopes and grooves.  Imaging modes  There are four main imaging modes in SICM: constant-z mode, Direct current (constant distance) mode, alternating current mode, and hopping/backstep/standing approach mode.  Constant-z mode  Trajectory of a SICM probe in constant-z mode. In constant-z mode, the micro- pipette is maintained at a constant z (height) while it is moved laterally and the resistance is monitored, its variations allowing for the reconstitution of the topography of the sample. This mode is fast but is barely used since it only works on very flat samples. If the sample has rugged surfaces, the pipette will either crash into it, or be too far for imaging most of the sample.  Direct current mode  Trajectory of a SICM probe in DC mode In direct current (DC) mode (constant distance mode), the micro-pipette is lowered toward the sample until a predefined resistance is reached. The pipette is then moved laterally and a feedback loop maintains the distance to the sample (through the resistance value). The z-position of the pipette determines the topography of the sample. This mode does not detect steep slopes in sample, may contact the sample in such cases and is prone to electrode drift.  Alternating current mode  Trajectory of a SICM probe in AC mode In alternating current (AC) mode, the micro-pipette oscillates vertically in addition to its usual movement. While the pipette is still far from the surface the ionic current, and the resistance is steady, so the pipette is lowered. Once the resistance starts oscillating, the amplitude serves as feedback to modulate the position until a predefined amplitude is reached. The response of the AC component increases much steeper than the DC, and allows for the recording of more complex samples.  Hopping mode  Trajectory of a SICM probe in hopping mode. In hopping (/backstep/standing approach) mode, the micro-pipette is lowered to the sample until a given resistance is reached, and the height is recorded. Then the pipette is dragged back, laterally moved and another measurement is made, and the process repeats. The topography of the sample can then be reconstituted. Hopping mode is slower than the others, but is able to image complex topography and even entire cells, without distorting the sample surface..  Combinations with other techniques, and alternative uses  SICM was used to image a living neural cell from rat brain, determine the life cycle of microvilli, observe the movement of protein complexes in spermatozoa. SICM has been combined with fluorescence microscopy and f√∂rster resonance energy transfer. SICM has been used in a \\"smart patch-clamp\\" technique, clamping the pipette by suction to the surface of a cell and then monitoring the activity of the sodium channels in the cell membrane. A combination of AFM and SICM was able to obtain high resolution images of synthetic membranes in ionic solutions. Scanning near- field optical microscopy has been used with SICM; the SICM measurement allowed for the tip of the pipette to be placed very close to the surface of the sample. Fluorescent particles, coming from the inside of the micro-pipette, provide a light source for the SNOM that is being continuously renewed and prevent photobleaching. FSICM (Fast SICM), improving notably the speed of hopping mode has recently been developed.

An earlier name for a tensile testing machine is a tensometer. The \\"universal\\" part of the name reflects that it can perform many standard tensile and compression tests on materials, components, and structures (in other words, that it is versatile). Components Several variations are in use. Common components include: * Load frame - Usually consisting of two strong supports for the machine. Some small machines have a single support. * Load cell - A force transducer or other means of measuring the load is required. Periodic calibration is usually required by governing regulations or quality system. * Cross head - A movable cross head (crosshead) is controlled to move up or down. Usually this is at a constant speed: sometimes called a constant rate of extension (CRE) machine. Some machines can program the crosshead speed or conduct cyclical testing, testing at constant force, testing at constant deformation, etc. Electromechanical, servo- hydraulic, linear drive, and resonance drive are used. * Means of measuring extension or deformation - Many tests require a measure of the response of the test specimen to the movement of the cross head. Extensometers are sometimes used. * Output device - A means of providing the test result is needed. Some older machines have dial or digital displays and chart recorders. Many newer machines have a computer interface for analysis and printing. * Conditioning - Many tests require controlled conditioning (temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.). The machine can be in a controlled room or a special environmental chamber can be placed around the test specimen for the test. * Test fixtures, specimen holding jaws, and related sample making equipment are called for in many test methods. Use The set-up and usage are detailed in a test method, often published by a standards organization. This specifies the sample preparation, fixturing, gauge length (the length which is under study or observation), analysis, etc. The specimen is placed in the machine between the grips and an extensometer if required can automatically record the change in gauge length during the test. If an extensometer is not fitted, the machine itself can record the displacement between its cross heads on which the specimen is held. However, this method not only records the change in length of the specimen but also all other extending / elastic components of the testing machine and its drive systems including any slipping of the specimen in the grips. Once the machine is started it begins to apply an increasing load on specimen. Throughout the tests the control system and its associated software record the load and extension or compression of the specimen. Machines range from very small table top systems to ones with over 53 MN (12 million lbf) capacity.

The area between the town and the rural areas was mainly occupied by white commercial farmers. It is thought that at one time, these farms were owned by three families who were all related. The total area of these farms is approximately 60 km x 40 km similar to an area that was occupied by more than 4,000 African families. Most of the black families are subsistence farmers. Maize is generally grown by the majority. Education Primary schools There are a number of primary schools in Shurugwi Rural. Most of them, like Vungwi Primary School, were built as far back as 1905. The list includes: Banga,Bokai, Chekenyu, Dhlemiti,Chikato, Dombwe, Hanke, Makonde (St Monica),Makotore, Matamba, Mavedzenge (St Peter), Mhangami (St Pius), Ndaora (St Paul), Nhema (St Francis), Pakame,Rusike Shamba, Tumba, Vungwi,Gundura, Banga, Wida,Sibolise, Charles Wreath and Zvishazha. Secondary schools There are a number of secondary schools in Shurugwi Rural, notably Sibolise Secondary School,Mupangai Secondary School, Chivakanenyanga Secondary School, Batanai Secondary School, Rusungunuko Secondary School, Dombotombo Secondary School, Chironde-Kwagweya Secondary School, and Bokai Secondary School, among others. The academic results from year to year are generally poor and below par which is generally blamed on the teachers. High schools There are only three boarding schools in Shurugwi which are all in rural areas: Hanke Adventist High School, a Seventh-day Adventist school which traditionally offered up to 0-Levels and was called Hanke Adventist Secondary School. It was recently upgraded to offer all levels through A-Levels and changed its name to reflect that. As it is a mission school, both the primary school and the high school are on the same campus which can cause confusion between them. Tongogara High School, only 10 km from Hanke, is a government-run high school. The boarding facilities are generally reserved for A-Levels students while the Form 1s to Form 4s are general day-schoolers (although a limited number of lower grade students have been admitted into boarding since 1990). Tongogara was founded as a secondary school in the early 1980s and A-Level was only introduced in 1989. It is the biggest high school in Shurugwi by student population. Pakame Mission, about 40 km to the southwest, is a Methodist-run mission. Like Hanke, it traditionally offered classes up to form 4 (O-Levels), but was recently upgraded to offer up to A-Levels. Pakame is considered the best of the three in terms of O-Level pass rate. Rusununguko is now a high school offering A levels as well. Rusununguko High School which is 4 km was of late upgraded to offer A levels, this is the only non boarding high school in Shurugwi. This schools caters for talented students from disadvantaged families mainly from its neighboring secondary schools such as Mupangai, Bokai. The pass rate from Rusununguko is not bad, most students walk +/- 15 km to and from school. Most students who come through these walls normally fails to progress with their education because of university fees challenges Health Hospitals Zvamavande Rural Hospital is the only hospital in Shurugwi Rural. It is located 2 km southeast of Cha Cha Cha Township, 2 km southwest of Vungwi Primary School and 7 km northeast of Rusununguko Secondary School. Clinics There are a number of rural clinics in Shurugwi Rural. Notable clinics include Hanke Clinic, on the same campus as Hanke Mission; Saint Francis Clinic, near the residence of Chief Nhema and facilitated by his politician son, Francis Nhema, about 40 km northeast of Cha Cha Cha Township and 20 km northeast of Hanke Adventist Secondary School; and Tongogara Clinic, situated at Tongogara Shopping Centre. There is also Gundura clinic, about 5 km from Pakame Mission. There is also Rusike clinic about 15 km south of Cha Cha Cha. Zvamavande Hospital is the referral centre for all other clinics in the region which often transfers patients to Shurugwi Hospital in Shurugwi. People still walk long distances to health centres. Serious cases are sometimes transported up to 10 km by ox-drawn carts. This happens especially to those that are from areas that are not easily accessed by cars such as resettlement areas commonly known as \\"minda murefu\\" (literally, \\"long fields\\"). HIV and AIDS Like other rural areas, Shurugwi Rural Areas has suffered the wrath of HIV and AIDS, partly because of unawareness and poverty. Sex is considered the only form of entertainment in rural areas, given that many families do not have televisions and there are no cinemas to watch movies. Due to an unexpected number of deaths between the middle 1990s and the early 2000s, people have been frightened by the consequences of AIDS and the HIV rate in the area has recently declined. Resettlement areas There has been considerable resettlement, since 80% of the area around Shurugwi was owned by commercial farmers (generally Caucasians) who lost their farms because of the domestic land policy of President Mugabe. The people who claimed these farms (mostly black families without land) have struggled to survive due to lack of knowledge regarding good agricultural methods. Most of the beneficiaries are not originally from Shurugwi. Politics Home to the late freedom fighter and Commander in Chief of Zanla forces, Josiah Magama Tongogara, other notable politicians include late Midland governor and resident minister Herbert S.M Mahlaba, Francis Nhema, the Minister of Tourism in the Mugabe cabinet and an MP of Shurugwi, first Shurugwi MP at independence and now Foreign Affairs Minister Dr Simbarashe Mumbengegwi, Dr Lucia Matibenga, and Emmerson Mnangagwa, by virtue of marriage to Tongogara's sister and coming from Chirumhanzu, and Dr Frank Mbengo. Due to patronage, MPs have since independence come from the north (15 km north of Cha Cha Cha Township), an area under the guardianship of Chief Nhema, as opposed to the south which is under Chief Ndanga. David Ruzive, a former MP who has been heavily criticized, was also from Nhema. This has caused more development in the Nhema area than in the Ndanga Area. Cha Cha Cha Township is the best-located township in Shurugwi Rural because it is where major roads meet. Unfortunately it has been neglected and the growth point was placed at Tongogara Township.For the growth of Shurugwi Chachacha must be upgraded for it to get government fundingto provide work for the local community Natural resources The district is located on the mineral-rich belt, commonly known as the Great Dyke in Zimbabwe, known locally as Chironde Mountain range, making it one of the most mineral-rich areas in the country. Chromite,Platinum, Gold and Nickel are all mined around Shurugwi. This mountain range stretches all the way from Cape Town through to the copper belt regions of Zambia. Places of interest include Wolfshall Pass, commonly known as Boterekwa due to the winding of the road as it negotiates its way up and between mountains. Midway through Boterekwa, there is Dun raven Falls which is about 100m from the road. Boterekwa is very similar to the pass close to Louis Trichardt in South Africa since both were constructed by an Italian firm, the difference only being there are tunnels in Louis Trichardt. It has been a scene of many road accidents with most of them fatal. The most notable of these accidents occurred in 1976 when a bus load of students from Chrome Secondary School overturned. Only three teachers survived the crash. Almost every year, a serious accident do occur at Boterekwa, this is attributed to the narrow road, steep slopes and sharp curves. Another place of interest can be the Guruguru (which means very huge) mountain, the mountain is a bare granite rock which a few kilometers east of Pakame High School. Getting to the top of this mountain can be a mission due to the absence of supporting trees and slippery rock surfaces. Generally, Shurugwi is very scenic districts which a sizeable hills all over the place, this include Bokai, Chikomo Chirefu, Magomana, Shamba, Rasha close to Chachacha and Gururuguru. Unfortunately due to resettlement in the area, most of wild animals have been driven away or killed.

Overview Heroes of Annihilated Empires is the first installment of a planned trilogy. The developers cite the Heroes of Might and Magic series and their own Cossacks series as inspirations. The developers describe the game's genre as \\"RTS vs. RPG\\" - the game can be played as an action role-playing game with a solo hero unit or as a traditional base-building real-time strategy game. The game engine uses a 3-D world map with 2-D unit sprites, although larger units and the heroes are fully 3-d models. The small units are sprites to save processing power as there can be upwards of several hundred present in large battles. Heroes of Annihilated Empires features four playable races and twelve neutral races. The game supports up to 7 players via LAN or Internet. Setting The game's setting and storyline were created by Ukrainian novelist Ilya Novak, who received an Encouragement Award at Eurocon 2005. Novak describes the game's genre as \\"epic dark fantasy\\". A series of five novels are planned to support the game; as of November 2006, three have been published in Russia. Plot Gameplay Heroes of Annihilated Empires has four playable races: the Elves (Sylvan Folk), the Undead (Legions of Ashes), the Mechanicians (Dwarves who use machines), and the Cryo Race (barbarians with a specialty in cold magic) also a fifth race is available through a mod from the GSC forum called Sols (Egyptian Fire Magicians). The player can select one of three hero types: Warrior, Ranger, and Mage. When a game begins, the player can cast a spell called \\"Rally Troops\\" to turn the hero into a statue for 30 minutes, and in return gain a few builder units, or sell the spell for 2100 gold coins. If the player sells the spell, the game plays as a role-playing game; otherwise the game plays as a real-time strategy game. On the real-time strategy mode the main focus of involves around base building, resource collection and defeating the opponent. There are also scored games where both players focus on increasing the overall score to achieve victory. The real-time strategy mode allows for battles in ground, water and air levels though naval warfare remains effective only in multiplayer as the AI is unable to build ports and ships. The real-time strategy battles are huge with thousands of units. Many units like Were-Wolves, Vampires etc. are capable of transforming into entirely different units. Were-wolves, for instance, can transform into Archers and Vampires can change themselves into Bats.

It was first performed by the Children of the Revels, one of the troupes of boy actors popular at the time, in the Blackfriars Theatre. The play was entered into the Stationers' Register on 17 March 1606, and published later that year by the bookseller John Windet. The title page of the first edition states that the play was acted at the Blackfriars, with no mention of the company's name ‚Äî which indicates that the play must have been performed in late 1605 or early 1606, after the Queen's Revels Children has lost royal patronage as a result of the Eastward Hoe scandal.Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 433. The play tells the story of the Carthaginian princess, Sophonisba, who is being lustfully pursued by an unwanted suitor, the lecherous and unscrupulous Syphax, despite her having recently married the noble warrior Massinissa. Meanwhile, Carthage is being attacked by the forces of the Roman general Scipio. As Carthage and its king, break faith with Massinissa in an effort to fend off the combined forces of Scipio and a rebuffed Syphax, Sophonisba is forced to choose between filial allegiance to King Hasdrubal and personal fidelity to both her ideals and her husband. Ultimately, Sophonisba commits suicide so that Massinissa will not be forced to break two conflicting vows: to keep his wife free from Roman bondage and to deliver her to Scipio. By upholding Massinissa‚Äôs reputation, at play‚Äôs end, Sophonisba becomes the ‚ÄúWonder of Women‚Äù and the ‚Äújust shame of men.‚Äù The plot is highly sensationalist and melodramatic, and the play features several scenes of high stylization, martial pomp, and ritual. Critics have often been harsh in their appraisals of The Wonder of Women. In his brief introduction to the play, editor H. Harvey Wood even declares that ‚Äú[Marston‚Äôs] style in Sophonisba is almost grotesquely strained and inflated in an attempt to match the dignity of the subject and the import of the occasion‚Äù Wood, Vol.3, p.xii. In the address \\"To the General Reader,\\" prefixed to the print edition of the play, Marston explains that he has written the play as a poetic statement, not a factually accurate history. The play's themes include the difficulty of acting honorably in a corrupt society, and the importance of maintaining personal integrity. Notes References * Caputi, Anthony. John Marston, Satirist.

It was part of the Union Iron Brigade. Service The 24th Michigan Infantry was organized at Detroit, Michigan and mustered into Federal service on August 15, 1862. It was assigned to the famous Iron Brigade in the Army of the Potomac. The brigade's commander General John Gibbon had requested a new regiment be added to his command because its four original regiments (the 2nd, 6th, and 7th Wisconsin and the 19th Indiana) had been severely depleted by combat action and numbered less than 1000 men total by October 1862. He said that ideally it should be a Western regiment since the others were from that part of the country. Gibbon's request granted, the 24th Michigan joined the brigade and saw its first action at Fredericksburg taking on a nuisance battery of Confederate horse artillery south of the town.

Produced by Chip Douglas (who returned to work with the Turtles after a brief stint shepherding The Monkees' transition into a live band), it was released in November 1968 by White Whale Records. It includes John Barbata's final recorded performances with the band; he left shortly after its release to join Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. Barbata's eventual replacement, former Spanky and Our Gang drummer John Seiter, also contributed to the album. Some issues of the album were retitled Elenore. It is a concept album, with the band pretending to be a series of different groups, playing in varying styles from psychedelic (\\"The Last Thing I Remember\\") to R&B; instrumental rock (\\"Buzzsaw\\") to surf music (\\"Surfer Dan\\") to bluegrass (\\"Chicken Little Was Right\\"), competing in a mock Battle of the Bands. The outer cover shows the Turtles in evening dress, playing hosts of the \\"show\\", while the inside gatefold shows them in different costumes for each song. The entire album is filled with puns and hidden jokes. (According to liner notes on various Turtles CDs, White Whale Records was in reality, a one-artist label and they were consistently pressuring The Turtles to come up with another \\"Happy Together,\\" which resulted in \\"Elenore,\\" a humorous reworking of the classic \\"happy pop\\" single.) \\"Kamanawanalea\\" was a made-up Hawaiian idol (\\"the god of lust and perversion\\"), and a rude pun. The lyrics of \\"Food\\" included a recipe for brownies, with a special ingredient. \\"Surfer Dan\\" was billed as being by The Cross Fires, a nod to the Turtles' previous incarnation as a surf-music band known as The Crossfires before it had signed with White Whale Records. \\"You Showed Me\\" was written by Roger McGuinn and Gene Clark of The Byrds, and became the last major Turtles hit. The final song, \\"Earth Anthem,\\" was recorded at 3:00 A.M. by candlelight, to capture the exact mood the Turtles wanted. \\"I'm Chief Kamanawanalea\\" has been sampled in many tracks, such as \\"Say No Go\\" by De La Soul and \\"Jimmy James\\" by the Beastie Boys. It was also used in an episode of the TV show \\"Life on Mars\\" (US version) in a discotheque scene.

The evangelical effort was a major part of, and a justification for, the military conquests of European powers such as Portugal, Spain and France. Christian Missions to the indigenous peoples ran hand-in-hand with the colonial efforts of Catholic nations. In the Americas and other colonies in Asia and Africa, most missions were run by religious orders such as the Franciscans, Dominicans, Augustinians, and Jesuits. In Mexico the early systematic evangelization by mendicants came to be known as the \\"Spiritual Conquest of Mexico\\".Robert Ricard, The Spiritual Conquest of Mexico: An Essay on the Apostolate and the Evangelizing Methods of the Mendicant Orders in New Spain: 1523‚Äì1572, translated from the French by Lesley Bird Simpson. Berkeley: University of California Press 1966. The original text in French, Conqu√™te Spirituelle du Mexique appeared in 1933. Antonio de Montesinos, a Dominican friar on the island of Hispaniola, was the first member of the clergy to publicly denounce all forms of enslavement and oppression of the indigenous peoples of the Americas.Hanke, Lewis. (1946) \\"Free Speech in Sixteenth-Century Spanish America\\". The Hispanic American Historical Review, 26,2:135‚Äì149. Page 142. Theologians such as Francisco de Vitoria and Bartolom√© de las Casas drew up theological and philosophical bases for the defense of the human rights of the colonized native populations, thus creating the basis of international law, regulating the relationships between nations. Important contemporary ecclesiastical documents taking a strong stance on enslaving or despoiling the indigenous peoples of the Americas was the ecclesiastical letter Pastorale officium and the superseding encyclical Sublimis Deus. In the early years most mission work was undertaken by the religious orders. Over time it was intended that a normal church structure would be established in the mission areas. The process began with the formation of special jurisdictions, known as apostolic prefectures and apostolic vicariates. These developing churches eventually graduated to regular diocesan status with the appointment of a local bishop. After decolonization, this process increased in pace as church structures altered to reflect new political-administrative realities. Background La Virgen de Candelaria, Patron of the Canary Islands In 1341, a three-ship expedition sponsored by King Afonso IV of Portugal, set out from Lisbon for the Canary Islands. The expedition spent five months mapping the islands. This expedition became the basis of Portuguese claims to the islands. In 1344, the Castilian-French noble Luis de la Cerda (Count of Clermont and Admiral of France), and French ambassador to the papal court in Avignon, proposed to Pope Clement VI, conquering the islands and converting the native Guanches to Christianity.Viera y Clavijo, p.268 In November 1344, Clement VI issued the bull Tu devonitis sinceritas bestowing upon Luis de la Cerda the title of sovereign \\"Prince of Fortuna\\". Clement also urged the kings of Portugal and Castile to provide assistance to Cerda's expedition.Monumenta Henricina vol. 1 contains copies of Pope Clement VI's bull Tu devonitis sinceritas(Nov 1344) granting the Canaries to Luis de la Cerda (p.207), the bull Prouenit ex tue of indulgences (Jan 1345) p.228 The Portuguese king Afonso IV immediately lodged a protest,For Alfonso IV's protest (Feb 1345), see MH, v. 1,(p.231) as did Alfonso XI of Castile.For the reply of Alfonso XI (Mar 1345) see MH, vol. 1 p.234. Preparations were delayed and no expedition was mounted before Cerda's death in 1348. The raids and attacks of the Reconquista created captives on both sides, who were either ransomed or sold as slaves. During the dynastic wars of the 1370s, between Portugal and Castile, Portuguese and Castilian privateers made for the Canaries for shelter or slaving raids. In 1415, the Portuguese captured the city of Ceuta and continued to expand their control along the coast of Morocco. Portuguese ventures were intended to compete with the Muslim trans-Sahara caravans, which held a monopoly on West African gold and ivory. In 1418 the Portuguese began to settle the Madeira Islands, at first prized for their wood and later cane sugar. By 1427 they had reached the Azores. Portugal and Spain continued to dispute control of the Canary Islands. Age of Discovery Creator omnium The Castilian conquest of the islands began in 1402, with the expedition of Jean de B√©thencourt and Gadifer de la Salle, on commission of Henry III of Castile. The expedition included two Franciscan friars. Lanzarote, and later Fuerteventura and El Hierro were occupied, and the Bishopric of the Canaries was established. In 1434, Prince Henry of Portugal attempted to invade Gran Canaria. When a landing was repulsed by the Guanches, the native Berber inhabitants, the expedition then plundered the Castilian missions on Lanzarote and Fuerteventura. A complaint was lodged by Fernando Calvetos, the Castilian bishop of San Marcial del Rubic√≥n in Lanzarote, supported by the archbishop of Seville. Calvetos informed the pope of the pillaging carried out by the Portuguese \\"pirates\\". Pope Eugene IV issued Regimini gregis on 29 September 1434,MH, V, 89‚Äì93, ¬ß38 and Creator Omnium, on 17 December 1434, forbidding any further raids on the Canaries and ordered the immediate manumission of all Christian converts enslaved during the attack. While Creator omnium was issued in response to Portuguese depredations on Castilian settlements in the Canaries, the following month Pope Eugene issued the broader Sicut Dudum, indicating that Castilian slavers were not exempt and requiring that residents of the Canary Islands who had been enslaved were to be set free within fifteen days of publication of the bull upon penalty of excommunication.Pope Eugene IV, Sicut dudum, 13 January 1435 Papal Encyclicals online Dum diversas According to Stanley G. Payne, \\"[T]he expansion of the faith was inextricably intertwined with military glory and economic profit. Because of this it is idle to ask, as is frequently done, whether the Portuguese pioneers and Castilian conquistadores were motivated more by greed or by religious zeal. In the Hispanic crusading expansionist ideology, the two went together. When Islam presented a serious military threat to Italy and Central Europe during the mid-15th century, Pope Nicholas V tried to unite Christendom against them but failed. He then granted Portugal the right to subdue and even enslave Muslims, pagans and other unbelievers in the papal bull Dum Diversas (1452). The following year saw the Fall of Constantinople to Muslim invaders.Thomas, Hugh, The Slave Trade: The Story of the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1440-1870 (1999), Simon and Schuster, , p. 65-6. Several decades later, European colonizers and missionaries spread Catholicism to the Americas, Asia, Africa and Oceania. Pope Alexander VI had awarded colonial rights over most of the newly discovered lands to Spain and Portugal.Koschorke, Klaus, A History of Christianity in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, 1450‚Äì1990 (2007), Wm B Eerdmans Publishing Co, , p. 13, 283. Under the patronato system, however, state authorities, not the Vatican, controlled all clerical appointments in the new colonies.Dussel, Enrique, A History of the Church in Latin America (1981), Wm. B. Eerdmans, , p. 39, 59. Thus, the 1455 Papal Bull Romanus Pontifex granted the Portuguese all lands behind Cape Bojador and allows to reduce pagans and other enemies of Christ to perpetual slavery. Later, the 1481 Papal Bull Aeterni regis granted all lands south of the Canary Islands to Portugal, while in May 1493 the Spanish-born Pope Alexander VI decreed in the Bull Inter caetera that all lands west of a meridian only 100 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands should belong to Spain while new lands discovered east of that line would belong to Portugal. A further Bull, Dudum siquidem, made some more concessions to Spain, and the pope's arrangements were then amended by the Treaty of Tordesillas of 1494 negotiated between Spain and Portugal. After the discovery of the Americas, many of the clergy sent to the New World began to criticize Spain and the Church's treatment of indigenous peoples. In December 1511, Antonio de Montesinos, a Dominican friar, openly rebuked the Spanish rulers of Hispaniola for their \\"cruelty and tyranny\\" in dealing with the natives.Koschorke, Klaus, A History of Christianity in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, 1450‚Äì1990 (2007), Wm B Eerdmans Publishing Co, , p. 287. King Ferdinand enacted the Laws of Burgos and Valladolid in response. However enforcement was lax, and the New Laws of 1542 took a stronger line. This caused a revolt among the Spanish colonists, and the alarmed government backed down, softening the effect of the laws. Some historians blame the Church for not doing enough to liberate the Indians; others point to the Church as the only voice raised on behalf of indigenous peoples.Dussel, Enrique, A History of the Church in Latin America (1981), Wm. B. Eerdmans, , p. 45, 52, 53 quote: \\"The missionary Church opposed this state of affairs from the beginning, and nearly everything positive that was done for the benefit of the indigenous peoples resulted from the call and clamor of the missionaries. The fact remained, however, that widespread injustice was extremely difficult to uproot ... Even more important than Bartolome de Las Casas was the Bishop of Nicaragua, Antonio de Valdeviso, who ultimately suffered martyrdom for his defense of the Indian.\\" The issue resulted in a crisis of conscience in 16th- century Spain.Johansen, p. 109, 110, quote: \\"In the Americas, the Catholic priest Bartolome de las Casas avidly encouraged inquiries into the Spanish conquest's many cruelties. Las Casas chronicled Spanish brutality against the Native peoples in excruciating detail.\\" The reaction of Catholic writers such as Bartolom√© de Las Casas and Francisco de Vitoria led to debate on the nature of human rights and the birth of modern international law.Woods, Thomas, How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization (2005), Regnery Publishing, Inc, p. 137.Chadwick, Owen, A History of Christianity, Barnes & Noble, (1995), p. 327. (French, English, and Dutch reactions against the maritime monopolies granted to Portugal and Spain, meanwhile, culminated in Hugo Grotius's work articulating the doctrine of freedom of the seas.) In 1524, Franciscan missionaries known as the Twelve Apostles of Mexico arrived in what is New Spain, followed by the Dominicans in 1526, and the Augustinians in 1533.Robert Ricard, The Spiritual Conquest of Mexico: An Essay on the Apostolate and the Evangelizing Methods of the Mendicant Orders in New Spain, 1523-1572, translated by Lesley Byrd Simpson.

Because some people questioned whether the Indians were truly men who deserved baptism, Pope Paul III in the papal bull Veritas Ipsa or Sublimis Deus (1537) confirmed that the Indians were deserving men.Johansen, Bruce, The Native Peoples of North America, Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, 2006, p. 110, quote: \\"In the Papal bull Sublimis deus (1537), Pope Paul III declared that Indians were to be regarded as fully human, and that their souls were as immortal as those of Europeans. This edict also outlawed slavery of Indians in any form...\\"Koschorke, A History of Christianity in Asia, Africa, and Latin America (2007), p. 290 Afterward, the conversion effort gained momentum.Samora et al., A History of the Mexican-American People (1993), p. 20  School of Salamanca  Coste√±o dancers at Mission San Jos√© with their bodies painted to resemble the patterns in Spanish military uniforms.Kelsey, H. (1993). Mission San Juan Capistrano: A Pocket History. Interdisciplinary Research, Inc., Altadena, CA. p. 5 The School of Salamanca, which gathered theologians such as the Dominican Francisco de Vitoria (1480‚Äì1546), and later theologians, such as the highly influential Jesuit Francisco Su√°rez (1548‚Äì1617), argued in favor of the existence of rights to indigenous peoples. For example, these theologians thought that it was illegitimate to conquer other peoples for religious reasons, or even to force the baptisms of non-Christian subjects. Their views on non-believers had been already established by medieval discussions of Jewish and Muslim subjects of Christian princes. Although this view was not always prevalent, it was the traditional Dominican and Thomist view, and reflected the practice of late antiquity and the early Middle Ages. However, while such theologians limited Charles V's imperial powers over colonized people, they also mentioned some legitimate reasons for the conquest. For instance, on their view, war might be justified if the indigenous people refused free transit and commerce to the Europeans; if they forced converts to return to idolatry; if there come to be a sufficient number of Christians in the newly discovered land that they wish to receive from the Pope a Christian government; if the indigenous people lacked just laws, magistrates, agricultural techniques, etc. In any case, title taken according to this principle must be exercised with Christian charity, warned Su√°rez, and for the advantage of the Indians. More traditional theologians legitimized the conquest while at the same time limiting the absolute power of the sovereign, which was celebrated in others parts of Europe under the developing notion of the divine right of kings. Conversions and assimilation The conquest was immediately accompanied by evangelization, and new, local forms of Catholicism appeared. The Virgin of Guadalupe is one of Mexico's oldest religious images, and is said to have appeared to Juan Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin in 1531. News of the 1534 apparition on Tepayac Hill spread quickly through Mexico; and in the seven years that followed, 1532 through 1538, the Indian people accepted the Spaniards and 8 million people were converted to the Catholic faith. Thereafter, the Aztecs no longer practiced human sacrifice or native forms of worship. In 2001 the Italian Movement of Love Saint Juan Diego was created, and launched evangelization projects in 32 states. A year later, Juan Diego was canonized by Pope John Paul II.

Chicago: University of Chicago Press. 1976 Such Virgins appeared in most of the other evangelized countries, mixing Catholicism with the local customs: *The Basilica of Our Lady of Copacabana was built in Bolivia, near the Isla del Sol where the Sun God was believed to be born, in the 16th century, to commemorate the apparition of the Virgin of Copacabana. * In Cuba the Virgin named Caridad del Cobre was allegedly seen in the beginning of the 16th century, a case consigned in the Archivo General de Indias. * In Brazil Our Lady of Aparecida was declared in 1929 official Patron Saint of the country by Pope Pius XI. * Our Lady of Luj√°n in Argentina. * La Negrita in Costa Rica. Religious orders Dominicans Franciscans  Jesuits  The Altar of St. Francis Xavier Parish in Nasugbu, Batangas, Philippines. St. Francis is the principal patron of the town, together with Our Lady of Escalera. The first attempt by Jesuits to reach China was made in 1552 by St. Francis Xavier, Navarrese priest and missionary and founding member of the Society. Xavier, however, died the same year on the Chinese island of Shangchuan, without having reached the mainland. Three decades later, in 1582, led by several figures including the prominent Italian Matteo Ricci, Jesuits once again initiated mission work in China, ultimately introducing Western science, mathematics, astronomy, and visual arts to the imperial court, and carrying on significant inter-cultural and philosophical dialogue with Chinese scholars, particularly representatives of Confucianism. At the time of their peak influence, members of the Jesuit delegation were considered some of the emperor's most valued and trusted advisors, holding numerous prestigious posts in the imperial government. Many Chinese, including notable former Confucian scholars, adopted Christianity and became priests and members of the Society of Jesus. Between the 18th and mid-19th century, nearly all Western missionaries in China were forced to conduct their teaching and other activities covertly. Elsewhere, Jesuit missionary Francis Xavier introduced Christianity to Japan. By the end of the 16th century tens of thousands of Japanese followed Roman Catholicism. Church growth came to a halt in 1635 under the Shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu who, in an effort to isolate the country from foreign influences, launched a severe persecution of Christians.Koschorke, A History of Christianity in Asia, Africa, and Latin America (2007), pp. 31-2 Japanese were forbidden to leave the country and Europeans were forbidden to enter. Despite this, a minority Christian population survived into the 19th century.McManners, Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity (1990), p. 318 Location of the most important Jesuit Reductions in the Southern Cone, with present political divisions. In South America, the Jesuits protected native peoples from enslavement by establishing semi-independent settlements called reductions. Pope Gregory XVI, challenging Spanish and Portuguese sovereignty, appointed his own candidates as bishops in the colonies, condemned slavery and the slave trade in 1839 (papal bull In supremo apostolatus), and approved the ordination of native clergy in spite of government racism.Duffy, Saints and Sinners (1997), p. 221 Many buildings erected by the Jesuits still stand, such as the Cathedral of Saint Paul in Macau and the Sant√≠sima Trinidad de Paran√° in Paraguay, an example of a Jesuit Reduction. Empires and missions Spanish missions In Las Californias Province of New Spain in the Americas, the Catholic Church expanded its missions in cooperation with the Spanish government and military to settle present day California and protect it from Imperial Russian and British colonial advances. Jun√≠pero Serra, the Franciscan priest in charge of this effort, founded a series of mission stations which became economic, political, and religious institutions.Norman, The Roman Catholic Church an Illustrated History (2007), pp. 111-2 These missions brought grain, cattle, and a changed homeland for the California Native Americans. They had no immunity to European diseases, with subsequent indigenous tribal population falls. However, by bringing Western civilization to the area, these missions and the Spanish government have been held responsible for wiping out nearly a third of the native population, primarily through disease.King, Mission to Paradise (1975), p. 169 Overland routes were established from New Spain (Mexico) that resulted in the establishment of a mission and presidio (fort) ‚Äî now San Francisco (1776), and a pueblo (town) ‚Äî now Los Angeles (1781). French missions The French colonial effort began later than that of the Spanish or Portuguese. Hawaii: The French Incident (1839) Under the rule of Kaahumanu the newly converted Protestant widow of Kamehameha the Great, Catholicism was illegal in Hawaii and chiefs loyal to her forcibly deported French priests onto the Artemise. Native Hawaiian Catholic converts were imprisoned and Protestant ministers ordered them to be tortured. The prejudice against the French Catholics missionaries remained the same under the reign of her successor, the Kuhina Nui Ka'ahumanu II. In 1839 Captain Laplace of the French frigate Art√©mise sailed to Hawaii under orders to > destroy the malevolent impression which you find established to the > detriment of the French name; to rectify the erroneous opinion which has > been created as to the power of France; and to make it well understood that > it would be to the advantage of the chiefs of those islands of the Ocean to > conduct themselves in such a manner as not to incur the wrath of France. You > will exact, if necessary with all the force that is yours to use, complete > reparation for the wrongs which have been committed, and you will not quit > those places until you have left in all minds a solid and lasting > impression. Secularization and decolonization Decolonization in Central and South America began with the revolutions in the 1820s, with all countries becoming independent then, except Puerto Rico and Cuba in 1898. Leaders were inspired by the American Revolution and the French Revolution of the late 18th century. Emergence of the American Catholic Church In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the Roman Catholic Church experienced unique difficulties within the United States of America. \\"Unlike all Protestant churches in America, the Roman Catholic church depended for its identity upon keeping doctrinal and administrative unity with a European-based authority.\\"Howard C. Kee et al., Christianity: A Social and Cultural History (2nd Edition), 2 ed. (Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Prentice Hall, 1997), 455. The papacy was cautious of the freedom found in the United States as it showed similarities to the attitudes behind the French Revolution. The papacy wanted to preserve the hierarchy of the church in the United States. At this time, Catholics were chiefly located in Pennsylvania and Maryland and were greatly influenced by their Protestant neighbors. They, too, wanted a church that empowered the laity. In 1788 John Carroll was appointed the first Bishop of the United States. He struggled to balance the desires of the US trustees to adapt and empower the laity and hold church property with the requests of the bishops and hierarchy oversees to preserve the doctrine. This controversy ran from approximately 1780 to 1850. In the end, the power and authority were too differential and the bishops won. This marked the creation of the \\"American Catholic Church with the laity subordinate to priest and bishop\\".Howard C. Kee et al., Christianity: A Social and Cultural History (2nd ed.), Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Prentice Hall, 1997, 456. This system remained until the mid-20th century. Beginnings of the American Catholic school system In the early-to-mid-19th century, schools in the United States were greatly influenced by Protestantism. This created difficulties with American Catholics. They challenged the singing of Protestant hymns and reading of the King James Bible in the classroom. Some school boards made changes to be more non-denominational. Tensions were great during this time period as Americans were already fearful of immigration and Catholics. After a number of struggles, for a variety of reasons, American Catholics began creating their own schools in the 1840s. Archbishop at the time, John Hughes, insisted that Catholic education was the primary way to preserve proper Christian teaching.Mark A. Noll, A Documentary History of Religion in America since 1877, 3rd ed. (Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 2003), 39. He cited education at a young age promoted the reason and experience necessary for a strong religious background. He called American Catholics \\"to multiply our schools, and to perfect them\\".Mark A. Noll, A Documentary History of Religion in America since 1877 (3rd ed.), Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 2003, 42. By 1852 the bishops recommended \\"Catholic children should attend only schools that were under church control\\".Howard C. Kee et al., Christianity: A Social and Cultural History (2nd es.), Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Prentice Hall, 1997, 460.  20th century  countries visited by John Paul II. Sanctuary dedicated to the Difunta Correa, a semi-pagan saint, located in Uruguay, between the Tacuaremb√≥ and Paso de los Toros cities. The Catholic faith also became integrated in the industrial and post-industrial middle class as it developed, in particular through the lay movements created following the 1891 Rerum novarum encyclical enacted by Pope Leo XIII, and which insisted on the social role of the Roman Catholic Church.Jean-Pierre Bastian, \\"Des foules si ferventes\\" in L'Histoire n¬∞322, July‚ÄìAugust 2007, pp.86-89 New ceremonies appeared throughout the 20th century, such as Fidencio Constantino Sintora (known as the Ni√±o Fidencio) (1898‚Äì1938) in Mexico, the Santa Muerte in Mexico (who has been attacked by the Catholic Church as being a pagan figure) or Difunta Correa in Argentina. The latter's pilgrimage site was visited by 700 000 persons in 2005. Legacy and issues 20th-century missions Much Catholic missionary work has undergone a profound change since the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì1965), and has become explicitly conscious of the dangers of cultural imperialism or economic exploitation. Contemporary Christian missionaries try to observe the principles of inculturation in their missionary work. In the 1970s, the Jesuits would become a main proponent of the liberation theology which openly supported anti-imperialist movements. It was officially condemned in 1984 and in 1986 by then-Cardinal Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) as the head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, under charges of Marxist tendencies, while Leonardo Boff was suspended. Proselytism has continued however throughout the 20th century, with Latin America accounting for the largest Catholic population in the world. But since the 1960s, Protestant evangelism and new religious movements have begun to strongly compete with Catholicism in South America, while various approaches to evangelism have been developed. In response, Pope John Paul II made frequent travels to this continent, visiting among other countries Chile during Pinochet's rule. He also supported Catholic Charismatic Renewal movements against rival Charismatic movements, and groups such as the Neocatechumenal Way (which has close to 20,000 communities in Latin America and 600,000 members alone), Focolari, Comunione e Liberazione or the Opus Dei, which are main vectors of Roman Catholicism in the region.Fran√ßois Normand, \\"La troublante ascension de l'Opus Dei\\", Le Monde diplomatique, September 1995 In the 1990 encyclical Redemptoris Missio (subtitled On the permanent validity of the Church's missionary mandate), John Paul II stressed \\"the urgency of missionary activity\\"Introduction of Redemptoris Missio, 1. and in which he wished \\"to invite the Church to renew her missionary commitment\\".Introduction of Redemptoris Missio, 2.  Ethnocide and challenges  After a journey among the Bari in South America, the ethnologist Robert Jaulin called for a convention on ethnocide in the Americas at the Congress of Americanists, and, in February 1970, the French Society of Americanists convened for that purpose. Jaulin criticized in particular the role of Christian missionaries towards non-Western cultures.  Pope Francis positions  On August 9, 2019, Pope argued that isolationism and populism lead to war and stated that \\"the whole is greater than the parts. Globalization and unity should not be conceived as a sphere, but as a polyhedron: each people retains its identity in unity with others. While 'sovereignism' involves closing in upon oneself, sovereignty is not, the Pope argued. The Pope stated that sovereignty must be defended and relations with other countries, with the European Community, must also be protected and promoted.\\" This will be addressed as part of Synod on the Amazonia, which involves land in South America that was explored during the Age of Discovery.

This is an instrumental album in which Joseph wrote and conducted all of the scores. In addition to incorporating a core band including violinist Charlie Bisharat and drummer Charlie Adams, he used a 50-piece orchestra. It is an \\"expression of a life's work and dreams\\", featuring intimate piano pieces, quartets and full orchestrations, \\"combining smooth jazz with contemporary instrumental themes\\". It reached New Age Voice (NAV)'s \\"Airwaves Top 30\\" at No. 15 in July 1997. History During his years of worldwide concert tours as keyboardist with Yanni and Sheena Easton, Bradley Joseph released his debut album, Hear the Masses in 1994. Subsequently, Joseph attracted the attention of Narada Productions via the World Wide Web. A representative for Narada came across Joseph's website and downloaded some music. This sparked their interest and resulted in signing Joseph to a multi-record deal. The outcome was Rapture, Joseph's second album, which was recorded at a number of different studios including Captain and Tennille's studio in Los Angeles and Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. In addition to using a core band including Charlie Adams on percussion, Charlie Bisharat on violin and Steven Trochlil on clarinet, Joseph brought in a 50-piece orchestra and conducted and wrote all the scores. Michael Debbage of Wind and Wire magazine recalls, \\"It was the year 1997 and New Age music had already peaked commercially as the interest and exposure seemed to lag. The genres main labels ‚Äì Narada, Windham Music, and Higher Octave ‚Äì were beginning to explore worldly themes versus the warm, earthly, acoustic themes that prior artists had established. It appeared that the abundance of new artists was becoming a dying breed. An exception to the rule was Bradley Joseph, who released his first mainstream album Rapture to glorious reviews, and to this day it remains his tour de force.\\" Joseph used the Yamaha and B√∂sendorfer pianos for this album. He often references the past when he names his songs and his music is frequently reminiscent of his rural Minnesota roots. His company, Robbins Island Music, [and song] is named after a city park in Willmar, says Anne Polta of the West Central Tribune. Critical reception Ken Moore of the Naples Daily News cites, \\"Joseph's music is backed by 15 talented musicians, some playing three or more different instruments that make up a symphony of sounds ranging from quietly pensive mood music to a rich orchestration of classical depth and breadth.\\" It contains \\"...heavy flowing strings and emotion-filled keyboard melodies, as on 'A Lover's Return'\\", states the Johnson County Sun, while Ross Boissoneau of Allmusic contradicts saying, \\"...Joseph has a good ear for melody, but he pretty much refrains from Yanni's trademark sweeping, whooshing synth swells.\\" A review of Rapture from New Age Voice states, \\"Joseph is smooth, painting romantic pictures in sound with voices and instruments that escalate from quiet, intimate passages to big, energetic movements. The arrangements are structured so that the trumpet can lead a line out on 'Be Still' signaling an introspective sort of mood. Yet the strings swell on 'The Passage', engulfing the listener in an ocean of sound. Even cuts that start quiet, such as 'Healing the Hollow Man' or 'Blue Rock Road' ebb and flow between quiet moments and crescendos.\\" John Blake of The Atlanta Journal notes that often New Age music sounds as if it should be played in a supermarket. The songs can sound like musical cotton candy ‚Äî soft, airy and ultimately uninteresting. \\"For the most part, Bradley's music doesn't make that mistake.\\" \\"The music is cinematic, filled with introspective piano solos, swelling violins, and a hypnotic song pacing that allows the listener to daydream.\\" Track listing #\\"A Lover's Return\\" ‚Äì 4:08 #\\"Feel\\" ‚Äì 4:32 #\\"Jewel\\" ‚Äì 4:26 #\\"Healing the Hollow Man\\" ‚Äì 4:12 #\\"Blue Rock Road\\" ‚Äì 3:13 #\\"Robbins Island\\" ‚Äì 3:54 #\\"Stray\\" ‚Äì 6:05 #\\"A Stolen Kiss\\" ‚Äì 4:08 #\\"The Gallery\\" ‚Äì 4:30 #\\"Be Still\\" ‚Äì 2:52 #\\"Coastal Highway\\" ‚Äì 3:14 #\\"Storyteller\\" ‚Äì 4:56 #\\"The Passage\\" ‚Äì 4:18 Personnel *All songs composed, arranged, and produced by Bradley Joseph. *Bradley Joseph ‚Äì keyboards, vocals *Charlie Adams, Marc Anderson ‚Äì percussion *James Anton ‚Äì electric bass *Gordy Johnson ‚Äì string bass *Daniel Neale, Aron \\"Pumpkin\\" Trooien ‚Äì guitar *James Wheeler ‚Äì drums *David Levin, Clystie Whang ‚Äì vocals *Charlie Bisharat ‚Äì solo violin *Terry Brau ‚Äì bass clarinet, trumpet *Melissa Hasin ‚Äì solo cello *Brian Pearson ‚Äì flute, trumpet *Jennifer Schumacher ‚Äì English horn, oboe *Steven P.

Corry, Jr. (1889‚Äì1920), a naval aviator who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. Corry was launched on 28 July 1945 by Consolidated Steel Corp. of Texas, Orange, Texas; sponsored by Miss Corry; commissioned on 27 February 1946, Commander M. S. Shellabarger in command; and reported to the Atlantic Fleet.  Service history Corry sailed from Galveston, Texas, on 28 March 1946 for shakedown training in the Caribbean Sea, and arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 10 July. Following a tour of duty in European waters and the Mediterranean Sea from 23 July 1946 to 19 March 1947, Corry conducted Reserve training cruises from the Potomac River Naval Command, then reported to Pensacola, Florida, to serve as plane guard for aircraft carriers operating off Florida from 22 September 1947 to 28 April 1950. Corry joined Destroyer Squadron 8 (DesRon 8) at Norfolk 22 May 1950 for antisubmarine exercises which included a cruise to Quebec in July. From 2 September to 12 November she served with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean, and joined a midshipman cruise to northern Europe, visiting Gotesburg and Cherbourg, France, from 1 June to 27 July 1951. Her next tour of duty with the 6th Fleet was from 22 April to 23 October 1952. Corry sailed out of Norfolk for local operations until 1 April 1953 when she was decommissioned for conversion to a radar picket destroyer. She was reclassified DDR-817, 9 April 1953. Recommissioned 9 January 1954, Corry carried NROTC midshipmen on a cruise to New Orleans, Louisiana, and through the Panama Canal for operations at Balboa in the summer of 1954. From September 1954 through 1960 Corry alternated four tours of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean with operations out of Norfolk along the east coast, and exercises in the Caribbean.

Its purpose was to profoundly modify the structure of some areas of the 13th arrondissement, mainly around the Avenue d'Italie which inspired its name. The partially completed project led to the creation of numerous towers in the south of the arrondissement, notably Les Olympiades.  Origins of the project  Olympiades behind the last remaining structure of Panhard factories. The Italie 13 project was one of the answers proposed by urbanists to the insalubrity of some areas of the city, mainly the 13th arrondissement which was generally considered to be \\"badly built.\\" Raymond Lopez, the advising architect at the Paris city hall, and his assistant Michel Holley, considered this renovation to be an opportunity to completely reorganize those areas, in the spirit of the Athens charter and Le Corbusier. This meant that new construction should be tall in order to liberate more space at the ground level and to bring a better luminosity to apartments, and separating heavily traveled roads from smaller local roads and pedestrian areas. Other principles from Le Corbusier, such as surrounding towers with parks were, however, put aside. The guiding plan of urbanism (\\"Plan d'urbanisme directeur\\") written in 1959 and applied in 1961, concisely summarizes that new conception of the city: \\"urban layout should not be defined anymore by streets, but actually by built-up structures, which should themselves be guided by functional considerations\\". The Olympiades district is a perfect illustration of this program. Thanks to strong political support following the creation of the Fifth Republic in 1958, the Italie 13 project began quickly. The city council approved it in 1966 and charged the private sector with completing it. The project operated on a territory of 87 hectares between Place d'Italie, and Paris's outlying boulevards. Its ambition was to build 16,400 accommodations, and 150,000 m¬≤ of commercial and business space. It also included the construction of new schools and gardens. Towers were supposed to be approximately the same height, about 30 floors. Holley felt that towers should respect the principle of height unity according to Parisian traditions.  Results  The main buildings resulting from Italie 13 are found in three main areas, with scattered isolated buildings. View on the three main areas of towers from the Tour Super-Italie. Les Olympiades  The Olympiades project, directly managed by Michel Holley from 1969 to 1974, is the only project (along with the Front de Seine district (located in the 15th arrondissement)) to fully respect the objectives of the guiding plan of urbanism: * towers and groundscrapers are displayed along an approximate North-South axis independently of street layout. * some streets, exclusively dedicated to functional use, are invisible as they are built under the huge elevated esplanade in the middle of the district. * The esplanade is exclusively dedicated to the pedestrians, while the surrounding avenues concentrate all the car traffic. Shops are built on the esplanade, along with the main entrances of the towers. Towers of the district are named after cities which had hosted the Olympic Games: Ath√®nes (Athens), Sapporo, Helsinki, Tokyo and others. Nowadays, the district, costly to maintain, is part of a new renovation project in the context of a grand projet de renouvellement urbain (large project of urban renewal).  Nearby Place d'Italie  M. Novarina), Antoine et Cl√©op√¢tre (M. Holley) and the four towers of the centre Galaxie. The Avenue d'Italie was slated to be enlarged to the dimensions of the Champs-Elys√©es and become an expressway. Pedestrians and local traffic were supposed to cross the avenue with bridges and tunnels. This part of the project has been abandoned. Near Place d'Italie, Michel Holley has drawn the tower Antoine et Cl√©op√¢tre, one of the few not to be strictly parallelepiped-shaped. On the other side of the avenue, four towers and one groundscraper named after precious or semi-precious stones (Onyx, Beryl, Jade, Ruby) have been erected around a private garden built on the roof of the Italie 2 shopping mall (itself formerly known as Galaxie). An esplanade was supposed to cover the Avenue d'Italie, something which has finally been abandoned. It is one of the rare spots where the Avenue d'Italie has been enlarged to 70 meters, as planned by the Italie 13 project. The most ambitious part of the project was the tour Apog√©e: similar in height to the Tour Montparnasse, it was supposed to be the landmark indicating the entrance of the district. Proposed with different design by Michel Holley during the 1970s, its height successively decreased before finally the cancellation of its construction. In 1980, the French government had to pay 470 million francs to the promoter as compensation for this cancellation.  The Mass√©na district  This district is built on the former location of Panhard factories between Porte d'Ivry and the rue Gandon. It encompasses from East to West: * Villa d'Este, where the concentration of towers is undoubtedly the highest inside the city of Paris. * The shopping mall of Mass√©na 13. * The district of the Porte de Choisy. Towers in that district are directly displayed at the street level and as such are better integrated in the Paris urban layout. They are named after Italian cities or composers: Puccini, Palerme, Rimini, among others.  Other constructions  There are also some isolated buildings and projects: * near Porte d'Italie: the Tour Super-Italie, the only cylindrical tower in the district, and the tour Chambord built on the . * On the : several scattered highrise buildings including the three towers of Cheops, Chephren and Mykerinos, thus named because their shape is slightly pyramidal, and one of the most original towers in Paris: * The Tour du Nouveau-Monde, whose entire exterior is decorated with bas-reliefs.  The end of Italie 13 and the return to a more traditional conception of the city  As the towers were being successively erected, public criticism grew increasingly harsh, a view which was later shared by professionals and politicians. In 1974, the new French president Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing, decided to stop the Italie 13 project. The brutalist design of the towers, formerly seen as revolutionary progress, failed, for some, to promote a positive image of the 13th arrondissement. This is especially true since, being built on a hill, they are more visible than other projects such as the Front de Seine towers. The bland aspect of those buildings has massively damaged the image of towers, in general, among Parisians. Inhabitants of the towers are themselves more ambivalent. Their judgement depends widely on the building they live in. Indeed, while the exterior aspect of those towers is very similar, their layouts, amenities and general standing vary enormously from one to another. Moreover, the operating costs of these buildings are very expensive compared to more traditional Hausmanian buildings. They were designed with affluent buyers in mind, but at this time, affluent buyers thought that these were too far from the west of Paris where they worked. Most of them failed to sell out and were soon filled with Asian refugees who found available housing. Sometimes, up to 4 families crowded some apartment space, and for many of them paying the operating costs and rent was a problem. In the meantime, Parisians started to leave the city center and its apartments to buy individual houses in the suburbs, leaving some towers in dire conditions. Nevertheless, the Olympiades esplanade has maintained a rather important business and commercial role, something which is not true in other projects in Paris and its suburbs. The arrival of the Asian community at the end of the 1970s has brought an important and growing vitality to this area. In recent years, the area is undergoing (like most of Paris city center) quick gentrification. Most towers have undergone renovation works, and are now up to the latest security norms, urban renewal is taking place below the towers at street level with help from the municipality. (Works on Olympiades and Place de V√©n√©tie is underway, Villa d'Este should follow soon). As a result, real estate prices in this particular neighborhood is up steadily even if it is still a cheap neighborhood compared to other places in Paris. The high quality of the buildings which were created for affluent people means that flats are comfortable, have a nice unobstructed view and a lot of light (which is a rare luxury in Paris). As a result, some more affluent people are starting to consider again this habitat. Because of the critical reception of this project, urbanism in France, especially in the city of Paris, has followed a much more modest direction. The Paris Rive Gauche project, located a few hundred meters from the Olympiades, is the only large-scale urbanism project inside the city of Paris to be built since Italie 13. However, the dense nature and lack of space in the highly built-up city may also play a role. The Paris Rive Gauche project is an example of more traditional urbanism based on the alignment of mid-rise buildings in concert with the existing street layout. While urbanism of the 1960s and 1970s was based on the idea of returning to the past, today's urbanism is based on the idea of promoting Paris' heritage. This philosophy is less common in Paris's inner suburbs, where large-scale projects, mostly business developments, have multiplied since the 1990s.

As with the movements in Germany and the Netherlands, Swedish anarchism had a strong syndicalist tendency. One of the earliest Swedish anarchists of note was the artist Ivan Agu√©li who in 1884 was arrested and sentenced in the \\"Trial of the thirty\\" in Paris. Also prominent were Anton Nilson, Leon Larsson, Axel Holmstr√∂m, Albert Jensen, and Hinke Bergegren. Bergegren edited and published nine issues of the weekly periodical Under r√∂d flagg, from March to June 1891. The magazine, which had an anarchist communist editorial bent, featured excerpts from the writings of prominent European anarchist intellectuals Peter Kropotkin, Leo Tolstoy, and √âlis√©e Reclus. Anarchist ideas were prominent in the Swedish Social Democratic Party from its founding in 1889 to the early 1900s. Bergegren headed the party's anarchist group ‚Äì called Ungsocialisterna (The Young Socialists). Bergegren and Ungsocialisterna were expelled from the SDP between 1906 and 1908. The Invisible Party was a decentralized campaign founded by different parts of the Swedish extra-parliamentary left, in particular the Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation. The purpose was to highlight the real politics going on in the workplaces and in the streets, as compared with the parliamentary politics of the Riksdagen.

Guilds and organizations play a major role in the Synnibarr 'Worldship'. Mortals are often able to interact with immortals, demi-gods and even the gods themselves. System Most rolls are of percentile dice (d100) though some are additive while others use a roll-under mechanic. The third edition game mechanic replaces the previous percentile system with a streamlined skill- based system, where resolve and experience create cogency levels that are pitted against opposing cogency levels for determining results. McCracken and a group of other people have been playing and developing Synnibarr since the mid 90s. In December 2012 a Kickstarter was launched to publish a new edition. The project was expected to span three books, an \\"Ultimate Adventurer's Guide\\", a \\"Worldship Atlas\\", and a \\"Book of Fate\\". The \\"Ultimate Adventurer's Guide\\" was published in August 2018, but as of December 2019 backers had received neither books nor updates for some time. Reception Some consider it a bad example of a role playing game.

Britain had held an amical protectorate over the islands since the 1815 Treaty of Paris. The federated United States of the Ionian Islands included seven islands off the coasts of Epirus and the Peloponnese, that had remained in Venetian hands until 1797 and escaped Ottoman rule. Of the seven, six lay in the Ionian Sea, off the western coast of the Greek mainland. These six states were Corf√π (Kerkyra), Ithaca, Pax√≤, Cephalonia, Zante (Zakynthos) and Santa Maura (Lefkas). Cerigo (Kythera) was also a state of the federation, although it is situated southeast of the Peloponnese. Ever since Greece had become independent from the Ottoman Empire in 1832, the people of the Ionian islands had resented foreign rule. At a Cabinet meeting in 1862, British Foreign Secretary Palmerston decided to cede the islands to Greece. This policy was also favoured by Queen Victoria. The practical reasoning was that maintenance of ownership in the area was too expensive. Besides, the islands did not have great strategic importance; Britain would still maintain a strategic presence in the Mediterranean from the island of Malta. The decision to cede the islands was also influenced by the accession to the Greek throne of the Danish prince George, a committed Anglophile. Indeed, in a referendum in November 1862, the Greeks had elected Queen Victoria's second son, Prince Alfred, as their King, partly in the hope of receiving the Ionian Islands. After long negotiations with Greece, the Treaty of London was signed by Greek delegate Charilaos Trikoupis on 29 March 1864. On 2 May 1864 the British departed and the Ionian Islands became three provinces of the Kingdom of Greece, although Britain retained use of the port on Corfu. This can be seen as the first example of voluntary decolonization by Britain. See also *Treaties of London Further reading * Anderson M. S.

The sort criteria do not have to be included in the result set. The sort criteria can be expressions, including column names, user-defined functions, arithmetic operations, or \`CASE\` expressions. The expressions are evaluated and the results are used for the sorting, i.e., the values stored in the column or the results of the function call. \`ORDER BY\` is the only way to sort the rows in the result set. Without this clause, the relational database system may return the rows in any order. If an ordering is required, the \`ORDER BY\` must be provided in the \`SELECT\` statement sent by the application. Although some database systems allow the specification of an \`ORDER BY\` clause in subselects or view definitions, the presence there has no effect. A view is a logical relational table, and the relational model mandates that a table is a set of rows, implying no sort order whatsoever. The only exception are constructs like \`ORDER BY ORDER OF ...\` (not standardized in SQL:2003) which allow the propagation of sort criteria through nested subselects. The SQL standard's core functionality does not explicitly define a default sort order for Nulls. With the SQL:2003 extension T611, \\"Elementary OLAP operations\\", nulls can be sorted before or after all data values by using the \`NULLS FIRST\` or \`NULLS LAST\` clauses of the \`ORDER BY\` list, respectively.

He was one of several early buccaneers to attack Campeche, looting the settlement in 1633, and was active against the Spanish in the Spanish Main and throughout the Caribbean during the 1630s and 40s. Jol was really more of a pirate (or rather privateer) than an admiral, raiding Spanish and Portuguese fleets and gathering large amounts of loot. He was nicknamed Houtebeen (Perna de Pau in Portuguese and Pie de Palo in Spanish), because he lost a leg during battle and became one of the earliest documented pirates to use a wooden peg leg. The Spanish also nicknamed him El Pirata. Biography \\"Before the Battle of the Downs\\" by Reinier Nooms, ca. 1639. Cornelis Jol commanded a squadron of seven ships in this naval battle. Cornelis Jol hailed from the fishing borough of Scheveningen, administratively a part of The Hague. He joined the Dutch West India Company in 1626 and quickly climbed the ranks to become admiral. He was a popular commander among the Dutch, with contemporary chroniclers commending his \\"courage and prudence, his integrity, resoluteness and tenacity of purpose.\\" Jol crossed the Atlantic Ocean nine times to attack the Spanish and Portuguese along the coast of Brazil and in the Caribbean. During one of his earliest voyages, he captured the island of Fernando de Noronha off the coast of Brazil,Southey, Roberto. Historia do Brasil. Rio de Janeiro: Livraria De B.L. Garnier, 1862. (pg. 184) which remained a part of Dutch Brazil until 1654 under the name of Pavonia. In 1633, he and Diego el Mulato attacked Campeche in the Yucat√°n Peninsula, then held by Spain, with a fleet of ten ships. In 1635 he was captured near Dunkirk by Dunkirk privateers but released some 6 months after. With victory came fame, and demonisation by the Spanish upon whom he preyed. While attempting to capture the Spanish treasure fleet in 1638, he engaged in a naval battle with Spanish admiral Don Carlos Ibarra off the coast of Cuba. None of the treasure ships were captured however, as his captains refused to fight out of envy for Jol's promotion to admiral before them. In Spain, he was falsely reported to have been killed in the confrontation. He also commanded a squadron of seven ships at the Battle of the Downs under admiral Maarten Tromp, a decisive defeat of the Spanish, in 1639. In 1640, while awaiting the Spanish treasure fleet again off Havana, Cuba, his fleet was caught in a hurricane and four of the ships were wrecked on the shore. Also in 1640, Jol set out from Brazil for the coast of Africa, where he took the city of Luanda (in Angola) and the island of S√£o Tom√© from the Portuguese. While on S√£o Tom√©, he was struck by malaria and died on 31 October 1641. His son, also called Cornelis Corneliszoon Jol (or Hola), pursued a career at sea as well and served as an officer in the Dutch navy. He was captain of the Leiden, also under admiral Maarten Tromp during the First Anglo-Dutch War (1652‚Äì1654). A street in Scheveningen is named for Jol.

The town was most likely founded between 600 and 700 AD. It was a municipality along with the village of Middelrode until a large-scale municipal reorganisation in 1996, when Berlicum and neighbouring Den Dungen merged with the municipality of Sint-Michielsgestel. In 2009, Berlicum had 9,743 inhabitants. History The historic town centre is 'Raadhuisplein' (town hall square), on the northwestern edge of the town. The square is dominated by the neoclassical former town hall, known as 'De Plaets' (1845). Another notably building at the square is former mayor's mansion at number 18, with its distinctly white facade. Behind the former town hall is the Protestant 'Samen-op-Weg' church, a national monument dating back to the 14th century. The building was originally a Roman Catholic church under the care of priests from the nearby norbertine Berne Abbey. It became a Protestant church in 1648, when the region became part of the Dutch Republic after the Peace of Westphalia. Under the peace treaty, Catholics were allowed to exercise their religion in private. A clandestine church was built in 1676. In 1837, this church was replaced by a neogotical church building. Funding was provided by a government programme to compensate the loss of historically catholic church buildings during the Reformation period. The new church, named after Saint Peter ('R.K. Sint-Petruskerk') and located at Kerkwijk 44, was subsequently enlarged several times. Both churches were heavily damaged during Operation Market Garden at the end of the Second World War, along with many other historic buildings in Berlicum, but were restored after the war. The new Saint Peter's church was substantially smaller than its predecessor and was provided with a traditionalist facade. An additional catholic church in neoromanesque style was built in the nearby village of Middelrode. Modern town After the Second World War, Berlicum became a commuter town. In the 1970s a modern shopping centre, 'Mercuriusplein' square, was created in the geographical heart of the town. Most of the retail stores, two supermarkets and a weekly food market are located here. On the northern side of the square is the new town hall, established in 1982 and in use until the municipal reorganisation in 1996. The building was then transformed into apartments and stores. In the face of secularization and rising maintenance costs, the diocese of 's-Hertogenbosch decided to close the church of Saint Peter in 2012. Catholic religious services are now provided at the Sacraments church in Middelrode. Transportation The N279 highway along the Zuid-Willemsvaart canal connects the town with the two major commercial and industrial hubs in the region: 's-Hertogenbosch to the northwest and Veghel to the southeast. Regular public transport between these cities is provided by Arriva bus line 158, which has multiple stops in Berlicum.

During this period, European interests in Africa primarily focused on the establishment of trading posts there, particularly for the African slave trade. The wave ended with British annexation of Kingdom of Kandy in 1815 and founding of colony of Singapore in 1819. The time period in which much of the first wave of European colonization (and other exploratory ventures) occurred is often labeled the Age of Discovery. A later major phase of European colonization, which started in the late 19th-century and primarily focused on Africa and Asia, is known as the period of New Imperialism. The Role of the Church  Religious zeal played a large role in Spanish and Portuguese overseas activities. While the Pope himself was a political power to be heeded (as evidenced by his authority to decree whole continents open to colonization by particular kings), the Church also sent missionaries to convert the indigenous peoples of other continents to the Catholic faith. Thus, the 1455 Papal Bull Romanus Pontifex granted the Portuguese all lands behind Cape Bojador and allowed them to reduce pagans and other enemies of Christ to perpetual slavery. Later, the 1481 Papal Bull Aeterni regis granted all lands south of the Canary Islands to Portugal, while in May 1493 the Spanish-born Pope Alexander VI decreed in the Bull Inter caetera that all lands west of a meridian only 100 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands should belong to Spain while new lands discovered east of that line would belong to Portugal. These arrangements were later precised with the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas. The Dominicans and Jesuits, notably Francis Xavier in Asia, were particularly active in this endeavour. Many buildings erected by the Jesuits still stand, such as the Cathedral of Saint Paul in Macau and the Santisima Trinidad de Paran√° in Paraguay, an example of a Jesuit Reduction. Spanish treatment of the indigenous populations provoked a fierce debate at home in 1550‚Äì51, dubbed the Valladolid debate, over whether Indians possessed souls and if so, whether they were entitled to the basic rights of mankind. Bartolom√© de Las Casas, author of A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, championed the cause of the natives, and was opposed by Sep√∫lveda, who claimed Amerindians were \\"natural slaves\\". The School of Salamanca, which gathered theologians such as Francisco de Vitoria (1480‚Äì1546) or Francisco Su√°rez (1548‚Äì1617), argued in favor of the existence of natural law, which thus gave some rights to indigenous people. However, while the School of Salamanca limited Charles V's imperial powers over colonized people, they also legitimized the conquest, defining the conditions of \\"Just War\\". For example, these theologians admitted the existence of the right for indigenous people to reject religious conversion, which was a novelty for Western philosophical thought. However, Su√°rez also conceived many particular cases -- a casuistry -- in which conquest was legitimized. Hence, war was justified if the indigenous people refused free transit and commerce to the Europeans; if they forced converts to return to idolatry; if there come to be a sufficient number of Christians in the newly discovered land that they wish to receive from the Pope a Christian government; if the indigenous people lacked just laws, magistrates, agricultural techniques, etc. In any case, title taken according to this principle must be exercised with Christian charity, warned Su√°rez, and for the advantage of the Indians. Henceforth, the School of Salamanca legitimized the conquest while at the same time limiting the absolute power of the sovereign, which was celebrated in others parts of Europe under the notion of the divine right of kings. In the 1970s, the Jesuits would become a main proponent of the Liberation theology which openly supported anti-imperialist movements. It was officially condemned in 1984 and in 1986 by then Cardinal Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) as the head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, under charges of Marxist tendencies, while Leonardo Boff was suspended. Northern European challenges to Iberian hegemony It was not long before the exclusivity of Iberian claims to the Americas was challenged by other European powers, primarily the Netherlands, France and England: the view taken by the rulers of these nations is epitomized by the quotation attributed to Francis I of France demanding to be shown the clause in Adam's will excluding his authority from the New World. This challenge initially took the form of privateering raids (such as that led by Francis Drake) on Spanish treasure fleets or coastal settlements, but later, Northern European countries began establishing settlements of their own, primarily in areas that were outside of Spanish interests, such as what is now the eastern seaboard of the United States and Canada, or islands in the Caribbean, such as Aruba, Martinique and Barbados, that had been abandoned by the Spanish in favour of the mainland and larger islands. Whereas Spanish colonialism was based on the religious conversion and exploitation of local populations via encomiendas (many Spaniards emigrated to the Americas to elevate their social status, and were not interested in manual labour), Northern European colonialism was frequently bolstered by people fleeing religious persecution or intolerance (for example, the Mayflower voyage). The motive for emigration was not to become an aristocrat nor to spread one's faith but to start afresh in a new society, where life would be hard but one would be free to exercise one's religious beliefs. The most populous emigration of the 17th century was that of the English, and after a series of wars with the Dutch and the French the English overseas possessions came to dominate the east coast of North America, an area stretching from Virginia northwards to New England and Newfoundland, although during the 17th century an even greater number of English emigrants settled in the West Indies. However, the English, French and Dutch were no more averse to making a profit than the Spanish and Portuguese, and whilst their areas of settlement in the Americas proved to be devoid of the precious metals found by the Spanish, trade in other commodities and products that could be sold at massive profit in Europe provided another reason for crossing the Atlantic, in particular furs from Canada, tobacco and cotton grown in Virginia and sugar in the islands of the Caribbean and Brazil. Due to the massive depletion of indigenous labour, plantation owners had to look elsewhere for manpower for these labour-intensive crops. They turned to the centuries-old slave trade of west Africa and began transporting humans across the Atlantic on a massive scale ‚Äì historians estimate that the Atlantic slave trade brought between 10 and 12 million individuals to the New World. The islands of the Caribbean soon came to be populated by slaves of African descent, ruled over by a white minority of plantation owners interested in making a fortune and then returning to their home country to spend it. Rule in the colonies: the Leyes de Burgos and the Code Noir  The January 27, 1512 Leyes de Burgos codified the government of the indigenous people of the New World, since the common law of Spain wasn't applied in these recently discovered territories. The scope of the laws were originally restricted to the island of Hispaniola, but were later extended to Puerto Rico and Jamaica. They authorized and legalized the colonial practice of creating encomiendas, where Indians were grouped together to work under colonial masters, limiting the size of these establishments to a minimum of 40 and a maximum of 150 people. The document finally prohibited the use of any form of punishment by the encomenderos, reserving it for officials established in each town for the implementation of the laws. It also ordered that the Indians undergo catechism, outlawed bigamy, and required that the huts and cabins of the Indians be built together with those of the Spanish. It respected, in some ways, the traditional authorities, granting chiefs exemptions from ordinary jobs and granting them various Indians as servants. The poor fulfilment of the laws in many cases lead to innumerable protests and claims. This would create momentum for reform, carried out through the Leyes Nuevas (\\"New Laws\\") in 1542. Ten years later, Dominican friar Bartolom√© de las Casas would publish A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, in the midst of the Valladolid Controversy. In the French empire, slave trade and other colonial rules were regulated by Louis XIV's 1689 Code Noir. Role of companies in early colonialism  From its very outset, Western colonialism was operated as a joint public-private venture. Columbus' voyages to the Americas were partially funded by Italian investors, but whereas the Spanish state maintained a tight rein on trade with its colonies (by law, the colonies could only trade with one designated port in the mother country and treasure was brought back in special convoys), the English, French and Dutch granted what were effectively trade monopolies to joint-stock companies such as the East India Companies and the Hudson's Bay Company. The Massachusetts Bay Company, founded in 1628/9, swiftly established a form of self-governance following the Cambridge Agreement of August 1629, whereby subsequent meetings of the board of governors took place in Massachusetts itself.  European colonies in India during the first wave of colonization  In 1498, the Portuguese arrived in Goa. Rivalry among reigning European powers saw the entry of the Dutch, British, French, Danish among others. The fractured debilitated kingdoms of India were gradually taken over by the Europeans and indirectly controlled by puppet rulers. In 1600, Queen Elizabeth I accorded a charter, forming the East India Company to trade with India and eastern Asia. The British landed in India in Surat in 1624. By the 19th century, they had assumed direct and indirect control over most of India.  Destruction of the Amerindian population  The arrival of the conquistadores caused the annihilation of most of the Amerindians. However, contemporary historians now generally reject the Black Legend according to which the brutality of the European colonists accounted for most of the deaths. It is now generally believed that diseases, such as the smallpox, brought upon by the Columbian Exchange, were the greatest destroyer, although the brutality of the conquest itself isn't contested. Genocidal policies were more common in post-colonial states, notably in 19th century United States and Argentina where indigenous populations were systematically exterminated. For example, Juan Manuel de Rosas, Argentinian caudillo from 1829 to 1852, openly pursued the extermination of the local population, an event related by Darwin in The Voyage of the Beagle (1839). He was then followed by the \\"Conquest of the Desert\\" in the 1870‚Äì80s. The result was the death of a large amount of the Mapuche population in Patagonia. After the Amerindians' quasi-total disparition, the mines and the sugar cane plantations thus led to the booming of the Atlantic slave trade, especially apparent in the Caribbean where the largest ethnic group is of African descent. Contemporary historians debate the legitimacy of calling the quasi-disparition of the Amerindians a \\"genocide\\". Estimates of pre-Columbian population have ranged from a low of 8.4 million to a high of 112.5 million persons; in 1976, geographer William Denevan derived a \\"consensus count\\" of about 54 million people.20th century estimates in Thornton, Russell. American Indian Holocaust and Survival: A Population History Since 1492. University of Oklahoma Press, 1987. , p. 22; Denevan's consensus count; recent lower estimates David Stannard has argued that \\"The destruction of the Indians of the Americas was, far and away, the most massive act of genocide in the history of the world\\", with almost 100 million Amerindians killed in what he calls the American Holocaust. Like Ward Churchill, he believes that the American natives were deliberately and systematically exterminated over the course of several centuries, and that the process continues to the present day.Stannard, David E. American Holocaust: The Conquest of the New World. Oxford University Press, 1993. ; p. x (quotation), p. 151 (death toll estimate). Stannard's claim of 100 million deaths has been disputed because he makes no distinction between death from violence and death from disease. In response, political scientist R. J. Rummel has instead estimated that over the centuries of European colonization about 2 million to 15 million American indigenous people were the victims of what he calls democide. \\"Even if these figures are remotely true\\", writes Rummel, \\"then this still make this subjugation of the Americas one of the bloodier, centuries long, democides in world history.\\" Cf. R. J. Rummel's quote and estimate from his website, about midway down the page, after footnote 82. Rummel's estimate is presumably not a single democide, but a total of multiple democides, since there were many different governments involved.  Economic pursuit and treatment of slaves  Spain and Portugal sought the utilization of foreign and indigenous peoples during post colonial contact with the New World. The Portuguese and Spanish use of slavery in Latin America was seen as a lucrative business which ultimately led to internal and external development in gaining economic influence at any cost. The economic pursuits of the Spanish and Portuguese empires ushered in the era of the Atlantic Slave Trade. In the fifteenth century, Portugal shifted its attention to the latter economic endeavor. Their ships sailed from the borders of the Sahara desert to the entirety of the West African coast.Newson, Linda A., and Susie Minchin. From Capture to Sale the Portuguese Slave Trade to Spanish South America in the Early Seventeenth Century. Leiden: Brill, 2007. At the outset of the Atlantic Slave Trade, Manuel Bautista P√©rez, a notable Portuguese-born Marrano Jewish slave trader, gives insight to the amount and treatment of the African slaves. P√©rez and his men conducted slave trading in which thousands of African peoples were bought from local tribal leaders and transported across the Atlantic to South America. In contrast from popular belief, Portuguese slave traders did not acquire slaves in a forceful manner. According to documents written by Manuel P√©rez, slaves were only made available by certain conditions. The most notable condition was bartering ‚Äúitems that the leaders wanted and were interested in‚Äù. Items such as bread, coal, precious stones, and firearms were provided in exchange for slaves. Furthermore, local tribal leaders did not simply give up their own people for the aforementioned commodities but rather through intertribal wars, debts, and civil crime offenders. Labor in the Spanish and Portuguese colonies became scarce. European diseases and forced labor began killing the indigenous people in insurmountable numbers. Therefore, slaves were seen only as a business venture due to the labor shortages. These slaves were forced to work in jobs such as agriculture and mining. According to David Eltis, areas controlled by the Spanish such as Mexico, Peru, and large parts of Central America used forced slave labor in \\"mining activities\\".Eltis, David. Economic Growth and the Ending of the Transatlantic Slave Trade. New York: Oxford University Press, 1987. p. 31. In 1494 the Pope ushered in the Treaty of Tordesillas, granting Spain and Portugal two separate parts of the world.Sider, Sandra. Handbook to Life in Renaissance Europe. New York: Facts On File, 2005. p. 195 Due to this treaty, Portugal had the monopoly on acquiring the slaves from Africa. However, Spain, like Portugal, needed the labor force to pursue their personal economic gains. This gave Portugal an increased revenue stream. African slaves were sold to the Spanish colonies through an internal reform known as the asiento; which gave the right, by the Spanish Crown, for acquiring African slaves from the Portuguese traders. In terms of the treatment of slaves, Portuguese external policies on the acquisition of slaves depict a malicious attempt to obtaining economic wealth. Nearly 3,600 slaves a year were traded by a single trader. This latter statement illuminates that traders tried to get as many slaves as they could in the shortest amount of time. Consequently, this led to the deaths of thousands of African peoples. Newly bought slaves were kept tightly packed in highly flammable huts in order to wait for transport. Once aboard the ships many hundreds of people would once again be shoved into lower ship compartments, collectively chained up, and given little to eat. By these actions \\"nearly a quarter of the slaves transported died before ever reaching the destination\\". Many of them suffocated in the lower compartments as the hatches upon the deck remained closed; restricting the circulation of air. Slaves were often branded with a mark upon their skin to identify either the ship they arrived on or the company that purchased them. In addition, the slaves were seen as a \\"potentially economic utility\\"; therefore they were often equated to cattle when moved about.Postma, Johannes. The Dutch in the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1600‚Äì1815. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990. p. 227. Many African people died in large numbers in order to meet the demand for Spanish and Portuguese labor requirements. Both Spain and Portugal share a similar history in regards to the treatment of slaves in their colonies. As time progressed and new generations of slaves lived under imperial rule, Spanish and Portuguese internal reforms dealt with African slaves in areas such as, \\"the purchasing and selling of slaves, legal ownership, succession upon death of owner, the rights of slaves to buy their liberty, and penalties to those who ran away\\".Mellafe, Rolando. Negro Slavery in Latin America. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1975. p. 101 There was a constant strict social control amongst the slave population. Nevertheless, the goal was to create and sustain a labor force that would yield maximum economic output. The lucrative business the Portuguese sought on the West African coast ushered in an era in which human labor, at any cost, was used for the extraction of wealth.

Allam converted from Islam to Christianity during the Vatican's 2008 Easter vigil service presided over by Pope Benedict XVI. He also serves as a regional councillor in the Italian region of Basilicata after being elected in 2010 and a Member of the European Parliament for Italy since 2009.  Biography  Allam was born in Egypt and raised by Muslim parents. His mother Safeya Allam was a believing and practicing Muslim, whereas his father Muhammad Allam was \\"completely secular and agreed with the [until the early seventies widely held] opinion of the majority of Egyptians who took the West as a model in regard to individual freedom, social customs and cultural and artistic fashions.\\" At age four, his mother entrusted him to the care of Sister Lavinia of the Comboni Missionary Sisters, and later he was sent to a Catholic boarding school in Egypt - the Institute of Don Bosco - for junior high and high school.  Early years in Egypt  Allam describes growing up in a vibrant and multicultural Cairo. He recounts vividly the \\"fragrances, sounds, colors and flavors of his beloved Aunt Adreya's home\\" and remembers Cairo as a \\"colorful, pluralistic and tolerant city where girls wore miniskirts and boys sported Beatles haircuts.\\" He has positive memories of Egyptian society during his childhood years, characterizing it as having a \\"social fabric that embodied a genuine love of others and a simple life where emotion was more important than money.\\" However, an unpleasant incident occurred when he was detained and interrogated at age 15 by the Mukhabarat, or political police, on suspicion of espionage for Israel, because of his relationship with a Jewish girl. Allam's sympathy for the plight of the girl and her family might have displeased the authorities. He claims the trauma of that interrogation accompanied him until Christmas Eve 1972 when he left Egypt to continue his studies in Italy.  Immigration to Italy  In 1972 he moved to Italy and enrolled in La Sapienza University of Rome. He graduated from La Sapienza with a degree in sociology and in 1986 became an Italian citizen.  Journalistic career  Allam began his journalistic career at the communist newspaper Il Manifesto. In 1978, he moved to the center-left leaning Italian newspaper La Repubblica, where he worked as a commentator, mostly writing about issues faced by extra-communitarian immigrants in Italy, especially those originating from North-Africa, and supporting progressive policies on the immigration issue and on the compatibility of Islam and Western values. In 2003, following a radical shift in his views, Magdi Cristiano Allam joined the more conservative, Milan-based Corriere della Sera, one of Italy's oldest and largest daily newspaper, as vice-director ad personam.  Conversion  On March 23, 2008, Magdi Cristiano Allam was offered the baptism during the Vatican's 2008 Easter Vigil service in St. Peter's Basilica presided over by Pope Benedict XVI, consequently Allam converted to Roman Catholicism, in a widely publicized and televised baptism ceremony (see #External links) as usual on every Easter Vigil service. In a 2,000-word letter to the editor of his newspaper, Paolo Mieli, Allam explained his motives for converting to Catholicism. He thanked his mother for sending him to Catholic schools, where he was able to \\"know Catholicism well and up close and the women and men who dedicated their life to serve God in the womb of the Church.\\" He pointed out that in his youth he had become familiar with Catholic writings (\\"Already then I read the Bible and the Gospels and I was especially fascinated by the human and divine figure of Jesus.\\") He credited the Pope as the most influential person in his decision to convert, and, using Christian theological terminology, described his conversion as a mystical experience: > The miracle of Christ's Resurrection reverberated through my soul, > liberating it from the darkness in which the preaching of hatred and > intolerance in the face of the \\"different,\\" uncritically condemned as > \\"enemy,\\" were privileged over love and respect of \\"neighbor.\\"\\" Announcing his support for proselytizing among Muslims, he wrote: > Well, today Benedict XVI, with his witness, tells us that we must overcome > fear and not be afraid to affirm the truth of Jesus even with Muslims. He added on Italian TV that he felt \\"great joy\\" after his conversion.  Response to conversion  Magdi Cristiano Allam's conversion was criticized both by Muslim associations and by progressive Catholics. The Holy See, despite the baptism of Allam, persisted in Christian-Muslim dialogue and distanced itself from several of Allam's political views: \\"On Thursday the Vatican tried to distance Pope Benedict from the baptized journalist's political views who was known for his sallies against Islam in Italy. The Union of Islamic Communities in Italy ‚Äî which Allam has frequently criticized as an organization that incites violence ‚Äî slighted his baptism as \\"his own decision\\". The group's spokesperson, Issedin El Zir, said: > He is an adult, free to make his personal choice. Imam Yahya , vice president of the Italian Islamic Religious Community (Comunit√† Religiosa Islamica Italiana, Co. Re.Is.), said he acknowledged Allam's choice but said he was amusingly \\"perplexed\\" by the symbolic and high- profile way in which Allam chose to convert. Imam Pallavicini explained: > If Allam truly was compelled by a strong spiritual inspiration, perhaps it > would have been better to do it delicately, maybe with a priest from Viterbo > where he lives. The Spanish daily El Pa√≠s criticized Allam's opinions and wondered whether Allam's conversion deserves so much attention: > This intellectual doesn't mince his words when it comes to flaying Islam. > And he is not entirely wrong when he refers to terrorist fanaticism and the > lack of freedom in countries where Islam is professed. He is probably > however going a bit far when he says that the 'root of evil is an inherent > part of Islam, which is physiologically violent'. It is not the Muslim world > as a whole that defends violence or seeks to impose its religion by force. > We shouldn't however play down the courage that Magdi Allam has shown by > daring to say such things that way and we also have to recognise his right > to convert to Christianity. We can nonetheless ask whether it was necessary > for his baptism to have been carried out by the Pope himself in the Vatican. Some criticized the publicity given to the conversion, thus questioning his sincerity and even suggesting a politically motivated apostasy.  Abandonment of the Catholic Church  On 25 March 2013, he publicly announced his abandonment of the Catholic Church to protest its \\"soft stance against Islam\\". Allam said he would remain a Christian but that he didn't \\"believe in the church anymore.\\"  Political career: MEP  He joined politics in 2009, being elected as a Member of the European Parliament (in June 2009) with the center-right Christian-democrat Italian party UDC. He also founded a personal movement called \\"Io Amo L'Italia\\" (I love Italy).magdiallam.it , Retrieved 2013-09-07 However, as a Member of the European Parliament he is still a member of the UDC delegation in the EP (EPP party group).  Opinion and stances   Early progressive views (1978-2003)  During most of his journalistic career (roughly from 1978 to 2003), Allam worked at the center-left leaning and moderate La Repubblica. As he was often employed as a Middle East envoy, most of his articles were reportage more than commentaries, characterized by a neutral tone and argumentative style, and his personal views were rarely reported. His own stances were nevertheless made public via a forum on La Repubblica and in numerous interviews and appearances on talk shows.  On the compatibility between Islam and the West  For a long time, he maintained the position that Islam was compatible with Western civilization and values and he tried to build and believe in a progressive, moderate and liberal Islam. In a meeting with high school students broadcast on Italian public television RAI, he declared: > Islam itself is not a menace, it does not coincide with conservatism, as a > religion is not incompatible with progress and freedom; absolutely not! > Islam is a faith which, in a moderate interpretation, is absolutely > compatible with the values shared by the Italian civil society and the > Italian Constitution. Furthermore, he scorned the idea that Muslims were somehow \\"invading\\" Italy: > There are many Islam (...). The largest majority of Muslims are moderate, > many Muslims are secular (...) according to the numbers provided by the > Muslim organizations in Italy, no more than 3 to 5% of Muslims in Italy even > go to the mosque (...) and then there is a fundamentalist Islam that > believes in an Islamization of the society that would conjugate religion to > politics, and then also a radical Islam, which believes that Islam should be > imposed via violent means. But this is an absolutely irrelevant fringe, > quantified in Italy around circa 3 to 4% of the Muslims, and - let's > remember it - there are overall only 600,000 Muslims in Italy. 600,000 in a > country of 57 millions. Clearly to talk of a risk of Muslim invasion or of a > Muslim menace does not make any sense.  Against fears of immigration  Similarly, he maintained for years that immigration was beneficial for Italy, offsetting population decline and correcting what he called \\"Italy's provincial identity\\": > Economically Italy needs immigrants. Socially Italy needs immigrants to > offset the lowest fertility index of Europe (...). But (stopping > immigration) would also be a catastrophe for Italy as a civilization, > because the immigrant is a bridge that allows Italy to escape a very > provincial sense of identity into a more global one(...). Immigration is a > resource, not a problem . But Allam also argues that all hosting countries must demand respect for its rules and regulations. He firmly believes in an immigration based on \\"Non solo diritti, ma anche doveri\\" (not only rights, but duties as well), reciprocal respect for a better society of social enrichment.  Against the \\"Clash of civilizations\\" theory  After the 9/11 attacks he commented against the clash of civilizations theory, and denounced the idea of a monolithic Islam, intrinsically extremist at its core and naturally driven to expansionism and extremism (a thesis he would come to embrace a few months later): > There will be a clash of civilization? This thesis is based on the idea of > Islam as a monolithic reality, with an integristic identity, and an > inescapable inclination toward expansionism. In reality both Islam as a > faith and Muslims as individuals are to be understood as a plurality. Yet > there is a risk of a clash on ideological basis, should the Muslims > perceived to be attacked indiscriminately by the West (...) It would be a > big gift to Bin Laden.  Later conservative views (2003-Today)  Before converting to Christianity, Magdi Cristiano Allam was raised as a Muslim. He made the pilgrimage to Mecca, with his deeply religious mother in 1991. In his autobiography Vincere la paura (Conquering Fear), Cristiano Allam acknowledges thinking about conversion to Christianity on moving to Italy. Starting from the end of 2002, Allam gradually assumed virtually opposite opinions on most issues related to Islamic world and Middle-East. He accused Italy and the West of ignoring the dangers of an imminent \\"Islamization\\" of the society, and a possible Jihad in Europe. His themes and styles parallel those of the famous Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci. Both authors would extensively refer very positively to each other in their writings. For example, Allam refers many times to Fallaci in his I love Italy, but do Italians Love her? and fully agrees with her positions on these issues. His newfound explicit style has been described by his lifelong friend and noted Italian-Jewish intellectual Gad Lerner as \\"Pharaonic Sturm und Drang\\" and as having \\"fideistic emphasis.\\"  Opposition to multiculturalism  In his writings since 2003, Allam has stated his denunciations of multiculturalism, lashing out at what he calls \\"the Islamization of society.\\" For example, reacting to a speech by Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams which raised the suggestion that Muslims in Britain should be allowed to have their own courts in matters of family law, Allam wrote that > By leaning on the 'politically correct' and by allowing Muslims to have > their own courts, a mixture is installed that can unbalance the country and > overthrow constitutional order. Previously having been a believer in multiculturalism, he now claimed that multiculturalism is dangerous and wrote against \\"submitting ourselves to different ideologies and faiths.\\"  Criticism of Islam  In his public letter to the editor of Corriere della Sera about his conversion, Allam stated that Islam was inseparable from Islamic extremism. Criticising Islam itself, rather than Islamic extremism, Allam argued: > I asked myself how it was possible that those who, like me, sincerely and > boldly called for a 'moderate Islam,' assuming the responsibility of > exposing themselves in the first person in denouncing Islamic extremism and > terrorism, ended up being sentenced to death in the name of Islam on the > basis of the Qur'an. I was forced to see that, beyond the contingency of the > phenomenon of Islamic extremism and terrorism that has appeared on a global > level, the root of evil is inherent in an Islam that is physiologically > violent and historically conflictive.  Ban on mosque building  In 2005, Allam published an article calling for a ban on building mosques in Italy.Moschee-mania, serve uno stop (\\"Mosque- mania needs stopped\\"), Corriere della Sera, September 29, 2005 In a piece accusing mosques of fostering hate, he claimed Italy is suffering from \\"mosque-mania\\" and justified the extreme measure of a government ban on building mosques.  Support of Israel  The change allowed him to become a staunch supporter of Israel, argue against the formula \\"territories for peace\\" which he had championed for more than 25 years. His unwavering support for Israel, he claims, is because the \\"origin of the ideology of hatred, violence and death is the discrimination against Israel.\\" For most of his life he had been a strong albeit argumentative supporter of the Palestinian cause, going to rallies and writing favorably of the Palestinian rights to statehood. However, since 2002, Allam has voiced support of Israel, together with a strong condemnation of Palestinian terrorism. He claims that his criticism of Palestinian terrorism prompted Hamas to allegedly single him out for elimination. According to Italian and Egyptian secret services, Hamas and Egyptian terrorists Islamist groups has claimed responsibility for such a threat. Therefore, in 2003, the Italian government provided him with a sizable security detail.  Support for Israeli military action against Iran  On the issue of Iran's nuclear quest, Magdi Cristiano Allam has said Israel should do whatever it takes to stop Iran's nuclear program, indirectly suggesting that Israel should bomb Iranian nuclear facilities. Labeling the Iranian government \\"the Nazi-Islamic\\" regime, Allam claimed that Israel cannot rely on the United Nations and should not have any illusions about the Bush administration \\"which now wants only to leave Iraq without losing face.\\"  Unauthorized email controversy  On January 16, 2007, in an article entitled Poligamia, la moglie che accusa il capo UCOII (literally: \\"Polygamy, the wife who accuses UCOII's leader\\") on Corriere della Sera, Magdi Allam published an e-mail ‚Äî obtained from a third party‚Äîsent to Hamza Roberto Piccardo, spokesman of the Unione delle Comunit√† ed Organizzazioni Islamiche in Italia, by Piccardo's recently divorced wife, without asking for the authorization of either ex-spouse. In spite of the uproar that followed,See the links to reactions about Magdi Allam's article collected in Dalla parte di Lia 7 on the blog Gattostanco on January 20, 2007 and for instance Luca Conti's Pubblicare email private e l'etica del giornalismo on Pandemia, January 16, 2007 RCS Quotidiani S.p. A, the publisher of Corriere della Sera, chose to keep the article online until the \\"Garante per la protezione dei dati personali\\" (Guarantor for the protection of personal data) ordered RCS to take it down on May 24, 2007.See the Sentence of the Guarantor and its announcement in the Guarantor's Newsletter N. 293 dated July 26, 2007  Criticism  Italian writer Valerio Evangelisti has nicknamed him \\"Pinocchio d'Egitto\\" (Egyptian Pinocchio). In a review of Allam's 2002 book on Saddam Hussein (\\"Saddam: Secret History of a Dictator\\"), he points to the absence of a real bibliography, and to the ridiculously-poor quality of the sources. He pokes fun at the fact that the only cited reference for the entire second chapter is an article from popular Italian tabloid Gente, titled \\"I slept with Saddam for thirty years\\": > Allam is the author of essays of relevant scientific value, no doubt. The > last one is titled \\"Saddam, a dictator's secret history\\" (...) . The book > reads with ever increasing bewilderment (...). Three chapters out of seven > are based on a single tabloid article(...). Never had I seen the tabloid > Gente been used as a source for a historical/sociological analysis. I guess > we are witnessing a revolution in the methodology of social sciences. Allam has many enthusiastic supporters among his newly found readership, and politically in the anti-immigration party he once detested - the Lega Nord, and among the Catholic side of leading Italian party Forza Italia and its electorate: indeed his Godfather was Maurizio Lupi, an elected representative of Forza Italia with well-known connections in the Vatican establishment. Vittorio Zucconi, deputy director of La Repubblica - the newspaper for which Allam had worked for more than 20 years - humorously compared his new pose of \\"defender of the West\\" to American actress Doris Day. Asked by a reader to comment on Allam's quite sudden change of opinions and recent controversial role, Zucconi answered: > I know Magdi all too well, and I love him too much (I swear) to break with > him my resolution of never criticizing a fellow journalist. But your > question Sir reminds me of a famous joke about Doris Day, the blond, chaste, > dolled-up actress of the 60's: \\"I knew Doris before she became a virgin.\\"  Published works  * Viva Israele (Long Live Israel), Mondadori, 2007, * Io amo l'Italia.

Terence Allcock (born 10 December 1935) is a former professional footballer who played for Bolton Wanderers and Norwich City. He was also a first-class cricketer. Bolton Wanderers Allcock was born in Leeds and began his football career with Bolton Wanderers, who approached him while he was captain of Yorkshire schoolboys. When interviewed in 2004 for the book 'Twelve Canary Greats', Allcock stated that his decision to sign for Bolton was made when his Father's job moved to Blackpool and Bolton permitted him to commute from there. He made his first team debut in October 1953 against Manchester City and scored twice in the first twenty minutes. Despite his good start, Allcock was unable to secure a regular first team spot at Burnden Park because he was competing against internationals Nat Lofthouse, Willie Moir and Harold Hassall for a place in the side. He signed for Norwich shortly before the transfer deadline in March 1958. Norwich City In his first full season at Carrow Road, Norwich had one of the most famous FA Cup runs of all time when they reached the semi-finals as a third division side. Allcock scored against Tottenham Hotspur in the tie at White Hart Lane. He went on to play 389 games for Norwich, with his final appearance coming against Blackburn Rovers at Carrow Road on 23 April 1969. His 127 goals for the club place him second on City's all time goalscoring list, just five goals behind Johnny Gavin. Allcock spent most of his career as a forward, but his last five seasons with Norwich were spent playing at half-back. If he had continued to play as a forward, he would almost certainly have beaten Gavin's record. Allcock also has the record of scoring 37 goals in a calendar season, the highest achieved in any calendar season by a Norwich City player. Cricket Allcock also played cricket as a wicket-keeper for Norfolk, appearing for the county in the Minor Counties Championship from 1959 to 1975. His appearances were infrequent, with him playing a total of 36 matches in the competition for Norfolk. He made his List A debut in the 1965 Gillette Cup against Hampshire. In this match Allcock caught-behind Hampshire captain Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie, while with the bat he made 21 runs before being dismissed by Butch White. He made a further List A appearance in the 1968 Gillette Cup against Cheshire. He scored 4 runs in the match, before being dismissed by Gerry Hardstaff. After playing Allcock stayed at Norwich as a coach until 1973 before a brief coaching stint at Manchester City. He is now a matchday host at Carrow Road and in 2002 was made an inaugural member of the Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame. Allcock currently is a partner in the family funeral business.

After a conviction for libel the same year, Beamish fled Britain and began a career of touring speaker, travelling to Germany, Canada, the United States or Japan in order to promote antisemitic and fascist causes. In 1923, he spoke at one of Adolf Hitler's meetings in Munich, and met Julius Streicher in Nuremberg in 1937. Beamish settled in South Rhodesia in 1938, where he served as an independent MP between 1938 and 1940, then was interned for three years during World War II due to his pro-Nazi sentiments. Upon his release, Beamish returned to England and died in March 1948, aged 74.  Biography  Early life and education Henry Hamilton Beamish was born on 2 June 1873, the fifth son of Blanche Georgina Hughes (1840‚Äì1904) and Rear- Admiral Henry Hamilton Beamish (1829‚Äì1911), a former A.D.C. to Queen Victoria. His birth was registered at the civil parish of St George, Hanover Square in London. Beamish's father came from a prosperous family of Irish landowners, although their wealth had already melted away by the time of his parents' birth. His mother was the grand-daughter of Loftus William Otway; the Otway family possessed Castle Otway in County Tipperary, Ireland. Beamish's brother, Rear-Admiral Tufton Beamish (1874‚Äì1951), served as a Conservative MP for Lewes in 1924‚Äì1931 and 1936‚Äì1945. Beamish attended Romanoff House Boys' School in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, then left home at 16. In the UK 1891 Census, he appears as a 17-year-old agricultural student at the Colonial College in Hollesley, in Suffolk.  Canada, Ceylon and South Africa  In 1891 Beamish became a fur trader in Quebec, and he is reported as a participant in an expedition to the North Pole in 1892. He moved to Ceylon in 1895 to work on tea plantations. Between 1898 and 1899, Beamish served as an assistant manager on the Hope Estate in Upper Hewaheta, then as a second lieutenant with the Ceylon Planters Rifle Corps during the Second Boer War (1899‚Äì1902), leaving Ceylon for South Africa in April 1900. He returned to Ceylon two years later in July 1902. Beamish then settled in Bloemfontein, South Africa, where he ran a company named Empire Tea Rooms along with a friend. In 1904 he started one of the country's first agricultural newspapers, the Farmer's Advocate, which he ran for 15 years. In 1907 Beamish represented the Orange River Colony settlers at a London conference with the British government and he met in 1908 with Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe ‚Äì then the secretary of state for the colonies ‚Äì to promote the interests of South African settlers. Beamish founded in 1914 the British Citizen Movement (BCM), an anti-German organisation which campaigned for the purchase of British products to support the war effort; he then became involved with the Consumers' Alliance, which advocated for the exclusion of Germans from business in South Africa. During the First World War, Beamish served in the Natal Regiment of South African Infantry. Thereafter, he moved back to England, convinced from his experiences in Africa of having \\"discovered\\" a world-wide Jewish conspiracy theory. Antisemitic activism in Britain Upon returning to London, Beamish ran as an independent candidate in the 1918 Clapham by-election, pledging to \\"support the Premier in ousting the Hun and making Germany pay for the War\\". He polled 43%,The Times, 22 June 1918 losing against a government candidate by 1,181 votes. In December 1918 Beamish ran again as a parliamentary candidate for the National Federation of Discharged Sailors and Soldiers, coming out second by 6,706 votes. He became involved with the Vigilante League led by Noel Pemberton Billing. After a split within the League, he and Dr J. H. Clarke founded The Britons in 1919 as an orgzanisation specifically set up for the diffusion of antisemitic propaganda. Beamish also befriended Lieutenant-Commander Harry M. Frazer, the founder of the Silver Badge Party. In a deliberate provocation conceived to draw public attention, Beamish and Frazer produced a poster in March 1919 denouncing British-Jewish politician Sir Alfred Mond, then the First Commissioner of Works, as a traitor to his country. This resulted in a libel suit filed by Mond, who was successfully awarded ¬£5000 by a court. Beamish fled Britain to South Africa in order to escape the payment. After that event, Beamish rarely returned to Britain and travelled the world to preach anti-Semitism. Although he remained nominally president of The Britons until his death in 1947, Beamish subsequently participated little in the activities of the organisation, apart from two spectacular reappearances in 1923 and 1932.  Self-exile  Beamish settled in Rhodesia in 1920, then he travelled to Germany in 1923 where he addressed one of Hitler's meetings at the Circus Krone on January 18, with a speech delivered in English and translated by Dietrich Eckart. He has claimed, rather dubiously, to have taught Adolf Hitler. Beamish served as vice-president of the Imperial Fascist League. In 1932 he addressed a meeting of the New Party alongside Arnold Leese on the subject of \\"The Blindness of British Politics under the Jew Money- Power\\". Beamish had otherwise little involvement with the initiatives of Oswald Mosley. Described by a judge in South Africa in 1934 as an \\"anti-Jewish fanatic\\", he travelled to the US in 1935, acting as a \\"transatlantic go- between for pro-Nazi Jew-hatred\\". In 1936 Beamish returned to England and became involved with the Nordic League, an antisemitic organisation founded with German assistance one year earlier. In September 1936 Beamish visited Japan, then spoke at a meeting of the Canadian Nationalist Party in Winnipeg in October, before embarking in December on a major lecture tour of Nazi Germany as a guest of Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop. He met fellow fanatical anti-Semite Julius Streicher in Nuremberg in January 1937. In September 1937, he attended an international antisemitic congress organised by Ulrich Fleischhauer. Beamish also spoke at meetings in North America with Canadian fascist leader Adrien Arcand, including some hosted by the German American Bund.  Later life and death  Beamish returned to Southern Rhodesia in 1938. He became an independent Member of Parliament in August 1938 following a by-election, but lost his seat in the April 1939 election. From June 1940, he was interned for his pro-Nazi sentiments. Upon his release in July 1943, Beamish moved to a farm near Salisbury in England. By then, he had distanced himself from The Britons, whom he accused in a letter wrote two months before his death of departing from the \\"sole purpose\\" of the organisation, that is \\"exposing the Jewish Menace\\". Beamish died on 27 March 1948.  Views  Beamish was one of the earliest proponents of the Madagascar Plan for the Jewish Question. In the early 1920s he proclaimed that \\"Bolshevism was Judaism.\\"James Webb (1976): Occult Establishment: The Dawn of the New Age and The Occult Establishment, (Open Court Publishing), p. 130, References Bibliography : : : : : : : Category:1873 births Category:1948 deaths Category:Antisemitism in England Category:British Army personnel of the Second Boer War Category:English fascists Category:English anti-communists Category:Rhodesian anti-communists Category:Rhodesian politicians ","title":"Henry Hamilton Beamish"},{"id":"7080613","text":"Paul Koech (25 June 1969 ‚Äì 3 September 2018) was a Kenyan distance and marathon runner.

It operated in the areas of energy, water, waste and transport. In 2009 it was integrated into the London Development Agency.

The London Climate Change Agency plans to create a similar system for London. As of 2006, London produces 7% of the UK's carbon emissions.

He was raised in Brownsville, Brooklyn,HipHopDX - Records with Nas, Puff Daddy and currently heads a production company for emerging artists and producers. Production work/involvement Sharif \\"Reefa\\" Slater has produced for Lil Wayne, Estelle, The Game, Rick Ross, Troy Ave, Maino,Rap Radar - Reefa Track for Maino and Mack Wilds Fabolous, Ludacris, Juelz Santana, French Montana, Gucci Mane, Omarion, Beanie Sigel, Red Cafe, Super Junior and The Notorious B.I.G. One of his most successful singles to date has been \\"It's Okay (One Blood)\\" by The Game, and he has been a producer on the two Billboard #1 albums released by Miami Rapper, Rick Ross,SOHH - Record with Rick Ross namely \\"God Forgives, I Don't\\", and \\"Mastermind.XXL Magazine - Mastermind Producers\\" Early career Hailing from Brownsville, Brooklyn, he became interested in music - one of his uncles lived on the same block as Biggie Smalls, and he saw first hand how producers like Diddy and The Trackmasters translated their studio skills into lucrative careers. He began discjockeying at local reggae parties, and moved on to producing rap instrumentals. His first beat placement was for rapper Shells ‚Äì on a song that was included on the Coach Carter film soundtrack. Almost two years passed after he sold that track without anything really happening in his career. Things eventually got moving again through Puffy's Biggie Duets project. He produced the \\"Hustler's Story\\" song featuring Akon and Scarface, and Diddy immediately noticed he had a prize pupil on his hands. After that, the work started rolling in, and Reefa could finally start calling himself a bona fide producer. The real breakthrough in his career came via Dr. Dre's legendary West coast outfit. During a brief visit to LA, he happened to play the \\"One Blood\\" instrumental for Aftermath A&R;, Angelo Sanders. Hours later, he got a call informing him he'd scored the first single to The Game's highly anticipated sophomore album. Recent activity: late 2000s to present Over the last five years, Reefa has clocked heavy studio time with the new titans on the hip hop scene - French Montana, Troy Ave, Chinx Drugz, Maino and the reigning hip hop heavyweight, Rick Ross. Recently, he produced three cuts of French Montana's 2013 Excuse My French album released via Puff Daddy's Bad Boy label. He also crafted critically lauded tracks for the last two Rick Ross albums, God Forgives I Don't (released in 2012) and Mastermind (released in early 2014). Both Rick Ross albums debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 Charts. The track he produced for Rick Ross's 2012 album was a soulful, percussion-heavy banger called \\"Ice Cold\\" featuring R&B; star Omarion. His contribution to Ross's most recent LP was a gritty, hard-hitting NYC-style track called \\"What A Shame\\" featuring French Montana. In 2014, Reefa enjoyed great success on the Billboard top 200 Chart. He notched production credits on two albums that debuted in the Billboard Top 10 in the same week. The first was the aforementioned Mastermind album by Rick Ross, and the second was the comeback album Braveheart from R&B; princess Ashanti. Both albums were released on March 4, 2014. Still to come in 2014, Reefa co-produced with Irv Gotti, Myles William and 12Keyz, a remake of the Notorious B.I.G. song \\"Mo Money Mo Problems\\" for \\"The Other Woman\\" soundtrack movie starring Cameron Diaz, Kate Upton and Nicki Minaj. The song features vocals by both Iggy Azalea and Keyshia Cole.The YBF Iggy Azalea - Keyshia Cole - Reefa In addition to that, he also secured the impressive job of scoring all the music for the upcoming season of T.I.'s VH1 reality show T.I. & Tiny: The Family Hustle.AllHipHop.com - Producer Feature\\" Reefa Production Company: ATM (Addicted to Money) Similar to prolific music production houses like Berry Gordy's Motown and Puff Daddy's hugely successful Hitmen, Reefa is looking to make a lasting impact with his company ATM.

During the 1971‚Äì72 campaign, in which Norwich gained promotion to the First Division for the first time, Anderson featured outside of his regular position in the centre of defence in the absence of captain Duncan Forbes through injury. He scored in City's first ever top flight victory over rivals Ipswich Town in a 2‚Äì1 win. He also played in every League Cup game on the road to the final at Wembley in the same season. The following season saw Anderson join Colchester United on loan. Signed by Jim Smith as a temporary replacement for Paul Aimson, Anderson made four appearances and helped the club to promotion to the Third Division. After leaving Norwich, having made 236 appearances and scored 16 goals, Anderson joined North American Soccer League team Baltimore Comets. He made 17 appearances in the 1974 season, providing four assists. He returned to England to play for Scunthorpe United and Crewe Alexandra during the off-season, making ten and four appearances respectively. He rejoined Baltimore for the 1975 season, making 19 appearances and providing one assist. The club folded in 1975 and Anderson once again returned to England to sign for Colchester United for a second spell. Signed by Bobby Roberts prior to his first full season in charge, Anderson was a regular in the opening fixtures of the 1975‚Äì76 season, but he couldn't help prevent the club from being relegated to the Fourth Division. He made his final appearance in a 6‚Äì0 thrashing by Brighton and was released at the end of the season. Personal life Following his retirement from playing, Anderson became the landlord of the Castle Hotel in Caister-on-Sea in Norfolk and worked in a sports shop. Death Four years after playing his last game, on 24 January 1980, Anderson went on a training run in Great Yarmouth. He never returned from his run, and his body was found one week later having drowned at some point between this time. His exact date of death was never discovered.

She was introduced in Herbert's 1976 novel Children of Dune and appeared decades later in the 2008 novel Paul of Dune by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. As established in the appendix of Dune (1965), Wensicia is the third daughter of the 81st Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV and Anirul, a Bene Gesserit of Hidden Rank. Her oldest sister is the Princess Irulan; her three other siblings are sisters Chalice, Josifa and Rugi. Wensicia accompanies her father into exile on Salusa Secundus after he is deposed by Paul Atreides in Dune. Wensicia is portrayed by Susan Sarandon in the 2003 miniseries Frank Herbert's Children of Dune. Children of Dune In Children of Dune, Wensicia is described as \\"fair-haired\\" with a \\"heart- shaped face,\\" and said to have learned \\"shifty trickiness\\" from her sister Irulan but not herself been trained by the Bene Gesserit. She notes, \\"Irulan once divulged to me some of the things she'd learned. She was showing off at the time, and I saw no demonstrations. Still the evidence is pretty conclusive that Bene Gesserits have their ways of achieving their ends.\\" Shaddam IV's heir is Wensicia's son Farad'n, whose deceased father, Dalak, is noted to be related to Count Hasimir Fenring, a close friend of Shaddam's since childhood. As the novel begins, Shaddam is dead and Wensicia plots from exile to restore House Corrino to its former glory and wrest control of the Empire for Farad'n. She attempts to assassinate Leto II and Ghanima Atreides, the heirs to deceased Emperor Paul Atreides, by sending mechanically controlled Laza tigers to hunt them in the desert. Leto's growing prescience allows him to thwart the attack on himself and his twin sister; he pretends to be dead to escape the increasingly murderous ambitions of his father's sister Alia. Farad'n ‚Äî newly trained in the Bene Gesserit ways by Paul and Alia's mother Lady Jessica ‚Äî accepts an arrangement brokered by Jessica for him to marry Ghanima and share the throne; his part of the deal is to \\"denounce and banish\\" Wensicia for Leto's murder, which he does. Leto later returns and ascends the throne himself. In adaptations Wensicia is portrayed by Susan Sarandon in the Sci Fi Channel's 2003 miniseries Frank Herbert's Children of Dune, which is an adaptation of both Dune Messiah (1969) and its sequel Children of Dune. Sarandon told The New York Times, \\"One of the reasons I always loved the books was because they were driven by strong women, living outside the rules.\\" She added that the Dune series \\"is very apropos to some of what's going on in the world today. It's about the dangers of fundamentalism and the idea that absolute power corrupts.\\" The actress said of Wensicia, \\"She's just evil, evil, evil. I'm practically unrecognizable. It was a blast.\\" Laura Fries of Variety wrote, \\"it‚Äôs Susan Sarandon and Alice Krige [as Lady Jessica] who steal the thunder as opposing matriarchs of the great royal houses. Although the two never catfight, their ongoing struggle to rule the Dune dynasty gives this mini a real kick.\\" Observing that Sarandon and Krige were \\"clearly relishing their roles\\", Fries added that \\"Sarandon makes a formidable enemy\\". Melanie McFarland of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer noted, \\"[Sarandon's] exiled princess may be the villain, cooking up deadly schemes, but we're right along with her in having a good time.\\" Sarandon herself said, \\"it's always fun to play a smart villain.\\" Not impressed overall with the acting in the miniseries, Ron Wertheimer of The New York Times wrote: In the miniseries, Wensicia orchestrates the Dune Messiah conspiracy to assassinate Paul using a pre-programmed Tleilaxu ghola of his deceased friend Duncan Idaho, a plotline in which she is not involved in the novel.

It tells the story of the main character Capell and his journey to sever the chains that are holding the moon, with the help of the Liberation Force. The game received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Gameplay Infinite Undiscovery is based on the player making real-time decisions that can affect the outcome of the story. These decisions can occur at any time, even while the player is going through inventory in the menu. The player controls the main character, Capell, from a third-person perspective while three other characters are controlled by AI. The player fights battles with this team of four, or sometimes with multiple teams formed from a possible 18 characters. In battle, Capell has the ability to use connect actions, which give him access to other team members' skills. The game was originally meant to transition between day and night every 10 minutes, giving the player different opportunities; for instance, stealth would be easier at night. However, this system was later removed. Director Hiroshi Ogawa explained that other forms of stealth remained in the game: ‚ÄúAs an example, when you‚Äôre running away from a hunting dog, you can distract him by dropping apples from the trees. However, the guards may catch you when they hear the thud of the apples.‚Äù Plot Infinite Undiscovery takes place in a world where the Dreadknight Leonid and his Order of Chains bound the world to the Moon from all regions. The Main Chain is attached to the castle in the fallen Kingdom of Cassandra (formerly the kingdom of King Volsung) - wherein Leonid's headquarters lies. Any region bound with a Chain suffers blight consequences: crops wither and animals die. Thus, Sigmund the Liberator goes forth, alongside his Liberation Force, to unchain the world. An unwitting young man, Capell, is fatefully thrown into this conflict, of which he wants no involvement. Inevitably, these chain of events will change his life and those around him, forever... Development Infinite Undiscovery was announced in September 2006 by Famitsu. Initially it was believed that Microsoft would publish the game, but at TGS 2007, Hajime Kojima and Hiroshi Ogawa stated that Square Enix would take over publishing duties because they have more \\"know-how\\" with RPGs. However, since Microsoft was the original publisher, it holds the trademark for the game and shares the copyright with Square Enix. According to tri-Ace co-founder and R&D; programmer Yoshiharu Gotanda, the game is set to contain 10 years' worth of ideas that can finally be realized with the Xbox 360, and with it, role-playing video games \\"will undergo a true evolution.\\" Tri-Ace wished to achieve this by putting the player through \\"situational battles\\" that would lead to \\"unknown discoveries\\" and cause permanent changes to the world. The game was directed by Hiroshi Ogawa and produced by Hajime Kojima, both of whom are also credited in the tri-Ace titles Star Ocean: Till the End of Time and Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth. Tri-Ace president Yoshiharu Gotanda signed on as the game's lead programmer. Scenario was handled by ORG Ltd., including Ryo Mizuno and Shoji Gatoh. The game's characters were designed by Yukihiro Kajimoto. The English dub was the first title released from New Generation Pictures's Shanghai Studios. As such it features voice actors from Texas and Los Angeles, as well as a large helping of new talent from Shanghai. Reception By September 30, 2008, Infinite Undiscovery had shipped 120,000 copies in Japan, 200,000 copies in North America, and 90,000 copies in Europe. The game also sold 96,000 copies by its third week. Famitsu gave it a total score of 32 out of 40 from four reviewers (9, 8, 8, 7). Internationally, the game received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN said, \\"This isn't a game marred with horrendous bugs or unplayable combat. And it's not boring. It's just misguided. The story is intriguing enough that RPG fanatics should at least give this a rental.\\" 1UP.com said, \\"Undiscovery is absolutely worth playing through at least once, with the regrettable caveat that it really could've been so much more.\\" GamePro said, \\"In the end, Undiscovery isn't a bad game but it is seriously flawed. I'd recommend renting it before you invest your hard earned cash on a purchase, especially if you're new to the RPG genre.\\" GameSpot felt that the game was too flawed to reach its potential.

In response, the Football Association commissioned a report from Lord Stevens, former Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, and subsequently an investigation was carried out by the City of London police, leading to many arrests. Allegations January ‚Äì Managers In January 2006, then Luton Town manager, Mike Newell and then-manager of Queens Park Rangers, Ian Holloway alleged that bribes were rife in the sport. The Football Association subsequently held talks with the two managers and established an enquiry. September ‚Äì BBC Panorama On 19 September 2006 the BBC current affairs television programme Panorama broadcast a special investigation into corruption in English football which had begun filming in August 2005. \\"Undercover: Football's Dirty Secrets\\" included footage shown of meetings between agents, managers and high ranking football club officials, filmed undercover by Knut auf dem Berge, a freelance coach posing as a prospective football agent. This footage purported to show agents and managers accepting backhanders and illegally \\"tapping-up\\" players under contract to other clubs. These allegations included: * That Bolton Wanderers manager Sam Allardyce, and his agent son Craig were alleged to have accepted bribes from agents for signing certain players. Two agents, Teni Yerima and Peter Harrison, were secretly filmed, each separately claiming that they had paid Allardyce through his son. Allardyce denies ever taking, or asking for, a bribe. * Then Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp is secretly filmed discussing the possibility of buying the Blackburn Rovers captain Andy Todd with agent Peter Harrison, which is illegal under FA rules. However, the programme merely showed Harrison approaching Redknapp and asking direct questions which Redknapp answered. * Then Portsmouth first-team coach Kevin Bond, first team coach of Newcastle United when the programme was aired, is secretly recorded admitting he would consider discussing receiving payments from a proposed new agency involving agent Peter Harrison. This was the programme's description; it did not seem explicit from the extract broadcast. Bond was suspended and then sacked by Newcastle as a result of the allegations. * Chelsea director of youth football Frank Arnesen is secretly filmed making an illegal approach or \\"tapping up\\" Middlesbrough's England youth star 15-year-old Nathan Porritt. Arnesen offers a fee of ¬£150,000 spread over three years as an incentive to move, although he had been advised that it was 99.9% certain that Porritt would leave Middlesbrough. Both of these allegations are illegal under FA rules. Officials from Liverpool and Newcastle United were also implicated in attempts to sign Porritt. * Agent Peter Harrison told the undercover reporter that, to secure transfer deals with Bolton, he bribed Sam Allardyce by offering to pay his son Craig. Harrison is a FIFA-listed agent, who is based in the north-east of England. * That three different Bolton transfer signings involved secret payments from agents to Craig Allardyce, some when he was contractually banned from doing any Bolton deals. Panorama alleged Bolton's transfer signings of defender Tal Ben Haim, midfielder Hidetoshi Nakata and goalkeeper Ali Al Habsi involved secret payments from agents to Craig Allardyce. Allardyce's son quit the agency business in summer 2006, and has admitted in newspaper interviews that his working as an agent might have cost his father the chance of becoming England manager. * Agent Charles Collymore, is secretly filmed in the Panorama film, saying: \\"There's managers out there who take bungs all day long. I would say to you comfortably there's six to eight managers we could definitely approach and they'd be up for this no problem.\\" Later, Collymore is named publicly for the first time by Luton Town manager Mike Newell as the agent who offered him an illegal payment. Collymore also represents England cricketer Simon Jones. The programme also claimed to have set up a sting involving handing a cash payment to an unnamed Premiership manager, but the alleged manager did not turn up at the rendezvous. The programme claimed that he had been scared off by Mike Newell's claims being revealed that same day. September ‚Äì Telegraph Sport On 26 September, the Daily Telegraph alleged that an unlicensed agent was paid in the deal to bring Tal Ben Haim to Bolton Wanderers. When the Israeli international moved to England, agent Jamie Hart ‚Äì the official middle man ‚Äì was paid a fee by Bolton. But he has now confirmed that unlicensed agent David Abu also received a cut of the fee for the role he played in the deal. Allardyce's son, Craig, a key protagonist in the Panorama documentary, also received a payment but when quizzed on such payments Bolton Chairman Phil Gartside confirmed he had no such knowledge. Reaction On 3 March 2006, The Football Association established an enquiry to be headed by Lord Stevens, former Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police and former head of an enquiry into corruption in cricket. The initial findings of Stevens' report were announced in December 2006. On 20 September, The Football Association asked the BBC to provide all of the collected evidence and announced that it would investigate these allegations. It was to investigate allegations of illegal approaches involving Chelsea sporting director Frank Arnesen, Liverpool, Newcastle United and Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp, along with allegations \\"relating to players' agents and connected activities\\" involving Bolton Wanderers manager Sam Allardyce, son Craig Allardyce, Newcastle United assistant manager Kevin Bond, and agents Charles Collymore and Peter Harrison. All of those accused of impropriety have denied all allegations arising from the programme, including: * Sam Allardyce: said that he had placed the matter in the hands of his lawyers. On 25 September he announced that after lengthy discussions his lawyers had advised that \\"I have a very strong case in relation to the programme, and I am planning to sue the BBC over the false and highly damaging allegations. I have therefore instructed my lawyers to prepare my case against the BBC.\\" Allardyce added that he would discuss the matter with Bolton chairman, Phil Gartside, as well as his wife before he took any final decision. Allardyce has not yet filed any legal action against the BBC, meaning the allegations remain legally unchallenged. * Kevin Bond: said that he intended to sue the BBC for libel. Newcastle United placed him on gardening leave following the broadcast, and terminated his contract on 26 September. In response, Bond issued a statement claiming that Newcastle had sacked him without investigating properly. Bond was employed again within a month, as manager of Bournemouth. Kevin Bond filed legal papers against the BBC, but withdrew the libel action, 8 days before the trial was set to commence. The BBC's claims against Bond remain legally unchallenged. The League Managers Association demanded hard evidence: \\"As the organisation which represents managers we were very disappointed with the programme. There was a complete lack of substance and evidence, and if the BBC has any hard evidence it should give it to the Football Association.\\" HM Revenue & Customs has also indicated it will look into the claims. No libel proceedings were issued by any of those accused of wrongdoing in the broadcast. Stevens report It was announced on 2 October 2006 that Lord Stevens' inquiry into football corruption had been extended by two months to investigate 39 transfers involving eight clubs. On 20 December 2006, Stevens presented his preliminary report, which found that while the level of corruption within English football was not as high as had been anticipated, there were several causes for concern. Seventeen transfer deals were still subject to further scrutiny. On 15 June 2007, Lord Stevens' inquiry issued its final report which raised concerns over issues involving 17 player transfers, involving five clubs, three managers and numerous agents and other third parties. In summary, the report stated: \\"there is no evidence of any irregular payments to club officials or players, and they are identified only as a consequence of the outstanding issues the inquiry has with the agents involved\\". Details of one of the suspect transfer deals was withheld. The other transfers about which there are unresolved issues are: Bolton Wanderers * Ali Al-Habsi (Free transfer from Lyn Oslo ‚Äì 7 January 2006) * Tal Ben Haim (Free transfer from Maccabi Tel Aviv ‚Äì 29 July 2004) * Blessing Kaku (Free transfer from F.C. Ashdod ‚Äì 24 August 2004) * Julio Correia (Free transfer from Real Valladolid ‚Äì 25 July 2004) There were also unanswered concerns regarding the involvement of Craig Allardyce in a number of transactions. \\"The inquiry remains concerned at the conflict of interest that it believes existed between Craig Allardyce, his father Sam Allardyce ‚Äì the then manager at Bolton ‚Äì and the club itself\\". Chelsea * Didier Drogba (¬£24 million from Marseille ‚Äì 20 July 2004) * Petr ƒåech (¬£7 million from Rennes ‚Äì 1 June 2004) * Michael Essien (¬£24.4 million from Lyon ‚Äì 19 August 2005) \\"Agent Pinhas Zahavi has failed to co-operate fully with the inquiry. There was an initial failure to disclose his involvement in a number of transfers but, more seriously, he has failed to provide the inquiry with complete bank statements due to the confidential nature of them. There has also been a lack of responsiveness by Zahavi. There remains questions relating to his relationship with, and payments to, licensed agent Barry Silkman, and with Silkman's failure to initially disclose his involvement in all the transactions in which he has received fees\\". Middlesbrough * F√°bio Rochemback (Free transfer from Barcelona ‚Äì 31 August 2005) * Yakubu (¬£7.5 million from Portsmouth ‚Äì 4 July 2005) The statement relating to Zahavi and Silkman above also relates to the two Middlesbrough transfers. Newcastle United * Albert Luque (¬£8.5 million from Deportivo La Coru√±a ‚Äì 26 August 2005) * Emre Bel√∂zoƒülu (¬£3.8 million from Inter Milan ‚Äì 14 July 2005) * Jean- Alain Boumsong (¬£8 million from Rangers ‚Äì 1 January 2005) * Amdy Faye (¬£2 million from Portsmouth ‚Äì 25 January 2005) \\"There remains inconsistencies in evidence provided by Graeme Souness ‚Äì a former manager of the club ‚Äì and Kenneth Shepherd‚Äù (son of the former Newcastle chairman Freddy Shepherd)‚Äú‚Äî apparently acting in an undefined role but not as a club official ‚Äì as to their respective roles in transfer negotiations\\". Souness issued a statement denying any wrongdoing: \\"I cannot understand why my name features in this report. I volunteered full information to Quest as a witness and I have heard nothing further from them.\\" The Stevens enquiry then issued a clarification: \\"We wish to make it clear that inconsistencies did not exist within the evidence given by Graeme Souness to Quest concerning his role in transfers covered by the Inquiry during his time as manager of Newcastle United FC and neither the Premier League nor do Quest have any concerns in this regard\\". \\"The inquiry has been unable to obtain the co-operation of the agent Ahmet Bulut‚Äù in connection with the Emre transfer. \\"The inquiry is still awaiting clarification from agent Willie McKay‚Äù in connection with the Boumsong and Faye transfers. However, Quest later issued the following statement: \\"Further to the key findings from the final Quest report published on 15 June 2007 by the Premier League, Quest would like to emphasise that, in that report, it was clear that no evidence of irregular payments was found in the transfers in the inquiry period which involved the agent Willie McKay. Quest would also like to thank Mr McKay for his cooperation with the inquiry.\\" In relation to the Luque transfer: \\"The inquiry still has unanswered questions relating to possible payments made by agent Francis Martin, who Newcastle officials believed was working for the selling club\\". Portsmouth * Collins Mbesuma (Free transfer from Kaizer Chiefs ‚Äì 1 August 2005) * Benjani Mwaruwari (¬£4.1 million from Auxerre ‚Äì 6 January 2006) * Aliou Ciss√© (¬£300,000 from Birmingham City ‚Äì 6 August 2004) \\"Agent Willie McKay acted for the selling club, Auxerre, in the transfer of Benjani and for Portsmouth in the transfer of Cisse and, for the same reason as above\\" (still awaiting clarification) \\"the inquiry is not prepared to clear these transfers at this stage\\". However, as mentioned above, the enquiry issued a further statement saying that no evidence of irregular payments had been found in the transfers in the inquiry period which involved McKay and thanking McKay for his co-operation. \\"In relation to Benjani‚Äôs transfer, the inquiry also has identified concerns regarding the role of (agent) Teni Yerima and (third party) Ralph N‚ÄôKomo.‚Äù With regard to manager Harry Redknapp, his ownership of a racehorse named \\"Double Fantasy\\" thought to have been given to him by the agent Willie McKay, has aroused some suspicion. Redknapp told the inquiry that it was possible that he did own the horse but insisted that he had not made any money out of it because the horse was a failure and never won a race. November 2007 arrests On 28 November 2007 it was reported by BBC News that the then Portsmouth manager, Harry Redknapp, Managing Director, Peter Storrie, former Portsmouth chairman, Milan Mandaric, former Portsmouth footballer Amdy Faye and agent Willie McKay had been arrested by City of London Police in relation to the ongoing inquiries into allegations of corruption in football.Redknapp held in football inquiry BBC News ‚Äì 28 November 2007Redknapp arrested in corruption investigation Guardian Unlimited ‚Äì 28 November 2007 2008 investigations City of London Police continued an ongoing investigation in 2008, including a search of Birmingham City in March. Birmingham officials Karren Brady and David Sullivan were arrested, interviewed and released on bail in April; David Gold and Julia Shelton were interviewed in July. Pascal Chimbonda was released from bail in June, effectively clearing him of wrongdoing. The Guardian reported in June 2009, that both Kevin Bond and Harry Redknapp had dropped their libel cases against the BBC, shortly before the trial. Meaning the BBC's claims are now legally unchallenged. When questioned on the subject, the FA stated that their own investigation was still ongoing, and any charges will probably wait until the government's own investigation into football corruption has concluded. On 14 May 2008, The Football Association dropped one of the two charges it had brought against each of six players' agents relating to alleged breaches of rules in transfer dealings at Luton Town.\\"FA drops charge against agents over Luton transfer irregularities\\" by David Conn, The Guardian, 14 May 2008 The F.A. has laid twelve charges against agents - two each against Sky Andrew, Mike Berry, Mark Curtis, Stephen Denos, and Andrew Mills. The first charge was that payments were made to them by a third company, unrelated to the club and not by the club itself. All six had denied the charge and, eventually, after seven months of \\"investigation,\\" the charge was dropped. The other charge against each agent was that they did not have written agreements, a.k.a. \\"representation contracts,\\" to act for the club when conducting negotiations. F.A. stated it is continuing with that one. Denos, Manasseh and Berry have admitted the charge but Andrew, Curtis and Mills denied it and requested personal hearings. Agent Andrew Mills, who had never previously been charged with any disciplinary offence since he began as a FIFA-licensed agent in 1993, stated that he was disappointed by the \\"sensationalist coverage\\" of the case. \\"The headlines suggested there had been serious wrongdoing,\\" Mills said. \\"It is now clear that was not the case.\\" See also *2016 English football scandal References 2006 Corruption Corruption English Category:Association football controversies Category:Controversies in England Category:Corruption in England COn Category:Sports scandals in England ","title":"2006 English football corruption investigation"},{"id":"7080872","text":"The Insurance Regulatory Information System (IRIS) is a database of insurance companies in the United States run by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.

Attack on convoy BN 7 The only appreciable action in which the destroyers were involved was the attack on the Allied convoy BN 7, on the first hours of 21 October 1940. Nullo and Sauro, along with Leone and Pantera shelled the convoy and its escort, inflicting some splinter damage to the leading transport ship, and launched at least two torpedoes aimed at , which successfully dodged them.O'Hara, p. 103 The attack was nevertheless repulsed by the cruiser HMS Leander, which fired 129 six-inch rounds on the Italian destroyers. While Sauro and the other destroyers successfully disengaged, Nullo was chased by the destroyer and forced to run aground on Harmil island, where she was later wrecked by RAF Blenheim bombers. Kimberley took two hits on a boiler from coastal batteries, and had to be towed to Aden by HMS Leander. End of the surviving units The three surviving destroyers remained at dock in Massawa until the very end of ground operations in East Africa. Their commander ordered them to steam out on 2 April 1941, for an almost suicidal attack on Port Sudan.

An electronic classroom and two film viewing rooms are available for library instruction and workshops. In 1987, Hunter Library created the Hunter Scholar award to encourage faculty scholarship. Hunter Scholar rewards faculty whose research makes extensive use of library collections.  Noteworthy Collections  Of particular note in the Library is Special Collections. This restricted access section of the Library has papers and photographs related to Horace Kephart's life in North Carolina, the history of Western Carolina University and surrounding area, and manuscripts related to the Cherokee Indians, the cultural and natural history of western North Carolina and vicinity, and literary works of native or naturalized North Carolinians who reside in the area. Special Collections also maintains the Cherokee Phoenix project, which translated and digitized selected articles that appeared in the Cherokee newspaper from 1828-1834. Hunter Library is heavily involved with several grant-based digitization projects. \\"Craft Revival: Shaping Western North Carolina Past and Present\\" was funded by a Heritage Partners grant from the North Carolina Library Services and Technology Act. Its purpose was to create a web-based digital history of the historic effort to revive handcraft in the western part of the state. Other noteworthy collections include \\"The Great Smoky Mountains: A Park for America,\\" \\"Stories of Mountain Folk,\\" \\"Picturing Appalachia,\\" and \\"Horace Kephart: Revealing an Enigma.\\" The Curriculum Materials Center, located in the upper mezzanine floor of Hunter Library supports teacher education students for their field experiences, children's and adolescent literature, and teaching methodology coursework. Layout Hunter Library has three floors and two mezzanines. The main floor includes reference books, current and bound periodicals, government documents, microforms, maps, leisure reading, and audio/visual materials. The Library's primary service points, circulation and reference, are also located on the main floor. The ground floor is where the general stacks of monographs reside, as well as some older reference items. The perimeter of the ground floor also has group study rooms, available on a first-come first-served basis, and lockable study rooms, available on a limited basis to faculty only. The Technology Commons also occupy part of the ground floor of Hunter Library. The top floor houses Hunter Library's Special Collections as well as the administrative offices of the Library. The two mezzanines are occupied by the Curriculum Materials Center (CMC Mezzanine), which houses teaching materials and children's books, and Lower Level Mezzanine, which houses older bound periodicals and a limited number of private study rooms that are available to graduate students. The building itself is also home to a Java City coffee shop, the Coulter Faculty Commons, and the Mountain Heritage Center.

History The original King's School building. The King's School has an unbroken history on the same site since its re-endowment in 1528 by Richard Foxe, although its history can be traced back to 1329. Sir Nikolaus Pevsner in his Buildings of England, dates the original School building to 1497. Foxe was born and raised locally. He entered into the service of Henry Tudor, while Henry was in exile in Brittany. When Henry took the throne of England as Henry VII, Foxe became his secretary, and later founded Corpus Christi College, Oxford (1517) and Taunton Grammar School (1522). In the 16th century the School became known as the Free Grammar School of King Edward VI. Scholars numbered perhaps a few dozen at foundation, and there were still fewer than one hundred until the 20th century. Isaac Newton was a King's School scholar between 1655 and 1660. As was customary in his time, he carved his signature on the wall of what is today's school side hall, although the signature has never been confirmed as authentic; visitors from around the world come to view this indication of Newton's education. A replica of the signature is on display in Grantham Museum. The novelist and eccentric Frederick Rolfe ('Baron Corvo') was briefly a teacher at the school. In 1988, a comprehensive illustrated history of the School was published by former King's School mathematics teacher, S J Branson: The King's School Grantham ‚Äì 660 years of a Grammar School. Today The King's School has just over 1000 boys as pupils, and has been a selective state grammar school since the implementation of the 1944 Education Act. School links King's and another Grantham grammar school, Kesteven and Grantham Girls' School, have shared teaching resources for sixth form study in certain subjects. Since 2006‚Äì2007, timetables for this study have been co- ordinated between both schools to aid learning.

On 9 April 1987, Screensport broadcast live coverage of the US Masters golf from Augusta, and many other PGA Tour events. Grand Slam tennis was also covered in the shape of the US Open. NHL ice hockey, NBA and NASCAR racing were common items on the schedule during this period. During the 1987-88 football season, Screensport was the only source of weekly extended English Football League highlights for the United Kingdom viewers.

He played football with his local club St Vincent's and was a senior member of the Dublin county team from 1974 until 1985. Mullins later served as manager of both Dublin and Derry. He is regarded as one of Dublin's greatest-ever players. He is a nephew of Bill Casey, who played for Kerry in the 1930s and 1940s. Biography Mullins was born in Dublin in 1954. He received his primary and secondary education in Dublin before later attending Thomond College in Limerick. Here Mullins completed a Bachelor of Arts in physical education and Irish. Mullins subsequently returned to Dublin where he secured a teaching job in Greendale Community School in Kilbarrack on the north side of the city. Here he taught his degree subjects as well history and geography. In 1980 he took eighteen months leave of absence from Greendale to complete a Master of Arts in athletics administration at New York University. When Mullins returned from the United States he resumed his teaching post at Greendale and stayed there until 1991. That year he was appointed Head Teacher of Carndonagh Community School in Inishowen, County Donegal, in Ulster. Mullins returned to Dublin in 2000 to take up his role as UCD Director of Sport. In May 2020, the Irish Independent named Mullins at number seven in its \\"Top 20 footballers in Ireland over the past 50 years\\". Playing career Club Mullins played his club football with the famous St Vincent's club in Dublin and enjoyed much success during a career that spanned three decades. He first came to prominence on the club scene as a member of the senior team in the early 1970s. In 1972, Mullins lined out in his first county championship decider. College side UCD provided the opposition on that occasion and a close game developed. Key goals by St Vincent's proved the difference as Mullins's side won by 2‚Äì8 to 0‚Äì9. It was his first county senior championship winners' medal. St Vincent's subsequently represented the county in the provincial club series of games and even reached the final. Westmeath champions the Downs were the opponents. The game turned into a complete rout as Mullins's side took complete control. A 6‚Äì10 to 2‚Äì5 score line gave St Vincent's a first Leinster club title. An All-Ireland final against Cork champions Nemo Rangers followed for Mullins. The sides were level six times in that game and a pointed free by Jimmy Keaveney secured a draw. The replay saw St. Vincent's being completely outclassed as Nemo won by 4‚Äì6 to 0‚Äì10. St Vincent's lost out to UCD in the next two county finals; however, both sides met in the championship decider for a fourth consecutive year in 1975. Mullins's side were awarded the title after the collegians gave them a walkover due to the final clashing with the university exams. A second provincial championship decider quickly followed for Mullins. St Joseph's provided the opposition, however, the Laois county champions were easily accounted for by 3‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì8.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 204 It was Mullins's second Leinster club winners' medal. A second All-Ireland club final appearance followed with Roscommon Gaels lining out in opposition. The game was a complete mismatch as St Vincent's secured a huge 4‚Äì10 to 0‚Äì5 victory. It was Mullins's first All-Ireland club winners' medal.The GAA Book of Lists pp. 417‚Äì418 Mullins picked up a third county winners' medal in 1976, as St Vincent's retained their title after a narrow 3‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì15 victory over UCD. Their provincial run of success came to a halt in the early rounds of that series of games. In 1977, St Vincent's made it three-in-a-row with another huge county final victory. It was Mullins's fourth county title. In spite of some great displays in the county champions, St Vincent's were later defeated by Summerhill of Meath in the Leinster final.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 177 St Vincent's went into decline for the next few years while Mullins missed the club's county final victory in 1981. In 1984, Mullins was back in yet another county final. Na Fianna provided the opposition, however, St. Vincent's engineered a win and Mullins added a fifth winners' medal to his collection in that competition. He later collected a third Leinster club winners' medal following a ten-point win over Wicklow champions Tinahely.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 206 The subsequent All- Ireland club final pitted St. Vincent's against Castleisland Desmonds of Kerry. The game has gone down in history as one of the most tense championship deciders of all-time that featured a dramatic finish. With two minutes left Mullins's side had a 0‚Äì7 to 1‚Äì2 lead. A line ball by Castleisland's Willie O'Connor found Donie Buckley who sent the ball into the net. St Vincent's had no time to launch a comeback and the Kerrymen secured a remarkable 2‚Äì2 to 0‚Äì7 victory.The GAA Book of Lists p. 420 In 1991, Mullins captained St Vincent's to win their third Intermediate Football Championship, beating St Brigid's in the Final. This was his last competitive outing as he retired after the game. Under-21 Mullins first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of a very good Dublin under-21 team in the early 1970s. In 1974 'the Dubs' reached the provincial decider in that grade for the first time ever. Wexford provided the opposition on that occasion, however, Mullins's side had a relatively easy victory. The 1‚Äì10 to 0‚Äì8 score line gave him a first Leinster under-21 title.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 162 Dublin were subsequently defeated in the All-Ireland semi-final. In 1975 Mullins lined out in a second consecutive provincial under-21 final. 'The Dubs' retained their title on that occasion following a 0‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì6 defeat of Laois. An All-Ireland final appearance quickly followed for Mullins. Kerry, a team that he would later become very familiar with, were the opponents. The Munster men made no mistake and secured a 1‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì10 defeat of Mullins's side.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 156 Senior By this stage Mullins was carving out a reputation for himself as a midfielder of note on the Dublin senior team. In 1974 he played in his first Leinster final in that grade. Archrivals Meath set out to stop 'the Dubs' claiming a first provincial title since 1965. A new look Dublin under the stewardship of Kevin Heffernan made no mistake in securing a 1‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì9 victory.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 142 It was Mullins's first Leinster winners' medal in the senior grade. Dublin later surprisingly defeated All-Ireland title-holders Cork in the semi-final, thus booking a place in the All-Ireland final against Galway. The men from the west, who had been beaten in two of the previous three championship deciders, took a 1‚Äì4 to 0‚Äì5 lead at half-time, however, the real turning point of the game came in the 52nd minute. Galway were awarded a penalty which Liam Sammon stepped up to take. Goalkeeper Paddy Cullen made no mistake and saved the shot. 'The Dub's' later went on to take the lead as Galway collapsed. A 0‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì6 score line resulted in a first All-Ireland winners' medal for Mullins and a first for Dublin in eleven years.The GAA Book of Lists p. 403 Dublin proved that their success in 1974 was not a flash-in- the-pan by retaining the Leinster title in 1975 after an enormous 3‚Äì13 to 0‚Äì8 defeat of Kildare. Mullins's side were the red-hot favourites going into the All-Ireland final against the youngest Kerry teams of all-time. On a rain- soaked day John Egan and substitute Ger O'Driscoll scored two goals for Kerry and 'the Dubs' were ambushed by 2‚Äì12 to 0‚Äì11. It was a bitter defeat for a Dublin team that had expected so much. Dublin continued their dominance in 1976. After securing the National League title 'the Dubs' dominated the provincial championship once again.The GAA Book of Lists p. 179 A narrow 2‚Äì8 to 1‚Äì9 defeat of Meath gave Mullins a third consecutive Leinster winners' medal. Once again it was Kerry who provided the opposition, as one of the great rivalries of football entered a new chapter. Both sides were hoping for success, however, new 'Dub' Kevin Moran was causing havoc with the Kerry defence. Immediately after the game started he careered through the Kerry half-back and full-back lines, however, his shot at goal went wide. This set the pace for the rest of the match. John McCarthy finished a five-man move to score Dublin's first goal of the day. A converted penalty by Jimmy Keaveney was followed by a third goal from Mullins.The GAA Book of Lists pp. 403‚Äì404 A 3‚Äì8 to 0‚Äì10 score line gave Dublin the title and gave Mullins a second All- Ireland winners' medal. He capped off the year by collecting his first All- Star award. The 1977 Leinster final was a replay of the previous year with the result being the same. Meath provided some stiff opposition but fell short, eventually losing the game by 1‚Äì9 to 0‚Äì8. It was Mullins's fourth consecutive Leinster title. Dublin later took on Kerry for the third consecutive year, however, this time it was in the All-Ireland semi-final. In one of the greatest games of football ever-played 'the Dubs' triumphed and booked a final spot against Armagh. An eight-goal thriller ensued, with Jimmy Keaveney scoring the first of the day after just ninety seconds. He ended the day with a record 2‚Äì6 from play. Bobby Doyle soon followed with the first of his two goals while John McCarthy got a fifth. Armagh were awarded two penalties, however, the northerners spurned some golden goal-scoring opportunities. A huge 5‚Äì12 to 3‚Äì6 victory gave Dublin a second consecutive title and gave Mullins a third All-Ireland winners' medal in four years.The GAA Book of Lists p. 404 He was later presented with a second All-Star award. 1978 saw Mullins add a second National League title to his collection.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 179 A fifth consecutive Leinster winners' medal soon followed as Dublin accounted for Kildare. The eleven-point victory in this game made Mullins's side the favourites to secure a remarkable third All-Ireland title in-a-row. While the game should have been an historic occasion, a rout ensued. The game is chiefly remembered for Mikey Sheehy's sensational goal. A free was awarded and the Kerry forward lobbed the ball over the head of Paddy Cullen, who was caught off his line arguing with the referee. New full-forward Eoin Liston entered the record books as he scored a hat-trick of goals. Pat Spillane played all over the field, including goalkeeper after Charlie Nelligan was sent off. At the full-time whistle Kerry were the winners by 5‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì9. Dublin and Mullins secured an historic sixth Leinster title in 1979 after a narrow 1‚Äì8 to 0‚Äì9 victory over a resurgent Offaly team. A record sixth consecutive All-Ireland final appearance soon followed, with Kerry providing the opposition for the fourth time in those six years. The reigning champions, however, were handicapped throughout the game. Ger Power did not start, while John O'Keeffe got injured and P√°id√≠ √ì S√© was sent off during the encounter. Two goals by Mikey Sheehy and a third by John Egan helped 'the Kingdom' to another huge 3‚Äì13 to 1‚Äì8 defeat of Dublin.The GAA Book of Lists pp. 404‚Äì405 In 1980 Dublin set out to atone for developing a reputation as Kerry's whipping boys. A record seventh consecutive Leinster title looked likely, however, in June of that year tragedy struck. Mullins was driving out the Clontarf Road in Dublin when his Fiat 127 went out of control and collided with a lamp post. The midfielder was lucky to escape with his life, however, it now looked as if the injuries which he sustained would signal the end of his football career. Nothing could be further from Mullins's mind. He completed his studies in the United States while he recovered, a miraculous recovery which saw him return to the Dublin team. In 1983 Mullins was back as a midfield marshal as 'the Dubs' took on reigning All-Ireland champions Offaly in the Leinster final. A five-point victory on that occasion gave him a seventh provincial winners' medal, a truly remarkable achievement after his accident. A thrilling draw and a replay against Cork allowed Dublin to advance to an All-Ireland final meeting with Galway. Both sides played on a day when the rain spoilt what has gone down in history as the dirtiest championship decider ever played. Barney Rock scored an opportunist goal ten minutes into the game when a Galway kick- out found him unmarked. Ray Hazley, Kieran Duff and Mullins were all sent-off for Dublin while Galway's Tom√°s Tierney was also dismissed. In spite of this Dublin's 'twelve apostles' hung on to secure a 1‚Äì10 to 1‚Äì8 victory and a fourth and final All-Ireland winners' medal for Mullins.The GAA Book of Lists p. 406 Dublin, as reigning champions, entered the centenary year championship of 1984 as favourites to retain the All-Ireland title. This favourites tag was justified as Mullins added an eighth Leinster title to his collection before later lining out in the All-Ireland decider. Kerry, a team that had carved out a reputation as one of the greatest of all-time over the previous decade, provided the opposition and a great game was expected. The spectators were disappointed as Kerry dominated the proceedings and Mullins's side collapsed. Only two of his team mates scored, including a goal from Barney Rock. At the full-time whistle Kerry were the new champions by 0‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì6. By 1985 many of the iconic Dublin players from the previous decade had retired from inter- county duty. Mullins, however, was still patrolling the midfield area. He won a ninth Leinster winners' medal that year as Laois were defeated by 0‚Äì10 to 0‚Äì4 in the provincial decider. A ninth All-Ireland final appearance beckoned for Mullins, with Kerry providing the opposition for a second consecutive year. Jack O'Shea got Kerry on the way and scored a key penalty goal after just eleven minutes. By half-time Kerry had stormed into a nine-point lead. 'The Dubs' came storming back with full-forward Joe McNally scoring two goals. The gap could not be bridged, however, and Kerry won by 2‚Äì10 to 2‚Äì8. Following this game Mullins decided to retire from inter-county football. Post-playing career He retired from inter-county football in 1985, and became the caretaker manager for Dublin in 1986, along with Sean Doherty (GAA player) and Robbie Kelleher. The stint only lasted a year and ended with a disappointing loss to rivals Meath. Meath had been in the GAA wilderness for 16 years so, a loss to Meath in the Leinster final came as a shock. Early in 1996, he was appoint as manager of Derry GAA senior team and stayed for three seasons. He won a league title in 1996, was beaten by Cavan GAA by a point in the 1997 Ulster final before going one better in 1998 to win the county's last Ulster title. In 2008, there was speculation that Mullins would succeed Paul Caffrey as Dublin manager. However, he turned down the job. He had withdrawn his name from consideration on the previous occasion when the post was vacant in 2004 after a breakdown in negotiations with the Dublin County Board. Mullins gave an exclusive interview to Gary Moran of RT√â Sport for the Sunday Sport programme of Sunday 21 November 2004 in which he explained his decision, including the board's failure to match his ambition for Dublin football and the fact that he had no communication from the County Board for over three months after attending an interview for the post, a period during which the post was offered to at least two other high-profile figures including Mick O'Dwyer.

The building houses a museum and art gallery with a collection of fine and decorative art as well as a natural history collection. It is protected as a Category A listed building. The concept for the building was originally commissioned as a memorial to Prince Albert and intended to contain room for lectures, museum, picture gallery and a reference library for students by the British Association for the Advancement of Science. It was agreed that the funding for the building should be provided by the inhabitants of Dundee. Although the city could not afford such a lavish memorial outright, it did contribute ¬£300. A guaranteed fund of ¬£4,205 15/- from 168 contributors was collected which included a munificent gift from the Baxter family which totalled ¬£420. The building was designed by the architect George Gilbert Scott, who was an expert for the restoration of mediaeval churches and advocate of the Gothic architectural style. He intended to design a large tower like in his previous work at St. Nikolai, Hamburg. The foundations were situated in a small wetland called Quaw Bog at the confluence of the Scourin Burn and Friar Burn, which has since been drained. This meant that the area under the building site was underpinned by large wood beams. However, when construction began in 1865, the ground proved too unstable to support the larger tower that he envisaged. The building was opened as the Albert Institute in 1867. Two further sections, which extended the building by four art galleries and four museum galleries, were added by 1889. The central section was designed to Scott's intention by David MacKenzie, with the Eastern Galleries by William Alexander. The contents of the Watt Institute, founded in 1848, were incorporated into the collection before the opening of the civic museum and art gallery in 1873. Between 1873 and 1949, the buildings were administrated as part of public library service. From 1959, the city corporation took over the running of the administration. Ironically, following a later refurbishment the building now commemorates the Lord Provost Maurice McManus. Initially retitled McManus Galleries, after refurbishment in 2010, it is now formally known as The McManus: Dundee's Art Gallery and Museum. Sir John Lavery RA RSA RHA (1856‚Äì1941). 1915.

The subsequent survey found that the building was partially subsiding. During 1979, remedial measures involved placing load-bearing concrete piles and cross-beams positioned to replace rotted timbers. The building was closed to the public on 24 October 2005 for a ¬£7.8million redevelopment by Page\\\\Park Architects and was reopened to the public on 28 February 2010.

The piece was commissioned jointly by the Office de Radiodiffusion T√©l√©vision Fran√ßaise (ORTF) and the Shiraz-Persepolis Festival of Arts (presided by the Empress of Iran), held at the historic site of Persepolis. The title is one of the variant names of the goddess Persephone / Proserpina, and also refers to the names \\"Perseus\\", \\"Perceval\\", and \\"Persepolis\\". It was performed in its premiere by Les Percussions de Strasbourg (France), for whom it was written. Persephassa gains much of its effect from having the six percussionists distributed around the audience. The treatment of space as a musical parameter is one of the most important preoccupations of Xenakis' music, particularly in his works of the mid-to-late 1960s. (See, for example, Terretektorh (1966), which \\"distributes the eighty-eight musicians in quasi- stochastic fashion in a circular space around the conductor, with the audience being seated amid the musicians.\\") The dramatic impact of utilizing the performance space in this manner is evident in many passages throughout the piece in which accents or imitative rhythms are passed around the ensemble. At one point, \\"Xenakis creates an enormous accelerando, building up as many as six layers of spiraling patterns swirling around the listeners. The tempo of that passage winds up to 360 beats per minute, with one complete rotation of rolled accents around the six players every second... these mesmerizing patterns are enhanced by isolated dynamic accents and by interruptions of silence or stochastic clouds of percussive sonorities.\\" The percussionists use a wide range of instruments and sound effects during the piece, including sirens, maracas, and pebbles, along with an arsenal of drums, wood blocks (simantras), cymbals, and gongs. In 2010, the Make Music New York festival presented a performance of Persephassa on and around Central Park Lake in New York City, with audience members listening from rowboats.

He was a representative of realism as well as an important precursor of impressionism in Poland.  Biography  Aleksander Gierymski completed Secondary State School nr III in Warsaw in 1867, and in the same year commenced drawing studies in Warsaw. Between 1868 ‚Äì 1872 he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich and graduated with a gold medal. He received a commendation for his diploma work The Merchant of Venice. Between 1873-1874 he stayed in Italy, mostly in Rome. There he completed his first famous works: Roman Inn and Morra Game, which Gierymski brought to Warsaw in the beginning of 1875 and exhibited at Zachƒôta Gallery. Both paintings received the attention of audiences and critics. From late 1875 until 1879 the artist returned to Rome, where he worked to improve his work, particularly spending much time studying Italian paintings. The most important work of the Roman period was his painting In the Arbour. It was an approach to impressionism, which was preceded by extensive studies in this area (for example Cylinder on a table, Man in red tail-coat among others). In the painting In the Arbour, we can see the scene of an 18th-century social gathering, which takes place in a gazebo filled with light from behind. Such scenes allowed him to play with colours and light. Gierymski's work can be compared to contemporary French impressionists, even though he had not yet been in Paris and there was no evidence that he had seen their work. The greatest period for Gierymski was between the years 1879 -1888 which he spent in Warsaw. In this time he worked with a group of young positivist writers and painters, clustered around the periodical Wƒôdrowiec (Eng. Wanderer). Responsible for art affairs in these magazines was Stanis≈Çaw Witkiewicz, who took up a battle for Gierymski's public recognition. Paintings, which Gierymski made in this period, for example, Jewish women selling oranges; The Old Town Gate, Solec‚Äôs Marina, The Feast of Trumpets and Sandblasters and others are based on the lives of poor people from two districts in Warsaw ‚Äì Powi≈õle and Old Town. Unfortunately, his works were never understood and respected in contemporary Poland. As other unappreciated persons in his motherland, without livelihoods, he left Warsaw behind and went abroad in 1888. Since then he was mostly living in Germany and France. Changed surroundings changed his works. Away from his homeland, he started to paint subjects that weren't so personal. He was mostly painting landscapes (Kufstein Castel Outlook, Part of Rothenburg, sea landscapes). He was frequently painting at night, which allowed him to paint objects under artificial light, such as (Munich nocturnes, Paris Opera at Night, Twilight over Seine). He came back to Poland in 1893 and stayed till 1895, in order to apply for a position at the Academy of Fine Arts in Cracow. This journey revived his interest in human subjects. The Peasant's Coffin is one of the paintings from that period. For the last years of his life he remained in Italy. From that latter period came works like Interior of Basilica of San Marco in Venice, Piazza del Popolo in Rome or outlooks of Verona. His bitter disappointments in life are revealed on his self-portrait painted a year prior to his death. He looked at the world with the eye of a naturalist, despite his hot-temper. Tragically, the last years of his life were spent in a mental hospital; nevertheless he left a unique heritage. His works represented realism, like Courbet‚Äôs, and he wasn't afraid to represent all matters of life, including the lives of humble people. Gierymski died between 6-8 of March 1901 in Rome in a mental hospital on Via della Lungara Street. He was buried at the Campo Verano Cemetery in Rome on 10 March 1901.

Its classification is still controversial and uncertain. It is variously treated as a separate species, as a subspecies of the American herring gull (L. smithsonianus) or included with both the American herring gull and European herring gull in L. argentatus. The Mongolian gull, Larus mongolicus, has previously been regarded as a subspecies of the Caspian gull (L. cachinnans) but is now sometimes lumped with the Vega gull. Description Adult Vega gull in flight Vega gull (Larus vegae) The Vega gull is similar to the herring gull but is slightly darker grey above. The head of the Vega gull is heavily streaked with brown in winter, especially on the back and sides of the neck forming a collar. The legs are usually bright pink. First- and second-winter Vega gulls are darker than the similar Mongolian gull, notably on the crown of the head where Mongolian gulls even in first- and second-winter are a bit paler. Almost the full body of first- and second-winter Vega gulls displays darker brown flecks and streaks. Adult Vega gulls in winter can often be mistaken for the very similar-looking slaty-backed gull (L. schistisagus) and the western gull (L. occidentalis), but the Vega gull's gray is lighter than the two similar species. Eye colour is variable but tends to be dark with a red orbital ring. The bill is yellow with a red spot except for first- and second-winter gulls where the bill can be almost entirely dark gray/black, with the gray portion shrinking until it reaches maturity. Vega gulls in the northwestern part of their breeding range are paler above. They are sometimes considered to be a separate subspecies named Birula's gull (Larus vegae birulai). Adult Mongolian gulls swimming on Lake Baikal Mongolian gull (Larus vegae mongolicus) The back and wings of the Mongolian gull vary in colour. They are often medium grey similar to Birula's gull but can be much darker. The head of the Mongolian gull is mainly white all year round with only faint winter streaking. The legs are usually pink and the eye is usually pale with a red orbital ring. The bill is yellow with a large red spot and often with dark markings in first-, second- and third-year gulls. First- and second-winter Mongolian gulls have heavy brown/gray streaking and flecking over most of body and wings, much like the Vega gull, but not as dark. Distribution and habitat Vega gulls breed in northeastern Siberia and winter in Japan, Korea, southern and eastern China, and Taiwan. They are regularly seen on St. Lawrence Island and Nome, Alaska and may breed there. There are also records from other parts of western Alaska, and a few photo documented records from Washington and California. In their winter range they are typically found in harbours, on rocky shores and at river mouths. The Mongolian gull nests in Mongolia, neighbouring parts of Russia (such as Lake Baikal), northeastern China (e.g., Lake Hulun) and possibly South Korea. It migrates southeast to winter in southern and eastern China and Korea, with small numbers reaching Japan. In South Korea, it winters on inland waters more often than the Vega gull.

Daja Kisubo, an outcast to her people after she was the lone survivor of her family ship's wreck, and a smith mage in training, travels with her three friends and their teachers north of Emelan, to a valley plagued with drought and forest fires. While she and her friends are in Golden Ridge Valley, she creates a living metal vine. Polyam, wirok of Tenth Caravan Idaram, bids on the vine. Plot summary The story opens with the four child-mages and their teachers at the end of a caravan. Rosethorn, Briar's teacher, stops to examine the tree-litter and while she does this, Daja catches a glimpse of a forest fire miles off. Tris, Briar, and Sandry all turn to look at the fire while Rosethorn asks their local guide when the last time was that they had a forest fire. However, their guide only laughs and says their mage, called Firetamer, takes care of all their fires, just like his father did. The caravan moves on, but Daja still has an uneasy feeling about the huge fire, noting how fire could be her friend and enemy. The caravan stops in a small town to study magic and assist the Duke of Emelan with the drought. As Daja is working in the smithy, a woman, a wirok, a scorned Trader who negotiates with lugsha, tradesmen, stops by to talk to the smith. As she notices the blank cap on Daja's Trader staff which signifies her exile status, the Trader refuses to talk to her. Moments later, Daja loses control of her magic because of her anger, putting energy into a clump of melted iron. Soon, it turns into a branch and the Trader is stunned. Throughout the book, Daja and the Trader converse in a bargain for the 'living metal'. All of the student's magic is so strongly combined that Sandry is forced to create a map of their magic, which she can use to separate their twined magic. Their teachers first noticed the mixed magic when Briar and Sandry used lightning by accident. While Daja is on her way to the privy, she releases a stream of hot water from within the earth, which spills out onto the stones before her. She and Briar investigate, finding that one of the hot springs leads to an area of ice/glaciers. Melting the water would refill the drying lake, saving one of the town's problems. They also discover a vein of copper which could be used to replenish the town's supply and stimulate trade. While all the teachers and students are at a watch tower, a huge fire erupts, utilizing all the mast that had built up in the years that Yarrun Firetamer had been suppressing all the fires. After the conceited fire tamer dies in an attempt to stop the fire, the rest of the people try to stop it. Daja is caught in the middle, though, and has to first convince the caravan she is riding with to listen to her, and then stop heading for the fire. She saves the caravan by thrusting all of the fire into a vein in the earth which leads to the glacier. Lastly, Daja creates a living metal leg with the copper which is now a part of her for the wirok, restoring the wirok's ability to work with horses, her original job. Daja is a trangshi, a Trader word which literally means \\"doesn't exist\\" or \\"bad luck\\". In the end, however, she becomes a Trader again because she had gained enough zokin, or honor, by saving the Tenth Caravan Idaram from the huge forest fire.

He wrote poetry, short stories, a genre in which he is considered a master, theater and a 16 volume diary, written from 1932 to 1993.Miguel Torga Biography at Infop√©dia (Portuguese) Life He was born in the village of S√£o Martinho de Anta in the Tr√°s-os-Montes e Alto Douro region (northern Portugal), to small-time farmer parents Francisco Correia da Rocha and wife Maria da Concei√ß√£o de Barros. After a short spell as student in a catholic seminary in Lamego, his father sent him to Brazil in 1920, where he worked on an uncle's coffee plantation. His uncle, finding him to be a clever student, decided to pay for his studies. Torga returned to Portugal in 1925 to complete high school and in 1933 graduated in Medicine at the University of Coimbra. After graduation he practiced in his village of S√£o Martinho de Anta and in other places around the country. By this time, he started writing and self- publishing his books for a number of years. In 1941, he established himself as an otolaryngologist physician in Coimbra. He married Belgian Lecturer Andr√©e Crabb√© and had an only daughter, Clara Crab√©e da Rocha (b. Coimbra, 1955), Literature Lecturer and second wife in 1985 of Vasco Gra√ßa Moura. Literary work and recognition He was a member of the literary movement Presen√ßa for a short period before founding two cultural magazines in the 1930s. After the publication of the book O Quarto Dia da Cria√ß√£o do Mundo he was arrested for two months, between December 1939 and February 1940. His agnostic beliefs are reflected on his work, which deals mainly with the nobility of the human condition in a beautiful but ruthless world where God is either absent or nothing but a passive and silent, indifferent creator. The recognition of his work earned him several important awards, as the Montaigne Prize, in 1981, and the first ever Pr√©mio Cam√µes in 1989. He was several times nominated for the Nobel Prize of Literature, from 1959 to 1994, and it was often believed that he would be the first Portuguese language writer to win it (Jos√© Saramago would eventually become the first Portuguese literary Nobel winner in 1998). Brazilian novelist Jorge Amado several times stated that Torga deserved that honour and the 1978 nomination had the support of Vicente Aleixandre, the winner of the previous year.

(sometimes Diego Morcillo Rubio de Su√±√≥n de Robledo) (January 3, 1642, Villarrobledo, Albacete, Spain ‚Äì 1730, Lima, Peru) was a Spanish bishop in Peru and twice viceroy of the colony, from August 15, 1716 to October 5, 1716 (interim) and from January 26, 1720 to May 14, 1724. Biography At a young age he entered the Calced branch of the Trinitarian Order in Toledo. He studied theology at the University of Alcal√°. In Alcal√° King Charles II named him preacher of the royal chamber. He also became examiner (calficador) for the Supreme Council of the Inquisition. On November 21, 1701, he was named during the papacy of Pope Clement XI as Bishop of the Diocese of Nicaragua and consecrated in 1703 by Juan de Arg√ºelles, Bishop of Panam√°. Continuing his ecclesiastical advancement, he was appointed by Pope Clement XI as bishop of La Paz, Bolivia on May 14, 1708, by Pope Clement XI as Archbishop of the Archdiocese of La Plata o Charcas on March 21, 1714, and finally by Pope Innocent XIII as archbishop of Lima on May 12, 1723. While bishop, he was the principal consecrator of Juan de Necolalde, Bishop of Concepci√≥n (1716); Jos√© Luis Palos Bord, Coadjutor Bishop of Paraguay (1723); Jos√© Manuel de Sarricolea y Olea, Bishop of C√≥rdoba (1724); and Pedro Morcillo Rubio de Su√±√≥n, Auxiliary Bishop of Lima (1724). In 1716, while he was archbishop of Charcas, King Philip V named him interim viceroy of Peru. On August 15 he entered Lima and replaced Mateo de la Mata Ponce de Le√≥n, president of the Audiencia. Mata had also been serving on an interim basis, since the removal of Viceroy Diego Ladr√≥n de Guevara on March 2, 1716. Morcillo occupied this post until October 5, 1716, when the position was taken up by Carmine Nicolao Caracciolo, Prince of Santo Buono, the official successor of Ladr√≥n de Guevara. Morcillo then returned to his ecclesiastical duties as archbishop of Charcas. At the end of Caracciolo's term, Morcillo once again became viceroy, this time on a permanent basis. He entered Lima and took up the office on January 26, 1720. On the death of the archbishop of Lima, Antonio de Zuloaga, he also occupied that office. Among his political accomplishments were a great increase in royal revenues from the colony, and the repulse of the English pirates on the coast. During this time Pope Benedict XIII elevated two important Peruvian saints, Toribio Alfonso de Mogrovejo and Francisco de Solano. Morcillo donated large sums of money to the Trinitarian Order, to charitable works such as hospitals and schools, and for a convent for Discalced Carmelites in the town of his birth. He was recognized as intelligent and a good administrator. He wrote the book Clamores de la obligaci√≥n. In 1722, Viceroy Morcillo intervened in the Revolt of the Comuneros of Paraguay, where he stood up for Paraguay's deposed governor Reyes. Reyes had been convicted by a judge of the Royal Court of Charcas of misdeeds - but the Court had given the judge the power to succeed the governor himself, creating an obvious conflict of interest. In a series of letters with the Royal Court of Charcas, he emphasized that the choice of governor was not a judicial matter, that the judge's trial was irregular and invalid, and that Reyes should be restored to his position promptly. Partially from the strain of the affairs of being both Archbishop and Viceroy in his eighties, he retired in 1724. He died in Lima in 1730 and was interred in the crypt of the cathedral.

A native of Greensboro, North Carolina, he stood 6'5\\" () and weighed . Alston was acquired by St. Louis via a trade with the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League, where he played in 180 games in 1953, on January 26, 1954, after team president Gussie Busch told manager Eddie Stanky to find a black player. Not only did Busch think excluding blacks from baseball was morally wrong, his company Anheuser‚ÄìBusch, which had bought the team a year earlier to keep them from moving to Milwaukee, sold more beer to African-Americans than any other brewery, leading him to fear the effect of a boycott. Busch was, however, somewhat disappointed by Alston. When he reported to the Cardinals, the team learned he was two years older than the Padres had claimed. Busch demanded they return $20,000 the Cardinals had included with the trade to account for two seasons that Busch believed the team could not get from Alston. When he made his Major League debut (April 13, 1954 at Sportsman's Park), he became the first black player in St. Louis Cardinals history. He played in 66 games during his rookie season, batting .246 with 4 home runs and 34 runs batted in. After that, he got into 25 more games over the course of the next three seasons. He spent most of his major league career splitting time between the majors and the Class AAA Omaha Cardinals, where he had a .306 batting average and 21 home runs in 1956.

Biography Early life Leist has emigrated twice, from West Germany to South Africa (1988‚Äì1994) and then from South Africa to the United States. He studied Visual Arts and Photography in Munich, Cape Town and New York City. Career His works are ongoing, often participatory projects, which examine the relationship between individual lives and societies, history, landscape and architecture. For instance, Leist submitted an entry to the World Trade Center site Memorial Competition in which he proposed erecting 2,792 memorial telephone booths around the \\"footprints\\" of the former WTC site, around New York City or in any of the 92 counties where victims were from. The phones would be arbitrarily connected to another memorial phone and would let callers talk with each other or hear a pre-recorded message about a victim of the WTC disaster. His entry did not win.World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition Since 1994, Leist has worked on \\"American Portraits\\" and since 2001 on several projects in Asia. From 1995 to 2005, Leist took photographs of metropolitan life through the window of his 26th floor New York apartment on 8th Avenue, using a 19th-century full plate camera. He took pictures each day he was in New York, whenever he found the time, at every time of day, in all kinds of weather and every position of the sun. The resulting bulk of around 2,200 photographs documents both the every-day life and change of Manhattan, including the historic event of the destruction of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Parts of the collection have been published in book form under the title Eleven Septembers: Photographs by REINER LEIST. He has had numerous exhibitions in Germany, USA and Japan. Leist presently teaches at Hunter College, City University of New York. Works *Santlofer, Jonathan and Derenthal, Ludger, Eleven Septembers: Photographs by Reiner Leist (Prestel Publishing, 2006).

After the critical success of the band's previous album All Set (1996), the band became disillusioned with trying to be a rock band and set out to become more \\"modern,\\" thus birthing the project. Recording the album in Chipping Barnet with the band's bassist Tony Barber producing, Modern sees a strong electronic music influence, with electronic instruments and drum machines featuring on the songs, especially those written by Steve Diggle, who wrote five of the album's songs whilst Pete Shelley wrote the other eight songs. Although the album was recorded with the idea that it sounded contemporary, the album's sound was said to emulate new wave music from the early 1980s, including from Pete Shelley's solo career, and was also categorised as sounding like the art punk band Magazine, formed in the late 1970s by former Buzzcocks member Howard Devoto. One critic said that \\"rather than destroy the pop song they [deconstruct] it, playfully reinventing it as a catchy, self-conscious pastiche of itself.\\" Shelley's lyrical content express explosive angst and irritability coupled with lingering discomfort and frustration. The album was released in September 1999 in the UK by EMI and in the US by Go-Kart, their first release for both labels. In the UK, CD copies were paired with an enhanced CD compilation entitled A Different Kind of Product, featuring early singles by the band and computer elements such as a slide show and video compilation. Although not a commercial success, Modern received generally favourable reviews from critics, being referred to by Allmusic as a \\"minor triumph\\" and by another critic as \\"a very good record.\\" Nonetheless, the record did have some detractors. According to Mick O'Shear, Modern \\"\\"served to affirm that Buzzcocks could still appeal to a global audience while still remaining true to their original ideals.\\" Background and recording In 1993, Buzzcocks released Trade Test Transmissions, their first album since reuniting in 1989 and a return to the band's original pop punk sound and a departure from the experimental music Shelly and Diggle had recorded away from the Buzzcocks. Although it was a critical success, it was not a commercial one despite the huge surge in popularity for pop punk at the same time, They followed it with All Set (1996), another critical success which saw the band experiment \\"here and there\\" on the album with atypical instruments and arrangements. Ned Raggett of Allmusic described the experiments as \\"hints of trying to breathe once again beyond the basic formula.\\" All Set was released on I.R.S. Records, but the label closed only two months after the release of the album, leaving the band without a record label. The band were intending to tour in promotion of All Set throughout the rest of 1996 and then record and release a second album for I.R.S. Records in 1997, but the closure of the label led to the band having to cancel the plans. The album was mastered at Abbey Road Studios, London. Pete Shelley recalled that the band had become \\"uncomfortable with trying to be a rock band, when everybody's trying to be one.\\" The band thought \\"why bother\\" and with their next album made an attempt to \\"be more modern\\" and inflict new influences into their music. The concept gave the album its title, Modern. The band's bassist Tony Barber arranged and produced the new record, which was recorded in summer 1998 at The Surgery, Barnet, Herefordshire. Derek Fudge engineered the sessions. It was reported on 19 July 1998 that the band had been recording for three weeks, with another three days to go, after which Barker [who had been touring Stratford Mercenaries] will \\"come in soon to record all of the drum parts,\\" whilst biographer Tony McGartland said that \\"with the exception of minor tweaking the album will be done in early September [1998].\\" The band wrote 23 songs, but only recorded 14, with the possible intention to record the other nine songs at a later stage for usage as B-sides. The album was mixed over two weeks at Woodbine Street Recording Studios, Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, with extra engineering by Joan A. Rivers, a process which concluded on 2 October 1998, and was belatedly mastered in June 1999 by Chris Blair at the world-famous Abbey Road Studios, London. Pete Shelley wrote eight of the songs, whilst Steve Diggle wrote the remaining five songs.Liner notes. When interviewed by Ear Candy Mag, Pete Shelley said that, compared to writing songs in the 1970s, there was more ways of writing songs for Modern but \\"then again there's more distractions.\\" He said \\"I think because a lot of the songs we did as the Buzzcocks were all written five minutes before going into the studio. So, its easier when you start writing songs. You haven't got any songs that you know you are trying to write like that. So, you don't have that subconscious fear of coming up with the same song twice. It's a little bit harder than that, trying to make sure that you don't re-write the same songs ad nauseam.\\" When asked if his writing style was different than Diggle's, he said \\"well, I tend to wait until the last minute before I write songs, where Steve likes to finish them all and have them all ready. I'm notoriously bad... all right you have to do the world tour tomorrow! So I just stay up all night writing the lyrics. If it was me, I'd wait until the day of release before finishing.\\" Musical and lyrical style Unlike previous albums by the band, Modern makes prominent use of numerous electronic instruments and drum machines, particularly on Steve Diggle's material, although Shelley's songs are more akin to the band's usual \\"catchy, tightly written punk and pop songs.\\" Michael Sandlin of Pitchfork saw it as an attempt from the band to sound \\"current\\" and compared its programmed drums and \\"sputtering synth blips\\" to techno. Shelley said that the band were \\"trying not to make a rock album. So, instead of trying to make it sound like we were a rock band, we tried a more studio based approach. And, more control over what was going on. Also, we felt uncomfortable with trying to be a rock band, when everybody's trying to be one. We though, why bother...be more modern.\\" Ear Candy Mag told him that Modern \\"is contemporary, but it is definitely Buzzcocks,\\" noting that his \\"voice is very distinctive.\\" Antek Gun of Ox Fanzine said that instead of being a punk rock album, Modern sees the band \\"work with strange, rapidly alternating sounds, sizzling guitars, synthesizers from a forgotten time.\\" However, Wilson Neate of Westnet played down the electronic influence of the album, saying that the album continues the \\"pretty much\\" same approach as the band's 1970s albums: \\"short, sharp-edged, anxious and angst ridden, irritable and irritated punk pop. Modern displays a prominent electronic influence, especially on the songs written by Steve Diggle. Despite being described by some and by Shelley as an attempt to sound more modern, many critics compared it to new wave music of the late 1970s and/or early 80s; Joshua Klein of The A.V. Club said Modern was \\"something else entirely\\" from their previous albums, calling its title ironic as it \\"essentially [picks] up where the band left off in 1981\\" after they split because it \\"sounds like it was recorded just as punk turned into new wave.\\" However, he also stated that \\"oddly enough, much of Modern resembles the art punk music founding Buzzcock Howard Devoto would later make in Magazine. Mark Caro of The Chicago Tribune agreed with the former statement, saying he assumed \\"the title is meant ironically because this is a very 1982 version of modern -- i.e., the Buzzcocks have discovered synths and drum machines of the sort singer Pete Shelley was using in his brief solo career.\\" Similarly, Skate and Annoy said that \\"Modern doesn‚Äôt look or sound very modern, maybe 20 years old modern, but that‚Äôs not bad. A lot of the tracks sound like Shelley solo efforts would have sounded if he had stuck to guitars.\\" Comparisons were made between some songs and Shelley's 1983 solo album XL1. Wilson Neate of Westnet said that \\"rather than destroy the pop song they [deconstruct] it, playfully reinventing it as a catchy, self-conscious pastiche of itself.\\" Neate noted that as with previous albums, Pete Shelley's work on Modern takes the historically distant, paradigmatic pop format of 50s and 60s bubblegum boy-girl songs as its starting point, but while the lyrical and musical framework of this foundational form is left nominally intact (the harmonies, the I/you romance narrative, the straightforward verse/chorus structure and the simple chord progressions), it is compressed into a shorter, faster package, supplemented and shot through with jagged, saw-like guitars, and scattered with irregular, staccato beats, adding that \\"still crucial too is Shelley's distinctive vocal style which continues to unsettle the traditional, formal symmetry of conventional pop. Modern is rife with examples of irregular combinations of short punchy stanzas and lengthy, weaving run-on lines‚Äìsometimes stretched out for a painful but compelling duration‚Äìthat both carry and lead the songs. Moreover, this combination of the brusque and the drawn out line--on top of the contrast of the staccato beats and the whining, UK-police-siren-circa-'76 guitar sound--emphasizes the twin-pronged emotional thrust of Shelley's lyrical content: that is, the expression of explosive angst and irritability coupled with lingering discomfort and frustration.\\" Songs Opening song \\"Soul on a Rock\\" begins with synths and guitars which \\"combust with energy.\\" \\"Rendevouz\\" has been compared to the new wave band Blondie. \\"Thunder of Hearts\\" features the Japanese proverb \\"even monkeys fall from trees\\"; Shelley said \\"I sometimes buy lots of Japanese books, and there was one which was Japanese proverbs. And that was actually the title of the book, even monkeys fall from trees. It means even the most skillful people can make mistakes.\\" \\"Why Compromise?\\" features a minimalistic electronic drum sound and has been described as an \\"discoid anthem.\\" \\"Don't Let the Car Crash\\" is one of the album's less immediate songs. Mark Caro of The Chicago Tribune described \\"Doesn't Mean Anything\\" as \\"rapping-over-Casiotone.\\" Skate and Annoy said \\"as goofy as the production on ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt Mean Anything‚Äù is, it grows on you.\\" \\"Turn of the Screw\\" is one of the album's examples of Shelley's \\"straight-ahead pop- punk\\" songs. \\"Phone\\" has been compared to the music of Shelley's solo album XL1 (1983). \\"Runaround\\" and \\"Thunder of Hearts\\" are \\"instant singalongs\\" that showcase Shelley's \\"guitar-driven bubble punk.\\" Gigslutz observed that \\"Speed of Life\\" and \\"Don't Let the Car Crash\\" both sport \\"Bowie-esque titles,\\" as David Bowie's electronic-tinged album Low (1977) contained tracks named \\"Speed of Life\\" and \\"Always Crashing in the Same Car\\". When asking Diggle if the band were inspired by him on the album, replied \\"I‚Äôd forgotten 'Speed of Life', it was a little in-joke to me because I was taking a lot of speed at the time! Britpop was underway, lots of crazy parties, hedonistic times, that notion of living your life, too busy to notice what you‚Äôre doing, don‚Äôt always stop and think ‚ÄòWho the fuck am I?\\" He added that \\"Don't let the Car Crash\\" dates from when he was in a car crash when he was 17: \\"my best mate died, we were all a bit drunk going down the road, we‚Äôd been thrown out of a club for dancing with each other, sure they were playing ‚ÄòStarman‚Äô! We got in and the car careered off the road, and I thought ‚ÄòFuck, I‚Äôm gonna die‚Äô, was thrown about everywhere. we ended up in a garage and demolished the petrol pump, we could have all gone up in flames. When I got out my mate was on the floor, I thought he was ok, it seemed to take forever, he‚Äôd died. That changed my life a lot.\\"  Release  As the collapse of I.R.S. Records in July 1996 had left the band without a record deal, the band signed to EMI in the United Kingdom and independent punk rock label Go-Kart Records in the United States. EMI had contacted the band keen to release one of their albums and wanted to know when they could have one, with Barber replying to them \\"we have one done already\\". Upon being given the album in March 1999, EMI were reported to \\"love it already.\\" In the UK, Modern was released by EMI on 6 September 1999 as an LP and as a double CD set; the second disc being the newly compiled greatest hits compilation A Different Kind of Product. This extra disc was an abridged version of the band's anthology box set Product (1989) and contains twelve of the band's early singles as well as an enhanced CD element featuring the music videos for the Modern song \\"Promises\\" and two of the early singles featured on the disc, \\"What Do I Get?\\" and \\"Why She's a Girl from the Chainstore.\\" The enhanced CD also features \\"loads of memorabilia\\", including a multimedia described by one critic as \\"a slide show without commentary and a bad interface\\" and the 1980s I.R.S. video Playback, an \\"excellent\\" video featuring studio and live footage, promotional videos, and TV appearances from Top of the Pops, Jukebox Jury, and \\"some bizarro kids program\\" among others. The album was released in the United States by Go-Kart Records as a single CD and LP a week later on 14 September 1999. It did not feature the bonus disc, but most copies did feature new artwork, featuring a black album cover instead of the stark blue sleeve of the UK release, which was designed by Buzzcocks and The Red Room. Another special edition was released in the US, featuring a pink vinyl. To promote the album in the UK, EMI released Promotional Product, an EP led by two songs from Modern‚Äì\\"Thunder of Hearts\\" and a radio edit of \\"Soul on a Rock\\"‚Äìand completed by the band's 1978 single \\"Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn't've)\\". A music video was also produced for \\"Thunder of Hearts\\". As with previous singles, the band \\"let other people decide\\" that the song would be the first single: \\"We tend to go with the consensus. It seemed a bit arrogant to say that we know better than everyone else. I mean we do.\\" Modern and the EP were not commercial success in either country, but the album saw steady sales due to the band's supporting tour. Pending contractual issues, Modern was belatedly released in early 2000 in Europe and Japan. Critical reception  Critical response to Modern was mostly positive. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic was favourable and rated the album three stars out of five, saying that although \\"Diggle's songs sound a little weaker than Pete Shelley's\\" due to their electronic influence, Modern is a \\"minor triumph\\" that proves that \\"the Buzzcocks not only sound better than any of their punk peers on Modern, they sound better than most of the young punk revivalists. And at the very least, that's somewhat noteworthy.\\" Antek Pistole of Ox Fanzine said the band \\"still write great songs\\" and said that although the album might not appeal to fans of 1977 punk rock, it would appeal to Buzzcocks fans. Kilwag of Skate and Annoy was very favourable, \\"Modern is a very good record. If the Buzzcocks were a new band this record would probably be getting lots of press, hype, and promotion. Let‚Äôs hope that enough people buy it so that Pete (Well Steve) doesn‚Äôt feel it necessary to sell the rights to Autonomy to Microsoft.\\" Robert Christgau quipped that Modern showed the band \\"looking for the same new love with the same new tunes\\" and rated it a \\"three-star honorable mention\\", indicating \\"an enjoyable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well treasure.\\" In a very favourable review, Wilson Neate of Westnet said that \\"during its finest moments, Modern reminds us that the Buzzcocks' significant contributions are often unfairly overshadowed by a tendency to look no further than the Sex Pistols or The Clash for a blueprint of British punk. The Pistols wrote the book on punk-as-situation / style / shock, while the Clash covered the political angle, but the Buzzcocks (along with Wire) took punk beyond the gesture and the pose and left perhaps the most substantial and enduring musical legacy.\\" He concluded \\"so, to plagiarize a question asked by Pete Shelley quite a few years ago, \\"what do I get\\" from Modern? Quite a lot actually. During its best moments--\\"Soul on a Rock\\", Rendezvous,\\" \\"Runaround,\\" \\"Choices,\\" \\"Why Compromise\\" and \\"Under the Sun\\"‚Äîthis album is vintage Buzzcocks. And what more could you ask for?\\" Joshua Klein of The A.V. Club, on the other hand, wrote \\"the band reunited in time to ride the new punk wave, but something was missing from its two capable comeback albums. The new Modern is something else entirely: Essentially picking up where the band left off in 1981, the ironically-titled disc sounds like it was recorded just as punk turned into new wave\\", calling it \\"retro in the best sense\\". The album had some mixed and negative reviews. Michael Sandlin of Pitchfork rated the album 3.5/10 and called it \\"wholly ill-conceived and mind-numbingly dull\\" and that \\"[it] seems like a weak attempt by a once-great band to simply sound 'current', whatever that means.\\" Mark Caro of Chicago Tribune said \\"catchiness without urgency equals something, but vintage Buzzcocks it ain't.\\" David Daley of the Hartford Courant said \\"The Buzzcocks' caffeinated punk-pop of two decades ago was fueled by teenage angst and desire, and of their contemporaries, perhaps only the Undertones did it better. Now, it's not that angst ever disappears. But there's still something tragic about singer/songwriter Pete Shelley's attempts to milk those now long-dried wells on Modern, as his helium-voice laments the return to fast cars, watched phones that don't ring and misbegotten romances.\\" Legacy In his 2012 book The Anarchy Tour, music writer Mick O'Shea said that alongside the band's other post-reunion albums, Modern \\"served to affirm that Buzzcocks could still appeal to a global audience while still remaining true to their original ideals.\\" whilst music writer Colin Larkin rated the album three stars out of five in the fifth edition of The Encyclopedia of Popular Music (2011), saying that alongside All Set, it \\"confirmed the Buzzcocks' latter-day renaissance.\\" Alongside All Set, it has been said that Modern \\"reaffirmed Buzzcocks' position as a band deeply loved and revered by a global audience, simultaneously true to their original ideals and open to new ideas.\\" Regardless, in The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Modern is rated with two stars out of five and is described as \\"plastic new wave.\\" Skate and Annoy said that \\"each time you listen to Modern it gets better and better.\\"  Track listing  All songs written and composed by Pete Shelley, except where noted.

As a physician he seems to have enjoyed quite a reputation, but he is better known as a Hebrew grammarian. He appears to have become a man of wealth in later years, for he published at his own expense numerous grammatical works. Thus in 1529 he published Ibn Ezra's \\"Yesod Mora,\\" and in 1530 the work \\"Sefat Yeter\\" by the same author.

It consists of three chapters upon the interpretation of dreams and upon the averting of evil dreams, and was first published in Salonica, about 1516 (link to .pdf file here). It was republished in 1518 in Constantinople, then later in Cracow; was printed in Amsterdam by Manasseh ben Israel (link to .pdf file here), and in 1694 appeared in a Jud√¶o-German translation. *He also wrote a philosophical treatise upon the nature of the soul and its immortality, entitled Sha'ar ha-Shem he-·∏§adash, Constantinople, 1533.

The screenplay by Wagner and Fred Parnes is based on the novel of the same name by Brian Morton. Plot Now aging and ailing, the one-time celebrated author Leonard Schiller has been forgotten by his readers, literary colleagues, and critics during the decade he has struggled to complete what he knows will be his final novel. When the brash, ambitious Brown University graduate student Heather Wolfe approaches him with a request for access to his thoughts and recollections for the Master's thesis she hopes will reintroduce the public to his work, he initially refuses to cooperate. But the young woman is relentless, and he finally agrees to weekly meetings in which he slowly begins to open up to her as he reluctantly recalls his past. Slightly suspicious of Heather's motives is Leonard's daughter Ariel, a former professional dancer who supports herself by teaching yoga and Pilates. Rapidly approaching forty, Ariel has stopped using birth control with her boyfriend Victor without telling him about her determination to have a baby. When he learns about her plan, she ends their relationship; at the same time, Ariel's former lover Casey Davis returns to New York City after a five-year absence. He and Ariel had reached an impasse in their relationship because of his refusal to have a child, and as they begin to see each other again, he is quick to let her know his position hasn't changed. The film focuses on these four individuals and their evolution as they are thrust out of their comfort zones and into arenas that force them to examine their lives and decide how much they are willing to compromise and sacrifice their own desires in order to accommodate the demands of others.

It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival, the Edmonton International Film Festival, the Mill Valley Film Festival, the Austin Film Festival, the Hamptons International Film Festival, the Virginia Film Festival, and the Denver Film Festival before opening on seven screens in the US on November 23, 2007. It grossed $76,214 on its opening weekend and eventually earned $898,786 in the U.S. Critical reception Rotten Tomatoes reported 86% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 92 reviews, while Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 78 out of 100, based on 33 reviews. A.O. Scott of The New York Times observed, \\"Even though it is less populous than Mr. Morton‚Äôs novel . . . the adaptation . . . rarely feels unduly claustrophobic or rarefied. Allusions and incidents that evoked the milieu of Leonard‚Äôs younger days, and the texture of his mind, have been pruned away. But in their place is the marvelous fact of Mr. Langella, who carries every nuance of Leonard‚Äôs experience ‚Äî including his prodigious, obsessive reading ‚Äî in his posture and his pores . . . And what is so remarkable about [him] is that he seems to hold Leonard‚Äôs intellectual cosmos inside him, to make it implicit in the man‚Äôs every gesture and pause.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times rated the film four out of four stars and commented, \\"The movie is carefully modulated to draw us deeper and deeper into the situation, and uses no contrived plot devices to superimpose plot jolts on what is, after all, a story involving four civilized people who are only trying, each in a different way, to find happiness.\\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said the original novel's appeal was in \\"the simple but elegant prose and in the way Morton lets us see into the thought processes of his characters. Neither of those elements translates into a visual medium, and so anyone adapting this novel was sure to face a challenge. Unfortunately, director and co-writer Andrew Wagner compounds the difficulty by wallowing in the story's bleakness and settling for sentimental gestures from his actors. Frank Langella is the single big exception on the acting score . . . Starting Out in the Evening has the feeling of a film in which the actors, left to direct themselves, played into their own self-indulgent instincts, and the only one who resisted was the old pro who knew better.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called the film \\"remarkable\\" and said \\"Langella delivers a master class in acting [with a] deeply felt portrait of a lion in winter.\\" Meghan Keane of The New York Sun stated, \\"The glowing accolades that the filmmakers attempt to bestow on the novelist Brian Morton ultimately result in an undercooked product . . . [T]he film is unable to re-create the delicate balance of emotions that Mr. Morton created in his book of the same name. The deference to [his] work is clear throughout the picture, but the interactions between the characters often fail to realize the soft sentiment that his novel achieved.\\" Scott Foundas of Variety called the film \\"a wise, carefully observed chamber drama,\\" a \\"small yet deeply resonant pic,\\" and \\"a sophomore film of unusual maturity and confidence ‚Äì the work of a filmmaker with a sure grasp of his characters.\\" Critics for The Washington Post, the New York Times, and the Baltimore Sun cited the film as one of the ten best of the year. Awards and nominations Frank Langella won the Boston Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actor and was nominated for the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor, the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor, the Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead, and the Satellite Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama. Andrew Wagner and Fred Parnes were nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Screenplay.

New (1924‚Äì1944), who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for \\"selfless conduct\\" in the Battle of Peleliu. New was laid down on 14 April 1945 by the Consolidated Steel Corp., Orange, Texas; launched on 18 August 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Barbara Julien, sister of PFC John New; and commissioned on 5 April 1946, Commander M. S. Schmidling in command. Service history 1946-1958 Following a Caribbean shakedown and type training off the East Coast, New got underway for the Mediterranean on 8 August 1946. During the first week of September she cruised off the coast of Greece with the aircraft carrier , providing weight to American diplomatic efforts to assure Greek citizens the right of self- determination in the 1 September plebiscite which returned King George II to the throne and reinforced their previously recorded (31 March 1946) repudiation of the Communist Party and its supporters, who were then engaged in guerrilla activities. Her mission, a precursor to the Truman Doctrine, completed, New joined Task Group 125.4 (TG 125.4), then operating with British warships in the Adriatic to prevent any outbreak of hostilities between Italy and Yugoslavia over Trieste. On 8 February 1947, New got underway for the United States, where, after overhaul, she commenced three years of employment in type training and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) exercises from Key West to the Davis Strait. In 1949 and 1950 she added midshipman training cruises to that schedule. On 9 September 1950, New, now DDE-818 (effective 4 March 1950), departed her homeport of Norfolk, Virginia, for a month-long NATO exercise in the Mediterranean. On her return she resumed local operations with her squadron which on 1 January 1951 became Escort Destroyer Squadron 4 (CortDesRon 4). For the next six years New, a unit of the Atlantic Fleet's Destroyer Force, continued to rotate tours in the Mediterranean with duty in the Western Atlantic. Assigned to the same fleet's antisubmarine force in April 1956, she conducted her third midshipman training cruise the following summer and, in July, became flagship of DesRon 36\\\\. On 8 May 1958, New departed Hampton Roads for her eighth tour with the 6th Fleet. During this extended Mediterranean deployment she participated in 6th Fleet operations in response to Lebanese President Camille Chamoun's request for aid in countering a coup against his regime. One of the first ships on the spot, she patrolled Beirut Straits awaiting word to evacuate American nationals if it became necessary. 1962-1968 1962 brought another break in News regular schedule of operations. Reclassified DD‚Äì818 once again, on 30 June, she trained midshipmen during the summer and in the fall was called on to participate in the Cuban quarantine. Departing Norfolk on 26 October she was engaged in ASW screening and surface vessel surveillance as a unit of Task Group Bravo until 20 November. Then, quitting the Caribbean, New returned to Norfolk where she underwent availability and upkeep prior to entering the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for a Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) Mark I conversion, during which she received the ASROC system. On 7 December 1963, the modernized New returned to active duty with a new squadron, DesRon 22\\\\. With that squadron she participated in further ASW activities throughout most of 1964, taking time out during the summer to conduct a midshipman training cruise to Europe. On 5 March 1965 she resumed her regular 6th Fleet deployment, adding, on that tour, a new dimension by taking on patrol duties in the vital and volatile Red Sea and Persian Gulf areas to bolster units of the Royal Navy's forces East of Suez. In 1967, News overseas deployment was again shifted to a new area and on 20 June she departed Norfolk for WestPac to support operations in Southeast Asia. On 29 July she arrived at Subic Bay and by 8 August she was at Da Nang, South Vietnam, whence she steamed north to take up duties on the Northern Search and Rescue Station in Tonkin Gulf as a unit of Task Force 77 (TF 77). On 29 September she took up fire support duties off Quang Ngai. There she supported elements of the ROK 2nd Marine Brigade and the 1st Marine Division during \\"Operation Dragon Fire\\", after which she retired from the combat area for a brief R&R; period. On 19 November she returned to Vietnam for further fire support missions south of the DMZ, continuing that role until sailing for home on 1 December to arrive in Hampton Roads on 16 January 1968. Into the summer of 1968, New took part in the search for the ill-fated submarine , after which she prepared for another MidEast deployment. Departing the East Coast on 30 October, the destroyer set a course, necessitated by the closure of the Suez Canal, for Recife, thence around the Cape of Good Hope and into the Indian Ocean. By the end of the year she had called at Louren√ßo Marques, Diego Suarez, and Mombasa, and with the arrival of 1969, she added Djibouti and Bombay to her good-will visits prior to commencing her assigned operations along the coast of the Eurasian heartland. 1969‚Äì1976 In July 1969, New was part of the support fleet for the Apollo 11 moon landing, on station in the launch abort area in the Atlantic Ocean. NASA. Retrieved 27 August 2012 August 1969 saw New in Cape Kennedy, Florida where she participated in DASO operations and also served as sonar school ship for Fleet Sonar School, Key West, Florida. Upon arrival back in her home port on 25 September 1969 New underwent tender availability with and in November 1969 she entered the Norfolk Naval shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia for a period of two weeks to undergo minor repairs. During the period 26 January to 24 February 1970 New acted as a gunfire support ship at Guantanamo bay, Cuba. New returned to Norfolk for upkeep and preparation for Apollo 13 operations in early April. Having earned a Meritorious Unit Commendation for her part in the Apollo 13 recovery force in April 1970 New then returned to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth for a four month overhaul. After her refitting USS New left the shipyard in August 1970 to prepare for refresher training. On 17 September 1970 the ship left Norfolk Naval Base for REFTRA with the fleet training group at Guantanamo Bay. New returned to Norfolk on 10 November 1970 for preparation for her upcoming Mediterranean cruise. New was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 July 1976.

The route is a former section of NY 23 that runs for from NY 9G southwest of Hudson to NY 9H in Claverack-Red Mills. It provides direct access to the city of Hudson from the Rip Van Winkle Bridge whereas NY 23 bypasses it to the south. NY 23B was assigned in the late 1950s after NY 23 was moved onto its current alignment south of Hudson. Route description NY 23B forks from its parent, NY 23, south of the city of Hudson and a half-mile (0.8 km) east of the Rip Van Winkle Bridge in Greenport, Columbia County. The intersection borders the grounds of the Olana State Historic Site and is west of the Columbia-Greene Community College campus. NY 9G, concurrent with NY 23 west of this point, leaves NY 23 to follow NY 23B toward Hudson. The route is the westernmost through route along the Hudson River between the Rip Van Winkle Bridge and Hudson; however, it is separated from the river by Mount Merino, a peak situated above sea level. From NY 23, the two-lane road heads northeast through rural, wooded areas until it reaches the city of Hudson. Along with US 9, NY 23B heads eastbound through Hudson. Upon entering the Hudson city limits, NY 9G and NY 23B change from a state-maintained highway to a locally maintained street as it traverses the marshy South Bay. The routes continue into the commercial downtown district, where they follow Third Street for several blocks to Columbia Street. Here, NY 9G and NY 23B veer east, following Columbia Street through the city to a junction with US 9 at Park Place. NY 9G terminates here; however, NY 23B continues east on Columbia Street, now joined by US 9\\\\. Both routes curve onto Green Street one block later. At Fairview Avenue, US 9 splits from NY 23B and heads north while NY 23B heads southeastward as an independent route for the first time. NY 23B passes out of Hudson and back into Greenport after intersecting the southern terminus of NY 66 at Columbia Street. In Greenport, maintenance of NY 23B reverts to the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). The route remains in Greenport for only , passing residential and industrial neighborhoods on the fringe of the city as it intersects the north end of County Route 29 (Spook Rock Road). Just east of the junction, NY 23B traverses Claverack Creek and crosses into the town of Claverack, where the route initially serves a sparsely developed area between the town line and the hamlet of Claverack-Red Mills. The open fields are gradually replaced by homes as the highway enters Claverack, where NY 23B meets NY 9H and NY 23 at a junction in the center of the community. NY 23B ends here while NY 23 continues east on the route's right-of-way. History When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the portion of NY 23B from Third Street in Hudson to Claverack-Red Mills was designated as part of NY 23\\\\. West of Hudson, NY 23 continued across the Hudson River to Athens by way of a ferry. The Rip Van Winkle Bridge over the Hudson River between Catskill and Greenport was opened to traffic on July 2, 1935; however, NY 23 was not realigned to use the structure until the Athens‚ÄìHudson ferry was shut down in the late 1940s. NY 23 utilized modern NY 23B between the bridge and Hudson. In the late 1950s, NY 23 was realigned between the east end of the bridge and Claverack to follow a new, more southerly alignment via Bell Pond. Its former routing via Hudson was redesignated as NY 23B.

Ilanit also represented Israel twice in the Eurovision Song Contest. In a career spanning over 4 decades, Ilanit recorded and produced over 600 songs and more than 30 best-selling albums. Life and career  Early life and \\"Ilan and Ilanit\\"  In 1947, Ilanit was born in Tel Aviv after her parents migrated from Poland. In 1953, at the age of 5, Ilanit and her family moved to Brazil where they joined a number of South American acts. In 1960, at the age of 13, Ilanit moved back to Israel. In 1962 Ilanit was discovered in a youth talent contest organized by WIZO and the magazine Ma'ariv Youth. Shlomo Zach, an Israeli singer whom she later married, formed a trio that was later known as \\"◊í◊ô◊ì◊ô, ◊¶◊ó ◊ï◊ó◊†◊î\\" (Gidi, Zach, and Hanna). The trio broke down into a duo, consequently renamed \\"Ilan & Ilanit\\". In 1966 the duo's first album was produced, simply named \\"Ilan Ilan\\". Two of their songs, \\"◊ú◊õ◊ú ◊ê◊ì◊ù ◊õ◊ï◊õ◊ë\\" (A star for everyone) and \\"◊ë◊ï◊ê◊ô ◊°◊†◊ô◊ï◊®◊ô◊†◊î\\" (Come, Miss) became hits topping the music charts. The duo became a big success during the 60s in Israel and abroad. Their 1970 hit \\"Veshuv Itchem\\" (\\"With You Again\\" in Hebrew) was covered by Turkish singer ≈ûenay as \\"Sev Karde≈üim\\" (\\"Love my brother/sister\\" in Turkish) in 1971. ≈ûenay became famous with singing this cover.  1970s and a solo career  In 1968 Ilanit released her first solo song, \\"◊õ◊ë◊® ◊ê◊ó◊®◊ô ◊ó◊¶◊ï◊™\\" (kvar acharei chatzot / \\"It's After Midnight\\"). The record came with the song, \\"◊ë◊ï◊ê ◊ï◊†◊©◊™◊í◊¢ ◊ë◊ó◊ï◊ú◊ï◊™\\" (bo ve-nishtage'ah ba-cholot / \\"Let's Go Crazy in the Sands\\") by Ilan & Ilanit. Her first solo performance took place in the 1969 Israeli Song Festival where she sang \\"◊©◊ô◊® ◊ë◊ê◊®◊ë◊¢◊î ◊ë◊™◊ô◊ù\\" (shir b'arbaah batim / \\"Song in Four Verses\\"). While she did not win the competition, the song itself became a big success. In 1973, she first took part in the 1973 Eurovision Song Contest in Luxembourg where she reached the fourth position with the song \\"Ey Sham\\" (\\"Somewhere\\"). This was also the first ever participation of Israel in the Song Contest. The song was composed by Nurit Hirsh, who also conducted the orchestra in Luxembourg on that occasion. It was only the second time that the orchestra was conducted by a woman; the first time was on that very evening (Monica Dominique, \\"You're Summer\\", Sweden). The second participation by Ilanit was in London in 1977 with a song entitled \\"Ahava Hi Shir Lishnayim\\" (\\"Love is a Song for Two\\"). With this song she came eleventh. Ilanit was going to try to represent Israel in the Eurovision for a third time, at the 1984 Eurovision Song Contest. But Israel cancelled its participation in the contest that year due to a conflict with its Memorial Day. Rather than wait a year for the next contest, Ilanit decided to release the song she was going to compete with, \\"Balalaika\\" in 1984. At that time Ilanit was already one of Israel's most popular singers and the song \\"Balalaika\\" became an instant hit, despite not being a Eurovision song entry representing Israel.Balalaika on Yoram Taharlev's web site Ilanit was named Israel's top female singer every year from 1971 to 1977, something no other singer has achieved. In 1974 Ilanit represented Israel at the World Popular Song Festival In Tokyo '74 with the song \\"Shiru Shir Lashemesh\\" (\\"Sing A Song to the Sun\\"). The final was held on 17 November and she came ninth.  1990s and 2000s Ilanit continued to experience major successes in her home country, with songs from lyricist Ehud Manor and others. Together with other established Israeli artists she took part in a tour through North America in 2005. After \\"Brazilian Dream\\", released in 1996, she didn't record a new album for 12 years. In 2008, she emerged from a long hiatus, releasing the album \\"Israelit\\". Since then she has continued to perform occasionally at special events, for example, the Hadassah centennial in October 2012. She also appeared at the opening of the Grand Final of the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest where she performed the chorus of \\"Ey-Sham.\\"  References   External links  * Ilanit interview from Ynetnews Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:Israeli female singers Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants for Israel Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants of 1973 Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants of 1977 Category:People from Tel Aviv Category:Thelma Yellin High School of Arts alumni Category:Israeli people of Polish-Jewish descent ","title":"Ilanit"},{"id":"7081508","text":"K√∂nigshofen may refer to: * Bad K√∂nigshofen (Bad K√∂nigshofen im Grabfeld), a town in Bavaria, Germany * Lauda-K√∂nigshofen, a town in the Main-Tauber district in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany ","title":"K√∂nigshofen"},{"id":"7081524","text":"Crull's Island is a alluvial island in the upper Allegheny River.

She is remembered for her early feminism, and her close relations to dissenting and radical thinkers of her time including Robert Robinson, Mary Wollstonecraft, William Godwin and William Frend. She was born in 1759, into a family of Protestant dissenters who rejected the practices of the Church of England (the established church). Hays was described by those who disliked her as 'the baldest disciple of [Mary] Wollstonecraft' by The Anti Jacobin Magazine, attacked as an 'unsex'd female' by clergyman Robert Polwhele, and provoked controversy through her long life with her rebellious writings. When Hays's fianc√© John Eccles died on the eve of their marriage, Hays expected to die of grief herself. But this apparent tragedy meant that she escaped an ordinary future as wife and mother, remaining unmarried. She seized the chance to make a career for herself in the larger world as a writer. Hays was influenced by Mary Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, and after writing admiringly to her, the two women became friends. The backlash following Wollstonecraft's death and posthumous publication of her Memoirs impacted Hays' later work, which some scholars have called more conservative. Among these later productions is the six-volume compendium Female Biography: or Memoirs of Illustrious and Celebrated Women of All Ages and Countries, in which Wollstonecraft is not mentioned, although Hays had written an extensive obituary for The Annual Necrology shortly after Godwin's controversial Memoirs. If Wollstonecraft was neglected through the nineteenth century, Hays and her writing received even less critical evaluation or academic attention until the twentieth-century's emerging feminist movement.  Early years  Mary Hays was born in London 13 October 1759, the daughter of Rational Dissenters John and Elizabeth Hays. In 1777 she met and fell in love with John Eccles. Their parents initially opposed the match but they met secretly and exchanged over 100 letters. The two were eventually engaged, but in August 1780, Eccles died of a fever. Hays wrote: \\"All my pleasures ‚Äì and every opening prospect are buried with him\\". This spurred her to take up writing. For the next ten years she wrote essays and poems. A short story, \\"Hermit: an Oriental Tale,\\" was published in 1786 in Universal Magazine. It was a picturesque tale that warned against feeling too much passion. She exchanged letters with Robert Robinson, a minister who campaigned against the slave trade. She attended the dissenting academy in Hackney in the late 1780s.  Success in writing  In 1791 she replied to Gilbert Wakefield's critique of communal worship with a pamphlet called Cursory Remarks on An Enquiry into the Expediency and Propriety of Public or Social Worship, using the nom-de-plume Eusebia. The Cambridge mathematician William Frend wrote to her enthusiastically about it. This blossomed into a brief romance. In 1792 Hays was given a copy of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman by Mary Wollstonecraft, and it made a deep impression on her. Hays contacted the publisher of the book, Joseph Johnson, which led to her friendship with Wollstonecraft and involvement with London's Jacobin intellectual circle. Hays next wrote a book Letters and Essays (1793) and invited Mary Wollstonecraft to comment on it before publication. Although the reviews were mixed Hays decided to leave home and to try to support herself by writing. She moved to Hatton Garden. She did not have enough money to buy Enquiry Concerning Political Justice by William Godwin. Boldly she wrote to the author and asked to borrow it. This turned into a friendship, in which Godwin became a guide and teacher. She acted on Wollstonecraft's demand that women take charge of their lives and moved out of her mother's home to live as an independent woman in London. This was an extraordinary and unaccustomed act for a single woman in Hays's time: Hays's mother was horrified, and Hays's friends condemned her. Although Hays's family were outsiders from mainstream British culture, Hays's mother still disapproved of her daughter's social rebellion.  Emma Courtney  Her next work, Memoirs of Emma Courtney (1796) is probably her best-known. Hays's experiment with 'the idea of being free', and her romantic heartbreak over the Frend affair, were its subjects. The novel draws on love letters to William Frend (who was ultimately unreceptive) and includes material taken also from her more philosophical letters in which she debated with William Godwin. The heroine, Emma, falls in love with Augustus Harley, who is the son of a dear friend, but lacking an income. Recognizing that he cannot afford marriage, she offers to live with him as his wife without getting married. Emma tells the Frend figure that her desire for him trumps every other consideration: reputation, status, and even chastity. In the most notorious statement in the book, Emma plays on Frend's name: ‚ÄòMy friend‚Äô, she cries, ‚ÄòI would give myself to you ‚Äì the gift is not worthless‚Äô. In real life and in the novel, Frend rejected Hays. Readers were shocked at her inclusion of real letters she had exchanged with Godwin and Frend. Hays's disgrace was juicy gossip in the close-knit group of London publishing. In 1800 Scottish writer Elizabeth Hamilton published Memoirs of Modern Philosophers, a novel that satirised Hays as a sex-hungry man-chaser, and Hays became a laughingstock throughout Britain.  Later years  Hays and Godwin fell out, and she turned her attention to other writers, including Robert Southey and unfortunately Charles Lloyd. There is no known portrait of her in later life, but Samuel Taylor Coleridge referred to her as \\"a thing ugly and petticoated\\" (although his real complaint was her arguing theology with him). Her next novel The Victim of Prejudice (1799) is more emphatically feminist in its focus on women's secondary status and criticism of class hierarchies. Hays was considered too radical and her book did not sell well. In 1803 Hays demonstrated her continuing concern with women's lives and work, publishing Female Biography, a book in six volumes, containing the lives of 294 women from ancient figures to near contemporaries. Some scholars have argued that by this stage Hays realised that it was dangerous to praise Mary Wollstonecraft, and so omitted her from the book. Others have argued that Hays had little to lose and did not include Wollstonecraft for other reasons‚Äîher stated reason that she was too recently dead, and because she had already written and published a full obituary that should perhaps be considered part of Female Biography. Moving to Camberwell in 1804 thanks to the income from Female Biography, Hays became known to more literary figures of the time, including Charles and Mary Lamb and William Blake. The last 20 years of her life were difficult, with little income and only moderate praise for her work. During this period, she published Memoirs of Queens, Illustrious and Celebrated (1821). In 1824 Hays returned to London where she died in 1843. She is buried at Abney Park Cemetery, Church Street, Stoke Newington, London.  Legacy  Mary Hays is memorialised in the Heritage Floor of Judy Chicago's The Dinner Party, near the place setting for Mary Wollstonecraft. Her letters are held at the New York Public Library, Astor and Tilden Foundation thanks to the work of Dr. Gina Luria Walker.

Burd Grubb) (November 13, 1841 - July 7, 1913) was a Union Army colonel and regimental commander in the American Civil War. He served in three regiments and commanded two of them. In recognition of his service, in 1866, he was nominated and confirmed for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865. He was later appointed by President Benjamin Harrison as United States Ambassador to Spain. He was also a noted foundryman, business owner and New Jersey politician who was close to Woodrow Wilson. Biography Grubb was born in Burlington, New Jersey, to a fourth-generation member of the Grubb Family Iron Dynasty, Edward Burd Grubb Sr. and his wife Euphemia Parker. The Grubb family was descended from John Grubb who came from Cornwall, England and settled in Delaware in the early 1680s. He was educated at Burlington College, later named St. Mary's Hall-Doane Academy and graduated in 1860, just five months before Abraham Lincoln was elected as President. War service In May 1861, he enlisted in the 3rd New Jersey Volunteer Infantry. Commissioned as a first lieutenant, he would ultimately be promoted to Captain and served as an aide to Brig. Gen. George W. Taylor during the 1862 Peninsula Campaign, where he contracted typhoid and was confined to a hospital ship shortly after the Battle of Malvern Hill. He would not rejoin the brigade until shortly before their successful assault on Crampton's Gap, during the lead-up to Battle of Antietam. The VI Corps (ACW) was mostly held in reserve during the battle, though Edward later wrote that his men were convinced they could have finished Lee's army if properly employed. In November 1862, Grubb was promoted to Major, and was transferred to the 23rd New Jersey Volunteer Infantry, a nine-month enlistment unit made up of men from his hometown of Burlington and various parts of Burlington County. In March 1863, despite his youth, he was promoted to Colonel and commander of the regiment when its previous leader, Col. Henry O. Ryerson, left to take command of the 10th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry. He led his regiment, nicknamed \\"The Yahoos\\", as it participated in his brigade's assault on Confederate positions at Salem Church during the May 1863 Battle of Chancellorsville. Wounded in action, he was mustered out when his regiment's enlistment expired by law in June 1863. After a year spent in recruitment and recruit training, Grubb was re-commissioned as colonel and appointed commander of the 37th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry, a 100-day enlistment unit. The new regiment then served in the trenches of Petersburg, Virginia, and in garrison duty until it was mustered out in October 1864. One night after arriving in the trenches, with few arms and little ammunition, the regiment came under fire and took some casualties. Their helplessness in this situation gave rise to the nickname they would bear in the New York Times, \\"Grubb's Game Chickens\\". His younger brother, Parker Grubb, serving as the 37th New Jersey's regimental adjutant, died of disease during the regiment's service. In recognition of his service, on July 9, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Grubb for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, for \\"gallant and meritorious services during the war\\" and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on July 23, 1866. Post war After mustering out later in 1865, Grubb returned to Burlington and established himself as a prominent iron manufacturer, taking over the family's business that went back to his great great grandfather, Peter Grubb Jr. He was president of the Lebanon Valley Furnace Company from 1867 until about 1911. In 1868, he married Elizabeth Wadsworth Van Rensselaer (1848‚Äì1886), daughter of an important family in the area. Together they had one daughter. He was elected to the Burlington City Council where he served as its president for two years. He and his wife found time to travel extensively in Europe and accompanied Baron de Lesseps through the Suez Canal. His 1869 account of the canal and its technical aspects was the first such article to be published in the United States. In 1872, he had fellow veteran Frank Furness design a house on the river, still known as \\"Grubb Cottage\\".\\"Grubb Cottage\\", at 46 Riverbank Street in Burlington, was for sale in Spring 2010. Philadelphia Inquirer, April 2, 2010, p. E-4. In 1874, he built a estate at Edgewater Park Township, New Jersey, called \\"Grassmere\\", where he annually entertained the survivors of the 23rd regiment. In February 1874, Grubb was elected into the First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry (an independent Company of the PA National Guard that had once been George Washington's personal bodyguard during the American Revolution). He was elected as the 16th Captain of the Troop, a position in which he served for 14 years with a break during his foray into politics. This period saw many critical reforms of the National Guard structure that helped ensure an effective mobilization and deployment for World War One. He resigned from the troop in 1896, but later regretted the decision and requested a commission as a colonel in the Expeditionary Force that went to Cuba in 1898. Grubb was also a colonel in the New Jersey National Guard. His main contribution came during the 1881 centennial celebration of the Siege of Yorktown, where he commanded the New Jersey regiment that won a ceremonial silver cup for being the best drilled unit. He stayed active in veterans affairs, serving as New Jersey Department Commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, as well as hosting the annual reunions of his veterans. Grubb was on a safari in Africa when his wife died in 1886. Upon his return, he proposed to his longtime friend, Harriet Hubbard Ayer, the noted woman's rights activist who made a fortune manufacturing beauty creams. However, she declined his proposal. Political career Portrait of General E. Burd Grubb (1898) by Thomas Eakins, now in the collection of Yale University. In 1889, Republicans nominated for Grubb for governor, hoping that the war hero could beat Leon Abbett, a popular former governor. During that year's convention, Grubb broke with tradition and addressed the gathering to thank them for his nomination. In his campaign, he called for ballot reform to break the power of the political machines. While Abbett was expected to easily beat the political novice, the election was close except in Hudson County where that county's machine did not take any chances. For example, more votes were counted in Jersey City's Irish wards than registered voters. Sixty-nine election workers were convicted of fraud and sent to prison. Abbett was still declared the winner even though his entire statewide margin came from Hudson, which sent a large delegation to the inauguration to remind the new Governor of that fact. In the hall, they even placed a banner that read \\"Hudson 13,515\\", referring to Abbett's margin from the county. When Abbett used his speech to call for ballot reform himself, a breeze caused the banner to fold and obscure the margin of victory. Senator Wertz was observed to exclaim \\"See!\\", as he pointed to the banner, \\"See how Abbett's majority shrinks as he advocates ballot reform.\\" Also that year, Benjamin Harrison had been inaugurated as President and selected a friend of Grubb, James G. Blaine, as secretary of state. Blaine arranged for Grubb to be one of Harrison's seven appointees to the 1890 Board of Visitors to West Point Military Academy; he was elected vice president. Among other things, his committee suggested the purchase of the Academy's first Hotchkiss gun. Blaine then arranged for Grubb to be appointed as Ambassador to Spain. During his term, he negotiated a trade reciprocity treaty. In 1892, he resigned and returned to New Jersey. Grubb remained politically active and left the Republican Party to become a reformer. He lost an election for Congress in 1908. He later actively campaigned for Woodrow Wilson when he ran for Governor two years later. Wilson and Grubb became close and the Governor often stayed at Grubb's home on the river. Later years While in Spain, Grubb met Violet Sopwith (1865‚Äì1958), the daughter of an English mining engineer working in Spain. Violet's younger brother was Thomas Sopwith, who would later become a famous aviation pioneer. Burd and Violet married before their return to New Jersey and would go on to have three children, although one died young. Their son, Edward Burd Grubb III was the President of the New York Curb Exchange during the critical period after the creation of the SEC. Burd was especially interested in the family's history and met with his distant cousin, Delaware Supreme Court Justice Ignatius Cooper Grubb, who was the family's historian during the period. The General made national news in 1908-1909 after meeting the commander of the 8th Alabama Regiment. Two units that once met as enemies at Salem Church, met again as friends at the \\"Yahoos Reunion\\" at Grubb's Grassmere estate. In 1911, Grubb lost his fortune due to a bad investment and was appointed by then Governor Wilson as Superintendent of the New Jersey Home for Disabled Soldiers in Kearney, New Jersey. He died in Newark, New Jersey, and was buried in Saint Mary's Episcopal Churchyard in Burlington.The ornate monuments to Grubb's father and brother in St. Mary's Churchyard are attributed to architect Frank Furness. George E. Thomas, et al., Frank Furness: The Complete Works (New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 1996) p. 154. Violet moved back to \\"Grubb Cottage\\", then owned by Grubb's brother. During the First World War, Violet chaired the British Emergency Aid Committee in Philadelphia and later retired to Maryland to live with her daughter.

Village of Bommenede  Bommenede was founded in the early 12th century by monks of the Cistercian monastery of Ter Duinen in Flanders. It was located on one of the four islands that later joined up to form the current island of Schouwen-Duiveland. The name was first mentioned in 1165, as insula Bomne. The island was a part of Holland, because the boundary between Holland and Zeeland lay in the Sonnemere, the water south of Bommenede. According to the 19th-century historian A.J. van der Aa, John of Bavaria ordered the construction of dykes around the island in 1412, creating the polder of Bommenede. The village of Bommenede was listed in 1153 as property of the Cistercian monastery of Ter Duinen in Flanders. The village survived two floods in 1530 and 1532 and a fire in 1540. In 1570, Bommenede and the neighbouring polder \\"Kijkuit\\" were flooded during the All Saints' Flood. The siege of Bommenede (1575) Because of the strategic location of the village, a defensive wall was built around it in 1574. The following year, the Spanish commander Mondragon besieged it for 20 days, and shot the village to pieces. At the end of the siege, no more than 20 healthy men survived in the village. The village was flooded again on January 26, 1682. The destruction was so great, that the Estates of Holland decided not to rebuild the village, and the last inhabitants left in 1684. Some remains of the village (now sometimes referred to as Oud-Bommenede) remained visible for years. Nowadays, there is still some overgrown debris in the waters of the Grevelingen. Nieuw-Bommenede Part of the former island was reclaimed from the sea in 1701. In the southern part of the new polder, a new hamlet grew: Nieuw- Bommenede. In the middle of the 19th century, it had about 410 inhabitants. The municipality of Bommenede in 1866 Bommenede was a separate heerlijkheid, and later a separate municipality (also called \\"Bommenede en Bloois\\"), until it was merged with the municipality of Zonnemaire on January 4, 1866.

Vacuum Science & Technology: Pioneers of the 20th Century He was commissioned by Sears Roebuck to paint a series of portraits of its founders and officers, and many of his portraits still are displayed in the Sears Tower in Chicago. Montgomery painted similar portraits for companies such as Allstate and Motorola, and for heads of hospitals and universities. Montgomery's most famous and most widely viewed portrait is probably that which he was commissioned to do of University of Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne in the 1930s. The portrait remains in the University collection in South Bend, Indiana. Montgomery also painted anonymous portraits, such as Woman with Mandolin, which hangs prominently in the guest house of Oprah Winfrey. 'O' At Home, Fall 2005 Another notable work, a portrait of Motorola founder Paul Galvin, hangs today in the Crerar Library (now the Galvin Library) of the Illinois Institute of Technology. Besides portraits, Montgomery gained national recognition for his large murals. Sears hired him to paint murals for many of its stores around the country, typically showing scenes from local history. His first such mural was for a store in Houston in 1939. His last known mural, for Allstate Insurance in Chicago in the 1950s, depicted the history of the automobile age. The unveiling of Montgomery's 70' mural of Mecklenburg County at the grand opening of the new Sears store in Charlotte, North Carolina in 1949, one of a series of 12 commissioned by Sears, was a major event, and when the store was eventually torn down, the mural was relocated to South Mecklenburg High School in 1970. In 1942, Montgomery was featured in the Art Institute of Chicago's exhibition of prize-winning Chicago-area artists.Art Institute of Chicago News Releases for 1942 Some of his work is also on display at the Covenant United Methodist Church in Evanston. Montgomery painted and taught until he was 85, working out of his home studio in Skokie, Illinois.

It is very near to Bishop's Waltham. Swanmore was originally set up to provide homes for workers in local brickworks. As such, the houses in the village are mainly early- and mid-Victorian brick buildings, although there are some older houses, especially in the hamlet of Upper Swanmore 1/4 mile north of the main village. The village continued to thrive after the closure of these brickworks, and at one time had many shops and services in the village, however many of these closed with the advent of easier transport to nearby towns, but Swanmore does still have a village shop, post office, butcher and hairdresser. Hill Place is a grade II listed Georgian country villa located in the parish. Churches The church, St Barnabas was built when the village gained independence in the 19th century, whereas before it was part of the parish of Droxford. With its independence Swanmore gained its own resident priest and parsonage. As well as St Barnabas, Swanmore has a Methodist chapel which was built in 1863. The Paterson centre, which was built to replace the old parish room, was built in the late 1980s and named after retired Swanmore vicar Rev. Ron Paterson and in remembrance of the three members of his family who died while he was serving the parish. Education Swanmore houses the schools Swanmore Primary School (a Church of England aided school) and Swanmore College, which is the secondary school for neighbouring towns and villages. The nearest major town is Fareham, six miles south. Swanmore also has two pre-schools, Swanmore Pre-School and the Greenery.

She was also convicted of the manslaughter of her fourth child, Caleb Gibson (at age nineteen days). The murders took place between 1989 and 1999. She was exposed when her husband discovered her personal diary, which detailed the killings and contacted the Police. Folbigg was originally sentenced to forty years' imprisonment, with a non-parole period of thirty years, but on appeal this was reduced to thirty years, with a non-parole period of twenty-five years. She maintains her innocence, claiming the four children died from natural causes. Results from genetic analysis that was presented 19 August 2020 indicated that the cause of deaths was natural causes due to mutation called CALM2. Early life On 8 January 1969, Kathleen Folbigg's biological father, Thomas John \\"Taffy\\" Britton, murdered her mother, Kathleen May Donovan, by stabbing her twenty- four times. Following her father's arrest on the day after the murder, Folbigg was made a ward of the state and placed into foster care with a couple. On 18 July 1970, she was removed from their care and placed into Bidura Children's Home.. Two months later, Folbigg moved into a permanent foster care placement. This arrangement lasted until she was a young adult. She left school at the age of fifteen, and married Craig Gibson Folbigg in 1987. Deaths Caleb Gibson Caleb Gibson Folbigg, born on 1 February 1989, was known to breathe noisily and was diagnosed by a paediatrician to be suffering from a mild case of laryngomalacia, something he would eventually outgrow; he was otherwise born healthy. On 20 February, Folbigg put Caleb to sleep in a room adjoining the bedroom she shared with her husband. During the night, Caleb stirred from midnight until 2 a.m. Found by Folbigg, the death was attributed to cot death. Patrick Allen Patrick Allen Folbigg was born on 3 June 1990. Craig remained at home to help care for his wife and baby for three months after the birth. On 18 October, Folbigg put Patrick to bed. Craig was awakened by the sounds of his wife screaming and found her standing at the baby's cot. He noticed the child wasn't breathing and attempted to revive him by cardiopulmonary resuscitation. An ambulance was called and Patrick was taken to hospital. He would later be diagnosed to be suffering from epilepsy and cortical blindness. On 18 February 1991, Folbigg telephoned her husband at work to report Patrick's death, saying \\"It's happened again!\\" Sarah Kathleen Following their second loss, the couple moved to Thornton, New South Wales, a suburb of Maitland. Sarah Kathleen Folbigg was born on 14 October 1992, and died on 29 August 1993. Laura Elizabeth In 1996, the couple moved to Singleton. On 7 August 1997, Laura Elizabeth Folbigg was born. On 27 February 1999, Laura died. Justice system Trial Folbigg's trial lasted seven weeks. The prosecution alleged Folbigg murdered her four children by smothering them during periods of frustration. During a jury replay of Folbigg's police interview, she attempted to run from the courtroom. The defense made the case that Folbigg did not kill or harm her children and that she did not think that Craig was responsible either. Although prosecution witnesses were concerned about the lack of prodromal (early-warning) symptoms in any of the children, the defence posed natural explanations for the events such as cot death and, in the case of Laura's death, myocarditis. The defence highlighted that Folbigg was a caring mother, pointing to journal entries that showed the care and concern that she gave her children. Some of her acquaintances gave statements to investigators about her caring nature. The defense pointed out that there were no direct admissions to the killings in Folbigg's journal entries, and that any entries indirectly suggesting her responsibility could be chalked up to a typical grieving mother's guilt. Folbigg appeared genuinely distraught to ambulance and police responders to the scene. They pointed out that no physical evidence could link Folbigg to murder; it was an entirely circumstantial case with very little consensus among the scientific experts who testified at trial. Verdict On 21 May 2003, Folbigg was found guilty by the Supreme Court of New South Wales jury of the following crimes: three counts of murder, one count of manslaughter and one count of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm. On 24 October 2003, Folbigg was sentenced to forty years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of thirty years. Appeal On 17 February 2005, the court reduced her sentence to thirty years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of twenty-five years on appeal. Due to the nature of her crimes, Folbigg resides in protective custody to prevent possible violence by other inmates. Judicial inquiry On 22 August 2018, New South Wales Attorney-General Mark Speakman announced there would be an inquiry into the convictions, to \\"ensure public confidence in the administration of justice\\". It was in response to a petition presented by her supporters. \\"The petition appears to raise a doubt or question concerning the evidence as to the incidence of reported deaths of three or more infants in the same family attributed to unidentified natural causes in the proceedings leading to Ms Folbigg's convictions,\\" he said. However, in the 500-page report, released in July 2019, a former chief judge of the District Court found he did not have \\"any reasonable doubt as to the guilt of Kathleen Megan Folbigg for the offences of which she was convicted\\". Folbigg's legal team promptly requested a further judicial review of her case citing \\"bias\\" during the inquiry. However, Justice Reginald Blanch found the inquiry reinforced her guilt. Despite being warned by the judge she couldn't rerun the inquiry that reiterated her guilt, in August 2020, Folbigg's legal team launched legal action against Justice Blanch and NSW Attorney-General Mark Speakman in a yet another bid to prove Folbigg's innocence. The matter is next in court on 28 August 2020.

Originally called The Mods, their largest commercial success came with the release of their first single \\"It's Cold Outside\\" in December 1966. The song, considered to be a classic of the garage rock era, was featured on Pebbles, Volume 2, one of the earlier garage rock compilation LPs (issued in 1979). The flipside, \\"I'm Going Home\\" was included as a bonus track when the Pebbles album was reissued as a CD, and it can also be found on a garage rock compilation LP on Ohio bands, Highs in the Mid-Sixties, Volume 9. The Choir is well known for containing three of the four original members of Raspberries (all except lead singer Eric Carmen). History of the band The first bandleader of The Choir, Dann Klawon (also called Dan Klawon or Danny Klawon) discovered Beatlemania in late 1963 before most of his peers, since a girl he knew had been to England and brought back a copy of the Beatles' first single, \\"Love Me Do\\" and one of their early albums (probably With the Beatles) before their release in the U.S.Rock 'N' Roll and the Cleveland Connection by Deanna R. Adams, 2002: Kent State University Press, pp. 153-154 (from Google Book Search). The book quotes Klawon as saying that the album was Meet the Beatles, but this was a U.S.-only release. Within months, he had organized a band with three of his friends who all attended Mentor High School in Mentor, Ohio. Dann Klawon began as the drummer for the band, Dave Smalley and Dan Heckel were the guitarists, and Tom Boles served as lead singer. (Randy Klawon, Dann's brother, did not officially join the band until 1968; but he filled in on drums for one concert in 1966 when he was just 14).Rock 'N' Roll and the Cleveland Connection by Deanna R. Adams, 2002: Kent State University Press, pp. 153-156 (from Google Book Search) They called themselves The Mods, and again, Klawon was ahead of his time: although Mod was established in England by the late 1950s, the British band that is most often identified as \\"mod\\" in the U.S. is The Who, which was formed in the same year as The Mods. Soon, The Choir had subtracted Heckel and Boles and added Dave Burke on bass, Wally Bryson on guitar, and Jim Bonfanti on drums; while Klawon moved to the rhythm guitar post. Klawon recalls: So we began playing songs by the Beatles, the Who, Stones, Zombies, Troggs, and Moody Blues. If they were from England, we played it. We had this song list that was unbelievable... And everybody alternated instruments, depending on what song. We'd have that written on [index] cards, as to who played what on what song. In the summer of 1966, the band traveled to Chicago, where they recorded their first single with \\"It's Cold Outside\\" (written by bandleader Dann Klawon) on the \\"A\\" side, which was originally released on Canadian-American Records. According to Klawon: I used to write quite a bit then, and one day I was thinking of some sort of theme to use with the moon/spoon, boy/girl lyrics. I decided to go with a weather analogy. While there, they discovered that a Chicago band called The Modernaires had shortened their name to The Mods, so they renamed themselves The Choir. The song was hugely popular in Cleveland and topped the Cleveland charts for six weeks; the song did quite well throughout the Midwest, particularly after the re-release of the single on Roulette Records in early 1967. By the spring of 1967, \\"It's Cold Outside\\" peaked at No. 68 on the Billboard Charts and at No. 55 on the Cash Box charts, and it even made the CHUM Charts in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. (The record peaked at #25 on the local chart of CKLW in Windsor, Ontario as well). Not long after the single was recorded, however, Dann Klawon and Dave Burke left the band; and a succession of line-up changes ensued. Ironically, considering that he would later front the Raspberries with three core members of the band, Eric Carmen's audition to join The Choir did not go well; Kenny Margolis was selected instead.Online posting on Scarlet Fever and related bands Carmen had been a major fan in the band's early years and was hurt by the rejection; not long after he joined Cyrus Erie, Carmen lured former Choir guitarist Wally Bryson to his new band, and they soon eclipsed The Choir as the most popular local band. The band's second and third singles did not have the same success as their first, and in the spring of 1968, The Choir disbanded. The Choir reformed in late 1968 ‚Äì for the second time, with the bandleader also being the drummer (Jim Bonfanti) ‚Äì and regained much of their earlier popularity in the local scene. According to Denny Carleton: The new Choir's repertoire encompassed jazz, R&B;, ballads and classical rock, and about 20 original songs. The group had an unusual keyboard-dominated sound, sometimes even using three keyboards on songs like \\"MacArthur Park\\" and Traffic's \\"Colored Rain\\". While other bands were simply performing standard tunes by The Beatles, Stones and Who, etc., The Choir was attempting projects of some magnitude, like taking \\"MacArthur Park\\", which was written for full orchestra, and rearranging it for three keyboards, bass, drums and guitar, or performing a 7-minute concerto with four time changes. In 1969, the band returned to the studio and recorded a planned album that had a more psychedelic flavor, with eight original songs and a cover of a song by the Kinks. The tape was shipped to several different record labels without success. After releasing a final unsuccessful single on Intrepid Records in 1970 ‚Äì including a cover of a song by the Easybeats as the \\"A\\" side, \\"Gonna Have a Good Time Tonight\\" (which was a hit song for INXS many years later) ‚Äì the band broke up for good. Musical highlights The jewel in The Choir's catalogue is unquestionably \\"It's Cold Outside\\", the A-side of their first single (although the single's B-side, \\"I'm Goin' Home\\" also has avid fans). The song was originally issued on the Canadian-American Records label in September 1966 but didn't take off until being leased to Roulette Records several months later. \\"It's Cold Outside\\" is a wonderful example of early power pop and, unlike many garage rock classics, is unabashedly Beatlesque, with fine songwriting and strong harmonies. One of the few covers of \\"It's Cold Outside\\" was released by Stiv Bators in 1979, the same year that the song was reissued on the Pebbles, Volume 2 LP. Although it had been a long-time favorite of Bators,Liner notes, L.A. L.A.. the punk band the Dead Boys ‚Äì which he had fronted earlier in the decade ‚Äì had wanted to record their own version but were unable to figure out how to play it.Liner notes, Pebbles, Volume 2 LP. Due to the band's shifting line-up over the years, their remaining songs are varied in style and (according to some) somewhat uneven in quality. Don Krider, in a long article on The Choir, dubbed \\"I'd Rather You Leave Me\\" (written by Wally Bryson) \\"Raspberries '67 ‚Äì it's that good!\\" Phil Giallombardo's song, \\"Anyway I Can\\" is compared favorably with the Left Banke's \\"Walk Away Renee\\"; while the Denny Carleton song, \\"If These are Men\\" is termed \\"a wild, psychedelic '60s track (we're talking potential \\"Austin Powers\\" material here).\\"Posting on E-pinions.com. Other bands that have connections to The Choir Besides competing head-to-head, Cleveland bands were frequently luring talented musicians from other groups in order to improve their sound. This is as true of The Choir as of any other band in the Cleveland area in that time period; as one reviewer put it: \\"The Choir turnstile saw the entrance and exit of a number of Cleveland's best musicians, including Dave Burke, Jim Skeen, Bob McBride, Randy Klawon, Rick Caon, Denny Carleton and Jim Anderson.\\"Epinions.com entry on The Choir, by Don Krider. Also, nearly every information source on the band cites a different list of musicians that had been in the group, and it would likely be impossible to follow each permutation of bandmembers over the entire history of The Choir. However, some of the threads in the \\"family tree\\" of The Choir are outlined below, showing the other bands that the musicians in the group joined at one time or another. There are other connections that are not included in the list given below. For example, prior to joining the James Gang, Joe Walsh was the third member of Pie (with Phil Giallombardo and Jim Bonfanti) and the third member of the Power Trio (with Dann Klawon and Dave Burke). Another of Dann Klawon's projects was his band Peter Panic (1974-1980). They played locally including: the Stables in Painsville, The Library on Prospect ave in Cleveland, the Pirates Cove, the Cleveland Agora & Hennessy's in Lakewood. The Original Band featured many local musicians including founding members Steve Doman (lead vocals), Randy Klawon (Dann's brother) on lead gtr., Dan Klawon on bass, Dave Thomas (2nd gtr.& vocals), and Todd Weaver on drums. After Doman left Peter Panic, Dave Thomas took over lead vocals and they were joined by Wally Bryson (Choir & Raspberries) and Rick Bell on sax (the Cleveland Horn, a.k.a. Michael Stanley, Lou Reed) Much like the Choir, various members left the band but returned during the course of the band's lifetime. The original Peter Panic performed covers of British rock while also covering many Motown and R&B; classics, which made them a popular dance band in NE Ohio. They also opened up for recently-gone-solo Eric Carmen at the old Agora. Also opened up for Ted Nugent at the Allen Theater. A few line-up changes later Peter Panic were headlining at the Cleveland Agora, January 1980, recorded by Agency Recording, and produced by Walt Maskey for his local M105 Radio presentation \\"HOME GROWN\\". The Agora show showcased many Dann Klawon originals, incl: RESTLESS & I LOST YOUR LOVE. It is unknown if any studio material was ever released from Peter Panic. The original group recorded an album for Epic in 1975 which has never been released. In 1977, minus Dave Thomas, who had moved to California, the remaining 3 original members backed Steve Doman on his single release of \\"Perennial Punk,\\" a tongue-in-cheek critique of the burgeoning punk music scene. * Dave Smalley ‚Äì Raspberries, Dynamite, The Secret, solo artist. * Wally Bryson ‚Äì Raspberries, Cyrus Erie, Fotomaker, Fortega, Flyer, Tattoo, Peter Panic the News, the Secret, Fever, The Bryson Group, Sittin' Ducks. * Jim Bonfanti ‚Äì Raspberries, Pie, White Rain, Dynamite, Windfall, Obnoxious, Boxer. * Dann Klawon ‚Äì The Quick, Tattoo, Peter Panic, the Power Trio, the News, Sittin' Ducks. * Dave Burke ‚Äì The Power Trio. * Phil Giallombardo ‚Äì Pie, The James Gang. * Randy Klawon ‚Äì Cyrus Erie, the Quick, Moses, Peter Panic, the Window. * Bob McBride ‚Äì Cyrus Erie, the Quick. * Rick Caon ‚Äì The Castles, Sanctuary.

Records released a 5-song EP of unreleased songs by the band, called The Choir; it is still available on the label's website. In 1978, Bomp's first compilation LP, Best of Bomp Records, Volume 1 included one of these songs; this album was recently reissued on CD. In 1994, a Choir retrospective album, called Choir Practice, was issued by Sundazed Records as an LP and a CD, featuring all 5 of the songs on the Bomp EP, along with many previously unreleased tracks. Although Choir Practice omitted most of the tracks on the band's singles, the majority have been released on one or more compilation albums of garage rock and psychedelic rock music. For instance, \\"It's Cold Outside\\" was released on the landmark box set Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965-1968 (though not on the original double-LP release), along with the Pebbles, Volume 2 LP and CD.

Political and social views The bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh and the creation of Telangana state saw widespread agitation in the Seemandhra region and the demand for a united Andhra Pradesh. Raju elected from Kakinada in the Seemandhra region, has strongly opposed the division of Andhra Pradesh and had been critical of the way the government was going about the issue. Raju said the Cabinet had taken the decision to bifurcate the state in great haste without understanding the concerns of the region and considering the sentiments of the people. However, he continued to remain in the government and was criticised for not resigning. Raju has stood by his decision not to quit and is quoted to have said that though tendering one's resignation is considered a popular move with the election round the corner. He preferred to remain in the government and represent the views of his people at this crucial juncture. He preferred that the people of his constituency take into account the work and development in the constituency in the last two consecutive terms. He is said to be one of the few MP's to have completely used his MP LADS (Member of Parliament, Local Area Development Fund Scheme) for the development of his constituency. Education Pallm Raju has spoken emphatically and extensively for education as an enabler for progress. He waxes eloquently that children are the foundation of life. Nurturing a child with quality education and the right training empowers them for life. Enabling access to quality education and training will in turn enable them to stand on their own feet, have access to sustainable livelihood and opportunities for further growth. His vision to provide this access to his constituency has seen the establishment of a number of premier educational institutions in Kakinada, which is pitched to be an educational hub. He has also constantly emphasised the need for strengthening institutions like the Scouts, Guides and National Cadet Corps (NCC). The National Integration Camps of the NCC were held at Kakinada and Samalkot for 4 consecutive years. These camps were held with the objective of fostering the spirit of National Integration through various training and adventure activities. It also aimed at showcasing NCC to the general public of Kakinada, to project and popularise NCC among the youth. He strongly believes that other than the exposure and confidence building, moral rooting is another value that these institutions inculcate. No matter how developed; a young nation without proper moral rooting will turn out to be a liability. Pallam Raju Prothsaham Pallam Raju Protsaham is a foundation which is set up to encourage youth, nurture their talent and creativity and work towards helping them live their dreams and realise their full potential. The foundation organises programmes and projects that is a reflection of Pallam Raju's ideology for quality education. He is a strong advocate of practical application of knowledge and vocational training. Appathon The Appathons that the foundation has hosted in multiple colleges across Kakinada has been a huge success. The programme trains college students to develop apps for smart phones and on the final day a contest is held to design a unique app on their own with inputs and help from the trainers. The platform enables students to apply their theoretical knowledge practically and build on their creative skills. The event also gives them direction to take their skills to the next level and to a marketable platform.  Personal life  Pallam Raju is married to Mamatha Mallipudi and has a daughter Vahini Raje and a son named Jatin Sanjeevi Rao.

Written by vocalist Glenn Danzig, the song was later included on the compilation album Collection II, released in 1995, as well as on the album Static Age, which was recorded in 1978 but not released in its entirety until 1996. \\"Last Caress\\" is commonly considered to be one of the Misfits' greatest songs, and has been covered by a number of artists, including Metallica and NOFX. The Metallica version, a medley titled \\"Last Caress/Green Hell\\", has achieved notoriety in its own right. Background and release \\"Last Caress\\" first appeared as the final track on the Misfits' EP Beware, released in January 1980. The song was almost not included on the EP, as writer and vocalist Glenn Danzig was dissatisfied with the quality of the recording, but then-Misfits guitarist Bobby Steele convinced him to include it. The song was later included on the Misfits' album Static Age, which was recorded in 1978 but not issued in its entirety until the release of the boxed set The Misfits in 1996. The song was later included on the compilation album Collection II, released in 1995. A live version of \\"Last Caress\\" was also included on the 1998 album Evillive II. Since reforming the band without original vocalist Glenn Danzig, Jerry Only has changed the lyrics of the song to omit references to rape and infanticide, and eventually removed \\"Last Caress\\" from the Misfits' live set altogether. In a 2015 interview, Only cited seeing a television news piece about a couple raping, beating and starving their infant daughter to death as his reason for deleting Danzig's original \\"Last Caress\\" lyrics. Critical reception In 2012, Aaron Lariviere of Stereogum ranked the song #2 on his list of the 10 best Misfits songs, writing that while it has been \\"practically played out ... the song still stands as one of the best the Misfits would ever produce. Heck, it's one of the best songs ever produced by the punk genre.\\" In 2015, the song was also ranked #2 on an Ultimate Classic Rock list of the top 10 Misfits songs, with writer Eduardo Rivadavia calling it \\"simultaneously the Misfits' most offensive and singable ditty\\". The following year, Rivadavia included the song in an article published by Loudwire of \\"50 Disturbing Songs That People Love\\". Chris Kovatin of Kerrang! wrote that, with the song's opening lines, the Misfits \\"established themselves as everything creepier than everything else, and coined horror punk's unholy and everlasting legacy.\\" In a 2019 poll conducted by USA Today Network New Jersey regarding the greatest songs ever sung by an artist or band from New Jersey, \\"Last Caress\\" received the most votes with over 3,400 votes, beating \\"Born to Run\\" by Bruce Springsteen at over 660 votes, and \\"Blood and Roses\\" by the Smithereens at over 440 votes. In his book This Music Leaves Stains: The Complete Story of the Misfits, author James Greene, Jr. interprets the song's lyrics as outlining \\"the bold confessions of a remorseless killer and rapist\\", and writes that the lyrics \\"are delivered by Danzig with such romantic melody that the crimes almost seem like triumphs.\\" Personnel The Misfits * Glenn Danzig ‚Äì vocals * Jerry Only ‚Äì bass * Bobby Steele ‚Äì guitar * Joey Image ‚Äì drums Production * Dave Achelis ‚Äì engineer * Tom Bejgrowicz ‚Äì producer Cover versions \\"Last Caress\\" has been covered by such artists as, Local H, AFI, Dum Dum Girls, NOFX, and the all-female punk band the Ms. Fits.

The track, titled \\"Last Caress/Green Hell\\", was released on Metallica's 1987 EP The $5.98 E.P. - Garage Days Re-Revisited, as well as on their 1998 compilation album Garage Inc.. Beyond the Misfits arrangements, \\"Last Caress/Green Hell\\" also features the intro of the Iron Maiden song \\"Run to the Hills\\", deliberately played out of tune. \\"Last Caress/Green Hell\\" has become a staple of Metallica's live sets since they first covered it, with Setlist.fm having estimated that they have performed the track live at least 818 times. In 2015, \\"Last Caress/Green Hell\\" was ranked #23 on a Spin ranking of 151 Metallica songs, with staff member J.M.N. writing that \\"This medley of two of Glenn's early best retains the speed and attitude of the punk originals ‚Äî with an added Iron Maiden outro to boot, for extra ingratiating geekery.\\" In 2019, Matthew Wilkening of Ultimate Classic Rock named \\"Last Caress/Green Hell\\" as the best song from Garage Days Re-Revisited, calling it \\"an inspired medley\\".

He was a leading figure in the hospital chaplaincy and clinical pastoral education movements. History Born in Bloomington, Indiana, Boisen was the son of Hermann Balthsar Boisen and Elisabeth Louisa (Louise) Wylie. Both his father and his maternal grandfather, Theophilus Adam Wylie from whom his middle name stemmed, were professors at Indiana University. When his father died in 1884, his family moved into Theophilus Wylie‚Äôs home . Boisen graduated from Indiana University in 1897 and taught French and German, first in high school then later as a tutor at the university. During this period he suffered the first of several major psychotic episodes he would experience. Recovering from it, Boisen went on to study forestry and graduate from the Yale University School of Forestry in 1905. He went on to work for the U.S. Forest Service for several years before suffering a second psychotic episode. He entered the Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York and graduated in 1911. Boisen moved from the Presbyterian to the Congregational Church, and worked for the next ten years in rural church survey work, in pastorates in both Kansas and Maine. For two years during World War I, Boisen worked with the YMCA in Europe. In 1917, Boisen returned from Europe and experienced another breakdown, but recovered to accept an offer to join the Interchurch World Movement. As part of that work, he moved to North Dakota to conduct a rural survey. When the Interchurch World Movement collapsed in 1920, Boisen again fell victim to psychosis, and his family had him hospitalized at Westboro State Hospital, where it took him fifteen months to recover. While at Westboro, Boisen experienced a religious calling to work to bring religion and medicine closer together. After his release, Boisen began studies in the psychology of religion at Andover Theological Seminary where he remained from 1922 to 1924 working especially with the physician and ethicist Richard Cabot. In 1924 William Bryan of the Worcester State Hospital invited Boisen to become a hospital chaplain, and the following year he began a program at the hospital for the clinical training of theological students. Also during this period, Boisen began a five-year stint lecturing each fall quarter to students in the social ethics department of Chicago Theological Seminary. Boisen's ideas about mental illness began to mature during this period. He explored the concept that mental illness represents a crisis brought about by the failure to grow into higher social loyalties, including loyalty to God. In this way mental illness was purposive, he believed, and could be cured by the power of religion. In 1930 he joined with others in forming the Council for the Clinical Training of Theological Students, which would expose students for extended periods to people suffering illness and crisis, mainly in mental hospitals. In the same year, however, the death of his mother helped to precipitate still another brief period of mental illness. This breakdown caused Cabot to withdraw his support for Boisen as chaplain at Worcester State Hospital and Boisen influence in the Council to wane. In 1932 Boisen became chaplain at Elgin State Hospital near Chicago to be closer to Chicago Theological Seminary and to Alice Batchelder, a love interest who worked in Chicago. While there Boisen organized a Chicago Council for the Clinical Training of Theological Students, functioning effectively until he learned in 1935 Alice Batchelder was dying of cancer. The discovery resulted in his brief hospitalization in Baltimore, Maryland, but in December 1935 he returned to his chaplaincy post at Elgin where he remained as chaplain until 1954, then chaplain emeritus at Elgin until his death. Views Boisen believed that some mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, could be interpreted as one's attempts to solve \\"problems of the soul\\". Later, he explored the concept that mental illness represents a crisis brought about by the failure to grow into higher social loyalties, including loyalty to God. In this way mental illness was purposive, he believed, and could be cured by the power of religion. Published works In 1936 he published his ideas about religion and mental health in Exploration of the Inner World, which he dedicated to Batchelder. The book was praised by the New York Times Review of Books as being a \\"significant contribution to the religious literature field.\\" Boisen continued to expound his religious views in additional articles and books, notably Religion in Crisis and Custom (1955) and Out of the Depths (1960), his autobiography.

Former names include Milton-next-Sittingbourne, Milton Royal, Middleton, Midletun and Middletune. It has a population of about 5,000. Today it is a suburb of Sittingbourne although this has not always been the case, Milton Regis has the older and richer history. Until around 1800 Sittingbourne was a smaller hamlet and under the control of the Manor of Milton Regis. The ancient settlement was near the church, the current Milton Regis dates back only to 1052. There are many fine timber-framed houses and buildings remaining including a Medieval Court Hall (a seat of Justice and Administration) that dates back to 1450. The town and Manor of Middleton Regis as it was called then was recorded as the largest and most powerful manor in the Lathe of Scraye (in the centre of Kent). Milton Regis was formerly part of the Sittingbourne and Milton urban district. Geography The area occupied by Milton Regis is low lying, often marshy, land along the banks of Milton Creek. The creek is a drying arm of the River Swale which divides the Isle of Sheppey from the mainland. The Swale connects in the west with the lower reaches of the River Medway and provided the main transport route to the cities and towns of Rochester, Chatham and Maidstone. The Medway drains into the Thames estuary and allows inshore craft easy passage up to London and beyond. The eastern end of the Swale connects directly into the Thames estuary near Whitstable. Small coastal craft can navigate down the Thames into the North Sea and then by the short sea passage to Europe. Around a mile to the south of Milton runs the old Roman road of Watling Street linking London to Canterbury and Dover. One of the small hills in the area is occupied by Holy Trinity Church, the area below this between the hillock and the creek was the original site of the town. The area is prone to flooding, and after the sack of 1052 the town centre was moved atop the next hillock south where it remains to this day. The old site is the northern part of the Milton Creek Country Park. History The very early history of the site is speculative based on geography and the few remains found. An excavation at Castle Rough to the north of Milton Regis in 1972 uncovered around a hundred Mesolithic flint artifacts. They were present in disturbed material but indicate an unknown flint factory was in the vicinity.KAR032 Slightly further north, beyond the modern Kemsley village, there used to be a neolithic site from which worked stone implements have been retrieved. The site was destroyed by brick earth digging in the 1880s.KAR045 The 1972 dig at Castle Rough also revealed sherds of Romano-British pottery in the disturbed layers.KAR031 The Romans noted the quality of the barley and the oysters from Milton and established the town.Risbridger Local tradition records that princes Hengist and Horsa in their takeover of the kingdom of Kent from the local sub King Vortigern in circa 449 built a fortress or garrison near the remains of a Roman fort. In 680 the Queen Seaxburh of Kent the widow of King Eorcenberht of Kent, passed the Kingdom of Kent to her eldest son Ecgberht of Kent at his coming of age, crowning him King of Kent at a grand ceremony held at the doors of Holy Trinity Church, Milton. There she became a nun: St. Seaxburh ... took the holy veil at the minster which is called Milton in Kent. And the island in Sheppey belongs to Milton;.Lambeth Palace MS427 quoted in Dockray-Miller pp. 13-14: \\"sancta Seaxburh ... onfengon halig rifte on √∞am mynstre √æe is geeweden Middletune on kentlande. And √æ√¶t igland on Sc√¶pyge hyr√∞ into Middletune;\\" the reference to Sheppey establishes this as Milton Regis, not nearby Milton-next-Gravesend. Seaxburh subsequently founded Minster Abbey on the island before moving to Ely and becoming Abbess. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for 893 records: \\"Then ... Haesten came with eighty ships into the mouth of the Thames, and made himself a fort at Milton Royal\\".Quoted in KAR031 This naval force was only part of a larger fleet of 250 ships, the remaining group under the command of Jarl Harald (Bloodhair) landing at Appledore in the Romney Marsh in the south of Kent. It has long been supposed that this fort was at Castle Rough, but modern archaeological research has thrown doubt on the identity. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle also records Godwin, Earl of Wessex, a powerful nobleman at the time, burning the town to the ground in 1052, one of several Royal towns and property possessions belonging to King Edward the Confessor, that were destroyed by Earl Godwin's army, during a dispute which lasted over many years, due to Earl Godwin's challenge and claim to the throne of England. The town was later rebuilt to its former eminence. Domesday Book of 1086 records the town as Middleton Terra Regis (Royal lands) the Kings town of Kent. Noting it as a town and a port of wealth, whereby William the Conqueror, took it into his personal possession and gave it into the hands of his half brother Odo for safe keeping, and also appointed a portreeve, Hugh de Port, to preside over the town. Later he was to become the shirereeve or Sheriff of Kent. Edward Hasted notes that a document of 21 Edward I (1259‚Äì60) records the hundred as being the King's hundred. Queen Philippa was given the hundred by her husband King Edward II. A document of 1 anno Richard II (1367‚Äì68) exempts the men of the hundred from \\"all watch and ward\\" on the sea coasts; excepting Sheppey, most of which was within the hundred itself.Hasted (1798a) pp2-4 Local folklore has assigned the origins of Castle Rough to the Iron Age, Romans, Hengist and Horsa, Haestan and to a medieval fortified manor house. In order to investigate it further, the 1982 dig put in a trench on the southern side of the mound. Various layers of dumped material were identified, giving a confused stratigraphy. The topsoil yielded a silver penny of Henry VI issued in York between 1454 and 1460. The base layer contained green glazed pottery of the 13th‚Äì14th century. The extant earthworks are therefore no earlier than circa 1300. In 1798, the town was described as \\"... nor is it in any degree pleasant, the narrow streets, or rather lanes in it, being badly paved, and for the most part inhabited by seafaring persons, fishermen, and oyster-dredgers\\".Hasted (1798b) pp 163‚Äì192 Holy Trinity Church Holy Trinity Church The church has a long history. It is believed to occupy what was originally a pagan site of worship. There was a Roman villa nearby, and Roman bricks are still visible in the church walls.History of Holy Trinity The Cathedral records of Ely in 680 state that Seaxburh of Ely (Queen Sexburga, Abbess of Minster in Sheppey) left her 'life' at the doors of 'Mylton' Church. This should not be taken to mean she died, but that she left her secular life by taking the veil as a nun. The present church is of Augustinian foundation though with substantial additions and rebuilding in the Saxon and Norman periods. Other parts added were a family chapel and chancery by the local Barons (the Norwode (or Norwood) family) in about 1420. In the 13th Century, Stephen de Northwode built a manor in the Parish of Milton. The house was known as \\"Norwood without Sheppey\\" and also known as \\"Norwood Chasteners.\\" Rolfes The church also claims to have one of the thickest-walled Norman tower and to be one of the oldest churches in Kent. For such a large tower the ring of bells is surprisingly light. A ring of five bells was recorded in 1681, tenor , The tenor was recast as in 1890. In 1934 the whole ring was retuned, rehung, the tenor again recast and a new treble added. In 2019 two new trebles were added bringing the ring up to eight bells with a tenor of in G hung in the English style for full circle ringing.Love Local legend tells that after the village had moved to its current location, the church was going to be rebuilt in the centre. However each time stones were moved from the old site to the new place, St Augustine came down and put them back overnight. He had put the church where he wanted it to be and did not want it moving! Industry past and present In more recent times, the area in 1887 was heavily involved in the paper manufacturing industry, starting under the ownership of the Lloyd family (see Edward Lloyd (publisher) and Hvittingfoss ), wealthy newspaper publishers from London, however finally the local mill ceased production in January 2007.Medway Pilots During a similar period the area around Milton Regis and its marshlands was very involved with brick making, being rich in brick earth as a local resource. The yellow London stock brick required 64% brick earth, 25% ash, 11% chalk. Chalk was extracted from along the Medway, and the ash (or breeze as it was called) was a return cargo from London. Other components of the London rubbish, provided the fuel needed to slow fire the bricks. The water flow from the creek provided a power source for the paper mills at Milton Regis and Kemsley to operate and was an effective, safe and cheap method of transporting the materials in and the goods out. This long commercial and industrial history of Milton Creek generated a need for a large fleet of trading barges at the time, and sadly now that time has passed. A major industry remaining in the area is Milton Pipes, producers of pre-cast concrete drainage pipes.Milton Precast Since 2011‚Äì12, a Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) funded community oral history project has been taking place in Sittingbourne and Milton Regis recording the memories of people who remember the former industries along Milton Creek, mainly barge-building, brick and cement making, and the paper mills.Milton Creek Memories Places of interest The Court Hall and Milton Regis High Street *Holy Trinity church *The Sittingbourne and Kemsley Light Railway *The Periwinkle Water Mill.

History Midland Red West Plaxton bodied Leyland Leopard in March 1989 Y type bodied Leyland Leopard in Blackpool in August 2001 Citibus New Zealand Motor Bodies bodied Leyland Leopard in Dunedin, New Zealand in September 2007 The Leyland Leopard was introduced in 1959.New Middle-weight Passenger Chassis Commercial Motor 21 August 1959Over 125 vehicles at Kelvin Hall Commercial Motor 13 November 1959 It was developed from the Leyland Tiger Cub, one of the most important changes being the introduction of the larger and more powerful O.600 engine (later-built Leopards were fitted with the 11.1-litre O.680 engine).A Lively Beast Commercial Motor 25 December 1959 The Leopard was superseded by the Leyland Tiger. Designation The original 30 ft bus version was coded L1, it was right hand drive with a 16 ft 2in wheelbase and an overall length of 29 ft 4in. The 30 ft coach was the L2 which had the same wheelbase but was an inch shorter overall, the left-hand-drive LHL1 shared the wheelbase but the overall length was 29 ft 2in. All had a swept turning circle of 68 ft. The initial 36 ft models launched at the 1961 Scottish Motor Show at Kelvin Hall all shared an 18 ft 6in wheelbase, the PSU3.1R PSU3.1L PSU3.2R and PSU3.2L bus versions had a chassis length of 35 ft 1 1/2in with a swept turning circle of 71 ft and the coaches, PSU3.3R PSU3.3L PSU3.4R and PSU3.4L had a chassis length of 31 ft and a swept turning circle of 68 ft. standard Gross Vehicle Weight of the PSU3 was 11 1/4 tons but a 13-ton GVW was optional. As at May 1964 all Leopards had the O:600 engine and only the longer versions (.2 and .4) could be had with Pneumocyclic transmission. Later Variants In 1966 the LHL1, L1 and L2 models (and the Royal Tiger Cub) were replaced by the Leopard PSU4 series which had a similar chassis and axles to the PSU3, the coach versions having a shorter frame rather than the drop frame extension of the L2. They were preceded by C-class buses for C√≥ras Iompair √âireann which were to the same length as the PSU4 but coded PSU3.4R From 1968 Leyland introduced the A suffix across all existing passenger models, this denoted the rationalised Pnuemocyclic gearbox when fitted: this replaced various AEC and Leyland epicyclic transmissions and included a ten-speed splitter version offered in the Super Beaver articulated lorry this was built in a new extension to the Farington works. All PSU4A and PSU3A Leopards had the larger O.680 engine. New passenger models did not get the suffix so the 20 ft wheelbase version announced in 1968 was the PSU5.4R. The first was delivered to C√≥ras Iompair √âireann. Differences from the PSU3A and 4A included the option of a ten-speed splitter gearbox with wide ratio five speed standard, a Worldmaster front axle and a Maudslay rear axle. From December 1970, shorter Leopards were altered to conform with the PSU5, resulting in a change to the B-suffix, these changes also applied to the last Panthers. Scottish Bus Group continued to take the manual-gearbox Leopard with O.600 engine until that was discontinued in 1972/3, the O.680 powered Leopards with the Leyland part- synchromesh gearbox were still coded PSU3.3R Late in 1974 spring-operated parking brakes, automatic brake adjusters, a water-cooled air compressor and a revised engine mounting resulted in a change to PSU3C, PSU4C and PSU5A. Leyland ceased making a manual gearbox for the Leopard and a version with ZFS4:60 gearbox and otherwise up to date chassis specification was sold to Scottish Bus Group as the PSU3C.3R, there was by this time no generally available manual option. During 1976 springs and axles were uprated and the close-ratio version of the five speed Pneumocyclic became standard this applied to the PSU3D, PSU4D and PSU5B. A forthcoming change in crashworthiness regulations caused the air-brake chambers to be re-sited during 1977, leading to the PSU3E, 4E and 5C. In 1979 the twentieth year of Leopard production, the tyre equipment and coolant warning system were revised, the wide ratio Pneumocyclic with direct air operation again became standard and the ZF S6-80 six-speed synchromesh became a general sale option on coach chassis designated by .5 these were the PSU4F, PSU3F and PSU5D In 1982 with the TL11-powered Tiger already launched, the PSU4G, 3G and 5E had a rationalised O.680 which shared TL11 components. Operators In England, sizeable Leopard fleets were built up by various National Bus Company subsidiaries including Birmingham & Midland Omnibus Company.¬£2m Leyland Bus Orders Commercial Motor 9 February 1962 BET Group subsidiaries were major customers for Leopards. For buses and dual-purpose vehicles, a BET standard design of bodywork was produced, primarily by Marshall and Willowbrook but also to a lesser extent by Weymann and Metro-Cammell. Another major English customer for the Leyland Leopard was Barton Transport of Chilwell near Nottingham, which built up a fleet of 200 with Plaxton Elite and Supreme coach bodywork. Unusually for a large operator, Barton standardised on this type of vehicle for all types of work including local stage carriage services; for this reason, all were fitted with a wide two-piece door, known as an \\"express\\" or a \\"grant\\" door. The latter term refers to the New Bus Grant, whereby the British Government paid part of the cost of a new bus providing it met certain specifications and spent a prescribed proportion of its time on local service work. Many other operators took advantage of this and bought Leopards built to the grant specification. In Scotland, many were bought by subsidiaries of the Scottish Bus Group and were mostly bodied by Alexander with the Y type body, as both buses and coaches.SBG orders 344 new buses Commercial Motor 5 December 1975 The Irish company CI√â also bought a substantial fleet, mainly with bodywork built in its own workshops, as did its Northern Irish counterpart the UTA and its successor Ulsterbus, which bought the Alexander (Belfast) X type body. The Leopard was extremely common on Northern Irish roads for over 40 years, with the first one arriving in 1965 and the last one in 1984. During this period a total of 1,500 Leopards were built. During the 30 years of The Troubles in Northern Ireland, a total of 228 Leopards were stolen from their depots and maliciously destroyed in public streets. In 2006, all Leopards were withdrawn from public service, with some even clocking up an incredible 28 years of service. In the 1980s, Ulsterbus shortened a few of its Leopards for use as towbuses. Leyland Leopards also saw use with the British Military, and were exported to many other countries. Although the vast majority were used as buses or coaches, a few were bodied as pantechnicons, and at least one as a car transporter. The Leopard was popular with National Express operators.Successful launch of M4 express Commercial Motor 14 January 1972 Exports The Leopard was also popular with Australian operators.Welcome to the Australian Bus Fleet Lists Australian Bus Fleet Lists The Public Transport Commission purchased 745 for use in Sydney and Newcastle between 1967 and 1976 giving it the world's largest Leopard fleet.Withdrawn & Disposal Information Australian Bus Fleet Lists Long standing Leopards purchasers into the 1980s included North & Western Bus Lines, Punchbowl Bus Company and Ventura Bus Lines.North & Western Bus Lines Australian Bus Fleet ListsPunchbowl Bus Co Australian Bus Fleet ListsVentura Bus Lines Australian Bus Fleet Lists In the early 1990s, a number of Leopards were rebodied. This was to take advantage of a loophole that allowed rebodied buses in New South Wales to be classified as new buses for fleet average purposes, the loophole was later closed and the practice ceased. New Zealand operator Wellington Transport Authority ordered 94 Leopards.Kiwi order for Leyland Commercial Motor 26 August 1977 In 1980, Auckland tour operator Bonnici Coachlines purchased ten 12.5 metre three-axle Leopard coaches.Leyland Leopard PSU3 Buses and Coaches Omnibus Society of New Zealand In 1979, Leyland delivered a single Leyland Leopard diverted from an order by Jones Omnibus Services in Aberbeeg to Singapore Bus Service (SBS) in hopes for large-scale orders from SBS. Bodied by Walter Alexander Coachbuilders and registered as SBS6791L, it was an early example of the mid-engine bus in Singapore, preceding even the much larger orders of the Volvo B10M in the 1990s. Despite favourable reviews from SBS, no further units were purchased and SBS6791L was returned to the UK and sold to Woods of Mirfield, West Yorkshire. Competitors The Leyland Leopard's major direct competitor throughout most of its life was the AEC Reliance, even though AEC was a subsidiary of Leyland for a large proportion of that time. In the 1970s, the Volvo B58 became a serious competitor. There was also some competition for the Leopard from lighter weight chassis such as the Bedford VAL and Y-series.

History Having previously recorded on the Narada label and admitting it was a great experience music-wise, Joseph didn't like the lack of control over the end product, and asked to be released from his contract. He started Robbins Island Music in 1998, composing, producing, and distributing his own recordings. Hence, Solo Journey was released in 1999, composed of eleven soft piano compositions. While Joseph's first two releases, Hear the Masses and Rapture, employ mainly orchestral compositions and arrangements, this album features Joseph on soft solo piano and is characterized as being a \\"scaled down introspective, ... and while simplistic was still breath-taking\\", by Michael Debbage of Wind and Wire Magazine. Joseph's goal for this album was to provide an \\"intimate and peaceful environment for the special times we all encounter in our lives\\". Reviewing for Solo Piano Publications, Kathy Parsons calls it a \\"beautiful musical excursion\\", \\"...inviting the listener to kick back and relax for a while\\"; although, as a piano teacher, she opined that \\"most of the piano parts sound electronic\\", stating, \\"As good as the electronic pianos have gotten, they lack the warmth and richness of a great acoustic grand.\\" Parsons observes that \\"The Long, Last Mile\\" starts out with a bittersweet melody, and then builds in intensity and complexity with cello, winds, and ethereal sounds intertwining around the piano. Then it breaks off, and the opening melody returns. She describes \\"Winter Moon\\" as a simple, straightforward melody with a gentle rhythm; and \\"The Poetry Room\\" as almost minimalist in its simplicity, \\"also very beautiful\\". She goes on to say, \\"'The First Snow' gently describes the quiet but dazzling splendor of the first snow of the season. Joseph makes effective use of arpeggiated chords in the upper registers to depict the light dancing in sparkles. In 2003, Joseph released a sequel to this album, The Journey Continues.

See Henry Robert Addison, Charles Henry Oakes, William John Lawson and Douglas Brooke Wheelton Sladen (eds.) \\"Hopkinson-Hornby\\", 'Who's Who, Vol. 57, 1905, p. 795, A & C Black, accessed 12 July 2011 It was produced by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and opened at the Savoy Theatre on 7 January 1899 for a run of 143 performances. The opera starred the usual Savoy Theatre cast from that period, including Walter Passmore, Henry Lytton, Robert Evett, Ruth Vincent, Emmie Owen and Isabel Jay. Direction was by Richard Barker, choreography was by Willie Warde, and costumes were designed by Percy Anderson. Background The opera is based on L'√©toile, written in 1877 by Eug√®ne Leterrier and Albert Vanloo, with additional material by Paul Verlaine and music by Emmanuel Chabrier. It is also based on The Merry Monarch, an American translation of L'√©toile by J. Cheever Goodwin with music by Woolson Morse, produced in 1890. Caryll used a small amount of Chabrier's music in the first act finale.\\"Savoy Theatre\\", The Times, 9 January 1899, p. 11Coles, Clifton. \\"The Lucky Star: Introduction\\", The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 23 March 2002, accessed 6 January 2014 The Lucky Star was the only Savoy Opera where a woman plays a man's part. The piece has many other characteristics of Edwardian musical comedy, which had become popular on the London stage in the 1890s ‚Äì broader comedy, a thin romance, bright tunes, comedians, a chorus of pretty girls, some risqu√© situations, a \\"coon\\" song, songs regarding news of the day, separate authors of dialogue and lyrics, and a star, Walter Passmore. This half-musical, half- comic opera, did not appeal strongly to the Savoy Theatre's audiences and was unable to achieve a long run. Synopsis King Ouf is a superstitious monarch. The King is informed by his astrologer Siroco that his destiny is linked with that of an itinerant painter named Lazuli, who is in love with the King's intended bride, the Princess Laoula. Siroco's astrological charts reveal that Lazuli's death will result in the King's. The King decrees that Siroco will be executed moments after the King's death, and so both have an interest in keeping Lazuli alive.

S. Vivekananda Reddy (8 August 1950 ‚Äì 15 March 2019) was a member of the 14th Lok Sabha of India. He represented the Kadapa constituency of Andhra Pradesh. He was a member of the Indian National Congress. He was elected to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Parliament of India from the Kadapa constituency in Andhra Pradesh. He was brutally stabbed to death at his residence in Pulivendula, Kadapa District of Andhra Pradesh in March 2019. It took a political turn when YS Jaganmohan Reddy and YSR Congress Party blamed the Telugu Desam Party. TDP also countered YS Jagan for running conspiracy around murder, taking turns on demanding CBI enquiry and being least bothered probing his own uncle's murder case after forming his own Government in Andhra Pradesh after 2019 General Elections. Personal life Being born into a Christian middle class family on 8 August 1950 to Y. S. Raja Reddy and Y. S. Jayamma. Vivekananda Reddy was the younger brother of the former Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy. He is a graduate in Agriculture from S.V. Agricultural College in Tirupati. He has one daughter. Political career He was the designer of Lingala Canal in Kadapa district. He began his services to the community through the Lions club, became district Governor and the Samithi President. Vivekananda Reddy was twice elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly for the Pulivendula constituency, in 1989 and 1994. Then, in the elections of 1999, he was elected to the Lok Sabha from the Kadapa constituency with a majority of over 90,000, which was the highest majority gained in the state. In 2004 elections he increased that majority to over 110,000. In September 2009, Vivekananda Reddy was elected as a member of the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Council. On 30 November 2010 he became Agriculture Minister in the Andhra Pradesh cabinet headed by N. Kiran Kumar Reddy. Later, in the 2011, Vivekananda Reddy contested the Pulivendula by- elections caused due to Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and his mother, Y. S. Vijayamma, leaving the INC to form YSR Congress. He stood as the INC candidate against his sister-in-law and just managed to secure his deposit after finishing in second place but some 80,000 votes behind Y. S. Vijayamma. His sister in law party YSRCP has demanded a CBI probe for investigation.  Murder of Vivekananda Reddy  As per preliminary conclusions of the Post- mortem reports YS Vivekananda Reddy has been brutally murdered and found at his residence in Kadapa on 15 March 2019. The murder took place few weeks before the General Elections 2019 in The state of Andhra. As per Forensic Report, he was stabbed to death. The coroner's report says that there were seven stab wounds on his body made by a sharp object. Kadapa SP Rahul Dev sharma said, \\"We have formed a SIT headed by ASP Operations who will lead the team and investigate the murder. We have collected finger prints and other forensic evidence. The Victim has seven deep wounds on the head and right hand\\". On Thursday night he was alone at his residence in Pulivendula. Two days before the murder, he was seen at YS Jagan mohan Reddy residence at Hyderabad. YSR Congress expressed distrust of the SIT formed by the Telugu Desam Party Government and asked for the CBI to investigate the murder of YS Vivekananda Reddy. A prime suspect of the Vivekanada Reddy Murder case, Srinivasulu Reddy, killed himself and alleged he was harassed by the police with false allegations on him Sep 2019 by taking sleeping pills. Jagan rejected the probe by State Government of Andhra Pradesh and moved to the High court seeking a CBI inquiry in to his uncle's murder. But after he came to power in May 2019 He constituted a new SIT of the State Police to probe the murder and even tried withdraw his own petition demanding CBI probe. He argued that SIT doing a perfect Job. TDP continued criticism on YS Jagan mohan Reddy on different issues, including his cousin approaching the court High Court of Andhra Pradesh seeking CBI probe in to YS Vivekananda Reddy murder. TDP alleged that after Ys Jagan became chief minister made a about-turn on murder case.TDP said \\"After his emotional initial reaction Jagan now appears to be least bothered about bringing culprits in murder case to book\\". and also reminded his statements to CBI probe when he was in opposition and not taken a single step in that direction after forming Government. And also Questioned, \\"what stopping him to hand over the case to CBI ?\\". However, Viveka's wife Sowbhagyamma, daughter Sunitha, former TDP minister C Adinarayana Reddy and TDP lawmaker BTech Ravi had filed separate petitions in the Hight court of Andhra demanding the murder case must be entrusted to the CBI. Dr. N.Sunitha Reddy and her Husband N.Rajasekhar Reddy also gave a list of around 12 suspects including Kadapa MP Y. S. Avinash Reddy and his father YS Bhasker Reddy at the scene who were allgedly involved in her father murder case. These two questioned the wisdom of Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy for not handing over the case to CBI as he said earlier. She argued that SIT has delivered no justification and only a CBI case could unearth all the facts. She said that she believed Avinash Reddy protecing Shankar Reddy for personal reasons. the petitioning coupled claimed that D.Siva Sankar Reddy was YSRC Party state general secretary and was close to both Mr Bhaskar Reddy and Mr Avinash Reddy and also stated Siva Sankar Reddy was a person with known criminal activities in the past, adding that her father was expressed anger against him in the several occations and also instrumental in her father loss of MLC Elections in 2016. The High Court Expressed dissatisfaction over the lack of progress in the investigation by the state police as the murder completed a year stating \\"It was unfortunate the killers are yet to be traced even after 11 months after the commencement of the Investigation. The court asked the CBI to probe the murder which happened at extraordinary circumstances. Since the killers could be interstate gangs, the court felt CBI could tackle the case.\\" The Court also directed CBI to begin the probe from Pulivendula Police station and complete the probe at the earliest.

It is monotypic with a single species, Romalea microptera, known commonly as the eastern lubber grasshopper, Florida lubber, and Florida lubber grasshopper. It is the most distinctive grasshopper species within the south-eastern United States, and is well known both for its size and its unique coloration. It can reach nearly in size. It is the type genus and species of the relatively new family Romaleidae and tribe Romaleini, and was long known as Romalea microptera before being moved to Romalea guttata. However, after new research, the remaining names (including guttata) have been marked as nomina oblita and microptera takes priority once more. Life cycle Adult stage (bottom) and nymph stage (top). Romalea microptera goes through several stages, like all insects. When in the nymph stage, it is smaller than in the adult stage, wingless and completely black with one or more yellow, orange or red stripes. In the adult stage, they reach , grow wings half the length of their body and become either a dull yellow often characterized by black spots and markings, a bright orange with black markings, or entirely black (as in the nymph stage) with yellow or red striping. In the black adult color phase, the grasshopper is widely known by the name \\"diablo\\" or \\"black diablo\\". In Louisiana, they are known as the \\"Devil's horse\\" or \\"'\\". The insect is also colloquially known as a \\"graveyard grasshopper\\". In Mississippi they are known as \\"giant locust\\". Location Romalea microptera inhabits regions west of North Carolina to Tennessee, in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas and Texas, and throughout Florida, Missouri and Arizona. They live in open pinewoods, weedy vegetation and weedy fields. Sometimes these grasshoppers live in sewers, since grass and other food sources accumulate there. Size and wings Romalea microptera can reach nearly in size. Their wings are rarely ¬Ω the length of the abdomen; most of the time they are much smaller than that, and cannot be used for flight. Defense Eastern lubber grasshopper expanding its wings Romalea microptera has several defense strategies. The first is its brightly colored warning pattern (aposematism). Additionally, the insect emits a foul-smelling and foul-tasting foamy secretion from the thorax when it is disturbed. The secretion is dark colored and opaque. It also lets off a loud hissing sound that can scare animals.

The story is set in 1938 and concerns eight famous women from different historical periods who all are interned in the same insane asylum. Participants The women are -- or at least believe they are -- author Gertrude Stein, martyr Joan of Arc, activist Susan B. Anthony, politician Queen Isabella I of Spain, Constanze Mozart (wife of the famed composer), pilot Amelia Earhart, silent-film actress Pearl White, and explorer Osa Johnson. They have come together to represent the women of the asylum in planning for an attack they believe is soon to come from the men's ward. The doctor is an omnipresent figure in the asylum, checking in on the women. In the play's context, it is suggested that the woman who claims she is Amelia Earhart could be telling the truth instead of being insane, given the time frame and that Earhart went missing. There are beliefs that the play is meant to symbolize the sexist and unjust treatment of women throughout history.

He fought against the American rebels in the American Revolutionary War, especially with Butler's Rangers, based near upstate New York. After the war, together with other Loyalists, Caldwell was granted land in Upper Canada (now Ontario). He helped found the town of Amherstburg, near the mouth of the Detroit River. He also served as a lieutenant colonel in the War of 1812, and as the Superintendent of Indians in the Western Department. He was a merchant and farmer in Amherstburg. Early life and education William Caldwell is believed to be the son of William and Rebecka Caldwell of County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. As a young man, he immigrated to Pennsylvania in the British colonies of North America in 1773. Career His initiation into combat was in the Wyoming Valley, Pennsylvania when Pennsylvanians fought against Connecticut settlers. In 1774, he served in Dunmore's War. In 1775, he was appointed an officer in the British Indian Department. With the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, Caldwell served with Lord Dunmore's forces in the attack on Norfolk, Virginia (1776), and was injured. Recovered of his wounds, Caldwell went to Fort Niagara, where he was appointed captain in Butler's Rangers on 24 December 1777. In the ranger campaigns, Caldwell was \\"a very active Partisan\\", according to the commandant of Fort Niagara. Leading his troops into battle, he exhibited a ruthlessness that the Americans would never forget. On 3 July 1778, he was present at Battle of Wyoming in Pennsylvania. In September 1778 he led an attack on German Flatts in the Mohawk Valley of central New York, together with the Mohawk chief Joseph Brant's leading his Iroquois forces. They destroyed all of the buildings and grain in the area, and killed and captured much livestock, leaving the settlers' struggling through the winter. Based out of Detroit, Caldwell led a force of about 50 rangers in many battles and expeditions in Kentucky and the Ohio Country. In 1782, he led his rangers and Shawnee allies in victories over the Crawford expedition and, after failing at Bryan Station, at the Battle of Blue Licks. After the war, Caldwell settled in the Detroit region that became Upper Canada. Together with other Loyalists, he was granted land in what became Amherstburg on the Detroit River and became a merchant. His partner was another Loyalist, Matthew Elliott. During the Northwest Indian War, he led a company (80-150 men) of Canadian militia alongside Western Confederacy Natives against advancing American troops at Fallen Timbers, the final engagement of the war. With the outbreak of the War of 1812, Caldwell was given command of a group of between 40 and 50 volunteers from the Canadian militia, called Caldwell's Rangers (or the Western Rangers). He fought at the Battle of the Thames and the Battle of Longwoods, among many other actions. Marriage and family Before his marriage, while in Fort Niagara, Caldwell had a relationship with a Mohawk woman. They named their son, born about 1782, Billy Caldwell.\\"William Caldwell\\", United Empire Loyalists Association of Canada, accessed 11 August 2011 The boy was first raised with his mother's people. In 1783 Caldwell married Suzanne Baby, daughter of Jacques Baby dit Dup√©ron. Together they had eight children, five sons and three daughters. In 1789 his father brought the boy Billy Caldwell into his family and gave him an education. Billy Caldwell later lived in the United States after 1818, where he became a prominent representative of the Potowatomi people in Illinois and Iowa. He was sometimes known to them as Sauganash, their term for a British Canadian. Career In the War of 1812, Caldwell was commissioned a lieutenant colonel. He gained commissions for all his sons by Suzanne in the regular army; Billy Caldwell was given a captain's commission in the Indian Department. After the death of Matthew Elliot in April 1814, Caldwell was appointed Superintendent of Indians in the Western District, with his son Billy as his second-in-command. William Caldwell died on 20 February 1822 in Amherstburg, Upper Canada. In popular culture *William Caldwell was portrayed in Walter D.

Military Some mounted machine guns and artillery pieces are equipped with metal armor plates to protect the gunners from sniper fire and shrapnel from explosions. Salvaged metal plates can sometimes service as improvised gun shields; in the Vietnam War crews of armored fighting vehicles and patrol boats would attach metal plates to the machine guns. Gun shields fell out of widespread use after the Vietnam war, but they have seen a resurgence in popularity during the 1990s. Israeli military analysts began urging the use of gun shields, pointing to the grave risk to soldiers exposed to fire from automatic weapons. In particular, it was noted that many casualties were hit in areas not protected by body armor or a helmet, such as the neck or face. The U.S. began using gun shields during the 2000s-era wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The major drawback of gun shields is that they limit the visibility of the user to the front, though new designs such as the Transparent Armor Gun Shield (TAGS for short) will alleviate this without sacrificing user protection.

It is recognized for its unique mixture of Neo-classical and Georgian architecture. It is also recognized for its part in local history. On April 18, 2012, the AIA's Florida Chapter placed the building on its list of Florida Architecture: 100 Years. 100 Places as Cresthaven/Boston House. History In the early 1900s, William T. Jones, who later became the third Sheriff of St. Lucie County, worked as an engineer for Henry Flagler on the Florida East Coast Railway. Jones suffered an injury in a railroad accident and received a settlement for his injury. With his settlement he built Cresthaven which is known today as The Boston House. Historical records show the cost of building the house was $6,000 and it wasn't completed until 1909. Some of the materials used to build the house were brought to Fort Pierce from Georgia by the FEC Railroad as Jones was a personal friend of Henry Flagler. Jones lost the house during the Great Depression. The McCarty family, whose most famous member was Dan McCarty, the thirty-first governor of Florida, bought the house in 1949, but didn't live in it. They preferred to stay across Boston Avenue in the family home built in 1905. That house was later known as The Governor's House until its demolition. The Boston House (Cresthaven) was restored in 1984-85 and is now a law firm's office. There are many myths surrounding the house's history.

By birth she is a Mende princess of Bumpe in Sierra Leone. She is the co-founder of Sierra Leone Rising, a non-profit organization that raises funds to improve education, economic opportunities, and sustainable living for people in Sierra Leone. In 2009 she co-authored her memoir, titled A Princess Found: An American Family, an African Chiefdom, and the Daughter Who Connected Them All.  Personal life  Culberson was born Esther Elizabeth Kposowa in Morgantown, West Virginia, to an American mother and a Sierra Leonean father. She was put into foster care as an infant and was later adopted by Jim and Judy Culberson, a couple from West Virginia. Her adoptive father was a professor of neuroanatomy at West Virginia University. Her adoptive mother was a special education instructor at an elementary school. She grew up not knowing anything about her birth parents. Culberson was raised in the United Methodist faith. Culberson played basketball, served as student body president, and was the homecoming queen at University High School. She received a theatre scholarship to West Virginia University and graduated in 1998. She later obtained a masters of fine arts degree from the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco. In 2004 Culberson hired a private investigator to find her biological parents. She discovered that her biological mother, a white woman from the United States named Penny, had died from cancer twelve years earlier and that her father, Prince Joseph Konia Kposowa, was a member of a Mende royal family. Her paternal grandfather, Francis Kposowa, had been the Paramount Chief of Bumpe in Sierra Leone. As a Mahaloi, or granddaughter of the Paramount Chief, she is accorded the status of princess by the Mende people. She reconnected with her father after writing him a letter. Her father revealed that he had been a visiting college student when she was conceived, and he and her mother agreed they were too young and not financially suitable to care for a child at that time. Upon arriving in Bumpe, the chiefdom granted her the title Bumpenya, which is Mende for Lady of Bumpe. She is the niece of sociologist Prince Augustine Kposowa.  Career  In 2001 Culberson moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career. She has made appearances on the television shows In Case of Emergency, Strong Medicine, All of Us, Boston Legal, and The Secret Life of the American Teenager. She also had a role in the film American Dreamz. From 2005 to 2007 Culberson was a dancer with CONTRA-TIEMPO, a professional dance company based in Los Angeles that specializes in Salsa, hip-hop, and contemporary dance performances. She now serves on the dance company's board of directors and continues to perform as a guest artist. In 2006 Culberson co-founded Sierra Leone Rising, formerly known as Kposowa Foundation, a non-profit foundation that supports education, rebuilding of schools, and improving quality of life in the Bumpe Chiefdom of Sierra Leone after the civil war. She works as director of service learning at the Oakwood School in Los Angeles. As the service director, she organizes school service trips to Sierra Leone. She had previously worked at the Brentwood School, where she established a dance program. In 2009 she co-authored the memoir A Princess Found: An American Family, an African Chiefdom, and the Daughter Who Connected Them All.

He died in a suicide attack on Yoshio Kodama, a multi-millionaire right-wing leader and leading figure in the Lockheed bribery scandals. Background Mitsuyasu Maeno was born Shimoichiro Maeno in about 1947. He attended classes in acting at the University of California in 1967. Maeno was married twice, both marriages ending in divorce. His troubled personal life also included a suicide attempt. According to his father, Maeno came under the influence of the right-wing and ultra-nationalistic philosophies of the writer Yukio Mishima. In November 1970, Mishima had attempted to incite the Self-Defense Forces to overthrow the 1947 Constitution of Japan. When his efforts to restore Japan to a wartime samurai ethic failed, Mishima committed ritual suicide. In contrast to the vocal right-wing, numbering approximately 120,000 in 1976, the \\"secret\\" or \\"romantic\\" rightists which Maeno joined harbored a hatred of Japan's 1947 \\"Peace Constitution\\", and idolized the samurai beliefs of bushid≈ç. According to contemporary estimates, this group numbered between 10,000 and 30,000 in the mid-1970s. In 1971, Maeno attended a meeting of ultra-nationalists in Tokyo's Okura Hotel. Featured at the meeting was \\"Song of the Race\\", a composition by right-wing leader, Yoshio Kodama. The lyrics to the song, which the meeting promoted as the new national anthem, called for an overthrow of the government and a restoration of Japan's World War II Imperial policies. Kodama had been associated with gangsters and ultra-nationalism since the war years, and had served two years in prison as a Class A war criminal. One of the most powerful figures in post-war Japan, he was largely responsible for the yakuza's resurgence. Though Maeno had no real political connections, he came to admire Kodama as an ultra-nationalist leader. Acting career Maeno had difficulty in getting work in film, and began appearing in softcore pornographic films because of the better money. By 1976, more than two-thirds of Japan's films were in the pink film genre in which Maeno appeared. Nikkatsu, Japan's oldest studio, had been specializing in these softcore pink films since late 1971, and by the time of his death he had appeared in about twenty of the company's roman porno films. He had most recently appeared in his best-known role, Nikkatsu's Tokyo Emmanuelle (1976), for which he received screen billing. In this film he made love to the popular actress Kumi Taguchi while flying a plane. The film was the half-Caucasian Taguchi's debut for Nikkatsu, having appeared previously in films for Toei, including Tokyo Deep Throat (1975). Tokyo Emmanuelle later became the first of Nikkatsu's roman pornos to be distributed in Britain. Maeno was also an amateur pilot, and was registered at the Taiyo Flying Club. According to flight instructor Kiyoshi Yagi, Maeno had told him before the attack that he intended to crash his plane into Kodama's home. Lockheed Scandal In early 1976, Japan was scandalized by news of the Lockheed bribery scandals, and the involvement of the highest levels of Japanese political power, including Yoshio Kodama. Kodama had been confined to his house since suffering a stroke in 1975. He was accused of accepting more than seven million dollars from the Lockheed Corporation to bribe Japanese officials to facilitate sales of their airplanes. Maeno, disillusioned by a man he had previously respected, told friends that he believed Kodama had betrayed the right-wing and the samurai code which he espoused. The extreme brand of nationalism to which Kodama and Maeno adhered had generally remained hidden from public eye until Kodama's exposure in the Lockheed scandal. Calling Kodama a \\"shameful person\\", he considered the lobbyist's acceptance of money from Lockheed to be a national disgrace. Attack In early March 1976, Maeno flew around Kodama's neighborhood in Setagaya, gaining knowledge of the area in preparation for an attack. On the morning of March 23, 1976, Maeno arrived in the western suburbs of Tokyo at Chofu Airport with two friends. All three were dressed in the uniforms of kamikaze pilots, and Maeno informed airport officials that they were renting two planes for a kamikaze segment of a film. The flight was to prepare publicity for a planned film on the suicide bombers. Before 9:00 a.m., the actor posed in his uniform, with white scarf, rising-sun images on his sleeve, and a headband in front of the Piper Cherokee plane he had rented. With Maeno in one plane and his two companions in the other, they flew around Tokyo for a period of about one hour. Maeno then told his friends that he had business in Setagaya - Kodama's neighborhood. The other plane, with the cameraman on board, accompanied Maeno on the flight to Kodama's residence. Maeno flew low over Kodama's home, circling twice before diving into the building. An amateur radio operator reported that at 9:50 a.m. he heard Maeno call out \\"JA3551\\" - the number of his plane - and then saying emotionally, \\"Sorry I haven't replied for a long time. ,\\" after which the transmission suddenly ceased. Maeno hit the second floor veranda of the home and died in the crash. The crash caused a fire, which started on the second floor of the home, and two servants were injured. Kodama was resting in another part of the building when Maeno attacked. He was not injured and was carried from his home in a blanket. Kodama's yakuza bodyguards then went quickly to work to stop the fire. Angered, the guards attacked reporters who arrived on the scene. The reporters later complained that police had warned them not to \\"excite the young men\\". When news of the attack became known, a group of approximately twenty right- wing demonstrators arrived on the scene and clashed with the police in front of Kodama's home. At first fearing a conspiracy, police later confirmed that Maeno had acted on his own. Reaction Maeno's suicide flight inspired a variety of reactions in Japan. According to an Associated Press article, many Japanese felt some sympathy with Maeno's actions because of the shame associated with the Lockheed scandal. The scandal had shown an unsavory side of Japanese politics to the world, and there was a sense of frustration that the high-ranking politicians who had dealt with Kodama would never be revealed or brought to justice. Many, however, also equally rejected the ideological motives behind Maeno's attack. An editorial in the Mainichi Shimbun asked the question, \\"Is it imaginable that a young German, not a wartime officer, would commit suicide in a Nazi uniform, shouting 'Heil Hitler!'? Coming more than 30 years after the end of World War II, Maeno's kamikaze flight revived the ghost the Japanese wanted to forget.\\" Keiichi Ito, the director-general for training of the Japan Self-Defense Forces, said that Maeno's act was tainted by self- serving motives, not in self-sacrifice for the country. Ito, who was a surviving member of the tokk≈çtai, or kamikaze units, said \\"Maeno was performing an egotistical, grandstand play to win publicity, not unlike Mishima's suicide. Both were showing off to the world.\\" Nevertheless, Ito commended Maeno's technique in the attack. Commenting that, if Maeno's intent had been to kill Kodama, he could not have known where he would be located within the house. Ito said the bombing was, \\"very skillful, I give him the highest marks on that score.\\" Lockheed scandal historian David Boulton writes that the attack on one of the leading figures by a pornographic actor, \\"aptly summed up the obscenity of it all.\\" Aftermath Kodama was unharmed in the attack and went on trial in June 1977. The trial was postponed. Before it had been concluded, on January 17, 1984, Kodama suffered another stroke and died peacefully. Shortly before his death, the right-wing leader had expressed the view that he was being punished for taking money from Lockheed, a company that had built aircraft to fight Japan during World War II. In the years after his death, Maeno's Roman Porno appearances attracted a cult following among enthusiasts of the genre. Nearly three decades after his death, Maeno's career as an actor received a posthumous recognition through his best-known film appearance, in Chilean writer Antonio Sk√°rmeta's 2003 novel, The Dancer and the Thief. In the novel, lead character, √Ångel, meets his love interest in front of a Japanese cinema. The poster advertising Tokyo Emmanuelle and its cast, including Maeno's name, misspelled as \\"Mitsuyaso Mainu\\", becomes a point of connection between the two.

Throughout the world  Roofers on a pitched roof in the United States conducting a roof tear-off In Australia, this type of carpenter is called a roof carpenter and the term roofer refers to someone who installs the roof cladding (tiles, tin, etc.). In the United States and Canada, they're often referred to as roofing contractors or roofing professionals. The most common roofing material in the United States is asphalt shingles. In the past, 3-tab shingles were used; nowadays, \\"architectural\\" or \\"dimensional\\" shingles are becoming very popular. Depending on the region, other commonly applied roofing materials installed by roofers include concrete tiles, clay tiles, natural or synthetic slate, single-ply (primarily EPDM rubber, PVC, or TPO), rubber shingles (made from recycled tires), glass, metal panels or shingles, wood shakes or shingles, liquid-applied, hot asphalt/rubber, foam, thatch, and solar tiles. \\"Living roof\\" systems, or rooftop landscapes, have become increasingly common in recent years in both residential and commercial applications.See List of commercially available roofing material In the United States, regulation of the roofing trade is left up to individual states. Some states leave roofing regulation up to county-level and municipal-level jurisdictions. Unlicensed contracting of projects worth over a set threshold may result in stiff fines or even time in prison. In Oklahoma roofers are required to meet insurance and roofing license guidelines. Roofers are also required to show their license number on their marketing material. The United Kingdom has no legislation in place that requires a roofer to have a license to trade, although some do belong to recognized trade organizations.

His father Vincenzo (1871‚Äì1957) was evangelical preacher of the Italian Methodist Church. His mother was Paola Ciari (1870‚Äì1932). Biography When Francesco Fausto Nitti was seventeen, he fought in the First World War. In 1924, after the death of Giacomo Matteotti (a socialist deputy killed by will of Benito Mussolini), Nitti started an active anti-fascist propaganda, and as a result in December 1926 he was arrested and confined in Lipari. Along with two other political prisoners, Carlo Rosselli and Emilio Lussu, he managed to escape in July 1929 and to take refuge in France, where they founded Giustizia e Libert√†, a resistance movement opposing fascism. Nitti went to Spain in March 1937 and served the Republican faction as a major during the Civil War. After the defeat of his side, he came back to France where was relegated in a concentration camp and later sent on the Nazi Ghost Train in order to be deported in Germany; Nitti (as well as one hundred of the seven hundred prisoners) fled when the train was near the German frontier, after removing some planks from the floor of his wagon. He returned to France and joined the maquis, helping the French Resistance. After rejoining his family at Tolosa, in 1946 he eventually returned to Italy. Taking a variety of roles in anti- fascist associations, he was director of the Anpi- based review ‚ÄúIndependent Native land‚Äù and became a commune councilman in Rome.

Description and history The Zora Neale Hurston House stands in a residential area of Fort Pierce, on the north side of Avenue L, between North 17th and North 19th Streets. It is a modest single-story house, built out of concrete blocks stuccoed exterior and a flat tar-and-gravel roof. The house is not architecturally distinguished; it was one of a number of identical homes built in 1957 built by Dr. C.C. Benton, a medical doctor, who had sold 10 nearby acres for construction of \\"a new negro high school\\" nearby. Originally located on School Court, and it was moved, retaining orientation, north 500 feet in 1995 to 1734 Avenue L to allow for expansion of Lincoln Park Academy, the school at which Hurston taught.Zora Neale Hurston Dust Tracks Heritage Trail: Zora Neale Hurston House . Hurston, a native of Florida, was one of the leading female African-American writers of the mid-20th century. She lived rent-free (courtesy of Dr. Benton) in this house from 1957 until her death. While here, she worked as a journalist for the Fort Pierce Chronicle, taught at the academy, and continued to work on her manuscript for Herod the Great, a major work that remained unpublished at her death. This house is the only known home of hers to survive. The house is a stop on the Zora Neale Hurston Dust Tracks Heritage Trail.

It was founded in 1990 by Elenore Pred, Susan Claymon, and Linda Reyes. Based in San Francisco, BCAction is known for understanding breast cancer not as an individual crisis, but a public health emergency, and for their commitment to social justice. The organization's mission is to achieve health justice for all women at risk of and living with breast cancer. BCAction is known for its Think Before You Pink campaign, launched in 2002, which encourages consumers to ask critical questions before buying pink ribbon products and holds corporations accountable for pinkwashing. History In 1990, a group of women living with breast cancer in the San Francisco Bay Area were seeking information about the causes and treatment of their disease. They encountered unresponsive government agencies and private organizations that provided inadequate, superficial information‚Äînot the evidence-based data they were looking for. They got angry and turned that anger into action by forming Breast Cancer Action. The first meeting was held in founder Elenore Pred's living room. ‚ÄúWe are meeting to organize Breast Cancer Action,‚Äù the flyer for the meeting announced. ‚ÄúOur goals are education and political action to prevent a further rise in breast cancer.‚Äù One of the group's first acts was a meeting with the director of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to demand that the agency address the breast cancer epidemic. Founding members Elenore Pred, Susan Claymon, Belle Shayer, and Linda Reyes attended this meeting along with other breast cancer activists. Later, following the death of Elenore Pred, Susan Claymon became the first breast cancer activist to address the President's Cancer Panel in Washington, D.C. The actions of these founding women framed breast cancer not as an individual problem but as a public health crisis requiring systemic solutions, with an emphasis on empowering women living with and at risk of the disease. In 1995 Barbara Brenner became the organization's first executive director, a position she held until 2010 when she retired due to non-breast cancer-related health issues.Denise Grady, \\"Barbara Brenner, Breast Cancer Iconoclast, Dies at 61\\" (obituary), The New York Times, May 20, 2013. She was significant in increasing the organization's membership from 3,500 to more than 15,000, and increasing its emphasis on environmental issues and social critiques of the use of breast cancer activism. Since its founding, BCAction has continued as an advocacy group dedicated to breast cancer activism at local, state and federal levels. The organization sees breast cancer not as an individual issue but a \\"national public health emergency.\\" Their work has included an emphasis on more effective and less toxic breast cancer treatments that keep the needs of the public interest first; decreasing involuntary environmental exposures that put people at increased risk for breast cancer; and creating awareness that not only genes but also social injustices like political, economic, and racial inequities can lead to unequal outcomes of the disease. Activities BCAction educates, organizes, and takes action for systemic change in three priority issue areas: * Breast Cancer Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment: BCAction believes all women deserve access to evidence-based, patient-centered information so they can fully engage in their healthcare decisions. The organization thinks that \\"breast cancer research, treatment, and screening must be patient-centered and responsive to the needs of women at risk of and living with breast cancer, and should not reflect corporate or industry bias that puts profits over patients. Their work on diagnosis and treatment examines the data from a patient perspective and includes analyses of breast cancer screening; healthcare access; drug and device approval; and more effective, less costly, and less toxic treatments. * Root Causes of Breast Cancer: Over half of the women diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States have no known risk factors. With family history accounting for only around 10 percent of breast cancer diagnoses, a large and growing body of research indicates that toxic chemicals may increase our risk of developing the disease. In 2012, the President‚Äôs Cancer Panel reported that ‚Äúthe true burden of environmentally induced cancer has been grossly underestimated [and] . . . the American people‚Äîeven before they are born‚Äîare bombarded continually with myriad combinations of these dangerous exposures.‚Äù BCAction states that individual solutions like ‚Äúshopping wisely‚Äù and ‚Äúchoosing healthy‚Äù are insufficient to stem the driving environmental causes of the breast cancer epidemic. The organization believes only large-scale systemic change can address the root causes of breast cancer and they work to address these root causes by eliminating the involuntary exposures to hazardous and toxic chemicals present in our daily lives that put people at increased risk of breast cancer. Their work is guided by the precautionary approach to public health and true primary prevention of breast cancer. * Pink Ribbon Marketing and Culture: Breast cancer has ballooned into a multibillion-dollar industry, even as it remains a public health crisis, and the pink ribbon is now one of the most widely recognized symbols and marketing tools. The pink ribbon provides many people with a sense of community and has turned breast cancer into a topic of shared conversation rather that a shameful secret. Yet the significant lack of accountability, the absence of transparency, and the widespread hypocrisy in the pink ribbon marketing culture exploits a disease that devastates communities, misrepresents who is affected by breast cancer, and excludes and marginalizes women's diverse lived experiences of the disease. BCAction's work to end the breast cancer epidemic cuts through the pink noise to tell the hard truths about this disease and challenge ‚Äúpinkwashing‚Äù hypocrisy and pink ribbon culture, which have become the status quo of the breast cancer industry. They address the impact that breast cancer has on women's lives and communities, and work to bring about the systemic changes that will end this epidemic. Achievements Some achievements include: * A two-year awareness campaign raised funding that helped enact the California Safe Cosmetics Act of 2005, signed by California state governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The group considers this is a considerable achievement for the environmental breast cancer movement because toxic chemicals in cosmetics can potentially be an environmental cause of breast cancer. * In 2009, awareness efforts including Yoplait's \\"Put a Lid on it\\" campaign which influenced General Mills and Dannon to remove recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH) from their dairy products. rBST has not been allowed on the market in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Israel and all European Union countries (currently numbering 27), by 2000 or earlier. In the United States, public opinion has caused a number of products and retailers to become rBST- free. * In 2011, Breast Cancer Action joined with Pesticide Action Network in leading awareness efforts that resulted in the pesticide methyl iodide being removed from the California market. The use of methyl iodide as a fumigant has drawn concern. For example, 54 chemists and physicians contacted the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in a letter, saying \\"We are skeptical of U.S. EPA‚Äôs conclusion that the high levels of exposure to methyl iodide that are likely to result from broadcast applications are 'acceptable' risks. U.S. EPA has made many assumptions about toxicology and exposure in the risk assessment that have not been examined by independent scientific peer reviewers for adequacy or accuracy. Additionally, none of U.S. EPA's calculations account for the extra vulnerability of the unborn fetus and children to toxic insults.\\" A lawsuit was filed in 2011 challenging California's approval of methyl iodide. Subsequently, the manufacturer withdrew the fumigant and requested that California Department of Pesticide Regulation cancel its California registration, citing its lack of market viability.Maker of methyl iodide scraps controversial pesticide - San Jose Mercury News References Further reading *Cancer, Inc.

There are no hard-set boundaries to the midtown area, but it is generally agreed to include the area in the vicinity of Lake Street between Interstate 35W and Hiawatha Avenue. Lake Street is the border between the Phillips and Powderhorn communities of Minneapolis. Lake Street/Midtown LRT Station, with service on the METRO Blue Line, is located on the eastern edge of the area. The midtown area was historically known as being somewhat of a run-down area. However, in the past decade or two, there has been a large revitalization effort along Lake Street, driven largely by an insurgence of new Latino and Northeast African businesses. Near the intersection of Chicago Avenue and Lake Street is the Midtown Exchange building, which was a Sears department store and mail-order catalog facility until the company closed it in 1994. After sitting vacant for a decade, the building was fully redeveloped. It features office space, residential units, and the Midtown Global Market, a large marketplace featuring an ethnically diverse variety of restaurants, grocers, and retailers. Other indoor markets that have opened in the midtown area include the Mercado Central (at Bloomington Ave and Lake St), which houses numerous Latino businesses, and the Lake Plaza (at 3rd Ave and Lake St), which houses Somali and Latino businesses. As of January 2009, a new market has opened in the former True Value Hardware site at the Hi-Lake Shopping Center (21st Ave and Lake St), housing Somali businesses. At 22nd Ave and Lake Street (in the parking lot of Anishinabe Academy School) the Midtown Farmers' Market operates on Tuesdays and Saturdays from late spring to early autumn.

They are currently members of the . Club information The club play their home matches at Thorp Arch, the Leeds United F.C. training facility near Wetherby. Leeds United Women have three senior teams: the first team competing in the WPL North Division 1 and U23s team in the women‚Äôs national reserve league, The U21S and U19s will play in the WRCWFL The club's most notable player was Sue Smith, who has played for over 10 years at international level for England, including at the 2007 Women's World Cup. The team was originally the Leeds United Ladies team. The team announced they were changing their name to Leeds Carnegie Ladies F.C. in July 2008. This came to ensure all of the professional sports teams Leeds Met University were investing in carried the name of the university's sport department, Carnegie College (including Leeds Carnegie and Yorkshire Carnegie) On 8 July 2010, it was announced by Leeds United F.C. that to stop Leeds Carnegie Ladies from going out of existence, the club would step in to provide funding again, bringing the club full circle back to Leeds United Ladies once more, a day under two years since the club was renamed Leeds Carnegie L.F.C. In 2014, after a change of ownership of Leeds United, the club was renamed Leeds Ladies Football Club. The club was renamed back to Leeds United Ladies 3 years later after another change of ownership of Leeds United At the start of the 2019‚Äì20 season the team name changed to Leeds United Women, following a trend of modernised naming in other teams . File:Leeds Carnegie LFC.png|Badge during the period as Leeds Carnegie L.F.C. File:Leeds Ladies FC logo.jpg|Club badge when known as Leeds Ladies History The club began in 1989. After playing in the Yorkshire and Humberside League for seven years, the 1997‚Äì98 season saw the team gain promotion to the AXA FA Northern Premier League under the management of Mark Hodgson. In 1999‚Äì2000 season they reached the semi-finals of the FA Women's Cup Narrowly losing 2‚Äì1 to Croydon in a very close game at Ossett Albion. After consolidating and adjusting to National League football for a couple of seasons, the team achieved promotion with a 5‚Äì0 win away at Wolverhampton Wanderers on 7 May 2001 and were crowned champions of the Northern Premier League and gained promotion to the Women's Premier League. Leeds finished a credible fourth in their first season in the top flight (2001‚Äì02), with manager Mark Hodgson winning The FA Women's Premier Leagues 'Manager of the Year' award. The following season proved to be a tough one and Leeds finished the league in seventh place. The 2003‚Äì04 season saw a new manager, Julie Chipchase, appointed and Leeds once again finished in fourth place ‚Äì the highest-placed team outside London. In the 2004‚Äì05 season the side finished in fifth place. Split from Leeds United The chairman of Leeds United A.F.C., Ken Bates, cut the ladies' club's funding by stopping financial backing in 2005, and withdrawing the Thorp Arch training facilities in 2006. The ladies' team managed to survive using sponsorship money. They were first sponsored in a two-year deal worth over ¬£70,000 by EmpireDirect.co.uk, before receiving sponsorship from Leeds Metropolitan University in a deal reported to be worth in excess of ¬£250,000 over 5 years, starting in 2007. The 2005‚Äì06 season saw the team accomplish one of its greatest achievements to date, playing in the FA Women's Cup final against overwhelming favourites Arsenal Ladies. Leeds United legend Allan Clarke presented them with sock tags before the match, similar to those worn by the Leeds United male team in their 1972 FA Cup Final victory, in a bid to give the team luck. Nevertheless, the match did not turn out how the team had hoped, with Arsenal winning the game 5‚Äì0. Leeds's Rachel Stowell (right) in 2006 against Birmingham The 2006‚Äì07 season was a fluctuating one, with Leeds topping the table over the Christmas period and the team getting through to the FA Women's Premier League Cup final for a second time. The opposition was again Arsenal and Leeds put in a much better performance than in their previous cup final appearance, but they lost out to a last-minute strike by Arsenal's Jayne Ludlow. This seemed to have a big impact, as the team didn't perform as well in the closing stages of the season and they had dropped down to fifth by the end of the season. The club won the Marketing Club of the Year award at the FA Women's Awards in May 2007 for the third consecutive year. A change in management was made in the close season and Rick Passmoor and Leanne Hall were appointed manager and assistant manager respectively in July 2007. The new management team made a number of new signings, including Steph Houghton, Carly Telford, Katie Holtham, Georgie Adams, Jade Moore and Carla Ward. By March 2008 the team were lying mid-table in the Premier League but finished in third position with 40 points, below Everton on 57 points and Arsenal on 62 points. The 2007‚Äì2008 season saw the club reach their second FA Women's Cup final, their third cup final in as many years. Arsenal again were their opponents and the match mirrored the previous League Cup final. The game was 0‚Äì0 at halftime, although Arsenal produced most of the chances in the first half and constantly forced United goalkeeper Carly Telford into some amazing saves. Action at the opposite end of the pitch was non-existent, as United striker Amanda Barr struggled. In the second half Arsenal scored three goals in seven minutes: Smith 53, Ludlow 59 and Sanderson 60. Leeds fought back with a header from Jess Clarke on 69, but Arsenal sealed their season double with a final goal from Kelly Smith seven minutes from time. Carly Telford was named Player of the Match before a record crowd of 24,582 at the City Ground. In the 2008 close season the club's name became Leeds Carnegie Ladies. England U23 striker Carla Cantrell signed from Doncaster Rovers Belles and England U19's Ellen White, also a striker, joined from Chelsea. After a poor start and with key players injured for extended periods, Leeds finished sixth in the Premier League in season 2008‚Äì09. In January 2010 the club's future was cast into doubt when their bid to join the FA Women's Super League collapsed. The following month they won the club's first major trophy, the Premier League Cup, with a 3‚Äì1 win over Everton at Spotland Stadium on 11 February 2010. In March 2013 the club were confirmed as one of 33 clubs to apply for up to 18 places available in the expanded two tier 2014 FA WSL with the outcome expected in June 2014. The club has started a \\"Show Some Love for Leeds United Ladies\\" campaign stating that the future of the club could depend on the success of their WSL application. Leeds United withdrew funding and permission to use their name and branding at the end of the 2013‚Äì14 season, causing Leeds United Ladies to cease to exist. In the immediate aftermath, a group of supporters rallied to create a new club, Leeds Ladies FC, to carry on the tradition of Ladies football in Leeds. New era ‚Äì April 2017 Following a varied season on and off the field; a break away from the vision which was laid out at the beginning and broken promises, it was decided that an EGM would be called to decide upon the future of the existing structure. It was decided that there was no longer any confidence in the previous leadership and a new committee would now take control of Leeds Ladies FC. After the EGM, the previous committee laid claim to the legal ownership of the club cancelling all training facilities and withheld club assets including playing kits and attempted to immediately dissolve the club. In order to ensure that the club kept going the new committee purchased a new kit, reinstated and paid for all training facilities and fulfilled all fixtures for both senior and both youth teams. The FA requested that the previous committee prove legal ownership which they have been unable to do. The club announced the appointment of a new structure behind the club, appointing Lee Townend as chairman of Leeds Ladies Football Club, with the full advisory support from the main sponsor Andrew Pinder. Lee previously worked with the club as director of football and head of youth development so he brings an extensive knowledge of the club to the new structure. Lee will be joined in the day to day matters by Kirsty Emmot who has been appointed as club treasurer and Jo Czibor as club secretary. Lewis Atkinson will become director of football and will maintain his position as first team manager supported by his coaching team. The remaining roles have been filled by the leadership team ensuring the club structure is in safe hands with a 6-person-strong executive committee. The club's main priority is to instil transparency across all areas. From financial to the club's ambitions, Leeds Ladies FC wants to be very open and honest in its approach and in its leadership. The current leadership team have a very positive attitude towards the future of Leeds Ladies FC and is looking forward to helping the club realise its potential. Leeds Ladies returns to Leeds United Ladies On 26 June 2017, new Leeds owner Andrea Radrizzani brought back Leeds Ladies to Leeds United ownership to become Leeds United Ladies again after the club had previously become its own entity after previous owner Massimo Cellino decided to stop Leeds United funding in 2014.

Methodology The use of qualitative methods, particularly ethnography, distinguishes media anthropology from other disciplinary approaches to mass media.Faye Ginsburg, Lila Abu-Lughod & Brian Larkin. (2002) Media Worlds: Anthropology of New Terrain. Within media studies, media ethnographies have been of increasing interest since the 1980s.David Morley. (1980) The ‚ÄúNationwide‚Äù Audience: Structure and DecodingIen Ang. (1991) Desperately Seeking the Audience However, as Stephen Putnam Hughes remarks in a recent review, these studies often do not engage in rigorous ethnographic fieldwork, ignoring or misapplying such landmark anthropological techniques as participant observation or long-term fieldwork.Stephen Putnam Hughes. (2011). 'Anthropology and the Problem of Audience Reception', in Marcus Banks & Jay Ruby. Made to be Seen: Perspectives on the History of Visual Anthropology Given such differences, anthropologists who take an interest in the media see themselves as forming a distinct subfield from ethnographic approaches to media studies and cultural studies. Theory The anthropology of media is a fairly inter-disciplinary area, with a wide range of other influences. The theories used in the anthropology of media range from practice approaches, associated with theorists such as Pierre Bourdieu, as well as discussions of the appropriation and adaptation of new technologies and practices. Theoretical approaches have also been adopted from visual anthropology and from film theory, as well as from studies of ritual and performance studies (e.g. dance and theatre), studies of consumption, audience reception in media studies, new media and network theories, theories of globalisation, theories of international civil society, and discussions on participatory communications and governance in development studies. Ethnographic contexts The types of ethnographic contexts explored in the anthropology of media range from contexts of media production (e.g., ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers, journalists in the field, film production) to contexts of media reception, following audiences in their everyday responses to media such as newspaper cartoons (Khanduri 2014). Other types include cyber anthropology, a relatively new area of internet research, as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media, such as development work, social movements, human rights Wortham, Erica (2013) Indigenous Media in Mexico: Culture, Community and the State (Duke University Press)or health education. This is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts, where media such as radio, the press, new media and television (Mankekar 1999, Abu-Lughod 2005) have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s.Deborah Spitulnik.

It was developed and published by Creative Publications and was initially adopted by the U.S. state of California and schools run by the US Department of Defense by the mid 1990s. Unlike curricula such as Investigations in Numbers, Data, and Space, by 2007 Mathland was no longer offered by the publisher, and has since been dropped by many early adopters. Its demise may have been, at least in part, a result of intense scrutiny by critics (see below). Adoption Mathland was among the math curricula rated as \\"promising\\" by an Education Department panel, although subsequently 200 mathematicians and scientists, including four Nobel Prize recipients and two winners of the Fields Medal, published a letter in the Washington Post deploring the findings of that panel. MathLand was adopted in many California school districts as its material most closely fit the legal mandate of the 1992 California Framework. That framework has since been discredited and abandoned as misguided and replaced by a newer standard based on traditional mathematics. It bears noting that the process by which the framework was replaced itself came under serious scrutiny. Concept Mathland focuses on \\"attention to conceptual understanding, communication, reasoning and problem solving.\\" Children meet in small groups and invent their own ways to add, subtract, multiply and divide, which spares young learners from \\"teacher-imposed rules.\\" In the spirit of not chaining instruction to fixed content, MathLand does away with textbooks.Mathland articles A textbook as well as other practice books were available to reinforce concepts taught in the lesson. Standard Arithmetic MathLand does not teach standard arithmetic algorithms, including carrying and borrowing. Such methods familiar to adults are absent from the curriculum, and so would need to be supplemented if desired. The standard method for multi-digit multiplication is not presented until 6th grade, and then only as an example of how it is error- prone. Instead a Russian peasants' algorithm for calculating 13 x 18 = 234 is favored. By cutting and pasting various strips of paper, it can be solved by simply using 3 divisions, 3 multiplications, a cancellation, and an addition of three numbers. Sixth graders are asked to solve following problem: \\"I just checked out a library book that is 1,344 pages long! The book is due in 3 weeks. How many pages will I need to read a day to finish the book in time?\\" Long division is not used to divide 1,344 by 21. Instead, the curriculum guide explains that \\"division in MathLand is not a separate operation to master, but rather a combination of successive approximations, multiplication, adding up and subtracting back, all held together with the students' own number sense.\\"  Criticisms  Debra J. Saunders of the San Francisco Chronicle calls Mathland a math curriculum that prefers not to give lessons with \\"predetermined numerical results.\\" Kings County fourth-grade teacher Doug Swords says that 14 out of 18 teachers use MathLand only as a supplement. When asked if MathLand was helpful in teaching kids to multiply, he responded \\"No, quite frankly\\". Debra J. Saunders Where's the Math? DEBRA J. SAUNDERS San Francisco Chronicle Sunday, October 17, 1999 In a letter published in Stars and Stripes concerning the education of children by the Department of Defense, Denise McArthur wrote that \\"according to Dr. Wu, mathematics professor at U.C. Berkeley, the Interactive Math series is quite the worst math text I have ever come across\\". Another mathematician wrote, in the Notices of the AMS, \\"I respectfully urge the AMS leadership to withdraw its endorsement of the NCTM Standards. The Standards have paved the way for elementary pedagogies such as MathLand, which fail to develop the standard multiplication algorithm for elementary students\\". And another, \\"...the proposed MathLand materials, address neither our children's lack of basic skills nor their poor performance on tests ... it wholeheartedly embraces the philosophy of the \\"reform\\" movement ... a movement that is being seriously questioned by the mathematical and educational community ... it would be foolish to adopt something with such obvious inadequacies.\\" The Stars and Stripes August 7, 1997 Parents' cry can subtract MathLand Mathland had fallen out of favor by the mid-2000s and was no longer offered by Creative Publications as of 2007.

History The earliest frozen chocolate recipes were published in Naples, Italy in 1693 in Antonio Latini's The Modern Steward. Chocolate was one of the first ice cream flavors, created before vanilla, as common drinks such as hot chocolate, coffee, and tea were the first food items to be turned into frozen desserts. Hot chocolate had become a popular drink in seventeenth- century Europe, alongside coffee and tea, and all three beverages were used to make frozen and unfrozen desserts. Latini produced two recipes for ices based on the drink, both of which contained only chocolate and sugar. In 1775, Italian doctor Filippo Baldini wrote a treatise entitled De sorbetti, in which he recommended chocolate ice cream as a remedy for various medical conditions, including gout and scurvy. Chocolate ice cream became popular in the United States in the late nineteenth century. The first advertisement of ice cream in America started in New York on May 12, 1777 when Philip Lenzi announced that ice cream was officially available \\"almost every day\\". Until 1800, ice cream was a rare and exotic dessert enjoyed mostly by the elite. Around 1800 insulated ice houses were invented and manufacturing ice cream soon became an industry in America. Production Chocolate ice cream is generally made by blending cocoa powder along with the eggs, cream, vanilla and sugar used to make vanilla ice cream. Sometimes chocolate liquor is used in addition to cocoa powder, or it is used exclusively, to create the chocolate flavor. Cocoa powder gives chocolate ice cream its brown color, and it is uncommon to add other colorings. The Codex Alimentarius, which provides an international set of standards for food, states that the flavor in chocolate ice cream must come from nonfat cocoa solids that must comprise at least 2.0-2.5% of the mix weight. The US Code of Federal Regulations \\"permits reductions in the content of milk fat and total milk solids by a factor of 2.5 times the weight of the cocoa solids\\", in order to take into account the use of additional sweeteners. The minimum fat content of chocolate ice cream in both Canada and the United States is 8%, irrespective of the amount of chocolate sweetener in the recipe. Availability Scoops of chocolate malt ice cream Chocolate ice cream is sold in multiple locations, including restaurants, caf√©s, diners, supermarkets, grocery and convenience stores, and Pleb Houses. Ice cream parlors specialize in the sale of ice cream. Chocolate is one of the five most popular ice cream flavors in the United States and second only to vanilla. Other flavors Chocolate ice cream is used in the creation of other flavors, such as rocky road. Other flavors of ice cream contain chocolate chips mixed in with the ice cream. For example, (plain) chocolate chip ice cream is made with vanilla ice cream, chocolate chocolate chip (or double chocolate chip) ice cream is made with chocolate ice cream, and mint chocolate chip ice cream is made with mint ice cream.

Hamlin and Hattie Bennion; also the great-granddaughter of former U.S. Vice President Hannibal Hamlin. She is a shadowy figure today, and would probably be completely forgotten were it not for a series of 78rpm spoken word recordings she made for children in the 1910s and 1920s. Sally recorded primarily for the Victor Talking Machine Company, but also recorded a few 7\\" discs for Emerson Records. These records were readings of poetry by such authors as Eugene Field and James Whitcomb Riley, classic stories such as Cinderella and Rumpelstilskin, and even excerpts from Pollyanna by Eleanor H. Porter. Sally also recorded piano rolls for Duo-Art and a piano solo \\"The Butterfly\\", for Victor, which was never issued. Sally Hamlin was fifteen years old when she signed a one year contract with Victor on April 12, 1917 and made the trip from her home at 7 Woodruff Avenue, in Brooklyn, New York to Victor's recording studios in Camden, New Jersey. During this period, her most popular records were made. Sally delivered James Whitcomb Riley's dialect poems \\"The Raggedy Man\\" and \\"Our Hired Girl\\" with natural girlish charm and they were instant successes. Her recordings of Eugene Field's \\"Wynken, Blynken, and Nod\\" and \\"The Sugar Plum Tree\\" are notable for Sally's use of sprechstimme, particularly in the final stanzas which are accompanied by harpist Francis J. Lapitino. This dreamy half spoken, half sung performance is one of the earliest examples of sprechstimme in a commercial recording. Sally Hamlin, from the 1917 Victor record catalog On November 1, 1926, Sally Hamlin signed another contract with Victor, this one for a two-year period. While her earlier recordings had been made by the acoustic recording process, this group was recorded using the new electrical process, introduced in early 1925. Victor had her re-record some of her previous readings utilizing the new electrical process, and recorded some new titles such as \\"The Little Kitten That Would Not Wash Its Face\\" and Lewis Carroll's Jabberwocky. Among this group is her record of \\"The Night Before Christmas\\" and \\"The Shoemaker And The Elves\\". This record contains perhaps the first instance of sampling in a commercial recording. Sally's recordings of these two famous Christmas pieces contain musical fade-ins from other records in Victor's catalog (among them, Elsie Baker's record of \\"Silent Night\\"). Although it was surely done as a cost-cutting measure, being cheaper than hiring an orchestra or a pianist, it nevertheless is sampling by definition. None of Sally Hamlin's work has ever been officially reissued commercially on LP or compact disc. Later in life, Sally Hamlin married Karl M. Chworowsky, a minister of the Unitarian Church. They were both accomplished pianists who gave recitals together. She outlived him by 23 years, passing away at the age of 84 in Bar Harbor, Maine. She is buried in the Hamlin family plot at Mount Hope Cemetery in Bangor, Maine.

Early life: football and track achievements McCracken, nicknamed Joe, was born in Lincoln County, Tennessee. His earliest known Ulster-Scots ancestors settled in Pennsylvania before the French and Indian War. When McCracken was eight years old, his parents moved to Garnett, Kansas, and by the age of 17, the family was living in Sterling, Kansas. McCracken excelled at both football and track and field while a school boy in Kansas. He was heavily recruited by the University of Kansas, Cornell University, and the University of Pennsylvania. The 1896 Kansas Jayhawks football team was coached was Hector Cowan a Princeton University graduate, an 1889 College Football All-America Team selection, and a future member of the College Football Hall of Fame. In addition to coaching football, Cowan was a Presbyterian minister. McCracken was raised in a devout Presbyterian family. After living on the plains of Kansas for 14 years, McCracken transferred in 1896 from Cooper College, a Presbyterian institution known today as Sterling College, along with University of Kansas transfer John Outland, to attend the University of Pennsylvania and played football under future College Football Hall of Fame coach George Washington Woodruff. Both McCracken and Outland graduated from Penn with degrees in medicine. Unlike Cornell and Penn, the University of Kansas did not have a medical school in 1896. While at Penn, McCracken was an all around student athlete, playing varsity football four years, track four years (captain his senior year) and was a member of the gymnastics team. McCracken was named to Walter Camp's College All American football team on three occasions. He was a third-team All American in 1897; a second-team All American in 1898 and in 1899 a first-team All American. McCracken played primarily as an offensive fullback and defensive guard. During 1899 he played alongside Outland and A. R. Kennedy, another transfer students from the University of Kansas football program. McCracken, Outland and Kennedy were known around Philadelphia's Franklin Field as the \\"Kansas Musketeers\\". During McCracken's four years of playing football at Penn (1897‚Äì1900) the football team compiled a 47‚Äì5‚Äì2 record. On May 31, 1898, McCracken set a world record in the hammer throw with a distance of 46.83m (153‚Äì8 ft) at a meet in New Jersey. After college, he won a silver and bronze medal at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris. McCracken was elected president of his class all four years at Penn, was president of the Christian Association three years, president of the Houston Club one year, and an associate editor of the student newspaper, The Pennsylvanian. A New York Times article of April 11, 1901 described him as \\"the University of Pennsylvania's best all around athlete and the most popular man at the university...\\" When McCracken graduated in 1901 with his medical degree and received his diploma, the whole audience rose to their feet and loudly applauded, an ovation never before given in the history of the university. 1900 Olympics McCracken's previous world record in the hammer throw earned him a spot on the U.S. Olympic team and a trip to the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris. During the Paris Olympics, The New York Times reported on July 16, 1900, that the French Olympic Committee had shifted several final events to Sunday and that American athletes including Josiah McCracken from Penn and Robert Garrett from Princeton University refused for religious reasons to compete in any Olympic events that were scheduled on Sunday. McCracken and Garrett were replaced with athletes from Hungary and Greece. Richard Sheldon also representing the USA, elected to participate on Sunday and won the gold medal in the shot put. Fortunately, McCracken's and Garrett's Saturday qualifying results in the shot put were good enough to earn them silver and bronze medals respectively in the shot put event. McCracken also received the bronze medal in the hammer throw. Later life After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, McCracken remained involved in college football as both a game official and coach. During his medical residency and internship period, McCracken was a football referee, linesman or time-keeper for many Ivy League varsity games, including the Harvard vs. Yale games of 1902 and 1904. In 1903, he returned to Kansas for one season as the Cooper College football coach. McCracken Field at Sterling College's Smisor Stadium is named in his honor. Also in 1903, three Penn 1900 Olympic athletes‚Äî Alexander Grant, George W. Orton and Joe McCracken‚Äîestablished Camp Tecumseh, a residential summer camp in New Hampshire for young men. The camp's mission now as it was then, is \\"to make good boys better\\" through healthy athletic competition. McCracken completed his medical internship at Columbia University and his medical residency at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. In 1906, the University of Pennsylvania Christian Association sent McCracken to China to establish a Christian medical school in Canton. McCracken served as president of the University Medical School in Canton from 1907 to 1913 and then as dean of the University of Pennsylvania Medical School of China (later part of St. John's University in Shanghai) from 1914 to 1942. McCracken spent a total of 36 years in China training Chinese doctors and improving existing medical schools. When the Japanese occupied China in 1942, McCracken and his family were expelled and placed aboard an Italian ship in Shanghai. Their escape from China required the assistance of the Swiss Consulate. Their passage home took them down the coast of southeastern Asia, across the Indian Ocean to Mozambique, Africa. In Mozambique they were transferred to a Swedish ship that took them around the Cape of Good Hope to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and finally to New York. During World War II McCracken served as a Major in the U.S. Public Health Reserves. Joe's wife Helen and his daughter Mary both died in the United States during the war. After the war McCracken returned to Shanghai for another year before having to return to the United States for health reasons. During retirement McCracken continued to raise funds for the hospitals and medical schools in China until the takeover in 1952 by the communist government. The McCracken's had eight children, seven whom were born in China. A son of Joe and Helen, Josiah C. McCracken Jr., was a Penn football running back in the 1930s,whose nickname was the \\"Shanghai Express.\\" During World War II Joe Jr. rose to the rank of Major in the U.S. Army Medical Corps and received the Bronze Star for his service in the southwest Pacific. In May 1952 Joe Sr. returned to Kansas to visit relatives and the graves of his parents. While in Sterling he decided to sell his parents' farm. He donated the proceeds from the sale of the family farm to Sterling College in appreciation for what the school had done for him and other young people since then. Joe McCracken Sr. died in Chestnut Hill, Pennsylvania, on February 15, 1962, at nearly 88 years of age, and is buried alongside his wife Helen and daughter Dr. Mary McCracken in Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx, NY. Also buried in Woodlawn Cemetery are several of his distant relatives who had changed the spelling of the McCracken surname to MacCracken, including Henry Mitchell MacCracken, Chancellor of New York University, who conceived the idea of a Hall of Fame for Great Americans; and his sons Henry Noble MacCracken, President of Vassar College; and John Henry MacCracken, President of Lafayette College. On May 23, 1956, Joe was elected to the University of Pennsylvania Track Hall of Fame. On November 11, 2000, he was inducted into the University of Pennsylvania Athletic Hall of Fame. During 2008 the University of Pennsylvania Christian Association established the Dr. Josiah C. McCracken Society. In 2010 Joe McCracken was nominated for induction into the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame so he could take his place alongside the other two Kansas Musketeers Kennedy and Outland who had been inducted in 1974.

V. Prasad, S. Naga Ashok Kumar on Sri Sai Deva Productions banner and directed by Sri Raghava. The film stars Venkatesh, Trisha in the lead roles and music composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja. The film's title is inspired from a song in Kushi and its original version from Missamma. The film was released theatrically on 27 April 2007 and became a high commercial success. It was also a critically success, winning three Nandi Awards and one Filmfare Award. Following its success, the film was remade in Tamil as Yaaradi Nee Mohini, in Bengali as 100% Love, in Bhojpuri as Mehndi Laga Ke Rakhna, in Kannada as Anthu Inthu Preethi Banthu and in Odia as Prema Adhei Akshyara.  Plot  Ganesh (Venkatesh) is from a middle-class family. He makes several bids to obtain employment but all in vain due to his poor language skills and inadequate educational qualifications. All his friends settle in life, but he continues to struggle in finding employment. Ganesh has two best friends Vasu (Sriram), and Seenu (Sunil). His father (Kota Srinivasa Rao), who is a teacher, is always critical of him for being an irresponsible person. This just added to his list of woes. At this juncture, Ganesh catches a glimpse of Keerthi (Trisha) and immediately falls in love with her. He learns that she works for a software solutions firm. Luckily, Ganesh finally secures employment in the same firm. Keerthi eventually turns out to be a short-tempered young woman. On a business trip, Ganesh accompanies her along with two other colleagues (Jeeva and another person to Australia. Here he reveals his feelings of love to her. She immediately turns him down, saying that she comes from an orthodox family, and her marriage has already been arranged with her cousin. Ganesh returns India in a depressed manner. Unable to see his son in depression, Ganesh's father tries to convince her. But, she insults him for recommending his son's love and accidentally slaps both Ganesh and his father. Later that night, Ganesh's father dies of a heart attack. Ganesh again goes into depression. In order to change Ganesh's mood, Vasu manages to persuade him to come along to his family house in the country. Coincidentally, on the train journey, Keerthi is revealed to be Vasu's fianc√©e. However, their grandfather's (K. Viswanath) intention of getting them married earlier is put aside because Vasu and Keerthi leave the house to make their own identity. This causes heartache to their grandfather. With the passing of a few days, the parents of Keerthi and Vasu decide to get them married to appease their grandfather. After several turns of events, Keerthi realizes that she is in love with Ganesh. Ganesh asks her to forget him, during a late night meeting, because he believes that it would create problems in their happy family. Keerthi's grandfather notices them conversing and admonishes Keerthi for bringing disrepute to their family and asks Ganesh to leave his village. Ganesh gets ready to leave when he sees everyone putting down the decorations for the wedding. Vasu tells him to go away, but Ganesh begs him to marry Keerthi. While Ganesh is on his way, the bunch of goons he saved the family from, sticks a knife in him and he is taken to the hospital. Seenu sarcastically tells Vasu that he forgot that Vasu doesn't like Ganesh. Everyone slowly leaves to go to the hospital, except Keerthi and her grandfather. Keerthi says that she will never disobey her grandfather. Afterward, Keerthi and her grandfather go to the hospital and Ganesh wakes up to go to the railway station. He sees that everyone is outside his room and he also sees Keerthi and Vasu's grandfather. In time, the rest of Ganesh and Keerthi's family comes to stay with Ganesh for a few days. The movie ends when Ganesh and Keerthi became a happy couple and live together happily.  Cast  * Venkatesh as Ganesh * Trisha as Keerti / Kusumamba * Sriram as Vasu * K.

United States, 234 U.S. 342 (1914), also known as Shreveport Rate Case, was a decision of the United States Supreme Court expanding the power of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution of the United States. Justice Hughes's majority opinion stated that the federal government's power to regulate interstate commerce also allowed it to regulate purely intrastate commerce in cases where control of the former was not possible without control of the latter. Because the Supreme Court consolidated several related appeals, they are sometimes collectively known as the \\"Shreveport Rate Cases\\" although the Supreme Court issued only one ruling. Background The Houston East and West Texas Railway Company managed an interstate railway line that ran through Dallas and Marshall, Texas (on the eastern border of Texas), and Shreveport, Louisiana. The freight shipping rates \\"on wagons\\" from Marshall to Dallas, a distance of 148 miles, was 36.8 cents, and the rate from Marshall to Shreveport, a distance of 42 miles, was 56 cents; the rates for other goods and from other points in Texas showed a similar imbalance. Shreveport competed with Dallas for shipments from East Texas, but the skewed price structure (mandated by the Texas Railroad CommissionHouston E. & W. T. Ry. Co. v. United States, .), greatly favored shipments to and from Dallas over Shreveport. The Interstate Commerce Commission, acting on a complaint from the Railroad Commission of Louisiana,234 U.S. at 345. found that \\"an unlawful and undue preference and advantage\\" was thereby given to the Texas cities,234 U.S. at 347. ordered the company to change the rate structure to end discriminatory pricing.234 U.S. at 348. The Tenth Amendment reserves for the states or the people all powers not expressly delegated to the federal government. The US Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce. The regulation of commerce that is completely within a state is not an enumerated power of the federal government. In effect, the Interstate Commerce Commission was attempting to set the rate that the railroad could charge from Dallas to Marshall, a section of rail line completely within the borders of Texas. The issue was thus whether \\"Congress is impotent to control the intrastate charges of an interstate carrier\\" or whether Congress could go further or if it was necessary to regulate interstate commerce. Decision Associate Justice Charles Evans Hughes, writing for the majority, rejected the railroad's argument, finding that congressional authority \\"necessarily embraces the right to control... operations in all matters having a close and substantial relation to interstate traffic, to the efficiency of interstate service, and to the maintenance of conditions under which interstate commerce may be conducted upon fair terms.\\"234 U.S. at 351. Regulation of the intrastate line was a means to the end of regulating interstate commerce, and was therefore allowed. Two justices, Lurton and Pitney, dissented without issuing a written opinion.234 U.S. at 360. Legacy The Interstate Commerce Clause has been used to steadily expand the power of the federal government, as almost any aspect of life, especially after the industrial revolution, can in some way be related to interstate commerce. The Shreveport Rate Case was an early example of this expansion. As a leading case in the ability of governments to regulate activities occurring only within single subdivisions, on the grounds that those activities affect regulation on a larger scale, the Shreveport Rate Cases have been cited in many subsequent rulings, both in the United States and in other countries.E.g., http://vlex.com/search/index?query%5Blc_query%5D=citas%3A%28CITA_LEY_20030320%29 See also * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 234 References Further reading   External links  Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the White Court Category:United States Commerce Clause case law Category:History of Shreveport, Louisiana Category:1914 in United States case law Category:Southern Pacific Railroad Category:Interstate Commerce Commission litigation Category:Railway litigation in 1914 Category:Railroad Commission of Texas ","title":"Houston East &amp; West Texas Railway Co. v.

What is an agent? For the purpose of this discussion, an agent is a software program (sometimes called a service or daemon) that runs on a computer with the primary purpose of collecting information and pushing it over the network to a central location (or else of re-publishing the information in a standard format like SNMP so that it can then be collected over the network from the central location). The traditional approach to data collection involves installing agents on all computers from which data is needed. Sometimes this installation step is performed manually for each computer, other times it is automated via a centralized installation server that pushes software to other computers. In either case, the cost of installation (and subsequent maintenance and upgrade) is typically proportional to the number of computers that require installation services, and this is in turn equal to the number of computers from which data is needed. Agentless approach In the agentless approach, data is collected from computers without installing additional agents. This is accomplished by obtaining data from the software that is already installed on the computer including the operating system as well as previously-installed commercial products (or commercial products which do not require an installation to execute). It turns out that, in many cases, there are already more than enough programs and protocols installed on a computer where the desired information can be obtained. The primary benefit of the agentless approach is that it is not necessary to install, upgrade and maintain additional software programs on each computer from which information is needed. Software products that use this approach may have a faster rollout and lower TCO than software products that require agents on a substantial number of computers. Relevant network protocols Any network protocol that returns useful information can be employed, providing only that the protocol server is already installed. Again, the distinction between agentless and agent-based is not the specific protocol used but whether a new protocol server (agent) must be installed. In many cases, it is possible to find servers for these protocols: log4j, CIFS, SSH, SNMP, Windows Management Instrumentation (for Windows platform), DTrace (for Solaris 10 platform). However, a large number of other protocols may be helpful as well. Versus data mining The meaning of the phrase data mining is related to but different from data collection. The former is typically about finding useful patterns with data that is conveniently accessible in a relational database. In contrast, the latter involves extracting data from a variety of less convenient sources, although in some cases it may also involve identifying or leveraging useful patterns.

Filmography Farewell to Hollywood (2014, 102 minutes, co- directed with Regina Nicholson) In a recurring poetic image, 17-year-old Regina Diane Nicholson swings between heaven and earth on a breathtakingly high cliff by the sea. Reggie is a tomboy struggling with cancer, her parents and her dream of making a film. She impresses us with her loving, strong personality and wisdom beyond her years, as well as her morbid sense of humor. Together with director Henry Corra, she is working on a portrait of herself and her struggle with her illness. The film‚Äôs initial focus is on Reggie, but it quickly makes way for an escalating conflict between her and her parents as Reggie develops a closer relationship with Henry, who takes her seriously. When Reggie turns 18 and can make decisions on her own, things become even more intense. This film is a poetic fairytale about love and death, holding on and letting go, one that invites us to discuss the relationship between the maker, subject and family. An eclectic mix of images with the intimacy of a video diary or home movie, it is filmed both by Henry and by Reggie and supplemented by their text message exchanges, images from her favorite movies, and fairytale-like scenes with songs that together form a heartwarming, but also heartbreaking and controversial ode to Reggie.

The Constitution was repealed by the Council for Democratic Reform on 19 September 2006 following a successful military coup, and was replaced by the 2006 Constitution on 1 October 2006. The 1997 Constitution was the first constitution to be drafted by a popularly elected Constitutional Drafting Assembly, hence was popularly called the \\"People's Constitution\\".Kittipong Kittayarak, The Thai Constitution of 1997 and its Implication on Criminal Justice Reform The 1997 Constitution created a bicameral legislature. For the first time in Thai history, both houses were directly elected. Many human rights are explicitly acknowledged in the text, and measures were established to increase the stability of elected governments. Constitution drafting process The \\"Black May\\" public uprising against a military-dominated government that gained power due to the 1991 Constitution provoked public calls for a more accountable system of government. In June 1994, the Committee of Democracy Development of the House of Representatives was established during the government of Chuan Leekpai. Chuan was forced to establish the Committee following a hunger strike by prominent activist Chalard Vorachat.Thanet Aphornsuvan, The Search for Order: Constitutions and Human Rights in Thai Political History , 2001 Symposium: Constitutions and Human Rights in a Global Age: An Asia Pacific perspective The Committee, headed by academic Prawase Wasi, amended the 1991 Constitution but was unable to push through further reform. However, it did identify many basic frameworks which would become influential for subsequent political change.Committee of Democracy Development, \\"The Propositions and Conceptual Framework of Thai Political Reform\\", 1995, Thai Research Fund After the collapse of the Chuan government, the 1995-1996 government of Banharn Silpa- archa established a Political Reform Committee which amended the Constitution again on 22 October 1996. Efforts to adopt a new constitution gained increasing public support. On 2 November 1995, noted royalist and social critic Dr. Prawase Wasi declared to a crowded Bangkok ballroom that Thailand urgently needed a new constitution, to help avert the potential calamity of political violence that might follow the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej. None of the media outlets in the room dared report this highly sensitive speech.Duncan McCargo, \\"A Hollow Crown\\", New Left Review 43 (January‚ÄìFebruary 2007) The 1996 amendment called for the creation of an entirely new constitution by a special committee outside the National Assembly. The Constitution Drafting Assembly (CDA) was formed with 99 members: seventy-six of them directly elected from each of the provinces and 23 qualified persons short-listed by the Parliament from academia and other sources.Borwornsak Uwanno and Wayne D. Burns, The Thai Constitution of 1997 Sources and Process, part 2 Anand Panyarachun, Premier in 1991 under the military regime, was selected as a member of the CDA and appointed Chairman of the Drafting Committee. Political scientists and jurists Chai-Anan Samudavanija, Amorn Chantarasomboon, Uthai Pimchaichon, and Borwornsak Uwanno were key influencers of the draft. A process of public consultation took place on a nationwide basis. Some clauses, particularly the requirement that all MP's hold bachelor's degrees, the party list system, the Constitutional Court, and decentralisation provoked strong criticism, particularly from smaller parties. The Asian Economic Crisis of 1997 increased public awareness about the need for reform, and has been cited as an impetus for the constitution's successful approval. The draft was approved by the National Assembly with 518 votes for, 16 against, and 17 abstentions. A referendum, called for if the draft was rejected by the National Assembly, was not necessary.Duncan McCargo, The 19 September 2006 coup ‚Äì preliminary thoughts on the implications for the future direction of Thai politics, 12 October 2006 Overview of sections The 1997 Constitution had 12 Chapters and a section of Transitory Provisions, containing a total of 317 Sections.Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand, enacted 1997, official translation by the Office of the Council of State * Chapter 1 (Sections 1-7): General provisions, the source and exercise sovereign power, the fundamental rights of the Thai people, and the status of the Constitution. * Chapter 2 (Sections 8-25): The status, prerogative, rights of the King, the Privy Council, as well as matters of succession to the throne. * Chapter 3 (Sections 26-65): The rights and liberties of the Thai people. * Chapter 4 (Sections 66-70): The duties of the Thai people. * Chapter 5 (Sections 71-89): The fundamental responsibilities of the state. * Chapter 6 (Sections 90-200): The structure, roles, and responsibilities of the National Assembly (i.e., Parliament), including the House of Representatives, the Senate, elections and the Election Commission, the Ombudsmen, and the National Human Rights Commission. * Chapter 7 (Sections 201-232): The Council of Ministers (i.e., the Cabinet) and the workings of the executive branch. * Chapter 8 (Sections 233-281): The workings of the Courts of Justice, the Constitutional Court, the Administrative Courts, and the Military Courts. * Chapter 9 (Sections 282-290): The workings of local governments * Chapter 10 (Sections 291-311): Inspection and proceedings against members of the government, including the declaration of accounts and assets, the National Counter Corruption Commission, and impeachment of and criminal proceedings against government and political officials. * Chapter 11 (Section 312): The roles and responsibilities of the State Audit Commission and the Auditor- General. * Chapter 12 (Section 313): Regulations concerning amendment of the Constitution. * Transitory Provisions (Sections 314-317): Regulations concerning the transfer of power from the last government of the 1991 Constitution. Key features Innovations Compared to previous Thai constitutions, The 1997 Constitution had contained several innovations in key areas, including: * Election reform. Voting was made compulsory in order to ensure a high turnout and make vote buying so expensive as to be unfeasible. An Additional Member System, based on that used in Germany, was adopted for the House of Representatives. 100 members of the House are elected by proportional rule from party lists using the d'Hondt method, and the remaining 400 are elected by first-past-the-post from single-member constituencies. The proportional representation party list system was aimed at deterring vote- buying, strengthening the party system, and increasing the quality of candidates. MPs were required to have a bachelor's degree. In order to prevent last-minute party-switching, MPs were required to be registered members of political parties at least 90 days before the election date. An independent Election Commission was established. Votes for House elections were counted at a central site in each province rather than at each polling station. This reform made it more difficult for village canvassers to evaluate the effectiveness of vote boying.Alec Bamford and Chanida Chanyapate, Thailand: Democracy, Elections, and Legitimacy , 5 May 2006Aurel Croissant and Daniel J. Pojar, Jr., Quo Vadis Thailand? Thai Politics after the 2005 Parliamentary Election , Strategic Insights, Volume IV, Issue 6 (June 2005) * Strengthening the executive branch. A two-fifths vote of the House was required for a vote of no confidence debate to be initiated against a Prime Minister. The motion must also contain the name of an alternative Premier to replace the incumbent. A successful vote of no confidence required a majority of at least half of the House. A similar process could initiate a no-confidence motion against an individual Minister; this required only one-fifth of the signatures of the House members. These measures were aimed at increasing the stability of governments.Borwornsak Uwanno and Wayne D. Burns, The Thai Constitution of 1997 Sources and Process, part 1 * Legislative reform. For the first time in Thai history, the upper house of Parliament was directly elected. The 200-member body was non-partisan, and Senators were prohibited from being members of a political party. In addition, Senate elections campaigns were strictly limited in what information they could communicate to voters. Senators were elected to a term of six years. The Senate could only amend or approve a piece of legislation, not propose it. A vote of two-thirds of both houses was needed to override a royal veto. The Senate could not be dissolved by the Premier.Bienvenue au S√©nat, S√©nats du Monde, Thailand Senate * Greater separation between the executive and legislative branches. MPs were forced to resign from the House in order to become Cabinet Ministers, unlike previous constitutions. Based on the principle of \\"individual ministerial responsibility and cabinet collective responsibility\\", this forced Ministers who had been successfully censured to become normal citizens rather than MPs. It also encouraged parties to put potential ministers on the party list rather than a particular constituency.Prudisan Jumbala, \\"Thailand: Constitutional Reform Amidst Economic Crisis\\", Southeast Asian Affairs, Singapore, 1998, page 269 * Human rights. Myriad human rights were explicitly recognized for the first time, including the rights of children, the elderly, and the handicapped; the right to freedom of information; the right to public health and free education; consumers' rights; the rights of traditional communities; the right to human dignity; and the right to peacefully protest coups and other extra-constitutional means of acquiring power. However, constitutional law expert Prinya Thaewanarumitkul claimed that the right to resist coups, for example by making barricades or blocking roads, would only protect people if the opposition to the coup was successful.The Nation, Law expert warns of recurring cycle of coups, charter rewrites, 29 September 2006 In addition, traditional human rights were guaranteed, including freedom of speech, assembly, and association, property rights, freedom of religion, the right to due process of law, the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, and equality of rights between men and women. In all, the 1997 Constitution guaranteed 40 human rights; in comparison, the 1932 Constitution protected nine. * Decentralization of government. Elected Tambon Administrative Organizations (TAOs) and Provincial Administrative Organizations (PAOs) were established. School administration was also decentralized, although opposition from teachers has delayed implementation of this reform. * Increased checks and balances. New independent government agencies were established, like the Constitutional Court, the Administrative Court, the Office of the Auditor- General, the National Anti-Corruption Commission, the National Human Rights Commission, the Consumers' Protection Organization, the Environmental Conservation Organization, and an Ombudsman. Many of these appointments were approved by the Senate. Most of these Constitutional agencies were abolished following the 2006 coup. * Criminal justice reforms. This included a reduction in police authority to conduct warrantless search, the right to prompt court arraignment within 48 hours of arrest, a more transparent bail procedure, and the right to counsel during police interrogations. Succession Like most preceding constitutions, the 1997 Constitution continued to rely on the 1924 Palace Law of Succession with regards to succession. The Palace Law was based on primogeniture, and the heir apparent was Prince Vajiralongkorn. As with most post-1974 constitutions, the Privy Council could appoint a princess as successor to the throne, but only in the absence of an heir apparent. Amendment of the Palace Law of Succession was the sole prerogative of the reigning King.Aryan, Gothan (September 15‚Äì16, 2004), Thai Monarchy , International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, Retrieved on 05 July 2006, presented in Kathmandu, NepalPaul M. Handley, \\"The King Never Smiles\\" Yale University Press: 2006, Paul Handley, What the Thai coup was really about, 6 November 2006 The 1997 Constitution's successor, the 2006 Interim Constitution, was conspicuous in its failure to mention the matter of succession. Praise and criticism The Constitution was calling a \\"revolution in Thai politics... A bold attempt at conferring greater power to the Thai people than had ever been granted before.\\"Paul Chambers, Good governance, political stability, and constitutionalism in Thailand 2002: The state of democratic consolidation five years after the implementation of the 1997 constitution, King Prajadhipok‚Äôs Institute, 10 August 2002 It was highly praised for the participative process involved in its drafting, its enshrinement of human rights, and its significant advances in political reform. It was viewed as successful in fostering democratic development and increasing political stability.Thawilwadee Bureekul and Stithorn Thananithichot, The Thai Constitution of 1997: Evidence of Democratization Its measures to politically empower and protect citizens were also praised.Niyom Rathamarit, The 1997 Constitution: the path of reform The new constitution was cited for its role in bringing down the Ministers of Public Health and Agriculture during corruption scandals in the government of Chuan Leekpai. There was also praise for the ease with which the constitution could be amended. Public faith in democracy in general, and in constitutional agencies like the Constitutional Court and the National Anti-Corruption Commission, was very high.Robert B. Albritton and Thawilwadee Bureekul, Developing Democracy under a New Constitution in Thailand , National Taiwan University and Academia Sinica Asian Barometer Project Office Working Paper Series No. 28, 2004 However, critics complained that the government had sought to politicize the process of appointments to independent agencies.Duncan McCargo, Countries at the Crossroads 2006, Country Report - Thailand, Freedom House The January 2001 House elections, the first House elections contested under the 1997 Constitution, were called the most open, corruption-free elections in Thai history. Political parties were effectively strengthened, and the effective number of parties in the legislature fell dramatically from an average of 6.2 before 1997 to 3.1 in 2001.Allen Hicken, Thailand: Combating Corruption through Electoral Reform While the number of parties decreased, remaining parties developed clearer and more distinguishable platforms. The Constitution also weakened the legislative influence of civil servants and local power- brokers and businessmen, while strengthening political parties and professional politicians. Most criticism was based on the view that the Constitution was too effective in some of its reforms. One of the members of the Drafting Committee, Amorn Chantarasomboon, claimed that an overly strong and stable government brought on a \\"tyranny of the majority\\" and a \\"parliamentary dictatorship.\\"The Nation, \\"Thai Talk: Third party ‚Äì not such a wild idea , 15 April 2004 Independent agencies like the National Human Rights Commission and the National Anti-Corruption Commission were also criticized as weak and vulnerable to government and court challenges. Following House elections in April 2006, the Election Commissioners were jailed and the election results overturned by the Constitutional Court. The constitution was also criticized for the lack of clarity with which it defines the King's role in politics (see Royal powers and 2006 demand for royal intervention). The Senate's role in scrutinizing Constitutional Court appointments came under much criticism (see Appointment of the first Constitutional Court). The Senate was criticized for its allegedly partisan behavior, with both pro- and anti- government factions being elected in the Senate elections of 2006.Xinhua, New Senate election casts shadow on political prospect in Thailand Restrictions on campaigning and political party membership for members of the Senate led one commentator to call it a \\"motley collection of B-list celebrities and D-list hangers-on.\\" In House elections in April 2006, a constitutional crisis almost occurred when it appeared that the Parliament would not be able to convene within the constitutional time limit (see April 2006 House election results). Thammasat University law lecturer Kittisak Prokati, a drafter of the post-2006 coup constitution, claimed that \\"the weakness of the 1997 constitution was that it was a charter without any constitutional or theoretical foundation.\\"The Nation, 'Thaksin's ghost haunts drafters' , 12 March 2007 Although constitutional articles (specifically, article 80) committing the state the promoting equal rights between men and women, there was little progress in implementing specific laws to promote equality. In practice only around 10% of MPs and senators are female, and less than 6% of ministers.King Prajadhipok's Institute, \\"Monitoring the Pulse of the Nation: Indicators of Good Governance and Development in Thailand\\", 2003 Only 8.9% of district officers and 2.6% of provincial governors are women.

Unlike most other analog echo machines, they used an analog magnetic drum recorder instead of a tape loop. After using Meazzi Echomatic machines successfully to establish his signature sound, Hank Marvin of The Shadows began using Binson echoes. He used various Binson units on record and stage for much of the mid-to-late 1960s, in conjunction with Vox AC30 amplifiers and Burns London guitars. Marvin continued to use Binsons until c.1979/1980, when he began using the Roland RE-201 echo. Binson units were used to great effect by Pink Floyd's original frontman Syd Barrett and then guitarist David Gilmour, but also by keyboardist Richard Wright. The classic Binson delay effect can be heard on songs such as \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\", \\"Astronomy Domine\\", \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" and \\"Time\\". Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin also used a Binson echo unit which was used on the drums in \\"When the Levee Breaks.\\" Binson echo units were also used by Hawkwind, and more recently by Tarantula Hawk. Jon Courtney of British nu-prog band Pure Reason Revolution is also a frequent user of the Binson units. Another prominent use of the Tape Delay was in the Goth Rock staple Bela Lugosi's Dead by Bauhaus. In Pink Floyd's 23-minute-long song \\"Echoes\\", Roger Waters used a Binson Echorec to create the eerie underwater wind noise heard during the first interlude (10:40-15:02 on studio recordings, underneath the screaming whale (?) song produced by Gilmour); he vibrated the strings of his bass guitar with a steel slide and fed the sound through the Echorec. Waters reproduced this sound during live performances. \\"One of These Days\\", a song written in the same period as \\"Echoes\\", features the effect prominently on the bass part that plays throughout the song. The Binson Echorec was a major part of the early Pink Floyd sound, until they started to use the VCS3 synthesizer in 1972.

Partly inspired by Gamal Abdel Nasser's pan-Arab nationalism, it began on 14 October 1963 with the throwing of a grenade at a gathering of British officials at Aden Airport. A state of emergency was then declared in the British Crown colony of Aden and its hinterland, the Aden Protectorate. The emergency escalated in 1967 and hastened the end of British rule in the territory which had begun in 1839. On 30 November 1967, British forces withdrew and the independent People's Republic of South Yemen was proclaimed. Background Aden was originally of interest to Britain as an anti-piracy station to protect shipping on the routes to British India. With the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, it further served as a coaling station. Following the independence of India in 1947, Aden became less important to the United Kingdom. The Emergency was precipitated in large part by a wave of Arab nationalism spreading to the Arabian Peninsula and stemming largely from the socialist and pan-Arabist doctrines of Egyptian leader Gamel Abdel Nasser. The British, French and Israeli forces that had invaded Egypt following Nasser's nationalisation of the Suez Canal in 1956 had been forced to withdraw following intervention from both the United States and the Soviet Union. Nasser enjoyed only limited success in spreading his pan-Arabist doctrines through the Arab world, with his 1958 attempt to unify Egypt and Syria as the United Arab Republic collapsing in failure three years later. A perceived anti-colonial uprising in Aden in 1963 provided another potential opportunity for his doctrines, though it is not clear to what extent Nasser directly incited the revolt in Aden, as opposed to the Yemeni guerrilla groups drawing inspiration from Nasser's pan-Arabist ideas but acting independently themselves. Emergency By 1963 and in the ensuing years, anti-British guerrilla groups with varying political objectives began to coalesce into two larger, rival organisations: first the Egyptian-supported National Liberation Front (NLF) and then the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen (FLOSY), who attacked each other as well as the British. Hostilities commence Hostilities started on 14 December 1963, with an NLF grenade attack against British High Commissioner of Aden Sir Kennedy Trevaskis, which took place as he arrived at Khormaksar Airport to catch a London-bound flight. The grenade killed the High Commissioner's adviser and a woman, and injured fifty other people. On that day, a state of emergency was declared in Aden. Aden in 1965 The NLF and FLOSY began a campaign against British forces in Aden, relying largely on grenade attacks. One such attack was carried out against RAF Khormaksar during a children's party, killing a girl and wounding four children. The guerrilla attacks largely focused on killing off-duty British officers and policemen. Much of the violence was carried out in Crater, the old Arab quarter of Aden. British forces attempted to intercept weapons being smuggled into Crater by the NLF and FLOSY on the Dhala road, but their efforts met with little success. Despite taking a toll on British forces, the death toll among rebels was far higher, largely due to inter- factional fighting among different rebel groups. In 1964 the British 24th Infantry Brigade arrived to conduct land operations. It remained in Aden and the Aden Protectorate until November 1967. By 1965, the RAF station RAF Khormaksar was operating nine squadrons. These included transport units with helicopters and a number of Hawker Hunter fighter bomber aircraft. These were called in by the army for attacks on rebel positions in which they would use 60-pound high explosive rockets and their 30 mm ADEN cannon. Aden street riots Street riots in Aden, 1967 Aden in 1967 On 19‚Äì20 January 1967, the NLF provoked street riots in Aden. After the Aden police lost control, British High Commissioner Sir Richard Turnbull deployed British troops to crush the riots. As soon as the NLF riots were crushed, pro-FLOSY rioters took to the streets. Fighting between British forces and pro-guerrilla rioters lasted into February. British forces had opened fire 40 times, and during that period there were 60 grenade and shooting attacks against British forces, including the destruction of an Aden Airways Douglas DC-3, which was bombed in mid-air, killing all the people on board. Arab police mutiny The emergency was further exacerbated by the Six-Day War in June 1967. Nasser claimed that the British had helped Israel in the war, and this led to a mutiny by hundreds of soldiers in the South Arabian Federation Army on 20 June, which also spread to the Aden Armed Police. The mutineers killed 22 British soldiers and shot down a helicopter, and as a result, Crater was occupied by rebel forces. Concerns were heightened regarding the ability to give sufficient security to British families in the midst of the increased violence, resulting in evacuation plans for families being sped up considerably. Battle of Crater Following the mutiny, all British forces were withdrawn from Crater, while Royal Marines of 45 Commando took up sniping positions on the high ground and killed 10 armed Arab fighters. However, Crater remained occupied by an estimated 400 Arab fighters. NLF and FLOSY fighters then took to the streets and engaged in gun battles, while arson, looting, and murder was also common. British forces blocked off the two main entrances to Crater. They came under sniper fire from an Ottoman fort on Sira island, but the snipers were silenced by a shell from an armoured car. Order was restored in July 1967, when the 1st Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders entered Crater under the command of Lt. Col. Colin Campbell Mitchell and managed to occupy the entire district overnight with no casualties. Withdrawal Nevertheless, repeated guerrilla attacks by the NLF soon resumed against British forces, causing the British to leave Aden by the end of November 1967, earlier than had been planned by British Prime Minister Harold Wilson and without an agreement on the succeeding governance. Following the British departure, the NLF managed to seize power, and established the People's Republic of South Yemen. Aftermath British military casualties in the period 1963 to 1967 were 90 to 92 killedhttp://www.adenveterans.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Roll-of- Honour_1.pdf and 510 wounded. British civilian deaths were 17. Local government forces lost 17 killed and 58 wounded. Casualties among the rebel forces stood at 382 killed and 1,714 wounded according to a source.

It was founded by the Boston Men's Baseball League, the largest amateur baseball league in New England, in 2004 to raise funds to support Curt's Pitch for ALS, a charitable organization started by former Boston Red Sox pitcher, Curt Schilling. The organization supports the fight against amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This game holds the current world record for the longest exhibition baseball game ever played. Each year, over one hundred players from the Boston Men's Baseball League and other teams from the surrounding area get together in the spring to play a full 100 consecutive innings of baseball. It often takes about 36 hours to complete. Schilling's wife makes an annual appearance at the charity event, even playing a few innings on occasion. Curt Schilling personally receives the check each year for his organization. History The beginning The 100 Inning Game was first conceived in February 2004 by Brett Rudy and Mike Lembo, both members of the Boston Men's Baseball League. Through e-mail communication, the two developed the idea behind the charity event, which was to create a game that would coincide with the arrival of the newly acquired Boston Red Sox pitcher, Curt Schilling, and which would support his charitable organization, Curt's Pitch for ALS. A meeting between Brett, Mike, and the ALS Association MA Chapter ensued and a deal was quickly struck to get things underway. After some convincing to the City of Boston's Department of Conservation and Recreation a permit was issued to use Kelly Field in Hyde Park for the inaugural game - marking the first time the City of Boston had ever granted permission for an all night event to take place. A date of April 17 and 18 was decided upon, appropriately enough on 'Marathon Weekend'.\\" That first year, the players had raised over $113,000. The game was played by 180 players and took over 36 hours to complete. A check was presented by the game organizers to Curt Schilling on the field at Fenway Park later that year. Since 2005 The 2005 edition of the 100 Inning Game was played at the Campanelli Stadium in Brockton, Massachusetts and was hosted by the Brockton Rox. This year, the event collected even larger funds, with over $113,000 raised and presented to the charity by year's end. The following year, the event was played at the Hanover Insurance Park at Fitton Field stadium, located at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, the home of the Can-Am professional league Worcester Tornadoes. This year brought in an additional $85,000 to the charity, making the 3 year total of the 100 Inning Game $310,000 donated to Curt's Pitch for ALS. The 2008 game was held on August 30 and 31 at Adams Field in Ouincy, marking a change in date. The game also removed the \\"Dirty Dozen\\", the 12 people who could participate all 100 Innings. Also of note, the 2006 game was umpired by Walter Bentson, a sufferer of the disease ALS. Despite extreme difficulties imposed by the disease on his ability to umpire, he managed to remain on the crew for the duration of the game.

In Northern Ireland, it is also used to refer to the first two years of compulsory education for pupils aged 4 to 6. England Foundation Stage 1 takes place in a pre-school / childcare environment such as Nursery between the ages 3 and 4 but is non-compulsory education. Foundation Stage 2 takes place in the Reception class of an Infant or Primary school between the ages 4 and 5. It is also known as Key Stage 0 to fit in alongside key stages 1 to 4. The introduction of a Foundation Stage was a significant landmark in education. The early years were given a distinct identity, and a more detailed, focused curriculum, where the emphasis is on learning through planned play activities. In order for practitioners to plan a curriculum that will ensure attainment of the early learning goals for the majority of children at the end of the reception year, a series of stepping stones are provided. These stepping stones identify the developing knowledge, skills, understanding and attitudes that children need if they are to achieve the goals at the end of the foundation stage. For babies and children aged from birth to three, a separate framework named \\"Birth to Three Matters\\" was created to support those practitioners working with very young children and babies. Certain principles underpin the framework, for example, that parents and family are central to the well-being of the child, and that a relationship with a key person at home and in the setting is essential to young children's well-being. Most importantly, the framework emphasised that children learn most effectively when, with the support of a knowledgeable and trusted adult, they are actively involved and interested. In other words, children learn by doing rather than by being told. Timeline The Key Stages were first introduction of the National Curriculum. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) published ‚ÄúCurriculum Guidance for the Foundation Stage‚Äù in 2000, and is the document upon which all Foundation Stage provision is planned, and which outlines the expected learning for pupils of this age. In 2007, a new curriculum combining the two frameworks (Foundation Stage and Birth to Three Matters) was be introduced, with considerable training and support available to early years practitioners in all settings. This is called the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) and became statutory in September 2008. Structure The guidance states that through well-planned play, both indoors and outdoors, children can: * Explore, develop and represent learning experiences that help them make sense of the world * Practice and build up ideas, concepts and skills * Learn how to control impulses and understand the need for rules * Be alone, be alongside others, or cooperate as they talk or rehearse their feelings * Take risks and make mistakes * Think creatively and imaginatively * Communicate with others as they investigate or solve problems * Express fears or relive anxious experiences in controlled and safe situations The curriculum is organised into six areas of learning: * Personal, social and emotional development * Communication, language and literacy * Mathematical development * Knowledge and Understanding of the World * Physical development * Creative development These six areas help practitioners to plan the learning environment and the activities provided within it, but this does not mean that children learn in these separate subject-based areas. Very often, a well-planned activity can promote children‚Äôs development and understanding in several areas simultaneously.

She was a blonde, 5 feet 6 inches in height, 128 lbs., with a slender, athletic build. Her hair was chestnut brown and she had gray eyes. Silent movie actress In 1923 Hazel was selected as the prettiest woman in the motion picture capitol, Hollywood. Miss Hollywood was chosen at the annual musical comedy fete given by Hollywood painters, sculptors, writers, and composers. As tribute to Miss Keener's beauty, her bust was sculpted by sculptor Finn Haaken Frolich for the Norse club. She was a 1924 WAMPAS Baby Star, chosen among young actresses destined for stardom. Her acting career endured from 1922 through 1956. Her first role of importance came in the Harold Lloyd comedy, The Freshman (1925). Hazel played the second feminine lead. She was active as an actress in the late 1920s with roles in movies like The Gingham Girl (1927), Whispering Sage (1927), The Silent Partner (1927), and Vanishing Hoofs (1926). In the 1930s, 1940s, and early 1950s Miss Keener had small parts in approximately twenty movies. She acted in television with roles in episodes of Judge Roy Bean (1956) and Hopalong Cassidy (1954).

The Maya played instruments such as trumpets, flutes, whistles, and drums, and used music to accompany funerals, celebrations, and other rituals. Although no written music has survived, archaeologists have excavated musical instruments and painted and carved depictions of the ancient Maya that show how music was a complex element of societal and religious structure. Most of the music itself disappeared after the dissolution of the Maya courts following the Spanish Conquest. Some Mayan music has prevailed, however, and has been fused with Spanish influences. Instruments Bonampak temple room 1, file of musicians: rattle and ocarina; trumpets; and theatrical scene Important archaeological evidence of pre-Columbian Maya aerophones has been found in locations such as Tabasco, Campeche, and Jaina. Clay whistles were found in Jaina from burial sites. These whistles have mouthpieces in quadrangular, rectangular, ellipsoidal and conical shapes. Several whistles are shaped like human faces, and some are shaped like animals representing Mayan deities.Sadie 2001: 168-172 Aside from wind and percussive instruments there was not a wide variety of instruments used in classic Mayan music, as stringed instruments such as guitars were not invented in the region.Looper 2009: 58-61 Deceased rulers were often buried with musical instruments to help them pass through the underworld and to eventually be reborn.Looper 2009: 149 Trumpets There were several different types of Mayan trumpets. Some were made of clay and were relatively short, and wooden trumpets were much longer.Sadie 2001: 168-172 A wall painting dating from c. 775 CE found at the Bonampak ceremonial complex in the dense jungles of Chiapas depicts twin trumpeters standing side by side in a 12-man orchestra.Sadie 2001: 168-172 This, and other artistic depictions of Mayan trumpeters depict the lips of the players being held very tightly over the mouthpiece, suggesting that the wooden trumpets were used to blow higher overtones.Sadie 2001: 168-172 While the use of clay trumpets gradually diminished, the use of wooden trumpets persisted. \\"Long thin trumpets of hollow wood with long twisted gourds at the ends\\" still existed by the time Diego de Landa wrote his Relaci√≥n in 1566.Sadie 2001: 168-172 Flutes The Maya used many different types of flutes, some much like modern flutes and others very different. A common type of Mayan flute had a goitre chamber on the side which was used to deflect the air going into the instrument from taking a straight path. This caused the instrument to produce a sound more closely resembling that of an oboe.Sadie 2001: 168-172 Another type of flute used was a tube flute which was capable of producing 3 note chords, a role not commonly fulfilled by wind instruments.Sadie 2001: 168-172 The Maya also played the Ocarina, a small, whistle-sized Vessel flute. Depending on their construction, ocarinas were capable of producing five different pitches by way of four or five holes in the instrument. Certain studies and excavation reports of ancient Maya sites speculate that ocarinas were played during small cult rituals and burial ceremonies. Larger flutes were capable of producing more pitches. The Dresden Codex, a book that dates to the thirteenth or fourteenth century which contains 78 pages of ancient Maya hieroglyphs, depicts images of people playing drums and flutes. Template 34 of the Dresden Codex depicts the flute as an instrument associated with a fertility or thanksgiving ritual.Bourg 2005: 10-12 Percussion Bonampak temple room 1, file of musicians: portable turtle drum, standing drum, and maracas Mayan percussion commonly consisted of drums and rattles. Two of the three surviving pre-Columbian Mayan manuscripts in European libraries discuss the kayum, an upright single-headed cylindrical or kettle-shaped drum, played barehanded. The top and bottom panels in side 63 (34) of the Dresden Manuscript depict deities playing drums whose clay frames look like two arms of a candelabra. The arms are covered by a tied hide, and the base joining the two arms is filled with water, enabling the player to adjust the pitch of the drum. The Dresden Manuscript also shows an image of a deity shaking a large perforated rattle and another playing an end-blown flute. Glyphs that represent musical sound from both the drum and flute. Sadie 2001: 168-172 Large vertical drums (which the Aztecs called huehuetl) were made of wood and did not survive. The much lower standing kettle drums that have been found - often shaped like a bulbous jar on a pedestal, single or double - are earthenware. In depictions, the membrane is sometimes shown to consist of a jaguar pelt. In the Late-Postclassic Dresden Codex (34a), the drum connects to an open resonance chamber without membrane. Another type of kettle drum was portable and held under the arm.Rodens 2006 The horizontal slit-drums (tun, Aztec teponaztli) appear only after the close of the Classic Period, probably under Toltec influence. In addition there were tortoiseshell and turtleshell drums played with the hand (Herrera), or with a stick such as a deer antler. Metal instruments generally had no place in Classic Mayan music. The exception to this were pellet-bell rattles, which represented the god of death.Sadie 2001: 168-172 The hundred golden pellet- bell rattles found in 1926 at the Sacred Well at Chichen-Itza were brought to the site from afar. The Dresden and Madrid manuscripts depict gods ornamented with jingles.Sadie 2001: 168-172 Performance and religious significance Theatrical events, dance, ritual, and, to a lesser extent, even warfare would have been unthinkable without musical support.Looper 2009: 58-61 Therefore, the musical director in Yucat√°n, the holpop, was held in high esteem.Tozzer 1941: 93 Maya dictionaries, both ancient and more recent, contain many words and distinctions related to music, such as, for example, Ch ºorti º lahb \\"stroke [a drum] with the dexterity of a tortilla maker.\\"Houston et al. 2006: 255 The 16th-century Quich√©-Maya hero myth of the Popol Vuh stages the brothers Hun- Batz and Hun-Choven as flautists and singers, while describing them as patrons of the other arts as well; the Hero Twins transform them into monkeys by playing the flute and the drum and by singing a certain tune.Tedlock 1996: 91, 104-108 The musical Elder Brethren correspond to the Howler Monkey Gods of the Classic period. In the Classic and Late-Preclassic Periods, the Tonsured Maize God - another deity of the arts - is intimately connected to a small, portable turtle drum; the deity of the day Ik' (Wind) is sometimes shown as a musician shaking rattles. Particularly the drums, whether the slit-drum, the kettle drum, or the high wooden drum, appear with specific rhythmical motifs to have initiated the musical performances, or, as Ger√≥nimo de Mendieta states in writing about the native music of New Spain, \\"when the dancers hear that the kettle drums [atabales] start, they understand by their tone the song and the dance, and then start it.\\"Mendieta 1870, Libro II, Cap. XXXI According to Cogolludo, the holpop was not only \\"the principal singer who sets the key and teaches what is necessary to sing,\\" but also the keeper of the musical instruments, first of all the [horizontal] tunkul drums.Tozzer 1941: 93 In the Rabinal Ach√≠, a Highland Maya 'tun-dance' drama dating back to the 16th century, the stage and music director is usually the one who plays the ancient wooden slit-drum (tun), accompanied by two trumpets. The most complete depiction of a Classical period musical performance is that on the lower walls of a Bonampak temple room (room 1). Dating back to AD 791, it shows a royal dance accompanied by a file of twelve musicians divided into sections: pairs of large rattles (5 players) - a high, vertical drum (1 player) - large, portable turtle/tortoise drums played with sticks (3 players) - long trumpets (2 players) - rattle and ocarina (1 player). In between the turtle drums and the trumpets is a group of five theatrical impersonators surrounding a young noblewoman. The trumpets may have started, with the standing drum then assuming the lead part. Among the Maya, group dances were considered highly sacred. According to Bishop Diego de Landa groups of men and women danced separately and had particular musical ceremonies in which they specialized. De Landa described a dance in which two men led the steps. One hurled reeds at the other man for him to catch, while they both performed complicated dance steps. Landa also witnessed a sacred war dance, in which as many as 800 men carrying small banners followed a complex pattern of steps in perfect unison.Phillips 2005: 126-127 Some of the earliest known Mayan dances were associated with shamanistic rituals and altered states of conscious. Dance may have been a way of giving sacred beings life and voice through the dancer's movement and song. Combined with music and the fragrance of burning offerings, dance was often regarded as the direct manifestation of supernatural forces.Looper 2009: 224 Mayan music today Indigenous Mayan music can still be heard today in the Yucat√°n and the Chiapas. The tunkul (a slit drum) and the bulalek (water drum) are played in the Yucat√°n during Christian religious festivities. The Tzotzil and Tz√®ltal are groups of indigenous people located in the highlands of Chiapas who have retained a great variety of traditional Mayan dances, accompanied by a combination of indigenous instruments and European instruments. One dance includes the danza del agua, (water dance) of San Juan Chamula, accompanied by a double-headed cylindrical drum and a 12-string guitar. This dance is performed at Catholic ceremonies. Other dances of this region include the yojualelvinajil, accompanied by a harp and 12-string guitar, and the quintajimoltic, a carnival dance accompanied by a single-headed drum and a cane flute. The drum is made out of a clay pot with a single skin head covering the mouth of the pot.Sadie 2001: 168-170 A regional music known as jarana is played today in the Yucat√°n. Jarana has strong European roots, emphasized by the presence of brass bands and Hemiola rhythms.Jaranas are danced to in order to honor patron saints at Christian festivities, and are still performed at certain Maya rituals in honor of ancient Mayan deities, such as Chaac, the Mayan god of rain. Christian practices have been integrated into Mayan rituals. Another style of music is called son de maya pax, played in Quintana Roo, accompanied by violins, cornets, snare drums and bass drums.Sadie 2001: 170 In the Guatemalan highlands, the Colonial and post-Colonial music of the Spanish has fused with indigenous Maya music. This syncretic music is used to accompany dance plays, and Maya communal performance events involving dance, theatre, and music. There are several types of highland Guatemalan dance plays, and each play is characterized by a theme (i.e. conquest, hunting, and sacrifice.) Today these performance events are called bailes and they are performed at a town's central church during festivals honoring saints.Cecil 2009: 280-284 One of these dances is the K ºiche º Warrior Dance, dating back to the Postclassic era. This dance was accompanied by flutes and drums and was a pre-battle music and dance ceremony. It is thought that flutes, drums, and shells were sounded during battles in the Guatemalan highlands. Other dances include the deer dance, Baile del Venado which pairs an indigenous hunting theme with Western musical instruments such as the marimba.Cecil 2009: 280-284 Notes References *Bourg, Cameron Hideo.

It claims that our environment is one which we selectively create through our capacities to interact with the world. \\"Organisms do not passively receive information from their environments, which they then translate into internal representations. Natural cognitive systems...participate in the generation of meaning ...engaging in transformational and not merely informational interactions: they enact a world.\\" These authors suggest that the increasing emphasis upon enactive terminology presages a new era in thinking about cognitive science. How the actions involved in enactivism relate to age-old questions about free will remains a topic of active debate. The term 'enactivism' is close in meaning to 'enaction', defined as \\"the manner in which a subject of perception creatively matches its actions to the requirements of its situation\\". The introduction of the term enaction in this context is attributed to Francisco Varela, Evan Thompson, and Eleanor Rosch, who proposed the name to \\"emphasize the growing conviction that cognition is not the representation of a pre-given world by a pre-given mind but is rather the enactment of a world and a mind on the basis of a history of the variety of actions that a being in the world performs\\". This was further developed by Thompson and others, to place emphasis upon the idea that experience of the world is a result of mutual interaction between the sensorimotor capacities of the organism and its environment. The initial emphasis of enactivism upon sensorimotor skills has been criticized as \\"cognitively marginal\\", but it has been extended to apply to higher level cognitive activities, such as social interactions. \\"In the enactive view,... knowledge is constructed: it is constructed by an agent through its sensorimotor interactions with its environment, co-constructed between and within living species through their meaningful interaction with each other. In its most abstract form, knowledge is co-constructed between human individuals in socio-linguistic interactions...Science is a particular form of social knowledge construction...[that] allows us to perceive and predict events beyond our immediate cognitive grasp...and also to construct further, even more powerful scientific knowledge.\\" Enactivism is closely related to situated cognition and embodied cognition, and is presented as an alternative to cognitivism, computationalism, and Cartesian dualism. Philosophical aspects Enactivism is one of a cluster of related theories sometimes known as the 4Es. As described by Mark Rowlands, mental processes are: * Embodied involving more than the brain, including a more general involvement of bodily structures and processes. * Embedded functioning only in a related external environment. * Enacted involving not only neural processes, but also things an organism does. * Extended into the organism's environment. Enactivism proposes an alternative to dualism as a philosophy of mind, in that it emphasises the interactions between mind, body and the environment, seeing them all as inseparably intertwined in mental processes. The self arises as part of the process of an embodied entity interacting with the environment in precise ways determined by its physiology. In this sense, individuals can be seen to \\"grow into\\" or arise from their interactive role with the world. :\\"Enaction is the idea that organisms create their own experience through their actions. Organisms are not passive receivers of input from the environment, but are actors in the environment such that what they experience is shaped by how they act.\\" In The Tree of Knowledge Maturana & Varela proposed the term enactive \\"to evoke the view of knowledge that what is known is brought forth, in contraposition to the more classical views of either cognitivism or connectionism. They see enactivism as providing a middle ground between the two extremes of representationalism and solipsism. They seek to \\"confront the problem of understanding how our existence-the praxis of our living- is coupled to a surrounding world which appears filled with regularities that are at every instant the result of our biological and social histories.... to find a via media: to understand the regularity of the world we are experiencing at every moment, but without any point of reference independent of ourselves that would give certainty to our descriptions and cognitive assertions. Indeed the whole mechanism of generating ourselves, as describers and observers tells us that our world, as the world which we bring forth in our coexistence with others, will always have precisely that mixture of regularity and mutability, that combination of solidity and shifting sand, so typical of human experience when we look at it up close.\\"[Tree of Knowledge, p. 241] Enactivism also addresses the hard problem of consciousness, referred to by Thompson as part of the explanatory gap in explaining how consciousness and subjective experience are related to brain and body. \\"The problem with the dualistic concepts of consciousness and life in standard formulations of the hard problem is that they exclude each other by construction\\". Instead, according to Thompson's view of enactivism, the study of consciousness or phenomenology as exemplified by Husserl and Merleau-Ponty is to complement science and its objectification of the world. \\"The whole universe of science is built upon the world as directly experienced, and if we want to subject science itself to rigorous scrutiny and arrive at a precise assessment of its meaning and scope, we must begin by reawakening the basic experience of the world of which science is the second-order expression\\" (Merleau-Ponty, The phenomenology of perception as quoted by Thompson, p. 165). In this interpretation, enactivism asserts that science is formed or enacted as part of humankind's interactivity with its world, and by embracing phenomenology \\"science itself is properly situated in relation to the rest of human life and is thereby secured on a sounder footing.\\" Enaction has been seen as a move to conjoin representationalism with phenomenalism, that is, as adopting a constructivist epistemology, an epistemology centered upon the active participation of the subject in constructing reality. However, 'constructivism' focuses upon more than a simple 'interactivity' that could be described as a minor adjustment to 'assimilate' reality or 'accommodate' to it. Constructivism looks upon interactivity as a radical, creative, revisionist process in which the knower constructs a personal 'knowledge system' based upon their experience and tested by its viability in practical encounters with their environment. Learning is a result of perceived anomalies that produce dissatisfaction with existing conceptions. How does constructivism relate to enactivism? From the above remarks it can be seen that Glasersfeld expresses an interactivity between the knower and the known quite acceptable to an enactivist, but does not emphasize the structured probing of the environment by the knower that leads to the \\"perturbation relative to some expected result\\" that then leads to a new understanding. It is this probing activity, especially where it is not accidental but deliberate, that characterizes enaction, and invokes affect, that is, the motivation and planning that lead to doing and to fashioning the probing, both observing and modifying the environment, so that \\"perceptions and nature condition one another through generating one another.\\" The questioning nature of this probing activity is not an emphasis of Piaget and Glasersfeld. Sharing enactivism's stress upon both action and embodiment in the incorporation of knowledge, but giving Glasersfeld's mechanism of viability an evolutionary emphasis, is evolutionary epistemology. Inasmuch as an organism must reflect its environment well enough for the organism to be able to survive in it, and to be competitive enough to be able to reproduce at sustainable rate, the structure and reflexes of the organism itself embody knowledge of its environment. This biology-inspired theory of the growth of knowledge is closely tied to universal Darwinism, and is associated with evolutionary epistemologists such as Karl Popper, Donald T. Campbell, Peter Munz, and Gary Cziko. According to Munz, \\"an organism is an embodied theory about its environment... Embodied theories are also no longer expressed in language, but in anatomical structures or reflex responses, etc.\\" Psychological aspects McGann & others argue that enactivism attempts to mediate between the explanatory role of the coupling between cognitive agent and environment and the traditional emphasis on brain mechanisms found in neuroscience and psychology. In the interactive approach to social cognition developed by De Jaegher & others, the dynamics of interactive processes are seen to play significant roles in coordinating interpersonal understanding, processes that in part include what they call participatory sense-making. Recent developments of enactivism in the area of social neuroscience involve the proposal of The Interactive Brain Hypothesis where social cognition brain mechanisms, even those used in non-interactive situations, are proposed to have interactive origins. Enactive views of perception In the enactive view, perception \\"is not conceived as the transmission of information but more as an exploration of the world by various means. Cognition is not tied into the workings of an 'inner mind', some cognitive core, but occurs in directed interaction between the body and the world it inhabits.\\" Alva No√´ in advocating an enactive view of perception sought to resolve how we perceive three-dimensional objects, on the basis of two-dimensional input. He argues that we perceive this solidity (or 'volumetricity') by appealing to patterns of sensorimotor expectations. These arise from our agent-active 'movements and interaction' with objects, or 'object-active' changes in the object itself. The solidity is perceived through our expectations and skills in knowing how the object's appearance would change with changes in how we relate to it. He saw all perception as an active exploration of the world, rather than being a passive process, something which happens to us. No√´'s idea of the role of 'expectations' in three-dimensional perception has been opposed by several philosophers, notably by Andy Clark. Clark points to difficulties of the enactive approach. He points to internal processing of visual signals, for example, in the ventral and dorsal pathways, the two-streams hypothesis. This results in an integrated perception of objects (their recognition and location, respectively) yet this processing cannot be described as an action or actions. In a more general criticism, Clark suggests that perception is not a matter of expectations about sensorimotor mechanisms guiding perception. Rather, although the limitations of sensorimotor mechanisms constrain perception, this sensorimotor activity is drastically filtered to fit current needs and purposes of the organism, and it is these imposed 'expectations' that govern perception, filtering for the 'relevant' details of sensorimotor input (called \\"sensorimotor summarizing\\"). These sensorimotor-centered and purpose-centered views appear to agree on the general scheme but disagree on the dominance issue ‚Äì is the dominant component peripheral or central. Another view, the closed-loop perception one, assigns equal a-priori dominance to the peripheral and central components. In closed-loop perception, perception emerges through the process of inclusion of an item in a motor-sensory-motor loop, i.e., a loop (or loops) connecting the peripheral and central components that are relevant to that item.Ahissar, E. and E. Assa (2016) Perception as a closed-loop convergence process. eLife 5:e12830.DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12830 The item can be a body part (in which case the loops are in steady-state) or an external object (in which case the loops are perturbed and gradually converge to a steady state). These enactive loops are always active, switching dominance by the need. Another application of enaction to perception is analysis of the human hand. The many remarkably demanding uses of the hand are not learned by instruction, but through a history of engagements that lead to the acquisition of skills. According to one interpretation, it is suggested that \\"the hand [is]...an organ of cognition\\", not a faithful subordinate working under top-down instruction, but a partner in a \\"bi-directional interplay between manual and brain activity.\\" According to Daniel Hutto: \\"Enactivists are concerned to defend the view that our most elementary ways of engaging with the world and others - including our basic forms of perception and perceptual experience - are mindful in the sense of being phenomenally charged and intentionally directed, despite being non- representational and content-free.\\" Hutto calls this position 'REC' ( _R_ adical _E_ nactive _C_ ognition): \\"According to REC, there is no way to distinguish neural activity that is imagined to be genuinely content involving (and thus truly mental, truly cognitive) from other non-neural activity that merely plays a supporting or enabling role in making mind and cognition possible.\\" Participatory sense-making Hanne De Jaegher and Ezequiel Di Paolo (2007) have extended the enactive concept of sense-making into the social domain. The idea takes as its departure point the process of interaction between individuals in a social encounter. De Jaegher and Di Paolo argue that the interaction process itself can take on a form of autonomy (operationally defined). This allows them to define social cognition as the generation of meaning and its transformation through interacting individuals. The notion of participatory sense-making has led to the proposal that interaction processes can sometimes play constitutive roles in social cognition (De Jaegher, Di Paolo, Gallagher, 2010). It has been applied to research in social neuroscience and autism. '' In a similar vein, \\"an inter- enactive approach to agency holds that the behavior of agents in a social situation unfolds not only according to their individual abilities and goals, but also according to the conditions and constraints imposed by the autonomous dynamics of the interaction process itself\\". According to Torrance, enactivism involves five interlocking themes related to the question \\"What is it to be a (cognizing, conscious) agent?\\" It is: :1. to be a biologically autonomous (autopoietic) organism :2. to generate significance or meaning, rather than to act via...updated internal representations of the external world :3. to engage in sense-making via dynamic coupling with the environment :4. to 'enact' or 'bring forth' a world of significances by mutual co-determination of the organism with its enacted world :5. to arrive at an experiential awareness via lived embodiment in the world. Torrance adds that \\"many kinds of agency, in particular the agency of human beings, cannot be understood separately from understanding the nature of the interaction that occurs between agents.\\" That view introduces the social applications of enactivism. \\"Social cognition is regarded as the result of a special form of action, namely social interaction...the enactive approach looks at the circular dynamic within a dyad of embodied agents.\\" In cultural psychology, enactivism is seen as a way to uncover cultural influences upon feeling, thinking and acting. Baerveldt and Verheggen argue that \\"It appears that seemingly natural experience is thoroughly intertwined with sociocultural realities.\\" They suggest that the social patterning of experience is to be understood through enactivism, \\"the idea that the reality we have in common, and in which we find ourselves, is neither a world that exists independently from us, nor a socially shared way of representing such a pregiven world, but a world itself brought forth by our ways of communicating and our joint action....The world we inhabit is manufactured of 'meaning' rather than 'information'. Luhmann attempted to apply Maturana and Varela's notion of autopoiesis to social systems. \\"A core concept of social systems theory is derived from biological systems theory: the concept of autopoiesis. Chilean biologist Humberto Maturana come up with the concept to explain how biological systems such as cells are a product of their own production.\\" \\"Systems exist by way of operational closure and this means that they each construct themselves and their own realities.\\" Educational aspects The first definition of enaction was introduced by psychologist Jerome Bruner, who introduced enaction as 'learning by doing' in his discussion of how children learn, and how they can best be helped to learn. He associated enaction with two other ways of knowledge organization: Iconic and Symbolic.Quote from as quoted from :\\"Any domain of knowledge (or any problem within that domain of knowledge) can be represented in three ways: by a set of actions appropriate for achieving a certain result (enactive representation); by a set of summary images or graphics that stand for a concept without defining it fully (iconic representation); and by a set of symbolic or logical propositions drawn from a symbolic system that is governed by rules or laws for forming and transforming propositions (symbolic representation)\\" The term 'enactive framework' was elaborated upon by Francisco Varela and Humberto Maturana. Sriramen argues that enactivism provides \\"a rich and powerful explanatory theory for learning and being.\\" and that it is closely related to both the ideas of cognitive development of Piaget, and also the social constructivism of Vygotsky. Piaget focused on the child's immediate environment, and suggested cognitive structures like spatial perception emerge as a result of the child's interaction with the world. According to Piaget, children construct knowledge, using what they know in new ways and testing it, and the environment provides feedback concerning the adequacy of their construction. In a cultural context, Vygotsky suggested that the kind of cognition that can take place is not dictated by the engagement of the isolated child, but is also a function of social interaction and dialogue that is contingent upon a sociohistorical context. Enactivism in educational theory \\"looks at each learning situation as a complex system consisting of teacher, learner, and context, all of which frame and co-create the learning situation.\\" Enactivism in education is very closely related to situated cognition, which holds that \\"knowledge is situated, being in part a product of the activity, context, and culture in which it is developed and used.\\" This approach challenges the \\"separating of what is learned from how it is learned and used.\\" Artificial intelligence aspects The ideas of enactivism regarding how organisms engage with their environment have interested those involved in robotics and man-machine interfaces. The analogy is drawn that a robot can be designed to interact and learn from its environment in a manner similar to the way an organism does, and a human can interact with a computer- aided design tool or data base using an interface that creates an enactive environment for the user, that is, all the user's tactile, auditory, and visual capabilities are enlisted in a mutually explorative engagement, capitalizing upon all the user's abilities, and not at all limited to cerebral engagement. In these areas it is common to refer to affordances as a design concept, the idea that an environment or an interface affords opportunities for enaction, and good design involves optimizing the role of such affordances. The activity in the AI community has influenced enactivism as a whole. Referring extensively to modeling techniques for evolutionary robotics by Beer, the modeling of learning behavior by Kelso, and to modeling of sensorimotor activity by Saltzman, McGann, De Jaegher, and Di Paolo discuss how this work makes the dynamics of coupling between an agent and its environment, the foundation of enactivism, \\"an operational, empirically observable phenomenon.\\" That is, the AI environment invents examples of enactivism using concrete examples that, although not as complex as living organisms, isolate and illuminate basic principles.

It was founded in 1960, as the National Committee of Liberation (NCL), by members of South Africa's Liberal Party, which advocated for the dismantling of apartheid and gradually transforming South Africa into a free multiracial society. It was renamed \\"African Resistance Movement\\" in 1964. NLC/ARM Immediately after the 1960 Sharpeville Massacre, the apartheid government imposed a state of emergency, which allowed it to apply a broad range of sanctions against its political opponents, such as detention without trial and banning meetings, and enabled the Special Branch to secretly detain and interrogate whomever it deemed a threat to the government, without due process. After the state of emergency was lifted, the new Minister of Justice, B.J. Vorster, introduced legislation that made many parts of the emergency regulations permanent (the Sabotage Act of 1962, and the 90-day Detention Act of 1963). Much of the Liberal party's leadership was banned, detained or forced underground, rendering it impotent. A number of young Liberals became increasingly frustrated, and, in 1960, formed the National Liberation Committee (NLC). Initially focused on helping hunted people escape the country, the NLC progressed to sabotage government installations and services, explicitly eschewing violence against people. It launched its first operation in September 1963. From then, until July 1964, the NLC/ARM bombed power lines, railroad tracks and rolling stock, roads, bridges and other vulnerable infrastructure, without any civilian casualties. It aimed to turn the white population against the government by creating a situation that would result in capital flight and collapse of confidence in the country and its economy. It launched four attacks in 1961, three in 1962, eight in 1963, and ten in 1964. In May 1964, the NLC was renamed the African Resistance Movement. The name change coincided with increased internal debate about the use of violence against people, i.e. guerrilla warfare. Discovery, arrests and convictions On 4 July 1964, the security police carried out a series of raids, including one on the flat of Adrian Leftwich in Cape Town. Leftwich, a former president of the South African Union of Students, and one of the organizers of ARM, possessed a collection of documents in his possession which described virtually the entire history of the NLC, and included a notebook containing the names of and dues paid by each member. During interrogation by the security forces, Leftwich informed on his colleagues. In July, the security police arrested 29 ARM members. After brutal interrogation, several pleaded guilty. Leftwich turned state witness in the trial of five members of the Cape Town group, and in the Johannesburg trial of four members of the Johannesburg group. Of the 29 arrested, 14 were charged and 10 were convicted, receiving jail sentences of between 5 and 15 years. Railway Station Bombing On 24 July, one of the few ARM members still at large, John Harris, placed a phosphorus incendiary device in the whites-only waiting room of Johannesburg Park Station. He telephoned a bomb warning to the police, who did not respond before it exploded, killing a woman and severely burning 23 others. Harris was arrested, following a confession by one of his colleagues, John Lloyd. Harris was convicted of murder and hanged on 1 April 1965, singing \\"We Shall Overcome\\" on his way to the gallows.

Hydraulic engineering The builders of the empire planned and built impressive waterworks in their city centers, including canals, fountains, drainage systems and expansive irrigation. Inca's infrastructure and water supply system have been hailed as ‚Äúthe pinnacle of the architectural and engineering works of the Inca civilization‚Äù. Major Inca centers were chosen by experts who decided the site, its apportionment, and the basic layout of the city. In many cities we see great hydraulic engineering marvels. For example, in the city of Tipon, 3 irrigation canals diverted water from Rio Pukara to Tipon which is about 1.35 km north for Tipon's terraces. Tipon also had natural springs that they built fountains for that supplied noble residents with water for non agricultural purposes. Machu Picchu In 1450, Machu Picchu was constructed. This date was determined and based on the Carbon 14 test results. The famous lost Inca city is an architectural remnant of a society whose understanding of civil and hydraulic engineering was advanced. Today, it is famously known for its remarkable preservation as well as the beauty of the building's architecture. The site is located 120 km northwest of Cuzco in the Urubamba river valley, Peru. At 2560 m above sea level, sitting atop a mountain, the city planners had to consider the steep slopes of the site as well as the humid and rainy climate. The Inca people built this site atop a hill which was terraced (most likely for agricultural purposes). In addition to terraces, Machu Picchu is composed of two additional basic architectural elements; elite residential compounds and religious structures. The site is full of staircases and sculpted rock, which were also important to their architecture and engineering practices. An example of Machu Picchu Making models out of clay before beginning to build, the city planners remained consistent with Inca architecture and laid out a city that separated the agriculture and urban areas. Before construction began the engineers had to assess the spring and whether it could provide for all of the city‚Äôs anticipated citizens. After evaluating the water supply, the civil engineers designed a -long canal to what would become the city‚Äôs center. The canal descends the mountain slope, enters the city walls, passes through the agricultural sector, then crosses the inner wall into the urban sector, where it feeds a series of fountains. The fountains are publicly accessible and partially enclosed by walls that are typically about 1.2 m high, except for the lowest fountain, which is a private fountain for the Temple of the Condor and has higher walls. At the head of each fountain, a cut stone conduit carries the water to a rectangular spout, which is shaped to create a jet of water suitable for filling aryballos‚Äìa typical Inca clay water jug. The water collects in a stone basin in the floor of the fountain, then enters a circular drain that delivers it to the approach channel for the next fountain. The Incas built the canals on steady grades, using cut stones as the water channels. Most citizens worked on the construction and maintenance of the canal and irrigation systems, bronze and stone tools to complete the water-tight stone canals. The water then traveled through the channels into sixteen fountains known as the \\"stairway of fountains\\", reserving the first water source for the Emperor. This incredible feat supplied the population of Machu Picchu, which varied between 300 and 1000 people when the emperor was present and also helped irrigate water to the farming steppes. The fountains and canal system were built so well that they would, after a few minor repairs, still work today. To go along with the Incas' advanced water supply system, an equally impressive drainage system was built as well. Machu Picchu contains nearly 130 outlets in the center that moved the water out of the city through walls and other structures. The agriculture terraces are a feature of the complicated drainage system; the steppes helped avoid erosion and were built on a slope to aimed excess water into channels that ran alongside the stairways. These channels carried the runoff into the main drain, avoiding the main water supply. This carefully planned drainage system shows the Incas' concern and appreciation for clean water. Water engineer Ken Wright and his archaeological team found the emperor‚Äôs bathing room complete with a separate drain that carried off his used bath water so it would never re-enter Machu Picchu‚Äôs water supply.  Terraces   Terrace function and structure  The Inca faced many problems with living in areas with steep terrain. Two large issues were soil erosion and area to grow crops. The solution to these problems was the development of terraces, called Andenes. These terraces allowed the Inca to utilize the land for farming that they never could in the past. Everything about how the terrace functions, looks, its geometric alignment, etc. all depend on the slope of the land. The different layering of materials is part of what makes the terraces so successful. It starts with a base layer of large rocks, followed by a second layer of smaller rocks, then a layer of sand-like material, and finally the topsoil. You can practice this in a simulation here. The most impressive part of the terraces was their drainage systems. Drain outlets were placed in the numerous stone retaining walls. The larger rocks at the base of each terrace level are what allowed the water to flow more easily through the larger spaces in between the rocks, eventually coming out at the ‚ÄúMain Drain‚Äù. The Inca even constructed different types of drainage channels that are used for different purposes throughout the city.  How they were built and why they were effective  Studies have indicated that when terraces like the ones in the Colca Valley were being constructed, the first step was excavating into the slope, and then a subsequent infilling of the slope. A retaining wall was built to hold the fill material. This wall had many uses, including absorbing heat from the sun during the day and radiating it back out at night, often keeping crops from freezing in the chilling nighttime temperatures, and holding back the different layers of sediment. After the wall is built, the larger rocks would be placed on the bottom, then smaller rocks, then sand, then soil. Since the soil was now level, the water did not rush down the side of the mountain, which is what causes erosion. Previously, this erosion was so powerful that it had potential to wipe out major areas of the Inca road, as well as wash away all of the nutrients and fertile soil. Since the soil never washed away, nutrients would always be added from previously grown crops year after year. The Inca even grew specific crops together, to balance out the optimal amount of nutrients for all plants. For example, a planting method is known as \\"three sisters\\" incorporated the growth of corn, beans, and squash in the same terrace. This was because the fixed nitrogen in the beans helped the corn grow, while the squash acted as mulch keeping the soil moist, and also acted as a weed repellant.  Freeze- drying   Purpose  All food grown or killed by the Inca could be freeze dried. Freeze drying is still very popular today. One of the biggest benefits for freeze-drying is that it takes out all of the water and moisture but leaves all of the nutritious value. The water in meats and vegetables is what gives them a lot of their weight. This is what made it very popular for transportation purposes and storage because dried meats lasted twice as long as non-freeze-dried foods. Vegetables--potato Inca diet was largely vegetarian because large wild game was often reserved for special occasions. A very common and well known freeze-dried item was the potato, or when it was frozen, Chu√±o. Meats--llama, alpaca, duck, guinea-pig Transportation and storage of jerky Or 'charki' (the Inca name) was much easier to transport and lasted longer than not dried meats. These all had potential to be freeze- dried.  Process  Chu√±o Both meats and vegetables went through a similar freezing process. They would start by laying all the different foods on rocks and during the cold nights in high altitudes with dry air they would freeze. The next morning, a combination of the thin dry air and the heat from the sun would melt the ice and evaporate all the moisture. The most important factor about this process and what made the Inca able to do this is the dry and rarefied atmosphere that they live in. A few different methods can be used for the last step which is taken out the last of the moisture. The overarching idea is to compress the food to a point where it would expel the rest of its moisture. The process of freeze-drying was important for transportation and storage. The high elevation (low atmospheric pressure) and low temperatures of the Andes mountains is what allowed them to take advantage of this process.  Pathway systems  The vast size of the Inca empire made it essential that efficient and effective transportation systems were created and built to assist in the exchanging of goods, services, people, etc. At one point, \\"their (the Inca) empire eventually extended across western South America from Quito in the north to Santiago in the south, making it the largest empire ever seen in the Americas and the largest in the world at that time (between c. 1400 and 1533 CE).\\" It is known to have \\"extended some 3500-4000 km along the mountainous backbone of South America.\\" The trails, roads, and bridges were designed not only to link the empire physically, but these structures also helped the empire to maintain communication.  Rope bridges  An example of an Inca rope bridge Rope bridges were an integral part of the Inca road system. \\"Five centuries ago, the Andes were strung with suspension bridges. By some estimates there were as many as 200 of them.\\" As pictured to the right, these structures were used to connect two land masses, allowing for the flow of ideas, goods, people, animals, etc. across the Incan empire. \\"The Inca suspension bridges achieved clear spans of at least 150 feet, probably much greater. This was a longer span than any European masonry bridges at the time.\\" Since the Incan people did not use wheeled vehicles, most traveled by foot and/or used animals to help in the transporting of goods.  Construction  Although these bridges were assembled using twisted mountain grass, other vegetation, and saplings, they were dependable. These structures were able to both support the weight of traveling people and animals as well as withstand weather conditions over certain amounts of time. Since grass rots away over time, the bridges had to be rebuilt every year. Pictured is the weaving of grass into rope to be used in the formation of a bridge When the Inca people began building a grass suspension bridge, they would first gather natural materials of grass and other vegetation. They would then braid these elements together into rope. This contribution was made by the Inca women. Vast amounts of thin-looking rope were produced. The villagers would then deliver their quota of rope to the builders. The rope was then divided into sections. Each section consisted of an amount of thin rope being laid out together in preparation to create a thicker rope cord. Once the sections are laid out, the strands of rope made earlier are twisted together tightly and evenly, producing the larger and thicker rope cord. These larger ropes are then braided together to create cables, some as thick as a human torso. Depending on the dimensions of the cable, each could weigh up to 200 pounds. These cables were then delivered to the bridge site. It was considered bad luck for women to be anywhere near the construction of the bridge, so the Inca men were therefore in charge of the on-site construction. At the bridge site, a builder(s) would travel to the opposite landmass that they were working to connect. Once they were positioned on the opposite side, one of the thin, light-weight ropes would be thrown over to them. This rope would then be used to pull the main cables over the gorge. Stone beams were built on either side of the gorge and were used in helping to position and secure the cables. The cables were wrapped around these stone beams and tightened inch by inch to decrease any slack in the bridge. Once this was finished, the riggers carefully made their way across the hanging cables, tying the foot-ropes together and connecting the handrails and the foot-ropes with the remainder of the thin grass ropes. Not all rope bridges were exactly alike in terms of design and build. Some riggers also wove pieces of wood into the foot-ropes. Modern-day rope bridge builders in Huinchiri, Peru make offerings to Pacha Mama, otherwise known as \\"Mother Earth,\\" throughout their building process to ensure that the bridge will be strong and safe. This may have been a practice used by the Inca people since they too were religious. If all went smoothly and if tasks were performed in a timely fashion, a bridge had the potential of being constructed in three days.  Modern rope bridges  An example of a rope bridge People today continue to honor Incan traditions and expand their knowledge in the building of rope bridges. \\"Each June in Huinchiri, Peru, four Quechua communities on two sides of a gorge join together to build a bridge out of grass, creating a form of ancient infrastructure that dates back at least five centuries to the Inca Empire.\\" The previous Q‚Äôeswachaka Bridge is cut down and swept away by the Apur√≠mac River current and a new bridge is built in its place. This tradition links the Quechua communities of the Huinchiri, Chaupibanda, Choccayhua, and Ccollana Quehue to their past ancestors. > ‚ÄúAccording to our grandfathers, this bridge was built during the time of the > Inkas 600 years ago, and on it they walked their llamas and alpacas carrying > their produce.‚Äù - Eleuterio Ccallo Tapia \\"A small portion of a 60-foot replica built by Quechua weavers is on view in The Great Inka Road: Engineering an Empire at the Smithsonian‚Äôs National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, DC.\\" This exhibit will be on display at the museum through June 1, 2020. Visitors are also encouraged to experience this exhibit online. Either way, museums like the Smithsonian are working to preserve and display examples and knowledge of the Inca inspired rope bridges today. John Wilford shares in the New York Times that students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are learning much more than how objects are made. They are being taught to observe and test how archeology entwines with culture. Wilford's article was written in 2007. At this time, students involved in a course called ‚Äúmaterials in human experience,‚Äù were busy making a 60-foot-long fiber bridge in the Peruvian style. Through this project, they were introduced to the Inca people's way of thinking and building. After creating their ropes and cables, they had planned to stretch the bridge across a dry basin between two campus buildings.  Roads  This trail was originally constructed by the Inca in Peru. It is now part of the Inca trail to Machu Picchu. An example of the Inca trail from Cusco to Machu Picchu in Peru. According to author Mark Cartwright, \\"Inca roads covered over 40,000 km (25,000 miles), principally in two main highways running north to south across the Inca Empire, which eventually spread over ancient Peru, Ecuador, Chile and Bolivia.\\" Several sources challenge Cartwright's claim in stating that the Inca roads covered either more or less area then he describes. This number is difficult to solidify since some of the pathways of the Inca still may remain unaccounted for, being that they may have been washed away or covered by natural forces. \\"Inca engineers were also undaunted by geographical difficulties and built roads across ravines, rivers, deserts, and mountain passes up to 5,000 meters high.\\" Many of the constructed roads are not uniform in design. Most of the uncovered roads are about one to four meters wide. Although this is true, some roads, such as the highway in Huanuco Pampa province, can be much larger. As mentioned in the Pathway systems section, the Inca people mainly traveled on foot. Knowing this, the roads created were most likely built and paved for both humans and animals to walk and/or run along. Several roads were paved with stones or cobbles and some were \\"edged and protected with the use of small stone walls, stone markers, wooden or cane posts, or piles of stones.\\" Drainage was something that was of particular interest and importance to the Inca people. Drains and culverts were built to ensure that rainwater would effectively run off of the road's surface. The drains and culverts helped in directing the accumulating water either along or under the road.  Uses  As mentioned in the section Pathway systems, there were several uses for the Inca roads. The most obvious way in which the Inca people used the road/trail systems was to transport goods. They did this on foot and sometimes with the help of animals (llamas and alpacas). Not only were goods transported throughout the vast empire, but so were ideas and messages. The Inca needed a system of communication, so they relied on Chasquis, otherwise known as messengers. The Chasquis were chosen among the strongest and fittest young males. They ran several miles per day, only to deliver messages. These messengers resided in cabins called \\"tambos.\\" These structures were positioned along the roads and built by the Inca people. These buildings provided the Chasquis with a place to rest. These places of rest could also be used to house the Inca army in a situation of rebellion or war.  Modern Inca roads  Today, many travels to South America to hike the Inca trail. Walking and climbing the trail not only serves the purpose of allowing visitors to experience the historic pathways of the Inca people, but it allows for tourists and locals to see the Inca ruins, mountains, and exotic vegetation and animals.

Ideally a voice portal could be an access point for any type of information, services, or transactions found on the Internet. Common uses include movie time listings and stock trading. In telecommunications circles, voice portals may be referred to as interactive voice response (IVR) systems, but this term also includes DTMF services. With the emergence of conversational assistants such as Apple's Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Microsoft Cortana, and Samsung's Bixby, Voice Portals can now be accessed through mobile devices and Far Field voice smart speakers such as the Amazon Echo and Google Home. Advantages Voice portals have no dependency on the access device; even low end mobile handsets can access the service. Voice portals talk to users in their local language and there is reduced customer learning required for using voice services compared to Internet/SMS based services. A complex search query that otherwise would take multiple widgets (drop down, check box, text box filling), can easily and effortlessly be formulated by anyone who can speak without needing to be familiar with any visual interfaces. For instance, one can say, \\"Find me an eyeliner, not too thick, dark brown, from Estee Lauder MAC, that's below thirty dollars\\" or \\"What is the closest liquor store from here and what time do they close?\\" Limitations Voice is the most natural communication medium, but the information that can be provided is limited compared to visual media. For example, most Internet users try a search term, scan results, then adjust the search term to eliminate irrelevant results. They may take two or three quick iterations to get a list that they are confident will contain what they are looking for. The equivalent approach is not practical when results are spoken, as it would take far too long. In this case, a multimodal interaction would be preferable to a voice-only interface. Trends Live-agent and Internet-based voice portals are converging, and the range of information they can provide is expanding. Live-agent portals are introducing greater automation through speech recognition and text-to-speech technology, in many cases providing fully automated service, while automated Internet-based portals are adding operator fallback in premium services. The live-agent portals, which used to rely entirely on pre-structured databases holding specific types of information are expanding into more free-form Internet access, while the Internet-based portals are adding pre-structured content to improve automation of the more common types of request. Speech technology is starting to introduce Artificial Intelligence concepts that make it practical to recognise a much broader range of utterances, learning from experience. This promises to make it practical to greatly improve speaker recognition rates and expand the range of information that can be provided by a voice portal. Technology Providers A number of web-based companies are dedicated to providing voice-based access to Internet information to consumers. Quack.com launched its service in March 2000 and has since obtained the first overall voiceportal patent. Quack.com was acquired by AOL in 2000 and relaunched as AOL By Phone later that year. Tellme Networks was acquired by Microsoft in 2007. Nuance, the dominant provider of speech recognition and text-to-speech technology, is starting to deliver voice portal solutions. Other companies in this space include TelSurf Networks, FonGenie, Apptera and Call Genie. Apart from public voice portal services, a number of technology companies, including Alcatel-Lucent, Avaya, and Cisco, offer commercial enterprise-grade voice portal products to be used by companies to serve their clients. Avaya also has a carrier-grade portfolio.

Charles Powlett, 5th Duke of Bolton (c. 1718 ‚Äì 5 July 1765), styled Marquess of Winchester from 1754 to 1759, was a British soldier, nobleman and Whig politician. He was the eldest son of Harry Powlett, 4th Duke of Bolton and Catherine Parry. Educated at Winchester, he joined the British Army and became a lieutenant-colonel in 1745. Powlett was a Groom of the Bedchamber to Frederick, Prince of Wales from 1749 until the Prince's death in 1751. He had been promoted lieutenant general by 12 March 1752, when he was made a KB. Upon the succession of his father to the Dukedom in December 1754, he became known as Marquess of Winchester,George Edward Cokayne, ed. Vicary Gibbs, The Complete Peerage, vol. II, p. 214, The St Catherine Press, London, 1912 and he left his seat at Lymington to succeed his father in Hampshire. He would remain member for that county until his succession as Duke of Bolton in 1759. On 22 December 1758, he was sworn of the Privy Council. On 5 July 1765, Bolton died by suicide - shooting himself in the head with a pistol in his house in Grosvenor Square; \\"nobody knows why or wherefore,\\" wrote Horace Walpole, \\"except that there is a good deal of madness in the blood\\". Unmarried, he left most of his fortune to his illegitimate daughter, Jean Mary Browne-Powlett (c.1751‚Äì1814), who married Thomas Orde-Powlett, 1st Baron Bolton. He was succeeded in the Dukedom by his brother Harry. Grosvenor Square Lord Nassau Powlett, son of 2nd Duke of Bolton, had No 24 (formerly no 21), 1735‚Äì38, and the 3rd duke, and then his widow, had No 1, 1753‚Äì55. The 5th duke had No. 37 (formerly no 32) from 1759‚Äì65. For him it was extensively altered c. 1761‚Äì5 by John Vardy, (demolished in 1934).'In 1781 there was one water closet, hung with green flock paper and equipped with what was called a 'Mahogany Watercloset with Bason and Handles Compleat', situated on the ground floor. The library on the same floor, which had an out-of-order wind-dial over the chimneypiece, was hung with green gilt-bordered flock paper. Above, the curtains, hangings and upholstery of the two drawing-rooms were all of crimson damask, and the two Wilton carpets each covered 'the whole Floor'.' Following the 5th duke Bolton the lease holders or occupiers were the 3rd Duke of Grafton, Prime Minister, 1765; 4th Earl of Tankerville, 1769‚Äì79; Baron Alvensleben, Hanoverian Minister, c. 1780‚Äì92; 6th Duke of Bolton, 'for tenants', c. 1793‚Äì5.'Information kindly supplied by Mr. Roger White from MSS. at Hackwood: R.I.B.A. Drawings Collection, John Vardy, G4/4/1': via Survey of London: Volume 40, the Grosvenor Estate in Mayfair, Part 2 (The Buildings).

The engines were air-cooled, three-cylinder, piston-controlled inlet port two-strokes with two exhaust pipes exiting on the right side of the bike, and one on the left. It was the first production street motorcycle with capacitor discharge ignition (CDI). Right from the first triple model, the 1968 Mach III H1 500 cc, it was a sales success that gained a reputation for almost unmatched acceleration as well as an air of danger for inexperienced riders trying to cope with the bike's increased power to weight ratio over any previously available stock motorcycles. Mach III H1 500 The market for motorcycles in 1968 was changing from utilitarian transport to more aggressive sporting motorcycles that disregarded fuel economy and noise, in favor of quicker quarter mile times, which were prominently advertised by manufacturers. While Kawasaki had an inline-four four-stroke in development, it was not going be ready in time to upstage the 1969 Honda CB750, so instead they moved up the release of their conventional piston port two-stroke triple to \\"make a real splash\\". They turned to the N100 Plan, a project begun in June, 1967, whose intent was to design the most powerful production motorcycle engine in the world. They first considered increasing the bore of an existing engine but instead created an all-new engine, experimenting with both inline and L cylinder arrangements, with both two and three cylinders. They settled on an inline-three arrangement after testing showed that an inline layout did not adversely affect cooling of the middle cylinder. The result of this project was the H1 Mach III, with a 15¬∞ inclined, inline-triple engine, first produced in September, 1968, 14 months after the N100 project began. The new model did indeed sell well with young men in the late 1960s, with total production eventually exceeding 110,000 units, though it was unpopular with authorities. The bike gave Kawasaki a \\"rebel\\" image, \\"outside the law\\", which played well with sport bike riders. The racing version, the H1R ridden by Ginger Molloy, took second place in the 1970 Grand Prix World Championship. The H1 was the first multi-cylinder street motorcycle to use capacitor discharge ignition (CDI) which operated through an automotive style distributor, previously only used in off-road single cylinder motorcycles. The first version of this electronic ignition was overly complex and proved unreliable, so Kawasaki gave up on it briefly, using traditional breaker points, one set for each cylinder, in 1972. For the 1973 H1D, a redesigned CDI was used, which was more reliable with a hotter spark at lower engine speeds, which in turn made it possible to re-jet the three Mikuni carburetors for a wider power band. The US version came with a high handlebar, but a low bar was used in the European market. The bike had both detractors and enthusiastic fans, who either complained of poor handling and tendency to wheelie, or praised the power, light weight, and tendency to wheelie. For inexperienced riders the two-stroke engine's suddenly increasing power curve, with little response until a rush of power about 5,000 rpm, contributed to this unexpected liftoff of the front wheel, creating \\"fearsome reputation\\". The Mach III became known to its critics as \\"dangerous for inexperienced riders\\". The H1 had a high power-to-weight ratio for the time, and a dry weight of , comparable to a top racing motorcycle, but had generally poor handling and weak drum brakes front and rear. It could accelerate along the mile test course in 12.4 seconds. When the H1 was first announced, Motorcycle Mechanics criticised Kawasaki for their \\"own ambitious claim\\" that it was \\"the fastest and best accelerating road machine ever produced, being capable of 124 mph and 12.4 sec. for the standing start quarter mile\\".Motorcycle Mechanics, May 1969, p.25 Full Chat by John Day (staff writer) \\"John Day reviews the sporting scene\\".

Accessed August 31, 2019 with bike-retailer Reads of London at 109 and 13.5, whereas Dutch motorcycle drag racer Henk Vink, importer of Kawasakis into the Netherlands, was quoted as achieving 13.48.Kawasaki 500 triple Classic and Motorcycle Mechanics (Editor Bob Berry), EMAP, September 1991, pp.34-37. Accessed August 31, 2019 Motorcycle Classics said in 2009 that the frequent complaints about the brakes of the H1 by modern writers did not account for the generally poor braking of all motorcycles of the period, noting that in a 1970 Cycle magazine comparison of seven top bikes of the time, the H1's braking performance was second only to the Honda CB750. Cycle World's test found: \\"Repeated high speed stops did not disclose any braking difficulties. The two-leading-shoe front stopper performed the task of slowing this...very admirably, but without locking the wheel. The rear brake...would lock up the back end any time, even after several high speed stops.\\". While Kawasaki was working to \\"make the H1 acceptable in civilized society\\", they also released the delayed inline-four four-stroke, the Z1, in 1972, which had adequate brakes and handling, comfortable seating, and did not guzzle fuel. The sales success of the Z1 demonstrated that there were more buyers for higher-priced but less obnoxious sport bikes, than buyers who would accept numerous compromises for an extremely fast motorcycle at a low price. More stringent noise and pollution regulations also contributed to the end of the H1 500 production, whose final year was 1976. The Mach III H1 500 subsequently has been of great interest to collectors and historians of motorcycles, often appearing on lists of most significant motorcycles. The H1 was included in the Guggenheim Museum's 1999 The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition in New York, Chicago, Las Vegas, and Bilbao, Spain. Motorcycle historian Clement Salvadori noted in the Guggenheim's catalog that the H1, \\"was one of the least useful motorcycles available on the market\\" yet still sold very well because, in the heyday of American muscle cars where quarter mile times were paramount to the young male target buyer, it \\"could blow just about anything else off the road ‚Äî for less than $1,000.\\" Motorcycling author and journalist Roland Brown wrote that it could \\"beat almost anything away from the lights.\\" Salvadori added that \\"Motorcycle lore has it that very few original owners of the Mach III survived.\\" While older Baby boomers collected classic brands of the 1950s and 1960s like BSA, Norton and Triumph, a younger generation of motorcycle collectors was nostalgic for H1 Mach IIIs along with other bikes of the era, Honda CBs and CLs, Yamaha RD350s and Suzuki Hustlers. S1 250 and S2 350 In 1971, the S2 350 was introduced, and in 1972 its smaller brother, the S1 250 became available. H2 Mach IV 750 The H2 750 was introduced in 1972, the culmination of Kawasaki's two-stroke project. Kawasaki said of the bike, \\"It's so quick it demands the razor-sharp reactions of an experienced rider.\\" Its engine displacement of produced at 6,800 rpm. The engine was entirely new and not a bored-out 500. With larger displacement as well as less aggressive porting and ignition timing, the H2 750 had a wider power band than the 500 H1, though Brown said it was still \\"barely more practical\\" than the smaller predecessor, because Kawasaki had \\"done little\\" to address chassis problems, and so the bike was still prone to speed wobble. The gain over the 500 H1 put the H2's output well ahead of its close rivals, the air-cooled four-stroke Honda CB750 and the liquid-cooled two-stroke Suzuki GT750. To help address the speed wobble issue, the H2 came with a friction-type steering damper, as well as a built-in frame lug to attach a hydraulic steering damper. The H2 had a front disc brake, an all-new capacitor discharge ignition system which performed better than cap and rotor type, was virtually maintenance free, and was unique to the H2. The H2 also had a chain oiler, and a steering friction damper. Even with its limitations, the H2 was a success, because there were not many other bikes that could, Brown said, \\"even approach\\" the performance of the H2 Mach IV. A standard, factory produced H2 was able to travel a from a standing start in as low as 12.0 seconds with an expert rider on board.Falloon, Ian (November 2011). \\"Holy smoker\\". Motorcycle Trader (New Zealand) (211): 58‚Äì61. Cycle World recorded a quarter mile time of 12.72 seconds at , and a top speed of . Brown said it could accelerate from in under 13 seconds. The H-2 was comparison tested by Cycle magazine in 1973 against the Ducati 750, the Honda CB750, the Harley-Davidson Sportster 1000, the Kawasaki Z1, the Triumph Trident 750, and the Norton Commando 750. The competition consisted of acceleration, braking distance, and road race course lap-times. Each test was run several times including 10 attempts at a fastest road course time. The H2 was the fastest accelerating machine, posting the fastest 1/4 mile run on a drag strip. Cycles testers were surprised that despite an uncomfortable feel and slight front wheel hop under hard braking and not giving the sensation of stopping particularly fast, it had the shortest stopping distance and highest braking G load of all the bikes, winning best in class measured by stopping power from 60 mph. On the road course, despite what had been heard and written about its ill handling, frame flexing and the supposed tendency to speed wobble exiting high speed turns, the H2 was tied for the fastest lap time with the Kawasaki Z-1 to the tenth of a second. Overall the Kawasaki H-2 750 had the lowest ET, second-highest quarter-mile speed, the fastest lap time, the strongest braking force, the highest torque and horsepower readings on the dynamometer, the highest power- to-weight ratio, the lowest price and scored by points for performance was by far the least expensive per unit displacement. Brown's assessment was that the front disc brake performed adequately, though some riders added a second front disc for more braking performance. In 1975 Cycle World tested the H2 Mach IV's quarter mile at 13.06 seconds , with a 0 to 60 mph time of 4.3 seconds, 0 to 100 mph time of 13.2 seconds, and a top speed of . Kawasaki's reputation for building what motorcycle writer Alastair Walker called, \\"scarily fast, good- looking, no holds barred motorcycles\\" began with the H1. The H2 was part of the rise of the Japanese superbikes, contributing to the decline of Harley Davidson, and nearly extinguished the British motorcycle industry in the US for a long period. S3 400 In 1974, the S2 was expanded to and replaced by a S3. In addition, each model year following was met with toned down performance in attempt to meet new emissions regulations. The H and S series ceased production after 1975, and the model line became the KH series in 1976, omitting the 750 from the lineup and leaving just the KH250, KH400 and KH500. The last year for US sales was 1977, with only the KH400 and the KH250 left in the lineup. Both models continued to be available in Europe and elsewhere until 1980. Stricter emissions regulation and advances in 4-stroke technology caused the demise of the Kawasaki triples in both cases. The S1 (250cc), and later KH250 (1976-1980) models were popular for some time as a budget performance bike in the UK (Great Britain), because of their small size (although the KH shared the same chassis and gearbox as the KH400), and the fact that at this point in time it was legal for learners ride bikes up to 250cc on a \\"Provisional Licence\\" without having to take a test. This usage stopped in February 1981, however, when learners were restricted to 125cc/12bhp, and virtually overnight the sales of new 250cc machines ceased, not really taking off again until the Big Four started producing high performance 250s in the mid to late 80s in the form of the RG250 (later RGV), TZR, NSR and Kawasaki's class leading (but fragile) KR1 and KR1s. Timeline * 1968 **In addition to testing in Japan, prototype testing under the code name 'N100' included high-speed runs in the desert of the US southwest where many paved highways did not yet have speed limits. **H1 ' Mach III (September) White w/blue stripes, distributor CDI ignition, drum front brake, \\"Mach III 500\\" badge on side cover and \\"electronic ignition\\" decal on oil tank.

Late 1969 saw the introduction of the Charcoal Grey model, but a common misconception is the charcoal grey model is called a 1969 model--it is indeed a 1970 model. Kawasaki paperwork that came with the bikes, and the sales brochures confirm this. This has been spread by many in order to add value to their bikes by being able to call them a first year model when they are not.

Born in Drumcullen, County Offaly, Fleury first played competitive hurling during his schooling at Presentation Brothers College in Birr. He arrived on the inter-county scene when he first linked up with the Offaly minor team before later joining the under-21 side. He made his senior debut during the 1975 championship. Fleury later became a regular member of the starting fifteen and won two All-Ireland medals and four Leinster medals. The All-Ireland-winning captain of 1985, Fleury was an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions. As a member of the Leinster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, Fleury ended his career without a Railway Cup medal. At club level he was a one-time championship medallist in the junior grade with Drumcullen Throughout his career Fleury made 31 championship appearances. He retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 1986 championship. In retirement from playing Fleury became involved in team management and punditry. He managed the Offaly senior hurling team for one season while he is a regular contributor as a hurling analyst and co-commentator on GAA Beo. Playing career Colleges During his schooling at the Presentation College in Birr, Fleury established himself as a key member of the senior hurling team. In 1973 he won an All-Ireland colleges medal in the \\"B\\" grade. University During his studies at University College Galway, Fleury was an automatic inclusion on the college hurling team. In 1977 he was captain as UCG faced Maynooth College in the final of the inter-varsities championship. A narrow 1‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì12 victory gave Fleury a Fitzgibbon Cup medal. Club Fleury played his club hurling with Drumcullen. In 1974 he was just out of the minor grade when he won a championship medal in the junior grade. Inter-county Fleury first came to prominence on the inter-county scene for Offaly at both minor and under-21 levels, however, he had little success in either of these grades. After making some appearances in the pre-season Walsh Cup, Fleury made his senior championship debut in a 6‚Äì6 to 4‚Äì12 Leinster quarter-final draw with Kildare. He was a regular starter in the league over the next few seasons, however, it wasn't until 1977 that he established himself as a member of the championship team. In 1980 Offaly emerged from the doldrums to qualify for only their second provincial decider in fifty years. Reigning All-Ireland champions Kilkenny provided the opposition, however, a remarkable 3‚Äì17 to 5‚Äì10 victory gave Fleury his first Leinster medal. Offaly's dream season came to an end with a defeat by eventual champions Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final. Offaly proved that their success was more than a flash in the pan by reaching the provincial final again in 1981. Fleury collected his second Leinster medal that year as Offaly defeated Wexford by 3‚Äì12 to 2‚Äì13. This win allowed Offaly to advance to a very first All-Ireland final with reigning champions Galway. After fourteen minutes Pat Carroll scored the opening goal of the game for Offaly, however, neither side built up a strong lead. Straight after the interval goalkeeper Damien Martin was doing great work when he batted out an almost certain Galway goal. With just over twenty minutes left in the game Galway led by six points, however, the team failed to score for the rest of the match. Offaly, on the other hand, ate into this lead. Johnny Flaherty's controversial hand-passed goal with three minutes was the deciding score of the game. At the full-time whistle Offaly were the winners by 2‚Äì12 to 0‚Äì15. It was a first All-Ireland medal for Fleury. After suffering back-to-back Leinster final defeats to Kilkenny, Offaly triumphed once again in 1984. A 1‚Äì15 to 2‚Äì11 defeat of Wexford gave Fleury a third Leinster medal. Offaly subsequently advanced to the centenary All-Ireland final at Semple Stadium in Thurles. On the day, however, Cork were far too strong for Fleury's team. Although far from being a classic game Offaly were defeated by 3‚Äì16 to 1‚Äì12. Offaly retained their Leinster title in 1985 with Fleury adding a fourth provincial memento to this collection following a 5‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì17 trouncing of Laois. Galway provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland final and another tense game ensued. Once again it was Offaly's goal-scoring ability that proved crucial. Pat Cleary scored the first of the day after twenty-five minutes of play and got his second less than half a minute after the restart. Joe Dooley had a goal disallowed halfway through the second-half while a long Joe Cooney effort, which seemed to cross the goal line, was not given. P.J. Molloy was Galway's goal scorer, however, the day belonged to Offaly. A 2‚Äì11 to 1‚Äì12 victory gave Fleury his second All-Ireland medal while he also had the honour of collecting the Liam MacCarthy Cup as captain. In 1986 Offaly lined out in an impressive seventh Leinster decider in-a-row. Kilkenny were the opponents on that occasion, however, Offaly were now a team in decline. A 4‚Äì10 to 1‚Äì11 score line gave victory to \\"the Cats\\" and knocked Offaly out of the championship. Fleury retired from inter-county hurling following this defeat. Inter-provincial Fleury also lined out with Leinster in the inter- provincial hurling competition. He first came to prominence with his province in 1981 as Leinster took on Munster in the Railway Cup final. A ten-point defeat was Fleury's lot on that occasion. Fleury was picked on the Leinster team again in 1982. Connacht provided the opposition in the final that year and, once again, Fleury ended up on the losing side. Two years later in 1984 he was the left corner-back on the Leinster team that faced Munster in the final again. Unfortunately, Fleury's side faced a 1‚Äì18 to 2‚Äì9 defeat once again. Managerial career University College Galway Fleury first became involved in coaching during his university days in University College Galway. During his second year in the college he coached the first year team to both league and championship successes. CBS Sexton Street As a teacher at CBS Sexton Street, Fleury also took charge of various school teams. He guided the school to the Harty Cup final in 1984; however, the team faced a 4‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì7 defeat by St. Finbarr's of Cork. Success was slow in coming, however, Sexton Street reached the Harty decider again in 1993. A 5‚Äì5 to 1‚Äì12 defeat of St. Flannan's College secured the title for the first time since 1967 and for the tenth time in all. Offaly Fleury was appointed manager of the Offaly senior team on 6 October 1999. His tenure was dogged with controversy and misfortune, beginning with a threat from the Birr club players to boycott the county team after being thrown out of the club championship. A row over sponsorship erupted soon afterwards when a locally-based mobile telephone company agreed a deal with the Offaly team. On the week of their championship match against Wexford the local newspapers printed photographs of the Offaly players endorsing the new, but unofficial, sponsor. The county board were forced to issue a prompt statement underlining their unqualified commitment to Carroll Meats who were the long-time sponsors of Offaly. All of this was a distraction and Offaly faced a 2‚Äì21 to 1‚Äì13 defeat by Kilkenny in the Leinster decider. In the meantime, Fleury faced further internal strife with a number of players walking away after a lack of game time. In spite of all of this, Offaly qualified for the All-Ireland decider on 10 September 2000. As a result of the \\"back door system\\", Kilkenny were the opponents once again. D.J. Carey capitalised on an Offaly mistake after just six minutes to start a goal-fest for \\"the Cats!. Carey scored 2‚Äì4 in all, sharing his second goal with Shefflin who also scored a goal in the second-half. At the full-time whistle Kilkenny were the champions by 5‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì14. Fleury subsequently resigned as manager. Personal life Born in Drumcullen, County Offaly, Fleury was educated at the local national school before later completing his Leaving Certificate at the Presentation College in Birr. He subsequently completed a Bachelor of Arts at University College Galway, before qualifying as a secondary school teacher.

Helenalin is responsible for the toxicity of the Arnica spp. Although toxic, helenalin possesses some in vitro anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic effects. Helenalin can inhibit certain enzymes, such as 5-lipoxygenase and leukotriene C4 synthase. For this reason the compound or its derivatives may have potential medical applications.  Structure and reactivity  Helenalin belongs to the group of sesquiterpene lactones which are characterised by a lactone ring. Beside this ring, the structure of helenalin has two reactive groups (Œ±-methylene-Œ≥- butyrolactone and a cyclopentenone group) that can undergo a Michael addition. The double bond in the carbonyl group can undergo a Michael addition with a thiol group, also called a sulfhydryl group. Therefore, helenalin can interact with proteins by forming covalent bonds to the thiol groups of cysteine- containing proteins/peptides, such as glutathione. This effect can disrupt the molecule's biological function. Addition reactions can occur because thiol groups are strong nucleophiles; a thiol has a lone pair of electrons.  Chemical derivatives  There are several derivatives of helenaline known within the same sesquiterpene lactone group; pseudoguaianolides. Most of these derivatives occur naturally, such as the compound dihydrohelenalin, but there are also some semi-synthetic derivatives known, such as 2Œ≤-(S-glutathionyl)-2,3-dihydrohelenalin. In general, most derivatives are more toxic than helenalin itself. Among these, derivatives with the shortest ester groups are most likely to contain a higher toxicity. Other derivatives include 11Œ±,13-dihydrohelenalin acetate, 2,3-dehydrohelenalin and 6-O-isobutyrylhelenalin. The molecular conformation differs between helenalin and its derivatives, which affects the lipophilicity and the accessibility of the Micheal addition sites. Poorer accessibility results in a compounds with lower toxicity. Another possibility is that a derivative lacking one of the reactive groups, such as the cyclopentenone group, may have a lower toxicity.  Some biochemical effects of helenalin  Helenalin can target the p65 subunit (also called RelA) of the transcription factor NF-Œ∫B. It can react with Cys38 in RelA by Michael addition. Both reactive groups, Œ±-methylene-Œ≥- butyrolactone and cyclopentene, can react with this cysteine. It was also found that helenalin can inhibit human telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein complex, by Michael addition. In this case also, both reactive groups of helenalin can interact with the thiol group of a cysteine and inhibit the telomerase activity. Helenalin inhibits the formation of leukotrienes in human blood cells by inhibiting LTC4 synthase activity. Helenalin reacts with its cyclopentenone ring to the thiol group of the synthase.  Metabolism  Helenalin inhibits cytochrome P450 enzymes by reacting with thiol groups, resulting in inhibition of the mixed-function oxidase system. These effects are important for the cytotoxicity of helenalin. The levels of glutathione, which contains sulfhydryl groups, are reduced in helenaline-treated cells, further increasing the toxicity of helenalin. Depending on the dose of helenalin, thiol-bearing compounds such as glutathione may provide some protection to cells from helenalin toxicity. It was also seen that helenalin increase CPK and LDH activities in serum and that it inhibits multiple enzymes of the liver involved in triglyceride synthesis. Therefore, helenaline causes acute liver toxicity, accompanied by a decrease cholesterol levels. Helenalin also suppresses essential immune functions, such as those mediated by activated CD4+ T-cells, by multiple mechanisms.  In vitro anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic effects  Helenalin and some of its derivatives have been shown to have potent anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic effects in vitro. Some studies have suggested that the inhibition by helenalin of platelet leukotriene C4 synthase, telomerase activity and transcription factor NF-Œ∫B contributes to helenalin's in vitro anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic activity . The dose used varied per study. There is currently no in vivo evidence regarding helenalin's anti-inflammatory and anti-tumour effects, if any. The efficacy of helenalin for treatment of pain and swelling, when applied topically, is not supported by the current available evidence at doses of 10% or lower. For doses higher that 10%, more research is required whether those remain safe and are more efficient than the current available medications.  Application  In former times, plant extracts containing helenalin were used as a herbal medicine for the treatment sprains, blood clots, muscle strain and rheumatic complaints. Currently helenalin is used topically in homeopathic gels and microemulsions. Helenalin is not FDA- approved for medical application.\\"U.S. National Library of Medicine,\\" [Online]. Available: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=&term;=arnica+montana&cntry;=&state;=&city;=&dist;=. [Accessed 8 March 2018].  Toxicity  When applied topically on humans, helenalin can cause contact dermatitis in sensitive individuals. However, it is considered generally safe when applied this way. Oral administration of large doses of helenalin can cause gastroenteritis, muscle paralysis, and cardiac and liver damage. The toxicity of helenalin was studied in mammalian species such as mice, rat, rabbit and sheep, were the oral LD50 of helenalin was established between 85 and 150 mg/kg. It was shown in a mouse model that helenalin caused reduced levels of cholesterol. In a rat model, alcohol hepatic injury was prevented by helenalin administration. Parenteral administration showed a higher toxic effect when compared to oral administration.B. H. Rumack, \\"POISINDEX(R) Information System Micromedex, Inc.\\", CCIS, vol. 172, 2017.A. H. Hall and B. H. Rumack, \\"TOMES(R) Information System Micromedex, Inc.\\" CCIS, vol. 172, 2017 Pharmacology Helenalin has a variety of observed effects in vitro including anti-inflammatory and antitumour activities. Helenalin has been shown to selectively inhibit the transcription factor NF-Œ∫B, which plays a key role in regulating immune response, through a unique mechanism. In vitro, it is also a potent, selective inhibitor of human telomerase‚Äîwhich may partially account for its antitumor effects‚Äîhas anti-trypanosomal activity, and is toxic to Plasmodium falciparum. Animal and in vitro studies have also suggested that helenalin can reduce the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and reduce the severity of S. aureus infection.

Location  The Capital Cascade Greenway is a 6-mile (9.6 km) long greenway through downtown Tallahassee that follows the course of the St. Augustine Branch, a small creek that flows south through Cascades Park, Black Swamp, and ends in Lake Munson. The project corridor includes both public and private land.  History  The birth of the Capital Cascade Greenway came from Tallahassee's Blueprint 2000, an initiative to provide stormwater, trail and road projects that are efficient, attractive, environmentally responsible, and support the revitalization of in-town and southside neighborhoods. It is funded by an extension of the local one-cent sales tax approved by voters in November 2000. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Community Affairs have invested $7.8 million to the project. The Trust for Public Land is also a partner in the greenway's creation.  Stormwater  The greenway will address stormwater and flooding problems in southern Tallahassee where the St. Augustine Branch basin slopes steeply near downtown. Almost the whole basin is built upon which has increased the amount of impervious surfaces leaving no absorption area for rain.  Recreation  Capital Cascade Greenway will include trails for walking, and biking and link to the St. Mark's Trail, the Bow Tie Trail and the proposed Gopher, Frog and Alligator Trail (GFA.) The greenway will also have parks and playgrounds, businesses and shops and an opportunity to preserve a historic section of Florida's capital city. Parts of the corridor house the Korean War Memorial as well as historic plaques that commemorate the beginnings of Tallahassee and the State of Florida. The corridor is also very close to a number of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places as well as historic neighborhoods such as Stearns-Mosely.

William may have been a Scoto-Norman, but the two manuscripts that preserve the Roman are from northeastern France, perhaps suggesting their provenance there. It was once suggested to have been commissioned by Alan of Galloway for his wedding in 1209, since Alan was the descendant of Fergus, who ruled Galloway as king in the mid-twelfth century. Beate Schmolke-Hasselmann rejected this view and proposed that the Roman was commissioned by Dervorguilla, heiress of Galloway, and her husband, John I de Baliol, to promote the claim of their son, Hugh, to the Scottish throne, a claim derived from their ancestor Fergus Mor mac Eirc. This dates the work later than their marriage, which took place around 1223, and prior to John's death in 1268, most likely between 1237 and 1241. D. D. R. Owen, adjudging the author to be intimately familiar with major figures and events of the reign of William the Lion in Scotland, posited as \\"a strong possibility\\" that William the Clerk is William Malveisin, a Frenchman who arrived in Scotland in the 1180s and served as a royal clerk. In this scenario, the Roman was composed after 1200. Finally, William may be the William de Bois (de Bosco, de Bosch) who was a clerk of the royal chapel in 1193 and chancellor from 1210 to 1226.

The route is long and is signed east and west. The western terminus of the route is at PA 274 in Blain. The eastern terminus is at U.S. Route 11 (US 11)/US 15 in Liverpool. PA 17 is a two-lane undivided road that runs through agricultural valleys in the northern part of Perry County. The route heads northeast from Blain and intersects PA 850 in Kistler and PA 74 in Ickesburg. PA 17 crosses the Juniata River into Millerstown, where it has indirect access to the US 22/US 322 freeway. From here, the route continues east and intersects PA 235 before it comes to its terminus in Liverpool. PA 17 was designated in 1928 to run from US 22 (Market Street) in Millerstown east to US 11 in Liverpool while PA 74 was designated onto the section of road between Ickesburg and Millerstown. In the 1930s, PA 17 was extended southwest from Millerstown to PA 274 in Blain, replacing the portion of PA 74 between Ickesburg and Millerstown. Route description PA 17 begins in the borough of Blain at the intersection of PA 274, heading northwest on a two-lane undivided road. The route passes homes and turns north, crossing into Jackson Township. The road heads into open agricultural areas with a few homes, curving to the northeast. PA 17 crosses into Southwest Madison Township and runs through more farmland with some woods and residences, passing through Hench and Stony Point. The route turns east and enters Northeast Madison Township, coming to Pine Grove and curving northeast again. The road forms a brief concurrency with PA 850 in Kistler and becomes Tuscarora Path, running through more agricultural areas with occasional homes and heading more to the north. PA 17 curves northeast and heads into Saville Township, passing through more rural areas. The route curves northwest before turning northeast onto Raccoon Valley Road and heading into the residential community of Ickesburg, where it crosses PA 74. Past here, the road runs through more farmland with some woods, crossing into Tuscarora Township. In this area, PA 17 runs through wooded areas with some fields before heading into a narrow agricultural valley with a few homes. The route runs through more rural areas, passing through Donnally Mills and Gramere. The route crosses a bridge over Norfolk Southern's Pittsburgh Line and the Juniata River and then passes under US 22/US 322 as it enters the borough of Millerstown and becomes West Sunbury Street. The route passes businesses in the center of town before continuing into residential areas as East Sunbury Street, passing south of Greenwood High School. The route continues into Greenwood Township and becomes Sunbury Path, as noted by open farmland. The road crosses the Cocolamus Creek and runs through more agricultural areas with some woods and homes. PA 17 passes through more open farmland as it continues into Liverpool Township. The route, bearing the name of Pennsylvania Route 17 in this area, cuts through forested areas and later through a gap in Wildcat Ridge. Next, the route turns east through more woods and comes to a junction with PA 235. From this junction east, PA 235 runs concurrently with PA 17, as both routes continue south before entering the borough of Liverpool and terminating at US 11/US 15. History When routes were first legislated in Pennsylvania in 1911, the present alignment of PA 17 between Ickesburg and Millerstown was designated as part of Legislative Route 191 while the road between Millerstown and Liverpool was designated as Legislative Route 293. PA 17 was first designated in 1928 on its current alignment between US 22 (Market Street) in Millerstown and US 11 in Liverpool. At this time, the entire length of the route was paved. The same year, the road between Ickesburg and US 22 in Millerstown was designated as part of PA 74, which was unpaved. By 1930, PA 74 was under construction between Ickesburg and northeast of Marsh Run and between southwest of Donnally Mills and Millerstown. By this time, the road between Blain and Kistler and to the west of Ickesburg was an unnumbered unpaved road. In the 1930s, PA 17 was extended southwest from Millerstown to PA 274 in Blain along its current alignment, replacing the section of PA 74 between Ickesburg and Millerstown. At this time, the entire length of the route was paved. No major changes have occurred since then.

Also, PA 999 was extended to the southern terminus of the route in Washington Boro while US 322/US 422 were removed at the northern terminus in the 1960s. The route was realigned in the vicinity of a newly-constructed interchange with I-283 in 1969, with the original alignment severed by I-283. A new alignment of the route closer to the Susquehanna River in Columbia bypassing city streets was completed in 2015. Route description Lancaster County PA 441 northbound past US 30 in Columbia PA 441 begins at an intersection with the western terminus of PA 999 in the community of Washington Boro, located on the east bank of the Susquehanna River in Manor Township, Lancaster County. From here, the route heads north-northwest on two-lane undivided Water Street. The road runs between the Susquehanna River and Norfolk Southern's Port Road Branch to the west and homes to the east. PA 441 heads out of Washington Boro and runs northwest through wooded areas with some homes alongside the railroad tracks and the river. The route passes through a small section of West Hempfield Township before it enters the borough of Columbia, where the name becomes South Front Street. The road runs between the Port Road Branch to the southwest and Norfolk Southern's Columbia Secondary to the northeast as it heads into commercial areas and open lots. PA 441 crosses the Columbia Secondary and continues northwest along North Front Street through industrial areas. The route passes under the Columbia‚ÄìWrightsville Bridge that carries PA 462 over the Susquehanna River. PA 441 continues past industry to the east of the railroad tracks and the river before it reaches an interchange with the US 30 freeway, at which point it turns north. Past this interchange, PA 441 crosses into West Hempfield Township and becomes Chickies Hill Road, a three- lane undivided road with two northbound lanes and one southbound lane. The route runs north through forested areas and then a mix of homes and fields as it ascends a hill. The road narrows to two lanes and heads into forests as it passes to the east of Chickies Rock County Park, curving to the northwest. PA 441 crosses the Chiques Creek near the community of Chickies and becomes the border between the borough of Marietta to the southwest and East Donegal Township to the northeast. The route becomes River Road and passes through wooded areas with some homes, coming to an intersection with the western terminus of PA 23. The road fully enters East Donegal Township and curves west through residential and commercial areas with some fields, bypassing Marietta to the north. PA 441 intersects the western terminus of PA 772 and continues through a mix of farmland and development. The route comes to a junction with the southern terminus of PA 743 and leaves the Marietta area, passing through agricultural areas with some homes and commercial areas and heading to the north of a large industrial complex. The road curves southwest and reaches the residential community of Shocks Mills, where it turns northwest. PA 441 runs through farmland and crosses into Conoy Township, where it passes through a mix of farms and woods with some homes, passing to the north of a waste-to- energy plant, and curves north-northwest. The route runs through the eastern part of the residential community of Bainbridge and turns northwest into farmland to intersect the southern terminus of PA 241. The road continues northwest through a mix of fields and woods with some homes, becoming closely parallel with Norfolk Southern's Royalton Branch. PA 441 and the railroad line curve north and the route heads through the residential community of Falmouth a short distance to the east of the Susquehanna River. Dauphin County PA 441 southbound in Lower Swatara Township PA 441 crosses the Conewago Creek into Londonderry Township in Dauphin County and continues north between farmland and some woods to the east and the Norfolk Southern Royalton Branch and the Susquehanna River to the west. The route passes to the east of Three Mile Island, which is the location of the former Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station, the site of a partial nuclear meltdown in 1979. Past the former nuclear power plant, the road curves northwest and then north as it runs through wooded areas of homes with the river and railroad tracks to the west of the road. PA 441 crosses the Royalton Branch at-grade and enters the borough of Royalton, heading northwest through residential areas along Canal Street. The route becomes parallel to Amtrak's Keystone Corridor to the east and crosses the Swatara Creek into the borough of Middletown. Here, PA 441 follows Ann Street northwest before it turns north onto South Union Street, with PA 441 Truck continuing along Ann Street. The route runs past businesses and passes under Amtrak's Keystone Corridor near Middletown Station. The road heads through the commercial downtown, crossing the Middletown and Hummelstown Railroad which runs along Brown Street, before it crosses Emaus Street and continues into residential areas along North Union Street. PA 441 curves northwest and comes to an intersection with PA 230, at which point PA 441 Truck returns to the route. The route passes more homes and heads to the east of a cemetery, becoming the border between Lower Swatara Township to the west and the borough of Middletown to the east as it continues north and comes to a bridge over the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76). PA 441 curves northwest and fully enters Lower Swatara Township, where the name becomes Oberlin Road. The road passes north of Middletown Area High School and winds northwest through a mix of farm fields and woods with some homes. The route turns north and comes to a bridge over the PA 283 freeway at its interchange with the northern terminus of the Airport Connector, with PA 441 passing over PA 283 on the same bridge as the ramps connecting to the Airport Connector from PA 283. PA 441 has access to PA 283 by way of Fulling Mill Road to the north of the interchange, which heads west to a ramp to westbound PA 283 and east to North Union Street, which heads south to intersect PA 283 at a diamond interchange. PA 441 has no direct access to the Airport Connector. From here, the route heads north as a brief divided highway near the Fulling Mill Road intersection before it again becomes a two-lane undivided road and turns west into residential areas in the community of Ebenezer. The road continues west- northwest through a mix of farmland and homes before it crosses Laurel Run into Swatara Township. PA 441 becomes Lindle Road and runs through more farms and trees before continuing west into business areas as a four-lane road. The route comes to an interchange with I-283, at which point it becomes a divided highway. Past this, PA 441 turns southeast onto Eisenhower Boulevard, a three- lane road with a center left-turn lane that passes businesses. The route turns west onto two-lane undivided Highland Street and passes through fields before it comes to the residential community of Oberlin. PA 441 turns northwest onto North Harrisburg Street and heads past more homes, running through the community of Oberlin Gardens. The road passes between woods to the southwest and commercial development to the northeast and turns west, passing to the south of the Harrisburg Mall. The route curves north past more commercial development along South 28th Street before it turns west onto Sycamore Street. PA 441 continues past businesses and comes to its northern terminus at an intersection with SR 3010 (Paxton Street) to the east of the Harrisburg city line. History When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, the road between Columbia and Marietta was designated as part of Legislative Route 280, which continued north to Maytown, west to Bainbridge, and northeast to Lebanon. The road between Columbia and Marietta was paved by 1926. PA 441 was designated in 1928 to run from Washington Boro north to US 22 (Paxton Street) in Harrisburg. At this time, the route was paved between Washington Boro and Marietta, Bainbridge and Falmouth, and Royalton and Middletown, while the road to the northwest of Middletown was under construction. In the 1930s, the entire length of PA 441 was paved. Also, the northern terminus at Paxton Street was with US 322/US 422, which replaced that portion of US 22 which was realigned to the north. In 1959, PA 441 was moved to bypass Bainbridge to the east, having previously followed 2nd Street through the community. In the 1950s, the route was shifted west to a straight alignment between Columbia and Marietta instead of bending east along what is now Old Chickies Hill Road. Also, PA 999 was extended to the southern terminus of PA 441 in Washington Boro. In 1961, the route was realigned to bypass Marietta to the north instead of heading through the borough along Market Street. In 1969, PA 441 was realigned from Highland Street east of Oberlin to follow its present alignment along Oberlin Road and Eisenhower Boulevard to intersect I-283 at an interchange. The former alignment along Highland Street is now severed by I-283. Also, the US 322/US 422 designation was removed at the northern terminus in the 1960s, leaving PA 441 terminating at unnumbered Paxton Street. In July 2014, construction of a bypass for PA 441 around the community of Columbia began. PA 441 originally passed through the town on Locust Street and 3rd Street, however the road saw high levels of truck traffic, spurring interest in realigning the route away from the center of town. The bypass travels closer along the Susquehanna River, passing under PA 462, before passing over US 30 and resuming its present course. The PA 441 bypass, which cost $11.8 million, was opened to traffic on December 17, 2015. Major intersections PA 441 Truck Pennsylvania Route 441 Truck (PA 441 Truck) is a truck route of PA 441 in Middletown. The route avoids a low-overhead clearance railroad bridge and a hilly approach into the downtown along PA 441, which is complicated by parallel parking on each side of the street. PA 441 Truck heads northwest from PA 441 on two-lane undivided Ann Street, passing through residential areas. The road curves north and comes to a bridge over Amtrak's Philadelphia to Harrisburg Main Line before it comes to an intersection with PA 230. At this point, the truck route turns east to form a concurrency with PA 230 along West Main Street, a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane. The road curves northeast and passes businesses before running through residential areas, narrowing to two lanes. PA 441 Truck reaches its northern terminus upon intersecting PA 441 again.

It was while he was bishop that the diocese for the South Saxons was established at Selsey.Kirby Earliest English Kings p. 100 Daniel like Aldhelm had been educated under the Irish scholar Maildubh at Malmesbury Abbey and it was to Malmesbury that he retired in his old age when loss of sight compelled him to resign the bishopric. There, no doubt, he had also learnt the scholarship for which he was famous among his contemporaries and which made Bede turn to him as the man best able to supply information regarding the church history of the south and west of Britain. Daniel, however, is best remembered for his intimate connection with St. Boniface. It was from Daniel that the latter received commendatory letters when he started for Rome, and to Daniel he continually turned for counsel during his missionary labours in Germany. Two letters of Daniel to Boniface are preserved.Arthur West Haddan and William Stubbs, Councils, III, 304 and 343.

He seems never to have been honoured as a saint. A vision recorded in \\"Monumenta Moguntina\\", No. 112, perhaps implies that he was considered to be lacking in energy; nonetheless it would follow from William of Malmesbury's reference (Gest. Pont., I, 357) to a certain stream in which Daniel used to stand the whole night long to cool his passions, that he was a man of remarkable austerity. Daniel resigned his see in 744.

The site of two battles, the castle remains largely unchanged since its construction. It is now in the care of Historic Scotland. History Inverlochy Castle was built circa 1270‚Äì1280 by John \\"the Black\\" Comyn, Lord of Badenoch and Lochaber, and chief of the Clan Comyn. It may have been built on the site of an earlier Pictish fortification and settlement, which the historian Hector Boece (1465‚Äì1536) records as a \\"city\\" that was destroyed by Vikings. When Robert the Bruce succeeded to the Scottish throne in 1306, the Comyns, his rivals for the crown, were dispossessed, and the castle was unoccupied for a time. In 1431, clansmen of Alexander MacDonald, Lord of the Isles, defeated King James I's larger army in the first Battle of Inverlochy, fought close by the castle. It came under control of the Clan Cameron until 1501. In 1505, the partially ruined castle was granted to Alexander Gordon, 3rd Earl of Huntly, who was charged by King James IV with repairing the castle for use as a Royal garrison. His brother William Gordon, Laird of Gight, became master of Inverlochy, and was slain commanding the Camerons at Flodden. In 1645, the castle served as a stopping-off point for the royalist army of James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose during his campaign against the Covenanter forces of the Marquess of Argyll. This culminated in a victory for the royalists in the second Battle of Inverlochy, on 2 February 1645. In the 19th century, the estate was bought by James Scarlett, 1st Baron Abinger, who built a Scottish baronial style mansion to the north-west, which is now the Inverlochy Castle Hotel. Minor enhancements, including the restoration of loops and battlements, were carried out by Lord Abinger in advance of the visit of Queen Victoria in 1873. Description Inverlochy is now a ruin, but is unusual because it has remained unaltered since it was built in the reign of King Alexander III. The castle is sited on the south bank of the River Lochy, at the strategically important entrance to the Great Glen, a key passage through the Scottish Highlands. With one side defended by the river, the castle's other three sides were originally protected by a water-filled ditch. Inverlochy is a castle of enceinte, with its main defence being a substantial curtain wall. The simple layout comprises a quadrangular courtyard, across, surrounded by a wall up to thick and up to high, with round towers at each corner.MacGibbon, David and Ross, Thomas. (1887) The Castellated and Domestic Architecture of Scotland Vol. 1. Edinburgh: David Douglas The largest of these, known as the Comyn Tower, is across the interior, and served as the castle's \\"donjon\\", or keep. The smaller towers are , and all four have stairways curving up within the thickness of the walls. The main entrance was to the south, with a \\"water gate\\" facing the river to the north. Both entrances were defended by a portcullis, and the south door may have had an interior gatehouse. The ruined castle is now a scheduled monument.

Etymology and spelling Sabudana Khichadi is a popular food during fasts. The term khichdi () is derived from Sanskrit , a dish of rice and legumes. Some divergence of transliteration may be noted in the third consonant in the word khic·πõƒ´. The sound is the retroflex flap , which is written in Hindi with the Devanagari letter ‚ü®‡§°‡§º‚ü©, and in Urdu script with the Perso-Arabic letter ‚ü®⁄ë‚ü©. In Hindustani phonology, the etymological origin of the retroflex flap was when it occurred between vowels. Hence in Devanagari the letter ‚ü®‡§°‚ü©, representing , was adapted to write by adding a diacritic under it. In Urdu script, the phonological quality of the flap was represented by adapting the letter ‚ü®ÿ±‚ü©, representing , with a diacritic added above it to indicate the retroflex quality. The occurrence of this consonant in the word khic·πõƒ´ has given rise to two alternative spellings in English: khichdi, which reflects its etymology, and khichri, which reflects its phonology. History Khichuri, Bengali-style dish Korai Khichuri The Greek king Seleucus during his campaign in India (305-303 BC), mentioned that rice with pulses is very popular among people of the Indian subcontinent. The Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta mentions kishri as a dish in India composed of rice and mung beans, during his stay around 1350. Khichdi is described in the writings of Afanasiy Nikitin, a Russian adventurer who travelled to the Indian subcontinent in the 15th century. It was very popular with the Mughals, especially Jahangir. Ain-i-Akbari, a 16th-century document, written by Mughal Emperor Akbar's vizier, Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, mentions the recipe for khichdi, which gives seven variations.Recipes for Dishes Ain-i-Akbari, by Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak.

The dish is widely prepared in many Indian states, such as Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Bengal, Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, and Maharashtra. Vegetables such as cauliflower, potato, and green peas are commonly added. A popular variant in coastal Maharashtra is made with prawns. Khichdi is also a favourite comfort food, owing to the convenience of being able to cook the dish in a single simmering pot. In other regions, khichdi is commonly served with a side of kadhi, and often accompanied with papadum.

Often seasoned with ghee (clarified butter) and acar (oil-based pickle), it is accompanied with meat curries, fish, potato chops, aubergine, different types of pickles and omelettes. The rice is commonly cooked and served on rainy days. It is a staple for holy ceremonies and as an offering to gods. Cooks and homemakers often prepare this dish with many ingredients mixed with it. That is one of the reasons the idiom joga khichuri (‡¶ú‡¶ó‡¶æ ‡¶ñ‡¶ø‡¶ö‡ßÅ‡ßÅ‡¶°‡¶º‡¶ø) is used in Bangla to mean \\"a mess\\". A stickier version of the rice is traditionally served to children and sick people. It is the first solid to which babies are introduced. Rice and lentils are simmered till mushy, seasoned with turmeric and salt, and fed to infants to introduce them to \\"adult\\" food. The elderly and sick, especially those having stomach problems, are served with the rice as it is easily digestible compared to other dishes which involve more meat and spices. One popular preparation in Bangladesh is with fatty pieces of beef, where the fat of the beef is used in place of beef and chunks of beef are scattered throughout the dish. During Ramadan, Muslims in the city of Sylhet in Bangladesh, and Sylheti diaspora in countries such as the United Kingdom and United States break their fast with kisuri, and it is a notable delicacy to eat during the holy month by the Sylheti people.  Bihar  Khichdi is also very popular in Bihar. It is made with rice, dal, and garam masala, cooked into a semipaste like consistency and eaten with ghee, baigan ka bharta, aaloo ka bharta (mashed potato with onions, green chilli, salt, and mustard oil), tomato chutney (blanched tomato, onion, green chilli, grated ginger and mustard oil), pƒÅpa·πõ, tilori (a fried snack), and mango pickle. It is customarily eaten every Saturday in Bihar, and also at dinner during Makar Sankranti. A popular variation in khichdi in winter is the addition of cauliflower and green peas.  Gujarat  Khichdi is a very popular dish of Gujarat. It is served with special kadhi and addon dishes such as Surati undhia and ringan no oro. Khichdi is also served in various flavor such as Sadi Khichdi, Masala Khichdi, Swaminarayan Khichdi etc. In particular, it is a staple food (and daily diet) for most of the agrarian communities such as Patels. In Bharuch district, Gujarat, khichdi Is historically green, however in rare instances the rice and mung dal is cooked with turmeric to make it yellow, served mixed with kadhi, a thin soup made from gram flour and curd, curry leaves, cumin, and mustard seeds, and eaten as an evening meal. Khichari is the traditional diet and a daily meal of Kutchi people, and they make several varieties of dishes using khichari. Khichdi, when well cooked with a little oil, is considered a light and nutritious dish, and is especially popular amongst many who follow an ayurvedic diet or natural cure.  Haryana  Kichadi is a popular traditional staple in Haryana, specially in the rural areas. Haryanvi kichri is made from pearl millet and mung dal (split mung bean) pounded in mortar (unkhal), and often eaten by mixing with warm ghee or lassi, or even yogurt.1990, \\"Haryana District Gazetteers: Sonipat\\", Government of Haryana publication, Page 83. 1912, \\"Haryana District Gazetteers: Delhi district gazetteer\\", Government of India Gazetteers Organisation, Page 90.1987, \\"Haryana District Gazetteers: Hisar\\", Government of Haryana publication, Page 65.Charmaine O' Brien, 2013, \\"The Penguin Food Guide to India\\", Penguin Books Penguin Books. Sometimes, jowar is also mixed with bajra and mung dal.Kichri is salty and dalia is another similar sweet porridge made from the crushed wheat or barley mixed with sugar and milk.  Odisha  Khechidi is very popular in Odisha. The varieties of khechidi in Odisha include adahengu khechidi (ginger-asafoetida khichdi), moong dal khichdi, etc. Adahengu khechidi is a popular dish in the Jagannath Temple, as well. At home, moong dal khechidi and other khechidis are served with pampad, pickle, curd, aaloo bharta, or baigan bharta, raita, dalma, and chutney. In Kendujhar, a northern district of Odisha, a type of green colored khichdi is made with whole black moong which is indigenous to the Baldevjiu Temple and people of the district.  South India  Bisi bele bath, hot lentil rice, is a famous variant of khichdi from Karnataka, a state in southern India. Pongal, a dish similar to khichdi, is popular in southern India, primarily in Tamil Nadu. It is primarily made of rice and lentils, and seasoned with black pepper, cumin, and cashews.  Hyderabadi Muslims  The Hyderabadi Muslim community, of the erstwhile Hyderabad State, in present-day Telangana, Marathwada, and Hyderabad-Karnataka regions, make khichdi as a common breakfast dish, and is an important part of Hyderabadi cuisine. The dish is called khichdi, kheema, khatta, or other switch-around versions of the previous, named after the three parts of the meal,kKhichdi, ground beef, and a sour sauce, made of tamarind and sesame. The dish is commonly eaten with an omelet, as well.  Pakistan  In Pakistan, khichri () is prepared with rice and pulses or lentils and has salt as condiment. It could also have baghaar, where fried onion is added to it. Khichri is popular food for babies between 4 and 6 months when they start eating solid food, since it is soft and has no spices. People with an upset stomach also prefer khichri since it has no spices.  Fiji Islands  Khichri is a common and easy-to-prepare meal enjoyed in the Indian and also extending to growing numbers of Fijian communities. It is prepared by frying rice, lentils, masala, salt, onions, garlic, and often cubes of potatoes and ghee, and then adding water to boil it until cooked. It is consumed on its own or sometimes with pickles and chutney. The term khichri is referred to in a figure of speech common in the Indian communities \\"birbal ke khicri kab pakegi\\" (translated as \\"how long will it take to cook the khichri?\\"). This a reference to a folk tale where Birbal in a battle of wits with King Akbar, was challenged to cook khichri in a pot which was placed 20 m above the flame, so as to illustrate the amount of time it would take for someone to \\"complete a task\\". Khichra and khichdi Khichra is similar to haleem, a meat dish, while khichdi is a vegetarian dish with rice and pulses or lentils, with no spices. National dish controversy In 2017, Indian media unofficially designated it as the \\"national dish\\", as it is being globally promoted by the government of India as \\"queen of all foods\\". The report that the government may designate khichadi as India's \\"national dish\\" brought significant ridicule from the opposition politicians.Nothing cooking: Khichdi not national dish, says minister after Twitter storm, Hindustan Times. 2 November 2017. However, India's Minister of Food Processing Industries Mrs. Harsimrat Kaur Badal clarified that while Khichdi is considered nutritious and healthy food in India, the government did not have any plans to designate a national food.\\"Government to designate 'khichdi' as national dish\\", Business Standard, 1 November 2017.\\"'Fictitious' Says Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal.

Service The 6th New Jersey Infantry Regiment was recruited in the counties of Burlington, Camden, Mercer, Hudson and Hunterdon, and was mustered into Federal service in August 1861. A good part of the men who made up the unit had previous field experience in the 4th New Jersey Militia, a three-month enlistment regiment that was disbanded in July 1861 (Company F, for example, was largely made up of men who served in the 4th NJ Militia's Company K). During its field service fighting against the Confederates, it took part in a number of engagements, such as the Battle of Williamsburg, the Battle of Chancellorsville, the Battle of Gettysburg, and the Battle of the Wilderness. On September 13, 1861, the Sixth was brigaded with the 55th New York, Gardes Lafayette, the 62d New York, Anderson Zouaves and the 102nd Pennsylvania (the Old 13th Pittsburgh Washington Infantry), under the command of General John J. Peck. However, the 6th was soon removed and placed in the \\"Second New Jersey Brigade\\" along with the 5th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry, the 7th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry, and the 8th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry. Despite its beginnings as an all-New Jersey unit, regiments from other states were eventually added to the brigade, starting in 1863. It fought as part of the Army of the Potomac's III Corps until the corps was disbanded in March 1864. From that point until its muster out it was part of the II Corps. In September 1864, the original enlistments of the unit expired by law, and the men who served a full three years were mustered out of service. Men of the 6th New Jersey who had re-enlisted or were recruited after the regiment was formed were folded into the 8th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry, with whom they served for the duration of the war. Commanders Three officers served as Colonel of the regiment: *James T. Hatfield, who resigned his commission on April 27, 1862. *Gershom Mott, who was promoted to Brigadier General on September 7, 1862, *George C. Burling, who resigned March 4, 1864, and was brevetted Brigadier General, US Volunteers on March 13, 1865. While Colonel Burling was in brigade command, and after he resigned, the unit was led by Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Rose Gilkyson. Original Field & Staff officers Mustered in at the end of August/beginning of September 1861 - *Colonel James T. Hatfield *Lieutenant Colonel Simpson R. Stroud *Major John P. Van Leer *Adjutant Leonard J. Gordon *Quartermaster Joseph Woodward *Surgeon John Wiley *Assistant Surgeon Redfield Sharp *Chaplain Samuel T. Moore *Sergeant Major Charles Merriam Of the men who made up the 6th New Jersey's initial leadership, only Surgeon Wiley and Chaplain Moore would still serve in their duties when their three-year enlistments expired in September 1864. Colonel Hatfield resigned due to \\"disability\\" just prior to the 1862 Peninsular Campaign. Lieutenant Colonel Simpson Stroud died of disease in Camden, New Jersey, in November 1861, never seeing any field service. Major John P. Van Leer would be promoted to Lieutenant Colonel to replace Stroud, and was killed in action at the Battle of Williamsburg (briefly leading the regiment before his demise). Adjutant Gordon resigned in January 1862 (his replacement, Lieutenant Aaron Wilkes of Company B, was also killed at the Battle of Williamsburg). Quartermaster Woodward resigned due to disability in April 1863. Assistant Surgeon Sharp was promoted to Surgeon of the 15th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry in July 1862. While Chaplain Moore continued to serve with the 8th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry after September 1864, Surgeon Wiley chose to not re-enlist after three full years, and was honorably mustered out. Sergeant Major Merriam was promoted to 1st Lieutenant of Company H before he resigned in January 1863. Casualties According to the 1876 published work Record of Officers and Men of New Jersey in the Civil War by William S. Stryker (a Civil War veteran who was serving as New Jersey's Adjutant General at the time), a total of 1,434 men were listed as having served in the 6th New Jersey. Through its service in the field, the regiment lost 4 officers and 176 men killed, mortally wounded or died of disease, for a total of 180.William S. Stryker's Record of Officers and Men of New Jersey in the Civil War, 1861-1865 However, Dyer's Compendium puts the number at 3 Officers and 124 Enlisted men killed and mortally wounded and 1 Officer and 71 Enlisted men by disease, for a total 199. Monuments and awards A monument to the 6th New Jersey Infantry stands in the \\"Valley of Death\\" near Devil's Den in the Gettysburg National Military Park. It marks the general area where the unit fought on the second day (July 2, 1863) of the Battle of Gettysburg. In that engagement, the regiment was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Gilkyson. Sergeant Richard Conner of Company F was awarded the Medal of Honor for his bravery while rescuing the flag of his regiment during the Second Battle of Bull Run in August 1862.

Route description PA 56 starts at the intersection of Industrial Boulevard and 9th Street in New Kensington, Westmoreland County; this is also the eastern end of the C.L. Schmitt Bridge, across the Allegheny River from the PA 28 freeway. In New Kensington, PA 56 first heads south along Industrial Boulevard before turning east onto 7th Street where it first encounters a short city-maintained section of road before transitioning back to state maintenance. In the east part of New Kensington, it has a concurrency with PA 366 before entering the city of Lower Burrell. Also in Westmoreland County, it has concurrencies with PA 356 and PA 66 Alternate. After crossing the Kiskiminetas River, PA 56 merges with PA 66 for a short distance in Armstrong County. It then travels east and eventually merges with PA 156, crossing into Indiana County. At this point, it merges with US 422 and heads toward Indiana. In Indiana, US 422 and PA 56 become a short freeway. At the U.S. 119 exit, PA 56 merges with US 119, heading south. PA 56 ends its concurrency with US 119 in Homer City and continues east on a two-lane road. Approaching Armagh, it crosses US 22 at an interchange. The route then enters Westmoreland County again briefly, passing through its extreme northeastern corner. It is at this point, that PA 56 crosses through Seward. A short time after passing through Seward, it crosses into Cambria County. Continuing east, it travels along the southern side of the Conemaugh River through the Conemaugh Gap. It then emerges into the city of Johnstown. PA 56 travels through the heart of the West End section of Johnstown on two-lane city streets. It then merges with PA 403 on Broad Street, a four-lane road containing many traffic signals. At the final signal, it breaks away from PA 403 and becomes a freeway entitled Johnstown Expressway. PA 56 enters the four-lane expressway and meets US 219. It eventually exits US 219 at Scalp Avenue, the original interchange, and continues east toward Windber. The route enters Somerset County at Windber. Once past Windber, PA 56 returns to two lanes. It enters Bedford County at the top of Laurel Ridge at above sea level. The descent down the eastern slope contains a dangerous hairpin curve that has been the site of many accidents over the years. It then crosses Interstate 99 (I-99) US 220 at an interchange near Cessna. After a short distance, PA 56 crosses over I-99 and US 220, then later passes under the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76 and I-70).

A touring motorcycle is a type of motorcycle designed for touring. Although almost any motorcycle can be used for this purpose, manufacturers have developed specific models designed to address the particular needs of these riders. Touring motorcycles commonly have large displacement fairings and windshields that offer a high degree of weather and wind protection, large-capacity fuel tanks for long ranges between fill-ups, engines with a great deal of low-end horsepower, and a more relaxed, upright seating position than sport bikes. Particularly in the US, touring motorcycles may be given names such as bagger, full bagger, full dresser, full dress tourer, or dresser. These monikers (often used disparagingly or jocularly) originally applied to cruisers with full sets of saddlebags or panniers such as Harley-Davidsons; but these terms may now refer to any touring motorcycle. Full-dress tourers BMW K 1200 LT at Glacier National Park Full-dress touring motorcycles are generally characterized by extremely large fairings and ample bodywork compared to other types of tourers. Hard luggage, e.g. panniers and a top box, are integrated into the design of the motorcycle which usually has a very large displacement, torquey engine with a very upright, comfortable riding position. Additionally, optional amenities for full-dress tourers might include equipment not normally offered on other motorcycles such as complete stereos (AM/FM radios with CD players or MP3 connections), satellite radio, heated seats and hand-grips, GPS navigation systems, custom windshields, integrated air compressors, and air bags. Beyond what manufacturers supply, 'full dressers' are often customized by owners with additional accessories.The Harley-Davidson Reader. Michael Dregni, Hunter S. Thompson, Sonny Barger, Evel Knievel, Jean Davidson, Arlen Ness. MotorBooks International, 7 Feb 2010 Full-dress tourers are designed specifically for riding on pavement. A few examples of full-dress tourers are the Yamaha Royal Star Venture, the Honda Gold Wing, and Harley-Davidson Electra Glide.  Adventure tourers BMW R1200GS adventure touring motorcycleA recent type, the adventure touring motorcycle is a dual-sport motorcycle that allows long-range touring both on-road and off-road capabilities. Adventure tourers have high ground clearance (for off-road purposes), large fuel capacity, under-stressed engines for high reliability. They may have rugged GPS navigation systems, wire-spoked wheels with road-legal knobby tyres, skid plates (to protect the engine and transmission during off-road use), and tough metal panniers. Modified adventure tourers are sometimes used in gruelling rally events, such as the Dakar Rally. Adventure tourer models include the BMW R1200GS, the KTM 990 Adventure series, and Suzuki V-Strom 1000, and many others. Although most modern adventure tourers are large capacity bikes, that has not always been so: the first winner of the Dakar Rally did so on a Yamaha XT500. Sport tourers Sport tourers are a hybrid form of motorcycle between superbikes and tourers. Forming a niche market, sport tourers combine the performance of a sport bike with the long-distance capabilities and comfort of a touring motorcycle. They exhibit much greater emphasis on sporting performance (in both handling and speed) than conventional tourers. Although Honda has three sports-touring models, and BMW has four, most motorcycle manufacturers tend to have a single sport tourer, such as the Triumph Sprint ST or Yamaha FJR1300. Sports-tourers may have hard luggage as a standard fitment or as an optional extra.

It is a large gull which breeds in the Arctic regions of Canada. It is migratory, wintering from Labrador south to New England and west across the Great Lakes. The subspecies is named after the naturalist Ludwig Kumlien. It is a regular vagrant in small numbers to Britain and Ireland. It has variably been considered a full species, a subspecies of Thayer's gull, a subspecies of Iceland gull, and a hybrid between the aforementioned species, all of which are considered subspecies of the Iceland gull as of 2017. This gull was first described as a new species Larus kumlieni by William Brewster in 1883 based on a specimen obtained by Ludwig Kumlien from the Cumberland Sound during the Howgate Arctic Expedition.{{cite journalurl=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33921864 journal= Bulletin of the Nuttall Ornithological Club title=On an apparently new gull from eastern North Americapages=214-219|volume=8|issue=2year=1883}author=Brewster, William } This taxon breeds colonially or singly on coasts and cliffs, making a nest lined with grass, moss or seaweed on the ground or cliff. Normally, two or three light brown eggs are laid. The taxon is pale in all plumage, with a remarkably variable amount of pigment in the primaries. Individuals range from completely white-winged (indistinguishable from nominate L. glaucoides Iceland gull) to so dark in the wings as to be indistinguishable from Thayer's gull. Eye color is also variable, from pale yellow to dark brown. Such remarkable variation seems to lend credence to the belief that Kumlien's gull is in fact a hybrid swarm. Kumlien's gulls average smaller overall and much smaller- billed than the very large glaucous gull and are usually smaller than herring gull. The taxon reaches adult plumage in four to five years. The call is a \\"laughing\\" cry like the herring gull's, but higher pitched. A pale-extreme first cycle Kumlien's gull photographed in Toronto, Ontario: Birds with white wingtips such as this may not be separable from nominate L. glaucoides. These are omnivores like most Larus gulls, and they scavenge an seek suitable small prey. These birds forage while flying, picking up food at or just below the water's surface, and feed while walking or swimming. Their scavenging habits lead them to frequent garbage dumps, sewage outlets, and places where fish are cleaned.

History and purpose   Formation in 1922: Church aid in Europe  In the aftermath of World War I, evangelical churches in 22 European countries met to discuss how churches could aid the rebuilding of Europe. Several smaller churches in war torn countries were dependent on external help to survive, and in light of that a European church alliance was formed. DanChurchAid - at that time named ¬ªDen danske Folkekirkes N√∏dhj√¶lp til Europas Evangeliske kirker¬´ - became the Danish branch of the alliance.Fra mission til n√∏dhj√¶lp - Kristeligt Dagblad  World War II: Refugee aid  After World War II, DanChurchAid began to focus on aiding war refugees. The organisation became part of the Lutheran World Federation and the World Council of Churches, and were now able to help refugees from outside of Europe as well as within.Vores historie: Fra kirkehj√¶lp til nye globale alliancer The engagement in international refugee and disaster relief aid, led to the organisation adopting its current Danish name, , in 1953.Folkekirkens N√∏dhj√¶lp  1960 to present day: Catastrophy relief aid, humanitarian aid, and developmental aid  In the 1960s, DanChurchAid primarily worked with catastrophy relief and humanitarian aid. During the Biafra war in Nigeria, the organisation coordinated and led the Biafran airlift - a shared effort from churchly and humanitarian organisations to bring aid to children in Biafra. The airlift completed roughly 5,000 night flights. The 1970s became the decade where DanChurchAid started working with developmental aid for the first time. Since 1980, DanChurchAid has increasingly begun to focus on the political reasons behind poverty and emergency relief aid. During the Apartheid-conflict in South Africa, the organisation invited Desmond Tutu to Denmark. He encouraged the Danish government to boycot the import of coal from South Africa. That became the start of a larger political pressure, which in 1985 led then Foreign minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen to stop the import of coal from South Africa along with other goods.Folkekirkens N√∏dhj√¶lp og kampen mod Apartheid In 2010 DanChurchAid became a part of ACT Alliance - an alliance composed of over 140 churches and related humanitarian organisations, working in over 120 countries.Kirkelig n√∏dhj√¶lp g√•r sammen  Work and results  DanChurchAid works in 25 countries across the world, with regional offices in Africa, Asia and the Middle East.

Symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath and syncope, although cardiac arrest may be the first clinical presentation. Several varieties are identified, with a different potential to cause sudden cardiac death.  Anatomy and physiology of coronary arteries  Coronary arteries are vessels supplying blood and nutrients to the heart muscle (myocardium). Coronary arteries arise from ostia, openings of the aorta (the largest artery in the human body) at the upper third or middle third of the sinuses of Valsalva (the first part of the big pipe coming off the main pumping chamber). The walls of coronary arteries consist of three layers: the tunica intima or inner layer (possible site of lipid deposits and fibrosis, during life), the tunica media (a smooth muscle layer whose tone is modulated by the nervous system, influencing vessel diameter and resistance) and adventitia (where nervous endings are located). Normally, the initial portion of coronary arteries lies onto the external surface of the heart (epicardium) where fat deposits tend to form during life. In normal anatomy, three essential coronary arteries are identified: right coronary artery (RCA), left anterior descending artery (LAD) and left circumflex artery (LCx). LAD and LCx usually originate from the bifurcation of a common vessel known as left main trunk or left coronary artery (LM or LCA). Coronary arteries are identified according to the myocardial territory they feed: 1) the LAD supplies the anterior interventricular septum and anterior left ventricular free wall; 2) the LCx supplies the posterolateral left ventricular free wall; 3) the RCA supplies the right ventricular free wall; In fact, despite a certain degree of variability in coronary artery anatomy among individuals, there is greater consistency in the regions of the heart that are supplied by the different coronary arteries. The posterior descending artery, providing blood flow to the infero-posterior wall of the heart, originates from the RCA in 70-90% of individuals (‚Äúright coronary dominance‚Äù), whereas in 10-15% cases it originates from the LCx (‚Äúleft coronary dominance‚Äù). Coronary vessels diameter progressively decreases proceeding from their origin to the periphery. Besides the LM, LAD, LCx and RCA, arterial vessels that are large enough to be identified by clinical angiography are called ‚Äúbranches‚Äù, while capillaries represent the smallest peripheral vessels of the coronary tree that lack muscular tissue (and capacity to cause spasm) and are responsible for oxygen and nutrients exchange within the myocardium.  Normal variants, anomalies and epidemiological data  Regarding coronary artery anatomy, a distinction must be provided when assessing abnormalities: \\\\- normal: any morphological feature observed in >1% of an unselected population \\\\- normal variant: an alternative, unusual but benign morphological feature identified in >1% of the same population (e.g. left main is absent in 1-2% of the general population with LAD and LCx originating from separate ostia - ‚Äúabsent left trunk‚Äù variant) \\\\- coronary artery anomaly (CAA): a morphological feature seen in <1% of that population, capable of causing dysfunction The prevalence of coronary artery anomalies is inconsistent across the scientific literature, but they are considered to affect <1% of the general population. Specifically, recent data came from MRI screening of a large population (more than 5000 young children) and provided a precise estimate, suggesting that coronary artery anomalies are present in 0.45% of the US population (approximately 1.300.000 people). Classification and pathophysiology CAAs include a wide spectrum of entities with different severity. We can schematically distinguish anomalies at the ostium, such as congenital ostial atresia or stenosis or anomalous origin of a coronary artery from the opposite sinus [ACAOS] (examples: right coronary artery anomalous origin from the opposite sinus [R-ACAOS] and left coronary artery origin from the opposite sinus [R-ACAOS]); anomalies at the mid segments (such as myocardial bridge [MB]); anomalies at the termination (such as coronary arteriovenous fistulas). Anomalous origin of a coronary artery from the opposite sinus are relevant on a clinical level due to a significant association with sudden cardiac death, if they are accompanied by intramural course. Indeed, the main feature responsible for adverse outcomes is the ‚Äúintramural‚Äù course (sometimes improperly referred to as inter-arterial) characterized by an acute ostial angulation (tangential course), ‚Äúslit-like‚Äù ostium (compressed inside the aortic wall), and a proximal or initial section penetrating into the aortic tunica media (coronary arteries normally take off at a 90 degree angle) with subsequent course reaching the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù side of the heart. As a consequence, lateral compression of the coronary artery leads to coronary luminal (inside opening) narrowing, with reduced supply of blood and oxygen to the depending myocardial tissue, that is phasic (worse in systole, the phase of cardiac contraction, and tachycardia). Furthermore, the intramural segment of the ectopic artery, located inside the aorta, is typically but variably ‚Äúhypoplastic‚Äù, smaller in circumference than the distal, extramural segments (it is unable to grow properly either before or after birth). Autonomic and/or endothelial dysfunction may occur and induce spasm and/or thrombosis at anomalous sites (and critical ischemia), although intracoronary clotting has been rarely observed. Therefore, stenosis of an intramural proximal segment, lateral compression and spastic hyperreactivity are the mechanisms that have been linked to clinical manifestation. Coronary narrowing is most likely the main process implied in ACAOS, and it may result in symptoms such as chest pain (‚Äúangina pectoris‚Äù), dyspnea (shortness of breath), palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias (heart rhythm disorders), syncope (fainting). In most cases, however, coronary artery anomalies are silent for many years and the first clinical manifestation of these pathological entities is sudden cardiac death (e.g. due to malignant arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation) typically after strenuous physical exertion (when arterial compression is more severe, and cardiac work is maximal) such as in young athletes or military recruits. Of note, 19-33% (in different studies) of sudden deaths in young athletes are due to coronary artery anomalies. Clinical manifestations can be found in non- athletic, older individuals and are commonly associated with hypertension and aortic dilatation with worsening degree of compression. L-ACAOS-IM (intramural) is seen in 0.1% of young children and, among coronary anomalies, it has the highest probability of clinical repercussions, being consistently associated with sudden cardiac death following physical exercise. Several more varieties of L-ACAOS are described: \\\\- prepulmonic (L-ACAOS-PP): origin of the LCA (or only the LAD) from the right sinus of Valsalva (RSV) with an epicardial course (on the surface of the heart) anterior to the pulmonary outflow tract - this does not usually cause stenosis nor requires intervention (benign anomaly, unless spasm occurs); \\\\- subpulmonary, infundibular or intraseptal (L-ACAOS-SP): the LCA (or only the LAD) originates from the RSV, initially runs inter-arterially (outside the aortic wall) then intramyocardially inside in the ventricular septum and finally epicardially in the anterior interventricular groove - this anomaly is considered benign since it is not associated with significant fixed degree of stenosis (but it could cause spasm); \\\\- retroaortic (L-ACAOS-RA): origin of the LCA or the only LCx from the RSV or from the RCA, running behind the aortic root and at the central fibrous mitro-aortic septum ‚Äì this is considered as a benign anomaly (but it could cause spasm); \\\\- retrocardiac (L-ACAOS-RC) ‚Äì LCA originates from the RCA at the atrioventricular groove - or wrap-around the apex (L-ACAOS-WA) ‚Äì generally benign, unless spasm occurs. General scheme to identify possible courses of normal and ectopic coronary origin. AA = antero-left; AR = antero- right; Cx = circumfles artery; IM = intramural; IS = intraseptal; LAD = left anterior descending artery; M = mitral valve; P = posterior; PP = prepulmonic; RA = retroaortic; RC = retrocardiac; RCA = right coronary artery; T = tricuspid valve. R-ACAOS-IM is observed in a higher percentage of cases (0.35% of adolescents) than L-ACAOS-IM but is less likely to be associated with sudden cardiac death in athletes. Varieties of R-ACAOS such as prepulmonic, retroaortic and intraseptal can occur and are considered generally benign. The most frequent symptomatic coronary anomaly in infants and young children is anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery, which may cause acute myocardial infarction at neonatal age and requires emergent surgery at the time of diagnosis.Angelini P, ed. Coronary Artery Anomalies: A Comprehensive Approach. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; 1999:27-150. Anomalies at the mid segments include myocardial bridges, affecting >1% of the clinical population, and characterized by an intramyocardial course of coronary arteries within the muscle fibers. This may lead to systolic compression which is usually mild (coronary blood flow is mostly diastolic). Significant ischemia is rare in isolated myocardial bridges, and if present this is generally due to localized endothelial dysfunction with a tendency to spasm. Most myocardial bridges are benign and do not require any intervention. Coronary artery aneurysms are defined as a > 50% increase of the vessel diameter. Some cases are congenital/idiopathic, but most are secondary to atherosclerosis or Kawasaki disease (an immuno- inflammatory disease especially targeting coronary vessels wall). Potential complications include localized thrombosis, distal embolization, rupture, or late lipid deposits. Coronary arteriovenous fistulas are anomalies at the termination consisting of an anomalous connection of coronary arteries to coronary veins, veins of the pulmonary or systemic circulations, or to any cardiac cavity. Smaller fistulas are usually benign, and only severe cases can be complicated by aneurysmatic dilatation with potential thrombosis and distal embolization, volume overload or ‚Äúblood steal‚Äù from arterial circulation and subsequent ischemia. Treatment is generally not required.  Diagnosis, screening and treatment  There is not enough clarity and consistency among experts in regard to the subject of coronary artery anomalies, their classification, severity and management. Precise, unequivocal recommendations are still lacking and further investigation is required to properly assess the risk associated with such anomalies and offer treatment based on individual severity. Nonetheless, given their often ‚Äúsilent‚Äù nature, effective screening of the population in search of these entities is necessary in order to prevent complications such as sudden cardiac death, especially in athletes and young individuals engaging in strenuous physical activity. Coronary artery anomalies cannot be identified solely on the basis of EKG and clinical history: carriers are often asymptomatic before cardiac arrest may occur, and when symptoms are present, they are nonspecific, especially in young individuals. Diagnosis of such entities is often made incidentally in patients undergoing imaging tests during routine screening. There is an open debate about the cost/efficiency of generalized diagnostic screening in large populations. Carriers of coronary artery anomalies may receive positive results following stress/imaging tests. However, only in a minority of cases ischemia in the context of coronary artery anomalies is reproducible by stress or imaging testing and is mainly associated with particular conditions such as intense (maximal) exercise, which may lead to confusing results and misdiagnosis by techniques such as treadmill test or nuclear testing. Nonetheless, routine screening of high-risk populations (e.g. individuals participating in competitive sports) should be generally encouraged in clinical practice of sports cardiologists.

Black arrow = compressed intramural RCA. Intravascular ultrasound imaging of intramural RCA during systole (left) and diastole (right) in a patient with mild symptoms. Various imaging tests have a potential to identify coronary artery anomalies. Echocardiography (ultrasound scanning of the heart) is simple, non-invasive and economical. Its use for CAAs screening is limited because its diagnostic sensitivity is highly dependent on the operator's skills and is significantly lower in larger individuals (>40 kg). The diagnostic power of echocardiography is generally poor in most cases after infancy. Especially if clinical suspicion for CAAs is high (e.g. syncope following exertion and/or history of aborted sudden cardiac death). Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is an excellent tool to identify coronary artery anomalies with a significantly higher diagnostic accuracy than standard echocardiography. Compared to CMR, coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) provides more precise assessment of coronary anatomy, course and degree of stenosis, but its clinical use for screening is strongly limited by its cost, the need for ionizing radiation, intravenous contrast and, in many cases, drugs administration. Assessment of severity of stenosis is best achieved by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging and it should be considered in known carriers of ACAOS-IM or that have symptoms or positive stress test results or are involved in competitive exercises. IVUS consists of cross-sectional imaging of coronary arteries in a catheterization laboratory by advancing a thin probe inside the vascular lumen, obtaining precise in-vivo information about degree of area stenosis in different arterial segments, providing a solid basis for treatment strategies. Criteria for intervention in ACAOS-IM are: \\\\- symptoms of effort-related chest pain, shortness of breath, syncope or aborted sudden cardiac death (Class I, Level of Evidence A/B) and/or high-risk professional lifestyle. \\\\- positive treadmill stress test, ideally by nuclear technology, in the correct dependent myocardial territory, in the presence of intramural course (Class I, Level of Evidence B) For special populations, e.g. athletes, treatment may be indicated with specific advice of medical experts, in the absence of the previously mentioned criteria. Cut-off for stenosis severity requiring intervention is not clear, although narrowing >50% in comparison to the distal normal segment is generally accepted as a marker of severity in L-ACAOS-IM. Decisions on treatment should be guided by the patient's individual characteristics such as age, symptoms, profession and level of engagement in physical activity. Pharmacological treatment and observation may be appropriate in selected, low- risk patients. Importantly, untreated carriers of significant ACAOS should not generally engage in competitive sports or strenuous activities. Treatment options for ACAOS-IM include both catheter-based procedures (percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]) and surgical interventions. PCI consists of stent angioplasty of the proximal, intramural segment by placing a thin metal tube (a stent) in order to keep open the narrowed artery. PCI of R-ACAOS-IM is feasible and quite successful, but further experience is needed in L-ACAOS-IM since few cases have been treated percutaneously, while surgery is the recommended treatment in this subpopulation, at this time. Surgery consists of ‚Äúunroofing‚Äù or denudation of the intramural coronary segment from the aortic wall: this approach is currently the gold standard. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and reimplantation of the ectopic artery are obsolete and not indicated, because of competitive flow in mild resting narrowings.

The bank's Pennsylvania headquarters is located in downtown Pittsburgh, Ohio headquarters is located in downtown Cleveland, and Virginia headquarters is located in Hampton Roads.  History   Founding  Charles A. Colton (1807-1881), a Hartford, Connecticut native, moved to Pittsburgh with his family in 1850 to sell insurance. Mills, factories, coal mines and other industries in the fast-growing Pittsburgh region were drawing thousands of people annually, Americans and immigrants alike, in search of work. Colton recognized the need for a mutual bank to serve the interests of the working class. On July 19, 1855, Dollar Bank opened for business as \\"The Pittsburgh Dollar Savings Institution\\".dollar.bank: About / Historical Timeline For $1, anyone could open a savings account. The first day's deposits totaled $53, which included two dollars from Charles Colton's 10-year-old son. Colton was the only salaried employee for the first three-and-a-half years of the institution's existence. In 1858, \\"The Pittsburgh Dollar Savings Institution\\". changed its name to Dollar Savings Bank. A survey by The Daily Post in November 1880 revealed that the trade of iron worker was the most common occupation among depositors who opened accounts that year. Artisans (stonemasons, plasterers, millwrights and other skilled trades) were the second most common by occupation, followed by porters, waiters, clerks, salesmen, bookkeepers, farmers and coal miners. Women comprised 45% of Dollar Bank's savings account holders. At the time of Colton's death in 1881, Dollar Savings Bank had more depositors and more money on deposit ($6.5 million) than any of the other 17 banks in the city. Colton had personally handled the opening of more than 10,000 savings accounts of the 65,000+ accounts in total that Dollar Savings Bank had recorded in its ledgers over the first 26 years.  Mutual Bank Structure  Dollar Bank is one of the few U.S. banks that has a mutual structure: It is owned by its depositor base customers, not by outside shareholders. Mutual savings banks in the United States date back to 1816. Originally these institutions were organized to help the working classes because most commercial bankers at the time primarily served retail and commercial business. With no public shareholders to answer to, the bank is not fixated on stock price but on customer service. Such a structure lends itself to a more conservative business model so that the bank never participated, for instance, in the subprime lending that was so destructive to other banks during the 2008 financial crisis. Though rare in the banking industry, mutual structures are common in the insurance world and even in the investment world. The Vanguard Group of mutual funds is probably the most famous mutually- structured financial institution. On December 3, 2018, the bank completed its reorganization from a mutual savings bank to a mutual holding company. A mutual holding company results from the conversion of a mutual institution into a parent company of a subsidiary stock company. As a result of the conversion‚Äîreferred to as mutual-to-stock conversion‚Äîthe parent company owns a portion of the subsidiary stock company, and the subsidiary receives all of the assets and liabilities of the original mutual company. For owners of the original mutual company‚Äîmembers who before the conversion retained ownership and sometimes governance of the mutual‚Äîit means the termination of the prior- held mutual rights in exchange for the option to ownership in stock form. As part of the conversion, the mutual holding company may undergo an initial public offering (IPO) where members of the original mutual company are given an opportunity to purchase shares of the new mutual holding company, but Dollar Bank CEO Jim McQuade says that this is not Dollar's intention. From this point forward, Dollar Bank operates under a mutual holding company structure with Dollar Mutual Bancorp (a mutual entity without shareholders) owning 100% of the common stock of Dollar Bank, Federal Savings Bank.  African American Customers  From Dollar Bank's founding in July 1855, the bank made no restrictions on who could open a savings account. African Americans were among its earliest customers. First Savings Account Born in Richmond, Virginia in 1812, Alfred A. Gibson became Dollar Bank's first African American depositor when he opened his savings account on November 13, 1855. He listed his occupation as a porter on a boat. In 1860, Gibson opened a second savings account at Dollar Bank. By that time, he was a porter at the Monongahela House, one of the most celebrated hotels in Pittsburgh. He was one of thirty founding members of the Colored United Brethren of Mutual Relief, a mutual aid society founded in 1843 in the Hill District. His wife, Maria Gibson, and son Alfred A. Gibson, Jr., also had savings accounts with Dollar Bank. First Mortgage Dollar Bank's first mortgage to an African American was issued in February 1860 to John L. Woodson, a barber. oldest son of Lewis and Caroline Woodson. John L. Woodson paid off his $850 mortgage in 1863. He and his wife, Julia Brannon Woodson, raised their three children in their home on Pittsburgh's South Side. Civil War Growth Nearly 200,000 African American men fought in the Civil War. Soldiers such as Clayton Ragan, Vachel Catlin, William Temple and William Chatman became early customers of Dollar Bank . Slaves in the battle-torn Virginia region took liberation into their own hands by fleeing towards the lines of Union troops and Northern states. The migration swelled the African American population in cities like Pittsburgh, which was already growing with industrial expansion and workers seeking jobs. Between 1855 and the early 1900s, about 40% of Dollar Bank's African American customers were born in Virginia.  Famous Notable Customers  Founders of iconic Pittsburgh department stores were among Dollar Bank's depositors in the late 1800s. Joseph Horne opened a savings account in 1862 in trust for his son, Durbin. Brothers Morris and Jacob Kaufmann, German immigrants who were making a name in Pittsburgh retail, became depositors in 1888 and 1890, respectively. Walter Rosenbaum, whose father Max founded The Rosenbaum Company store, which for decades anchored a corner of the intersection at Market Street and Liberty Avenue, opened an account with Dollar Bank in 1894. Artist George Hetzel, founder of the Scalp Level School of painting, is famous for his landscapes showcasing the natural beauty of Southwestern Pennsylvania. In February 1866, he opened a savings account at Dollar Bank. Author, publisher, abolitionist and women's rights advocate Jane Grey Swisshelm opened a savings account at Dollar Bank in 1876. The Pittsburgh neighborhood of Swisshelm Park is named in her honor. In March 1888, John Paul Golden, M.D., became the first African American graduate with a medical degree from Western Pennsylvania Medical College, forerunner of University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. One month later, Dr. Golden became a Dollar Bank depositor. Composer and conductor Victor Herbert made his home in Pittsburgh for six years, 1898 through 1904, when he was conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony. His home in Shadyside became a gathering place for world-famous musical talent. Herbert opened a savings account at Dollar Bank in 1900. Abolitionist, preacher, and Underground Railroad activist Lewis Woodson and his wife Caroline Woodson became Dollar Bank depositors in 1857 and 1860. They were the patriarch and matriarch of one of the notable African American families in early Pittsburgh. At least twelve Woodson family members opened savings accounts at Dollar Bank by the early 1900s.  First Office  The Dollar Savings Bank's Fourth Avenue Building was opened in April 1871 and is still in operation today. The architect was Isaac H. Hobbs & Sons of Philadelphia. The building was constructed using 14,000 tons of brownstone, quarried in Portland, Connecticut. When the Hobbs building was constructed, two stone lions were carved on site beside the stairs leading to the entrance of the Fourth Avenue Building, as symbols of guardianship of the people's money. The stately lions guarding the entrance were sculpted by 28-year-old German immigrant Max Kohler, and his 25-year-old assistant, Welsh immigrant Richard C. Morgan. Each lion was carved from a single block of quarry-bedded brownstone. A project to restore the original Kohler lions began in September 2009. A new pair of lions, exact replicas of the originals, were created by Master Carver Nicholas Fairplay and his assistant, Brian C.E. Baker. The original lions were returned to the Fourth Avenue building in February 2012 and placed inside the main banking hall, while the new lions were installed on the plinths outside in May 2013. The Board Room was added to The Dollar Savings Bank's Fourth Avenue Building in 1896 at a cost of $37,981. Today, the Dollar Bank Heritage Center in the Fourth Avenue Building contains displays of vintage banking machines, Dollar Bank advertising through the decades, oil portraits and photographs of the Bank's officers and Trustees, and hand-written ledgers featuring the original signatures of some of the Dollar Bank's early depositors.Dollar Bank: Dollar Bank Heritage Center.

Lighting fixtures were replaced with a new brass chandelier and sconces which remain in place today. The extensive security cage over the teller counter was reduced by removing a substantial portion of the wrought iron. Pittsburgh was not immune to the bank failures that plagued the nation during the Great Depression. Pittsburgh-based financial institutions that closed in 1931 and 1932 included Exchange National Bank, Monongahela National Bank, Diamond National Bank and Duquesne National Bank. Perhaps the most shocking failure was that of Bank of Pittsburgh, N.A., which closed its doors in September 1931. Dollar Savings Bank, however, grew deposits from $44 million in 1930 to $56 million in 1940. After the St. Patrick's Day Flood of 1936, Dollar Savings Bank hired local contractor W.F. Trimble & Sons to install a new vault that was both fireproof and flood-proof. Designed by Philadelphia-based vault engineers The Hollar Company, the vault was installed in November 1937. World War II and 1950s Dollar Savings Bank applied for FDIC membership in November 1943. By June 1950, Dollar Savings Bank had more than 63,000 depositors and assets of $101.6 million, the first time in the bank's history that assets exceeded $100 million. Dollar Savings Bank celebrated its 100th anniversary in July 1955.

Dollar Savings Bank bought the six-story Boyd Building at 303-309 Smithfield Street in February 1950. The bank built a new, additional entrance on Smithfield and used the second floor for offices. The rest of the building was leased to the Pittsburgh chapter of the American Red Cross. In 1956, Dollar Savings Bank purchased the DeRoy Building and converted the first floor for bank use, expanding the Fourth Avenue Building footprint. This building was demolished in 1970 and the space became a pedestrian plaza. In the 1960s, Fourth Avenue Building's cupola skylights were filled in, the interior was repainted and the teller counter was altered to make it one level surface. Dollar Savings Bank opened its first branch office on June 29, 1961, in the Oliver Building. The Squirrel Hill branch office was opened in 1963; it was Dollar Bank's first location outside of downtown. Over the next 15 years, Dollar Bank expanded to 21 locations in four counties.

Capable of processing 12,000 savings transactions an hour, the NCR 315 transmitted data in real time over leased phone lines. Dollar Savings Bank customers could complete any normal transaction at any window, in any Dollar Savings Bank office, instead of being tied to a particular location for their bank business. Dollar Savings Bank was the first bank in Pennsylvania and among the first ten in the nation to use an online teller accounting system. On April 1, 1975, Dollar Savings Bank launched Pay-By-Phone, a fully automated bill payment service for savings account customers. The system was the first of its kind in Pennsylvania and second in the United States. Dollar Savings Bank's Fourth Avenue Office was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 14, 1976. In December 1976, Dollar Savings Bank announced that its assets had reached $1 billion, representing a 17.9 percent growth over just one year before. This was the largest single year of growth in the history of the bank. The bank's net earnings increased more than 200 percent in the previous fiscal year. Dollar Savings Bank installed its first automated teller machine (ATM) in 1977 and in 1978 free retail checking accounts, called \\"NOW accounts\\", were offered for the first time. In July 1981, Dollar Savings Bank began to offer accounts and services tailored to the needs of businesses.  Market expansion  On September 20, 1984, The Dollar Savings Bank acquired Continental Federal Savings and Loan Bank and offered banking services to the Cleveland, Ohio, area. In a deal brokered by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, The Dollar Savings Bank acquired the troubled Cleveland-based thrift and within two years, a combination of government guarantees against losses and new investment returned Continental to profitability. That same year, Continental's name was changed to Dollar Bank and The Dollar Savings Bank was renamed to \\"Dollar Bank\\". Dollar Bank began offering term loans, lines of credit and Credit cards in 1986. The first Dollar Bank Loan Center was opened in Murrysville, Pennsylvania, on January 18, 1994.

Dollar Bank became the 16th bank in the country to offer online banking via the Internet in March 1997. Dollar Bank initiates the Freedom ATM Alliance surcharge free network, a group of 29 banks that joined together on January 4, 1999. The goal of the Alliance is to provide surcharge- free ATM alternatives to customers. Banks entering the Alliance agree not to surcharge the customers of any other Alliance member at their ATMs.  National recognition  On April 6, 1998, the Dollar Bank online banking service was inducted into the 1998 Computerworld Smithsonian Innovation Collection.  Product development  In January 2005, the Dollar Bank CD Ladder was launched as the first CD of its kind. Laddering is based upon the premise of not putting all money in a single CD. By dividing money between CD terms ranging from short to long, CDs with a range of yields that reflect market expectations for the future direction of interest rates are purchased. Dollar Bank was the first to offer text messaging on June 19, 2007, and mobile online banking was introduced on June 5, 2008. On March 11, 2009, Dollar Bank introduced reverse mortgages to provide financial help to seniors.  Recent developments  right right In July 2012, Dollar Bank was the first financial institution in the region to release video personal teller machines. This allows customers to speak to a live teller during non-traditional banking hours. Dollar Bank opened a new Ohio headquarters at The Galleria at Erieview in Cleveland, Ohio, on July 28, 2008.

Montfort's Autopia, which assembles short sentences from the names of automobiles, is another project that also appears as a printed book (published by Troll Thread), a gallery installation, and a web page. These and other of his computer-generated books have been considered conceptual writing. Several of Montfort's printed computer-generated books were generated with programs he wrote during National Novel Generation Month (NaNoGenMo). These include three self-published books, Hard West Turn (2018 Edition), Megawatt, and World Clock, written during the first NaNoGenMo in 2014. Translations of two of these were published by presses in Europe: World Clock was published in Polish translation by ha!art, and Megawatt in German translation by Frohmann. Montfort is the founder and series editor of Using Electricity, a series of computer-generated books published by Counterpath. In November 2019 Montfort announced \\"Nano-NaNoGenMo,\\" calling for short computer programs within that year's National Novel Generation Month. His request was that people write programs of 256 characters or less to generate novels of 50,000 words or more. He contributed several such programs himself, as did several others.  Poetry  Montfort's poetry, in addition to computer- generated books and projects, includes digital poems that are collaborations with others. He, Amaranth Borsuk and Jesper Juul wrote The Deletionist, a system for generating erasure poetry from any page on the web. With Stephanie Strickland he wrote Sea and Spar Between, a generator of about 225 trillion stanzas arranged in a grid and combining language from Herman Melville Moby Dick and Emily Dickison's poems. Montfort and William Gillespie wrote 2002: A Palindrome Story, a 2002-word narrative palindrome published in 2002 in print and on the web.

Chief staples of Maya economic activities were centered primarily around foods like fish, squash, yams, corn, honey, beans, turkey, vegetables, chocolate drinks; raw materials such as limestone, marble, jade, wood, copper and gold; and manufactured goods such as paper, books, furniture, jewelry, clothing, carvings, toys, weapons, and luxury goods. The Maya also had an important service sector, through which mathematicians, farming consultants, artisans, architects, astronomers, scribes and artists would sell their services. Specialized craftsmen also played a large part, creating luxury items and developing devices to overcome specific problems usually by royal decree. They also engaged in long range trade of almost any other necessities such as salt, potato, stone and luxury items because there was a large need for trade in order to bring such basic goods together. The types of trade varied greatly regionally with specific districts of kingdoms typically specializing in a specific trade which contained workers of every skill set needed to produce their designated specialty. Areas were typically given a designated specialty based upon the resources available in their areas which allowed for very rapid production and distribution of a regions products. Structure The Maya relied on a strong middle class of skilled and semi-skilled workers and artisans which produced both commodities and specialized goods. Governing this middle class was smaller class of specially educated merchant governors who would direct regional economies based upon simple supply and demand analysis who would place mass orders as needed by other regions. Above the merchants were highly skilled specialists such as artists, mathematicians, architects, advisers, astronomers. The specialist class would sell their services and create luxury goods based upon their specific skill set. At the top of the structure was a ruler, or rulers, and an array of advisers who would manage trade with other kingdoms, ensure that regions remained stable, inject capital into specific sectors and authorize construction of large public works. For decades, Maya exchange systems and overall economic systems have been viewed as overly simplistic and adhering to ideas of preindustrial political economies put forth by Polanyi. (Feinman and Garraty 2010:169; Hirth 1996:204) In the mid-20th century, political economy was examined with an emphasis on identifying the evolution of political organization rather than understanding the economic systems that set the foundation for how they function.(Hirth 1996:203) Polanyi put forth three modes of exchange for the Maya: reciprocity, redistribution, and market exchange, which limited Maya societies to chiefdom levels of societal complexity. (Dahlin 2009:342) In Polanyi's model of Maya economy there existed highly centralized control of exchange by the elite members of society who maintained their status and a system of civic- ceremonial infrastructure through taxation of tribute goods followed by redistribution down the social ladder to secure loyalty and fealty from others. (Dahlin 2009:342) Polanyi's legacy and the subsequent substantivist versus formalist debate have reduced interest in the discussion of preindustrial market economies and have created a market/no market dichotomy in political economy literature. (Feinman and Garraty 2010:169) However, as more research has been conducted on Maya trade and exchange systems there have been multiple models put forth that recognize higher levels of complexity, various degrees of participation, and fluctuating economic scales related to political organization and collapse. (Rathje and Sabloff 1973; Hirth 1996; Feinman and Garraty 2010; Braswell 2010) The delineation of trade routes, and acceptance of marketplaces and market exchange economies, has increased due in large part to the archaeological research surrounding Maya obsidian procurement, distribution, production, and exchange. (Asaro et al. 1978; Golitko and Feinman 2015; Shaw 2012; Coronel 2011) It is now believed that Classic Maya cities were highly integrated and urbanized, featuring marketplaces and market economies to exchange many goods including obsidian. A market exchange mechanism has been noted at Classic period Calakmul murals that depict a range of specialists near an area that appears to be a market. (Feinman and Garraty 2010) Linguistic evidence shows that there are words in the Yucatec Maya language for ‚Äúmarket‚Äù and ‚Äúwhere one buys and sells‚Äù. (Coronel et al. 2015) The Classic Maya region is highly integrated into the overall trade network but it appears that several routes connected the East and West due to the variety of large, urbanized Maya centers as well as marketplace distribution economies. (Golitko and Feinman 2015) At Late Classic Coba, marketplaces were determined to have existed in two large plazas that featured multiple causeway entrances, linear/parallel market stall architecture, and geochemical signatures of high Phosphorus levels in arranged patterns which indicate the presence of traded organic goods. (Coronel et al. 2015) In the Puuc region, more central Mexican obsidian entered and while it does appear to be limited to elites only it does appear to be a highly commercialized and valued exchange good linked to Chichen Itz√° and market distribution. (Braswell et al. 2011) Currency The Maya used several different mediums of exchange and in the trading of food commodities, the barter system was typically used for large orders. Cacao beans were used for everyday exchange in Postclassic times. For more expensive purchases gold, jade and copper were used as a means of exchange.ahttp://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/exhibits/aztec/maya_commercial.html However, these mediums of exchange are not \\"money\\" in the modern sense, in different sites and cities, these mediums of exchange were valued differently. Development Because of the readily available trade resources and local merchants in most of the Maya territory, small towns did not need to take part in long-distance trading and limited trade to local exchange. Despite the fact that the area was rich in resources, even the most self-sufficient farm families, which were the vast majority of the population, still had to participate in exchanges in order to obtain the necessities (the necessities would generally include some pottery, bronze or copper tools, salt, and imported fish for inland areas). As craftsmen in small cities began to specialize and the cities began to grow, so did the need for increased trade. Cities such as Tikal and El Mirador are two such examples. Tikal, specifically, had a population somewhere in the range of 60,000‚Äì120,000 people, which means it would have needed to get food and other goods from up to 100 km away. Because of the size of these, they would have also needed a larger amount of control from the Rulers to oversee it. Eventually the increased trade, and growing cities gave the Rulers more power over their territory and their subjects. However, not only the central cities in the empire grew. Because of the increased amount of traffic through the smaller cities along trade routes, these once isolated cities grew too, creating a fairly consistent amount of growth throughout the Post-Classic period. Evidence discovered in the past few decades seems to prove that trade was widespread among the Maya. Artifacts collected under grants from the National Science Foundation, the National Geographic Society, and Howard University, show that hard stones and many other goods were moved great distances (despite the inefficiency of moving goods without so-called 'beasts of burden'). Modern chemical tests have taken these artifacts and confirmed that they originated in locations great distances away. There is also documented trade of goods ranging from honey to quetzal feathers throughout the Maya region. The goods, which were moved and traded around the empire at long distance, include: salt, cotton mantels, slaves, quetzal feathers, flint, chert, obsidian, jade, colored shells, Honey, cacao, copper tools, and ornaments. Due to the lack of wheeled cars and use of animals, these goods traveled Maya area by the sea. Because the Maya were so skilled at producing and distributing a wide variety of goods, they built a lifestyle based on trade throughout all of Mesoamerica, which spread to many different groups of people. It is suggested that because the Maya were so skilled as traders, they may have spared themselves from the wrath of the expanding Aztec empire. The Aztecs valued the Maya for their able to produce and trade a variety of different commodities, and because of this, the Aztecs did not feel the need to conquer the Maya. Commodities Raw obsidian and obsidian blades, examples of Maya commodities, As trade grew in the Postclassic period, so did the demand for commodities. Many of these were produced in large specialized factory-like workshops around the empire, and then transported elsewhere mostly by sea due to poor roads and heavy cargo. Some of these commodities included, fine ceramics, stone tools, paper, jade, pyrite, quetzal feathers, cocoa beans, obsidian, copper, bronze and salt. Mostly the main population used the more basic commodities, such as stone tools, salt, cacao beans, fish and manufactured goods such as books and ceramics and wood items. But some of the other commodities like gold, jade, copper, obsidian and other raw materials were goods that upper class and rulers used to show off their power. Salt Arguably the most important of these commodities was salt. Salt was not only an important part of the Maya diet, but it also was critical in the preservation of food. By covering meat and other food items in salt the Maya were able to dehydrate it so that it would not rot. Salt, for the most part, was produced near the oceans by drying out large flats of seawater. After the flats were dry, the salt could be collected and moved throughout the empire. The greatest producer of salt in all of Mesoamerica was Yucat√°n, in which the peoples specialized in salt collection and at one point monopolized the entire salt industry. Although there were several other salt wells further inland, the Yucat√°n people were able to monopolize the salt industry because sea salt was the most valuable and highly demanded kind of salt throughout the Mayan empire. It is estimated that the Early Classic Tikal's population of roughly 45,000 consumed approximately 131.4 tons of salt annually. Not only is it required in diet, but it can also be used as a preservative. Salt was also frequently used for ritual and medicinal purposes. It is also believed that salt was commonly used during childbirth and death. A midwife would offer salt to both parents at birth and a saline solution was sprinkled throughout the house following the death of a family member. Veterans of battle often wore armor, consisting of short cotton jackets packed with rock salt‚Äîthe equivalent of the modern \\"flack jacket\\" and tight bindings of leather or cloth on forearms and legs. Cotton armor is so much more effective than any other protection. Three major sources of Salt have been identified for the Pet√©n Lowlands Maya sites, the Pacific Lowlands, the Caribbean coast and the Salinas de los Nueve Cerros in the Chixoy river in the Highlands of Alta Verapaz in Guatemala, where the salt is obtained from a brine springs that flows from a Salt dome, curiously its color is black, this site produced an estimated of 2,000 tons per year. Other in- land sources such as San Mateo Ixtat√°n in Huehuetenango and Sacapulas in Quich√© also have been documented and are still in use. The Salt was obtained in disposable tin unfired brine-cooking vessels, such as the ones still used in Sacapulas and San Mateo Ixtat√°n, Guatemala, that not only evaporated the water, but made blocks of salt, the vessel was thus, a single use. In The Pacific Lowlands, platforms were used to obtain sun-dry salt, near La Blanca such platforms have been documented ca 1000 BC, and are perhaps the oldest in Mesoamerica. Both methods were used in the production of salt, as has been proved in Nueve Cerros by Andrews and Dillon. The salt was then transported using the river routes, such as the Chixoy, that forms the Usumacinta when it confluences with the Pasi√≥n river near Altar de Sacrificios. Cocoa  Chocolate was used throughout the Maya region to make sauces, and for drinks. It was grown mostly in the lowlands, so it was often transported to the highlands. Chocolate has a long and interesting history in Mesoamerica. From the very beginning of Mesoamerican culture some 3500 years ago, it has been associated with long distance trade and luxury. The Pacific Coast of Guatemala, thought to be the original source of Olmec culture, was, and remained, an important area of cacao cultivation. The Maya passed on the knowledge of cacao through oral histories, in Jade and Obsidian among other stonework, pottery and the creation of intricate, multicolored documents (codices) that extolled cacao and documented its use in everyday life and rituals, centuries before the arrival of the Spanish. In the centuries after initial contact between the Spaniards and indigenous peoples of the New World, hundreds of descriptive accounts, monographs and treatises were published that contained information on the agricultural, botanical, economic, geographical, historical, medical and nutritional aspects of cacao/chocolate. Ceramics and Furniture Ceramics and furniture were produced in specialized workshops, before being traded for other goods. Often the work produced by a particular artist, or workhouse was heavily sought after by the elite classes of Maya society and therefore artists were usually supported by and primarily catered to the wealthy. Art goods such as jade carvings, paintings, ornate furniture and metal ornaments were also circulated through kingdoms, and local areas amongst the elite classes. This was usually the case because of the strong symbol of power and wealth the fine arts provided. The ceramics produced were mainly plates, vases, and cylindrical drinking vessels. When painted, these pots were usually painted red, with gold and black detailing. Jade and Obsidian Rare stones such as jade and pyrite were also very important to the Maya elite. These stones were relatively hard to acquire, so having such treasures helped them to solidify their positions in the society. Many of the stones were collected in the highlands of the empire in Guatemala, so when long-distance trade developed, the Maya were able to move more of these precious stones to the lowland cities. The Jade route was mainly the Motagua river and a recently discovered land route in the Sierra de las Minas, and then distributed to all the Maya area and beyond, using canoes in the Caribbean routes, as well as the Pasi√≥n River route via the land route through Alta Verapaz. A unique and valuable trade item tends to become more valuable as it is traded farther from the source. The incentive is to profit by continuing to trade it until one of three things happens: an owner can't bear to part with it, it reaches a cultural area where it is not valued, or it reaches the bitter end of the trade route. For the jadeite axes found on the island of Antigua, the second and third may have both applied. Antigua was the far eastern edge of the Taino cultural area and of the Caribbean island chain. This finding is significant geologically and archaeologically as it argues for the primacy of Guatemala as the New World source of jadeite jade and refutes an assertion that all exotic gems and minerals in the Eastern Caribbean were sourced from South America, as no jadeite rock is known from there. (See Jade). The Caribbean route is also the most likely Olmec trade route for Jade. The fact that Cancu√©n appears to have prospered for hundreds of years without warfare and that commerce appeared to play a far more important role in everyday life than religion contradicts the widespread view among scholars that religion and warfare were the sources of power for Maya rulers, particularly toward the end of their dominance, after about 600 A.D. This is true also for the Obsidian, transported from the El Chayal ( north from Kaminaljuy√∫), San Mart√≠n Jilotepeque and from the Ixtepeque quarries, using a river that confluences with the Motagua River, then it was transported from the Caribbean shores, using the R√≠o Azul, Holmul River (Guatemala), and the Mopan River systems, to distribute it to the major centers in Pet√©n. In El Ba√∫l Cotzumalguapa, in the Pacific Lowlands, large workshops have been documented, the production of artifacts was aimed at manufacturing two major products: prismatic blades and projectile points. Both technological types required specialized skills and a centralized productive organization. The major purpose of this production was serving the local and probably the regional demand of cutting tools, throwing weapons with a cutting point, and instruments for scraping, polishing and perforating, all of which could be a part of household maintenance activities. Economic restructuring during the transition from the Classic to the Postclassic periods, as well as the beginning of trade over water, allowed for larger volumes of long-distance trade to occur, and therefore the commodities were able to reach throughout the entire Maya region. Preclassic Maya-Protoclassic Periods Obsidian Obsidian exchange in the Preclassic Maya period (2000 BC- 250 AD) largely focused on importing large macrocores and flake nodes from Guatemalan highland sources such as Ixtepeque, San Martin Jilotepeque, and El Chayal. The varying presence and proportions of these different highland obsidian sources at sites across the Maya lowlands suggest multiple trade networks operating independently during the Preclassic. The Tajumulco obsidian source was used as early as the Archaic period (3500-2000 BC) and the Ixtepeque, El Chayal, and San Martin Jilotepque sources were utilized beginning in the Early Preclassic as evidenced by Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis, or INAA (Asaro et al. 1978:439). El Chayal obsidian from the Guatemalan highlands being found at Preclassic levels in Olmec regions on the Southern Gulf Coast and throughout the Yucat√°n peninsula point to extensive trade networks connecting the Maya region to other parts of Mesoamerica (Asaro et al. 1978; Hirth et al. 2013). The Northern Belize site of Colha demonstrates the recognition of obsidian as a utilitarian resource during the Preclassic, even when other lithic resources such as chert deposits are locally available (Brown et al. 2004). Preclassic people in the Copan Valley in Western Honduras utilized obsidian primarily from the Guatemalan highlands but also in small quantities from La Esperanza in Honduras and Ucareo and Pachuca in Central Mexico (Aoyama 2001). This is further evidence of extensive trade networks operating in the Preclassic. Copan demonstrates that there was variation in obsidian technology and trade in the Preclassic. This region did not feature blade production technology until the Late Preclassic, instead primarily relying on informal nodes and flakes with very limited trade of prismatic blades, which is abnormal when compared to surrounding areas (Aoyama 2001). Some regions, such as the inland Central Pet√©n and the Puuc region in Northern Yucat√°n, had relatively low access to obsidian despite drawing from the same primary sources of Ixtepeque, San Martin Jilotepeque, and El Chayal in the Guatemalan highlands as other regions of Mesoamerica (Rice 1984; Braswell et al. 2011). This variation has been explained by examining potential inland and riverine trade routes that when combined allow for further transport of bulk obsidian from highlands into lowlands as well as competing commercial and distributional systems created by sociopolitical relationships (Hester et al. 1980; Hammon 1972). More recent network analyses that examine the distribution of obsidian and relationship between actors in the exchange systems aid in understanding this variation as well. These network cluster models highlight the prominence of the Southern Gulf region creating connections between Eastern and Western Mesoamerican obsidian exchange as well as the Pacific coastal region bridging the gap as well (Golitko and Feinman 2015). This could explain the lower quantities and smaller scale of obsidian production in the Maya region during the Preclassic. The Protoclassic is growing in acceptance as a distinct period in Maya history, but is generally referred to as the Terminal Preclassic (0 ‚Äì 250 AD). Increases in obsidian production technology, procurement, and distribution can be used as lines of evidence in this debate. In Copan and its hinterland regions the pattern of large flakes spalls and small nodules continued until the late Protoclassic when the population increased and a subsequent rise in production technology (Aoyama 2001). Polyhedral cores and blade production debitage are noted in assemblages related to principle urban group residences suggesting political control by a ruler over obsidian trade and distribution (Aoyama 2001). This time period is also when Teotihuacan was established and rose to prominence in Central Mexico. It has been theorized that Teotihuacan dominated the procurement of nearby obsidian sources and controlled the trade of obsidian into the Maya region due to the increasing presence of Central Mexican obsidian in Maya contexts (Aoyama 2001; Braswell et al. 2011; Hammon 1972). Network clustering and distribution analysis shows Teotihuacan as not being thoroughly connected to the overall obsidian exchange systems during the Protoclassic which means control over obsidian cannot explain the city's rise to prominence (Golitko and Feinman 2015; Spence 1996). During this time there was also a considerable decrease across the Maya region in the use of Ixtepeque and San Martin Jiotepeque obsidian and increases in El Chayal obsidian; a pattern that continued into the Classic (Hester et al. 1980; Moholy-Nagy et al. 1984; Healy et al. 1984). Classic Period Obsidian The Classic period Maya region featured large scale prismatic blade production, the exchange of polyhedral cores, and large scale sociopolitical and economic organization (Moholy-Nagy et al. 1984; Knight and Glascock 2009). A very common form of obsidian used to transport it and derive blades from was the polyhedral core, which was most frequently used from the Early to Late Classic (Trachman 1999). Prismatic blades made from polyhedral cores have been found at Copan and its hinterland regions; a dramatic increase in these blades during the Classic has been attributed to a royal dynasty assuming control over procurement of obsidian and production at two workshops in Copan's epicenter (Aoyama 2001). Most of this obsidian came from the Ixtepeque source to make utilitarian blades that all residents had access to, but green obsidian from central Mexico has been found in elite contexts, suggesting long distance exchange ties to Teotihuacan (Aoyama 2001). It is now believed that Classic Maya cities were highly integrated and urbanized, featuring marketplaces and market economies to exchange many goods including obsidian. A market exchange mechanism has been noted at Classic period Calakmul murals that depict a range of specialists near an area that appears to be a market (Feinman and Garraty 2010). Linguistic evidence shows that there are words in the Yucatec Maya language for ‚Äúmarket‚Äù and ‚Äúwhere one buys and sells‚Äù (Coronel et al. 2015). Network and cluster analyses show Teotihuacan as being more integrated into the overall obsidian exchange network, but not as highly involved as traditionally believed in the literature that posits the city as the dominate connection between East-West Pachuca, Otumba, and Ucareo obsidian exchange networks (Golitko and Feinman 2015). The Maya region is highly integrated into the overall network but it appears that several routes connected the East and West due to the variety of large, urbanized Maya centers as well as marketplace distribution economies (Golitko and Feinman 2015). Teotihuacan is not the superordinate obsidian source for Classic Maya centers, but rather just one large node in the overall system (Golitko and Feinman 2015). El Chayal appears as the dominant source in many regions during the Early Classic, such as Chunchucmil, Wild Cane Cay, Tikal, the Puuc region, the Peten, and Usamacinta River Basin (Braswell et al. 2011; Hammon 1972; Hutson et al. 2010; Moholy-Nagy 1984; McKillop 1989). Tikal played a crucial role in obsidian procurement, production, and distribution during the Classic. Tikal dominated the Great Western Trade Route that transported the widely used El Chayal obsidian during the Early Classic (250-550 AD), sharing dominion with Calakmul and Dos Pilas during the Late Classic (Woodfill and Andrieu 2012). At Tikal, the El Chayal obsidian core to blade ratio discovered was 1:22; this overrepresentation of cores suggests blades being produced and distributed from Tikal through a unique economic system and control over a major trade route (Woodfill and Andrieu 2012). During the Late Classic the Northern Lowlands and Yucutan Peninsula feature prominent East-West obsidian connections, likely due to the decline of Teotihuacan and the Southern Maya Lowland region (Golitko and Feinman 2010). At Late Classic Coba, marketplaces were determined to have existed in two large plazas that featured multiple causeway entrances, linear/parallel market stall architecture, and geochemical signatures of high Phosphorus levels in arranged patterns which indicate the presence of traded organic goods (Coronel et al. 2015). In the Puuc region, more central Mexican obsidian entered and while it does appear to be limited to elites only it does appear to be a highly commercialized and valued exchange good linked to Chichen Itza and market distribution (Braswell et al. 2011). The Ixtepeque source dominated at Copan in the Late/Terminal Classic but it is found more frequently in blade and spear tip forms suggesting instability concurrent with regional collapse at the time (Aoyama 2001). The gradual decline of Chichen Itza beginning in the Terminal Classic and lasting into the Early Postclassic is noted in obsidian cluster and network analyses through a much weaker connection between East and West Mesoamerica; Guatemalan and Honduras sources used in that region and Central Mexican sources used in that region which much less exchange occurring (Golitko and Feinman 2014). Post-Classic Period Obsidian Obsidian trade was largely relegated to the coast with the collapse of Classic Maya society in the Northern and Southern Lowland regions that occupied the inland areas the Yucutan and River basins. The period from 900-1500 AD saw 80% of the population in the Yucutan remain within 50 km of the coast (Rathje and Sabloff 1973). Chichen Itza and Cozumel were used as trading bases by invaders in the Early Postclassic but after a mainland collapse the centralized commercial systems in place collapsed as well (Rathje and Sabloff 1973). For Postclassic Copan, an obsidian pattern similar to the Preclassic returned; nonspecialized production utilizing Ixtepeque obsidian used smaller flakes as opposed to polyhedral cores, resulting in fewer prismatic blades and an overall decline in the quantity and quality of utilitarian obsidian found at the site (Aoyama 2001). Obsidian network and cluster analysis shows weak integration in the Early Postclassic but overall greater integration focused on coastal trade nodes for the Late Postclassic Maya region with reformed connections between East and West, but the inland routes do not regain their former prominence (Golitko and Feinman 2015). Very little Central Mexican obsidian is found among Postclassic sites; much of it is believed to be recycled from earlier periods. The site of Colha in Belize utilized Ixtepeque in the Postclassic (Hester et al. 1980). The island site of Wild Cane Cay near Belize was an important port of trade for obsidian among the Postclassic Maya. Obsidian found at Wild Cane Cay is primarily from Highland Guatemala sources but there is some from Central Mexico, with an 80% increase in overall densities mainly in the form of cores during the Postclassic (Mckillop 1989). An estimated 21,686 cores overwhelmingly linked to production areas is recorded for the Postclassic at this site which far exceeds household needs (Mckillop 1989). This positions Wild Cane Cay as an important port of trade in the Postclassic exchange system of obsidian. Ambergis Key on the coast of Belize shows procurement of already reduced polyhedral cores primarily from Ixtepeque obsidian, but other Guatemalan sources are noted (Stemp et al. 2011). The arrival of the Spanish pushed the coastal Maya back inland, disrupting obsidian trade systems developed during the Postclassic which caused the use of recycled cored to rise (Stemp et al. 2011).

The 9th Armoured Brigade was formed by the redesignation of the 4th Cavalry Brigade, a 1st Line Yeomanry (mounted) brigade in the Territorial Army, which had been part of the 1st Cavalry Division. It was converted to an armoured role on 3 August 1941 in the Middle East, and joined the 10th Armoured Division. Second World War  El Alamein  During the North Africa campaign, the Brigade was commanded by Brigadier J.C.Currie and fought at the Second Battle of El Alamein. Its units were: Sherman tank of 3rd Hussars, 9th Armoured Brigade, 7 July 1944. * 3rd Hussars * Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry * Warwickshire Yeomanry * 9th Armoured Brigade Signal Squadron (Middlesex Yeomanry), Royal Corps of Signals The Brigade was nominally independent, but was placed under command of the 2nd New Zealand Division specifically for the El Alamein battle. Following permission given by the New Zealanders, they proudly painted the Kiwis' divisional sign on their tanks.Bryn Hammond, El Alamein: The Battle that Turned the Tide of the Second World War, Osprey Publishing, 2012, 157, citing Kippenberger. The NZ infantry gained their objectives, but as with Operation Lightfoot on the first day of the battle, lanes could not be cleared through the minefields until night was almost over. 9th Armoured Brigade was forced to make its attack silhouetted by the early daylight. As dawn came on 2 November, tank after tank was hit by the German 88 mm guns that kept firing through seven air attacks. The 9th never reached their objective. In fact, they took 75 percent casualties and lost 102 of their 128 tanks. Nevertheless, they breached the gun line and the 1st Armoured Division of X Corps, under the command of Raymond Briggs, was now able to engage. After the Brigade's action, Brigadier Gentry of the 6th New Zealand Brigade went ahead to survey the scene. On seeing Brigadier Currie asleep on a stretcher, he approached him saying, 'Sorry to wake you John, but I'd like to know where your tanks are?' Currie waved his hand at a group of tanks around him, replying 'There they are.' Gentry was puzzled. 'I don't mean your headquarters tanks, I mean your armoured regiments. Where are they?' Currie waved his arm and again replied, 'There are my armoured regiments, Bill.‚Äô C.E. Lucas-Phillips, Alamein, (London: Heinemann, 1962) 358 Nevertheless, the assault of 2nd New Zealand Division had drawn in both 15 and 21 Panzer Divisions, with the result that there was a wide gap in the Axis lines to the south west. Through this gap, Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery, commander of 8th Army, pushed the remainder of his armour, breaking the Afrika Korps line and pushing westwards into its rear areas and supply lines. By 4 November, the battle was won and Montgomery was entertaining the captured Afrika Korps commander, Wilhelm von Thoma, to dinner in his caravan.Hamilton, Monty, 147. In an account of the battle published to mark its 25th anniversary, Montgomery wrote: > I must mention the magnificent fight put up by 9th Armoured Brigade - 3rd > Hussars, Wiltshire Yeomanry, Warwickshire Yeomanry.... If the British armour > owed any debt to the infantry of 8th army, the debt was paid on 2 November > by 9th Armoured Brigade in heroism and blood....The Times, 11 May 1967. General Bernard Freyberg, the NZ Division's commander, also paid tribute to the gallant support provided by the brigade.174 ‚Äî General Freyberg to the Minister of Defence NZETC Post Alamein After the battle, the 9th Armoured Brigade, which had been reduced to a handful of operational tanks, was withdrawn to Syria to regroup and undertake internal security duties. In 1944, the Brigade (with the same three constituent Regiments) fought in the Italian Campaign in support of the British 78th, 4th Indian and 10th Indian Infantry Divisions. Post War After the reformation of the Territorial Army in 1947, the brigade was reformed as an independent formation within Northern Command. It was almost certainly disbanded by the time that the Territorial Army Volunteer Reserve was formed in 1967.

It is a census county division (CCD), with a population at the 2010 census of 72. Geography A building in Cherry Creek that belongs to the Rude Family from California. This old cabin built out of railroad ties was the assay office during the mining operations and is now used as a hunting cabin The community of Cherry Creek is located in the northern part of the long Steptoe Valley, north of the modern communities of McGill and Ely. Immediately to the west is the Cherry Creek Range, while to the east is U.S. Route 93 and the Schell Creek Range. Just to the south, in Egan Canyon, the Pony Express and subsequent stage lines made their way through the mountains of central Nevada in the 1860s. History Cherry Creek has existed as a community for over 140 years. Founding In the early 1860s, the area around Cherry Creek was discovered to have substantial mineral deposits of gold and silver. The community was founded on September 21, 1872 when two prospectors from nearby Egan Canyon located the \\"Tea Cup\\" claims, rich deposits of silver and gold ore. By spring of 1873, the community had an estimated population of 400. Boom and bust In 1873, Cherry Creek included a livery stable, a blacksmith shop, a large hotel, several boarding houses, restaurants, and more than twenty saloons. Cherry Creek continued to grow in 1873. Wells Fargo opened a station in Cherry Creek, and the Cherry Creek post office also opened for business in 1873. However, in early 1874, most of the original mineral claims in the area began to play out. As a result, Cherry Creek's economy and population began a decline, and by 1875, although limited production continued, most of the local mills and mines had closed. For 1875‚Äì1880, Cherry Creek remained a small mining community, sustaining a much smaller population and workforce than it had during the prosperous years of 1872‚Äì1874. Cherry Creek's economy and population rapidly expanded once more in 1880, when additional deposits of gold and silver were discovered. Over the next two years, Cherry Creek experienced its biggest boom. By the end of 1881, a single one of the larger mines locally employed over 200 men. Cherry Creek became the largest voting precinct in White Pine County. By 1882, the community was at its peak, with both its economy and population exceeding their previous highs during the boom of 1873‚Äì1874. During 1882, the community was estimated to have a population of 7,800, of which 6,000 were estimated to be transient mine workers. During this time, 28 saloons were located in Cherry Creek. There were also a substantial variety of stores and local businesses, most catering to local mine workers. A stagecoach route to Toano, in Elko County, was created and in service during this time. By the end of 1882, one local mine had produced more than one million dollars in gold bullion, a huge amount for the time. The boom of 1880‚Äì1883 was the most economically prosperous period in Cherry Creek's history. In 1883, a financial crash devastated the local economy. Many mines closed, and the community entered a rapid decline. In 1888, a fire destroyed a substantial portion of the town's business district. By the census of 1890, the population had fallen to 350. Cherry Creek experienced large, damaging fires in 1901 and 1904. Many of the original buildings in the community were burnt down and had to be rebuilt. In 1905, Cherry Creek's economy experienced a modest revival when a number of local mines reopened. Cherry Creek remained the home of several hundred people, and the base of substantial mining activity, until the late 1940s. Present day The old meeting house Since the 1940s, the community has slowly declined in size, although mine leaseholders have always been active in the district, and occasional mining activity has taken place. Total production for the district since 1872 has been estimated at roughly 20 million dollars. Throughout the 2000s, the \\"Barrel Saloon\\" a local business, remained open; however, it closed in July 2010. Many historic structures, including a museum, an early one-room schoolhouse, and the Cherry Creek Barrel Saloon, still stand among more modern buildings. Climate Like most of the Great Basin, Cherry Creek experiences a semi-arid climate with cold winters and warm to hot summers. Winters are long and tend to be both dry and cold. Daytime highs are usually only a few degrees above freezing, and nighttime temperatures are bitterly cold. Summer days can be hot, but Cherry Creek's low humidity and high altitude temper the effects of the heat. Nights are cool, even in the summer. At Cherry Creek's high elevation, the thin, dry air cools quickly after sunset.

The organization works closely with the Vermont General Assembly, the Curator of State Buildings, the Office of the Sergeant at Arms, and other government officials to maintain the historic and symbolic dignity of the building. Membership is open to all, and the organization is self-governing. Mission statement The Friends of the Vermont State House describes it mission as \\"a non-profit corporation dedicated to the fulfillment of the Capitol building's full potential as the structure of first importance to Vermont. To accomplish this, the Friends focus on conservation and restoration of the Capitol's historic integrity and promotion of public appreciation of the building and its collections. We work in close cooperation with the Legislature and government officials to ensure that the historic and symbolic dignity of the building continues to enhance the vital continuing function it fills.\\" Restoration guided by scholarship In the early 1980s the Friends commissioned a master plan for the long term restoration of the building. Research was undertaken using historic documents, photographs, stereoscope views, drawings, and plans for the 1859 building. The Friends funded a curator and tour guide coordinator, both positions the state government came to realize deserved state funding. The master plan examined the whole building through its history, giving consideration to the range of period styles various rooms had undergone over time. Much of the initial work was towards negating the results of a 1970 renovation that paid little attention to historic scholarship. As the plan emerged, a complex schedule based on the building's heavy use during the legislative session needed to be negotiated. Over the course of twenty years, a dramatic transformation has occurred. The two main legislative chambers have been restored to their 1859 appearance. Period furniture upholstered in a vinyl product in the 1970s were restored using authentic silk satin, silk velvet, and horsehair fabrics. Complex period carpeting was rewoven and installed, chandeliers and sconces were restored, and new drapery based on old photographs were recreated and hung. Today, the Vermont State House shines; the New York Times has described it as being \\"like a Faberg√© egg.\\" Whereas the taxpayers may finance large ticket items, like new carpeting and restoration of plaster, the Friends help acquire special pieces with a history associated with the State House. Recently, the Friends acquired a c. 1858 bronze desk lamp with the sculptor Hiram Powers' figure of the Greek Slave cast in ormolu. The Friends have recently published a new book, \\"Intimate Grandeur,\\" documenting the history of the State House. Funding The Friends of the Vermont State House have raised and spent well over a million dollars on the building's restoration. Funding comes from membership; individual contributions; sale of books and items in their gift shop, \\"Under the Dome\\"; and through special events, many held in the State House. Interpretation Through special events, and lectures, but more often through on-site interpretation by volunteer tour guides, the Friends help tourists, local residents, and sometimes even members of the General Assembly, better know and appreciate the State House. The Friends have brought historic preservation architects, artisans and crafts people, historians, musicians, and writers to the State House for public events. Volunteer tour guides take groups through the State House and show the real life workings of Vermont's seat of government.

It is an affiliate of the Zionist Federation in the UK and thus a formal part of the Zionist Movement. The group aims to convince European parliamentarians (either MEPs or MPs) to lobby for Israeli interests primarily in the European Union, but also at the individual European country level. EFI's chief executive has stated: 'We have set ourselves a target to turn Europe into Israel's ally.'Itamar Eichner, First pro-Israel lobby in EU set up, YNet News, 6 September 2011, accessed 19 October 2012 History Established in September 2006 by 300 MEPs and national MPs, European Friends of Israel aimed to bring together every national parliamentary friendship group with Israel from the EU 27 Member States, together with the friendship group with Israel within the European Parliament. EFI monitored all legislation that impacts Israel and supported many initiatives to help Israel exist within safe and secure borders. Its chairman was Marek Siwiec. The EFI recorded in the EU transparency register that it operated on a budget of 400,000 Euros in 2010, but estimated that its costs 'directly related to representing interests to EU institutions in that year' were less than 50,000 Euros.European Friends of Israel profile, EU Transparency Register, accessed 19 October 2012 The group is not transparent about where the majority of its funding comes from. However, according to the Jerusalem Post, one major donor is Alexander Machkevitch.Gil Shefler, 450 MPs from 37 European countries come to promote friendship with Israel, Jerusalem Post, 6 February 2011, accessed 19 October 2012 David Cronin claims that when he asked for details of how the organisation was funded EFI stated that donors were private European individuals - and he questions whether this was 'economical with the truth' given that Machketevitch is an Israeli citizen.David Cronin, \\"The Rise of the Israel Lobby in Europe\\", in Duad Abdullah and Ibrahim Hewitt (eds.), The Battle for Public Opinion in Europe, London, MEMO Publishers, 2012 p.65 However, in October 2012 EFI's website had no information about the nationality or identity of any of its funders. Executive director Michel Gourary stated in 2011 that most of the group's donors are from Western Europe, including 'businessmen and women from the UK, Greece, Spain, Italy and Germany'.Gil Shefler, 450 MPs from 37 European countries come to promote friendship with Israel, Jerusalem Post, 6 February 2011, accessed 19 October 2012  Influence  EFI mustered 1,000 participants from all over Europe, the largest support group of its kind in the region, attracting more than 1,500 European parliamentarians and policymakers. In an official statement, EFI maintained that \\"Israel needs and deserves a better recognition of the close cultural and democratic bonds that it shares with the EU, to underpin greater EU support for the continuing challenges it faces over the coming years.\\" High-level pronouncements reinforce how EFI recognizes Israel's bond with Europe but consistently highlight the lack of recognition. This is the element that sets the organization apart from other Israeli groups or pro-Israel grassroots NGOs in Europe. According to Siwiec, EFI mainly focused on elected political representatives with the goal of bringing together Israel-friendly EU Parliament. EFI was considered a lobby group and likened to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) in terms of its goals and initiatives. Studies showed the efficacy of the group thanks to its financial power and well-organized structure.

On 7 March 2007, it held a conference calling for \\"Economic Sanctions against Iran\\". In 2007, EFI led 3 separate missions to EU member states. During a 2 days mission to Portugal in January, EFI‚Äôs team met with the newly Portuguese Parliamentary Friendship Group with Israel. In Spain in February it met many high-level politicians from the leading political factions. In May, EFI met many Members of the Maltese parliament and other foreign officials.

The program included meetings with the Prime Minister of Israel, Ehud Olmert, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Tsipi Livni and other high-ranking Israeli officials. On the occasion of the European Holocaust Remembrance Day (26-27 January 2008), EFI organized a 2-day mission to Auschwitz. The Delegation was composed of Members of the European Parliament, Members of the EU Member States' Parliaments as well as Members of the Knesset. On the occasion of Israel's 60th anniversary, EFI collaborated with B'nai B'rith, Peres Center for Peace and the Israeli Mission to the EU to organize workshops, conferences and panels on Israel-related topics and Israel's relations with the European Union. On the 6/7 November 2008, The EFI Policy Conference gathered together hundreds of Parliamentarians and high- officials from 42 European countries, including Members of the European Parliament, Members of the Council of Europe as well as Members of the Knesset.

The Muslim minority of Greece is the only explicitly recognized minority in Greece. It numbered 97,605 (0.91% of the population) according to the 1991 census, and unofficial estimates ranged up to 140,000 people or 1.24% of the total population, according to the United States Department of State. US Department of State - Religious Freedom, Greece Like other parts of the southern Balkans that experienced centuries of Ottoman rule the Muslim minority of mainly Western Thrace in Northern Greece consists of several ethnic groups, some being Turkish and some Bulgarian-speaking Pomaks, with smaller numbers descended from Ottoman-era Greek converts to Islam and Muslim Romas. The precise identity of these groups is in contention with Turkey insisting that most Muslims in Western Thrace are ethnically Turkish, and Greece claiming many are Pomak and others of local origin who converted to Islam and adopted the Turkish language and identity in the Ottoman period. These arguments have territorial overtones, since the self-identity of the Muslims in Western Thrace could conceivably support territorial claims to the region by Turkey.See Hugh Poulton, 'The Balkans: minorities and states in conflict', Minority Rights Publications, 1991. The Muslims of Western Thrace and the Greeks of Istanbul were exempt from the 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey when 1.3 million Anatolian Greeks or Pontic Greeks and Caucasus Greeks were required to leave Turkey, and the 400,000 Muslims outside of Thrace were required to leave Greece, including the Muslim Greek speaking Vallahades of western Greek Macedonia. Consequently, most of the Muslim minority in Greece resides in the Greek region of Thrace, where they make up 28.88% of the population. Muslims form the largest group in the Rhodope regional unit (54.77%) and sizable percentages in the Xanthi (42.19%) and Evros regional units (6.65%). In contrast to the steady number of Greece's Muslim minority since 1923, Turkey's Greek minority has shrunk considerably due to oppression and violence orchestrated by the Turkish state in particular the 1955 Istanbul pogrom. Nearly 3,500 Turks remain on the island of Rhodes and 2,000 on the island of Kos, as the islands were part of the Italian Dodecanese when the population exchange between Turkey and Greece happened (and so were not included in it). The Sharia law used to be mandatory among the Muslim citizens of Greece, as a result of the Lausanne Treaty which was signed between Greece and Turkey in 1923. However, according to a 2018 European Court of Human Rights ruling, applying Sharia law on the Muslim minority was considered a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights by Greece. The court ruled unanimously that the mandatory application of Sharia law in Greece violated Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination) of the European Convention on Human Rights. Court also added that \\"Greece is the only country in Europe which had applied Sharia law to a section of its citizens against their wishes\\". Lawyers said that this was a big step since, from now on, the minority's issues would be judged according to the Greek law, which give same rights to men and women, and not sharia. Later this year, the Greek government drafted a bill eliminating the mandatory enforcement of the Sharia Law, and limiting its powers, making it optional, which, according to the then PM Alexis Tsipras, \\"expands the equality and equity enjoyed by all Greeks without exceptions\\". The bill passed by the Greek Parliament and was hailed by the Muslim minority as a historic step.  Background  Under the Treaty of Lausanne, 1923, Greece and Turkey conducted a population exchange: all the Greek Orthodox Christians of Turkey would be resettled in Greece apart from the Greeks of Istanbul (Constantinople), Imbros (G√∂k√ßeada) and Tenedos (Bozcaada), and all Turks of Greece would be resettled in Turkey apart from the Muslims of Greek Thrace.Ethnic composition of the central Balkans (including present-day Greek Thrace) in 1870. The exchanged populations were not homogenous; the Christians resettled in Greece included not only Greek speakers, but also Laz speakers, Arabic speakers and even Turkish speakers. Similarly, the Muslims resettled in Turkey included not only Turkish speakers, but also Albanian speakers, Bulgarian speakers, Vlach speakers and also Greek speakers like the Vallahades from western Greek Macedonia (see also Greek Muslims). This was in correspondence with the Millet system of the Ottoman Empire, where religious and national allegiance coincided, and thus Greece and Turkey were considered the parent state of each group respectively. In 1922, the Muslim minority left in Western Thrace, in Northern Greece, numbered approximately 86,000 people, and consisted of three ethnic groups: Turks (here usually referred to as Western Thrace Turks), Pomaks (Muslim Slavs who speak Bulgarian), and Muslim Roma, each of these groups having its own language and culture. The official Greek text of the Treaty of Lausanne refers to \\"muslim minorities\\" in article 45Treaty of Lausanne. Part 1, Peace Treaty. Article 45: \\"Œ§Œ± Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ≥ŒΩœâœÅŒπœÉŒ∏Œ≠ŒΩœÑŒ± Œ¥ŒπŒ± œÑœâŒΩ Œ¥ŒπŒ±œÑŒ¨ŒæŒµœâŒΩ œÑŒøœÖ œÄŒ±œÅœåŒΩœÑŒøœÇ Œ§ŒºŒÆŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ Œ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒπœéŒºŒ±œÑŒ± ŒµŒπœÇ œÑŒ±œÇ ŒµŒΩ Œ§ŒøœÖœÅŒ∫ŒØŒ± ŒºŒ∑ ŒºŒøœÖœÉŒøœÖŒªŒºŒ±ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ¨œÇ ŒºŒµŒπŒøŒΩœåœÑŒ∑œÑŒ±œÇ, Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ≥ŒΩœâœÅŒØŒ∂ŒøŒΩœÑŒ±Œπ ŒµœÄŒØœÉŒ∑œÇ œÖœÄœå œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒïŒªŒªŒ¨Œ¥ŒøœÇ ŒµŒπœÇ œÑŒ±œÇ ŒµŒΩ œÑœâ ŒµŒ¥Œ¨œÜŒµŒπ Œ±œÖœÑŒÆœÇ ŒµœÖœÅŒπœÉŒ∫ŒøŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ±œÇ ŒºŒøœÖœÉŒøœÖŒªŒºŒ±ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ¨œÇ ŒºŒµŒπŒøŒΩœåœÑŒ∑œÑŒ±œÇ\\". \\"The rights which are recognized hereby for the non-muslim minorities living in Turkey, are also recognized by Greece for the muslim minorities on Greek territory.\\" However, unofficial texts of the Greek State refer to one Muslim minority. According to the Greek government, Turkish speakers form approximately 50% of the minority, Pomaks 35% and Muslim Roma 15%. The minority enjoys full equality with the Greek majority, and prohibition against discrimination and freedom of religion are provided for in Article 5 and Article 13 of the Greek constitution.Report about Compliance with the Principles of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities , by the Greek Helsinki Monitor, 18 September 1999 In Thrace today there are 3 muftis, approximately 270 imams and approximately 300 mosques.Œúuslim Minority of Thrace by the Greek ministry of foreign affairs  Politics  The minority is always represented in the Greek parliament, and is currently represented by PASOK members √áetin Mandacƒ± and Ahmet Hacƒ±osman.

In the remote mountainous areas of Xanthi where the Pomak element is dominant, the Greek government has set up Greek language secondary education schools in which religious studies is taught in Turkish and the Quran is taught in Arabic. The Pomak language (which is essentially considered a dialect of Bulgarian), however, is not taught at any level of the education system.Report on the Pomaks, by the Greek Helsinki Monitor The government finances the transportation to and from the schools for students who live in remote areas, and in the academic year 1997-98, approximately 195,000 USD was spent on transportation. There are two Islamic theological seminaries, one in Komotini, and one in Echinos (a small town in Xanthi regional unit inhabited almost exclusively by Pomaks), and under Law 2621/1998, the qualification awarded by these institutions has been recognized as equal to that of the Greek Orthodox seminaries in the country. Finally, 0.5% of places in Greek higher education institutions are reserved for members of the minority. All the aforementioned institutions are funded by the state.United States Department of State: International Religious Freedom Report 2006  Issues  The main minority grievance regards the appointment of muftis. The Greek government started appointing muftis instead of holding elections after the death of Mufti of Komotini in 1985, although the Greek government maintained that as the practice of state-appointed muftis is widespread (including in Turkey), this practice should be adhered to in Greece, and as the muftis perform certain judicial functions in matters of family and inheritance law, the state ought to appoint them. Human Rights Watch alleges that this is against Lausanne Treaty which grants the Muslim minority the right to organize and conduct religious affairs free from government interference (although it is unclear whether issues such as inheritance law are religious matters). As such, there are two muftis for each post, one elected by the participating faithful, and one appointed by Presidential Decree. The elected Mufti of Xanthi is Mr Aga and the government recognized one is Mr Sinikoƒülu; the elected Mufti of Komotini is Mr ≈ûerif and the government recognized one is Mr Cemali. According to the Greek government, the elections by which Mr Aga and Mr ≈ûerif were appointed were rigged and involved very little participation from the minority. As pretension of (religious) authority is a criminal offence against the lawful muftis under the Greek Penal Code, both elected muftis were prosecuted and on conviction, both were imprisoned and fined. When, however, the case was taken to the European Court of Human Rights, the Greek government was found to have violated the right to religious freedom of Mr Aga and Mr ≈ûerif. Another controversial issue was Article 19 of the Greek Citizenship Code, which allowed the government to revoke the citizenship of non-ethnic Greeks who left the country. According to official statistics 46,638 Muslims (most of them being of Turkish origin) from Thrace and the Dodecanese islands lost their citizenships from 1955 to 1998, until the law was non-retroactively abolished in 1998.Press Release of Federation of Western Thrace Turks in Europe and HRW World Report 1999: Greece:Human Rights Developments The final controversial issue is the use of the ethnic terms \\"Turk\\" and \\"Turkish\\" when describing the religious minority as a whole. The Greek government does not refer to the Muslim minority by a specific ethnic background such as Turks, as it is a multi-ethnic minority that includes ethnic Greek Muslims, Pomaks and Roma Muslims as well. However, a number of organizations which are doing so, including the \\"Turkish Union of Xanthi\\", have been banned for using those terms in their title. A decision of the European Court of Human Rights in 2008 convicted Greece of violating the freedom of association and ruled the re- legalization of the association. However, the Greek authorities refused to re- legalize it.2009 Human Rights Report: Greece U.S Department of State See also *Minorities in Greece *Demographics of Greece *Turks of Western Thrace *Turks of the Dodecanese *Provisional Government of Western Thrace *Pomaks *Treaty of Lausanne *1990 Komotini events References Further reading * External links * Ramadanoglou case Greece Helsinki Monitor Category:Ethnic groups in Greece Category:Greek society Category:Islam in Greece Category:Greece‚ÄìTurkey relations Category:Western Thrace Category:Pomaks Category:Turks in Greece * ","title":"Muslim minority of Greece"},{"id":"7083805","text":"Without Walls Central Church was a Christian megachurch in Auburndale, Florida outside Lakeland co-founded by Paula and Randy White, in January 2004, when they were still married.

History In one year, the congregation grew from 125 to over 1,500. With growth of this scale, the Auburndale facility quickly became inadequate and, in April 2005, Pastor Scott began two Sunday morning worship services to accommodate the attendance. This, however, was only a short-term solution, as in September 2005, Without Walls Central Church moved to a new location at the former facility of Carpenter's Home Church in Lakeland, Florida. Pastors Scott and Cindy Thomas were the senior pastors at the church. Its operations included citywide ministry outreaches and relationships with city schools, businessmen, and government officials; networking with community organizations to help local residents; bringing well-known Christian artists and ministers to the community; and participating in city- and county- sponsored community activities. In 2011, the Without Walls Central Church vacated the Lakeland building, as a result of debts.Randy White's Church Aims to Turn Bankruptcy Into Blessing The United States bankruptcy court required Without Walls to sell their properties.

It was a complex blend of mind, body, religion, ritual and science. Important to all, medicine was practiced only by a select few, who generally inherited their positions and received extensive education. These shamans acted as a medium between the physical world and spirit world. They practiced sorcery for the purpose of healing, foresight, and control over natural events. Since medicine was so closely related to religion, it was essential that Maya medicine men had vast medical knowledge and skill. In understanding Maya medicine, it is important to recognize that the Maya equated sickness with the captivity of one's soul by supernatural beings, angered by some perceived misbehavior.Colby, 84 For this reason, curing a sickness involved elements of ritual, cleansing and herbal remedy. Research of Maya ethno-medicine shows that though supernatural causes are related to illness, a large percentage of Maya medical texts are devoted to the treatment of symptoms based upon objective observations of the effects of certain plants on the human system.Roys 20 Herbal remedies were ingested, smoked, snorted, rubbed on the skin, and even used in the form of enemas to force rapid absorption of a substance into the blood stream. Cleansing techniques included fasting, sweating and purging flushed substances out of the body.Houston, Stuart, & Taube, 277 Medicine Medicine men, known to the ancient Maya as ah-men, held the special ability to alter consciousness to determine causes for events not understood, such as reasons for illness or misfortune.Sharer 750 Since it was perceived by the Maya that sickness was a punishment for a mistake or transgression, it was important that the healer inquire about details of the past of the sick person. This was done in a methodological fashion, first inquiring about ascriptive attributes, followed by specific events of the person's life, and lastly about circumstantial or acquired attributes.Colby, 90 This aspect of the medicine man's job would be similar to a modern-day therapy session. In addition to ritualistic and spiritual elements, the medicine man had extensive knowledge of medicinal plants and how they should be used. After studying the symptoms of a sickness, a medicine man may prescribe a remedy to his patient. The number of times or days that the remedy should be ingested or applied depended on an individual's gender; typically the number thirteen was associated with men, and the number nine with women. The Maya had a broad range of vocabulary to describe internal human anatomy, such as hobnel for intestines and kah for bile, as well as knowledge of general functions of body systems, in particular the female reproductive system. In pathology, over two hundred terms described organic conditions, such as thuhuzen meaning a deep bronchial cough, zen meaning largyneal cough, and tiptec meaning intestinal pain with pulsation, speculated to have been appendicitis. The Maya acknowledged mental afflictions such as melancholia and hallucinations, were capable of understanding the grouping of symptoms relating to contagious diseases, and identified several diseases including pinta and leishmaniasis. The medicine men of ancient Maya society provided many services to their communities and were held in high regard. Known for their extensive knowledge and spirituality, medicine men were called upon for many reasons, but most often for their healing capabilities. These Maya doctors often employed specialists for specific healing techniques such as bone-setting and childbirth, similar to the method of modern doctors. Bone setting was done by a designated bone-binder, or kax-bac. In addition to his duties as a doctor and sorcerer, a medicine man not only cured diseases, but also sporadically accepted compensation to cause them. The ah-man was also called ah-pul-yaah, the ‚Äúdisease thrower‚Äù.Roys, 23 New evidence indicates dental modification, widely established as an aesthetic practice, was also practiced for medical purposes; skeletal remains recovered at the Piedras Negras S-Sector site indicated dental extractions on teeth affected by caries among other methods of dental modification. Dental surgeons made jade and turquoise prostheses and filled teeth with iron pyrite for practical use past the well-documented aesthetic use of dental inlays for status display. Surgical practices included wound suturing with human hair and fish bones and fracture reduction. Although a large number of Mesoamerican civilizations around the Classic period practiced trepanation with great dexterity and success, such as the Zapotec in Oaxaca, little evidence of drilling trepanation is found in the Maya region outside of skull impressions surmised to have more to do with cranioplasty than medical relief. thumb Ritual practices Maya rituals differ from region to region, but many similar patterns in ceremonies, whether being performed for individual or group need, have been noted. First, all rituals are preceded by foresight of a medicine man, who determines the day of the ceremony through calendrical divination. The medicine men of the Ixil Maya of Guatemala, who kept track of days in their heads, would lay out red seeds from the coral tree onto the pre- Columbian calendar to count them and figure out what day best suited the specific ritual.Colby, 86 As a symbol of a spiritual purification, the individual or individuals would observe a fasting and abstinence period before the ritual day. Consistent patterns are shown throughout the Maya world as to the happenings of the day of the ritual as well. During the ceremony, elements including expulsion of the evil spirit from the participant, incensing of the idols, prayers, offerings, and sacrifices were all practiced. If the ritual was used to cure a disease, the offering may be in the form of food or ornaments, and sacrifice in the form of human bloodletting.Sharer 748 Following the ceremony would be dancing, feasting, and ritual drinking by all, characterized by the Spaniards as a general drunkenness. Today the Maya keep many of the ritualistic traditions of their ancestors. Elements of prayer, offerings, blood sacrifice (replacing human blood with that of sacrificed chickens), burning of copal incense, dancing, and ritual drinking continue in traditional ceremonies. It is noted that even ritualistic practice can have real effects on neurotransmitters and immunological functioning.Colby, 101 Sweat baths An important purification element to the ancient Maya was the sweat bath, temezcal. Similar to a modern-day sauna, sweat baths were constructed of stone walls and ceilings, with a small opening in the top of the ceiling. Water poured onto the hot rocks in the room created steam, offering a setting in which to sweat out impurities. Sweat baths were used for a range of conditions and situations. New mothers who had recently conceived a child would seek revitalization in them, while individuals who were sick could find healing power in sweating. Maya rulers made a habit out of visiting the sweat baths as well because it left them feeling refreshed and, as they believed, cleaner. In addition, Maya rulers performed ritual purification ceremonies to appease the gods and secure the well-being of their communities.Benjamin, 2 It is hypothesized that kings popularized this method of healing because of their regular use of sweat baths. Archeologists have uncovered sweat baths at sites including Tikal, Aguateca and Nakbe, but the most impressive find to date is in Piedras Negras, a Classic Maya city in Guatemala. In addition to the recognizable palaces, temples and ball courts, archaeologists have uncovered eight stone buildings that served as sweat baths to the Maya royalty. Steambaths are still in use among the contemporary Tzotzil and Tzeltal Maya of highland Chiapas, and are associated with a wide range of medicinal plants and postpartum therapies.Groark 1997, 2005 Plant and herbal medicine The study and observation of plants has been of high importance to the Maya for centuries. However, the study of medicinal plants was limited to the priestly class. Plants and herbal remedies were often used in collaboration with other techniques to cure disease. Knowledge of the effects of certain plants on human beings was often used to prescribe an antidote to a particular ailment, but it is also important to note that medicine men also frequently relied on the color of a plant or other remedy in certain situations. For instance, yellow plants and fruits were used in curing jaundice; red for problems characterized by blood; and burned feathers of red birds in curing yellow fever.Roys, 21. In cases of skin irritation, wounds and headaches, fresh vegetation was often used in the form of plasters applied directly to the skin. Plasters were also rubbed on the skin to shield spirits. Depending on the ailment, plants were boiled and used in herbal drinks and/or baths, eaten raw, snorted, smoked, or inserted into one of the body's orifices. Common plants used for medicine include, but are not limited to, chili peppers, cacao, tobacco, agave, and the pitarilla tree. In addition, animal parts, such as those from the crocodile, insects, fish and birds were combined into the herbal concoctions. In most cases, a mixture of plant and animal product was prepared to cure a specific ailment. Use of mind-altering substances For the most part, mind-altering substances were used in rituals by medicine men to achieve a higher state of consciousness or trance-like state. These substances were used for mental and spiritual health purposes. Flora such as peyote, the morning glory, certain mushrooms, tobacco,Groark 2010 and plants used to make alcoholic substances, were commonly used. The smoking of tobacco mixed with other plants produced a trance-like state. Alcoholic substances were used at rituals and were extremely strong. Hallucinogens were used to communicate with the spirit world. A number of these substances were used not to cure sickness, but instead for pain relief. In addition, as depicted in Maya pottery and carvings, ritual enemas were used for a more rapid absorption and effect of the substance. In contrast to modern culture, these remedies were used to restore balance and harmony to the body. Notes References * Anderson, E.N. (2005) Political Ecology in a Yucatec Maya Community.

He served as Medical Officer to The Queen on her overseas tours for 17 years, from 1976 to 1993. He became known to the accompanying press corps as \\"the Queen's Witch Doctor\\", and the Duke of Edinburgh nicknamed him \\"Hemlock\\". He was appointed an Extra Gentleman Usher in 1993. Blacklock was born in Glasgow. His family were doctors with leanings towards the Royal Navy. Evacuated from his home in the Second World War, he was educated McLaren High School in Callander, and read medicine at Glasgow University. He worked as a junior registrar at Glasgow Royal Infirmary and the Western Infirmary in Glasgow, and then did National Service in the Royal Navy from 1951, serving on board HMS Theseus and HMS Warrior, treating trauma cases. He returned to medicine in 1954, working as a surgical registrar and lecturer in surgery at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, and then at hospitals in Ipswich and London from 1956. He married Marjorie Reid in 1956, and they had one daughter (Fiona) and one son (Neil) together, both of whom became doctors. He rejoined the Royal Navy in 1958 to help fill a shortage of surgeons, and served at Navy hospitals in Chatham, Plymouth, Malta and Haslar in Gosport. At Gosport, he started to specialise in urology, founding a new department. He was appointed the director of surgical research in the Royal Navy in 1974, when he was also appointed OBE. He stood in as Medical Officer to the Queen on a royal visit to Luxembourg in 1976, when the incumbent surgeon fell ill at the last minute, and he continued in that role until 1993. He was always well prepared: the HMY Britannia contained a full operating theatre; aircraft of the Queen's Flight carried emergency medical equipment; and he carried a case containing medical supplies, a resuscitator and a defibrillator; but his services were seldom required. He also co-ordinated with local hospitals, and ensured that food served in host countries was acceptable. In Belize, he approved a local delicacy, the gibnut (a large rodent). He was appointed CVO in 1989, and advanced to KCVO and appointed an Extra Gentleman Usher in 1993, after his last royal tour to Hungary. In 1990, Blacklock was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. After retiring from the Royal Navy in 1978, with the rank of Surgeon Captain, he became professor of urology at Victoria University of Manchester. He was based at the Withington Hospital in south Manchester, where he set up the first NHS lithotriptor unit, using ultrasound to break down kidney stones. He published over 80 academic papers and contributed to numerous textbooks. He gave up his chair in 1992. He died on the afternoon of his 50th wedding anniversary after a fall on a staircase in Portsmouth.

He served a two-year term in the Missouri House of Representatives and then became a perennial candidate, running unsuccessfully for various offices over the course of his life. Early life Weber was born to William and Anna Weber on a farm outside of Eureka, Missouri, into a family of seven children. He graduated from Eureka High School in 1942 and went on to attend the University of Missouri. Prior to his graduation at Missouri, Weber joined the Marine Corps, where he served from 1944 until 1947. After his service, he became a farmer and later a real estate broker and prison guard. Political career Weber served as state representative from District 11 in St. Louis County from 1964‚Äì1966. Weber lost his first race for Missouri House of Representatives in 1962. He won in 1964 with 51% of the vote, narrowly defeating incumbent Republican Robert O. Snyder, but never again won an election. He lost reelection to Eric F. Fink in 1966, and lost again to Fink when he sought a comeback in 1968. In 1970, Weber ran for the Missouri Senate but lost the Democratic primary. In 1972, he lost the primary for his old House seat by just two votes. In 1974, he lost the primary for state Senate, and in 1976 he ran for Governor of Missouri but lost the primary to Joseph P. Teasdale, coming in sixth place with 1.3% of the vote. Following his run for Governor, Weber lost several more Democratic primaries: for state senate in 1978, for Missouri's 8th congressional district in 1980, for state House in 1990, and for U.S. Senate in 1992. He then joined the Reform Party and was that party's nominee for Missouri Auditor in 1998 and then Lieutenant Governor in 2000. Also in 2000, Weber ran for President of the United States. He received 9,173 votes among independent voters in California and 217 votes in the Reform Party primaries. After that, he rejoined the Democratic Party. He was the nominee for the 89th district of the Missouri House of Representatives in 2002, losing to Jack Jackson with 27% of the vote. In 2004, he won the primary for Missouri's 2nd congressional district but lost the general election to incumbent Todd Akin. Weber was also the nominee for that seat in 2006, losing again to Akin. He unsuccessfully ran for state House in 2008 and state Senate in 2010. In 2012, Weber narrowly lost his final race, the Democratic primary for Missouri's 2nd district, to Glenn Koenen. Personal life and death Weber married his wife, Roberta, in 1947; she died in 2001. Together, they had six children and at the time of his death, Weber had six grandchildren and three great grandchildren. Weber was diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma in 2010. Treatment was unsuccessful, and despite being told he had only two months to live in November of that year, he survived for two more years and died November 19, 2012. Weber outlived all but one of his siblings; his brother Bud, who was mayor of Eureka, died in 2016 at age 97. Political positions Weber was anti-abortion and pro-gun, but believed existing gun laws need to be better enforced. He was a strong conservationist and believed clean water is about to become a major economic and conservation issue. His conservative social views made him vulnerable to insurgent campaigns in the Democratic primaries in 2004 and 2006, but he narrowly won the nomination both years. The largely progressive Democratic mainstream in St. Louis County, however, was slow to embrace him as a candidate despite his frequent campaigns for office in the area.

Administration At the same time the Mongols imported Central Asians to serve as administrators in China, the Mongols also sent Han Chinese and Khitans from China to serve as administrators over the Muslim population in Bukhara in Central Asia, using foreigners to curtail the power of the local peoples of both lands. Food in the Mongol Empire During the Mongol Empire there were two different groups of food, \\"red foods\\" and \\"white foods\\" .Charles Bawden. Mongolian-English Dictionary \\"White foods\\" were usually dairy products and were the main food source during the summer. The main part of their diet was \\"airag\\" or fermented mare's milk, a food which is still widely drunk today. The Mongols rarely drank milk fresh, but often used it to create other foods, including cheese and yogurt. \\"Red foods\\" were usually meat and were the main food source during the winter, usually boiled and served with wild garlic or onions. The Mongols had a unique way of slaughtering their animals to get meat. The animal was laid on its back and restrained. Then the butcher would cut its chest open and rip open the aorta, which would cause deadly internal bleeding. Animals would be slaughtered in this fashion because it would keep all of the blood inside of the carcass. Once all of the internal organs were removed, the blood was then drained out and used for sausages.Allsen, Thomas T. Culture and Conquest in Mongol Eurasia. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2001. 128-129 The Mongols also hunted animals as a food source, including rabbit, deer, wild boar, and even wild rodents such as squirrels and marmots. During the winter, the Mongols also practiced ice fishing. The Mongols rarely slaughtered animals during the summer but if an animal died of natural causes they made sure to carefully preserve it. This was done by cutting the meat into strips and then letting it dry by the sun and the wind. During the winter sheep were the only domestic animal slaughtered, but horses were occasionally slaughtered for ceremonies.Amitai-Preiss, Reuven, and David O. Morgan, eds. The Mongol Empire and its Legacy. Leiden: Brill, 1999. 200-222 Meal etiquette existed only during large gatherings and ceremonies. The meal, usually meat, was cut up into small pieces. Guests were served their meat on skewers and the host determined the order of serving. People of different social classes were assigned to different parts of the meat and it was the responsibility of the server or the \\"ba‚Äôurchis\\" to know who was in each social class. The meat was eaten with fingers and the grease was wiped on the ground or on clothing. The most commonly imported fare was liquor. Most popular was Chinese rice wine and Turkestani grape wine. Genghis Khan was first presented grape wine in 1204 but he dismissed it as dangerously strong. Drunkenness was common at festivals and gatherings. Singing and dancing were also common after the consumption of alcohol. Due to Turkestani and Middle Eastern influences, noodles started to appear in Mongol food. Spices such as cardamom and other food such as chickpeas and fenugreek seeds also became part of the diet due to these external influences.Atwood, Christopher P. \\"Daily Food in the Mongol Empire.\\" The Encyclopedia of The Mongols and the Mongol Empire. 1 vols.

Economy of the Mongol Empire Mongol \\"Great Khans\\" coin, minted at Balkh, Afghanistan, AH 618, 1221 CE.  Money  Genghis Khan authorized the use of paper money shortly before his death in 1227. It was backed by precious metals and silk.Weatherford, pp. 175-176 The Mongols used Chinese silver ingot as a unified money of public account, while circulating paper money in China and coins in the western areas of the empire such as Golden Horde and Chagatai Khanate. Under √ñgedei Khan the Mongol government issued paper currency backed by silk reserves and founded a Department which was responsible for destroying old notes.A.P. Martinez, The use of Mint-output data in Historical research on the Western appanages, p.87-100 In 1253, M√∂ngke established a Department of Monetary affairs to control the issuance of paper money in order to eliminate the overissue of the currency by Mongol and non-Mongol nobles since the reign of Great Khan √ñgedei. His authority established united measure based on sukhe or silver ingot, however, the Mongols allowed their foreign subjects to mint coins in the denominations and use weight they traditionally used. During the reigns of √ñgedei, G√ºy√ºk and M√∂ngke, Mongol coinage increased with gold and silver coinage in Central Asia and copper and silver coins in Caucasus, Iran and southern Russia.Atwood, Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, p. 362 The Yuan dynasty under Kublai Khan issued paper money backed by silver, and again banknotes supplemented by cash and copper cash. Marco Polo wrote that the money was made of mulberry bark. The standardization of paper currency allowed the Yuan court to monetize taxes and reduce carrying costs of taxes in goods as did the policy of M√∂ngke Khan. But the forest nations of Siberia and Manchuria still paid their taxes in goods or commodities to the Mongols.The history of Yuan dynasty and Spuler Golden Horde Jiaochao was used only within the Yuan dynasty, and even Ilkhan Rinchindorj Gaykhatu, who was supportive of the Yuan leadership in other ways, failed to adopt the monetary experiment in his Middle East realm in 1294. As did the khanates of the Golden Horde and Chagatai Khanate, the Ilkhanate minted their own coins in gold, silver and copper.Bruce G.

Mongol government and elites invested in commercial enterprises using metal coins, paper money, gold and silver ingots and tradable wares for partnership investments and primarily financed money-lending and trade activities.Enerelt Enkhbold, 2019. \\"The role of the ortoq in the Mongol Empire in forming business partnerships\\", Central Asian Survey 38 (4), 1-17 A paper money investment was not possible in the western Mongol empire.  Trade routes  The Mongols had a strong history of supporting merchants and trade. Genghis Khan had encouraged foreign merchants early in his career, even before uniting the Mongols. Merchants provided him with information about neighboring cultures, served as diplomats and official traders for the Mongols, and were essential for many needed goods, since the Mongols produced little of their own. Mongols sometimes provided capital for merchants, and sent them far afield, in an ortoq (merchant partner) arrangement. As the Empire grew, any merchants or ambassadors with proper documentation and authorization, received protection and sanctuary as they traveled through Mongol realms. Well-traveled and relatively well-maintained roads linked lands from the Mediterranean basin to China, and greatly increasing overland trade, and resulting in some dramatic stories of those who traveled what became known as the Silk Road. One of the best-known travelers from West to East was Marco Polo, and a comparable journey from East to West was that of the Chinese Mongol monk Rabban Bar Sauma, who traveled from his home of Khanbaliq (Beijing) as far as Europe. Missionaries such as William of Rubruck also traveled to the Mongol court, on missions of conversion, or as papal envoys, carrying correspondence between the Pope and the Mongols as attempts were made to form a Franco-Mongol alliance. It was rare though for anyone to travel the entire length of the Silk Road. Instead, traders moved products much like a bucket brigade, with luxury goods being traded from one middleman to another, from China to the West, and resulting in extravagant prices for the trade goods. After Genghis, the merchant partner business continued to flourish under his successors √ñgedei and G√ºy√ºk. Merchants brought clothing, food, and other provisions to the imperial palaces, and in return the Great Khans gave the merchants tax exemptions, and allowed them to use the official relay stations of the Mongol Empire. Merchants also served as tax farmers in China, Russia and Iran. If the merchants were attacked by bandits, losses were made up from the imperial treasury. Policies changed under the Great Khan M√∂ngke. Because of money laundering and overtaxing, he attempted to limit abuses and sent imperial investigators to supervise the ortoq businesses. He decreed all merchants must pay commercial and property taxes, and he paid off all drafts drawn by high- ranking Mongol elites from the merchants. This policy continued in the Yuan dynasty. M√∂ngke-Tem√ºr granted the Genoese and the Venetians exclusive rights to hold Caffa and Azov in 1267. The Golden Horde permitted German merchants to trade in all of its territories including Russian principalities in the 1270s. The Mongols developed the concepts of liability in relation to investments and loans in Mongol‚Äìortoq partnerships, promoting trade and investment to facilitate the commercial integration of the Mongol Empire. In Mongol times, the contractual features of a Mongol-ortoq partnership closely resembled that of qirad and commenda arrangements. The fall of the Mongol Empire led to the collapse of the political unity along the Silk Road. Also falling victim were the cultural and economic aspects of its unity. Turkic tribes seized the western end of the Silk Road from the decaying Byzantine Empire, and sowed the seeds of a Turkic culture that would later crystallize into the Ottoman Empire under the Sunni faith. Turkic-Mongol military bands in Iran, after some years of chaos were united under the Saffavid tribe, under whom the modern Iranian nation took shape under the Shiite faith. Meanwhile, Mongol princes in Central Asia were content with Sunni orthodoxy with decentralized princedoms of the Chagatai, Timurid and Uzbek houses. In the Kypchak-Tatar zone, Mongol khanates all but crumbled under the assaults of the Black Death and the rising power of Muscovy. In the East, the native Chinese overthrew the Yuan dynasty in 1368, launching their own Ming dynasty and pursuing a policy of economic isolationism.Guoli Liu-Chinese foreign policy in transition, p.364 The introduction of gunpowder contributed to the fall of the Mongols, as previously conquered tribes used it to reassert their independence. Gunpowder had differing effects depending on the region. In Europe, gunpowder and early modernity lent to the integration of territorial states and increasing mercantilism. Along the Silk Road, it was quite the opposite: failure to maintain the level of integration of the Mongol Empire, and a resulting decline in trade, partially exacerbated by the increase in European maritime trade. By 1400, the Silk Road no longer served as a shipping route for silk. Marco Polo's observations Archbishop John of Cilician Armenia, in a painting from 1287. His dress displays a Chinese dragon, an indication of the thriving exchanges with the Mongol Empire during the reign of Kublai Khan (1260-1294) One of the most impressive discoveries that Marco Polo made on his visit to Mongolia is how the empire's monetary system worked. He was not impressed by the silver Ak√ße that the empire used for a unified currency, or that some realms of the empire still used local currency, but he was most surprised by the fact that in some parts of the empire the people used paper currency.Allsen, Thomas T. Culture and Conquest in Mongol Eurasia. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2001. 177-179. Marco Polo considered the use of paper currency in the Mongol Empire one of the marvels of the world. Paper currency wasn't used in the entire empire. The Chinese silver ingot was accepted universally as currency throughout the empire, while local coins were also used in some western areas, such as the modern day Iran. Paper currency was used in China, continuing the practice established by the Chinese several hundred years before. The Chinese had mastered the technology of printmaking and therefore it was relatively simple for them to print bills. Paper currency was used in China since 960 A.D., when the Song dynasty started replacing their copper coinage with paper currency. When the Mongols invaded Song China they started issuing their own Mongolian bills in 1227. This first attempt by the Mongols did not last long because the notes issued expired after several years and were inconsistent throughout the parts of the Mongol Empire that issued them. In 1260, Kublai Khan created the Yuan Mongol's first unified paper currency with notes that did not have any expiration date. To validate the currency, it was made fully exchangeable to silver and gold and was accepted as tax payments. Currency distribution was small at first, but the war against the southern Song dramatically increased circulation. With the defeat of the Song, their currency was taken out of circulation and could be exchanged with Mongol currency at a relatively high exchange rate. Regardless of persistent inflation after 1272, paper currency backed by limited releases of coins remained as the standard means of currency until 1345. Around 1345, rebellions, economic crisis, and financial mismanagement of paper currency destroyed the public's confidence in the bills.Amitai-Preiss, Reuven, and David O. Morgan, eds. The Mongol Empire and Its Legacy. Leiden: Brill, 1999. 200-222. To initiate the transition from other forms of compensation to paper currency the government made refusing to accept the bill punishable by death. To avoid devaluation, the penalty for forging or counterfeiting was also death.Atwood, Christopher P. \\"Paper Currency in the Mongol Empire.\\" The Encyclopedia of The Mongols and the Mongol Empire. 1 vols. New York: Facts on File, 2004.Atwood, Christopher P. \\"Money in the Mongol Empire.\\" The Encyclopedia of The Mongols and the Mongol Empire. 1 vols. New York: Facts on File, 2004.. Appanage system Members of the Golden Kin (or Golden Family - Altan urag) were entitled to a share (khubi - —Ö—É–≤—å) of the benefits of each part of the Mongol Empire just as each Mongol noble and their family, as well as each warrior, was entitled to an appropriate measure of all the goods seized in war. In 1206, Genghis Khan gave large lands with people as share to his family and loyal companions, of whom most were people of common origin. Shares of booty were distributed much more widely. Empresses, princesses and meritorious servants, as well as children of concubines, all received full shares including war prisoners.Weatherford, pp. 220-227 For example, Kublai called 2 siege engineers from the Ilkhanate in Middle East, then under the rule of his nephew Abaqa. After the Mongol conquest in 1238, the port cities in Crimea paid the Jochids custom duties and the revenues were divided among all Chingisid princes in Mongol Empire accordance with the appanage system.Jackson, \\"Dissolution of Mongol Empire\\", pp. 186-243 As loyal allies, the Kublaids in East Asia and the Ilkahnids in Persia sent clerics, doctors, artisans, scholars, engineers and administrators to and received revenues from the appanages in each other's khanates. After Genghis Khan (1206‚Äì1227) distributed nomadic grounds and cities in Mongolia and North China to his mother Hoelun, youngest brother Tem√ºge and other members and Chinese districts in Manchuria to his other brothers, √ñgedei distributed shares in North China, Khorazm, Transoxiana to the Golden Family, imperial sons in law (khurgen- —Ö“Ø—Ä–≥—ç–Ω) and notable generals in 1232-1236. Great Khan M√∂ngke divided up shares or appanages in Persia and made redistribution in Central Asia in 1251-1256.Grousset, Empire of the Steppes, p. 286 Although Chagatai Khanate was the smallest in its size, Chagatai Khans owned Kat and Khiva towns in Khorazm, few cities and villages in Shanxi and Iran in spite of their nomadic grounds in Central Asia. First Ilkhan Hulagu owned 25,000 households of silk- workers in China, valleys in Tibet as well as pastures, animals, men in Mongolia. His descendant Ghazan of Persia sent envoys with precious gifts to Tem√ºr Khan of Yuan dynasty to request his great-grandfather's shares in Great Yuan in 1298. It is claimed that Ghazan received his shares that were not sent since the time of M√∂ngke Khan.Jackson, Peter, \\"from Ulus to Khanate: The making of Mongol States, c. 1220-1290\\" in Amitai-Preiss, Reuven, The Mongol Empire and its legacy (2000), p.p. 12-38, Mongol and non-Mongol appanage holders demanded excessive revenues and freed themselves from taxes. √ñgedei decreed that nobles could appoint darughachi and judges in the appanages instead direct distribution without the permission of Great Khan thanks to genius Khitan minister Yelu Chucai. Kublai Khan continued √ñgedei's regulations somehow, however, both G√ºy√ºk and M√∂ngke restricted the autonomy of the appanages before. Ghazan also prohibited any misfeasance of appanage holders in Ilkhanate and Yuan councillor Temuder restricted Mongol nobles' excessive rights on the appanages in China and Mongolia.Cambridge History of China Kublai's successor and Khagan Tem√ºr abolished imperial son-in-law Goryeo King Chungnyeol's 358 departments which caused financial pressures to the Korean people,Chongson, The history of Gaoli whose country was under the control of the Mongols.Herbert Franke, Denis Twitchett, The Cambridge History of China: Volume 6, \\"Alien Regimes and Border States\\", p.436Morgan, The Mongols, p. 120Jae-un Kang, Suzanne Lee, The land of scholars: two thousand years of Korean ConfucianismHy≈èng-sik Sin, A Brief history of Korea The appanage system was severely affected beginning with the civil strife in the Mongol Empire in 1260-1304.Atwood, p. 32 Nevertheless, this system survived. For example, Abaqa of the Ilkhanate allowed M√∂ngke Tem√ºr of the Golden Horde to collect revenues from silk workshops in northern Persia in 1270 and Baraq of the Chagatai Khanate sent his Muslim vizier to Ilkhanate, ostensibly to investigate his appanages there (The vizier's main mission was to spy on the Ilkhanids in fact) in 1269.A COMPENDIUM OF CHRONICLES: Rashid al-Din's Illustrated History of the World (The Nasser D.

After a peace treaty declared among Mongol Khans: Tem√ºr, Duwa, Chapar, Tokhta and Oljeitu in 1304, the system began to see a recovery. During the reign of Tugh Tem√ºr, Yuan court received a third of revenues of the cities of Transoxiana under Chagatai Khans while Chagatai elites such as Eljigidey, Duwa Tem√ºr, Tarmashirin were given lavish presents and sharing in the Yuan dynasty's patronage of Buddhist temples.W.

By 1339, Ozbeg and his successors had received annually 24 thousand ding in paper currency from their Chinese appanages in Shanxi, Cheli and Hunan.Thomas T. Allsen, Sharing out the Empire 172-190 H. H. Howorth noted that Ozbeg's envoy required his master's shares from the Yuan court, the headquarters of the Mongol world, for the establishment of new post stations in 1336.Howorth, p. 172 This communication ceased only with the breakup, succession struggles and rebellions of Mongol Khanates.Ilkhanate broke up in 1335; the succession struggles of the Golden Horde and the Chagatai Khanate started in 1359 and 1340 respectively; the Yuan army fought against the Red Turban Rebellion since the 1350s. Domestic animals in the Mongol Empire \\"Hunting Wild Geese\\" (Â∞ÑÈõÅÂúñ), Hanging scroll with ink and colors, by Anonymous, Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). This painting depicts a hunting party on a path surrounded by mountains. The leader of the party appears to be Tem√ºr Khan. The Yuan emperors enjoyed hunting and ordered artists to do related paintings on many occasions to record their trips. The five domestic animals most important in the Mongol Empire were horses (most important), cattle, camels, sheep, and goats. All of these animals were valued for their milk and all of the animals‚Äô hides were used for clothing and shelter. Though often considered unattractive by other cultures, Mongolian domestic animals were well adapted to cold weather as well as shortages of food and water. These animals were and still are known to survive under these conditions while animals from other regions perish. Horses Horses were by far the most important animal to the ancient Mongols. Not only were they fairly self-sufficient, but they were hardy and fast. Smaller than most, these animals could travel long distances without fatigue. They were also well adapted to the harsh winters and dug through the snow looking for grass to feed off of. Almost every family possessed at least one horse, and in some cases, horses were buried with their owners to serve with them in the next life. Mongolian horses were probably the most important factor of the Mongol Empire. Without the extremely skilled, not to mention famous, cavalry, the Mongols would not have been able to raid and capture the huge area they did and the Mongols would not be known, even today, as skilled horsemen. It also served as an animal that Mongols could drink blood from, by cutting into a vein in the neck and drinking it, especially on harsh, long rides from place to place. For additional sustenance, horse mare's milk was made into an alcoholic beverage, known as airag. Horses allowed the Mongols to travel over twenty kilometers (13 miles) per hour which was great for ancient times.Atwood, Christopher P. \\"Cattle\\". The Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire. 1 vol. New York: Facts on File, 2004. Cattle Cattle were used mainly as beasts of burden but they were also valued for their milk, though not as much so for their meat. They lived on the open range and were fairly easy to maintain. They were released early in the morning to graze without a herder or overseer and wandered back on their own in the afternoon. Though they were a part of the domestic animal population, they were not that common in the early empire. In the early time period, only nine percent of all domestic animals were cattle.Polo, Marco. The Travels. Ed. Ronald Latham London: Penguin Books, 1598. Camels Kalmucks and Mongols riding camels over the Great Steppe Camels, along with cattle, were also used as beasts of burden. As they were domesticated (between 4000-3000 BC), they became one of the most important animals for land based trade in Asia. The reasons for this were that they did not require roads to travel on, they could carry up to 500 pounds of goods and supplies, and they did not require much water for long journeys. Besides being beasts of burden, camels‚Äô hair was used as a main fiber in Mongolian textiles. Sheep/goats Sheep and goats were most valued for their milk, meat, and wool. The wool of sheep in particular was very valuable. The shearing was usually done in the spring before the herds were moved to mountain pastures. Most importantly, it was used for making felt to insulate Mongolian homes, called gers, however it was also used for rugs, saddle blankets, and clothing. Ideal herd numbers were usually about 1000. To reach this quota, groups of people would combine their herds and travel together with their sheep and goats.Atwood, Christopher P. \\"Sheep\\". The Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire. 1 vol. New York: Facts on File, 2004. Traditional Mongolian clothing Clothing of the Mongol nobles. During the Mongol Empire, there was a uniform type of Mongol dress though variations according to wealth, status, and gender did occur. These differences included the design, colour, cut, and elaborateness of the outfit. The first layer consisted of a long, ankle length robe called a caftan. Some caftans had a square collar but the majority overlapped in the front to fasten under the arm creating a slanting collar. The skirt of the caftan was sewn on separately, and sometimes ruffles were added depending on the purpose and class of the person wearing it. Men and unmarried women tied their caftans with two belts, one thin, leather one beneath a large, broad sash that covered the stomach. Once a woman became married, she stopped wearing the sash. Instead she wore a very full caftan and some had a short-sleeved jacket that opened in the front. For women of higher rank, the overlapping collar of their caftan was decorated with elaborate brocade and they wore full sleeves and a train that servants had to carry. For both genders, trousers were worn under the caftan probably because of the nomadic traditions of the Mongol people. The materials used to create caftans varied according to status and wealth. They ranged anywhere from silk, brocade, cotton, and valuable furs for richer groups, to leather, wool, and felt for those less well off. Season also dictated the type of fabric worn, especially for those that could afford it. In the summer, Middle Eastern silk and brocades were favored whereas in the winter furs were used to add additional warmth. Color was an important characteristic of clothing because it had symbolic meaning. During large festivities held by the Khan, he would give his important diplomats special robes to wear with specific colors according to what was being celebrated. These were worn only during the specific festival, and if one was caught wearing it at other times, punishments were extremely severe, as were the rules during the time of Khubilai Khan. The footwear of the traditional Mongol Empire consisted mainly of boots or leather sandals made out of cow fur. This footwear was thick and often smelled of cow dung. Both the left foot and the right foot were identical and they were made of leather, cotton, or silk. Many layers were sewn together to create the sole of the boot then separately made uppers were attached. The upper sections of the boots were usually dark in colour and the soles were light. Light strips of fabric were sewn over the seams to make them more durable. Boots usually had a pointed or upturned toe but lacked a heel.Allsen, Thomas T.

New York: Facts on File, 2004. Tools of warfare From 1206 to 1405 the Mongol Empire displayed their military strength by conquering land between the Yellow Sea and the Eastern European border. This would not have been possible without their specialized horses, bows and arrows, and swords. They conquered numerous neighboring territories, which eventually led to history's largest contiguous land-based empire. The Mongol Empire utilized the swiftness and strength of the horses to their advantage. Despite being only 12 to 13 hands high, the Mongols respected these small animals. At a young age, boys trained with the horses by hunting and herding with them. Eventually they became experienced riders, which prepared them for the military life that awaited them when they turned fifteen years old. Once these boys became soldiers, four to seven horses were given to them to alternate between. This large number of horses ensured that some were always rested and ready to fight. Because of this, a soldier had little excuse to fall behind in his tasks. Overall, the Mongol society adored these animals because of their gentleness and loyalty to their masters. Anyone who abused or neglected to feed these horses properly was subjected to punishment by the government. The Mongol Empire considered horses as an important factor to its success and tailored other weapons to them. The bow and arrow was created to be light enough to attack enemies while on horseback. The Mongols used composite bows made from birch, sinew and the horns of sheep. This made sturdy but light bows. Three types of arrows were created for different purposes. The most common arrow used for warfare was the pointed iron head, which could travel as far as 200 metres. If a soldier wanted to slice the flesh of the opposing member, the v-shaped point was used. In times of war, soldiers would shoot the third form of arrow with holes, used for signalling. By listening to the whistling sounds that were produced by this type of arrow, soldiers were able to march in a required direction. Soldiers primarily used horses and the bow and arrow in times of war, but the military took extra precautions. They prepared for any close range combat by supplying the soldiers with swords, axes, spears, and forks. Halberds were given to those of wealth and the remaining members of the military carried clubs or maces. Along with these necessities, the military provided their soldiers with leather sacks and files. The leather sacks were used to carry and keep items such as weapons dry. They also could be inflated and used as floats during river crossings. The files were for sharpening the arrows. Any soldier found missing his weapons would be punished. Methods of punishment included whippings, doing very hard physical activities, or possibly having to leave the army. Even though the military of the Mongol Empire provided weapons for every soldier, armor was available only to the wealthier soldiers. These individuals wore iron chains or scales, protected their arms and legs with leather strips, wore iron helmets, and used iron shields. The horses of the more well-to-do were also protected to their knees with iron armor and a head plate. The majority of the soldiers in the Mongol Empire were poor. Therefore, many walked into battle with minimal protection, although all of the soldiers had very little armor compared to the knights in armor of Europe.Atwood, Christopher P. \\"The Soldiers:Weaponry, Training, Rewards.\\" The Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire. 1 vol.

London: Thames and Hudson, 1969. Kinship and family life The traditional Mongol family was patriarchal, patrilineal and patrilocal. Wives were brought for each of the sons, while daughters were married off to other clans. Wife-taking clans stood in a relation of inferiority to wife-giving clans. Thus wife-giving clans were considered \\"elder\\" or \\"bigger\\" in relation to wife-taking clans, who were considered \\"younger\\" or \\"smaller\\".Vreeland 1962:160Aberle 1953:23-24 This distinction, symbolized in terms of \\"elder\\" and \\"younger\\" or \\"bigger\\" and \\"smaller\\", was carried into the clan and family as well, and all members of a lineage were terminologically distinguished by generation and age, with senior superior to junior. In the traditional Mongolian family, each son received a part of the family herd as he married, with the elder son receiving more than the younger son. The youngest son would remain in the parental tent caring for his parents, and after their death he would inherit the parental tent in addition to his own part of the herd. This inheritance system was mandated by law codes such as the Yassa, created by Genghis Khan. Likewise, each son inherited a part of the family's camping lands and pastures, with the elder son receiving more than the younger son. The eldest son inherited the farthest camping lands and pastures, and each son in turn inherited camping lands and pastures closer to the family tent until the youngest son inherited the camping lands and pastures immediately surrounding the family tent. Family units would often remain near each other and in close cooperation, though extended families would inevitably break up after a few generations. It is probable that the Yasa simply put into written law the principles of customary law. Nilg√ºn Dalkesen wrote in Gender Roles and Women's Status in Central Asia and Anatolia between the Thirteenth and Sixteenth Centuries: \\"It is apparent that in many cases, for example in family instructions, the yasa tacitly accepted the principles of customary law and avoided any interference with them. For example, Riasanovsky said that killing the man or the woman in case of adultery is a good illustration. Yasa permitted the institutions of polygamy and concubinage so characteristic of southerly nomadic peoples. Children born of concubines were legitimate. Seniority of children derived their status from their mother. Eldest son received more than the youngest after the death of father. But the latter inherited the household of the father. Children of concubines also received a share in the inheritance, in accordance with the instructions of their father (or with custom)\\" After the family, the next largest social units were the subclan and clan. These units were derived from groups claiming patrilineal descent from a common ancestor, ranked in order of seniority (the \\"conical clan\\"). By the Chingissid era this ranking was symbolically expressed at formal feasts, in which tribal chieftains were seated and received particular portions of the slaughtered animal according to their status. The lineage structure of Central Asia had three different modes. It was organized on the basis of genealogical distance, or the proximity of individuals to one another on a graph of kinship; generational distance, or the rank of generation in relation to a common ancestor, and birth order, the rank of brothers in relation to each another.Cuisenier (1975:67) The paternal descent lines were collaterally ranked according to the birth of their founders, and were thus considered senior and junior to each other. Of the various collateral patrilines, the senior in order of descent from the founding ancestor, the line of eldest sons, was the most noble. In the steppe, no one had his exact equal; everyone found his place in a system of collaterally ranked lines of descent from a common ancestor.Krader (1963:322, 269) It was according to this idiom of superiority and inferiority of lineages derived from birth order that legal claims to superior rank were couched. Mongol kinship is one of a particular patrilineal type classed as Omaha kinship, in which relatives are grouped together under separate terms that crosscut generations, age, and even sexual difference. Thus, a man's father's sister's children, his sister's children, and his daughter's children are all called by another term. A further attribute is strict terminological differentiation of siblings according to seniority. The division of Mongolian society into senior elite lineages and subordinate junior lineages was waning by the nineteenth century. During the 1920s the Communist regime was established. The remnants of the Mongolian aristocracy fought alongside the Japanese and against Chinese, Soviets and Communist Mongolians during World War II, but were defeated. There are some people today, though, who claim descent from the Mongol aristocracy. The anthropologist Herbert Harold Vreeland visited three Mongol communities in 1920 and published a highly detailed book with the results of his field work, \\"Mongol community and kinship structure\\", now publicly available. Women of the Mongol Empire Arghun's wife was Buluqhan Khatun, who gave birth to Ghazan (here being breastfed). Rashid al-Din, early 14th century. Compared to other civilizations, Mongolian women had the power to influence society and enjoyed much more freedom in general. Even though men were dominant in society, many turned to women in their lives for advice. While developing organizations within the Mongol Empire, Genghis Khan asked for assistance from his mother. He honored the advice women in his life offered. Genghis Khan permitted his wives to sit with him and encouraged them to voice their opinions. Because of their help, Genghis was able to choose his successor. Furthermore Mongol women were riding horseback, they fought in battles, tended their herds and influenced their men on important decisions for the Mongolian Empire. The Mongols considered marriage as . Before a marriage could proceed, the bride's family was required to offer \\"a dowry of clothing or household ornaments\\" to the groom's mother. To avoid paying the dowry, families could exchange daughters or the groom could work for his future father-in-law. Once the dowry was settled, the bride's family presented her with an inheritance of livestock or servants. Typically, married women of the Mongol Empire wore headdresses to distinguish themselves from the unmarried women. It is claimed that the Yassa/Zasag prohibited trade in women. Marriages in the Mongol Empire were arranged, however Genghis Khan's later nokoger (literally \\"women friends\\" but seen as wives usually and later) and those of his officers were not ever paid for with any bride price, but men were permitted to practice polygamy. Since each wife had their own yurt, the husband had the opportunity to choose where he wanted to sleep each night. Visitors to this region found it remarkable that marital complications did not arise. The location of the yurts between the wives differed depending on who married first. The first wife placed her yurt to the east and the other wives placed their yurts to the west. Even though a husband remained attached to his first wife, the women were \\"docile, diligent, and lacked jealousy\\" towards one another. After the husband had slept with one of his wives, the others congregated in her yurt to share drinks with the couple. The wives of the Mongol Empire were not bothered by the presence of the other women in their household. As a married woman, she displayed her \\"maturity and independence from her father\\" to society. The women devoted their lives to their daily tasks, which included physical work outside the household. Women worked by loading the yurts, herding and milking all the livestock, and making felt for the yurt. Along with these chores, they were expected to cook and sew for their husband, their children, and their elders. A wife's devotion to her husband continued after his death. Remarriages during the Mongol Empire did not occur often. Instead, her youngest son or her youngest brother took care of her. However Genghis Khan had allowed remarriage of widows including the levirate. Atwood, Christopher P. \\"The Mongol Empire.\\" The Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire. 1 vol. New York: Facts on File, 2004. Polo, Marco. The Travels. Ed. Ronald Latham London: Penguin Books, 1958 Mongol women enjoyed more freedoms than those in their foreign vassal countries. They refused to adopt the Chinese practice of footbinding and wear chadors or burqas. The Mongolian women were allowed to move about more freely in public. Toward the end of the Mongol Empire, however, the increasing influence of Neo-Confucianism, Buddhism and Islamicization saw greater limits placed on Mongol women.Peggy Martin AP World History, p.133 Mongol dwellings A reconstruction of an ancient Mongol tribe, located near the Genghis Khan Equestrian Statue Ger-tereg on the move Basket and fork for gathering the dung (used as fuel in the yurts), S√ºkhbaatar Aimag, Mongolia, 1972 Mongols have been living in virtually the same dwellings since at least the 6th century AD. These dwellings are called gers, and during the Mongol Empire they consisted of a round, collapsible wooden frame covered in felt. The roof was formed from about 80 wooden rods attached at one end to the wall frame and at the other to an iron ring in the center, providing a sturdy base for the felt roof. Without the roof in place, this frame would have resembled a large wooden wheel with the wooden spokes converging at the iron ring. The top of the roof was usually about five feet higher than the walls so precipitation would run to the ground. The ring at the peak of the yurt could be left open as a vent for smoke and a window for sunlight, or it could be closed with a piece of felt. Doors were made from a felt flap or, for richer families, out of wood. The Turkish word for ger, \\"yurt\\", means \\"homeland\\" in Turkish and it was probably never used to describe the tent. When the dwelling made its way to Mongolia, it adopted the name \\"ger\\" which means \\"home\\" in Mongolian. They were always set up with the door facing the south and tended to have an altar across from the door whether the inhabitant were Buddhist or shamanist. The floors were dirt, but richer families were able to cover the floors with felt rugs. Sometimes beds were used, but most people slept on the floor between hides, around the fire pit that was in the center of the dwelling. The first known yurt was seen engraved on a bronze bowl that was found in the Zagros Mountains of southern Iran, dating back to 600 BC, but the felt tent probably did not arrive in Mongolia for another thousand years. When the yurt did arrive, however, it quickly came into widespread use because of its ability to act in concert with the nomadic lifestyle of the Mongols. Most of the Mongol people were herders and moved constantly from southern regions in the winter months to the northern steppes in summer as well as moving periodically to fresh pastures. The yurts' size and the felt walls made them relatively cool in the summers and warm in the winters allowing the Mongols to live in the same dwelling year-round. Disassembling the yurts only took about an hour, as did putting them back up in a new location. This is why there are still some doubts today about the assumption that the yurts have ever been really put on carts pulled by oxen for transporting them from camp to camp, without disassembling them, or if these carts are just a legend. Some travelers, like Marco Polo, did mention them in their writings: \\"They [the Mongols] have circular houses made of wood and covered with felt, which they carry about with them on four wheeled wagons wherever they go. For the framework of rods is so neatly constructed that it is light to carry.\\" (Polo, 97) Yurts could be heated with dried dung, found in abundance with the traveling herds, so no timber was needed.\\"Glossary ... Argal -- camel droppings, used as fuel\\".--Fritz M√ºhlenweg (1954) Big Tiger and Christian. London: Jonathan Cape; p. 14 The felt for the covering was made from wool that was taken from sheep also present in most Mongol herds. The wooden frame was handed down from one generation to the next and seldom had to be replaced. Today, yurts follow the same basic design though they are usually covered in canvas, use an iron stove and stovepipe, and use a collapsible lattice work frame for the walls. They are still used in parts of rural China, central Mongolia, and by the Kyrgyz of Kyrgyzstan.Atwood, Christopher P. Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire.

Once children turned five or six they were expected to contribute to the family and community. They were treated as young adults and received more responsibilities as they grew older.  Adolescents  Young girls were expected to perform household duties, while young boys were to help their fathers in farming. Mostly women raised the children, but \\"When a boy was about four or five his father began the training of his son.\\"Sharer, 482 When adolescents turned 15, they were expected to be independent. Today, this tradition of work ethic still applies to adolescents. Children in the Mayan Culture was most likely already have their life planned out already. The females would be taught by their mothers everything there could be to learn and the same for the males, the father would teach their sons the \\"job\\" the father would be in. In the Mayan culture it was to believed that the kids are always being taught survival skills and the ways of their culture.  Rituals and children  The Maya desired some unnatural physical characteristics for their children. For instance, at a very young age boards were pressed on babies' foreheads to create a flattened surface. This process was widespread among the upper class. Another practice was to cross babies' eyes. To do this, objects were dangled in front of a newborn's eyes, until the newborn's eyes were completely and permanently crossed. In addition, there were a few unique customs regarding children. For example, most Maya children were named according to the day they were born. Every day of the year had a specific name for both boys and girls and parents were expected to follow that practice.  Death  Most burial sites for children were not as elaborate as adult burial sites. \\"Infants/toddlers generally lacked offerings‚Ä¶ for [children] who died before reaching the age of five, the only elaboration or special treatment consisted of inclusion within a probable family group‚Ä¶\\"Ardren, 67 However, some burial sites for children did contain more gifts than other youngsters. This suggests that the family had a great deal of remorse, and/or the child had high standings.  Values in children  Several values were stressed to Maya children. Not only was a strong work ethics desirable, but working for the betterment of the community was necessary. Families were extremely important to the Maya culture, and respecting the leaders in one's family was imperative. \\"A sense of responsibility is another important quality which children have to learn. This includes independence, self-confidence and the ability to make decisions.\\"Heckt, 325 It is believed that the most important quality for children to have was common sense, and they received this by shadowing their parents. Among Yucatec Maya parents, the ceremony called hetsmek is still practiced even among professionals living in M√©rida, the capital of Yucat√°n.  Maya children today  Maya populations are present today in many areas of Central and South America, such as Guatemala. There is limited research on the lives of Maya children, mostly because developmental research has primarily involved European-American children.Morelli, G., Rogoff, B., & Angelillo, C. (2003). Cultural variation in young children's access to work or involvement in specialized child-focused activities. International Journal of Behavioural Development, 27, 264-274. However, it is evident that the goals for Maya children's socialization and daily activities differ from those of other cultures, especially those that are most studied.Gaskins, S. (2006) The Cultural Organization of Yucatec Mayan Children√≠s Social Interactions. Peer relationships in cultural context, 283.  Learning  Children in many Maya communities often engage in different socialization patterns than those commonly found in European-American communities. Specifically, Maya cultures commonly emphasize the primacy of community activities (in which adults and children are participants), the importance of parental beliefs, and the independence of children's motivation in their socialization.Gaskins, S. (1999). Children's Daily Lives in a Mayan village: A Case Study of Culturally Constructed Roles and Activities. In A. G√∂nc√º (Ed.), Children's Engagement in the World: Sociocultural Perspectives (pp. 25-61). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University PressGaskins, S. (2000). Children's Daily Activities in a Mayan Village: A Culturally Grounded Description. Cross-Cultural Research, 34, 375-389. Children in Maya communities develop within the context of work and other family activities. They commonly learn through observing and engaging in work with others. Children in modern-day Maya communities observe and participate in work with people of all ages.Rogoff, B., Morelli, G. A., & Chavajay, P. (2010). Children√≠s Integration in Communities and Segregation From People of Differing Ages. Perspectives on Psychological Science, 5(4), 431-440. Young children in Maya communities such as San Pedro La Laguna have been observed listening in on the work of older children, adults, and elders. These children are expected to observe the activities going on around them in order for their learning to take place. The mix of interaction between age groups in Maya communities is important to their learning. Age segregation does not play an active role in the learning patterns of Maya children, as they interact with both adults and children of all ages.G√∂nc√º, A., Mistry, J., & Mosier, C. (2000). Cultural variations in the play of toddlers. International Journal of Behavioral Development, 24(3), 321-329. Maya siblings also play an active role in directing each other's learning.Maynard, A. E. (2002). Cultural teaching: The development of teaching skills in Maya sibling interactions. Child development, 73(3), 969-982. Children in Maya communities also observe and participate in adult work in order to become active members in their community.Nimmo, J. (2008). Young children's access to real life: An examination of the growing boundaries between children in child care and adults in the community. Contemporary Issues in Early Childhood, 9, 3-13. Though children in European American communities do not engage in as much productive or goal-driven work, Maya children see this work as embodying their sense of self-worth.Woodhead, M. (1998). Children's perspectives on their working lives: A participatory study in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, the Philippines, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua. Stockholm: Save the Children Sweden. Maya children engage in less imaginary play than children from many middle- class Western communities. When European-American adults play with children, the play is seen as an educational exercise, but play that Maya children partake in is often an emulation of mature work happening around themMorelli, G., Rogoff, B., & Angelillo, C. (2003). For example, a child will pretend to \\"weave\\" on a make-believe loom, or \\"wash clothes\\" by pouring water on a cloth.Rogoff, Barbara (2011). Developing Destinies: A Mayan Midwife and Town. Cambridge: Oxford University Press In this way, Maya children are learning through play. Engaging in play that emulates work, and providing actual contributions to work, are characteristic of a style of learning referred to as Learning by Observing and Pitching In (which was previously called Intent Community ParticipationRogoff, B., Paradise, R., Arauz, R. M., Correa-Chavez, M., & Angelillo, C. (2003). Firsthand learning through intent participation. Annual Review of Psychology, 54(1), 175-203). This approach involves the learner observing and listening, directed by their own initiative and concentration. This individual drive to learn is coupled with the learner's expected participation in shared endeavors. In other words, Maya children learn through Intent Community Participation because they are self-motivated to learn, and are included and given responsibilities. Maya children are respected as capable contributors to their community from as young as age 3 or 4. This style of learning can be contrasted with other learning styles, such as assembly-line instruction. Assembly-line instruction is the approach taken by most Westernized schooling. Assembly-line instruction is based on the transmission of knowledge from experts to subordinates, in a way that does not facilitate purposeful activity. Maya Children do not participate primarily in this style of learning, because they learn through inclusion and hands-on experience. Because of this form of learning, Mayan children are much more observant in their environment as compared to European-American children. Learning through observation and participation develops skills such as dual attentiveness which supports their way of life and learning. Through methods such as Learning by Observing and Pitching In, Maya children work as a community to build their skills for contributing in their community.

They had many traditions to commemorate the recently deceased and worship long-departed ancestors.

The reason a violent death led to one souls being able to immediately enter the Mayan heaven is because the gods are thankful for your sacrifice to them. People who were to eventually become sacrifices were paraded in litters by citizens before their death.Joshua J. Mark. Maya Religion: The Light That Came From Beside The Sea. The Afterlife. The Ancient Encyclopedia (09 July 2012). Available at: https://www.ancient.eu/article/414/maya-religion-the- light-that-came-from-beside-the-/ Before Spanish influence, there may not have been a common idea of the afterlife. The Yucatec Maya believed that there were different routes after death. A pot from a Pacal tomb depicts ancestors of Maya kings sprouting through the earth like fruit trees and together creating an orchard. The Maya had several forms of ancestor worship. They built idols containing ashes of the dead and brought them food on festival days. Alternatively, a temple could be built over an urn. In those that were sacrificed, the most common way was cutting the abdomen, and taking out the heart. Customs The Maya dead were laid to rest with maize placed in their mouth. Maize, highly important in Maya culture, is a symbol of rebirth and also was food for the dead for the journey to the otherworld. Similarly, a jade or stone bead placed in the mouth served as currency for this journey.The practice of wrapping royalty was meant to localize their remains to a finite space. Moutray bundles would be overlapped with depictions of deity bundles and covered in cinnabar signified rebirth. Marine artifacts in a tomb were meant to create a sense that the body has been set within a cave or upon the underworld. Bloodletting artifacts can be found amongst the dead at the Caracol site. A corpse being buried with these artifacts was to praise God A‚Äô. Most royalty were buried along with headdress, bracelets, and necklaces.Once a tomb was closed burning took place on top of it to signify the soul leaving the royal body and transforming into an ancestral state. The human remains in a temple were believed to have had power to animate buildings.James L. Fitzsimmons. Death And The Classic Maya Kings, Chapter Three Royal Funerals pages. 61-104. University of Texas Press, Austin, Texas (2009). Often, whistles carved from rocks into the shapes of gods or animals were included in the grave offerings to help the deceased find their way to Xibalba. When a typical Mayan citizen died their family and close friends would begin fasting and procuring goods. To which then they would hold an all-night vigil around the corpse and burn incense calling on their ancestors to watch over the new soul in its journey in the underworld. The elders would then wash the corpse and cloth it, being buried naked was an insult in Mayan culture. Being buried naked meant you were usually a foreign captive. The elders then would carry the corpse to the church. Elders could only handle the corpse rather than the family because there was fear of impotent taken into death by the soul. On the way to the church the chuchjaw would beat the ground so the soul would not linger on Earth. Once at the church, elders would spin the corpse several times so the soul would lose track from its home. Once the corpse was buried the family would hold a feast and abandon the person's house who has passed. The houses of the dead become abandoned because it was believed that nine days after a successful journey through the underworld by the soul it would return to its home and sleep for nine days. It is during this nine-day period that the Mayans believed they could die by the soul who has returned home. James L. Fitzsimmons. Death And The Classic Maya Kings, Chapter Three Royal Funerals pages. 61-104. University of Texas Press, Austin, Texas (2009). The Maya associated the color red with death and rebirth and often covered graves and skeletal remains with cinnabar. The bodies of the dead were wrapped in cotton mantles before being buried. Burial sites were oriented to provide access to the otherworld. Graves faced north or west, in the directions of the Maya heavens, and others were located in caves, entrances to the underworld. Burial practices of the Maya changed over the course of time. In the late Preclassic period, people were buried in a flexed position, later the dead were laid to rest in an extended position. In the late Classic period, the elite constructed vaulted tombs, and some rulers ordered the construction of large burial complexes. In the Postclassic period, cremation became more common. Other burial practices included bodily humanation with structures, structures directly overhead of the burial site, preferred single interments over multiple interments, the removal of skulls with a bowl or shell over or under the skull, specific skeletal position, prevailing head orientations, jade mosaic masks, and shell figurines. In Mayan culture the dead would be steeled like the Hero Twins to have a better chance in their journey. James L. Fitzsimmons. Death And The Classic Maya Kings pg.65. University of Texas Press, Austin, Texas (2009).  Beliefs about the afterlife  Mayan death god in the lunar eclipse tables of the Dresden Codex The Maya believe that the soul is bound to the body at birth. Only death or sickness can part the body and soul, with death being the permanent parting. To them, there is an afterlife that the soul reaches after death. In that, deceased ancestors can still contact their descendants, answering advice when they are asked. This contact can be used at certain times in the season, or when certain family matters pertain to the ancestors. Understanding the perception of what the deceased do in their afterlife can give ideas towards what rituals need to be performed and what types of items one must be buried with in order to successfully navigate the afterlife.  Reincarnation  The aspect of reincarnation is one strongly mentioned in Mayan beliefs and religion. The Popol Vuh gives importance to the Maize deity, and how the Mayan people themselves descended from maize people created by this god. In the Popol Vuh that the K ºiche º Maya wrote, one of the few surviving codices, it tells the story of the reincarnation of the Maize god. In the tale, the maize god retreats to the underworld and with two hero twins battling the monsters and lords of the place, makes way back to the earthen world. He is reborn again, dies, and on and on the cycle continues. In this aspect, it is believed by the Mayans that the Earth itself is a living being. As they came from corn, consuming corn or having sex then brings one closer to the earth.  Ideas about the afterlife  The concept of the afterlife, or Xibalba, differs between the Mayan ethnic groups. Many have a generalized belief of all souls going to the afterlife, being reincarnated or having another role to participate in after death, but these ideas change dramatically with the rise of Christianity. With that came the idea of Xibalba being a location of punishment. The longer one spent in Xibalba, the worse a life they led while living. With this belief, heaven became a paradise for many to strive for. The Chontal of Tabasco are an example of this.  Ethnic groups  To the Awakateko and the Chuj, the ancestors remain in contact and have the ability to affect the affairs of the living even in death. The Awakateko believed that the afterlife is a place where all ancestors remain, and that there is nowhere to pass on to. But to the Chuj, any contracts made with the dead are binding. If one does not follow these contracts, the ancestor can plague the one bound to the contract with illness or misfortune. To Them, they can contact their ancestors at altars, caves, or places connected to Mayan societies. The association of caves to the underworld is one intertwined with the older Mayan civilization and is an aspect continued by the Chuj people. There are other ethnic groups that believe ritual items are needed in order to make the journey into the afterlife. The Lakandon bury their people facing the sun, and wrapped in a tunic and hammock. Q ºeqchi º bury their dead in a straw sleeping mat, with a hat, sandals and a net provided to help in the journey to the afterlife. In others it was believed a dog was needed to help make the journey through the afterlife. Often a dog was ritually sacrificed, or an effigy buried along with the deceased in order to complete this task. Usually, the goods buried with the person were what the tribe believed was needed to complete one's cross into the next, whether it be the afterlife, heaven or reincarnation. Other ethnic groups believed that the spirits of the dead still had tasks to complete in the afterlife. The Mam, before fully accepting Christian values thought that the dead lived within volcanoes and other places. To the Tz ºutujil, souls of the dead might be reincarnated or go to assist in moving the sun across the sky. The Tz ºutujil in Santiago feared that souls of drowning victims inhabited the bottom of Lake Atitlan. With this difference in the idea of what one's ancestor does in death, came a change in how and what they were buried with. Those who still had a journey or a task may need more or less items, and it depended on how those of the tribe believed on what occurred after death. But many ethnic groups also observed a celebration of their deceased ancestors later on. The Poqomam gather after death and hold a feast that may last for nine days. Then they pray for that deceased person every day of the dead for the next seven years. The Tzotzil of Chamula also have a similar holiday for celebrating the dead, though theirs occurs every year. Their belief is that souls return to visit and partake of food once a year, in a celebration called K ºin Santo. The family members must perform a ritual to the deities to ask release of the souls of their dead relatives and to allow them entrance into the house. Tombs There have been many archaeological discoveries of lavish tombs within ceremonial complexes from the Classic period. However, only a Maya city's most important ruler was buried in this way. These aristocrats were placed in tombs at the bottoms of funerary pyramids that sometimes consisted of nine stepped platforms, perhaps symbolizing the nine layers of the underworld. Other temples were constructed with 13 vaults symbolizing the layers of the heavens in Maya cosmology. These temples reflected the continued worship of these nobles. In some instances, members of the royal family or young attendants would be sacrificed to accompany the lord in death. The tombs were filled with precious goods including fine polychrome pottery, effigy figurines, jade and marble pieces, masks, mushroom figures. While these figures were found in Maya tombs, many of these items were also used in the service of food, drink and for additional ritual purposes. Obsidian and exotic shells have also been found in Mayan tombs. In the Tomb of the Red Queen inside Temple XIII in Palenque, the remains of a noble woman and all the objects inside the sarcophagus were completely covered with bright red vermilion dust, made of ground cinnabar, perhaps intended to suggest blood, the symbol of life. Other elite members of society were buried in vaults. The bodies of higher-ranking members of society were buried inside sarcophagi. They sometimes were buried in crypts or underneath the family home. These funerary constructions of the royal often destroyed the residence itself. Commoners were also buried near or under their houses. These graves did not have extensive burial offerings, but often contained objects that identified the individual: a tool or possession.

The monument, depicting two human figures reaching out hands to each other, stood high on Kazƒ±ktepe Hill across from the ancient Castle of Kars outside of the city and would have been visible from neighboring Armenia when completed. It was commissioned by , the former mayor of Kars, as a gesture of reconciliation in Armenia‚ÄìTurkey relations following a 2009 accord to establish formal diplomatic recognition between the two. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan described the monument as a \\"freak\\" () during a visit to Kars in January 2011. In spite of protests, the city authority decided to remove the statue. In April 2011, works began to demolish it. Erdoƒüan insists that this was merely a question of aesthetics, yet according to The Economist the demolition could have been an attempt to appeal to nationalist sentiment ahead of the 2011 general election. As a response to Erdoƒüan's comments, Aksoy filed a lawsuit against Erdoƒüan for insulting him. In March 2015, a court fined Erdoƒüan 10,000 Turkish lira for calling the work a \\"freak\\".

These included: floodlit courts, a sports hall, a gymnasium with a sprung wooden floor, a fully equipped fitness suite, a meeting room, a community lounge, offices and a reception area. All these areas were accessible to people with disabilities. The school was last inspected by OFSTED in September 2006. As part of Southampton City Council's review of secondary schooling in the city, called Learning Futures, the school closed in September 2008.Secondary Education Review - Pre-Statutory Consultation Outcome and Proposals for further development, a report to Southampton City Council Cabinet, 19 June 2006 From September 2008 the school site has acted as the lower school of Oasis Academy Lord's Hill, while the former Oaklands Community School site is the upper school, until new premises are built around 2012, when both existing sites will close.

Biography  Enrique was the son of one of El Salvador's ruling families. He was intelligent, charismatic and wealthy. His mother was surnamed C√≥rdova. √Ålvarez attended Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. During his time there he was involved in Kappa Sigma (Gamma Upsilon). After a frustrated attempt to be a Salvadoran \\"New Dealer,\\" attempting to implement agrarian reform as El Salvador's minister of agriculture and cattle raising, √Ålvarez dramatically changed course and joined the Democratic Revolutionary Front (Frente Democr√°tico Revolucion√°rio or FDR).Lamperti, Enrique Alvarez: ¬°Presente!  Death  On November 27th, 1980, √Ålvarez and five other FDR directors were kidnapped from a meeting in El Salvador's capital, San Salvador. According to the November 29th, 1980 issue of El Diario de Hoy cited by former Dartmouth researcher John W. Lamperti, their bodies were discovered outside the capital on November 28th. Enrique himself had \\"sustained twelve bullet wounds: ten in the back, one in the head and one in the arm, plus three other wounds in the back.\\"https://math.dartmouth.edu/~lamperti/centralamerica_presente.html Enrique Alvarez: ¬° Presente !  Aftermath  The right-wing extremist group Maximiliano Hern√°ndez Mart√≠nez Anti-Communist Brigade (Br√≠gada Anticomunista Maximiliano Hern√°ndez Mart√≠nez) claimed responsibility for the kidnapping and subsequent murders. Given the volatile situation present at the time, the crime sparked public outcry, curtailing hopes for a political solution to the Salvadoran Civil War, which began that same year. Despite denying any involvement, in 1993 the post-Salvadoran Civil War United Nations Truth Commission reported a strong connection between high level government security forces and Enrique's murder, however it was unable to identify the perpetrators.Betancur, Belisario Figueredo, et al. ‚ÄúFrom Madness to Hope: the 12-Year War in El Salvador:Report of the Commission on the Truth for El Salvador.‚Äù United States Institute of Peace, 1993, pp. 50‚Äì54., https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/ElSalvador-Report.pdf.

Typical Mayan dish: corn dough mixed with turkey and vegetables, wrapped and baked in a plantain leaf. Ancient Maya cuisine was varied and extensive. Many different types of resources were consumed, including maritime, flora, and faunal material, and food was obtained or produced through strategies such as hunting, foraging, and large-scale agricultural production. Plant domestication concentrated upon several core foods, the most important of which was maize. Much of the ancient Maya food supply was grown in agricultural fields and forest gardens, known as pet kot. The system takes its name from the low wall of stones (pet meaning \\"circular\\" and kot \\"wall of loose stones\\") that characteristically surrounded the gardens. The ancient Maya adopted a number of adaptive techniques that, if necessary, allowed for the clear-cutting of land and re-infused the soil with nutrients. Among these was slash-and-burn, or swidden, agriculture, a technique that cleared and temporarily fertilized the area. For example, the introduction of ash into the soil raises the soil's pH. This in turn temporarily raises the content of a variety of nutrients, especially phosphorus. The effect lasts about two years. However, the soil will not remain suitable for planting for as many as ten years. This technique, common throughout the Maya area, is still practiced in the region today. Complementing swidden techniques were crop rotation and farming, employed to maintain soil viability and increase the variety of crops. To understand how and in what quantities food resources were relied upon by the Ancient Maya, stable isotopic analysis has been utilized. This method allows for the stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes to be chemically extracted from animal and human skeletal remains. These elements are then run through a mass spectrometer and the values display the enrichment of maize and the extent of aquatic resources in an individual's diet. Many foods and food production techniques used by the ancient Maya civilization remain in use today by the modern Mayan peoples, and many have spread far beyond the Maya region. Ethnohistoric and paleoethnobotanical evidence for plant staples Varieties of maize Paleoethnobotanical studies consist of the examination of micro and macro plant remains found within measured units of soil taken from an archaeological context. Macro-remains are separated from the soil through a flotation process while microremains are chemically extracted from the flotation samples. The earliest archaeological plant remains within the Maya region are from Cuello, Belize, and predate Preclassic sites. The majority of plant remains fall within the Preclassic-Postclassic and allow for researchers to discuss subsistence patterns that revolve around domesticated and wild/partially cultivated plants. Information for the Classic period, the most widely studied period for the Maya civilization, come from the sites of Cob√°, Cer√©n, Dos Pilas, Wild Cane Cay, Cop√°n, Tikal, and R√≠o Azul. This range of sites also allows for insight into regional differences based on the environment and access to local resources, such as aquatic and marine life. Ancient Maya diet focused on four domesticated crops (staple crops): maize, squash, beans (typically Phaseolus vulgaris) and chili peppers. The first three cultivars are commonly referred to in North America as the \\"Three Sisters\\" and, when incorporated in a diet, complement one another in providing necessary nutrients.Mt. Pleasant, Jane (2006). \\"The science behind the Three Sisters mound system: An agronomic assessment of an indigenous agricultural system in the northeast\\". In John E. Staller, Robert H. Tykot, and Bruce F. Benz. Histories of maize: multidisciplinary approaches to the prehistory, linguistics, biogeography, domestication, and evolution of maize. Amsterdam. pp. 529‚Äì537. Among the three, maize was the central component of the diet of the ancient Maya, and figured prominently in Maya mythology and ideology. Archaeological evidence suggests that Chapalote-Nal-Tel was the dominant species; however, it is likely others were being exploited also. Maize was used and eaten in a variety of ways, but was always nixtamalized. Nixtamalization (a term that derives from the Nahuatl word for the process) is a procedure in which maize is soaked and cooked in an alkaline solution. This releases niacin, a necessary B vitamin (vitamin B3) that prevents pellagra and reduces incidents of protein deficiency. Once nixtamalized, maize was typically ground up on a metate and prepared in a number of ways. Tortillas, cooked on a comal and used to wrap other foods (meat, beans, etc.), were common and are perhaps the best-known pre-Columbian Mesoamerican food. Tamales consist of corn dough, often containing a filling, that is wrapped in a corn husk and steam-cooked. Both atole and pozole were liquid-based gruel-like dishes that were made by mixing ground maize (hominy) with water, with atole being denser and used as a drinking source and pozole having complete big grains of maize incorporated into a turkey broth. Though these dishes could be consumed plain, other ingredients were added to diversify flavor, including chili peppers, cacao, wild onions and salt. Along with maize and beans, both domestic and wild, squash was relied on, as is evident from the remains at Joya de Cer√©n, El Salvador. An alternative view is that manioc cassava was the easily grown staple crop of the ancient Maya and that maize was revered because it was prestigious and harder to grow. This proposal was based on the inability of maize to meet the nutritional needs of densely populated Maya areas. Manioc can meet those needs. Because tuberous manioc rarely survives in the archaeological record, evidence for this view has been lacking, although recent finds in volcanic ash at the southern Maya site of Joya de Cer√©n in El Salvador may be such evidence. thumb Several different varieties of beans were grown, including pinto, red and black beans. The ancient Maya also relied on tree-cropping for access to foods such as tomato, chili peppers, avocado, breadnut, guava, soursop, mammee apple, papaya, pineapple, pumpkin, sweet potato, and Xanthosoma. Chaya was cultivated for its green leaves. Chayote was cultivated for its fruit, and its tender green shoots were used as a vegetable. Various herbs were grown and used, including vanilla, epazote, achiote (and the annatto seed), Canella, Hoja santa (Piper auritum), avocado leaves, garlic vine, Mexican oregano, and allspice. While paleoethnobotanical remains demonstrate these crops were relied on in some form by all Maya groups, it is clear that different subsistence strategies were relied on. For instance, some fields were planted away from the household groups while some fields were adjacent to households. Farming techniques include terracing, raised fields, check dams, drained fields, kitchen gardens, forest gardens, and other forms of irrigation. Other crops have also been investigated as part of the diet of Ancient Maya; chili peppers, manioc, cotton, and agave are thought to have been cultivated in gardens tended near the home. Ethnohistorical and zooarchaeological evidence of meat usage Hunting is believed to have supplied the ancient Maya with their main source of meat, though several animals, such as dog pek and turkey ulumMayan dictionary (1997). Wired Humanities Project. Retrieved September 13, 2012, from link , may have been domesticated. Animals hunted for meat as well as for other purposes include deer, manatee, armadillo, tapir, peccary, monkey, guinea pig and other types of fowl, turtle and iguana, with the majority of meat coming from white-tailed deer, as is evident from animal remains found in middens. The ancient Maya diet was also supplemented by the exploitation, at least in coastal areas, of maritime resources, including fish, lobster, shrimp, conch, and other shellfish. The zooarchaeological evidence from the sites of Lamanai and Tipu have provided considerable information about the types of animals being exploited. The zooarchaeological evidence (5,737 remains from Lamanai and 24,590 remains from Tipu) were collected from midden deposits and structures near and in the ceremonial center of the site. While white-tailed deer remain the most exploited animal at the sites throughout time, there are shifts over time from larger mammals to small mammals, aviary species such as turkey, and aquatic resources such as fish, turtles, and mollusks. While it may seem improbable that aquatic resources were being exploited by inland sites, the site of Caracol, located in the Maya Mountains of Belize, displays evidence of marine resources being brought to the site and transported while still alive. Archaeological evidence supported this, as a diverse set of marine resources were found from subsistence and ceremonial contexts at Caracol. The most likely candidates for this type of live transport from the ocean up to the mountains by river would be stingrays, grunts, sea catfish, and parrotfish.  Stable isotopic evidence of the ancient Maya diet  Stable isotopic analysis of carbon and nitrogen from human skeletal remains has been conducted at multiple Maya archaeological sites from the lowlands of Belize, the Peten, the Yucat√°n peninsula, and the highlands of Guatemala. The first applications of this practice were conducted on the remains found in the Tehuacan Valley and suggest that maize was a dietary staple as early at 4500 BP. However, the bulk of information is represented by over 600 individuals dating from the Preclassic to the Postclassic period and substantiates that subsistence adaptations were present and caused by chronology, geographic and environmental factors, and cultural pressures. In the Maya lowlands of Belize, carbon and nitrogen data from collagen have been analyzed from ten sites. The average C13 collagen values are -12.6 ¬± 1.2 per mil, indicating that C4 sources made up 50% of the ancient Maya diet. These average values change very slightly in the Early, Late, and Terminal Classic periods, with averages of -11.3 ¬± -2.3 per mil. In the Peten region, Preclassic values for collagen C13 average -10.2 ¬± -1.2 per mil, indicating that C4 sources made up 70% of the ancient Maya diet in this region. These differences in the region may be attributed to the greater access to marine and aquatic resources in Belize. As discussed earlier, there is evidence that marine animals were being brought alive to inland sites by means of river waterways. Areas of the Peten and the Yucat√°n may have been too far away from coastal regions for this concept to be utilized. Diet varied greatly by site and region. For example, at Pacbitun maize was found to be heavily relied upon by the elite males found in the ceremonial center. This goes against ideas about maize as a commoner food and the idea that elites had greater access to a wide variety of resources. Furthermore, this data contradicts what is found about elite diets at other sites like Copan and Lamania. Overall, maize played a large role in the diet at the site, but access to maize varied by age, sex, and social status. Adult males consumed more than females and children, and this difference is most likely caused by social status. Furthermore, maize consumption varied through time. During the flourishing periods of the Early and Late Classic, maize constituted about 72-77% of the diet of individuals living at Pacbitun. This drops 10% in the Terminal Classic, as the population became less reliant on maize. This could be caused by a more diverse diet due to trade or increased reliance on other local foods. Another possibility is that attempts at producing enough maize to support the growing population failed.  Ancient Mayan cuisine present in modern cuisine  The origins of Mayan cuisine can be established by archaeological evidence, dating as early as 1500 B.C. and extending through the 16th century A.D. With maize as a significant and sustainable food source, the Maya expanded their palate and began to cultivate and incorporate many other foods into their diet. The evolution of Maya food culture allowed for experimentation with new staples and the development of new Maya cuisine. These, in turn, became established in modern food practices of the Mayan peoples and many other peoples of the Americas. In the 21st century, many foods that come from ancient Maya techniques, such as chocolate, avocado/guacamole, tortillas, and tamales, have spread far beyond the Maya region. Common cocoa seed that would be used to make hot chocolate. Chocolate: The cocoa tree is native to Maya territory, and the Maya are believed to be the first people to have cultivated the cacao plant for food.Bogin 1997, Coe 1996, Montejo 1999, Tedlock 1985 For the ancient Maya, cocoa was a sacred gift from the gods. The cocoa plant, theobroma, literally translates to \\"food of the gods\\". Cacao beans were historically used as ceremonial sacrifices to the Mayan gods. Cocoa was enjoyed by all social classes of the ancient Maya people because of its stimulative aphrodisiac powers. Maya couples drank chocolate during ceremonies of marriage and engagement. The cocoa beans were also ground and mixed with chili peppers, cornmeal and honey to create a drink called xocolatl (a Nahuatl word), which only the rich and noble could drink. This ancient Maya chocolate drink was much different than today's hot chocolate; it may have been served unsweetened and with a frothy texture. Avocado/Guacamole: Originating from southern Mexico and Guatemala, avocados became a staple of Mayan cuisine. The Avocado tree thrives in subtropical climates that existed during the Maya civilization. Avocados are a versatile product that are incorporated in modern cuisine. They have a smooth texture, and rich and buttery taste, which has made them a popular appetizer. Corn Tortillas: Maize plays a central role in Mayan culture and mythology. It is said in the Popul Vuh that the first humans were crafted from an ear of corn. The Maya creation story contends that people were fundamentally made of masa or corn dough. Tortillas, imbued by the divine quality of maize, offered countless opportunities for food creation and allowed people of all economic standings to eat freely. Ancient Maya tortillas differ from their modern counterparts. The ancient Mayans produced a small three to four-inch masa patty that was thicker than today's version to provide a sturdy base for the dish they would be serving. These dishes often included meat and avocado or could be a side for a stew at a ritualistic meeting. Today's tortillas are thinner and often larger in diameter than ancient Maya tortillas. The presence of tortillas serves as a base for many different food dishes, including tacos, burritos, quesadillas, chips, soups, and even crepes. Mayan civilian with tamales as offerings for the gods. Tamales: Crafted from masa, or corn dough, and a mix of meat and vegetables, tamales have historically been one of the world's most convenient foods because of their ease of transport. Like many popular dishes in ancient Maya culture, the tamal included the use of the corn husks or banana leaves to ferment and enhance the cooking process of the meal. After the cooking process, the tamal would be unwrapped and topped with salsa, which could be eaten on the go. Often, tamales would be served at Maya holiday celebrations. Maya women would also sell freshly made tamales, often in exchange for cocoa seeds. Ancient evidence of tamales are prominent on many Maya artifacts and paintings. The modern tamal is enjoyed in much the same way as in ancient Maya cuisine.

The show is produced by NBA Entertainment. During its earlier years on NBA TV, the series would air frequently in various timeslots, including at a set time on Thursday afternoons for a number of years. However, as the network has increased its output of originally-produced programming and live game coverage, Hardwood Classics airs more sporadically, with its most frequent airings taking place during the NBA offseason. Format history Each episode normally airs two hours in length (condensed down from the normal two-and-a-half-hour length of a live telecast), although there have been some episodes that were only thirty to sixty minutes long, due to lack of complete footage, or were preserved as newsreels for a majority of games played in the 1950s. And there are still some episodes which were aired in a full two-and-a-half hours of game time. Some recent games, however (e.g. 2008 NBA Finals) were shortened to only an hour despite the full two-hour availability of game footage; they did manage to air Game 4 of that series in full when it was shown as part of the Lakers vs. Celtics finals marathon in 2010. In addition, stock footage was also used and spliced to a previously aired game, as seen in the baseline camera angles substituting for the normal television game angles during Game 5 of the 1993 First Round between the New Jersey Nets and Cleveland Cavaliers. NBA's Greatest Games The series, originally titled NBA's Greatest Games, debuted in 1999, alongside the formation of NBA TV (then NBA.com TV). The program was re-titled NBA TV: Hardwood Classics, presented by The History Channel, in March 2004 (retitled simply as NBA TV: Hardwood Classics when it moved to NBA TV in 2005). However, some episodes still run under the Greatest Games title, although recent re- airings of prior Greatest Games episodes were now retitled under the Hardwood Classics banner. As Hardwood Classics In this re-formatted version, the program features interviews and trivia tidbits pertaining to the game being presented. Hardwood Classics features footage used by the NBA's past and present broadcasting partners, such as ABC, CBS, ESPN, NBC, TBS, TNT, and USA Network, as well as locally produced broadcasts from the individual NBA franchises. In 2009, Hardwood Classics also began to broadcast condensed 30-minute episodes of the NBA All-Star Weekend Slam Dunk Contest, beginning with the 1984 contest. These programs are shown only during the month of February, which coincides with the NBA All-Star Weekend. Beginning in 2010, Hardwood Classics is hosted by Marc Fein, and later by either Matt Winer or Rick Kamla, who gives a preview of the selected game as well as facts that followed the game. Previously, Andre Aldridge hosted the program from 2004‚Äì05. Hardwood Classics also lends its name to the Mitchell & Ness clothing line of authentic vintage NBA jerseys, as well as the annual throwback game series \\"Hardwood Classics Nights\\", featuring NBA teams in throwback uniforms. During the 2011 NBA lockout, Hardwood Classics was aired on NBA TV on a daily basis, usually twice a day, primarily to fill in programming hours. This is because recent footage of active NBA players could not be aired per agreement by the league during the lockout, instead NBA TV focused on programming featuring NBA legends during this period, other than ongoing WNBA and NBA Development League games. More recent episodes focused more on an individual player or team accomplishments aside from games which feature signature plays and series/championship victories. Some games previously aired under the \\"Greatest Games\\" title were re-aired under the \\"Hardwood Classics\\" banner. Every Monday, Hardwood Classics was promoted as 'Old School Monday' and two games or more featuring a significant milestone or moment were aired. 'Old School Monday' airs only during the NBA off-season. Beginning in October, a variation of Hardwood Classics called 'Classic Quarters' is also aired, in which a thirty- minute episode was dedicated to a particular quarter of a classic NBA game. Even though NBA TV now airs in high definition, Hardwood Classics continue to be shown in standard definition, one of only a few programs on NBA TV to do so. This applies only, however, to games shown before the availability of high definition (e.g. games prior to 2007). Notable episodes The episodes that have been broadcast on this series have been mostly playoffs and Finals games, but it also features significant games with great personal accomplishments, such as: *Kobe Bryant's 81-point game vs. the Toronto Raptors in January 2006. *Michael Jordan's 63-point game vs. the Boston Celtics in the 1986 NBA Playoffs. *Michael Jordan's 55-point game vs. the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on March 28, 1995, in one of his first games upon returning from his first retirement. *Kevin Garnett's NBA debut versus the Sacramento Kings at Sacramento in November 1995. *The playoff duel between Hall of Famers Dominique Wilkins of the Atlanta Hawks and Larry Bird of the Boston Celtics in a 1988 playoff game in Boston Garden. *Charles Barkley of the Philadelphia 76ers making his NBA debut against the then-Washington Bullets at the Spectrum in Philadelphia. *Julius Erving's final NBA All-Star Game appearance in 1987 at Seattle's Kingdome. *Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's final All-Star Game appearance in 1989 at the Houston Astrodome. *At Denver's now-demolished McNichols Sports Arena, the Denver Nuggets hosted the Detroit Pistons on December 13, 1983 in what still is the NBA's highest scoring game ever, with Detroit winning 186‚Äì184 in triple-overtime. This game also set the record for the most players in a single game to score 40 or more points, as Piston players Isiah Thomas and John Long scored 47 and 41 points respectively, while Denver's Kiki Vandeweghe led all scorers with 51 points and teammate Alex English scored 47. *At Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey on December 7, 2006, the Phoenix Suns and New Jersey Nets played in the fourth-highest scoring game in NBA history, with the Suns winning in a 161‚Äì157 final score in double-overtime. *Shaquille O'Neal's NBA debut versus the Miami Heat at Orlando on November 6, 1992. *Considered by many as the greatest basketball game ever, the upstart Suns took the Celtics to triple-overtime, with the Celtics winning Game 5 of their NBA Finals series, 128‚Äì126, on June 4, 1976 at Boston Garden. *The Toronto Raptors in their first year in the NBA upset the Jordan-led Chicago Bulls, who went on to have a record-breaking 72-win season. As sort of a special treat for fans, NBA TV normally broadcasts a Hardwood Classics/Greatest Games episode that features a significant game between two franchises that happen to play each other in a game taking place on that same night. On or around Christmas, NBA TV shows marathons of classic Christmas Day games. These games are from as far back as 1970 and often feature the New York Knicks (with 45 appearances, by far the most of any NBA franchise, including 27 straight years from 1961‚Äì88), while other teams are featured as well. One example of this was the Christmas Day 1985 matchup between the Knicks and the eventual champion Boston Celtics where the Knicks trailed 58-33 in the third period, yet came back to force overtime, eventually winning 114-103 in two overtimes. Another notable Knicks Christmas Day game took place a year earlier, featuring them and cross-river rival New Jersey Nets at Madison Square Garden, in which Knicks forward Bernard King scored 60 points in a 120-114 New York loss. The earliest Christmas Day telecast in the NBA TV archives is a 1970 ABC telecast, between the Hawks and Suns from the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix, with the Suns winning 127-115. There have been several Hardwood Classics episodes that were re-edited and remastered. For instance, Game 6 of the 2006 NBA Finals, first aired in early 2007, was re-aired three years later with a shortened version of the Miami Heat's championship awarding ceremonies. As mentioned, Game 4 of the 2008 NBA Finals, originally an hour long when it first aired in late 2008, was broadcast in a full two hours when it was re-aired in 2010. In contrast, Larry Bird's 49-point performance against the Portland Trail Blazers in 1992 was originally aired as a two-hour episode in 1999, but was shortened to an hour when it was re-aired in 2004, only covering the latter stages of the fourth quarter and two overtimes. Some Hardwood Classics games were aired with one portion of the broadcast handled by a local network, and another portion handled by either a national (or another local, preferably the opposing team's) network, handling play-by-play for the duration of a game, often due to audio problems or lack of footage. For example, a majority of Game 5 of the 1984 First Round between the New York Knicks and the Detroit Pistons used the MSG Network broadcast tandem of Marv Albert and Butch Beard, with the remainder handled by the Pistons' WDFN radio broadcast of George Blaha and Dave Bing. Another example was the rebroadcast of Game 5 of the 1987 Eastern Conference Finals between the Pistons and the Celtics, using both the TBS broadcast by Bob Neal and Doug Collins, and the SportsChannel New England broadcast by Mike Gorman and Tom Heinsohn.

History  Main assembly room of the Commission Legally, the commission's authority comes from agreements made at the Congress of Vienna, held in 1815 in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars. The first meeting took place on 15 August 1816 in Mainz. In 1831, the Convention of Mainz was adopted, establishing a number of the first laws governing Rhine navigation. In 1861, the commission's seat was moved to Mannheim, and on 17 October 1868, the Convention of Mannheim was agreed to. This agreement still governs the principles of Rhine navigation today. The member states are currently Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.The Integration of European Waterways, p. 12 The current revised convention was signed in Strasbourg by the five members of the commission and the United Kingdom on 20 November 1963 and entered into force on 14 April 1967.

In 2003 the European Commission asked for the permission of the Council of Ministers to negotiate the adherence of the European Union to the regulations of the CCNR and the Danube Commission, especially given the prospective enlargement of the EU. Individual German states were members before the First World War. The United States was temporarily a member immediately after the Second World War, while Germany was under Allied occupation, until 1961.

In 2014, the festival screened over 200 films, including feature films and short films, from different countries and regions. Besides screenings, the festival also contains different sections, including celebrity tributes, industry panels and education programs.  History  Though founded in 1986, the festival has developed and changed over years. When the present executive director, Roger Durling, first took over in 2002, he was confused by the low attendance of the film festival. It was believed that he noticed the \\"Sundance Effect\\" which refers to the popularity of Sundance Film Festival taking place in January. He then decided to move the festival to late January. Durling believed that by holding the film festival just days before Academy Awards in the spring, SBIFF can invite celebrities that have potential to win awards and provide audiences a chance meet them. Over the years, SBIFF has invited numerous potential award-winning celebrities, including Cate Blanchett, Martin Scorsese, Leonardo DiCaprio, Angelina Jolie, Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Winslet, and Heath Ledger.  Influence  It was believed that Santa Barbara International Film Festival tries to shine a light on independent and ethnic film-makers. In the past, Roger Durling saved a third of his festival's slots to films by Hispanic filmmakers in order to better represent Latino population in the area. Durling also decided to add nature films. \\"Now between you and me, I fall asleep at nature films,\\" he said. '\\"But hey ‚Äî they draw a huge crowd.\\" Later, he decided to bring in surf flicks and adventure-sports film that would attract young college students. \\"Film festivals have a tradition of being for the elite, but they shouldn't be\\", Durling said. \\"It should be like a candy store. Anyone should be able to walk in and grab whatever they want.\\" In the past, the festival has honored numerous independent filmmakers. Organizers of the festival have pointed out that some of their honorees were not the most popular stars, however, they all contributed to the industry at a great level. When Tom Selleck received a salute at SBIFF, Phyllis de Picciotto, the artistic director and founder of the festival back then, said that \\"He's not a movie star like Sigourney Weaver [another festival honoree], but he's such a special actor who's been all over the place. He's just tremendously appealing.\\"  Awards  * Maltin Modern Master Award * Montecito Award * Outstanding Performance of the Year * The American Riviera‚Ñ¢ Award * Cinema Vanguard Award * Virtuosos Award * The Panavision Spirit Award for Independent Cinema * The Best International Film Award * The Nueva Vision Award for the best Spanish/Latin American film * Best Documentary Film Award * Bruce Corwin Award for Best Live Action Short Film * Bruce Corwin Award for Best Animation Short Film * The Fund for Santa Barbara Social Justice Award * The Audience Choice Award * 10-10-10 Student Filmmaking Competition * 10-10-10 Student Screenwriting Competition  Montecito Award  * 2005 : Annette Bening * 2006 : Naomi Watts * 2007 : Bill Condon * 2008 : Javier Bardem * 2009 : Kate Winslet * 2010 : Julianne Moore * 2011 : Geoffrey Rush * 2013 : Daniel Day- Lewis * 2014 : Oprah Winfrey * 2015 : Jennifer Aniston * 2016 : Sylvester Stallone * 2017 : Isabelle Huppert * 2018 : Saoirse Ronan * 2019 : Melissa McCarthy * 2020 : Lupita Nyong'o  Outstanding Performance of the Year Award  * 2004 : Charlize Theron for The Italian Job and Monster * 2005 : Kate Winslet for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Finding Neverland * 2006 : Heath Ledger for Brokeback Mountain * 2007 : Helen Mirren for The Queen * 2008 : Angelina Jolie for A Mighty Heart * 2009 : Pen√©lope Cruz for Elegy and Vicky Cristina Barcelona * 2010 : Colin Firth for A Single Man * 2011 : James Franco for 127 Hours * 2012 : Viola Davis for The Help * 2013 : Jennifer Lawrence for Silver Linings Playbook and The Hunger Games * 2014 : Cate Blanchett for Blue Jasmine * 2015 : Steve Carell for Foxcatcher * 2016 : Brie Larson for Room & Saoirse Ronan for Brooklyn * 2017 : Ryan Gosling & Emma Stone for La La Land * 2018 : Allison Janney & Margot Robbie for I, Tonya * 2019 : Rami Malek for Bohemian Rhapsody * 2020 : Adam Driver & Scarlett Johansson for Marriage Story  American Riviera Award  * 2004 : Diane Lane * 2005 : Kevin Bacon * 2006 : Philip Seymour Hoffman * 2007 : Forest Whitaker * 2008 : Tommy Lee Jones * 2009 : Mickey Rourke * 2010 : Sandra Bullock * 2011 : Annette Bening * 2012 : Martin Scorsese * 2013 : Quentin Tarantino * 2014 : Robert Redford * 2015 : Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke * 2016 : Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams and Mark Ruffalo * 2017 : Jeff Bridges * 2018 : Sam Rockwell * 2019 : Viggo Mortensen * 2020 : Ren√©e Zellweger  10-10-10 Student Film Competition  One feature of the film festival is the 10-10-10 competition. Students currently enrolled at Santa Barbara area high schools and colleges are invited to submit either a 10-page sample of writing for the Screenwriting portion of the competition, or a five-minute sample of their best filmmaking efforts for the directing portion. Ten writers are selected to write one 10-minute script each; the scripts are then matched with the ten filmmakers. Those students then have ten days to shoot and edit the completed ten-minute short film, during the ten days of the festival. Films are screened and winners are announced on closing night. A selection committee consisting of representatives from each school, Industry professionals and SBIFF representatives select the participants.

Also starring is Sandi Carroll. The film tells the story of a confused soldier (played by Wright) who narrates throughout the movie his bizarre thoughts about the army and war in general, using Wright's trademark deadpan humor. Some of One Soldier was filmed on Block Island, an island off the coast of Rhode Island. Horses from a local stable on the island, Rustic Rides Farm, were used for the scene of Wright with horses on the beach. Plot The film is told entirely in retrospect, from a veteran of the American Civil War who may already have been executed. During the war, his job was to play music for a general who decided, in the soldier's words, \\"where hundreds of men would die.\\" He has come home from the war skeptical about the meaning of life (or that there is a meaning), and trying to search for answers. He attempts to express his thoughts and doubts to his wife Becky, but she remains unconvinced that life is horrible and thinks he is crazy and going to hell. Convinced that people have come to have too much influence over art, he tries to play music not written by people by drawing music lines on his glasses and playing the stars as if they were notes. He also tries to get in touch with God, but, not wanting to be intrusive, he merely hangs about outside the church and whispers through the windows, \\"God...hey, God...what're you doin'?\\" Finally, after many hints, it is revealed why he is sentenced to death: he fought in the war because a rich man paid him to fight in his (the rich man's) place. When the rich man showed up to see how he was fighting, he found the soldier standing and playing the concertina during a battle. The rich man gave him a gun and started yelling at him, so in frustration the soldier shot the rich man instead of the Confederates, picked up the concertina, and left him lying in the field. \\"He killed the wrong man in the war.\\" As he is about to be executed, the soldier has an epiphany: \\"My God...I wasted my whole life thinking about this stuff. I should have just gone fishing! I should have had a sandwich, or had a few laughs! Now I get it!\\" His illumination is cut off by the firing squad. He, perhaps in some sort of spirit form, walks through a graveyard and muses, \\"I'm gonna miss being alive.\\" The credits follow.

Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. is the worship of a book, idolatrous homage to a book, or the deifying of a book. It is a form of idolatry. The sacred texts of some religions disallow icon worship, but over time the texts themselves are treated as sacred the way idols are, and believers may end up effectively worshipping the book. Bibliolatry extends claims of inerrancy‚Äìhence perfection‚Äìto the texts, precluding theological innovation, evolving development, or progress. Bibliolatry can lead to revivalism, disallows re- probation, and can lead to persecution of unpopular doctrines. Christianity may use the term bibliolatry to characterize either extreme devotion to the Bible or the doctrine of biblical inerrancy. p. 307 Supporters of biblical inerrancy point to passages (such as 2 Timothy 3:16‚Äì17 \\"All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.\\" ), interpreted to say that the Bible, as received, is a complete source of what must be known about God. Critics of this view call it a form of idolatry, pointing to verses such as John 5:39‚Äì40 \\"Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me. And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.\\" to indicate that Jesus asked humanity to relate to God directly rather than blindly relying on written rules.Bible Study is Not Enough - Avoiding the ditch of Bibliolatry - Dr. Dan Hayden. Historically, Christianity has never endorsed worship of the Bible, reserving worship for God. Some Christians believe that biblical authority derives from God as the inspiration of the text, not from the text itself. The term \\"bibliolatry\\" does not refer to a recognized belief, but theological discussion may use the word pejoratively to label the perceived practices of opponents. For example: Opponents may apply the term \\"bibliolatry\\" to groups such as Protestants of a fundamentalist and evangelical background, such as the King James Only movement, who espouse biblical inerrancy and a sola scriptura approach (scripture as the only divine authority). Christianity Roman Catholicism and Eastern Christianity Catholicism traditionally sees scripture and sacred tradition as prima scriptura (rather than scripture alone), and has implicitly accused some Protestant sects of bibliolatry. Jaroslav Pelikan wrote about Unitatis redintegratio, \\"The Second Vatican Council of the Roman Catholic Church of 1962‚Äì1965 could speak with a mixture of genuine admiration and ever-so-gentle reproof about a 'love and reverence, almost a cult, for Holy Scripture' among the 'separated Protestant brethren.Jaroslav Pelikan (2006), Whose Bible Is It? A History of the Scriptures Through the Ages . The three independent branches of Eastern Christianity have voiced similar opinions and, with Catholicism and some Protestant opinion, have a higher view of the apostolic succession of bishops than Protestants who derive their faith primarily from the Reformed tradition or hold evangelical or low church views. Another influence on bibliolatry is the fact that nearly all of those who hold high views of the Bible's authority against tradition also tend to reject the biblical authority of the deuterocanonical books found in the Septuagint that Catholicism and Eastern Christianity regard as canonical. Protestants reject these books, despite their regard by the church for over a millennium before the reformers rejected their authority. Protestants tend to rely on the Masoretic Text of contemporary Judaism, which is rooted in the traditions of the Pharisees. Although Catholicism and Eastern Christianity do not fully agree about which books are deuterocanonical and which are not (with the Orthodox Tewahedo preserving the most inclusive set of books, many of which were not preserved elsewhere), the regard for the Septuagint held by the early church fathers is regarded as sound. Most Catholics and Eastern Christians agree with high- church Protestants that the Old Testament is best understood by studying the Masoretic Text and the Septuagint; modern Bible translations in these traditions often take both into consideration. The authority of the Protestant Reformers to reject books from the Christian biblical canon is seen as dubious. Those who view the Vulgate in Roman Catholicism, the Septuagint in Eastern Orthodoxy, the Peshitta in Syriac Christianity, or the Ge'ez Bible of the Orthodox Tewahedo as more authoritative than the Hebrew Old Testament or the Greek New Testament could be accused of bibliolatry for many of the same reasons that the King James Only movement is. Southern Baptists A change in wording of the Southern Baptist Convention's Baptist Faith and Message as a result of its conservative resurgence led to charges of bibliolatry. Bibliolatry ‚Äî A Fraudulent Accusation, William Merrell, SBC Life, October 2000. Sikhism Sikhism is a religion founded by Guru Nanak. It considers its scripture Guru Granth Sahib as the living Guru. Sikhs install it in the sanctum of Sikh temples, and devotees reverentially greet it by bowing and prostrating before it. Since the early 20th century, Farquhar and other scholars consider it as a form of idolatry that belivers practice the matha tekna (bowing down and touching one's head to the floor) at the door of a Gurdwara or before the Guru Granth Sahib, and other daily rituals such as putting the scripture to bed (sukhasan) in a bedroom (sachkhand), waking it up every morning, carrying it in a procession and re-opening it (prakash) in major Sikh Gurdwaras. When open in the sanctum of a Sikh Gurdwara, it is within an expensive brocade and attendants fan it as an act of homage. According to James Moffatt, the ritual veneration given by Sikhs to the Guru Granth Sahib is \\"true bibliolatry\\". The widespread devotional worship of the Guru Granth Sahib in these temples has drawn comparisons to the Sikh scripture is being ritually treated like an idol. In this view, idolatry is any form of worship or holy reverence to any object, such as an icon, a ritualized direction, or a house of worship. Scholars such as Eleanor Nesbitt state the Nanaksar Gurdwaras practice of offering food cooked by Sikh devotees to the Guru Granth Sahib, as well as curtaining the scripture during this ritual, as a form of idolatry. Baba Ishar Singh of this international network of Sikh temples has defended this practice because he states that the Sikh scripture is more than paper and ink. According to Kristina Myrvold, every Sikh scripture copy is treated like a person and venerated with elaborate ceremonies which are a daily means of \\"merit bestowing ministrations\\". These daily ritual ministrations and paying of homage for the scripture by Sikhs, states Myrvold, is not unique to Sikhism. It moulds \\"meanings, values and ideologies\\" and creates a framework for congregational worship, states Myrvold, that is found in all major faiths.

The magazine was originally an 11¬º by 15¬Ω-inch newsprint publication. It grew to a tabloid- sized, glossy-covered magazine in the late 1980s before shrinking back to standard magazine size (8 by 10 7/8) with a glossy cover in 1990. The Richmond, VA-based magazine was sold to Landmark Communications, which sold it to Krause Publications in 1999, publisher of the competing Sports Cards Magazine. The two magazines' content merged in 2000, taking the 'Tuff Stuff' name. The magazine took on the F+W Publications Inc. label after that company obtained Krause in 2002.About us on Tuff Stuff In addition to columns and feature stories, the magazine included yearly pricing for cards in six sports ‚Äî baseball, basketball, American football, ice hockey, golf and auto racing ‚Äî with roughly 100 pages of card pricing in each issue. This approach differs from its major competitor, Beckett, which published magazines devoted specifically to each sport. Issues of the magazine also included values and checklists for sports autographs, figures, and other sports collectibles. In January 2011, F+W announced that Tuff Stuff ceased publication, due to declining ad revenue, according to magazine staffers. Readers switch from print to electronic devises accelerated the demise of the magazine. In addition to the closure, Sports Collectors Digest, returned to a bi-monthly publication schedule. In January 2018, with the CEO and two other top executives leaving the company, F+W slashed its workforce by 40%. F+W filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on March 10, 2019. The book publishing assets of the company were won by Penguin Random House at a bankruptcy auction in June 2019. The grouping of the assets drew criticism.

It held a position on NAV's top 100 radio chart for over six months. Critical reception Bill Binkelman of Wind and Wire Magazine writes, \\"One Deep Breath is an album with two distinct 'feels' to it: the more serene new age/ambient soundscapes that bookend the inner tracks and the more radio-friendly and mainstream music in- between. While I doubt fans of Liquid Mind or other mainly electronic new-age music artists would wholly embrace the overt romanticism of piano-led tracks like 'Dancers Waltz' or 'Dreamer's Lullaby', there is definite appeal on the album for fans of adult contemporary piano pieces as well as for lovers of the more minimal approach to new-age music.\\" Reviewing for Solo Piano Publications, Kathy Parsons describes the album as \\"...a fascinating combination of structured melodic pieces and free-form, ambient compositions\\". Allmusic's, Jim Brenholts views One Deep Breath as a set of smooth adult contemporary pieces in which Joseph adds \\"world music flair and inspirational touches\\". \\"The vocal expressions by Clystie Whang and Joseph have devotional qualities that weave through the atmospheres and soundscapes smoothly.\\" \\"One Deep Breath opens with a fairly quiet and unassuming tone, and gradually reveals a highly sophisticated soundscape that keeps your attention for the full duration of the album\\", states Instrumental Weekly. The opening track, \\"Is This A Dream?\\", is a simple but \\"lovely\\" piano melody supported by various, understated synth elements. \\"Wildflowers\\" has been called \\"sweeping and romantic\\", and \\"rich sonic tapestry\\". \\"The wistful piano brings images of colored wildflowers gracefully bending in a gentle breeze.\\" \\"A Moments Rest\\" borders on melancholic, which serves as illustration of the range of emotions to be found on One Deep Breath. \\"Dance of Life\\" was inspired by Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k's \\"Rusalka\\". Parsons describes it as being both joyful and pensive - almost anthemic in places. It is a bit more straightforward in its piano presentation, and will probably appeal the most to hardcore fans of solo instrumental music, says Instrumental Weekly. Joseph reveals his jazzier side with \\"Water Voyage\\", giving way to some \\"slick synth work\\" along with \\"fantastic and moving vocalizations\\". \\"Inside the Sky\\" opens with floating synth chords fused with ethnic percussion samples and twinkling bell trees, but soon develops into a reflective piano tone poem enhanced with discrete use of synth strings and keyboard textures here and there. It is rhythmic and mysterious at the opening, and then becomes a much more ambient and free-form piano solo that floats among the clouds and mists of the sky until the rhythm re-enters, perhaps symbolizing gentle winds. \\"If I Could Fly\\" is an \\"upbeat and positive\\" four-minute blend of piano and synth with an \\"almost angelic chorus\\" providing some \\"colorful\\" vocal backgrounds. One Deep Breath closes with its title track and is \\"breathtaking in its subtle beauty\\"; it floats and meanders for more than ten minutes, bringing in ocean sounds. It is far and away the most ambient of everything else to be found here, and is \\"stunning\\", both in its execution and how radical a change it is from what has come before. Binkelman writes, \\"Fantastic Liquid Mind-like ultra lush synth washes serenely caress the air while muted background keyboard textures add soft 'coloring' (along with water sounds/waves crashing on the shore). As the lushness wears away, a simple pleasant drone courses underneath a sustained bell-tone, but after a brief music-less (just the waves) interlude, another ambient texture is introduced, spacier and yet also just as beautiful as the earlier passages (again reminiscent of Liquid Mind as those lush choral effects re-emerge). Another interlude with just waves occurs, followed by gentle sparkling high tone bells and lower register warm drones and synth chords. More melodic stretches of elegant synthesizer washes lends an air of contentment to the later stages of the track. As the song concludes, the music fades farther and farther into the background until only the sound of waves remains.\\". Parsons comments that One Deep Breath is an exceptionally good CD - especially if you enjoy structure as well as experimentation on one recording. \\"...All the songs are solid compositions and are performed with sincerity, grace, and an abundance of technique\\", cites Binkelman.

Rabbinical Work He was elected rabbi of the Neveh Shalom community of Spanish Jews in that city in 1553, and of the Livyat Hen congregation in 1560. He was eminent alike for knowledge of rabbinical matters and for scholarship in the science of his day, particularly natural physics and astronomy, furnishing commentaries upon many treatises translated from the Arabic and Latin. In 1565, he successfully represented his brethren at an audience with the sultan Selim II, petitioning for the confirmation of their civil rights. Contribution to Judaic Writings In 1570, Almosnino wrote a lengthy Hebrew commentary on the Biblical \\"Five scrolls\\"‚Äîthe books of Canticles, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, and Esther‚Äîunder the title Yede Mosheh (\\"The Hands of Moses\\"); also an exposition of the Talmudical treatise Abot \\"Ethics of the Fathers\\" called Pirkei Moshe, published at Salonica in 1563; and a collection of sermons delivered upon various occasions, particularly funeral orations, entitled Meamme·∫ì. Koah (\\"Reenforcing Strength.\\") These were published in Hebrew by his son Simon, the expense being defrayed by two other sons, Abraham and Absalom. Another Hebrew work by Almosnino was Tefillah le-Mosheh (\\"The Prayer of Moses\\"), an apologetic work on the Pentateuch, published at Salonica in 1563, and republished at Cracow in 1598 and 1805. Almosnino also wrote a homiletic in Judaeo-Spanish, Regimiento de la Vida, which is written as a guide to his son about how one should live his life, treats among other things of the origin of good and evil, the influence of the stars, Providence, the moral life, education of children, and free will. To this was appended a chapter on \\"Dreams, Their Origin and True Nature,\\" written, as it is stated, at the request of Don Joseph Nasi, Duke of Naxos. The work was printed in Rashi script at the press of Joseph Jaabez, Salonica, 1564, and was republished at Venice in 1604, and at Salonica in 1729. An appendix of five pages contains a list of difficult Spanish words, occurring therein, translated into Hebrew. An edition in Spanish letters was published by Samuel Mendes de Sola and associates in Amsterdam, 1729, dedicated to Aaron David Pinto. This work is considered one of the rarest in the Spanish language. A historical work by Almosnino, Extremos y Grandezas de Constantinopla, also in Spanish with Hebrew characters, was transliterated and republished by Jacob Cansino, Madrid, 1638. According to Moritz Steinschneider (Die Hebr√§ischen Uebersetzungen des Mittelalters und die Juden als Dolmetscher, p. 215), Moses Almosnino was also author of a commentary upon Aristotle's Ethics. Eliakim Carmoly (p. 12) mentions it under the title of Pene Mosheh (\\"The Face of Moses\\"), stating that it was written by Moses at Palestria near Salonica, and that his son Simon, after his father's death, desired to publish it (1584).

Born in Kiltormer, County Galway, Hayes first played competitive hurling in his youth. He made his first impression on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty he joined the Galway under-21 team. He made his senior debut during the 1979 championship. Hayes went on to play a key role for Galway for over a decade, and won three All-Ireland medals and two National Hurling League medals. A two-time All-Ireland-winning captain, Hayes was an All-Ireland runner-up on three occasions. As a member of the Connacht inter-provincial team for almost a decade, Hayes won four Railway Cup medal. At club level he is a one-time All-Ireland medallist with Kiltormer. In addition to this he also won two Connacht medals and three championship medals. Hayes also lined out with Glen Rovers. Throughout his career Hayes made 23 championship appearances for Galway. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 1990 championship. Hayes is widely regarded as one of Galway's greatest-ever club and inter-county hurlers. He has often been voted onto teams made up of the sport's greats, including at full-back on the Galway Hurling Team of the Millennium and on the All-Ireland Club Hurling Silver Jubilee Team. In retirement from playing, Hayes became involved in team management and coaching. During a four-year term as manager of the Galway senior hurlers, he guided the team to an All-Ireland final appearance. Playing career He won a Fitzgibbon Cup with University College Galway in 1977. Club Hayes joined the Kiltormer senior team as a non-playing sub in 1976, before making his championship debut the following year. He won his first championship medal that year following a 3‚Äì10 to 3‚Äì8 defeat of Athenry. In 1982 Hayes missed out on Kiltormer's next championship success, as he spent the year playing with Glen Rovers in Cork. Hayes was back with Kiltormer by 1990 when the club reached the club decider once again. An 0‚Äì18 to 2‚Äì7 defeat of Turloughmore gave him his second championship medal. He later won his first Connacht medal following a 5‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì6 trouncing of Oran. Kiltormer retained their Galway title in 1991, with Hayes winning a third and final championship medal following a 3‚Äì9 to 0‚Äì15 defeat of Athenry. He later added a second Connacht medal to his collection following a 2‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì6 defeat of Four Roads. On 29 March 1992 Hayes lined out with Kiltormer against Birr in the All- Ireland final. A 0‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì8 victory gave him an All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship medal. Inter-county Hayes first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Galway under-21 hurling team that reached the All-Ireland decider in 1978. Tipperary provided the opposition on that occasion, however, the game ended in a draw. At the second time of asking Galway emerged victorious by 3‚Äì15 to 2‚Äì8 and Hayes collected an All-Ireland Under-21 Hurling Championship medal. In 1979 Hayes was appointed captain of the Galway under-21 team. That year his side qualified for the All-Ireland final once again and, for the second consecutive year, Tipperary were the opponents. On this occasion Tipperary made no mistake and defeated Hayes's team by 2‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì9. Hayes made his senior championship debut with Galway on 1 July 1979 in a 1‚Äì23 to 3‚Äì10 defeat of Laois. Galway later shocked four-in-a- row hopefuls Cork in the All-Ireland semi-final and qualified for an All- Ireland final showdown with Kilkenny. In one of the worst All-Ireland finals of the decade, Galway goalkeeper S√©amus Shinnors had an absolute nightmare of a game. A 70-yards free by Liam \\"Chunky\\" O'Brien after just four minutes dipped, hit off Shinnors and ended up in the Galway net. Galway fought back and went two points up twelve minutes into the second half, however, they failed to score for the rest of the game. Four minutes before the end of the game another long-range free for Kilkenny ended up in the net behind Shinnors. It was a score which summed up the day for Hayes's side as Kilkenny went on to win by 2‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì8. In 1980 Galway defeated Kildare and Offaly to reach a second consecutive All-Ireland final. Munster champions Limerick provided the opposition on this occasion and an exciting championship decider followed. Bernie Forde and P. J. Molloy goals for Galway meant that the men from the west led by 2‚Äì7 to 1‚Äì5 at half-time. √âamonn Cregan single-handedly launched the Limerick counter-attack in the second-half. Over the course of the game he scored 2‚Äì7, including an overhead goal and a point in which he showed the ball to Hayes and nonchalantly drove the ball over the bar. It was not enough to stem the tide and Galway went on to win the game by 2‚Äì15 to 3‚Äì9. It was Galway's first All-Ireland title since 1923, with Hayes picking up a winners' medal and the celebrations surpassed anything ever seen in Croke Park. After missing the 1981 All-Ireland final, Hayes was restored to his usual full-back position by the time Galway reached the decider once again in 1985. Offaly provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland final and another tense game ensued. Once again it was Offaly's goal-scoring ability that proved crucial. Pat Cleary scored the first of the day after twenty-five minutes of play and got his second less than half a minute after the restart. Joe Dooley had a goal disallowed halfway through the second-half while a long Joe Cooney effort, which seemed to cross the goal line, was not given. P. J. Molloy was Galway's goal scorer, however, the day belonged to Offaly. A 2‚Äì11 to 1‚Äì12 score line resulted in defeat for Galway. Galway reached a second successive All-Ireland decider again in 1986. The men from the west were the red-hot favourites against an ageing Cork team, however, on the day a different story unfolded. Four Cork goals, one from John Fenton, two from Tom√°s Mulcahy and one from Kevin Hennessy, stymied the Galway attack and helped \\"the Rebels\\" to a 4‚Äì13 to 2‚Äì15 victory. In spite of the defeat Hayes was later presented with a first All-Star award. In 1987 Hayes was appointed captain of the Galway team. The year began well when he led the team to their first National Hurling League title in over a decade following a 3‚Äì12 to 3‚Äì10 defeat of Clare. Later that summer Galway qualified for a third All-Ireland final in-a-row. The prospect of becoming the first team to lose three consecutive championship deciders weighed heavily on the Galway team as Kilkenny provided the opposition. The game was not a classic by any standard and Noel Lane got a key goal for Galway nine minutes before the end. A 1‚Äì12 to 0‚Äì9 victory gave Hayes a second All-Ireland medal while he also had the honour of accepting the Liam MacCarthy Cup. A second All-Star award quickly followed. In 1988 Hayes was captain of the team for a second year. That year Galway reached a fourth successive All-Ireland final. After more than a decade-and-a-half in the wilderness Tipperary were back providing the opposition in the championship decider. Galway defeated Tipp in the semi-final the previous year, however, with an extra year's experience it was expected that Tipperary might shade the victory. Galway used this to motivate themselves. Noel Lane again scored the crucial goal for Galway while Nicky English sent a late penalty over the bar for a point. A 1‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì14 score line resulted in victory for Galway and a third All-Ireland medal for Hayes. Another solid performance at full-back resulted in a third successive All-Star award for the Galway captain. In 1989 Hayes was once again captain of the team as Galway went in search of a third All-Ireland title in-a-row. For the third time in as many years Tipperary faced Galway in the All-Ireland series, however, on this occasion the men from the West were controversially without their star player Tony Keady. The game turned out to be a tense and unsavory affair as Tipp finally triumphed over Galway. A 1‚Äì17 to 2‚Äì11 victory for the Munster men meant that Galway's three- in-a-row dream was over. Hayes played his last game for Galway in an All- Ireland quarter-final defeat of London in 1990. He was listed as a substitute for the subsequent All-Ireland decider against Cork. Shortly after half-time the westerners were up by seven points and were cruising to victory. Cork were a changed team in the second half and secured a 5‚Äì15 to 2‚Äì21 victory. This defeat brought the curtain down on Hayes's inter-county career. Inter- provincial Hayes also lined out with Connacht in the inter-provincial series of games and enjoyed much success. In 1979 Hayes was at centre-back as Connacht reached the inter-provincial decider. A 1‚Äì13 to 1‚Äì9 defeat by Leinster was the result on that occasion. Hayes was moved to full-back in 1980 as Connacht faced Railway Cup specialists Munster in the decider. A low- scoring game followed, however, a 1‚Äì5 to 0‚Äì7 victory gave Connacht their first Railway Cup title since 1947. It was Hayes's first winners' medal in the competition. Connacht reached the Railway Cup final again in 1983. A 0‚Äì10 to 1‚Äì5 victory gave Hayes his second Railway Cup medal, while the province retained the title for the first time in their history. After defeat to Munster in 1985, both sides renewed their rivalry in the inter-provincial decider again in 1986. A comprehensive 3‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì11 victory gave Hayes a third Railway Cup medal. In 1987 Hayes was captain of the Connacht team that faced Leinster in the final. A narrow 2‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì14 victory to Connacht. It was a fourth and final Railway Cup medal for Hayes, while he also had the honour of lifting the cup. Managerial career Galway On 11 December 2002, Hayes defeated incumbent Noel Lane, Brendan Lynskey and Gerry Fahy in a vote to become manager of the Galway senior hurling team. His first season in charge in 2003 was fruitless as Galway were out of contention very early for the National League exited the championship without reaching Croke Park. In 2004 Hayes secured his first silverware as manager. A 2‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì13 defeat of Waterford gave Galway the National Hurling League title. The subsequent championship campaign was once again unkind to Galway, who exited at an early stage. Hayes's two-year tenure as manager effectively ended following this defeat. A seven-man sub-committee of the Galway County Board later recommended Mattie Murphy for the job, however, Murphy withdrew his candidacy when club delegates voted 27‚Äì20 against his ratification as manager. Another candidate failed to emerge and Hayes was re-appointed for another year as manager. Following his reappointment as manager Hayes was under pressure to deliver. An unconvincing league campaign resulted in many expecting little of Galway in the subsequent championship campaign. A surprise 2‚Äì20 to 2‚Äì18 defeat of Tipperary in the All-Ireland quarter-final set up an All-Ireland semi-final meeting with Kilkenny. \\"The Cats\\" got off to a great start, however, the young Galway team fought back and exposed a poor defence to produce one of the games of the decade. A 5‚Äì18 to 4‚Äì18 victory gave Galway a place in the All-Ireland final against Cork. It was their first meeting at this stage of the championship since Hayes was an unused substitute in 1990. Cork's Ben O'Connor scored a goal in the sixteenth minute that gave his team a comfortable lead. Damien Hayes fought back with a Galway goal in the fiftieth minute, reducing Cork's lead to a point. Galway fell flat and didn't score in the last ten minutes as Cork won by 1‚Äì21 to 1‚Äì16. Hayes was persuaded to stay on as manager for another year, in the hope that his Galway team could go one better and claim the All-Ireland crown. After little success in the National League, Hayes's side exited the championship following a 2‚Äì22 to 3‚Äì14 defeat by Kilkenny in the All-Ireland quarter-final.

Women have traditionally created textiles in Maya society, and textiles were a significant form of ancient Maya art and religious beliefs. They were considered a prestige good that would distinguish the commoners from the elite. According to Brumfiel, some of the earliest weaving found in Mesoamerica can date back to around 1000-800 B.C.E. Materials Ancient Maya women had two natural types of cotton to work with, one white and the other light brown, called cuyuscate, both of which were commonly dyed. The preparation of cotton for spinning was very burdensome, as it had to be washed and picked clean of seeds. The cotton was usually associated with the elites. Elite women were also given the opportunity to work with the most expensive feathers and pearl beads. However, women of the elite not only had to prepare the best clothing for their families, but they also had to be talented in weaving tapestry, brocade, embroidery, and tie- dyeing for tribute to other families and rulers. Weavers had three different natural dyes to work with. Women also worked with maguey. This fiber was, \\"another commonly spun material, and depending on the species used and the number of production steps, it could produce either cluded human and animal hair (rabbit and dog), feathers, and vegetable fibers such as milkweed and chichicastle, a fibrous nettle native to Southern M√©xico, also known as mala mujer.\\" Maguey was of major value as a cordage material used for horse gear, nets, hammocks and bags. Until the nineteenth century, most dyed threads were naturally dyed but now in current times, Guatemalan weavers prefer and heavily rely on \\"commercial and handspun yarns dyed with mollusk dye.\\" As stated by Brumfiel, the use of these easier to acquire materials, \\"reduces the time needed for cloth production by two-thirds to three-quarters‚Ä¶, making it possible for weavers to devote more time to the actual weaving process\\" when using a backstrap loom. Instead focusing most of their time on creating the dyes and dyeing the cotton or maguey now, mollusk dye or acrylic thread threads speed-up the overall process. Another reason for using chemically dyed threads is because the, \\"colors are brighter and do not fade with wear, washing and exposure to the sun as readily as do naturally dyed threads.\\" Process In woven textiles, the first step is preparing fiber, which can come from plants, such as cotton or maguey, or animals, such as wool from sheep. In Mesoamerica, only plant fibers were used before European contact. The loose fibers are spun into threads by hand, with spindles, a long stick- like device for holding the thread, and whorls, a weight held on the spindle to increase its motion.\\"Spinning: From Fiber to Thread.\\" Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History. The Fabric of Mayan Life: An Exhibit of Textiles. Retrieved 7 March 2012. There were two kinds of looms used for weaving, \\"the foot loom and the back-strap loom. The latter is almost invariably used by women, who attach one end of the loom to a tree or post and fix the other end behind their lower back. For this reason the width of the textile is constrained by what the particular woman can manage. Until the fairly recent past, foot looms were operated mostly by men, but this practice is changing. The threads are made of cotton, although silk is frequently interwoven with cotton in textiles destined for ceremonial use.\\" After european contact Clothing made from animal skins began to be used by the elites. In the pre- Columbian era, Mayan women exclusively wove with backstrap looms, that use sticks and straps worn around one's waist to create tension. As written by Mahler: > The backstrap loom, in use before European contact and still used by some > weavers today, cannot even exist on its own without the support of a > convenient upright at one end and the weaver's body at the other. The weaver > controls the tension by the direction in which she moves her body, and opens > and closes the sheds in which weft threads are inserted by lifting heddles, > placing and rotating the wooden batten, and using other hand-held implements > as needed‚Ä¶ 'The loom itself appears to be a simple device. When the cloth is > completed, nothing remains of the loom except a pile of sticks', yet studies > of this technology have argued that it is really 'a complex device, more > responsive to the weaver's creative impulses than the modern treadle loom' > introduced into the region by the Spanish.Mahler, Joy. \\"Garments and > textiles of the Maya Lowlands.\\" Archaeology Of Southern Mesoamerica 2, > (n.d.): 362 After European contact, treadle looms were introduced, although backstrap looms continue to be popular.\\"Weaving: From Thread to Fabric.\\" Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History. The Fabric of Mayan Life: An Exhibit of Textiles. Retrieved 7 March 2012. There had to be specific bodily discipline, like stillness, balance and kneeling for a long time, in order to use the backstrap looms correctly which would end up defining, \\"the proper physical comportment for women.\\"Mahler, Joy. \\"Garments and textiles of the Maya Lowlands.\\" Archaeology Of Southern Mesoamerica 2, (n.d.): 363 Bone picks were used before contact and were unique in that they had different designs for most families and were usually passed on from generation to generation with the elite having the most expensive and beautiful.  Traditional pre-contact attire In the Maya civilization, a man's typical dress was a cotton breechcloth wrapped around his waist and sometimes a sleeveless shirt, either white or dyed in colours. In the twentieth century traditional male attire was characterized by some articles that were specific to a couple of towns, this included: a saco (wool jacket) or capixaij (tunic), pantalones (trousers), camisa (shirt), belt or banda (sash), and rodillera (wool hip cloth).Hearne, Pamela. \\"The Silent Language of Guatemalan Textiles.\\" Archaeology 38, no. 4 (1985): 56 A woman typically wore a traje, which combined a huipil and a corte, a woven wraparound skirt that reached her ankles.\\"Mayan Women's Dress.\\" Cultural Dress of the Maya. Adventure Learning Foundation. Retrieved 20 March 2012. \\"Mayan women traditionally wear traje, which is a combination of a skillfully woven, multicolored blouse called a huipil of a corte, a woven wraparound skirt that reaches to the ankles, and is held together by faja (sash) at the waist. Women also wear some form of headdress, such as pa√±uelo, on their heads, or cintas, four- or five-foot-long colorful ribbons that are braided into their shiny, long, black hair.\\" The traje was held together with a faja or sash worn at the waist. Both women and men wore sandals. When the weather was temperate, Mayan clothing was needed less as protection from the elements and more for personal adornment. Maya clerics and other dignitaries wore elaborate outfits with jewellery. Maya farmers wore minimal clothing. Men wore plain loincloths or a band of cloth winded around their waists. Some wore moccasins made of deerhide. Women possessed two items of clothing: a length of ornamented material with holes made for the arms and head, known as a kub. Both genders wore a heavier rectangle of cloth, as a manta, that functioned as an overwrap on cool days, and as blanket at night. The manta also served as a blind across the door. Huipil The most prevalent and influential aspect of women's clothing in ancient times is the huipil, which is still prominent in Guatemalan and Mexican culture today. The huipil is a loose rectangular garment with a hole in the middle for the head made from lightweight sheer cotton. The huipil is usually white with colorful cross-stripping and zigzag designs woven into the cloth using the brocade technique still commonly used today. The huipil could be worn loose or tucked into a skirt; this depends on the varying lengths of the huipil. Huipils often are used to display one's religion and/or community affiliation. Different communities tend to have different designs, colors, and lengths as well as particular huipils for ceremonial purposes. It was uncommon and often disgraceful to wear a huipil design from another community within one's village; although, it was a sign of respect to wear a community's huipil when visiting another village. Textiles produced by weavers within Mayan communities tend to have similar recognizable traits unique to that community, however, weavers are not restricted in their creativity. Instead the community design serves as an outline for what women should have, and then within the community design, weavers can implement a variety of personal details to create an individual finished product. One common theme is to express praise to different kiuggkes animals around the collar. Hair sash Jakaltek Maya backstrap loom. The hair sash is often the only part of the traditional outfit that is still locally woven by women on a backstrap loom. Each ethnic group not only has their own way of wearing the hair sash interlaced or wrapped around their long hair, but colours, motifs, widths, and the manner of setting up the loom and incorporating the geometric and figurative designs into the cloth are distinct. Elaborate hair sashes woven of finer thread with more complex imagery are worn on special occasions. Ideological aspects Classic Maya clothing displays its full variety in the context of religious performance. The deities themselves and their human impersonators were recognizable by their dress. A good example of this is the Tonsured Maize God, who wore a netted over-skirt consisting of green jade beads and a belt consisting of a large spondylus shell covering the loins, and who was repeatedly impersonated by the king as well as the queen.  Legislative Protection  In 2011, Efrain Asij, President of Guatemala's Commission for Culture, proposed legislative changes in favor of protecting textiles produced by indigenous communities. He touted the textiles' economic value to the women of these Mayan communities, as well as the cultural heritage represented in these designs. Asij stated that traditional woven Mayan designs are in danger of losing their cultural significance and economic value because of piracy and counterfeit production of Mayan garments. He calls for the creation of schools designed to create the next generation of Guatemalan weavers, in order to ensure that this ancient and sacred art continues to be valued. He also proposes that a study be conducted that would track sales of Mayan garments, specifically to locate problems of exploitation of their designs and how these designs are sold. Asij also proposed that Mayan communities be allowed to import their manufacturing equipment tax-free. Mayan communities could also purchase advertising, and export their textiles from Guatemala tax-free as well. All Departments of Guatemala's government are expected to promote and participate in the protection of traditional Mayan textile production. In 2016, legislative changes were presented to Guatemala's national government by the National Movement of Maya Weavers, a coalition of weavers from all over Guatemala. 30 Weaving Co-Operatives from 18 linguistic communities in Guatemala are supporting the movement which is led by the Women's Association for Development of Sacatepequez, known in its Spanish acronym as AFEDES. They argue that corporations have been exploiting their culture by mass-producing their designs which ultimately devalues and degrades their sacredness, and they are calling for revamped legislative protection that grants each Mayan community collective intellectual ownership of their traditional designs.  Current Day Textiles  In current day Mayan textiles, much has changed in the fields of design, technique, and materials. The Kaqchikel and K ºiche º are two specific ethnic-linguistic groups that still have strong weaving traditions. According to Schevill, \\"field studies reveal that many of the design decisions which a weaver must make in producing a garment are spontaneous. Often the only conscious decision made prior to beginning the weaving process is the selection of the colors for the background fabric.\\" Patterns would signify specific ethnic groups and social status but nowadays the patterns are less strict and more creativity filled. For other groups, \\"local tradition dictates at least the overall composition of garments. Although deviation from these aesthetic norms is not strictly forbidden, it does leave the weaver open to ridicule or gossip.\\" Apart from more freehand designs new materials are being introduced into the textiles. For example textiles now, \\"include the use of imported rickrack, ribbons, metallic threads, variegated embroidery floss, and velvet edgings on hand- loomed garments. All of these can be seen as inventive free-play on the part of the indigenous artist.\\" The Mayan women, weavers of textiles, are the ones who, for the most part, stick to tradition and wear the trajes. The Mayan men have declined in their usage of traditional mayan clothing mainly because they want to avoid ladino harassment while, \\"women‚Ä¶ continue to wear indigenous styles of clothing to symbolize their work of bearing and enculturating the next generation and thus perpetuating Mayan culture.\\" See also *Textiles of Oaxaca References Citations Bibliography  * Further reading Mahler, Joy. \\"Garments and textiles of the Maya Lowlands.\\" Archaeology Of Southern Mesoamerica 2, (n.d.): 581.

III, c. 53) was an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain, which repealed the Declaratory Act of 1719. The 1719 Act had declared the Parliament of Ireland dependent on the Parliament and Privy Council of Great Britain; the Repeal Act was the first part of the Constitution of 1782, which granted legislative independence to the Kingdom of Ireland. It was passed after the resignation of the North Ministry, which had overseen defeat in the American War of Independence. The Irish Patriot Party and Irish Volunteers had demanded greater autonomy, and the new Rockingham Ministry conceded in fear of an American-style revolt. The Irish Parliament subsequently passed Yelverton's Act to amend Poynings' Law, the Irish statute which had given the British (and before that the English) Privy Council advance oversight over legislation to be proposed to the Irish Parliament.Lecky 1913, pp.307‚Äì309 While Henry Grattan was satisfied with the 1782 repeal, Henry Flood demanded further that Britain positively renounce any right to legislate for Ireland; this was secured by the Irish Appeals Act 1783 (or \\"Renunciation Act\\").Lecky 1913, pp.332‚Äì333 References Sources *The Law & Working of the Constitution: Documents 1660-1914, ed.

Focused on product and process improvement, its purpose is to identify, correct, and eliminate recurring problems. It establishes a permanent corrective action based on statistical analysis of the problem and on the origin of the problem by determining the root causes. Although it originally comprised eight stages, or 'disciplines', it was later augmented by an initial planning stage. 8D follows the logic of the PDCA cycle. The disciplines are: :D0: Preparation and Emergency Response Actions: Plan for solving the problem and determine the prerequisites. Provide emergency response actions. :D1: Use a Team: Establish a team of people with product/process knowledge. Teammates provide new perspectives and different ideas when it comes to problem solving. :D2: Describe the Problem: Specify the problem by identifying in quantifiable terms the who, what, where, when, why, how, and how many (5W2H) for the problem. :D3: Develop Interim Containment Plan: Define and implement containment actions to isolate the problem from any customer. :D4: Determine and Verify Root Causes and Escape Points: Identify all applicable causes that could explain why the problem has occurred. Also identify why the problem was not noticed at the time it occurred. All causes shall be verified or proved. One can use five whys or Ishikawa diagrams to map causes against the effect or problem identified. :D5: Verify Permanent Corrections (PCs) for Problem that will resolve the problem for the customer: Using pre-production programs, quantitatively confirm that the selected correction will resolve the problem. (Verify that the correction will actually solve the problem). :D6: Define and Implement Corrective Actions: Define and implement the best corrective actions. Also, validate corrective actions with empirical evidence of improvement. :D7: Prevent Recurrence / System Problems: Modify the management systems, operation systems, practices, and procedures to prevent recurrence of this and similar problems. :D8: Congratulate the Main Contributors to your Team: Recognize the collective efforts of the team. The team needs to be formally thanked by the organization. 8Ds has become a standard in the automotive, assembly, and other industries that require a thorough structured problem-solving process using a team approach. Ford Motor Company's team-oriented problem solving The executives of the Powertrain Organization (transmissions, chassis, engines) wanted a methodology where teams (design engineering, manufacturing engineering, and production) could work on recurring chronic problems. In 1986, the assignment was given to develop a manual and a subsequent course that would achieve a new approach to solving identified engineering design and manufacturing problems. The manual for this methodology was documented and defined in Team Oriented Problem Solving (TOPS), first published in 1987. The manual and subsequent course material were piloted at Ford World Headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan. Ford refers to their current variant as G8D (Global 8D). The Ford 8Ds manual is extensive and covers chapter by chapter how to go about addressing, quantifying, and resolving engineering issues. It begins with a cross- functional team and concludes with a successful demonstrated resolution of the problem. Containment actions may or may not be needed based on where the problem occurred in the life cycle of the product. Usage Many disciplines are typically involved in the \\"8Ds\\" methodology. The tools used can be found in textbooks and reference materials used by quality assurance professionals. For example, an \\"Is/Is Not\\" worksheet is a common tool employed at D2, and Ishikawa, or \\"fishbone,\\" diagrams and \\"5-why analysis\\" are common tools employed at step D4. In the late 1990s, Ford developed a revised version of the 8D process that they call \\"Global 8D\\" (G8D), which is the current global standard for Ford and many other companies in the automotive supply chain. The major revisions to the process are as follows: * Addition of a D0 (D-Zero) step as a gateway to the process. At D0, the team documents the symptoms that initiated the effort along with any emergency response actions (ERAs) that were taken before formal initiation of the G8D. D0 also incorporates standard assessing questions meant to determine whether a full G8D is required. The assessing questions are meant to ensure that in a world of limited problem- solving resources, the efforts required for a full team-based problem-solving effort are limited to those problems that warrant these resources. * Addition of the notion of escape points to D4 through D6. An 'escape point' is the earliest control point in the control system following the root cause of a problem that should have detected that problem but failed to do so. The idea here is to consider not only the root cause, but also what went wrong with the control system in allowing this problem to escape. Global 8D requires the team to identify and verify an escape point at D4. Then, through D5 and D6, the process requires the team to choose, verify, implement, and validate permanent corrective actions to address the escape point. Recently, the 8D process has been employed significantly outside the auto industry. As part of lean initiatives and continuous-improvement processes it is employed extensively in the food manufacturing, health care, and high-tech manufacturing industries. Benefits The benefits of the 8D methodology include effective approaches to finding a root cause, developing proper actions to eliminate root causes, and implementing the permanent corrective action. The 8D methodology also helps to explore the control systems that allowed the problem to escape. The Escape Point is studied for the purpose of improving the ability of the Control System to detect the failure or cause when and if it should occur again. Finally the Prevention Loop explores the systems that permitted the condition that allowed the Failure and Cause Mechanism to exist in the first place. Prerequisites Requires training in the 8D problem-solving process as well as appropriate data collection and analysis tools such as Pareto charts, fishbone diagrams, and process maps. Problem solving tools The following tools can be used within 8D: * Ishikawa diagrams also known as cause-and-effect or fishbone diagrams * Pareto charts or Pareto diagrams * 5 Whys * 5W and 2H (who, what, where, when, why, how, how many or how much) * Statistical process control * Scatter plots * Design of experiments * Check sheet * Histograms * FMEA * Flowcharts or process maps Background of common corrective actions to dispose of nonconforming items The 8D methodology was first described in a Ford manual in 1987. The manual describes the eight-step methodology to address chronic product and process problems. The 8Ds included several concepts of effective problem solving, including taking corrective actions and containing nonconforming items. These two steps have been very common in most manufacturing facilities, including government and military installations. In 1974, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) released ‚ÄúMIL-STD 1520 Corrective Action and Disposition System for Nonconforming Material‚Äù. This 13 page standard defines establishing some corrective actions and then taking containment actions on nonconforming material or items. It is focused on inspection for defects and disposing of them. The basic idea of corrective actions and containment of defectives was officially abolished in 1995, but these concepts were also common to Ford Motor Company, a major supplier to the government in World War II. Corrective actions and containment of poor quality parts were part of the manual and course for the automotive industry and are well known to many companies. Ford's 60 page manual covers details associated with each step in their 8D problem solving manual and the actions to take to deal with identified problems. Military usage The exact history of the 8D method remains disputed as many publications and websites state that it originates from the US military. Indeed, MIL-STD-1520C http://www.everyspec.com/MIL-STD/MIL-STD-1500-1599/MIL- STD-1520C_NOTICE-2_23481/ outlines a set of requirements for their contractors on how they should organize themselves with respect to non-conforming materials. Developed in 1974 and cancelled in February 1995 as part of the Perry memo, you can compare it best to the ISO 9001 standard that currently exists as it expresses the same philosophy. The aforementioned military standard does outline some aspects that are in the 8D method, however, it does not provide the same structure that the 8D methodology offers. Taking into account the fact that the Ford Motor Company played an instrumental role in producing army vehicles during the Second World War and in the decades after, it could very well be the case that the MIL-STD-1520C stood as a model for today‚Äôs 8D method.8D Problem solving explained ‚Äì Turning operational failures into knowledge to drive your strategic and competitive advantages Relationship between 8D and FMEA FMEA (failure mode and effect analysis) is a tool generally used in the planning of product or process design. The relationships between 8D and FMEA are outlined below: # The problem statements and descriptions are sometimes linked between both documents. An 8D can utilize pre-brainstormed information from a FMEA to assist in looking for potential problems. # Possible causes in a FMEA can immediately be used to jump start 8D Fishbone or Ishikawa diagrams. Brainstorming information that is already known is not a good use of time or resources. # Data and brainstorming collected during an 8D can be placed into a FMEA for future planning of new product or process quality. This allows a FMEA to consider actual failures, occurring as failure modes and causes, becoming more effective and complete. # The design or process controls in a FMEA can be used in verifying the root cause and Permanent Corrective Action in an 8D. The FMEA and 8D should reconcile each failure and cause by cross documenting failure modes, problem statements and possible causes. Each FMEA can be used as a database of possible causes of failure as an 8D is developed.

It is a 24-hour emergency, inpatient medical, surgical and critical care facility that has been operating since 1976. It serves approximately 120,000 people in Dartmouth and the eastern Halifax Regional Municipality. It is located on Pleasant Street (Route 322) across from the Nova Scotia Hospital. It is operated by the Nova Scotia Health Authority. History The construction of the Dartmouth General Hospital was many decades in the making. On Natal Day in 1940, the town of Dartmouth launched fundraising efforts for a 50-bed hospital, which had reportedly been suggested 30 years earlier. A series of public meetings in 1942 were held in support of the project, and the Dartmouth Memorial Hospital Association continued to raise funds. Throughout the 1960s, various studies and consultations were completed on the future Dartmouth hospital considering aspects such as architectural styles, care requirements, locations, bed capacities, and technologies. In 1968, two proposed locations for the hospital were adjacent to the Nova Scotia Hospital in Woodside, or the old Dartmouth city dump which was at the top of Woodland Avenue. Ultimately, the Woodside location was chosen due to the steam plant the Nova Scotia Hospital already had in which the Dartmouth General Hospital would purchase steam on contract. The final design was set in 1974, which was a state-of-the-art expandable building that could support up to eight floors. The building was designed by Halifax architecture firm Fowler Bauld & Mitchell. During the 1970 provincial election, Dartmouth South incumbent MLA I.W. Akerley was defeated by Scott MacNutt, who campaigned on the promise of building a \\"long overdue\\" general hospital in Dartmouth. After his election, MacNutt was appointed health minister. In late 1973, a sod-turning ceremony for the new hospital was held. It was officiated over by MacNutt, the newly elected mayor Eileen Stubbs, and tourism minister Glen M. Bagnell. The 109-bed hospital (since expanded) was estimated to cost $5.4 million, but ended up costing about $11 million. The province paid 80 per cent while the City of Dartmouth paid 20 per cent. The Nova Scotia Hospital steam plant required a capacity upgrade to meet the demands of the new hospital which was completed in 1976. After the Dartmouth General Hospital opened in 1976, the old Dartmouth Emergency Hospital was shut down. The new hospital's emergency department began operations on July 7, 1976. The hospital was formally opened on January 14, 1977 by Nova Scotia premier Gerald Regan and Bagnell, who unveiled a memorial plaque in the building lobby. The first inpatient was admitted in March 1977. An intensive care unit was inaugurated in October 1979. Construction of a $5 million expansion to the hospital began in 1980. The expansion was completed in phases, with the first finishing in 1982 with the addition of three more operating rooms, totaling six, and more mechanical support equipment. The final phase was completed in 1986 which saw the addition of the other half to the fourth floor, a new dedicated intensive care unit, and the fifth floor. The fifth floor remained empty and unfinished until 2018. In August 1996, the hospital treated the cast and crew of the award-winning Titanic film after an angry crew member laced a serving of lobster chowder with the hallucinogenic drug phencyclidine (PCP). In 1999, the newly formed health district, Capital Health, gained control of the Dartmouth General and adjacent Nova Scotia Hospital. The two hospitals, although different in care missions, were subsequently merged in terms of budget and facility management. At the same time, construction of the new emergency department and day surgery commenced with construction completing in 2000. The former emergency department would be converted to outpatient clinics. The newly constructed day surgery department would not open until late 2004. In 2004, a new Renal Dialysis clinic was constructed, and opened in 2005. In 2015, responsibility for the hospital was transferred from Capital Health to the newly formed Nova Scotia Health Authority or NSHA. In late 2015, an announcement by the NSHA was made stating the Dartmouth General would undergo a $132 million expansion which would see the finishing of the fifth floor, a new four floor wing, new front entrance, revamped diagnostic imaging department, renovated renal dialysis, and new intensive care unit. The expansion on the new wing broke ground in summer of 2017, with the vacant fifth floor starting construction in spring of 2018. The completion date for all renovations and expansions is to be late 2020 or early 2021. The expansion is a part of the NSHAs QEII Next Generation project that has the goal to replace the Victoria General Hospital by expanding on the Dartmouth General, the Halifax Infirmary, and the construction of an outpatients clinic. The new expansion, named and dedicated to the former resident physician Dr. Neville J. Gilfoy, officially opened in December 2019. The addition features eight new operating rooms to replace the six original, a new day surgery department, new outpatient clinics, and a new sterile prep department.

J.\\" Haverty (1858 in Atlanta, Georgia‚ÄìOctober 18, 1939) was the founder of Haverty Furniture Co., headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. Biography Haverty was born in Atlanta in 1858, to the Irish immigrants Thomas and Margaret Cannon Haverty. Haverty also was a devout Catholic who was named a Knight of St. Gregory by Pope Pius XI and helped found the Cathedral of Christ the King in Atlanta. He began his first job, as a clerk for local dry goods merchant John Ryan, when he was fourteen. He also took Havertys public just before the stock market crash of 1929. In 1885, he started an emporium in downtown Atlanta with his brother, Charles. In 1889, he partnered with Amos G. Rhodes to start a law firm, which became known as Rhodes, Snook & Haverty after P. H. Snook joined it in 1894. In 1908, the Rhodes-Haverty partnership was dissolved, at which point Haverty founded the Havertys furniture company, along with his son, Clarence, and other business associates. He has been called the first \\"important collector of works of art\\" in Atlanta, with an eye for American Impressionist and Realist paintings, including work by Childe Hassam, Maria Turner, Albert P. Ryder, Jonas Lie and Henry O. Tanner. During the 1920s, he was a major supporter of New York's Grand Central Art Galleries, and he organized a series of successful exhibitions of American art at the Atlanta Biltmore Hotel. These events lead to the creation of Atlanta's High Museum of Art. Many Haverty collection paintings were donated posthumously to the High and remain in the museum's permanent collection. Haverty is buried, along with other family members, in Atlanta's Westview Cemetery.
