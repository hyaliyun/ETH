The 37 books in the series were written by Roland J. Green, Ray Nelson, and Manning Lee Stokes under the pseudonym \\"Jeffrey Lord\\".Fantastic Fiction entry for Jeffrey Lord The novels were also released as audio books, and as trilogy sets- each set having edited versions of 3 novels on 6 cassettes (running 9 hours, or approximately 3 hours per novel), and later on cds (1 per book, 3 per trilogy set), under the name \\"Richard Blade Journeys\\". These were released as Americana Audiobooks by Americana Publishing in English. Plot The novels were a series of adventures featuring the titular character (MI6A's special agent Richard Blade), who was teleported into a random alternate dimension at the beginning of each novel and forced to rely on his wits and strength. Along the way, he would have several explicitly described sexual encounters with beautiful women (both in England and in the alternate dimensions), and would usually return from his adventure with some item, or bit of knowledge useful to Britain (the ostensible reason for his being sent in the first place). Richard Blade was distinctly British, and all of the stories are set in England (at least at the beginning and end, with Blade‚Äôs being teleported to some other dimension for the bulk of each tale). The series was translated into several languages, including Russian, Swedish, French, German, and Greek.

It is currently used for light private aircraft. It was an all-weather temporary field built by the United States Army Air Force XII Engineer Command using a graded earth compacted surface, with a prefabricated hessian (burlap) surfacing known as PHS. PHS was made of an asphalt-impregnated jute which was rolled out over the compacted surface over a square mesh track (SMT) grid of wire joined in 3-inch squares. Pierced Steel Planking was also used for parking areas, as well as for dispersal sites, when it was available. In addition, tents were used for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with a drinkable water and minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting. Once completed it was turned over for use by the Twelfth Air Force 324th Fighter Group from 6 May until 6 June 1944 as a fighter base, flying P-40 Warhawks.

The 2000 edition of the work, written by Gifford but published shortly after his death, was a two- volume reference work, separating fiction (1895-1994) and non-fiction (1888-1994). The 1973 and 1986 editions were published as single volumes. In order to compile the first edition of the work, Gifford spent twenty years meticulously searching through back copies of trade newspapers and tracking down directors who had retired years before. The Catalogue was selected by the British Library's Curator of Moving Image as his choice in a Sight & Sound magazine shortlist of the best ever film books: \\"The nearest we have to a British national filmography was created not by any institute or university but by one man.\\" Along with the work of other early film archivists and chroniclers, Gifford's work in relation to the Film Catalogue was praised by Leslie Halliwell in the 1976 introduction to the first edition of Halliwell's Film Guide: \\"I salute especially the work of Leonard Maltin, James Robert Parish, Denis Gifford, Douglas Eames and the unsung anonymous heroes who compiled the reviews of the BFI's Monthly Film Bulletin during the fifties and sixties.\\" The work is a highly respected reference source in film history, recommended by the British Library and Yale University Library.

He was born in Bremen, Germany, the son of Hans Graf von Sponeck. He served as a UN Assistant Secretary-General and UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq. In 1957 he was one of the first conscientious objectors in the Federal Republic of Germany. Life Sponeck studied history, demography, and physical anthropology in Germany and the United States and joined the UN Development Program in 1968, working in Pakistan and elsewhere. In 1988, he was admitted to the Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg), the Protestant chivalric order to which his father, too, had belonged.Verzeichnis der Mitglieder der Balley Brandenburg des Ritterlichen Ordens St. Johannis vom Spital zu Jerusalem; Berlin: Johanitterorden, 2011; page 133. After Denis Halliday resigned as UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq in October 1998, Sponeck took over, heading all UN operations in Iraq and managing the Iraqi operations of the Oil-for-Food Programme. In February 2000, Sponeck and Jutta Burghardt, head of the UN World Food Programme in Iraq, both resigned for the same reason as Halliday, to protest against the Iraq sanctions policy of the UN. Sponeck and Halliday wrote an article in The Guardian explaining their position, accusing the sanctions regime of violating the Geneva Conventions and other international laws and causing the death of thousands of Iraqis. He was equally critical of the \\"smart sanctions\\" policy a couple of years later: \\"What is proposed at this point in fact amounts to a tightening of the rope around the neck of the average Iraqi citizen. The so-called 'new' sanction policy maintains the old bridgeheads of the current sanction regime: the oil escrow account remains with the UN, market-based foreign investment in Iraq will not be allowed and an oil-for-food program stays in the hands of the UN.\\" In June 2005 he served as an expert on the World Tribunal on Iraq, convened in the spirit of the Russell Tribunal. His earlier work as a resident representative in Pakistan and elsewhere, led to him becoming, like Halliday, a highly respected figure within the UN. After his resignation, he sought funds for his anti-sanctions work from firms seeking to do business with Iraq. His actions came under some scrutiny from the Paul Volcker Committee, which held that he had not broken any rule, but recommended tightening the rules. Sponeck was awarded the 2000 Coventry Peace Prize by Coventry Cathedral and the City of Coventry, the 2000 Humanitarian Award from the American-Arab Anti- Discrimination Committee and the 2003 Bremen Peace Award of the Threshold Foundation. He is a member of the World Future Council.

Renunciation of succession rights Several otherwise reliable sources mistakenly assert that Kamal el Dine Hussein held the position of heir during his father's three-year reign. In reality, Hussein Kamel had agreed with the British government upon his ascension to the throne to postpone the establishment of new rules of succession for the sultanate, meaning that the position of heir to the throne remained vacant. The succession issue was discussed between Hussein Kamel and British High Commissioner Henry McMahon in May 1915 in the wake of the failed assassination attempt against the sultan. Hussein Kamel preferred to be succeeded by his son Kamal el Dine, but also recommended his half-brother Ahmed Fouad and his cousin Youssef Kamal in case Kamal el Dine was unwilling to assume the position of heir. For his part, Kamal el Dine wrote a letter to his father in which he expressly and voluntarily renounced the succession. This was the only time in Egyptian history that an eligible heir gave up his rights to the throne of his own free will. On 21 September 1917, three weeks before Hussein Kamel's death, the British chose Ahmed Fouad as his successor. However, they first requested that Kamal el Dine make a formal renunciation of the throne, in order for the United Kingdom not to appear in the eyes of the Egyptian public as having deprived him of his legitimate rights. Although there were rumours that Kamel el Dine had declined the succession under the influence of his wife Nimet Allah (who did not recognize the legitimacy of her brother Abbas Hilmi II's dethronement), most historians explain his decision by his unwillingness to reign under a British protectorate which he strongly opposed. Others give more mundane reasons, pointing out that the prince asked to be relieved of responsibility in order to be able to pursue an exciting life of discovery and travel. Kamal el Dine Hussein was indeed an avid explorer, traveler and collector of oriental antiquities and works of art. In 1925 and 1926 he led expeditions to the Gilf Kebir, which he named.F. J. R.

Clayton, \\"The Western Side of the Gilf Kebir\\" Geographical Journal 81, 249-254 and 254-259, (1933) A famous reference to Kamal el Dine Hussein occurs in the opening pages of Nobel laureate Naguib Mahfouz's novel Palace Walk (1956), where one of the protagonists states: \\"What a fine man Prince Kamal al-Din Husayn is! Do you know what he did? He refused to ascend the throne of his late father so long as the British are in charge.\\" Rock monument at the foot of the Gilf Kebir Plateau A dedicated rock monument was erected at the Southwest corner of the Egyptian Western desert to commemorate Prince Kamal el Dine's explorations. At the time, the Egyptian Western desert was commonly referred to as the Libyan Sahara. Military career Educated at the Theresian Military Academy in Austria, Prince Kamal el Dine Hussein attained the rank of general and became the commander-in-chief of the Egyptian Army in 1914. Marriage Prince Kamal el Dine Hussein was married in Cairo on 5 May 1904 to Princess Nimet Allah (1881‚Äì1965), youngest daughter of Khedive Tewfik Pasha. The couple did not have any children.

The community uses the surname Siddiqui. A section of the Manihar may be Rajput converts to Islam. Present circumstances India Selling of glass bangles has been the traditional occupation of the Manihar. Some members of the community have now taken to other occupations, such as tailoring, others have opened shops, and many have taken formal education.

They are an endogamous community, and have a preference of cross - cousin and parallel cousin marriages. The Manihar are Sunni Hanafi Muslims and like other artisan communities in North India, have now become fairly orthodox. In Rajasthan, the Manihar are found in Jhunjhunu, Jaipur, Sikar, Churu and Ajmer districts. They are bangle makers and dealers in lac or sealing wax.

The original copies of these collections are permanently retained but are now in the process of being digitised. Some collections are now being uploaded onto the BBC Archives website on BBC Online for viewers to see. The archive is one of the largest broadcast archives in the world, with over 15 million items. Overview The BBC Archives encompass numerous different archives containing different materials produced or acquired by the BBC. The earliest material dates back to 1890 and now consists of 1 million hours of playable material, in addition to documents, photographs and equipment. The archives contain 15 million items on 60 miles of shelving spread over several sites. The stock is managed using a bar code system, which help to locate material on the shelves and also track material that has been lent out. The BBC says that the budget for managing, protecting and digitising the archive accounts for only a small part of the BBC's overall spend. The BBC is engaging in an ongoing project to digitise and preserve their entire archived programme material, migrating (transferring) recordings made on older analogue formats such as film, audio tape, videotape, Compact Disc (CD), vinyl, wax cylinders etc on to todays latest electronic formats as digital files, which are compatible with modern computer hardware and software equipment and systems. BBC Archives is constantly preserving, cataloguing and digitising its physical formats in order to safeguard material that is physically deteriorating for the future. Where their aim is to eventually create a complete digital archive where they no longer have to use now obsolete media formats and the respective equipment used for playing and migrating physical formats to other physical formats. The BBC can instead then to continue to preserve original master material in their secure vaults. BBC Archives has contingencies in place when digitising material so that digitised copies are not accidently overwritten, encrypted, deleted, incorrectly catalogued, incorrectly labelled and no more than one copy of each is digitised into the BBC Digital Archives. Much of the audio-visual material was originally recorded on formats which are now obsolete and incompatible with modern broadcast equipment due to the fact that the machines used to reproduce many formats are no longer being manufactured. Additionally, some film and audio formats are slowly disintegrating, and digitisation also serves as a digital preservation programme. The BBC Archive website was relaunched online in 2008 and has provided newly released historical material regularly since then. The BBC works in partnership with the British Film Institute (BFI), The National Archives and other partners in working with and using the materials. In 2012, BBC Archive Development produced a book - primarily aimed as BBC staff - titled 'BBC Archive Collections: What's In The Archive And How To Use Them'.‚Äú'BBC Archive Collections: What's In The Archives, And How To Use Them', Jake Berger This book describes the BBC's archive collections and offers guidance around on how items from the collections can be reused online. Buildings From 1963 to 2010, the majority of television material of nationally networked programmes in the BBC Archive were housed at the archive centre in Windmill Road, Brentford, in west London. Television programmes were also stored by the Open University in Milton Keynes, and by BBC nations and regional libraries around the country. In the late 1990s, and early in the 2000s material from the radio side of the BBC were also stored on the site. The condition of the three Windmill Road buildings deteriorated over the years and suffered occasional flooding incidents, and eventually the archive was relocated to a new centre at Perivale Park, Perivale, three miles north of the old site. The new BBC Archive Centre was opened in Summer 2010 and all material was successfully moved by March 2011. Material is stored in thirteen vaults, controlled to match the best climate for the material inside them, and named after a different BBC personality depending on the content contained in them. In addition to the vaults, new editing, preservation and workrooms have been added so that the material can easily be transferred between formats as well as viewed, restored and digitised for future posterity. The building has also been fitted with fire suppression systems to protect the archive in the event of an incident at the centre, so the total loss of the archive is avoided. As of April 2019, BBC Archives employs around 200 staff, most of whom are based at the Archive Centre in Perivale. Television Archive The BBC Television Archive contains over 1.5 million tape items as well as over 600,000 cans of film material. The archive itself holds extensive material from approximately the mid-1970s onwards, when important recordings at the broadcaster were retained for the future. Recordings from before this date are less comprehensively preserved; the process of telerecording was originally invented in 1947 while videotape recording was gradually introduced from the late 1950s onwards, but due to the expense of the tapes, recording was seen for production use only with recordings subsequently being wiped. or telerecordings being junked. The exceptions in the early years were usually occasions of great importance, such as the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. In addition, numerous programmes at the time were broadcast 'live' and so utilised no recording procedure in the production process. The earliest item in the collection is from 1936. Today, the majority of programmes are kept, including news, entertainment, drama and a selection of other long-running programmes such as quiz shows. The remaining material from the television archive is offered to the British Film Institute prior to being disposed of. Sound Archive The BBC Sound Archive contains the archived output from the BBC's radio output. Widespread recordings exist in the archive from the mid-1930s, when recording of programmes and speeches were kept for rebroadcast; the catalyst for this was the launch of the BBC Empire Service in 1932 and the subsequent rebroadcast of speeches from political leaders at a time convenient in the different time zones. Prior to this, the broadcast of recordings was seen as being false to the listener and was avoided. Any recordings made were frequently disposed of and it was the efforts of Marie Slocombe, who founded the Sound Archive in 1937 when she retained recordings of prominent figures in the country, that the archive became into being officially when she was appointed the Sounds Recording Librarian in 1941. Today, all of the BBC's radio output is recorded for re-use, with approximately 66% of output being preserved in the Archives; programmes involving guests or live performances from artists are kept whereas programmes in which the DJ plays commercially available music are only sampled and not kept entirely. Prior to any material being disposed of, the material is offered to the British Library Sound Archive. The archive consists of a number of different formats including wax cylinders, numerous gramophone records made from both shellac and vinyl as well as numerous more recordings on tape, CD and on digital audio tape (DAT). The difficulty of these different formats is the availability of the machines required to play them; some of the vinyl records in the archive are 16 inches in size and require large phonograph units to play, while the players for the wax cylinders and DATs are no longer in production. There are also 700,000 vinyl records, 180,000 78's records, 400,000 LP record and 350,000 Cd's in the archive. The Radio Digital Archive has been capturing radio programmes as broadcast quality wav files since 2008, with now over 1.5 million recordings growing daily. Some of the wax cylinder collection has been donated to the British Library. The Sound Archive is based at the new BBC Archive Centre in Perivale, along with the television archive, and was previously based at Windmill Road, Brentford. Written Archives The BBC Written Archives contain all the internal written documents and communications from the corporation from the launch in 1922 to the present day. Its collections shed light into the behind the scenes workings of the corporation and also elaborate on the difficulties of getting a television or radio programme to or off the air as the case may be. The archive guidelines state that access to files post-1980 is restricted due to the current nature of the files; the general exception to this rule are documents such as scripts and Programme as Broadcast records. The Written Archives are located at the BBC Written Archives Centre in Caversham, Berkshire, near Reading. The centre houses the archive on four and a half miles of shelving along with reading rooms. The centre is different from the other BBC Archives in that the centre opens for writers and academic researchers in higher education. Photographic Library The BBC Photographic Library is responsible for approximately 7 million images, dating back to 1922, created for publicity purposes and subsequently kept for future use. In addition to programme promotion, a large number of images are of historic events which are often incorporate into the daily news bulletins; as a result, half the photographic library team work specifically with these images. The images themselves are kept as originals in the archive, with digitisation only utilised when a specific image is required for use, when the image is sent in a digital format. Copies of images are also used in case any images are damaged, notable due to vinegar syndrome. The most popular images from the Archive include Colin Firth in Pride and Prejudice, Michael Parkinson interviewing Muhammad Ali, Martin Bashir interviewing Diana, Princess of Wales and a picture of Delia Derbyshire at work in the Radiophonic workshop at the BBC. Archive Treasure Hunt At the turn of the millennium, the BBC launched the BBC Archive Treasure Hunt, a public appeal to recover pre-1980s lost BBC radio and television productions. Original material of many programmes were lost due to the practice of wiping, because of the need to reduce costs, copyright issues and for technical reasons. The resolution of this appeal was that over one hundred productions were recovered including The Men from the Ministry, Something To Shout About, Man and Superman, The Doctor's Dilemma, I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again, Hancock's Half Hour, I'm Sorry, I Haven't A Clue and The Ronnie Corbett Thing in addition to recording sessions with Elton John, Ringo Starr and Paul Simon. In addition, the Peter Sellers Estate Collection donated numerous recordings featuring Peter Sellers. Creative Archive Licence The BBC together with the British Film Institute, the Open University, Channel 4 and Teachers' TV formed a collaboration, named the Creative Archive Licence Group, to create a copyright licence for the re- release of archived material. The Licence was a trial, launched in 2005, and notable for the re-release of part of the BBC News' archive and programmes made by the BBC Natural History Unit for creative use by the public. While artists and teachers were encouraged to use the content to create works of their own, the terms of the licence were restrictive compared to copyleft licences. Use of Creative Archive content for commercial, \\"endorsement, campaigning, defamatory or derogatory purposes\\" was forbidden, any derivative works were to be released under the same licence, and content was only to be used within the UK. The trial ended in 2006 following a review by the BBC Trust and works released under the licence were withdrawn. Voices from the Archives Voices from the Archives was a former BBC project, launched in partnership with BBC Four that provided free access to audio interviews with various notable people and professions from a variety of political, religious and social backgrounds. The website ceased to be updated in June 2005, and the concept was instead adopted by BBC Radio 4 as a collection of film interviews from various programmes. Heritage Collection The BBC Heritage Collection is the newest of the BBC Archives and holds a variety of historic broadcast technology, art, props and merchandise. The collection was created out of personal collections and bequeaths by former staff members, as the BBC had no formal policy on the heritage collection until c.2003. The collection includes, amongst other items, the BBC One Noddy Globe and clock, a BBC- Marconi Type A microphone, an early crystal radio made by the British Broadcasting Company, a Marconi/EMI camera used in the early BBC Television experiments, a BBC Micro computer and a selection of items used to create Foley. In addition to all the broadcast technology, art is also kept, namely the portraits of all the BBC Director Generals, as well as props including an original TARDIS from Doctor Who and the children's television puppet Gordon the Gopher. The heritage collection itself has no one permanent home, as the majority of objects are on display, either around BBC properties or on loan to museums or other collections; the most notable museum housing the collection is the National Science and Media Museum in Bradford. Programme Catalogue Over the years, the BBC has used various programme catalogue databases to keep a record of the programmes in the archives. Internal databases include Infax and Fabric, and publicly accessible databases include BBC Genome and BBC Programmes.

He also cares for the owner's daughter who is taken to Europe by an aunt. Two year later the woman returns from Europe with her new wealthy fianc√©e and plans to hold their wedding at the ranch, which the foreman has turned into a successful tourist destination. The foreman's feelings for the woman have not been diminished by the years, and after learning some damaging information about the fianc√©e, the foreman must find a way to stop the wedding. A print is preserved at the Museum of Modern Art, New York.The Library of Congress American Silent Feature Film Survival Catalog: The Lucky Horseshoe Plot Following the death of the owner of the Hunt ranch, foreman Tom Foster (Tom Mix) assumes responsibility for the property, taking also into his care Eleanor Hunt (Billie Dove), the beautiful daughter of the late owner. Although he falls in love with the girl, Tom is too diffident to express his feelings and propose marriage. Soon after, Eleanor is asked to accompany her aunt to Europe. Two years later, Eleanor returns from Europe with condescending airs, accompanied by Denman (Malcolm Waite), her wealthy European fianc√©e. Eleanor announces that she plans to hold the wedding at the ranch, which has been renovated by Tom and transformed into a successful tourist destination. Tom's friend, Mack (J. Farrell MacDonald), tells Tom about the rakish exploits of Don Juan, hoping to instill in him a bit of romance. Wanting to eliminate any competition, Denman instructs his men to kidnap Tom and keep him prisoner until after the wedding. Tom is knocked on the head and dreams that he is the fabled Juan, fighting like a lion for love. When he wakes up, Tom frees himself from his bonds and rides back to the ranch, where he arrives just in time to prevent the wedding. Afterwards, Tom and Eleanor are married.

As Don Juan, Tom awards the prize for beauty to Elvira Hunt, who appears as a charming Spanish girl. After fighting off and routing his enemies by leaping to a chandelier and then lunging across the great hall, Tom says to the girl, \\"Come, fair Eleanor; forget that despoiler, as you are mine.\\" She replies, \\"Oh, Don Juan, you are a man.

It is the first coral disease pathogen that is a protozoan as well as the first known to be a eucaryote; all others identified are bacteria. Like other members of the folliculinid family, H. corallasia is sessile and lives in a \\"house\\" called a lorica, into which the cell can retreat when disturbed. The mouth is flanked by a pair of wing-like projections that are fringed with polykinetids, groups of cilia that work in groups to produce a current that draws food into the \\"mouth\\". This species is so far the only known agent causing skeletal eroding band, the most common disease of corals in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and also found in the Red Sea. A very similar disease was later discovered in the Caribbean Sea, but is caused by a different species of the same genus and occurs in a different type of environment. Description Halofolliculina corallasia was first observed in reefs near Motupore Island in Bootless Inlet, Papua New Guinea in 1988, and named in 2001. The species name corallasia is a combination of \\"coral\\" and the Greek word lasios (ŒªŒ¨œÉŒπŒøœÇ), which means \\"densely overgrown\\". H. corallasia is a member of the ciliate group of protozoans. Ciliates are among the most complex of single-celled eukaryote organisms, distinguished by three characteristics. First, it reproduces both by cell division (splitting one cell into two) and by conjugation, in which two organisms temporarily join in order to swap DNA. Second, it has two cell nuclei. The larger, called the \\"macronucleus\\", carries out the normal work of the cell by transcribing DNA into RNA, which is used to control the cell's functions. The smaller \\"micronucleus\\" is used only for reproducing the organism by cell division and by conjugation. And third, it has cilia at some stage in its life cycle. Heterotrichs, which are among the largest protozoans, have a spiral of polykinetids around their \\"mouths\\". These are groups of cilia that work in groups to produce a current that draws food into the \\"mouth\\". Members of the heterotrich family Folliculinidae are sessile, enclosing the rear ends in a lorica (Latin for cuirass, flexible body armor) that is anchored to a surface, and into which the cells retract when disturbed. The mouth is flanked by a pair of wing-like projections that are fringed with polykinetids. H. corallasia is smaller than other members of the same genus, having a flask-shaped lorica typically 220 ¬µm long and 95 ¬µm wide, and \\"wings\\" that are 175 to 200 ¬µm long when fully extended. Its lorica, which is dark gray or black and made of a chitin-like substance, has flaps that close its opening when the cell is retracted. Skeletal Eroding Band Skeletal Eroding Band, the most common disease of corals in the Indian and Pacific Oceans and also found in the Red Sea, is the first recorded disease of corals that is caused by a protozoan, and the first caused by a eukaryote ‚Äì most are caused by bacteria. The disease is visible as a black band that slowly advances over corals, leaving dead coral in its wake. It is spread by cell division of Halofolliculina corallasia, which produces a pair of worm-like larvae that settle on undamaged coral just ahead of the black band. There each secretes its lorica, at the same spinning to produce the lorica's flask-like shape. This spinning, combined with the chemicals that harden the lorica, crumble the coral skeleton and kill the polyps. The discarded loricae of the \\"parent\\" H. corallasia cells remain, leaving a spotted region in the wake of the living black band. This distinguishes Skeletal Eroding Band from Black band disease, which leaves a completely white dead area behind it. H. corallasia is the first protozoan and the first eukaryote that is known to cause a disease in corals. A survey in the Caribbean Sea conducted in 2004 and published in 2006 reported a disease with very similar symptoms as SEB, affecting 25 species of coral within 6 families. Although the authors initially suspected H.corallasia, more detailed examination showed that the culprit was another species that was previously unknown and has not yet been formally named, although it is clearly a member of the same genus, Halofolliculina. A follow- up analysis noted that the Caribbean infestations were most common in oceanic waters, while those in the Indian and Pacific Oceans were more prevalent in coastal waters. Its authors therefore gave this new manifestation the name \\"Caribbean ciliate infection\\".

The band is most remembered for the song titled \\"Let it Loose\\", a track which made significant impact on the early 1980s metal scene (indeed, it was later covered by Metallica on their Whiskey Audition Tape demo), and would later give rise to the name of their first album, Loose 'N Lethal, released in 1983. History The group was formed in 1976 by 16-year-old bass player Chris Bradley, vocalist Chris Gent, guitarist Lee Statham and drummer Mick Percival, but after only one official gig the band disbanded and was re-formed in 1978 by Bradley, joined by Andy Bradbury on guitar, Simon Dawson on drums and his 15-year-old brother Andy Dawson on guitar. Line-up issues continued as Andy Bradbury was replaced by Wayne Renshaw, and Simon Dawson left to be replaced after a long period of searching by Dave Lindley. This was the line up that appeared on the compilation albums Scene of the Crime (featuring \\"Let it Loose\\"), Metal Fatigue and the double A-side single \\"Ain't No Fit Place\\" / \\"The China Run\\". Lindley left shortly after this as was replaced by Mark Brown of Tyrant (another Mansfield based band that had appeared on Scene of the Crime). In 1980, they released their first demo tape. In 1981, they managed to release Scene of the Crime and, what would be their most renowned song, \\"Let it Loose\\". The song incorporated a sound bordering on speed and thrash metal, and influenced many bands to follow similar styles. In 1982, Ebony Records picked up the band. Their first release under the Ebony label was a track for a compilation titled Metal Fatigue. The release was met with good reviews, so Savage decided to release a self- financed double A-side single through the Ebony label, which also sold well. Their debut album, Loose 'N Lethal was released the following year. Although being an impressive unit receiving compliments from magazines, fans, and bands, Savage lacked strong record label support. In 1984, the band decided to leave Ebony Records and signed to a new label, Zebra Records, part of Cherry Red Records. At the end of the year they issued their first release for Zebra, the 12\\" EP We Got the Edge. This was followed by what was considered a radically different sounding second album, Hyperactive, which although gaining great reviews, the band were unable to capitalise on due to a lack of support from management or record company. Frustrated, the band disbanded in 1986, resurfacing in 1995 at the request of fans during the height of Grunge releasing their third album Holy Wars, once again to critical acclaim. Albums followed in 1998, Babylon, and 2001, Xtreme Machine. A protracted hiatus then followed, fuelled by significant personal and family issues that were impacting all members of the band. The band resurfaced in 2011 with a new album Sons of Malice, again receiving significant critical acclaim with founding and driving members Chris Bradley and Andy Dawson, joined by Kris Bradley (Chris's son and Andys nephew) on guitar and Mark Nelson on drums. The band have returned to the festival circuit.

A trained architect and a presence on the science fiction scene during the 1970s, he became a professional in the comics genre with albums such as Galbar, and was allegedly the only artist to have obtained a steady income in this way during the communist period. A prolific contributor to Romanian children's magazines, Florea had his activity curbed by communist censorship when he first publicized his intention of emigrating to the United States. He eventually left the country shortly after the 1989 Revolution, and soon after began collaborating with Marvel, DC Comics and other leading enterprises in the field of comic book publishing. He became especially noted for his activities as an inker, with contributions on series such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Executioner, X-Men: The End, Batman R.I.P. and Batman: Battle for the Cowl. Florea has maintained enduring contacts with his native country, and has taken an initiative in popularizing the American comic book style in Romania. He has been described as one of the most successful among his colleagues, and claimed to be one of the most recognizable Romanians in his field. Biography Early life and career in Romania Scene from Galbar (1973) Born in Ghelari, Hunedoara County, Sandu Florea first became interested in comics while in fifth grade, his first contact with the medium being through a copy of the French youth magazine Pif Vaillant. Petrina Calabalic, \\"Cartoon Man\\" , in BƒÉnƒÉ≈£eanul, 6 December 2004 This encounter, he recalled in a 2004 interview, left him with \\"an impression that cannot be erased\\", and \\"the wish that I myself could draw such appealing and interesting characters.\\" Sandu Florea published his first comic strip in 1968, with Lumini≈£a children's magazine. It was a series centered on the anecdotal hero classic PƒÉcalƒÉ. Artistul Sandu Florea la Salonul European de BandƒÉ DesenatƒÉ, Romanian Cultural Institute release; retrieved 23 November 2011 In 1971, Florea graduated from Bucharest's Architectural College, and subsequently worked for a building design institute in his adoptive city of Timi»ôoara. Before graduation, he had also published his first work in the comics genre, inspired by the folkloric tale of PƒÉcalƒÉ, and featured in a 1968 issue of Lumini≈£a magazine. After moving to Timi»ôoara, he became a noted presence among the local science fiction fan base, joining the H. G. Wells Literary Club founded by writer Ovidiu ≈ûurianu. Their collaboration produced the 1973 Galbar, reportedly the first Romanian science fiction comic book. \\"Florea, Sandu\\", entry in Editura Nemira's Dic≈£ionar SF, 1999 (republished by Pro-Scris webzine); retrieved 16 August 2009 In 1975, he and Timi»ôoara native Marcel Luca published what is thought to be the first-ever Romanian coloring book with a science fiction subject, Vreau sƒÉ fiu cosmonaut (\\"I Want to be a Cosmonaut\\"), which reputedly sold 45,000 copies. By then, having received offers of collaboration from two publishing houses (Editura Ion CreangƒÉ and Editura Facla), Florea settled back in Bucharest and focused exclusively on his work in comics and illustration. Said to have been the most prolific comic book author active during the communist period, he had his work featured in almost all of the children's periodicals in print at the time. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, he was creating and publishing comic books dedicated to popular legends, such as a retake on Ion CreangƒÉ's fantasy story Harap Alb, or recounting episodes in Romanian history (involving Dacian rulers Burebista and Decebalus, Roman Emperor Trajan, Cosmin Popan, \\"Batman, omor√¢t √Æn complicitate cu un rom√¢n\\", in Cotidianul, 26 November 2008 and Wallachian Prince Michael the Brave).

Florea also received attention from celebrated poet Nichita StƒÉnescu, who discovered in ' an unclassifiable and imaginative work. The writer argued: \\"[Florea] introduces mystery where we usually had happy-endings, imagination where there was lyricism and an indecisive epic where there was nothing. The book he calls ' [...] is without precedent, in Romania and everywhere else.\\" D.

Florea printed the lithographs to go with the poems, but the project was cut short when StƒÉnescu died (December 1983). In the United States The 1984-1989 interval was described by Florea as \\"one of the most difficult periods in my life.\\" Having unsuccessfully demanded from communist authorities the right of leaving for the United States, where two of his siblings had already settled, Florea was exposed to political persecution, and the censorship apparatus lifted his right to publish, prompting him to contribute several comic strips under various pseudonyms. He returned to public attention after the 1989 Revolution, when he was briefly editor in chief of the new children's magazine '. With Fr√Ænculescu, he also founded another such publication, called Proteus. Sandu Florea, his wife and two children eventually left for the United States in 1991, moving to New York City and afterward settling in Long Island. Dodo Ni≈£ƒÉ, \\"Batman R.I.P.\\" , in Editura Nemira's Nautilus, March 2009 Although initially discouraged by the competition among comic book artists, Florea recounts, he decided to contact Marvel recruiters within three months of his arrival, submitting a sample of his take on Conan the Barbarian. According to his own statement, Conan proved compatible with his talents: \\"[he was] the only Marvel character who did not fly, did not breathe fire and did not use psychic waves to defeat his enemies, being instead armed with a giant sword and axe. Since I had been drawing many historical tales back in the old country, Conan was a character whom I could depict in drawing with relative ease.\\" He was accepted by Marvel soon after this, specialized as an inker, and began working on several of its main releases, including, alongside Conan, The Amazing Spider-Man and the various spin-offs of Avengers, Blackwulf, Elektra, Mighty Thor, Captain America, Doctor Strange, Fantastic Four and X-Men. He also worked with DC Comics (on Superman Second Series, Batman, Justice Society of America, Nightwing) and Dark Horse Comics, signing additional collaborations with Innovation Publishing, Vivid Comics (on The Executioner) and Chaos! Comics (Lady Death, Undertaker). Among the significant miniseries to which he contributed as an inker are X-Men: The End (2004‚Äì2006), Batman R.I.P. (2008), and Batman: Battle for the Cowl (2009). His work with Dark Horse included Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. His artistic production also touched other media: Florea created storyboards and other graphics for the motion picture producers Full Moon, as well as book illustrations for The Princeton Review. 2000s initiatives Florea looking over an aspiring artist's portfolio at the 2011 New York Comic Con. Florea was selected honorary president of the Romanian Association of Comic Book Fans in 2001. Speaking in 2004, he expressed interest in relaunching the native comic book genre in his native country, and in publishing a new children's periodical with original content. In 2006, he participated in the relaunch of ', in a version argued by HƒÉulicƒÉ to have been \\"professional under any definition.\\" Michael HƒÉulicƒÉ, \\"Fantasy & Science Fiction. Ah, BD!\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 315, April 2006 The publication, which went out of print after only two issues due to distribution problems, included Romanian-language reprints of American comics such as Conan the Barbarian and Aliens, alongside original collaborations between Florea and his Romanian colleagues: DouƒÉ palo≈üe (\\"Two Backswords\\", with Florea as artist and Gy√∂rgy Gy√∂rfi-De√°k as writer), Ultima frontierƒÉ (\\"The Final Frontier\\", text by Florea, Marian Mirescu and Eddie Pandele, drawings by Daniel Rizea and CƒÉtƒÉlin Gospodin), Toxic (text by Florea, drawings by Tudor Popa), Leviathan (written by Cristian LƒÉzƒÉrescu, illustrated by Florea). Michael HƒÉulicƒÉ, \\"Fantasy & Science Fiction. BD\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 273, June 2005 The magazine also featured Borderland, a comic series conceived especially for a Romanian public by writer John Warner and illustrated by Florea, depicting the confrontation between three worlds: of the Mortals, of Magic and of the Demons. Around the same time, Sandu Florea also began contributing to various Romanian webzines, such as Pro-Scris, Imagikon and Paradox‚Äîthe latter of which published his strip FortƒÉrea≈£a, based on a short story by Ovidiu BufnilƒÉ. Several aspects related to the artist's new Romanian ventures were however criticized by Michael HƒÉulicƒÉ. He argued that Toxic in particular was \\"weak and obvious\\", and noted that, in its featured edition, the text of Borderland evidenced its translator's poor command of the Romanian language. These initiatives helped cement the artist's reputation in Romania. Sandu Florea claims to be \\"The only Romanian professional graphic artist who has managed to make a living exclusively out of his drawings, in the old country as well as [...] in America.\\" Dodo Ni≈£ƒÉ, a historiographer of Romanian comics and Florea's colleague at ', placed √én lumea lui Harap Alb as fifth among an all- time chart of original Romanian works in the genre.

Biography Archia was born in Groveton, Texas, moving with his family as a child to Rockdale and then Baytown, near Houston. He played saxophone in the Wheatley High School orchestra. He was known in childhood as \\"Sonny\\", but took the name \\"Tom\\" when he decided that neither \\"Ernest\\" nor \\"Alvin\\" were appropriate for a musician. After graduating from Prairie View A&M; University in 1939, he joined Milt Larkin's band which, at the time, according to Down Beat, also included Eddie Vinson, Arnett Cobb, and Illinois Jacquet in the reed section and Cedric Haywood as pianist and arranger. Archia arrived in Chicago as a member of Larkin's band, which took up a nine-month residency backing T-Bone Walker at the Rhumboogie Club from August 1942 to May 1943.Campbell, Robert L.; Bukowski, Leonard J. and B√ºttner, Armin \\"The Tom Archia Discography\\" In November 1943, he was a member of the Roy Eldridge orchestra that recorded in Chicago for the Brunswick label. Other band members included Ike Quebec, Ted Sturgis, and Doc West. He moved to the Rhumboogie \\"Dream Band,\\" which lasted from November 1943 to June 1944. Along with Charlie Parker, Archia frequently disrupted band discipline, so when Marl Young took over as bandleader, his first act was to fire Archia. In 1945 Tom Archia went to Los Angeles to join Howard McGhee's combo, with Teddy Edwards, Bob \\"Dingbod\\" Kesterson, among others. Shortly afterwards, he was recording with the Jacquet brothers, Illinois and Russell, as well as Helen Humes. Returning to Chicago in 1946, he became a headliner at Leonard Chess's club, the Macomba Lounge, and recorded extensively for Aristocrat Records, the predecessor to Chess Records, during 1947 and 1948. He also recorded with Wynonie Harris and Hot Lips Page (on King Records).The Red Saunders Research Foundation He frequently participated in tenor saxophone duels with Buster Bennett, Gene Ammons, Claude McLin, and Hal Singer, among others. His run at the Macomba ended when the club was closed by a fire in 1950. Although Tom Archia worked steadily on the South Side of Chicago during the 1950s, and added Harold Ashby, Porter Kilbert and Lucius Washington to his roster of duelling partners, his recording opportunities were sparse and unheralded but included two sessions accompanying Dinah Washington. His last recording session was a blues jam organized by Jump Jackson in 1960 for visiting German critic Joachim-Ernst Berendt, who was touring the United States doing research on jazz history. Archia scuffled for gigs in the 1960s. He retired to Houston in 1967, after being temporarily disabled by a broken jaw. After recovering, he played Houston clubs for the rest of his life. He worked with Arnett Cobb in the Sonny Franklin Big Band,[ Chadbourne, Eugene at allmusic] which also included Joe Bridgewater and Don Wilkerson, with guest appearances by Clarence \\"Gatemouth\\" Brown and another old Larkin bandmate, Eddie \\"Cleanhead\\" Vinson. Many of the band's arrangements were by another Larkin alumnus, Cedric Haywood. Archia's died in 1977, aged 57, and was commemorated with a jazz funeral in Houston's Fifth Ward.

For this film Wilcox partnered her with the popular American singer Arthur Tracy. This drama musical romance features Arthur Tracy's street singing. The film's Dance Director was Ralph Reader.

Boddie, 26, is arrested for narcotics in Hampton on charges of distribution of marijuana and possession with intent to distribute outside Royal Suite, a nightclub. He gave Vick‚Äôs property address at 1915 Moonlight Road. Smithfield, Virginia (located in Surry County) as his residence. * April 25 - Police conducted a search of home and land at 1915 Moonlight Road in southeastern Surry County and discovered evidence of a possible dog fighting operation. Potential evidence included blood spatter on the second floor of one of the outbuildings, dog treadmills and scales, a pry bar used to open a dog's mouth and an apparatus used for breeding, known as a Rape Rack. With the help of animal control officials from several localities called to the scene, they removed 66 dogs, 55 of them pit bulls, and seized equipment and some physical evidence. * April 27 - ESPN reports that, even though Vick denies this, neighbors have reported seeing Vick in town from time to time and clerks at a nearby store have reported Vick buying nutritional supplies for dogs. Authorities told the news media that, although some equipment could be used in legitimate dog-breeding, there also was a \\"pry bar\\" used to pry apart a dog's jaws in dog fighting, and bloodstained carpeting on the floor of a room inside the home above the garage. :*Appearing at a news conference to announce his participation in the NFL Quarterback Challenge, Vick described himself as an unwitting victim of family. * Late April/early May - Vick listed the house and property with a real estate brokerage at approximately 50% of the assessed value. Within a few days, the house was under a sales contract. As of June 8, no sale had been made official, according to the county clerk's office where deeds and transfers of real estate are recorded. * May 3 - The Humane Society of the United States called upon the NFL in a letter to take a serious look at the problem of players' involvement with dog fighting. * May 24 - Poindexter said he still didn't have solid evidence linking Vick to dog fighting because there were no eyewitnesses who say they saw dog fighting at the home. He said he was proceeding very carefully with this case; Poindexter had another dog fighting case a few years back and lost it because of an illegal search. * May 25 - Poindexter said he was confident charges will be brought in the case but can't yet say who will be charged. * May 27 - ESPN reported that a confidential source, identified as a man who has been involved in dog fighting for over 30 years, claimed that Vick was one of the \\"heavyweights\\" in the dog fighting world, and was poised to tell ESPN's Outside the Lines about the time in 2000 when his dog squared off against a dog owned by Vick. The man claimed that Vick would bet large dollar amounts on fights, up to $40,000. * May 31 - Poindexter told ESPN that he recently received a call from a person he deemed credible and that the informant gave him information regarding the ongoing investigation. \\"We have people who are volunteering to make those allegations,\\" Poindexter said. Asked whether there was evidence that placed Vick at dog fights, Poindexter said, \\"Yes...If he did anything, he won't get away with it, if we can prove it. But it's not easy,\\" Poindexter said. ...\\"we're moving carefully, slowly...to build a strong case.\\" :*In the same news item, it was reported that ESPN's sources, said to be close to law enforcement, cautioned that, based on the current evidence, it might be difficult to successfully prosecute Vick. \\"There is probably enough there to bring a bill [of indictment],\\" one source said, \\"but how some of [the evidence] would play out at trial, or if it even reached a trial ... I just don't know. These kinds of prosecutions are tough. There are some holes, definitely, and that's why [investigators] are digging for more information. You want more than just smoke. You're always looking for the smoking gun.\\" * June 6 - Newport News Daily Press newspaper reported that Sheriff H.D. Brown had an investigator (deputy) interviewing additional witnesses who had come forward and determination of credibility was in progress. Brown, a 28-year veteran of law enforcement in Surry County, 16 years as sheriff, repeated prior statements that he felt pressure to rush, but \\"doing it right\\" was his priority. * June 7 - Boddie states in interviews with television and newspaper reporters that he was the victim of a conspiracy by authorities, and that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated by the search of the Surry property after his arrest on April 20 in Hampton (and another several days earlier in Newport News) because of the smaller amount of drugs he admits having [than claimed by authorities]. Speaking to the Newport News Daily Press, Boddie also apologized for his role in the dog fighting investigation. Boddie wants NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to know it was his fault, not his cousin's, for everything going on at the Surry County home. \\"I want him to know that everything going on is really my fault,\\" Boddie told the paper. \\"They're just making Michael look like something he's not. I want to apologize to Atlanta Falcons fans for what's going on. It's a lot of drama.\\" :*The same day, USA Today and WAVY-TV each reported the federal officials and Virginia State Police were executing a federal search warrant at the Surry County property, apparently seeking the buried bodies of dogs which may have been killed during dog fighting activities. * June 8 - Poindexter said he was \\"absolutely floored\\" that federal officials got involved, and that he believes he and Sheriff Brown handled the investigation properly. \\"What is foreign to me is the federal government getting into a dogfighting case,\\" Poindexter said. \\"I know it's been done, but what's driving this? Is it this boy's celebrity? Would they have done this if it wasn't Michael Vick?\\" He went on to say \\"There's a larger thing here, and it has nothing to do with any breach of protocol.\\" \\"There's something awful going on here. I don't know if it's racial. I don't know what it is.\\" :*Also on June 8, Boddie interview of June 7 published in Daily Press alleges he thinks conspiracy by authorities may date to when Vick's house was built in 2001. In the same article, local prosecutors from several jurisdictions disagreed with Boddie's contention that a smaller amount of marijuana he alleges he had during his April 20 arrest would have invalidated the search warrant executed on April 25. Boddie indicated that he had retained an attorney. However, no attorney appeared to be present as he admitted to reporters from the news media (television and print) his possession of narcotics, pledged his loyalty to cousin Vick, who he stated he has not recently spoken with directly, and denied any knowledge of the 66 dogs found at his home, with the exception of his French poodle. :*Contacted by the Daily Press, Hampton Senior Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney Anton Bell stated that dog fighting evidence turned up during the search following the narcotics arrest was obtained legitimately, a position Surry County prosecutor Poindexter had earlier taken. * June 15 - ESPN reports that the case investigation involving Vick‚Äôs property in Virginia is one of many investigations currently underway around the United States by the agents of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) using a new federal law enacted by the U.S. Congress earlier in 2007 making organizing a dog fight a felony. The agency is pursuing similar cases elsewhere with considerable support from humane societies and local police departments. So far, that new law has been used less than a dozen times; according to the ESPN attorney, as the courts apply it, more precise definitions of \\"sponsoring\\" and \\"promoting\\" will develop. .\\" * July 2 - Federal authorities file documents in U.S. District Court in Richmond outlining an alleged interstate dog fighting operation at the property owned by Vick, the Associated Press reported after filing an inquiry under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. Vick is not named in the documents, which listed the address of his property at 1915 Moonlight Road in Surry County as the \\"\\"main staging area for housing and training the pit bulls involved in the dog fighting venture,\\" according to the filings, which also claims \\"For the events, participants and dogs traveled from South Carolina, North Carolina, Maryland, New York, Texas and other states.\\" It is also alleged that \\"members of 'Bad Newz Kennels' also sponsored and exhibited fights in other parts of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland, New Jersey and other states,\\" the filings said. Unlawful gambling was also described, AP reported. The winning dog would win from \\"100's up to 1,000's of dollars,\\" and participants and spectators also would place bets on the fight. The federal papers also state \\"If an admission fee was charged for a particular event, the proceeds were generally used to supplement the funding of the 'Bad Newz Kennels' kennel operation.\\" * July 6 - Federal authorities, assisted by the Virginia State Police, conduct an additional search of the Surry County location. According to the Richmond Times-Dispatch, WAVY-TV (Portsmouth) was observing from a news helicopter, and reported that fifteen vehicles were on the property, including a rental truck and a Virginia State Police evidence collections truck. In a video broadcast, investigators could be seen working under a blue tarp on a wooded portion of the property near the black-painted outbuildings. They were sifting dirt collected in white buckets and clearing brush. Investigators removed more than 10 carcasses buried in shallow graves, a source close to the investigation said. \\"They found what they were looking for,\\" he said. :*The same day, according to information gathered by the NFL and Atlanta Falcons, sources told ESPN's Chris Mortensen that Vick is unlikely to be indicted on federal charges as a result of the dog fighting investigation. The authorities have told the Falcons and league that there has not been any evidence that tied to Vick the alleged dog fighting ring, the sources said. The law enforcement authorities have privately told league and team officials that at least three people are expected to be indicted but the identities of those individuals were unknown. * July 17 - Purnell A. Peace, Quanis L. Phillips, Tony Taylor, and Michael Vick were indicted by a federal grand jury for \\"conspiracy to travel in interstate commerce in aid of unlawful activities and to sponsor a dog in animal fighting venture\\". The federal grand jury alleged Peace, Phillips, Taylor and Vick spent six years \\"knowingly sponsoring and exhibiting in an animal fighting venture.\\" The grand jury also charged the men with establishing a kennel to represent dogfighting competitions, purchase and train pitbulls in dogfighting competitions and \\"destroying or otherwise disposing of dogs not selected to stay with the ongoing animal fighting venture.\\" The four codefendents each faces $350,000 in fines and six years in prison if convicted of the federal charges. :*The same day, the Humane Society of the United States called upon the NFL to suspend Vick under its disciplinary code. * July 18 - The U.S. District Court in Richmond announced that Purnell A. Peace, 35, of Virginia Beach; Quanis L. Phillips, 28, of Atlanta; and Tony Taylor, 34, of Hampton; and Michael Vick, 27, of Atlanta; have been ordered to appear in court on July 26 for a detention hearing and arraignment. * July 19 - U.S. Senator and Senate president pro tempore Robert Byrd, 89, (D-West Virginia), a well-known dog lover, gave a passionate speech in the U.S. Senate about the practice of dog fighting in response to the Vick indictment. text with audio :*The same day, Nike announced it has suspended plans to release a fifth Vick signature shoe. However, it has not terminated its contract with the quarterback. * July 20 - PETA staged protests outside the NFL headquarters in New York City calling for the firing of Michael Vick by the Atlanta Falcons and the NFL. More than 75 protesters attended, holding signs saying \\"NFL: Sack Vick\\" and chanting . :*The same day, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts said he had sent a letter to Goodell calling for Vick to be suspended. He wrote: * July 23 - About 50 people, organized by PETA, protest at the Atlanta Falcons training camp. The team had no comment on these protests, or others held recently at the NFL headquarters in New York City. :*Also on the same day, ESPN reported that Vick has retained the services of former federal prosecutor Billy Martin, an attorney with the Washington, D.C.-based legal firm Sutherland Asbill & Brennan LLP for his defense against the federal criminal charges. Martin joined the firm in February 2007. His notable past clients have included NBA stars Allen Iverson and Jayson Williams (who was acquitted of his most serious crime of shooting someone while drunk), Monica Lewinsky's mother, and Chandra Levy's parents. He also represented former Atlanta mayor Bill Campbell on racketeering, bribery and wire fraud charges; Campbell was convicted of three counts of tax fraud, but acquitted on racketeering charges and taking thousands of dollars in bribes. :*Also on July 23, it was reported that NFL commissioner Roger Goodell had sent Vick a letter ordering him not to report to the first Atlanta Falcons training camp. Goodell said in a letter to the quarterback: * July 24 - The Surry County grand jury met, but did not consider indictments as the local investigation continued. Sheriff Harold D. Brown stated he expects indictments to be returned during the September session for state charges relating to the dog fighting and animal cruelty investigation, but declined to be more specific regarding any names of person(s) likely to be indicted on those felony counts. * July 26 - Detention and arraignment hearings were held at U.S. District Court in Richmond for Peace, Phillips, Taylor and Vick. All four pleaded \\"not guilty\\" and a trial date was set for November 26. Defendants were released without bond, but with pre-trial conditions and direct court supervision. :*On the same day, federal prosecutors announced that they will file a superseding indictment, which could mean new charges and possibly new defendants in the case. * July 27 - Nike, Inc. announced it \\"has suspended Michael Vick's contract without pay, and will not sell any more Michael Vick product at Nike owned retail at this time.\\" The company said it had not terminated the contract, as animal-rights activists had urged. :*On the same day, Adidas announced its Reebok division (the official uniform provider for the league) would stop selling Vick football jerseys and the NFL said it had pulled all Vick-related items from NFLShop.com. * July 30 - Defendant Tony Taylor pleaded guilty to conspiracy to travel in interstate commerce in aid of unlawful activities and conspiring to sponsor a dog in an animal fighting venture in U.S. District Court. * July 31 - St. Louis-based sporting goods manufacturer Rawlings, which used Vick's likeness to sell merchandise and modeled a football using his name, ended its relationship. The same day, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Dick's Sporting Goods and Sports Authority have also stopped selling Vick- related goods. ** On the same day, WDBJ-TV News in Roanoke, Virginia reported that both prosecution and defense experts on criminal trial procedure have agreed that specific language included in Taylor's plea documents suggests that the federal prosecutors plan to bring racketeering charges under the RICO statutes. * August 6 - Grand Jury in Hampton, Virginia indicted Davon T. Boddie on the felony charges from his April 20 narcotics arrest. * August 14 - The Atlanta Journal Constitution, citing a \\"person with knowledge of the negotiations\\" reported that Vick's attorneys were seeking a plea deal with federal negotiators. * August 17 - Peace and Phillips plead guilty and entered plea agreements in U.S. District Court in Richmond. Phillips' bail was revoked due to failing a drug test. Peace's summary of facts reads in part: \\"All three participated in executing the dogs. Peace agrees and stipulates that these dogs all died as a result of the collective efforts of Peace, Phillips and Vick.\\" The Newport News Daily Press reported that because of the \\"victimization and execution of pit bull dogs\\" described in court filings, \\"upward departure\\" from the sentencing guidelines is \\"necessary in this case.\\" Judge Hudson told the men that the aggravating factors will be taken into consideration at sentencing, which means they could face harsher punishments at their sentencing, Peace and Phillips were told. :*Also on August 17, Surry County Commonwealth's Attorney Gerald Poindexter told WVEC-TV that the admissions contained in the federal plea agreements filed by Purnell Peace and Quanis Phillips were \\"a road map to indictments in Surry County.\\" Poindexter's looking at two felony counts: dogfighting and killing of a companion animal. The maximum sentence in Virginia for each charge is five years. \\"We believed we had evidence and this is the first time someone's admitted to it. It's sad and outrageous. It's gruesome.\\" he added. ESPN reported that Vick could face up to 40 years in prison under state law. * August 20 - Vick's lawyer Billy Martin announced that Vick will plead guilty to the federal felony dogfighting conspiracy charge. He will enter his plea before Judge Hudson on August 27 in Richmond. * August 24 - Vick signed a plea agreement admitting that he participated in and funded an inter-state dogfighting ring. His official statement maintains that he did not place any bets or take any prize money. :*That same day, the NFL suspended Vick indefinitely without pay. In a letter from NFL commissioner Roger Goodell addressed to Vick, Goodell wrote that Vick's admitted conduct was \\"not only illegal but also cruel and reprehensible.\\" Goodell also freed the Atlanta Falcons to \\"assert any claims or remedies\\" to recover $22 million of Vick's signing bonus from the 10-year, $130 million contract he signed in 2004. * August 27 - Vick submitted the guilt plea before Judge Hudson. Sentencing was set for December 10. * September 25 - Vick is indicted in the state of Virginia by the Surry County grand jury on two charges: one count of unlawfully torturing and killing dogs and one of promoting dogfights. Each is a felony charge that could result in a five-year prison term. * September 26 - Vick fails a court ordered drug test drawn on September 13 for illegal substances (he tests positive for marijuana) and as a result is ordered by US Federal Judge Henry E. Hudson to \\"submit to any method of testing required by the pretrial services officer or the supervising officer for determining whether the defendant is using a prohibited substance.\\" He must also participate in substance abuse therapy and mental health counseling \\"if deemed advisable by the pretrial services officer or supervising officer\\" at his own expense, the order said. In addition, Vick is now subject to a curfew from 10:00PM to 6:00AM and may be subject to electronic monitoring as part of his pre-sentencing release. * November 30 - Peace and Phillips are sentenced to federal prison terms which exceed federal guidelines and the plea agreement recommendations of prosecutors. An attorney for one argues that Taylor and Vick had greater roles. * December 10 - Vick is sentenced to 23 months in prison for the investigation and dogfighting charges by Henry E. Hudson. He can get up to 3 months off his sentence for good behavior.

Its flaired hip roof and stone-and-stucco siding differentiate it from the many gabled, and often half-timbered, bungalows built during the 1920s. The architect was Thomas Gill (the father of Thomas P. Gill), who designed the Oahu Country Club building and many residences in Honolulu between 1899 and 1941. . The house was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Thomas Alexander Burningham was an employee of a number of prominent local businesses: Von Hamm-Young, Castle & Cooke, Honolulu Iron Works, and Inter-Island Steam Navigation Company. Upon his death, the property passed to his nephew, George L. Burningham, who also worked at Inter-Island Steam Navigation Company. The one-story, rectangular house is more substantial than many a bungalow, with a large living room with Chinese-style lights, three bedrooms separated by both screen and solid doors, and a hall leading to the kitchen and pantry. It also has a central vacuum system and a basement. The fine craftsmanship can be seen in its parquet floors, built-in furniture, and stained-glass windows. The lava rock used for the foundation, support piers, and texture in the stucco also show commitment to the use of local materials. However, the leaded glass for the windows and the glazed brick for the fireplace both came from Australia, and the beveled glass in the bifold doors to the lƒÅnais came from France.

The poem is characterised by its reliance on short lines which alternate in rhyme and meter to prevent a felicitous feel. In the poem, Tennyson uses the image of a dark house as a metaphor for a dead body Background \\"The Deserted House\\" was printed along with other poems of Tennyson's juvenilia in his collection, Poems, Chiefly Lyrical of 1830. The poem was printed alongside works that included \\"The Dying Swan\\", \\"The Mystic\\", \\"Ode to Memory\\", \\"The Sleeping Beauty\\", and the later suppressed poem, \\"The Grasshopper\\".Hill 1971 pp. 530‚Äì539 Poem The poem exhibits lyrical economy with its reliance on short lines. The lines themselves alternate in rhyme and meter in a manner that keeps the poem from having a felicitous feel to it.Thomson 1986 p. 22 The first four stanzas of the poem describe the emptiness of a house, while the fifth, final stanza reveals that the empty house is a metaphor for a dead body after the soul has left.Joseph 1992 p. 33 :Life and Thought have gone away :Side by side, :Leaving door and windows wide: :Careless tenants they! :All within is dark as night: :In the windows is no light: :And no murmur at the door, :So frequent on its hinge before. :Close the door, the shutters close, :Or thro' the windows we shall see :The nakedness and vacancy :Of the dark deserted house. :Come away: no more of mirth :Is here or merry-making sound. :The house was builded of the earth, :And shall fall again to ground. :Come away: for Life and Thought :Here no longer dwell; :But in a city glorious‚Äî :A great and distant city‚Äîhave bought :A mansion incorruptible. :Would they could have stayed with us. Themes Tennyson's use of allegory in \\"The Deserted House\\" established a method that he later developed into \\"parabolic drift\\", the term he used to describe his metaphoric style in Idylls of the King. The specific allegory, the use of a dark house as a metaphor for a dead body, reappears in the seventh part of Tennyson's In Memoriam; the Hallam house represents the narrator's dead friend, Arthur. Throughout Tennyson's poetry, the mood of a poem is transmitted through the scenery. To Tennyson, empty space represented the remoteness of an individual, and this theme appears in many of his works including The Lady of Shalott in the form of a quiet island and in Oenone as a quiet valley. In Mariana, the landscape is isolated and brooding, which reflects on her solitude, but the noises of the scene fill it with the life that is lacking in \\"The Deserted House\\".Joseph 1992 pp. 32‚Äì34 In many of Tennyson's works, he connected the idea of God to a dying civilisation. Before \\"The Deserted House\\", the image appears in \\"Babylon\\", \\"The Fall of Jerusalem\\", \\"Persia\\", and \\"Timbuctoo\\". Although the theme is different in \\"The Deserted House\\", the poem still describes a decaying body that is present with the narrator while an incorruptible house exists in a distant location.Goslee 1989 p. 23 Out of a possible response to Tennyson's death, Evelyn De Morgan painted Life and Thought Have Gone Away, a work that is based on \\"The Deserted House\\". With the painting, she excerpted part of the poem dealing with \\"Life\\" and \\"Thought\\", two ideas that she personified in her artwork. Her depiction of Life is one that is in action, wearing armour, and carries a spear, while Thought is a female in thought, wearing a robe and carrying a book. The actual house, in De Morgan's interpretation, was a sepulcher. In the background of her work is a depiction of a city with angels along a path that leads towards it. Another aspect of the painting is the depiction of the soul leaving the body and travelling to the afterlife. She added a fig tree as a possible representation of original sin or as a representation of a path towards paradise.Smith 2002 p. 165 Critical response An anonymous review in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine for May 1832 argues, \\"Mr Tennyson, when he chooses, can say much in few words. A fine example of that is shewn in five few-syllabled four-lined stanzas on a Deserted House. Every word tells; and the short whole is most pathetic in its completeness-let us say perfection- like some old Scottish air sung by maiden at her wheel-or shepherd in the wilderness.\\"Anonymous 1832 p. 733 Walt Whitman characterises Tennyson's works saying, \\"There is such a latent charm in mere words, cunning collocutions, and in the voice ringing them, which he has caught, and brought out beyond all others [...] evidenced in The Lady of Shalott, The Deserted House, and many other pieces.\\"Walters 1893 quoted p. 201 In describing the poem, an anonymous review in the 1884 Sunday Magazine says \\"Beautiful it was in art, music, and imagination; but there was something more than a general expression of awe about it.\\" William Dawson, in his 1890 review of English poets, included \\"The Deserted House\\" in poems of Tennyson that represented his \\"fineness of workmanship and depth of feeling\\".Dawson 1890 pp. 170‚Äì171 Later in 1899, Stephen Gwynn argues, \\"Even among the Juvenilia, The Deserted House is not easy to forget\\".Gwynn 1899 p. 147‚Äì148 Notes References *Anonymous. \\"Tennyson's Poems\\", Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine.

He was considered \\"Chicago's top labor racketeer\\" in the 1950s. One high-ranking Chicago Teamsters leader noted in 1954, \\"He is the mob. When he opens his mouth, it's the syndicate talking\\". Glimco was active in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) and a close associate of Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa. He was a capo in the Chicago Outfit, an organized crime syndicate, and oversaw the wisyndicate's labor racketeering efforts. He worked closely with Tony \\"Joe Batters\\" Accardo, who led the Chicago Outfit from 1943 to 1957, and Sam \\"Momo\\" Giancana, who led the syndicate from 1957 to 1966. A United States Senate committee once claimed that Glimco ran \\"the nation's most corrupt union\\". Among his numerous aliases were Joey Glimco, Tough Guy Glimco, Joseph Glinico, Joseph Glielmi, and Giuseppe Primavera. He was also known as \\"Little Tim Murphy\\", a reference to Timothy \\"Big Tim\\" Murphy, a Chicago mobster and labor racketeer (also well known for his close ties to the Teamsters) whom the Chicago Outfit feared and subsequently murdered in 1928. Early life Glimco was born Giuseppe Glielmi in Puglietta, a frazione of the town of Campagna in the Province of Salerno, Campania in Italy, in 1909, and emigrated to the United States with his family in 1913, settling in Chicago. He had two brothers, including Frank, and a sister. Glimco attended public school but quit after the seventh grade to earn a living as a shoeshiner and newspaper delivery boy. He owned two newsstands when he was 20 years old. Glimco's criminal career began about the same time as his departure from school. By the time he was 18, he had been arrested five times and convicted twice for disorderly conduct and once for larceny (receiving six months to a year's probation each time). By the time he was 25, he had been arrested another 16 times‚Äîincluding arrests for murder (twice), bootlegging (twice), motor vehicle theft, criminal intimidation, bombing, and public brawling. In 1932, he married Lena Pierini, an Italian-American woman, and they had a son; Joseph Jr., and a daughter, Jo Anne Kosey. His brother Frank married Dona Alex, the sister of Gus Alex, a hitman for Chicago Outfit financial and legal advisor Jake \\"Greasy Thumb\\" Guzik (who oversaw the Outfit's bribes to police and politicians and ensured that income due to the Outfit was not skimmed by lower level mobsters). Around the time of his marriage, Glimco became an associate of important Chicago Outfit leaders Tony Accardo and Louis \\"Little New York\\" Campagna. Campagna became Glimco's \\"mob patron\\", helping to guide his decisions and actions and keep him out of law enforcement trouble. Glimco applied to become a naturalized U.S. citizen in November 1931, but his application was turned down in November 1932 due to his extensive criminal record. He applied again in June 1938, and was denied for the same reasons in July 1939. He applied a final time in 1940, and his petition was approved in 1943. Organized crime and labor activities Glimco had an extensive career as a labor racketeer in the 1930s. By 1930, he had become an established \\"labor slugger\\", assaulting or threatening to assault union members or employers in order to help organized crime gain control of labor unions. One of his chief soldiers was Dominic Senese. Probably his first assignment was to help the Chicago Outfit run the Commission Drivers Union, IBT. Soon thereafter, Glimco became a prot√©g√© of William J. \\"Witt\\" Hanley, secretary-treasurer of the Produce, Fresh & Frozen Fruits & Vegetables, Fish, Butter, Eggs, Cheese & Poultry Drivers Union, Local 703, IBT. Hanley had strong mob ties, and Local 703 president William \\"Klondike\\" O'Donnell was a notorious gangster. Glimco became the \\"office manager\\" for the Poultry Handlers Union, IBT, in 1933, organizer for the Poultry Handlers in 1937, and later an organizer for the Poultry Drivers and the Fish Handlers & Filleters unions as well. Both locals were part of the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen national union. Among his frequent associates were a number of other labor leaders and staff with strong ties to organized crime. Glimco was overseeing the extortion of the city's Fulton Street and Randolph Street poultry dealers by 1934, and two years later was such a prominent labor racketeer that the Chicago Tribune named him one of Al Capone's chief soldiers. After Capone went to prison in 1931, Glimco openly associated with the titular head of the Chicago mob, Frank Nitti (a relationship that only ended with Nitti's suicide in 1943). In 1940, Hanley brought Glimco to see Dominic Abata, founder of the taxi drivers' division of Local 777, IBT (which represented many Chicago taxicab drivers). Hanley told Abata to put Glimco on the payroll; intimidated, Abata made Glimco the division's executive director. After Hanley's death in 1944, Glimco began to take over a larger number of the labor rackets in Chicago. He also started to exercise more active control of Taxi Drivers Local 777 as well as the Produce Drivers union. In 1944, Glimco was elected secretary-treasurer of Local 777, and in 1950 became the local's sole pension and welfare fund trustee. Growing Teamsters connections and mob influence Glimco's influence spread within the mob and the Chicago labor movement beginning in 1950. That year, Glimco made a strong push to take over the Chicago Federation of Labor, terrorizing influential local labor leaders with repeated bombings and drive-by shootings. Glimco forced Abata out of Local 777 in 1951 by making death threats against him, his wife, and his children, replaced him with cab driver Joe Coca, and in 1952 was employed by the local as a negotiator. He was also elected a delegate to the Chicago Federation of Labor, the Illinois Federation of Labor, and Teamsters Joint Council of Chicago. Through most of the 1950s Glimco was considered \\"Chicago's top labor racketeer\\". One top Chicago Teamsters leader noted in 1954, \\"He is the mob. When he opens his mouth, it's the syndicate talking\\". Federal law enforcement officials, who had been investigating Glimco since 1943, agreed: \\"We are investigating Glimco because he represents the syndicate\\". Glimco attended a meeting of top Chicago Outfit leaders at the home of Tony Accardo in April 1952, and a meeting of the Outfit's top labor racketeers at the home of Murray \\"The Camel\\" Humphreys (who supervised the Outfit's labor activities) in 1953. Humphreys was pushed out of active involvement in most organized crime activities in 1954 due to failing eyesight, and Glimco was named his successor. The Chicago Crime Commission estimated Glimaco's income from union salaries, businesses, kickbacks, and extortion payoffs to be $70,000 a month after this takeover. His legitimate business interests (many of which began in 1952) included a chemical company, several laundries, a phonograph record distributor, and a number of jukebox leasing firms. Glimco was also wielded increasing power in the Teamsters union. In 1952, he switched sides and threw the support of a large block of Chicago delegates' votes behind the candidacy of Dave Beck, who was challenging incumbent Teamsters President Daniel Tobin for the union's presidency. The following year, Glimco‚Äîcontrolling about 25 percent of the votes in the race for the Teamsters Joint Council of Chicago‚Äîorchestrated the defeat of the incumbent president and his slate of three council members and installed his own candidates in office. Glimco's support of Beck was not strong, however. Glimco began supporting up-and-coming Teamsters official Jimmy Hoffa in the late 1940s. Hoffa was expanding his political base within the Teamsters in preparation for an attempt to unseat incumbent Teamsters President Dave Beck. Hoffa needed to control the delegate- rich locals in Chicago, and to do that he needed Glimco's permission to infiltrate and dominate them. Through his relationship with Paul \\"Red\\" Dorfman, president of the Chicago Waste Handlers Union and an associate of Tony Accardo's,; Hoffa became a close friend to Glimco and Paul \\"The Waiter\\" Ricca. Glimco brokered the deal in which the Chicago Outfit supported Hoffa's organizing drives among Midwestern drivers in exchange for Glimco's access to Local 777's finances. Glimco's actions positioned him to support either man: If Beck won, Glimco's actions in 1952 proved his allegiance to Beck. If Hoffa won, Glimco would have played a critical role in his success. Legal troubles Glimco began having legal troubles in 1954. Law enforcement officials first tried to connect him with the slaying of Charles \\"Cherry Nose\\" Gioe on August 19, 1954. According to police, Glimco had allegedly ordered the bombing of a Howard Johnson's restaurant at 4240 North Harlem Avenue in Norridge, Illinois, on May 18, 1954, in an attempt to force the construction contractor to employ union labor (specifically, a labor union dominated by Glimco). Gioe, a top Chicago Outfit underboss recently released from prison, ordered Glimco to end his dispute with the contractor and Glimco allegedly had Gioe murdered for this interference in his business.; But the investigation ended without any action taken against Glimco. The Gioe investigation led to a major press expose and additional legal actions against Glimco. On August 30, 1954, the Chicago Daily Tribune began running a six-part series exposing Glimco's criminal past, mob ties, and infiltration of the Chicago labor movement. \\"Glimco was well on his way to take over the teamsters unions\\" until the Daily Tribune series exposed him and put a halt to his plans. A grand jury investigation, prompted by the Daily Tribune series, opened two days later, and Glimco was indicted on charges of conspiracy and racketeering under the Hobbs Act. Glimco challenged the constitutionality of the Hobbs Act and claimed the statute of limitations had run out, assertions the government contested.; The bad press and indictment led the Teamsters international headquarters to conduct two probes into Glimco's union activities, both of which exonerated him of any wrongdoing.; ; ; ; ; A lengthy legal investigation followed the indictment, during which Glimco associates and other witnesses refused to testify, Glimco was alleged to have bribed police to avoid prosecution, and Glimco's legal team made repeated legal motions which delayed the trial for significant periods of time.; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; After a 12-day trial, Glimco was acquitted of all charges on March 26, 1957. Meanwhile, three more federal grand juries began investigating Glimco, looking into additional racketeering charges, his juke box leasing businesses, and the finances of the Fish Handlers & Filleters union.; ; Glimco was elected president of Local 777 on March 10, 1958. Just a month earlier, however, the United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management subpoenaed Glimco as part of its investigation into labor racketeering. The Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee had investigated Glimco's stewardship of the Local 777 pension and welfare fund in 1954 but never developed enough evidence to prove wrongdoing. But the Daily Tribune expos√© and additional Senate investigations in 1957 led to a new focus on him. The committee also subpoenaed Glimco's personal financial records, Local 777's financial and other records, and the Local 777 pension and welfare fund's financial and other records. Glimco initially refused to turn over the records but would let the Select Committee view them in his presence, and then claimed that he had no personal records. When the records were turned over, they were incomplete and Glimco did not stand guard over them day and night as he had pledged.; During his testimony before the Select Committee on April 24, Glimco asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination 80 times. Select Committee Chairman Senator John Little McClellan and Chief Counsel Robert F. Kennedy exchanged sharp words with Glimco: :Kennedy: And you defraud the union by charging the construction of your own home to the union, just like Mr. Dave Beck? :Glimco: I respectfully decline to answer because I honestly believe my answer might intend to incriminate me. :Kennedy: I would agree with you. :McClellan: I believe it would. :Kennedy: You haven't got the guts to answer, have you, Mr. Glimco? :Glimco: I respectfully decline to answer because I honestly believe my answer might intend to incriminate me. :McClellan: Morally, you are kind of yellow inside, are you not? :Glimco: I respectfully decline to answer because I honestly believe my answer might intend to incriminate me. The Select Committee also investigated the union contracts Glimco negotiated (which the committee felt were sweetheart deals) in June 1958, and Glimco's alleged domination of various Teamster unions in July 1958. But despite this extensive investigation and intense public questioning, however, Glimco was never prosecuted for these allegations. The Select Committee hearings lead to additional investigations into Glimco's activities, however. Committee investigators looked into Glimco's jukebox businesses, and eventually named him \\"boss of the jukebox rackets\\" in early 1959.; ; Despite a grand jury probe which identified Glimco as the owner of the biggest jukebox racket in the region, Glimco was never indicted. It was later alleged that he bribed witnesses to avoid indictment, but was never prosecuted on these charges. On March 11, 1959, the Select Committee held a week-long hearing into Glimco's union affairs, during which witnesses said they had been threatened, assaulted, and intimidated by him and his associates; that they had signed over portions of their wages to him in order to avoid assault; that he had extorted money from businesses and union members alike; that he had bribed witnesses to avoid prosecution and/or imprisonment; and that he had signed sweetheart deals with employers. Glimco testified before the Select Committee for the second time on March 12, 1959, but repeatedly invoked his Fifth Amendment rights again and again. During the hearings, investigators discovered that Glimco's police records had been destroyed by the Chicago police in 1949 at the request of State Representative Andrew A. Euzzino of Chicago, and that many of the records relating to earlier investigations into Glimco's alleged racketeering were missing.; The 1959 Select Committee hearings did reveal, however, that Glimco had used union monies to fund his legal defense efforts‚Äîmoney Senators and committee investigators said constituted income which Glimco did not report to the Internal Revenue Service. These few facts would later become important in convicting Glimco on tax evasion charges in 1968. NLRB challenge and legal battles Although Glimco's legal troubles appeared to be ending by mid-1959, his union troubles were just beginning. In 1947, Congress enacted the Taft‚ÄìHartley Act over President Harry S. Truman's veto.; The Taft-Hartley Act created legal standards which labor unions must meet regarding representation elections, coercing employees, strikes and picketing, and other actions; violation of these standards constitutes an unfair labor practice (ULP), and employees and workers can file ULPs against unions with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) for redress. In October 1958, a member of Local 777's taxicab drivers' union filed a ULP against Glimco for depriving him of the full amount due him by the union's pension and welfare fund and for inducing the man's employer to discharge him for requesting the full amount. Although the worker later received full reimbursement and reinstatement, the NLRB took the unheard-of step of refusing to drop the charges. The welfare fund ULP led to a widespread investigation into Glimco's stewardship of the union's pension, welfare, and insurance funds. In March 1959, two union trustees were accused of awarding union insurance business to a firm controlled by the mob and which charged excessive commissions. Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa was forced to publicly support Glimco even as state law enforcement officials began a formal criminal investigation. On March 20, 1959, the Occidental Life Insurance Company removed Glimco as disbursing and certifying official in charge of the Local 777 welfare fund. Glimco voided the insurance policy on April 17 after he failed to regain control of the fund from Occidental Life.; He was immediately sued by union members, who sought to restore the welfare fund. Glimco sued Occidental Life, and won a $54,000 judgment against the company in August 1960 for violating its contract with the union. The fight over the union funds led to a battle by union members to oust Glimco. Even though he had been under a 24-hour police guard since August 1958, Dominic Abata announced he was leading an effort to oust the Teamsters as the union representing Chicago's taxicab drivers.; Abata's supporters were assaulted even though they were ostensibly under police protection, which led to charges of police corruption, a civil lawsuit seeking a court injunction against further violence, and a number of ULP charges filed by members against Glimco.; ; ; On May 12, Abata's group, the Democratic Union Organizing Committee (DUOC), filed union representation petitions with the NLRB asking for elections to be held to determine which union (DUOC or the Teamsters) would continue to represent the drivers and mechanics at Yellow Cab Company and Checker Cab.; The subsequent representation election campaign was a violent one. Widespread assaults, bombings, shootings, arson, and threats were made against DUOC's leaders and supporters in what the press called a \\"wave of terror\\".; Glimco sued in mid-June to block the election, but both the NLRB and the federal courts refused to do so.; Abata won an NLRB hearing on whether to hold the election. But the first day of the hearings (on June 24, 1959) became \\"one of the wildest hearings in labor history\\": So many cab drivers attended the hearing that downtown traffic was snarled all day, so many people attended that the hearing had to be switch to a hotel ballroom and then a federal courthouse to maintain order, Glimco's supporters disrupted the proceedings by shouting through bullhorns, and Senate Select Committee investigators served subpoenas on Glimco staff members (who couldn't flee through the crowd to avoid the U.S. Marshals). A greater sense of decorum was observed over the next several weeks as DUOC witnesses testified about the alleged violence and intimidation aimed at them as they sought to oust the Glimco-led Teamsters union.; ; ; ; The hearings adjourned for several weeks in July while Abata and Glimco testified at the Senate Select Committee again. On August 13, as the NLRB hearings continued, court-appointed monitors for the Teamsters union ordered Jimmy Hoffa to fire Joey Glimco on grounds of corruption. The following day, a draft NLRB report (stemming from the original 1958 welfare fund ULP) requesting the issuance of numerous ULPs against Glimco and Local 777 was leaked to the press. Hoffa refused to fire Glimco, and the Board of Monitors went to U.S. federal court on August 25 to enforce their order.; On September 2, the monitors revised their order, reiterating their demand that Glimco be immediately fired and adding demands that Glimco lose his Teamster membership and forfeit funds, and that Hoffa conduct an immediate investigation into and an audit of Local 777's funds.; Glimco defiantly predicted he would never be fired. Hoffa defied the Board of Monitors, refusing to expel Glimco from the union.; In fact, even after a year had passed, Hoffa had yet to act on the order to expel Glimco. The battle at the NLRB dragged on through the fall of 1959. Glimco expelled a number of DUOC supporters from the union in late September despite the passage of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (the LMRDA, or Landrum-Griffin Act) on September 14, 1959, generally forbidding the denial of union members' rights on political grounds.; ; ; DUOC's attack on Glimco suffered another setback when the NLRB headquarters ruled on September 21 that testimony presented at the Senate Select Committee hearings could not be entered into evidence at the regional NRLB hearings in Chicago. Even as additional evidence of illegal actions by Glimco to stall an election and swing votes his way emerged, the NLRB's regional office blocked attempts to further stall the agency's hearings and said its final ruling would come in January 1960.; ; The agency also said it would hold hearings on the ULPs in the union funds cases in December and issue a ruling in three months. Even as the NRLB hearings on a potential election continued, Glimco called for union elections in which he ran for president unopposed and handily won on December 5, 1959.; ; Meanwhile, the Board of Monitors continued to press its case in court to force Hoffa to expel Glimco from the Teamsters. The monitors won favorable rulings from both the district court and the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.English v. Cunningham, 269 F.2d 517, 532-35 (D.C. Cir. 1959), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 905 (1959). On November 16, 1959, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear Hoffa's appeal, and the Board of Monitors pledged to move immediately to force Glimco out. As Glimco fought the NLRB and DUOC for control of the union, he also faced additional legal challenges. An Illinois grand jury began investigating him for perjury in September 1959, and two indictments were handed down on September 26.; Glimco pleaded not guilty, and attempted to quash the indictment but was unsuccessful.; ; ; Jury selection began in April, the jury was sequestered after being seated, and the trial began on June 27.; ; ; ; The jury found Glimco not guilty on June 30, 1960.; ; As the perjury trial wore on, Glimco was investigated yet again for racketerring in the jukebox distribution industry but no charges were filed against him.; ; The dispute over holding a union representation election continued at the NLRB throughout 1960. The NLRB subpoenaed Local 777 records as part of its investigation, and Glimco refused to turn them over even after a court ordered him to do so.; As the NLRB heard additional evidence about violence directed at DUOC supporters (including graphic photos of beatings) and the Chicago Police Department opened a new investigation into the sabotage of taxicabs driven by DUOC members,; the labor board halted further hearings pending receipt of records and gave Glimco a lengthy extension of time to submit these records (despite vigorous protests from U.S. Department of Labor and DUOC attorneys).; ; ; The hearings ended on March 11, 1960, when Glimco advised the NLRB that he would not turn over any records.; After a three-month lull in the NRLB's activities, NLRB attorneys filed a brief with the Board accusing Glimco of having coerced taxicab drivers into joining the union and paying dues. The NLRB's investigator said Glimco had colluded with Yellow Cab and Checker Cab to negotiate and enforce closed shop clauses in its collective bargaining agreements in violation of the Taft-Hartley Act. The investigator alleged that between $125,000 and $650,000 in dues were illegally collected, and demanded that Glimco refund these dues immediately. The 125-page brief led to a second investigation (this time into the making of loans out of union funds to local leaders in violation of the Landrum-Griffin Act) by Department of Labor attorneys. The new pressures on Glimco and Local 777 led to more death-threats against Abata and other DUOC leaders,; On July 21, 1960, an NLRB trial examiner found that Glimco and Local 777 had indeed coerced taxicab drivers into joining the union, and ordered the refund of $750,000 in illegally obtained dues. Glimco immediately appealed the NLRB's order. He was granted a delay on May 30, 1961, and refunded dues to just four cab drivers by June.; The NLRB had yet to rule on DUOC's petition for a union representational election by October 1960, which led DUOC members to strongly criticize the Board for the lengthy delays in issuing a ruling. Glimco attempted to organize taxicab drivers in suburban Chicago, which would demonstrate worker support for him and his administration of the union, but was unsuccessful. Nevertheless, he ran his own slate of candidates for delegate to the Teamsters national convention, and the slate easily won. An NLRB-supervised union representation election was finally held on July 19, 1961, and Local 777 was ousted as the taxicab drivers' representative. Both Glimco and DUOC promised a clean election, and the NLRB ordered that the election would be by secret ballot.; The NLRB also consolidated the ULP case with the election petition, held that Glimco and Local 777 had used coercion against DUOC in the election drive, and ordered Glimco again to refund dues to Yellow and Checker cab drivers. As the NLRB edged closer to setting an election date, Glimco asked a court on June 15 to halt the election, but the NLRB reiterated its intention to hold an election seven days later.; On June 26, the NLRB said the election would be held on July 19. On July 7, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals turned down Glimco's plea for a delay. As the election neared, Glimco spent more than $250,000 to sway members, and Abata and other DUOC leaders were put under a 24-hour police guard after \\"labor sluggers\\" began following them. DUOC had few funds to run a campaign, and Abata mortgaged his home and borrowed money to finance his campaign. Jimmy Hoffa declared his support for Glimco on July 13, and reiterated it the day before the election. He also sent numerous Teamsters staff into Chicago, ordering them to do everything possible to support Glimco and Local 777. To prevent even the appearance of intimidation during the voting, the NLRB election officer refused to allow Chicago police inside the buildings where the taxi drivers would be voting. On July 15, Glimco filed an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court to stop the election; it was the first time in American history the high court had been asked to block a union representation election. Glimco also filed an emergency petition with the NLRB seeking a halt to the election plans. Hoffa came to Chicago on July 16 to campaign on Glimco's behalf. On July 17, Illinois Democratic Senator Paul Douglas endorsed Abata. The same day, U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Tom C. Clark and the NLRB denied Glimco's petitions. On election day, the Chicago police ordered extra patrols in areas where balloting was occurring, and the NLRB banned electioneering near polling places. On July 19, more than 5,000 cab drivers and cab company mechanics in four bargaining units voted 3,122 to 1,760 to oust Local 777 and seek representation by DUOC. Second NLRB election fight Glimco blamed the election loss on Senator Douglas' July 17 comments. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, the Illinois Federation of Labor, and the Chicago Crime Commission hailed the election as a blow to mob dominance of Chicago unions. The loss also weakened Glimco's position in the mob. In part, this was also due to external events beyond his control. Glimco's chief patron in the Chicago Outfit, Louis Campagna, had retired around 1950. Murray \\"The Camel\\" Humphreys tried to oversee Glimco's activities after Campagna's departure but had been forced out of the labor rackets by his fellow mobsters in 1953. Over the next few years, Humphreys continued to accuse Glimco of picking fights with other gangsters. Campagna died of a heart attack in Florida in 1955. That left Glimco with no patron in the mob. With the election loss, Humphreys and other top Chicago Outfit leaders now began considering ousting Glimco in favor of mobsters like Gus Zapas (a Hoffa aide), Rudy Fratto (another Hoffa associate), and Carl Hildebrand (a Humphreys prot√©g√©). Glimco immediately began to fight to regain control of the rebel cab drivers and mechanics. A legal strategy was planned which would overturn the election on the grounds that the NLRB election agents were biased. This strategy failed when the NLRB's regional office denied his appeal in August 1961. A further appeal to the national NLRB also failed. Local 777 also tried to continue to deduct dues from the breakaway workers even though it no longer represented them. Organizing new workers into the union was another aspect of the strategy to improve Glimco's standing in the union and the Chicago Outfit. Under his direction, Local 777 launched an organizing drive among suburban Chicago cab drivers in August 1961.; The success of the Checker and Yellow cab drivers had ramifications beyond Local 777. Truck drivers dissatisfied with the Teamsters union considered forming an independent union under DUOC's leadership. In mid-August, cab drivers in St. Louis, Missouri, disaffiliated from the Teamsters, and disaffiliation efforts began in several truck drivers' locals throughout the Midwest. Glimco needed to strengthen his control in Chicago in order to discourage the rebellions, or else the Chicago Outfit would remove him from power. Glimco's only remaining tactic was to regain control over the breakaway cab drivers and mechanics via a second union representational organizing election, and that is the strategy he subsequently pursued. The NLRB certified the election results on September 12, 1961; Abata was elected president of the new union 10 days later; and contract talks opened with the employers.; DUOC secured a three-year contract in March 1962. Glimco declared the DUOC contract to be a sweetheart deal, and sued to prevent it from coming into force. Despite earlier reluctance to support Abata, the AFL-CIO now embraced his union and granted DUOC charters which helped protect the newly established union from being raided for members by other AFL-CIO unions. Seafarers International Union President Paul Hall agreed (with the backing of the AFL-CIO Executive Council) to let DUOC affiliate with his union on January 18, 1962. At the ceremony presenting the charter to DUOC, Local 777 threw up a picket line, taunted Abata and Hall, and then assaulted a police officer. The police hustled the Teamsters members out of the meeting room and advised Abata and Hall to leave. When they did, the picketers assaulted them in the street. Abata and Hall held their own for several minutes until additional police arrived to break up the melee.; ; ; The charter presentation incident was only the first of many acts of violence, vandalism, intimidation, coercion, burglary, and bombings that followed over the next three years. DUOC's offices were broken into five days after the charter ceremony. Taxicabs driven by DUOC members were stolen, vandalized, set ablaze, and thrown into the Chicago River. Someone attempted to burn down Local 777's offices, and Jimmy Hoffa announced he would have Teamsters organizers ride in DUOC cabs in order to convince them to rejoin the Teamsters. But the Chicago Police Department accused Glimco's supporters of setting the fire and exonerated DUOC supporters of any crimes. Chicago police cars began tailing taxis throughout the city in order to stop the violence, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began a probe into the violence.; ; As Glimco's suit against the enforcement of the DUOC contract continued, federal District court judge Julius Howard Miner used the lawsuit as a means of bringing Glimco under the jurisdiction of the court in an attempt to stop the violence.; DUOC alleged that Local 777 attorneys were corrupt and Glimco tried to have the court void the union shop provisions of the contract as a violation of the Taft-Hartley Act, but in November 1962 Judge Miner ruled that the contract was valid and could be enforced.; ; ; ; ; ; ; High levels of violence continued throughout the latter half of 1962 and into the summer of 1963.; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; The violence did not win DUOC members to the Teamsters side, but did lead DUOC members to question Abata's leadership. The violence wound down throughout the latter half of 1963. In November 1963, the NLRB filed ULPs against Local 777, accusing it of intimidation and coercion in the ongoing labor fight‚Äîcharges Glimco strenuously denied.; On April 17, 1964, despite three months of negotiations between the union and the NLRB, Glimco and Local 777 were found guilty of contempt of court by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and ordered to cease and desist all violence, coercion, and intimidation against DUOC. On August 30, 1964, DUOC vice president Everett L. \\"Red\\" Clark announced he was running against Dominic Abata for the presidency of DUOC. Clark won the election held on September 3, 1964, by a vote of 777 to 767.; ; ; Even as Glimco was yet again held in contempt by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals (and even arrested), he filed for a union representation election in the four DUOC-represented bargaining units in November 1964.; ; . The indictment on which he was arrested was dismissed in 1965. See: Stung by criticism over its years-long delay in the previous election filing, the NLRB moved with dispatch and ordered a second representation election in April 1965.; ; ; But as the May 5 election approached, there were signs that Glimco was losing his hold over Local 777. On April 22, Teamsters Joint Council 25 took control of the Teamsters election campaign and moved the election headquarters out of Local 777's offices.; The AFL-CIO and Chicago Federation of Labor campaigned heavily for DUOC.; ; But more than 80 individual CFL unions supported Local 777, as did William McFetridge, the former president of the Service Employees International Union.; Both the Seafarers and Teamsters sent large numbers of staff into Chicago to sway votes, and an estimated $250,000 was spent by both sides. But the 6,000 cab drivers and mechanics voted 3,081 to 1,612 to continue their representation with DUOC. Later life and death Glimco's 1959 appearance before the Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management resulted in his indictment in 1964. The investigation began in the fall of 1961, when federal investigators concluded that Glimco owed $144,000 in back taxes. A federal grand jury indicted him on 17 counts of income tax evasion on December 17, 1964, to which Glimco pleaded not guilty.; ; After a two-year delay, Glimco went on trial, and on June 19, 1968, a federal district court found him liable for $94,465 in back taxes, fines, and penalties.; ; Glimco appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the Court rejected his appeal on December 9, 1968.; Glimco delayed paying the taxes and fines for another year, and in February 1970 the federal government filed suit to seize his home and automobile in order to obtain payment. Glimco agreed to pay the taxes, but did not do so until May 1973 (when the amount, plus interest, equalled more than $200,000). Concurrently with his tax troubles, Glimco was indicted for violations of the Taft-Hartley Act again. On June 1, 1966, a federal grand jury accused him of accepting a sports car, home sprinkler system, frozen turkeys, and other gifts from employers so that he might use his influence in another union's collective bargaining negotiations and secure a better deal for the employers.; Glimco pleaded not guilty. Initially, Glimco also claimed that since the prior indictments on the charges had been dismissed in 1957 because they had been improperly drawn, he should not stand trial on the redrawn indictment either. But a federal court disagreed in April 1967. More than 22 delays were permitted by the court during Glimco's subsequent trial, but on February 4, 1969, he changed his plea to guilty and agreed to a $40,000 fine‚Äîthe most severe penalty permitted by the Taft-Hartley Act.; ; ; Glimco's authority within the Teamsters suffered a significant blow after the second election loss. Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa considered removing him as Local 777 president. But although Glimco remained president of Local 777, his power within the Teamsters and the Chicago Outfit was broken and he largely dropped from public sight after 1965. Nevertheless, he still remained involved with the Chicago Outfit. In 1970, Senator John McClellan sponsored and the Congress passed the Organized Crime Control Act, a law crafted partly in response to the difficulty law enforcement officials had in breaking Glimco's hold on the Chicago taxi drivers' union.; ; Glimco made a rare public appearance in 1972 when he attended the funeral of Paul Ricca. Glimco's legal troubles dogged him until his death. The lawsuits over the misuse of Local 777's pension and welfare fund did not end until June 1977, making it one of the longest-running lawsuits in Chicago court history. The final charges against him came in 1989. In March 1989, the Teamsters settled a long-running labor racketeering lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice and agreed to be supervised by an Independent Review Board (IRB) and staff of monitors in order to avoid being taken over by the federal government. In December 1989, one of the federal monitors sought to remove Glimco from the union due to his lengthy and ongoing involvement with organized crime. These charges against Glimco were still pending when he died at MacNeal Hospital in Berwyn, Illinois on April 28, 1991. Glimco is buried in Queen of Heaven Cemetery, Hillside, Illinois.

It is a popular garden plant with showy yellow blooms. Taxonomy The golden penda was first described in 1864 by Victorian Government Botanist Ferdinand von Mueller as Metrosideros chrysantha, after being collected by John Dallachy on 12 April 1864 from Rockingham Bay in northern Queensland. It was reclassified in the genus Xanthostemon by George Bentham in the third volume of his Flora Australiensis in 1867. The species name is derived from the Ancient Greek words chrysos \\"golden\\", and \\"anthos\\" \\"flower\\". Description Xanthostemon chrysanthus grows as a tree to high and wide in the wild. It is generally much more compact in gardens. The bark is rough and the habit bushy. The shiny green elliptic leaves measuring 7‚Äì22 cm long by 2‚Äì9.5 cm wide. They are arranged in whorls along the stems. The flowerheads, or racemes, are terminal or axillary and measure up to in diameter. They are made up of numerous small (1‚Äì2 cm diameter) individual golden flowers. Flowering is followed by small (1-1,5 cm) green or brown woody capsules which are ripe between August and February. Flowers can appear at any time of year. Flowers detail, Qld Distribution and habitat The range is from Cardwell northwards into Cape York Peninsula in Far North Queensland. It grows in open forest or rainforest, often along the banks of creeks and rivers. Cultivation Xanthostemon chrysanthus is cultivated as an ornamental plant by plant nurseries, for use in gardens and park landscaping. Its horticultural appeal stems from its profuse and attractive flowering. Golden penda can be propagated by seed or cuttings. It grows well in subtropical gardens with fair drainage and sunny aspect. The species is less reliable in flowering in climates such as Sydney and cooler.  Expo Gold  The golden penda tree was selected as the theme plant for Expo 88. Cuttings of the tree, which is native to north Queensland, were taken from a superior form from a garden in Brisbane and planted in flower in Brisbane to create a 'Sea of Gold'. In late autumn, the tree can still be seen in flower in gardens and lining streets across Brisbane. The tree is also the native floral emblem of Cairns.

He was awarded the Bancroft Prize for his 2006 book Mockingbird Song: Ecological Landscapes of the South. Early life and education Kirby was born on August 22, 1938, in Portsmouth, Virginia, his ancestors having immigrated to the South in the 17th century, by family tradition. Throughout his college education he majored in history, earning his bachelor's degree at Old Dominion University and then attending the University of Virginia, where he was awarded a master's degree and a doctorate.Hevesi, Dennis. \\"Jack T.

He also served as president of the Southern Historical Association. In his published works ‚Äî he authored or edited seven books ‚Äî Kirby tried to dispel the sweeping generalizations of Southerners from books that he felt were aimed at \\"making Northern white folks feel good about themselves by telling the same story over and over again about the South\\". His 1978 book Media-Made Dixie took issue with the portrayal of Southerners using \\"clich√©s of racists, graceful landed gentry, poverty, homespun rural values, stock-car racers and moonshiners\\". Rather than focusing on the South as it really exists, the books shows depictions from the dawn of the cinema and the creation of best seller lists, starting at D. W.

A lawyer by training, Willis was a graduate of McMaster University and Osgoode Hall Law School. He was appointed to his party position by then federal leader John Bracken. Under John George Diefenbaker, Willis was one of the \\"three musketeers\\" who ran the Ontario wing along with Edwin A. Goodman and Senator William Brunt. Diefenbaker appointed Willis to the Senate in June 1962. He stepped down as Ontario chairman following the 1963 federal election in which the Tories were defeated by Lester Pearson's Liberals with only 26 Progressive Conservative MPs being elected in Ontario. In the business world, Willis sat on several boards of directors, including those of Denison Mines and Standard Trust. He was president of Caledon Holdings Limited, which developed residential subdivisions. The company owned near which Wilson wished to develop despite the province's plans to create park Forks of the Credit Provincial Park. Wilson continued buying property in the area despite the province's plans. The provincial Progressive Conservative government purchased the land from Wilson in 1971, giving him an 81% profit, which resulted in complaints by the parliamentary opposition and a formal inquiry which found no wrongdoing on the part of Willis but which criticized the government for not bargaining for a lower price.\\"Senator was chairman of Tories in Ontario\\", Globe and Mail, March 25, 1972 Willis died in flight from Ottawa to Toronto.\\"Senator dies on flight to Toronto\\", Toronto Star, March 24, 1972 References External links * Category:1904 births Category:1972 deaths Category:Canadian political consultants Category:Lawyers in Ontario Category:Canadian senators from Ontario Category:Progressive Conservative Party of Canada senators Category:20th-century Canadian lawyers ","title":"Harry Albert Willis"},{"id":"23998969","text":"Faiano is an Italian town and hamlet (frazione) of the municipality of Pontecagnano Faiano in the province of Salerno, Campania region.

Starting as an avid republican opposed to Emperor Napoleon III, he pushed the Emperor toward liberal reforms and in turn came increasingly into Napoleon's grip. He entered the cabinet and was the prime minister when Napoleon fell. Biography √âmile Ollivier was born in Marseille. His father, D√©mosth√®ne Ollivier (1799‚Äì1884), was a vehement opponent of the July Monarchy, and was returned by Marseille to the Constituent Assembly in 1848 which established a republic. The father's opposition to Louis Napoleon led to his banishment after the coup d'√©tat of December 1851, and he returned to France only in 1860. With the establishment of the Second Republic, his father's influence with Ledru-Rollin secured for √âmile Ollivier the position of commissary- general of the d√©partement of Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne. Ollivier, then twenty-three, had just been called to the Parisian bar. Less radical in his political opinions than his father, he suppressed a socialist uprising at Marseille, commending himself to General Cavaignac, who made him prefect of the department. He was shortly afterwards removed to the comparatively unimportant prefecture of Chaumont-la-Ville (Haute-Marne), a demotion perhaps brought about by his father's enemies. He resigned from the civil service to take up a practice at the bar, where his abilities assured his success. Calls for a Liberal Empire He re-entered political life in 1857 as deputy for the 3rd circumscription of the Seine d√©partement. His candidacy had been supported by the Si√®cle, and he joined the constitutional opposition. With Alfred Darimon, Jules Favre, JL H√©non and Ernest Picard he formed a group known as Les Cinq (the Five), which wrung from Napoleon III some concessions in the direction of constitutional government. Although still a republican, Ollivier was a moderate who was prepared to accept the Empire in return for civil liberties even if it was a step-by-step process. The imperial decree of 24 November, permitting the insertion of parliamentary reports in the Moniteur, and an address from the Corps L√©gislatif in reply to the speech from the throne, were welcomed by him as an initial piece of reform. This marked a considerable change of attitude, for only a year previously he attacked the imperial government, in the course of a defence of √âtienne Vacherot, brought to trial for the publication of La D√©mocratie. This resulted in his suspension from the bar for three months. He gradually separated from his old associates, who grouped themselves around Jules Favre, and during the session of 1866‚Äì1867, Ollivier formed a third party, which supported the principle of a Liberal Empire. On the last day of December 1866, Count AFJ Walewski, continuing negotiations begun by the duc de Morny, offered to make Ollivier the Minister of Education, representing the general policy of the government in the Chamber. The imperial decree of 19 January 1867, together with the promise inserted in the Moniteur of a relaxation of the stringency of the press laws and of concessions in respect of the right of public meeting, failed to satisfy Ollivier's demands, and he refused the office. Politics Co√Ød√© published in Vanity Fair in 1870. On the eve of the general election of 1869, he published a manifesto, Le 19 janvier, on his policy. The s√©natus- consulte of 8 September 1869 gave the two chambers ordinary parliamentary rights, and was followed by the dismissal of Eug√®ne Rouher and the formation in the last week of that year of a ministry of which Ollivier was really premier, although that office was not nominally recognized by the constitution. The new cabinet, known as the ministry of 2 January, had a hard task before it, complicated a week after its formation by the shooting of Victor Noir, a Republican journalist, by Pierre Napoleon Bonaparte, the Emperor's cousin. Ollivier immediately summoned the high court of justice for the judgment of Prince Bonaparte and Joachim Murat. The riots following the murder were suppressed without bloodshed; circulars were sent round to the prefects forbidding them to put pressure on the electors in favour of official candidates; Baron Haussmann was dismissed from the prefecture of the Seine d√©partement. The violent press campaign against the emperor, to whom he had promised a happy old age, was broken by the prosecution of Henri Rochefort; and on 20 April a s√©natus-consulte was issued which accomplished the transformation of the Empire into a constitutional monarchy. Neither concessions nor firmness sufficed to appease the \\"Irreconcilables\\" of the opposition, who since the relaxation of the press laws were able to influence the electorate. On 8 May, however, the amended constitution was submitted, on Rouher's advice, to a plebiscite, which resulted in a vote of nearly seven to one in favour of the government. This appeared to confirm that Napoleon III' son would succeed him and was a bitter blow to the Republicans. The most distinguished members of the Left in the cabinet ‚Äì LJ Buffet, Napoleon Daru and Auguste de Talhou√´t-Roy ‚Äì resigned in April over the plebiscite. Ollivier himself held the ministry of foreign affairs for a month, until Daru was replaced by the duc de Gramont, Ollivier's evil genius. The other vacancies were filled by J.P. M√®ge and Charles Ignace Plichon, both of them of Conservative tendencies.  Franco-Prussian War 1870/71  The revival of the candidature of Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen for the Spanish throne early in 1870 disconcerted Ollivier's plans. The French government, following Gramont's advice, instructed their ambassador to Prussia, Benedetti, to demand from the Prussian king a formal disavowal of the Hohenzollern candidature. Ollivier allowed himself to be won over by the war party. It is unlikely that he could have prevented the eventual outbreak of war, maybe he might have postponed it if he had heard Benedetti's account of the incident. He was outmanoeuvered by Otto von Bismarck, and on 15 July he made a hasty declaration in the Chamber that the Prussian government had issued to the powers a note announcing the rebuff received by Benedetti, the Ems Dispatch. He obtained a war vote of 500,000,000 francs, and said that he accepted the responsibility of the war \\"with a light heart,\\" saying that the war had been forced on France. On 9 August, the French Army had lost three battles in three days (Battle of Wissembourg, of Spicheren and of W√∂rth), the Ollivier cabinet was driven from office, and Ollivier sought refuge from the general rage in Italy. He returned to France in 1873, but although he carried on an active campaign in the Bonapartist Estafette his political power was gone, and even in his own party he came into collision in 1880 with Paul de Cassagnac.  Private life  He had many connections with the literary and artistic world, being one of the early Parisian champions of Richard Wagner. Elected to the Academy in 1870, he did not take his seat. His first wife, Blandine Liszt, was the daughter of Franz Liszt and Marie d'Agoult. She died in 1862, and in September 1869 Ollivier married Marie-Th√©r√®se Gravier, then 19 years old. They had three children. Literary works During his retirement he employed himself in writing a history of L'Empire lib√©ral, the first volume of which appeared in 1895. The work really dealt with the remote and immediate causes of the war, and was the author's apology for his blunder. The 13th volume showed that the immediate blame could not justly be placed entirely on his shoulders. L'Empire lib√©ral can be considered as an important document for the history of his time. ** Vol. 1 (1895): le principe des Nationalit√©s (online) ** Vol. 2 (1897): Louis-Napol√©on et le coup d' √©tat (online) ** Vol. 3 (1898): Napol√©on III (online) ** Vol. 4 (1899): Napol√©on III et Cavour (online) ** Vol. 5 (1900): L'Inauguration de l'Empire lib√©rale roi Guillaume (online) ** Vol. 6: La Pologne; les √©lections de 1863, la loi des coalitions (online) ** Vol. 7 (1903): Le d√©membrement du Danemark; Le syllabus; La mort de Morny; L'entrevue de Biarritz (online) ** Vol. 8 (1903): L' Ann√©e fatale - Sadowa (1866) (online) ** Vol. 9 (1904): Le D√©sarroi (online) ** Vol. 10 (1905): l' Agonie de l' Empire autoritaire (online) ** Vol. 11 (1907): La veill√©e des armes.

The battle was fought between Australian forces from 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR) and elements of the 17th Tank Brigade of the Korean People's Army (KPA) over a key bridge across the Taeryong River near Kujin, North Korea. On 25 October the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade had resumed their advance towards Pakchon after crossing the Chongchon River, with 3 RAR as the lead battalion. Arriving at Kujin, the Australians discovered that the centre span of the concrete bridge had been demolished by KPA engineers, blocking their passage across the river. A platoon-sized reconnaissance patrol crossed the river using debris from the destroyed span; however, it was soon forced to withdraw by KPA holding the high ground. Airstrikes and artillery fire were subsequently called-in at 17:15 by the Australians as they prepared to conduct an assault. At 19:00 that evening, following the clearance of nearby Pakchon by D Company 3 RAR, the Australians sent two companies across the river to establish a bridgehead and prevent the KPA from consolidating their position on the western bank. A and B Companies subsequently established defensive positions on either side of the road. Shortly afterwards KPA forces were detected forming up for an assault on the right flank against B Company, and these preparations were broken up with mortars. The KPA then engaged the forward Australian companies with mortar fire which was largely ineffective. However, by 22:30 KPA activity increased significantly, with heavy small arms fire causing a number of casualties among the Australians which perilously had to be evacuated under fire by boat across the fast flowing tidal river. Further artillery support was called-in by the Australians at 23:00 in response to renewed concentrations by the KPA in preparation for an assault. Meanwhile, the Australians sent another platoon across the river to reinforce the companies on the western bank. At 04:00 on 26 October the KPA counterattacked A and B Companies, supported by a two T-34 tanks. In the ensuing fighting a convoy of KPA vehicles, including a tank, two jeeps, a motorcycle and about 60 infantry moved down the road towards A Company with the intention of re-occupying the ridges overlooking the river crossing. The Australians ambushed the convoy at close range with small arms fire and mortars, forcing the KPA to flee after abandoning their vehicles with only the tank successfully shooting its way out. Later another T-34 tank and supporting infantry pressed to within of the B Company headquarters, before stopping and taking up a position between the ridges unaware of the location of the Australians. By dawn the Australians were still in possession of the bridgehead. At 07:00, a further airstrike was called-in on the KPA holding the ridges to the west of the 3 RAR positions. With the way reported clear, C and D Companies crossed the river from the eastern bank later that morning. The battle continued during the morning; however, by 12:00 the KPA finally withdrew, abandoning the bridge to the Australians. Background Military situation The Korean War began early in the morning of 25 June 1950, following the surprise invasion of the Republic of Korea by its northern neighbour, the communist Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). Numerically superior and better-equipped, the KPA crossed the 38th Parallel and rapidly advanced south, easily overcoming the inferior Republic of Korea Army (ROK). In response, the United Nations decided to intervene on behalf of South Korea, inviting member states to send forces to restore the situation. As a consequence, American ground forces were hastily deployed in an attempt to prevent the South Koreans from collapsing; however, they too were understrength and poorly equipped, and by early August had been forced back by the KPA to an enclave around Pusan, known as the Pusan Perimeter. Key US allies‚ÄîBritain, Canada and Australia‚Äîalso committed forces, although these were initially limited to naval contingents and were largely viewed as token efforts in the US. Under diplomatic pressure the British agreed to deploy an infantry brigade in July, and would later dispatch a second brigade as the crisis worsened. The Canadians also agreed to provide an infantry brigade, although the first battalion would not arrive until December 1950. A total of 21 UN member states eventually contributed forces. P-51 Mustang fighters from No. 77 Squadron RAAF at Iwakuni, 1950. Australia was one of the first nations to commit units to the fighting, playing a small but sometimes significant part in the UN forces, which was initially led by General Douglas MacArthur. Forces deployed in Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force formed the basis of the Australian response, with P-51 Mustang fighter-bombers from No. 77 Squadron RAAF flying their first missions on 2 July, while the frigate and the destroyer were also committed to naval operations. During this time the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR), which had been preparing to return to Australia prior to the outbreak of the war, remained in Japan; however, on 26 July the Australian government announced that it would also commit the understrength and poorly equipped infantry battalion to the fighting, following a period of preparation. Training and re-equipment began immediately, while hundreds of reinforcements were hastily recruited in Australia as part of K Force; they soon began arriving to fill out the battalion. The battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Floyd Walsh, was subsequently replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Charles Green. An officer with extensive operational experience fighting the Japanese in New Guinea during the Second World War, Green took over from Walsh due to the latter's perceived inexperience. On 23 September 1950, 3 RAR embarked for Korea, concentrating at Pusan on 28 September. There it joined the British 27th Infantry Brigade, a garrison formation hurriedly committed from Hong Kong by the British as the situation deteriorated around the Pusan Perimeter in late August to bolster the US Eighth Army under Lieutenant General Walton Walker. Commanded by Brigadier Basil Coad, the brigade was renamed the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade and consisted of the 1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highland Regiment (1 ASHR), the 1st Battalion, Middlesex Regiment (1 MR) and 3 RAR. Understrength, the two British battalions had each mustered just 600 men of all ranks, while the brigade was also short on transport and heavy equipment, and had no integral artillery support, for which it would rely entirely on the Americans until the 16th Field Regiment, Royal New Zealand Artillery arrived in January 1951. As such, with a strength of nearly 1,000 men, the addition of 3 RAR gave the brigade increased tactical weight as well as expediently allowing the Australians to work within a familiar organisational environment, rather than being attached to a US formation. Also under the command of the brigade were a number of US Army units, including 155 mm howitzers from the 90th Field Artillery Battalion, M4 Sherman tanks from 89th Tank Battalion and a company from the US 72nd Combat Engineer Battalion. Prelude Opposing forces Map of the UN advance toward the Yalu River, 1950. By the time 3 RAR arrived in the theatre, the KPA had been broken and were in rapid retreat, with MacArthur's forces conducting a successful amphibious assault at Inchon and breakout from the Pusan Perimeter on the southern tip of the Korean peninsula. A steady advance began, driving the North Koreans northwards towards the 38th Parallel. The 27th British Commonwealth Brigade was airlifted from Taegu to Kimpo Airfield north of Seoul on 5 October; however, its vehicles had to move by road, driving , and did not arrive until 9 October. It was subsequently attached to the US 1st Cavalry Division, under the command of Major General Hobart R. Gay. On 16 October the brigade took over from the US 7th Cavalry Regiment as the vanguard of the UN advance into North Korea, its axis intended to take it through Kaesong, Kumchon and Hungsu-ri to Sariwon, then through Hwangju to the North Korean capital of Pyongyang. Although the KPA had suffered heavily in the preceding weeks, they continued to resist strongly, while a lack of accurate maps and the narrowness of the roads made rapid movement difficult for the advancing UN forces. During this time 3 RAR had a platoon of American M4 Sherman tanks attached and a battery of field guns in direct support. The 27th British Commonwealth Brigade subsequently moved from Kumchon, with the Argylls capturing Sariwon on 17 October, killing 215 KPA and taking many prisoners for the loss of one man killed and three wounded. The brigade then passed to the command of the US 24th Infantry Division on 21 October, under the overall command of Major General John H. Church, while the US 1st Cavalry Division remained in Pyongyang to complete its capture. The 27th British Commonwealth Brigade was subsequently ordered to seize Chongju. Consequently, the brigade continued to advance north with little respite, and on 22 October the Australians fought their first major action at Yongju, killing 150 KPA and capturing 239 of the brigade's 800 prisoners, for the loss of seven men wounded. Intending to defeat the KPA and bring the war to a close, the UN forces pushed towards the Yalu River, on the Chinese border. Resistance continued to be met as the brigade crossed the Chongchon River however, and they now moved towards Pakchon. On 24 October, MacArthur had removed all restrictions on the movement of his forces south of the Yalu River and prepared for the final phase of the UN advance, defying a directive of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff and risking Chinese intervention in support of North Korea. With the Middlesex in the vanguard, the lead elements of the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade successfully crossed the Chongchon unopposed at Sinanju on 24 October using assault boats. The British battalion then established a defensive position over-looking the main bridge in preparation for the remainder of the brigade to continue the advance the following day. However, both the road and rail bridges at Sinanju had previously been damaged and they were subsequently found to be unsuitable for use by vehicles and armour, while the tidal current also prevented the rafting of even light vehicles by the American engineers attached to the brigade. Meanwhile, the road bridge at Anju, east, was also found to be damaged by ROK 1st Infantry Division when it entered the town. Following repairs the bridge was made available to the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade's light wheeled vehicles on 25 October, while the accompanying Sherman tanks located a ford upstream, and were able to cross the Chongchon at that point. With winter approaching, the British and Australians encountered the first of the cold weather as the temperature began to drop well below freezing at night. Consequently, prior to leaving Sinanju purpose-designed American cold-weather clothing was issued; however, with stocks in short supply only a few of the men received the equipment, even after a second issue was arranged several days later. Battle Fighting on the Taeryong River, 25 October 1950 That afternoon Coad ordered 3 RAR to resume the lead and continue the advance towards Pakchon, the next major town north on the Taeryong River. The Australians subsequently moved through the Middlesex, supported by tanks from D Company, 89th Tank Battalion. By 16:00 B Company 3 RAR had reached the village of Kujin, south of Pakchon, where the main west coast road diverged from the road to Pakchon, turning west across the Taeryong River to continue towards Chongju and the Manchurian border. There the Australians discovered that the centre span of the concrete bridge had been demolished by KPA engineers, blocking their passage across the river. Forced to halt, the 3-inch mortars from Support Company 3 RAR were brought into a position to provide indirect fire support to the battalion. Meanwhile, using roughly made timber ladders from the debris of the bridge, two sections of 4 Platoon under the command of Lieutenant Alan Morrison crossed the bridge covered by the remainder of B Company and the tanks in order to reconnoitre the far bank. On the other side of the river the road ran through a ridge which rose steeply above the water. After advancing to the foot of the ridge, 50 KPA came forward from the hills to surrender to the Australians, and almost immediately they came under heavy but inaccurate fire from other KPA concealed in the hills. The surrendering KPA then scattered into the scrub, while the Australians returned fire. A United States Air Force (USAF) LT-6G Mosquito light spotter aircraft scouting beyond the western bank subsequently reported the presence of two KPA companies to the north, overlooking the bridgehead. alt=Four caucasian soldiers in uniform sitting on the ground talking. Three of the men are wearing slouch hats, while the fourth is wearing a cap. Having established that the KPA held the high ground, Green ordered Morrison to withdraw across the bridge in order to allow an airstrike to take place from 17:15, with the platoon bringing 10 KPA prisoners with them as they did so. Two USAF F-80 Shooting Stars subsequently strafed the KPA positions across the river until 17:30. A and B Companies were then instructed to prepare to assault the KPA positions on the western bank; however, the approach of dusk prevented a second airstrike and a fire plan was subsequently arranged by the American artillery and the battalion mortars before a more substantial thrust across the river was launched by the Australians. In the meantime Green had also sent D Company into Pakchon to clear the town in order to protect the Australian right flank, and under the command of Major Walter Brown they reported entering the town at 17:00. D Company subsequently returned at 18:30, bringing 225 prisoners with them after leaving a platoon to guard the American engineers which had begun constructing a ford from a damaged underwater bridge for use the following day. Meanwhile, a KPA machine-gun sporadically engaged the Australians on their left, while strong concentrations of KPA troops were detected on the west bank. 3 RAR establishes a bridgehead, 25/26 October 1950 With the bridge considered important by the advancing Eighth Army, the Australians were determined to a force a passage across the river. However, with only a platoon from D Company holding a tenuous bridgehead at the Pakchon ford as dusk fell, Green could either cross the river the following morning via the ford, or he could attempt a lodgement across the bridge that night. He resolved to strengthen his position and at 19:00 A and B Companies were sent across the river to secure the bridgehead and prevent the KPA from being reinforced and consolidating their position on the western bank. Again using the broken span, the Australians crossed the river and scaled the bank in the moonlight, before establishing defensive positions on both sides of the road on the crest from the Taeryong. Achieving their objectives the Australians then spread out along the ridgeline, with A Company under Captain William Chitts on the left and B Company on the right commanded by Major George Thirlwell. Unchallenged, the Australians suspected that the KPA had withdrawn and, still largely without winter clothing, they then began to dig-in amid a sub-zero wind which blew in from Manchuria, away. Green deployed the remainder of the battalion on the eastern bank, with D Company to the north near Kujin, C Company to the east flanking the road to Sinanju and battalion headquarters located to the south in a paddy field. The American tanks were subsequently allocated to both C and D Companies and they provided rear security to the battalion during the night. Shortly afterwards, at 19:30, B Company detected a KPA force of around company-size preparing for a frontal assault, and called- in mortar fire to break up their formations, while a number of forward patrols had to be withdrawn by the Australians in order to prevent their encirclement. In response the KPA fired mortars at the Australian positions with limited effect. Half an hour later KPA shells hit the 3 RAR battalion headquarters and C Company positions on the other side of the river, however the rounds landed in the damp soil of the paddy field and failed to explode. Periodically they were also targeted by machine-gun fire, but it was mostly high and posed little threat. Perhaps also under the impression that the Australians had withdrawn, the KPA failed to press their attack. Yet they soon realised their mistake and heavy small arms fire began again at 22:30 with KPA activity against A and B Companies increasing significantly, which resulted in B Company suffering two killed and three wounded. The Australian right flank was now exposed and following a request from Thirlwell, Chitts detached 1 Platoon under Lieutenant John Wathen to bolster B Company. At 23:00 further artillery and mortar fire missions were ordered by the Australians against the KPA in response to renewed concentrations in preparation for an assault. Around the same time 8 Platoon C Company under Lieutenant Colin Townsend was sent across the bridge in the darkness to further reinforce B Company, and they dug-in on each side of the road leading to the bridge. Telephone lines had been laid by the Australians to their forward companies, and despite the fighting they remained intact throughout the battle. KPA activity continued throughout the night, and although this resulted in further casualties in A and B Companies, they were unable to penetrate the forward Australian positions. Among the dead was Wathen, whose platoon was attacked by the KPA after moving to cover the exposed B Company position, resulting in several other Australians also being wounded. Meanwhile, during the evening the 3 RAR Assault Pioneer Platoon had also discovered and destroyed a small KPA arms dump on the eastern bank of the river. The Australians subsequently attempted to evacuate their casualties from the forward companies, and although these had been relatively light the task proved perilous. With the bridge still down, the wounded had to be carried by hand on stretchers to the broken span and then lowered to a boat borrowed from the American engineers. The boat was then hauled by ropes back across to the eastern bank of the river where the casualties were load into jeep ambulances. Despite a number of difficulties the majority of the casualties were successfully evacuated by these means, even as the bridge occasionally came under small arms fire. However, at around 01:00, while evacuating the final casualty, the boat came under fire again from KPA snipers and sank after being swept against a concrete piling. The wounded soldier fell into the fast flowing Taeryong River and the 3 RAR battalion drum-major, Sergeant Thomas Murray, subsequently dived into the freezing waters and rescued him. Murray was later awarded the George Medal for his actions. Although a KPA SU-76 self-propelled gun had occasionally shelled Kujin with armour piercing rounds, there had been no reports of tanks being detected during the evening. However, at 04:00 on 26 October the KPA counterattacked the Australian companies with the support of T-34 tanks. In the ensuing fighting a convoy of KPA vehicles, including a T-34 tank, two jeeps, a motorcycle and about 60 infantry moved down the road towards A Company with the intention of re-occupying the ridges overlooking the river crossing, likely unaware of the Australian dispositions. The Australians held their fire until the entire force was within their field of fire, before ambushing it at close range with small arms fire from Bren light machine guns, rifles, grenades and mortars. The convoy was subsequently scattered and the KPA fled, abandoning their vehicles with only the tank successfully shooting its way out. Among the KPA dead was the commanding officer of the Reconnaissance Unit of the 17th Tank Brigade, Lieutenant Colonel Kim In-sik, who was carrying a number of marked maps and documents. These items were of considerable intelligence value and they revealed that the KPA were preparing a last line of defence at Chongju away, with infantry supported by tanks. Later another KPA T-34 tank and supporting infantry pressed to within of the B Company headquarters, before stopping and taking up a position between the ridges still unaware of the location of the Australians. An attempt by the Australian infantrymen to engage the tank with a new M20 3.5-inch bazooka failed however after the weapon misfired, and it subsequently withdrew out of range. The tank then continued to fire randomly for the remainder of the night, without effect. In reserve, C Company was subsequently woken during the battle to send a number of their bazookas forward to replace those used by B Company as it was suspected that theirs were faulty due to being poorly maintained. However, in their first close engagement with KPA armour, it was possible that some of the Australians had simply forgotten to move the safety catches of their bazookas to the firing position in their excitement. Following firm directions the bazookas were used to good effect by 3 RAR in a number of encounters with tanks during the next few days. Regardless, despite using infantry mounted on tanks the KPA seemed unable to conduct the sort of organised or co-ordinated assault required to dislodge the Australians, and they were relatively untroubled for the rest of the night. 27th British Commonwealth Brigade consolidates, 26 October 1950 alt=A truck sits imobile in mud and water, while soldiers and civilians look on. In the background is a damaged bridge. By dawn the Australians were still in possession of the bridgehead across the Taeryong. A large number of undamaged KPA vehicles were subsequently found in front of their positions and they were soon pressed into service. At 07:00 a further airstrike by USAF F-80s was called-in on the KPA holding the ridges to the west of the 3 RAR positions, and they were subsequently strafed and attacked with napalm. With the way reported clear, C and D Companies crossed the river from the eastern bank later that morning. C Company subsequently took up a defensive position a few hundred metres forward of A Company on the left of the road, while D Company crossed the river at Pakchon and advanced to occupy a dominant hill on the battalion's right flank. In spite of harassment by the KPA during the previous evening which had cost D Company four casualties, the American engineers at Pakchon had continued to work on the underwater bridge and the Sherman tanks were able to cross there by 11:00 that morning, although the water was still considered too deep for wheeled vehicles. The battle continued during the morning; however, by 12:00 the KPA finally withdrew, abandoning the bridge to the Australians. Meanwhile, Coad put two companies from the Argylls across the Taeryong River on tanks at the Pakchon ford, and they met only slight opposition. The Middlesex then passed through them, moving south-west onto the main road in front of 3 RAR where they knocked out a KPA tank which was blocking their advance. By nightfall they had linked up with the Australians, consolidating their positions and securing a safe crossing for the remainder of the brigade, including the wheeled vehicles which followed that evening. KPA patrols attempted to harass the British and Australian outposts; however, despite their perimeter being shelled it proved to be a relatively quiet night for the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade. Aftermath Casualties To the Australians the fighting at Kujin became known as the \\"Battle of the Broken Bridge\\", and resulted in them securing a bridgehead across the Taeryong River, allowing the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade to continue its advance towards the Yalu River. KPA casualties included 100 killed and 350 captured, while the Australian losses, which included their first battle fatalities of the war in Korea, were eight killed and 22 wounded. The dead were subsequently interred in a Christian churchyard in Pakchon and were later moved to a cemetery in Pyongyang. Among those captured by the Australians was at least one Chinese soldier, and although the significance of this was not recognised at the time it was undoubtedly a sign of events that would later alter the course of the war. Indeed, during the last weeks of October the Chinese had moved 18 divisions of the People's Volunteer Army across the Yalu River under the overall command of Marshal Peng Dehuai. Undetected by US and South Korean intelligence, the 13th Army Group crossed the border on 16 October and penetrated up to into North Korea. Subsequent operations Chinese forces cross the Yalu River. Meanwhile, on 27 October the Middlesex continued the brigade's advance, and was involved in a sharp fight in the hills west of the river near the village of Yongsong-ni, killing 35 KPA and capturing 80 prisoners, while American aircraft destroyed 10 KPA T-34 tanks and two SU-76 self-propelled guns. The following day the Argylls took over as the lead battalion. Intelligence indicated that the British and Australians were facing the KPA 17th Tank Brigade, equipped with 20 tanks, and although the KPA had suffered heavy casualties during the previous fighting on the Taeryong River, Coad was now forced to adopt more cautious tactics as a result, advancing in shorter bounds and clearing high points en route. With the war considered all but over the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade continued to pursue the KPA towards Chongju over the next three days; however, the advance increasingly encountered strong resistance from KPA infantry dug-in with tanks and self- propelled guns in support as they approached the Yalu River on the Manchurian border. 3 RAR took over as lead battalion of the brigade on 29 October, from Chongju. That morning a spotter aircraft reported a large KPA formation consisting of a battalion-sized force of 500‚Äì600 infantry supported by several tanks and at least two self-propelled guns, positioned on a thickly wooded ridgeline around Chongju. The Battle of Chongju ensued as the Australians dislodged the strong KPA armoured force and then defended their positions against KPA counterattacks during the evening.

This watershed begins at Kinsey Marsh, draining via Murray Creek into American Lake. Seasonal overflow from American Lake feeds Sequalitchew Lake. The water level of both lakes is maintained year-round by springs and water table seepage. A diversion dam, built by Fort Lewis around 1950, lies near the headwaters of the Creek. The dam drains through a canal that originates in Hamer Marsh, east of the Creek. Just south of Sequalitchew Lake, the canal passes under the Creek through a series of complicated culverts. It continues west for one mile (1.6 km), and turns north to empty into Puget Sound at Tatsolo Point, off Steilacoom-DuPont Road, DuPont.

Proposed mining expansion A proposed expansion of Glacier Northwest's (recently renamed as Cal-Portland, previously known as Lone Star Gravel) existing gravel mine will involve the removal of of forest and topsoil surrounding Sequalitchew Creek. If allowed, it will create a hole in the underlying gravel as 40 million tons of gravel is extracted over the next 14 years. The pit will be deep and expose the underlying Vashon Aquifer. The flow from this exposed aquifer (estimated at approximately 6.5 million gallons per day) will be directed down a man made ditch to Sequalitchew Creek with a flow eight times that of present Sequalitchew Creek. The dewatering of the aquifer will lower the groundwater level in the vicinity by as much as , thereby draining nearby Edmonds Marsh, a Class I wetland.Glacier NW Pioneer Aggregate Mine Expansion Staff Report Nearby Pond Lake, McKay Marsh, Bell Marsh and Hammer Marsh will be adversely affected.Ground Water and Surface Water Flow Summary DuPont staff recommendation On January 16, 2009, Bill Kingman, DuPont Planning Department signed on behalf of the City of DuPont to accept the proposed mining expansion as follows, (directly quoting): Approval of expansion of the aggregate mine into the area proposed is recommended, but with conditions that change some of the characteristics of the proposal. This approval would include: #Expansion of aggregate removal throughout the proposed would be allowed. #Groundwater aquifer dewatering to lower the water table for access to additional aggregate would be allowed. This initially would be accomplished through interceptor wells. In the long term, construction of a portion of the proposed new North Sequalitchew Creek channel would permanently intercept groundwater and discharge to the existing Sequalitchew Creek. #Mitigation for potential groundwater aquifer drawdown impacts on Edmond Marsh would be accomplished by replacing invasive vegetation by native vegetation that will result in equal or greater wetland function and values. #Removal of the ‚ÄúKettle Wetland‚Äù would be allowed with mitigation consisting of creation of replacement wetlands that may be located adjacent to the proposed new North Sequalitchew Creek channel. #Displacement of wetland functions at the Seep and Riparian Forest wetlands adjacent to Sequalitchew Creek due to interception of groundwater from the excavation for aggregate removal would be approved with mitigation consisting of replacement wetlands. #The conditions of approval would not allow the excavation of the north side of the existing Sequalitchew Creek ravine but would, instead, require installation of a bored pipeline approximately long.Staff Recommendation: Glacier Northwest, Pioneer Aggregate Mine Expansion City File No‚Äôs, CUP 07-01, LU 07-01, SA 07-01 Glacier Northwest's current Conditional Use Permit to expand the mine, and dewater the aquifer and creek violates the 1994 Settlement Agreement as established by the Nisqually Delta Association.

He was the general manager and then chairman of the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), before being appointed the director of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) in March 2013. He was also a member of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. In September 2013, Jiang was abruptly removed from his post and came under investigation for corruption and abuse of power, along with four other senior oil executives. Jiang was considered an ally of former security chief Zhou Yongkang, and part of a group of officials that had political ties with Zhou. In June 2014, Jiang was expelled from the Communist Party of China; he was convicted on charges of abuse of power and bribery and sentenced to 16 years in prison. Career Jiang Jiemin graduated from Shandong University in Industrial Economics Management. In August 1976, Jiang joined the Communist Party of China. Jiang was made Deputy Director of the Shengli Petroleum Administration Bureau in March 1993, Senior Executive of the Qinghai Petroleum Administration Bureau in June 1994, and Director of the Qinghai Petroleum Administration Bureau in November 1994. In February 1999 he was made Assistant to the General Manager and the team leader in charge of the preparation for the initial public offering of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). In November of that year he was promoted again, to Director and Vice President of PetroChina, a subsidiary of CNPC. From there his career went to Qinghai Province, as deputy governor and member of the provincial Party Standing Committee in June 2000. In June 2001, he became Deputy Party Secretary of Qinghai province. In April 2004, he was transferred back to CNPC, as Deputy General Manager and Vice Chairman; in May he was made President of PetroChina, and in November 2006 General Manager of CNPC. In May 2007 he became the Chairman of PetroChina. In May 2008, he stepped down from the position.Executive Profile of Jiang Jiemin, archived on May 27, 2008. Accessed on March 20, 2015. Jiang was reported to have faced unusual public criticism from small investors after PetroChina's share price fell sharply due partly to the government's control of retail fuel prices. The Times noted that he was a key figure in \\"China's determined expansion of its energy empire overseas.\\"The Sunday Times, \\"The top 10 Chinese firms that will challenge the West\\", March 9, 2008.

In November 2012, the South China Morning Post reported that in the aftermath of the Ferrari death of Ling Gu, the 23-year- old son of Ling Jihua, top aide to former Party General Secretary Hu Jintao, Jiang wired hush money from the company's accounts to the families of the two women who were accompanying Ling Gu at the time of his death. Jiang was an alternate member of the 17th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and a full member of the 18th Central Committee. He was expelled from the Central Committee at the Third Plenum in 2014. Corruption investigation On September 1, 2013, Jiang was detained by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the party's anti-graft agency, on suspicion of corruption, and was removed from his post as Chairman of SASAC. It was widely speculated that Jiang's case was part of a bigger corruption probe whose ultimate target was former Politburo Standing Committee member Zhou Yongkang. Jiang (after former Sichuan deputy Party chief Li Chuncheng) was the second high-ranking official associated with Zhou detained following the 18th Party Congress. On June 30, 2014, Jiang was expelled from the Communist Party of China. Authorities announced at the conclusion of the investigation that Jiang \\"abused his power for the illicit gain of others,\\" and \\"solicited and received massive bribes.\\"ËíãÊ¥ÅÊïè‰∏•ÈáçËøùÁ∫™ËøùÊ≥ïË¢´ÂºÄÈô§ÂÖöÁ±ç, ifeng. June 30, 2014 On March 19, 2015, Jiang was indicted on charges of bribery, large amounts of property from unknown source and abuse of power. According to Zhou Ruijin, a former editor in chief of Communist Party's flagship newspaper People's Daily, Jiang Jiemin was part of a \\"network of vice and corruption\\" along with Zhou Yongkang, Bo Xilai, Xu Caihou, Ling Jihua, and Li Dongsheng.\\" They could almost blot out the sky and cover the earth,\\" Zhou said in an interview with the Chinese business magazine Caijing. On October 12, 2015, the court found Jiang guilty on all counts, including accepting bribes, unidentified huge property, abuses of power, and sentenced him to 16 years in prison.

It is the site of a long-term planned urban development which would take advantage of proximity to the existing cities of Tijuana to the north west and Mexicali to the north east to create a similar sized city of one million people by the year 2030, on Mexican Federal Highway 3 around an existing industrial park and university campus Unidad Valle De Las Palmas. The first project in Valle de las Palmas, named Valle San Pedro, is proposed by the Mexican Federal Government, the State of Baja California, Urbi (land developer and homebuilder) and Banobras. It has been certified as the first Integral Sustainable Urban Development or DUIS in Mexico, which establishes criteria in collaboration with Interamerican Development Bank IDB to evaluate projects that will receive inter-secretarial technical support and public investment. The locality reported a population of 1,860 inhabitants in the 2010 federal census. It is located at an altitude of 282 m. (925 ft.) above sea level. Industrialization direction This can be surmised from the courses of instruction offered by the University as Aerospace, Computers, Microelectronics and Renewable Energy. Transport Valle de Las Palmas is on Mexican Federal Highway 3 running north from Ensenada, Baja California and is south of the city of Tecate which city is on a spur of the toll road linking Tijuana with Mexicali across the central Sierra. It is also on the older two- lane east-west road which is toll-free. Air travel The city of Tecate is home for the Tecate Airport, which no longer operates due to low traffic. As the development of Valle Las Palmas occurs it will cause increased traffic causing the Tecate airport to reopen. Instead, Tecate municipio residents are served by the nearby Tijuana International Airport, closer to Tecate than Mexicali International Airport, used to a lesser extent.

The original lineup also included John Kadlecik of the Dark Star Orchestra on lead guitar, Jeff Chimenti of RatDog on keyboards, Jay Lane of RatDog on percussion, and Joe Russo of the Benevento/Russo Duo on drums. Named after the famous touring bus used by Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters in the 1960s, Furthur was an improvisational jam band that performed music primarily from the extensive Grateful Dead songbook, as well as their own original music and that of several other well-known artists. In addition to the original members (with the exception of Jay Lane, who left the band in March 2010 to rejoin his previous band, Primus), the band's lineup included backup vocalists Sunshine Becker of the a cappella ensemble SoVoS√≥ and Jeff Pehrson of the folk rock bands Box Set and the Fall Risk. History Four months after Jerry Garcia's death in August 1995, the Grateful Dead officially disbanded. However, band members continued to perform over the subsequent years in other bands such as RatDog, Phil Lesh and Friends, the Rhythm Devils, the Other Ones, and the Dead. After a four-year hiatus following their \\"Wave That Flag\\" summer tour in 2004, the Dead performed two 2008 shows supporting the Obama campaign, billed as \\"Deadheads for Obama\\" and \\"Change Rocks\\", as well at one of the Obama inaugural balls in 2009, ultimately giving rise to a 2009 spring tour. During this reunion, Weir and Lesh, who admitted having great fun playing together again, decided to form a new band. In August 2009, the musicians announced that they had formed a new band, Furthur, with Kadlecik, Chimenti, Lane, and Russo. The band was named after the 1939 International Harvester psychedelic multicolored bus used by novelist Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters to tour America in 1964 when they attended the New York World's Fair for the debut of Kesey's second novel, Sometimes A Great Notion. \\"Furthur\\" was the inscription on the destination placard of the bus and was also the name given to the multicolored bus. \\"In many ways, the 'Furthur' destination of the bus‚Äîpiloted by Neal Cassady, inspiration for the character Dean Moriarty in Jack Kerouac's On the Road‚Äîrepresented the mind-set of the transition from Beat Generation culture to the more heavily drug-infused hippie culture and the LSD-based psychedelic culture, with Ken Kesey, Neal Cassady, the Merry Pranksters, and the Grateful Dead‚Äîall alumni of the Acid Tests‚Äîas ambassadors and guides on that cognitive and conceptual journey\\". The Grateful Dead performed as the house band for many of the Acid Tests, which ran from 1965 to 1966. Furthur retained much of the characteristic style and texture of the Dead. In addition to performing many of the songs regularly played in concert by the Dead, Furthur tried to \\"keep it fresh\\" by routinely adding new material to their setlists. This included many songs resurrected from the Grateful Dead's extensive songbook, including several rarely or never performed live, like \\"Alice D. Millionaire\\", as well as several cover songs from bands including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, the Band, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Ryan Adams, Van Morrison and the Clash. They also regularly performed some new, original material. Performances 2009 The band debuted with performances on September 18, 19, and 20, 2009, at the Fox Theatre in Oakland, California. The band Vice (now known as Maiden Lane), featuring Phil's son, Grahame, opened for Furthur on Saturday, September 19. They then performed for a single night on November 20 at the 200-person-capacity 19 Broadway in Fairfax, California, advertised only by a last-minute announcement, and with tickets available only at the door on a first come, first served basis. The Oakland debut shows were followed by five additional concerts in the Northeast (New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey) in December 2009, as well as live rehearsal sessions and two New Year's shows in Mill Valley, California, and San Francisco, respectively. During the New Year's Eve performances, the band introduced backing vocalists Sunshine Becker and Zoe Ellis, who remained in the lineup for the remainder of the winter tour. Furthur performing their debut show at the Fox Theatre in Oakland, CA on September 18, 2009 2010 Additional live rehearsal sessions continued for the first half of January 2010 in Mill Valley. The band then toured the U.S. (primarily East Coast, with a few shows in Miami, Chicago, Broomfield, Colorado, and Portland, Oregon) from February 2 through March 8, 2010, and performed in San Francisco on March 12, 2010 to celebrate Phil Lesh's upcoming 70th birthday. On March 18, 2010, Phil Lesh posted on popular fansite PhilZone.com an announcement that drummer Jay Lane had left Furthur to rejoin his prior group, Primus. Zoe Ellis also left the group at this time to focus on her a cappella ensemble, SoVoS√≥. Backup vocalist Jeff Pehrson subsequently joined Furthur, debuting May 24, 2010. In February 2010, official announcements were released that the group would be performing at three music festivals in the summer of 2010, including the Nateva Music & Camping Festival in Oxford, Maine, on July 4, the All Good Music Festival in Masontown, West Virginia, on July 9, and the Gathering of the Vibes festival in Bridgeport, Connecticut, on July 30. Additional stops on the tour, which ran from June 25 until July 30 and included 17 shows, included Rochester, New York, Brooklyn, Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, Lowell, Massachusetts, Columbus, Ohio, Mohawk, New York, Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania (which replaced a canceled show in Shelburne, Vermont), Ottawa, Lewiston, New York, Philadelphia, and New York. In addition to the three festivals on the East Coast, Furthur resurrected the \\"Furthur Festival\\" at Mountain Aire in Angels Camp, California on Memorial Day weekend May 28-30th, 2010, at which they played six of their classic albums live. Following a performance on August 14, 2010 in Golden Gate Park at the Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival, Furthur initiated their first West Coast tour, commencing September 16, 2010 in Eugene, Oregon, and ending September 26, 2010 in Morrison, Colorado, at Red Rocks Amphitheatre. A short Midwest/East Coast tour followed, beginning on November 8, 2010 in Minneapolis and ending on November 21, 2010 at Madison Square Garden in New York. Two New Year's shows concluded the year, with Furthur having performed a total of 77 shows and 18 live rehearsal sessions since their September 2009 inception. 2011 Furthur began 2011 with three shows at the Odeum Colorado in February 2011 (announced December 3, 2010), followed shortly thereafter by a 24-show East Coast tour (announced January 6, 2011) beginning on March 4 in Boston and ending on April 6 in Boca Raton, Florida. This tour featured several multi- night runs in mid-size venues including five nights at Best Buy Theater in New York, five nights at Tower Theater in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania (outside Philadelphia), and three nights at Radio City Music Hall in New York. The 2011 summer tour (announced on April 8, 2011) began on June 3 at Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California, and concluded on July 31 at Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre at Encore Park in Alpharetta, Georgia, with the bulk of the shows on the East Coast. A 2011 West Coast tour (announced on June 4, 2011) began on September 23 at Cuthbert Amphitheatre in Eugene, Oregon, and ended on October 8 at Monterey County Fairgrounds in Monterey, California. A 2011 East Coast/Midwest fall tour (announced on September 9, 2011) began November 3 at Verizon Wireless Arena in Manchester, New Hampshire, and ended November 21 at Old National Center in Indianapolis. Due to \\"unforeseen production complications\\", the November 15 show at the Bryce Jordan Center in State College, Pennsylvania, was canceled and replaced with a performance the same day at the Times Union Center in Albany, New York. A three-show New Year's Eve run (announced on October 14, 2011) took place on December 29, 30, and 31 at Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco. 2012 A 2012 East Coast spring tour (announced on December 9, 2011), which included only three venues, began on April 5 at Wang Theatre in Boston and ended with an eight-night run at the Beacon Theatre in New York, including an April 7 show at Toyota Presents: The Oakdale Theatre in Wallingford, Connecticut. Preceding the spring tour Furthur played two shows at the Wanee Festival in Live Oak, Florida, on April 20‚Äì21. The band played a rare single \\"extended\\" set show both nights with no set break. For the April 21 show Jeff Chimenti did not play the Hammond B3 organ because of the rain. A warm up before the summer tour took place at Phil Lesh's Terrapin Crossroads June 27‚Äì30. A summer tour of the East and Midwest (announced on March 2, 2012) took place in July. The tour began at McCoy Stadium in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, on July 5 and ended at the Meadow Brook Music Festival in Rochester Hills, Michigan, on July 18. A West Coast Tour in September began with a 3-night run at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado and ended on October 7 at the Santa Barbara Bowl in Santa Barbara, California. Furthur's traditional New Year's Eve run took place on December 29, 30, and 31 at Bill Graham Civic Auditorium. 2013 Furthur began touring in 2013 with four surprise shows at the tiny Sweetwater Music Hall in Mill Valley, California on January 16, 17, 18, and 19. They later booked a winter tour, on which they played at only two venues: the Ogden Theatre in Denver on February 21, and the 1stBank Center in Broomfield, Colorado on the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th. In April Furthur began a spring tour with ten nights at the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, New York on April 15-25, a show at the Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City on the 27th, originally culminating in an appearance at the BottleRock Napa Valley Festival on May 9. The band withdrew from Bottlerock, due to injuries guitarist Bob Weir sustained after a fall on the final night of the Capitol Theatre run. Furthur has also announced a summer/autumn tour, starting at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn on July 11 and ending at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles on October 6. During this tour Furthur played at All Good music festival in Thornville, Ohio July 20 and 21. Furthur also began their early fall tour by headlining 3 nights (4 sets) at the first Lockn' Music Festival in Arrington Virginia on September 6, 7 and 8. Furthur then played four nights at Red Rocks, in Morrison, Colorado, starting with the full moon show September 19 and concluding on Sunday, September 22 with guest Branford Marsalis. 2014 Furthur announced that they would be taking a hiatus in 2014 so that Bob and Phil might do some solo projects. On April 30, 2014 it was announced that Furthur would be playing their only set of 2014 at the Lockn festival in Virginia. This performance was to feature the original Furthur lineup consisting of Phil Lesh, Bob Weir, Jeff Chimenti, John Kadlecik, Jay Lane, and Joe Russo. This performance was later cancelled. On November 4, 2014, it was announced via their website that Furthur had broken up. Special appearances On Monday, August 9, 2010, the San Francisco Giants held a Jerry Garcia Tribute Night at AT&T; Park, sponsored by Ben & Jerry's, the Rex Foundation, and the 8th Annual Jerry Day. The Giants played the Chicago Cubs, and the National Anthem was sung by Phil Lesh, Bob Weir, and Jeff Pehrson. Later that season, the Giants played the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League Championship Series, and on Thursday, October 21, 2010 (Game 5 of the NLCS), the National Anthem was once again sung by Lesh, Weir, and Pehrson. The following year, on Tuesday, August 9, 2011, the Giants celebrated the 2nd annual Grateful Dead Night (on Jerry Day), playing the Pittsburgh Pirates. The National Anthem was sung by Lesh, Weir, and Giants' 3rd base coach and singer-songwriter Tim Flannery, and the 7th inning stretch was led by Mickey Hart and Bill Walton. On Tuesday, June 7, 2011, Furthur performed live at Tamalpais Research Institute (a.k.a. TRI Studios) in San Rafael, California. TRI is a virtual music venue created by Bob Weir. The event, billed as \\"Furthur Experiments at TRI\\", was broadcast in real time over the internet in HD video with stereo sound and was available to those who ordered the pay-per-view event for $19.95. The performance included 13 songs (counting Terrapin Suite as one song), had no break, and lasted about two-and- a-half hours, beginning 6:00PM PDT. On December 23, 2011, TRI rebroadcast, without charge, the June 7, 2011 Furthur event, rebilled as \\"The Night Before the Night Before Christmas\\", at 4:00 PM PST and 7:00 PM PST. On December 25, 2011, TRI announced that RatDog will reunite for a free webcast on January 25, 2011 at 5:00 PM PST. On March 29, 2011, Phil Lesh posted a statement on the Furthur.net site community message board that he was planning to open a new live music venue in Marin County, California, in the near future. Said Lesh, \\"We're taking the first steps to make a long time dream‚Äîa permanent musical home‚Äîcome true. We are purchasing a building in Marin, and plan on remodeling it to feel like an old barn; we're calling it Terrapin Landing.

The grant encompassed present day Vacaville, all of Lagoon Valley and stretched into what is now, Yolo County almost to Davis. It also reached into the Vaca Mountains. History Juan Felipe Pe√±a ( - 1863) and Juan Manuel Vaca (1782‚Äì1856) came from New Mexico to California with the Workman-Rowland Party in 1841. Pe√±a came with his wife, Isabella Gonsalves and their six children. Vaca's wife died in 1839, but he was accompanied by their eight children. Vaca married Estefano Martinez in 1845. General Vallejo is credited with recommending the Lagoon Valley area to Vaca and Pe√±a. The Los Putos grant of 10 square leagues was made in 1843 by Governor Micheltorena. The grant was originally called Rancho Lihuaytos - which was the name of Putah Creek at that time. The grant overlapped the Rancho Rio de los Putos grant of William Wolfskill, and in 1845, Governor Pio Pico made a correcting grant 10 square leagues. 59 US 556 The United States v. Juan Manuel Vaca and Juan Felipe Pe√±a With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican- American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho Los Putos was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1853,United States. District Court (California : Northern District) Land Case 74 ND and the grant was patented to Juan Felipe Pe√±a and Juan Manuel Vaca in 1858. Report of the Surveyor General 1844 - 1886 The first sales of Rancho property began in 1849, when Vaca sold a half-league of land between Alamo Creek and Ulatis Creek to John Patton and Albert Lyon. In 1850 Pe√±a sold a half-league to Jacob David Hoppe and Zimri Hollingsworth. Then in 1850, came the history making sale, when Vaca sold one square league (about 9 square miles) of land to William McDaniel with the provision that one square mile (640 acres) would be used to create a township called Vacaville. Vaca received about half of subdivided lots in the town. McDaniel's partner was the Benicia attorney Lansing B. Mizner. In exchange for laying out the town and tending to the legal paperwork, Mizner received half of the land in the deal with Vaca. Vaca could not speak, read, write English, but Mizner, fluent in both Spanish and English, was the interpreter for the transaction. It might be noted that McDaniel was a federal land agent and it was against the laws of the land for him to be involved in purchasing land. Pe√±a was upset, and it was the cause of the major quarrel between Pe√±a and Vaca. In response, Pe√±a received two hundred lots in the town of Vacaville. Vaca was also upset about the McDaniel deal. He said he had believed he was signing over only one square mile. Vaca posted in the Benicia newspaper: ‚ÄúCaution. I hereby notify all persons not to purchase any lands from William McDaniel, which he claims to have purchased from me under a title which he obtained from me under false pretenses, and I shall institute suit against him to annul the title so fraudulently obtained by him. Manual Vaca‚Äù. McDaniel sued Vaca for libel and the loss of a land sale. The jury found Vaca guilty of libel, but the California Supreme Court overturned the decision, ruling that Vaca's newspaper warning was something that ‚Äúevery freeman and freeholder would be justified in making if the circumstances raised a strong presumption that the fraud had been attempted upon him to get possession of his estate‚Äù. After Vaca and Pe√±a argued over the William McDaniel land sale, Vaca sold his adobe to John Wesley Hill. Juan Manual Vaca died in 1856. Pe√±a died in 1863, leaving his land to his children and the adobe to his only daughter, Nestora Pe√±a Rivera (who married Jesus Tapia Rivera), along with . His wife Isabella stayed at the adobe until she died in 1884. A survey correcting the boundaries of the William Wolfskill Rio de los Putos grant and the Vaca-Pe√±a Rancho was made in 1858. Adjustments had to be made to the original boundary lines of the grant. The boundary lines were finally established as a twisted and elongated configuration.David Vaught, 2004, \\"A Tale of Three Land Grants on the Northern California Borderlands,\\" Agricultural History, Vol. 78, No. 2 (Spring, 2004), pp. 140‚Äì154 The legal fees for the years 1853 through to the official United States patent in 1858, were paid in land. They turned large parcels of land to pay taxes. By 1855, the tax rolls show only of the original Vaca-Pe√±a grant remaining in the original owners‚Äô hands. By 1880 most of the land grant was sold.

Its main character is a Parisian perfumer who achieves success in the cosmetics business, but becomes bankrupt due to property speculation. Writing and Publication Balzac kept a rough draft of the novel for six years before completing it in 1837 after being offered 20,000 Francs by Le Figaro, provided it was ready to appear before December 15 that year. Explaining the delay he would later write \\"For six years I have kept a rough draft of C√©sar Birotteau despairing of ever being able to interest anyone in the character of a rather stupid, somewhat mediocre shopkeeper, whose misfortunes are commonplace, symbolising that world of the small Parisian tradesman which we so often ridicule ...\\".Buss, \\"Introduction\\", pp. xi-xii Plot summary C√©sar is a man of peasant origins from the Touraine region. At the start of the novel, in 1819, he owns a successful perfume shop, La Reine des Roses, he has been elected deputy mayor of his arrondissement in Paris, and he has been awarded the Legion of Honour. During the revolution he took part in the Royalist 13 Vend√©miaire uprising against the Republic, at one stage confronting Napoleon Bonaparte himself, and he mentions this often in conversation. He is married to Constance and has a daughter Cesarine. He plans to throw a ball at his home, and make renovations to his home for the ball. He becomes involved in property speculation with borrowed money, through his notary Roguin. He plans to expand his business with a new hair oil product, with his assistant Anselme Popinot (who is in love with Cesarine) as his business partner. All of these plans have caused him to run up large debts. What he does not realise is that Roguin has money problems of his own, and that C√©sar's former shop assistant Ferdinand du Tillet, now a banker, is manipulating Roguin in order to have revenge against C√©sar. His financial situation becomes a crisis when Roguin absconds and leaves C√©sar with debts that he is not able to pay. His attempts to get financial assistance from various bankers such as Nucingen, the Keller brothers and Gigonnet (all recurring characters in La Com√©die humaine) fail, since all are friends of du Tillet and acting on his instructions. This leads him to declare bankruptcy, sell La Reine des Roses to his assistant Celestin Crevel and retire from business. Eventually C√©sar pays off all of his debts when his business venture with Popinot succeeds. He then dies suddenly, but happy that his honour has been restored. Themes The novel is a partly satirical, partly sympathetic portrayal of the Parisian middle class. Balzac writes \\"..may the present history be the poem of those vicissitudes of bourgeois life that no voice has thought to sing, so much are they denuded of grandeur, though by the same token immense: what we speak of here is not a single man, but a whole nation of suffering.\\"C√©sar Birotteau, chapter 2, translated by Robin Buss. The world of high finance is also explored through C√©sar's visits to the bankers du Tillet, the Kellers, Nucingen and Gigonnet during the second half of the book. Chapter 14 is titled \\"A General History of Bankruptcy\\", and here Balzac explains the bankruptcy laws as they existed in his time, and how they were frequently abused by dishonest businessmen who wanted to escape their debts. C√©sar is shown to be an exception in that he chooses to honour all of his debts.C√©sar Birotteau, chapter 14, translated by Robin Buss.

Wilding was third choice for leading man after Rex Harrison and John Mills. Plot During an air-raid on Piccadilly, Chief Officer Diana Fraser, who is on active duty with the Women's Royal Naval Service, meets Captain Alan Pearson, a Royal Marines officer on sick leave after the evacuation from Dunkirk. He invites her for a drink at his house - they dance and fall in love. Impulsively, he proposes to her and they marry. Alan is posted to North Africa and Diana to Singapore. As Singapore falls to the Japanese, she is evacuated, but the ship in which she is travelling is attacked and she is presumed drowned. However, she and four other passengers survive, including Bill Weston, a Canadian sailor who loves her. Two years later, they are rescued after their boat is spotted by an American aeroplane. Fraser returns home to find that her husband has remarried to an American Red Cross nurse, Joan, and they have a son. She is devastated and flees the house after meeting the wife. Diana approaches Alan backstage at a Navy show. She pretends that the marriage meant little to her and that she has another man with whom she became involved when stranded on the island.

He hoped to use the same leads, Anna Neagle and Rex Harrison, but the success of Grosvenor Square saw Harrison offered a contract with 20th Century Fox. Wilcox offered the role to John Mills, who turned it down. He accepted Michael Wilding reluctantly at the suggestion of Wilding's agent, but once he saw Wilding and Neagle play their first scene together, he put Wilding under a personal long-term contract.

It was an all-weather temporary field built by the United States Army Air Force XII Engineer Command using a graded earth compacted surface, with a prefabricated hessian (burlap) surfacing known as PHS. PHS was made of an asphalt-impregnated jute which was rolled out over the compacted surface over a square mesh track (SMT) grid of wire joined in 3-inch squares. Pierced Steel Planking was also used for parking areas, as well as for dispersal sites, when it was available. In addition, tents were used for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with a drinkable water and minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting. Once completed it was turned over for use by the Twelfth Air Force 324th Fighter Group, 14 June and 19 July 1944, P-40 Warhawk During the Invasion of Southern France (Operation Dragoon), the airfield may have been used by elements of the 314th Troop Carrier Group in mid-August 1944 After the Americans moved out the airfield was dismantled. Today, traces of the runway are visible in aerial photographs, but the landscape is predominantly agriculture which has erased the remainder of the airfield. References * Maurer, Maurer.

It grows on trees and rocks, mostly in swamps and near streams in eastern Australia. Description Bulbophyllum minutissimum is an epiphytic or lithophytic herb with crowded, reddish or green, flattened spherical pseudobulbs that are in diameter. The pseudobulbs contain stomata on their inner surface, which minimizes surface area and the loss of water by transpiration. Each pseudobulb has a single linear to lance-shaped, papery, scale-like leaf about long. A single flower about long and wide is borne on a thread-like flowering stem about long. The flowers are whitish to reddish with broad dark red stripes and have a pimply or hairy ovary. The sepals are long and wide, the petals about long and wide. The labellum is red, about long and wide, curved and fleshy. Flowering occurs from October to November. Taxonomy and naming The red bead orchid was first formally described in 1865 by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name Dendrobium minutissimum and published the description in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae, but in 1878 he changed the name to Bulbophyllum minutissimum. The specific epithet (minutissimum) is the superlative form of the Latin word minutus meaning \\"little\\" or \\"small\\", hence \\"smallest\\". Distribution and habitat Bulbophyllum minutissimum grows on trees and rocks in wet places, including swamps, stream banks and mangroves. It occurs between the Blackdown Tableland in Queensland and Milton in New South Wales.

Over 44% of this household waste was organic, with 24.7% (or 258,886 tonnes) of the total being kitchen waste, and 19.6% being greenwaste (205,526 tonnes).http://www.wasteminz.org.nz/pubs/2013-report-on-food-waste-in-new- zealand/ More detailed research into food waste generated by households, that was disposed of through curbside rubbish collections, was conducted by Waste Not Consulting in 2014 on behalf of WasteMINZ.WasteMINZhttp://www.wasteminz.org.nz/pubs/new-zealand-food-waste- audits-2014-2015/ The rubbish bins of 1,402 households were studied with their food waste sorted, weighed and costed. The study found that 229,022 tonnes of food is sent to landfill by households annually. Of this approximately 50% or 122,547 tonnes is avoidable food waste. The national cost of avoidable household food waste disposed of to landfill in 2014/2015 was $872 million pa. Eliminating this food waste would have the same effect as reducing CO2 equivalent emissions by 325,975 tonnes ‚Äì equivalent to planting 130,390 trees or taking 118,107 cars off the road for a year. This research was repeated in 2018 with the rubbish bins of 600 households audited. The study found that on average, New Zealand households were throwing away 3.15 kg of food a week via their domestic kerbside collection. This is down from 3.17 kg of food waste from bin audits conducted in 2014-2015 by Waste Not Consulting. Due primarily to population growth over that time period 157,398 tonnes of avoidable food waste is being landfilled each year. The average New Zealand household in 2018 wasted $644 worth of food pa approximately 86 kilos. 42.4 kg of avoidable food waste found in New Zealand household rubbish bins in 2014 The top ten foods wasted in 2018 were: # Bread 10% # Left overs 8% # Oranges and Mandarins 4% # Apples 3% # Bananas 3% # Potatoes 3% #Poultry 3% #Rice 3% # Lettuces 2% # Beef 2%. Statistics on exactly how much edible food is wasted by households and composted, fed to animals or disposed of through a kitchen waste disposal unit is not known. A 2014 survey of 1,365 households found that 66% of those surveyed disposed of some of their food through the council kerbside collection, with 47% disposing of some of their food through composting, 35% through feeding animals and 28% through a kitchen disposal unit.http://www.wasteminz.org.nz/pubs/national-food-waste-prevention-study- into-attidutes-towards-food-waste/ The Love Food Hate Waste Campaign launched in New Zealand on 1 June 2016. The campaign supports families to waste less food by encouraging behaviours to reduce food waste such as using leftovers and correct storage of food. An evaluation of the campaign conducted in 2018 found that households who had heard of the campaign have decreased their food waste to landfill by 27.1%. Perceptions of food waste In 2014 a survey of 1,354 households was undertaken by WasteMINZ and people were asked how much food they thought they wasted and how much their weekly shopping bill was. People thought they bought $140 worth of food per week in their grocery shop and they estimated they wasted 5%. So the total amount they thought they wasted was $390 per household per year which equates to $600 million per year A study was undertaken in 2017 by Rabobank with similar questions asked. People thought they bought $180 worth of food per week in their grocery shop and they estimated they wasted 12%. So the total amount they thought they wasted was $1,071 per household which equates to $1.8 billion per year. It is unclear whether this increased perception of the amount wasted correlates to an actual increase in the amount wasted. The survey conducted by WasteMINZ in 2014 was repeated using the same survey methodology. People thought they bought $150 worth of food per week in their grocery shop a $10 increase and they estimated they wasted 5% no change with 2014. This suggests that the increased estimate of food waste by Rabobank is due to a difference in survey methodology rather than an actual increase. Supermarket food waste Research has been conducted into supermarket food waste in New Zealand by the University of Otago. Physical waste audits were conducted at New World, Countdown and PAK'nSAVE supermarkets around New Zealand in 2017. In total it is estimated that 60,500 tonnes of food are wasted per annum by supermarkets in New Zealand. This equates to approximately 160 tonnes per store per annum. 15% of supermarket food waste is donated to food rescue groups and only 23% is sent to landfill with the balance sent to animal feed 46% or protein reprocessing 15%. The most wasted foods are # Vegetables 27% # Bakery 23% # Meat and Fish 19% # Fruit 17% In New Zealand it is permitted to send food waste to pig farmers though the Biosecurity (Meat and Food Waste for Pigs) Regulations 2005, passed under the Biosecurity Act 1993, prohibits feeding pigs with uncooked meat or food that has been in contact with uncooked meat. In Auckland Ecostock SuppliesEcostock Supplies collects & recycles food waste from manufacturers, retailers, importers and transport companies to make high- quality stock feed. Supermarkets do not sell foods that are past their use by date or best before dates for legal reasons and perceived danger to health. Many supermarkets have partnered with food banks around the country and now donate tinned and packaged food which has passed its best before date, but it still safe to eat. There are 15 food rescue groups operating around the country as at 2019 such as KiwiHarvestKiwiHarvest in Auckland and Dunedin, KaiboshKaibosh in Wellington, KaivolutionKaivolution in Hamilton, to rescue fresh food and produce. This is then distributed to local food banks and social agencies. Most food banks do not report on how much dried or tinned food they have been donated, however 14 of the food rescue groups kept records of the tonnages of fresh food donated from supermarkets, manufacturers, growers and sometimes hotels and restaurants. In 2017 2,777 tonnes of food was rescued. In Wellington the Kai to Compost schemeKai to Compost scheme addresses commercial food waste in the city. It was initially a trial scheme with government funding but is now a user pays scheme involving 50 businesses. Dumpster diving, especially at supermarkets, does still occur to gather discarded food.  Hospitality food waste  Research conducted into hospitality food waste by the University of Otago and WasteMINZ in 2018 found that cafes and restaurants create 24,366 tonnes of food waste each year, of which 61% is avoidable. It is not known what percentage is sent to landfill as some businesses divert their food waste to composting facilities, food rescue collections or animals. For this research, food waste was divided into three categories: spoilage, preparation waste and plate waste. * Spoilage occurs with the over-purchasing of ingredients or poor stock rotation, which causes food to spoil and be discarded before it is even used. * Preparation waste occurs in the kitchen and includes things like vegetable peelings, eggshells or toast that gets burnt. It also includes any unsold food that is left at the end of the day. * Plate waste is whatever customers leave behind on their plate uneaten. Spoilage was found to be 7% of all food waste; preparation waste was 60% and plate waste was 33%. For caf√©s and restaurants, which offer prepared food such as scones, sandwiches, pies etc; 30% of the preparation waste was unsold food. By category, the food wasted the most in the sector is: # Vegetables 28% # Bakery 26% # KFC 18% # Meat 13% # Fruit 9% See also *List of waste types *Agriculture in New Zealand References Further reading * External links *New Zealand's Love Food Hate Waste Campaign *Biosecurity New Zealand - Feeding Food Waste to Pigs Category:Environmental issues in New Zealand Category:Waste in New Zealand Category:Food and drink in New Zealand Category:Food waste ","title":"Food waste in New Zealand"},{"id":"23999435","text":"Bulbophyllum mystax is a species of orchid in the genus Bulbophyllum.

The game is about an 18-year-old race car driver who must chase his dreams of drag racing after being turned down for university, after becoming a r≈çnin due to his joblessness status. The game received a sequel in the form of Zero4 Champ RR-Z. Gameplay A drag race is underway between two vehicles of a similar make. In between the racing, the player must maintain a part-time job in order to earn money for the next race. There are elements of the role playing and simulation game genres present as the player must build up his character through his job as a security guard and through social interactions with the racing community. While being a security guard, players can bump into random encounters into enemies such as wandering rats. Attacking, using an item, or running away from battle are the only options. Losing all of the player's experience points means getting fired from the security guard job. Vehicle models included in the game are Toyota, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Mazda, and Honda. Automatic transmission is not available in the game but players can choose between 4-speed, 5-speed, or 6-speed manual transmission for their chosen Japanese car. All measurements are done by using metric (i.e., kilometres per hour as opposed to miles per hour). Besides the story mode, the player can either challenge computer opponents or the best time on the battery backup to a drag racing showdown with all the rules of drag racing (including flying starts) Before the player can start his career, he must go to driving school and pass a test based on his proficiency with gear shifting and speed control. The versus mode that allows the single contestant to either play by himself or against a computer opponent also allows multiple human opponents. In order for the three different multiplayer modes to be selected, additional controller(s) must be inserted. The \\"four drag strip system\\" is used when three to four competitors are involved as opposed to the \\"two drag strip system.\\" All the important drag race rules apply even in three-player and four-player matches (with violating the rules more than twice leading to automatic disqualification and game over).

First published in 2009,Knopf, 261 pages, $25.95 released on 4 August 2009 the novel is much lighter in content than his previous work, the somber 2007 work Bridge of Sighs, which followed some upstate New York characters across several decades. Plot The story revolves around a past-middle-age former Hollywood screenwriter, Jack Griffin, who is presently teaching creative writing at a New England college. He loses both parents within a year of each other, and he travels considerable distance to attend two weddings during the same time. As he travels, and as he interacts both with his family and his in-laws, he ponders marital and family relationships. He is also mulling whether to remain in New England or return to the uncertainty of Hollywood. Reviews Kyle Smith, a film critic for the New York Post, quotes a scene from the book: :\\"At her retirement party, a college professor rises to tell her colleagues: 'I wish I could think of something nice to say about you people and this university. I really do. But the truth we dare not utter is that ours is a distinctly second-rate institution, as are the vast majority of our students, as are we.'\\" Mr. Smith says that scene \\"is, like so many in Richard Russo's writing, both cheerfully impertinent and stingingly true.\\"Leaving Mom and Dad; That Old Cape Magic, Bookshelf by Kyle Smith, Wall Street Journal, 14 August 2009, p. A11 Erin Adair-Hodges of Weekly Alibi writes: :\\"Russo isn't concerned with the psychological or stylistic fads of the moment. He is a clean writer who relishes the creation of characters who are flawed and smart enough to know it. Though That Old Cape Magic is a lighter entry than his previous books‚Äîboth in terms of length and scope (no shifting perspective or cast of dozens)‚Äîit is, like all of his work, honest.\\" References Category:2009 American novels Category:Alfred A.

Polak was from a Jewish, middle-class family in Philadelphia. He was the youngest son of Arthur Marcus Polak and Ann Polak. After withdrawing from Pennsylvania State University, Polak became the owner of Frankford Personnel and Northeast Advertising Service. He was an active and outspoken member of the gay community in Philadelphia, and was the second president of the Philadelphia- based homophile organization called the Janus Society.https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt3779r083/ In 1964, he created and edited Drum magazine, a low-budget early gay-interest periodical. On April 25, 1965 over 150 people were denied service at Dewey's, a local coffee shop and diner in Philadelphia. Those denied service were variously described at the time as ‚Äúhomosexuals,‚Äù ‚Äúmasculine women,‚Äù ‚Äúfeminine men,‚Äù and ‚Äúpersons wearing non-conformist clothing.‚Äù Three teenagers (reported by the Janus Society and Drum to be two males and one female) staged a sit-in that day. After restaurant managers contacted police, the three were arrested. In the process of offering legal support for the teens, Polak was also arrested. Demonstrations took place outside the establishment over the next five days with 1500 flyers being distributed by the Janus Society and its supporters. Three people staged a second sit-in on May 2, 1965. The police were again called, but refused to make arrests this time. The Janus Society said the protests were successful in preventing further arrests and the action was deemed ‚Äúthe first sit-in of its kind in the history of the United States‚Äù by Drum magazine. Polak argued for the importance of gay sexual liberation, which had been avoided in the struggle for gay rights. In 1969, after he was indicted by a federal grand jury on 18 counts of publishing and distributing obscene material, Polak ceased publication of Drum and moved to Los Angeles, where he became a real estate investor and art collector. He also wrote a series of articles in the Los Angeles Free Press between January 1974 and January 1975. In 1980, Polak committed suicide in Los Angeles. References External links * Clark P.

Ronald Huff, Arye Rattner, Edward Sagarin - Google Books, an American businessman, was convicted wrongly of rape. Titus was dismissed from his job after the conviction and, though the charges were soon dismissed, he became long term unemployed. The crime was later determined to have been committed by serial rapist Edward Lee King. Journalist Paul Henderson was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting for his work on the case. Jack Olsen's book Predator examined the investigation of the crime and the life of the real criminal.  Crime  A Chevrolet Chevette for illustrative purposes. On October 12, 1980, a female hitchhiker was raped in SeaTac, Washington. The assault took place south of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on land owned by the Port of Seattle. Port of Seattle Police described the rapist as 25 to 30 years old, driving a royal blue car with temporary license plates and cloth seats, and having a beard. The rape was reported to have occurred at 6:45 p.m. The victim walked to a nearby house, and after approximately 10 minutes of conversation, telephoned the police at 7:22 p.m. There were tire prints found near the scene which matched that of a Michelin XYZ tire, which was standard on 1981 Honda Accord LX cars, a model that was first sold in September, 1980. The victim reported that there was a large brown folder in the car and that the rapist wore a three piece suit. Steve Titus was arrested and was later identified by the victim in a line-up. Like the rapist, he had a beard. He had a new car, a royal blue Chevrolet Chevette. However, the car had neither Michelin tires nor cloth seats. The car had a large brown folder which Titus later claimed was planted in the car by the police. He did not have any suits.A Honda Accord for illustrative purposes. Psychologist Elizabeth Loftus argued at trial that the victim had elicited a false memory of the attacker due to a biased line up. When shown a line up of suspects the victim had initially claimed that Steve Titus was the man who looked the most similar to the attacker. Later in court the victim said that she definitely knew it was him. Her perceptions had been changed throughout the process of going to court through cues which created a false memory. At trial prosecution testimony was changed and evidence of innocence was explained away by prosecution experts and law enforcement officers. As a direct result, Titus was convicted wrongly of Rape in the First Degree, a crime that had a mandatory prison sentence. Working with investigative reporter Paul Henderson of the Seattle Times, Titus' new attorney, Jeff Jones, whom Titus had hired to pursue an appeal of his conviction, was able to convince the trial judge to grant a new trial based upon evidence developed by Henderson, arguing that Titus' trial attorney had been ambushed by surprise testimony which directly contradicted evidence contained in the Port of Seattle Police investigative reports. Subsequently, as a result of good police work by a local municipal police officer who had been reading the new articles about the case, a lead was developed as to a new suspect. That lead was followed up by the King County Sheriff's Office whose investigation resulted in the arrest of Edward Lee King, named by the pseudonym \\"Mac Smith\\" in Jack Olsen's book Predator: Rape, Madness, and Injustice in Seattle, who eventually confessed to the crime. Exculpatory evidence The timeline was an important factor in the case. Titus left his parents home at 6:10 p.m on October 12, 1980 after attending his father's birthday party where there were other guests. He was seen by a coffee shop waitress at 6:20 p.m. on the day of the rape. The waitress at different times thought she had seen him at 6:30 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. Titus made a long distance telephone call from his apartment at 7:00 p.m. on the day of the rape. The distance between the rape scene and Titus' apartment would have required a journey-time of 19¬Ω minutes according to a Seattle Times reporter. These times would not have allowed Titus to be at the location where the victim was raped at the time she indicated the crime had occurred. He was convicted on March 4, and the conviction was overturned June 8. He only spent one night in jail after conviction. After charges against him were dismissed, Titus sued the Port of Seattle and its Police Department, based upon evidence that their officers had changed and planted evidence, as well as convinced the victim to alter her testimony. Just before the trial, Titus died of heart failure. His parents settled and got $2 million to be paid over 20 years. The policeman accused of fabricating evidence died six years later of heart failure. Paul Henderson was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for investigative journalism for his reporting on this case and later became a private investigator specializing in freeing innocent people who have been convicted wrongfully. Jack Olsen wrote a book entitled Predator: Rape, Madness, and Injustice in Seattle detailing both the conviction of Titus and the life of Edward Lee King, a convicted rapist who later confessed to this rape, and who is thought to have committed more than 50 rapes.

World War II B-25J-10 43-27425, \\"111\\". 447th Bombardment Squadron, 321st Bombardment Group, Solenzara Airfield, Corsica in late 1944. During World War II the air base was constructed by the United States Army Air Force Twelfth Air Force XII Engineer Command as an all-weather temporary field built using Pierced Steel Planking for runways and parking areas, as well as for dispersal sites. In addition, tents were used for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with a drinkable water and minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting. As the airfield was not located on mainland France, no Advanced Landing Ground identifier was designated, and it was called Solenzara Airfield. The airfield was designed for fighter, medium bomber units, as well as for command and control. Known units assigned were: * HQ, 57th Bombardment Wing, 20 April-5 October 1944 * 310th Bombardment Group, 10 December 1943 ‚Äì 7 April 1945, B-25 Mitchell * 324th Fighter Group, 19 July 1944 ‚Äì 25 August 1944, P-40 Warhawk Both the 310th and 324th flew combat missions in support of the Invasion of Southern France (Operation Dragoon) during July and August 1944. At the end of the war, the American combat units moved out for their return to the United States. The airfield was then turned over to the French government in July 1945. * Maurer, Maurer.
