It is a three-story Greek Revival limestone structure built in the 1840s. It replaced an older timber frame courthouse near the current site, which served what was at that time the entire Holland Purchase, the vast tract that is today Western New York. At the time the courthouse was built, the county had been reduced to its current size by the creation of 10 other counties from the purchase. Construction materials were all sourced locally. Later it underwent some minor renovations. While Genesee County has subsequently built additional court facilities nearby where most judicial activity takes place, it is still used for some court purposes as well as offices for the county manager, attorney and the meeting place of the county legislature. In 1973 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Nine years later, in 1982, when the Genesee County Courthouse Historic District was added to the Register, the courthouse was again included as a contributing property. Building The courthouse is located in the west corner of the triangular lot with Main on the north, Ellicott on the south and Court Street to the east. It is prominently visible to traffic approaching down West Main Street from the west. The block contains one other building, a large Colonial Revival brick structure also used by the county. Walkways connect the two, and surrounding sidewalks, amid a large lawn. West of the courthouse, at the fork of Main and Ellicott, is the large granite Soldier's Monument, with a statue of General Emory Upton. See also: Other public buildings dominate the neighboring streets. The post office, old county jail and Batavia's old city hall, all also contributing properties to the historic district, are to the north, across Main. On the northwest is city police headquarters. Northeast is the new city hall and Genesee Country Mall. Other public buildings are on the south, with Tonawanda Creek behind them. All these buildings are surrounded by parking lots. Two blocks west along West Main is the Holland Land Office Museum, a National Historic Landmark. The commercial areas of downtown Batavia begin two blocks east along both streets. To the north, south and west are residential areas. The building itself is a five-by- five-bay structure with load-bearing limestone walls. On the east (front) side it is two and a half stories high, reaching a full three on the west. The lower level is set off by a belt course that also serves as a water table. Atop the building is a hipped roof with slate shingles trimmed in copper at the roofline. A cupola with bell from the original courthouse is in the center, and a brick chimney rises from the southeast corner. Across the first floor of the east facade are six large stone pilasters with Doric capitals. All the bays save for the centrally located main entrance have 12-over-12 double-hung sash windows. At the roofline is an architrave of three narrow bands topped by a plain wide frieze below the projecting cornice. The lower tier of the cupola has clapboard siding with corner pilasters and a frieze and projecting molded cornice of its own. Atop that is a balustrade surrounding the top tier, where each face has two Doric pilasters flanking a louvered vent. Above its frieze and cornice is a copper dome. Stone steps with center and side iron guardrails rise to the deeply recessed main entrance. The front door is framed by more Doric pilasters, sidelights and a transom above its own cornice. It opens into a central hallway with offices on either side. At the far end is a double stair that merges into one before it reaches the second floor. The main courtroom, with coved ceiling covered in acoustical tiles, is on that level along with two judges' chambers. Wainscoting and door and window trim are apparently original. The third floor has been converted from the county clerk's offices to an open meeting room for the county legislature. History Joseph Ellicott supervised the building of the first courthouse in 1802 on behalf of the Holland Land Company, for which he was agent. It was a two-story frame structure located to the east of the present building, near the site of the county building on the opposite side of the triangle. He had chosen what became Batavia for his headquarters due to its location at the convergence of major Iroquois trails through the region, two of which became Main and Ellicott streets and the state highways that follow them. The original building had jail facilities in the basement, offices on the first floor and its courtroom upstairs. Like its successor, it was topped with a cupola. Local lore holds that David McCracken, a prosperous early resident with a reputation for playing practical jokes, was surprised that the land company had not bought a bell to go with it, and commissioned a bell on his own from a foundry in New Haven, Connecticut. After taking delivery, he hung it from a pole between two trees and proceeded to ring it in the early hours of one morning, awakening the entire village. Ellicott asked if the bell was for sale, and when McCracken said yes, the land agent bought it from him at that very moment. It has hung in the courthouse ever since. As the Holland Purchase was settled more extensively, Genesee County, which had originally been coterminous with the lands, was subdivided into the other ten counties in the region. As the county's boundaries changed, this created pressure to relocate the county seat somewhere more central to the remaining county. This ended with the creation of the last county, Wyoming, to Genesee's immediate south, in 1841, leaving Batavia once again centrally located within the county. The county's Board of Supervisors had petitioned the state legislature for money to build a new courthouse, which was authorized that same year. Its Greek Revival design, typical for public buildings of the period, was an expanded version of the original courthouse, later to serve as town and village hall. The Onondaga limestone was quarried locally. The wall stones came from nearby Le Roy, already emerging as a center for that material, and the pillars and capitals from Lockport, the seat of Niagara County to the northwest. Local craftsmen worked on the construction. The building was finished early in 1843 and the first court sessions were held later that year. At first the Board of Supervisors allowed all sorts of public meetings to be held in the building, but by 1851 they had ordered the sheriff to allow only county meetings. The two building commissioners who had overseen construction later served as judges, one not leaving the bench until the early 20th century. The first renovations were made in 1862, when some aspects of the interior were altered and fireproofing was added to benefit the county clerk. In 1918 the original courthouse, since renamed Ellicott Hall, burned down. The bell was saved and moved to the cupola in the current courthouse. Major renovations took place in 1932. The front, originally a recessed full-width porch with freestanding columns, was enclosed to create more office space. The columns became pilasters. Inside, the upstairs courtroom was reconfigured into a north-south access and the bench was moved accordingly. These renovations cost $58,000 ($ in contemporary dollars). In 1957 the exterior walls were sandblasted. A more extensive 1975 project spent $155,000 ($ in contemporary dollars) to add a fire alarm and sprinkler system, lightning protection, gutter downspouts and cleaned the outside stone again. The windows and roofing were replaced, along with the wooden trim. The wooden supports for the bell were replaced, and its rope gave way to an electrical system. Air conditioning and an elevator were added in 1999. There have been no other substantial changes to the building. Currently it serves as offices for the county manager and his or her assistant, as well as the county attorney. The nine-member county legislature still meets twice a month in the upstairs courtroom.

The party was led by General Charles Lallemand. Land was offered to French settlers on March 3, 1817, after a vote by the United States Congress. Champ d'Asile was situated along the Trinity River and was abandoned in July of the same year. Lallemand, a Bonapartist General, was accompanied by his brother, Baron Charles Fran√ßois Antoine Lallemand. The colony was to bring some military men for protection, and concentrate on agricultural work, cultivating grapes and olives. 100 officers joined Lallemand, and around a quarter to a third of these were foreigners of the Grande Arm√©e; the rest were French. Lallemand financed the project through land speculation. On December 17, 1817 150 of the would-be-settlers sailed from Philadelphia for Galveston, Texas, where they arrived on January 14. Lallemand and the other colonists convened in New Orleans, and on March 10 left for Galveston with 120 volunteers. They sailed up the Trinity River to Atascosito where they built two small forts. Mexican governor Antonio Mar√≠a Mart√≠nez, having heard about this expedition, sent his own troops to San Marcos, wary of an attack. The colony was abandoned shortly afterwards. Some of the colonists, including pirate Jean Laffite and other mercenaries, had caused concern to settlers of New Spain. The Champ d'Asile was founded at a time when disputes over territory were increasing, and the Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty, which settled a border dispute between the United States and Spain, was signed in 1819. Furthermore, the Bourbon Restoration in France made the existence of a Bonapartist colony doubtful, as the Spanish Bourbons held the Spanish crown. Despite Lallemand's assurances, rumours had circulated about his motives, and there was little evidence of agricultural work on the site, while construction of a fortress and manufacturing munitions had begun.(5 August 1818).

UNAIDS estimate there to be 155,450 prostitutes in the country. Many women and young girls are forced into prostitution due to poverty, lack of job opportunities, culture, and the disintegration of the family unit. Many university students have to turn to prostitution for economic reasons. Sex trafficking and child prostitution are a major problems in Tanzania. The country is a destination for sex tourism, including female and child sex tourism, especially in the coastal resorts and Zanzibar. Sex tourism Tanzania is a popular destination for sex tourism, particularly in Arusha Bagamoyo and the islands of Zanzibar, Mafia and Pemba. Many of the tourists are Italian. Zanzibar is also a destination for female sex tourism. Many of the \\"beach boys\\" are not from Zanzibar. There are some agents offering holidays to the island, including an exclusive \\"guide\\". Most of the women are from Europe or North America. Child sex tourism is a problem, especially on the coastal resorts and the Kenyan border. Whilst some of the children are trafficked, some turn to prostitution through poverty. HIV Tanzania faces a mature, generalized HIV epidemic. In 2011, an estimated 1.6 million Tanzanians were living with HIV/AIDS. An estimated 1 out of 20 residents in the capital Dar es Salaam and 1 in 3 sex workers are infected with the HIV virus. Nationally, 28% of sex workers and 4.7% of all adults are infected. Reports show that an increase in the number of cases of HIV and AIDS are growing at an alarming rate in Zanzibar. This is thought to have been added to by large numbers of tourists entering Zanzibar and fueling demand for prostitutes. Sex trafficking Tanzania is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to sex trafficking. Internal trafficking is more prevalent than transnational trafficking and characteristically facilitated by victims‚Äô family members, friends, or intermediaries offering assistance with education or securing employment in urban areas. Impoverished children from the rural interior remain most vulnerable to trafficking. Girls are exploited in sex trafficking, particularly in tourist hubs and along the border with Kenya. Previous media reports indicate girls are subjected to sex trafficking in China. Tanzanian nationals are sometimes subjected sex trafficking in other African countries, the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and the United States. Trafficking victims from other countries, particularly children from Burundi, Rwanda, and Kenya, as well as adults from India, Nepal, and Yemen are subjected to sex trafficking. Citizens of neighbouring countries may transit Tanzania before being subjected to sex trafficking in South Africa, Europe, and the Middle East.

With the federal government represented as well as the city, it constitutes the civic core of Batavia, the city from whence the Holland Purchase, covering all of today's Western New York, was subdivided and settled in the early 19th century. In 1982 it was recognized as a historic district, one of two in the county, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Geography The district is an irregularly shaped five-acre () area on the north side of West Main and both sides of West Main, with its southern border at Ellicott. In the latter area, the triangular parcel between Main, Ellicott and Court Street, it includes the county courthouse and the county government building to its east. The Civil War memorial at the junction is also included. Across the street the buildings included, from west to east, are the original county jail, the post office, and city hall. To the south are other, modern government buildings and Tonawanda Creek. The Holland Land Office building, a National Historic Landmark now used as a historical museum, is on the south side of West Main two blocks to the west, with commercial buildings on the north giving way to houses in the adjacent blocks to the north and west. East of the district is the commercial core of Batavia. Contributing properties The district encompasses five government buildings and a monument. There are no non-contributing properties. *Batavia City Hall, 10 West Main Street. George Brisbane, son of original settler James Brisbane, built this two-story brick Italianate-style mansion in 1853. After some alterations in 1876, the city acquired it from his descendants in 1917 and adapted it for its current use as city hall, without adversely affecting the original architecture. *Genesee County Courthouse, Main and Ellicott Streets. Built between 1841 and 1843, it is the oldest building in the district, the focal point of traffic reaching the city center from the west. It uses local limestone for its load- bearing walls. Modeled on the timber frame courthouse built nearby by Joseph Ellicott in the early 19th century, the original Greek Revival style, made more prominent by the colonnade on the east (front) facade, has been softened by the expansion of the interior into the porch to create more office space. Still used as the offices of the county manager, county attorney and the meeting place of the county legislature, it was listed on the Register in 1973.See also: *Genesee County Building #1, Court Street. The most recent building in the district is located on the site of the original courthouse, which burned down in 1918. Eight years later, this two-and-a-half‚Äìstory 13-bay Classical Revival brick building and decorative elements including a balustrade, quoins and pilasters was built at a cost of $150,000 ($ in contemporary dollars) to take its place as county offices. A 1955 addition made it T-shaped. Renovations at the end of the 20th century made it disabled- accessible. *Genesee County Sheriff's Office and Jail, West Main Street. Poughkeepsie architect William J. Beardsley designed this two-story Victorian Gothic structure, completed in 1903. The turrets, brick and locally quarried Medina sandstone produce a small-scale fortress effect, similar to the nearby Attica Correctional Facility. It has remained in use by the sheriff's office since its construction, although other jail facilities have been built. *Soldier's Monument, Main and Ellicott streets. A bronze eagle perches on a globe at the top of a shaft on a 14-foot‚Äìsquare () granite base surmounted by a globe above which a bronze eagle is perched with wings extended seven feet. Facing west is a statue of General Emory Upton. It was erected in 1919 to honor the area's Civil War veterans. *U.S. Post Office, 2 West Main Street. This five-bay Classical Revival brick building on a sandstone foundation was built in 1919, credited to Treasury Department Supervising Architect James Wetmore. Its unusual parallelogram shape was required by the lot shape, in which the property lines run north-south instead of perpendicular to the street. It is one of only three post offices in New York that is a contributing property to a historic district while not itself being listed on the Register, for which it has been determined ineligible. History Batavia was founded in 1802 by Joseph Ellicott, surveyor and agent for the Holland Land Company, the group of Dutch investors who had bought the 3 million acres (1.2 million ha) west of the Genesee River from Continental Army financier Robert Morris. Ellicott chose what became Batavia, the name what is today The Netherlands had at the time, since it was at the fork of two major Iroquois trails, today the highways that follow the three streets, across the region. From the beginning of settlement the future district was used for governmental purposes, with a courthouse built at the fork to file the deeds once the owners had paid off the mortgage, previously kept at the land office down the street. Genesee County, which initially covered the entire Holland Purchase, was repeatedly subdivided into the 10 counties of the current region as it became settled and developed. With the 1840 creation of Wyoming County from the southern half of what had been the rump of Genesee County, Batavia resumed its central location within the county and erased any doubt as to its feasibility as the county seat. The current courthouse was built, a stone structure closely modeled on the original building. In its cupola is the original courthouse's bell, the only remnant of that building, which burned down in 1918 after a long period of use as village (later city) and town hall. The opening of the Erie Canal, which bypassed Batavia in favor of Orleans County, led to a decline from the city's earlier importance. But growth returned when the railroads were built and came through, following the old roads. William Brisbane's 1853 mansion was built at the height of this prosperity, before the Midwest displaced Western New York as the United States' major wheat-growing area. Now city hall, Brisbane's mansion is the only building in the district not originally built for government use. Early in the new century, the county built another new building in the future district to house its sheriff and prisoners. William J. Beardsley's late Victorian Gothic structure was opened in 1903. The years at the end of World War I saw a flurry of activity that did much to shape the district into the city's civic core. The city of Batavia bought Brisbane's mansion from his heirs and adapted it, with minimal significant change, into its city hall in 1917. The next year, the original courthouse that had stood since Ellicott's time was lost to fire. Across the street, the federal government established its presence in the area with a Classical Revival post office built on part of the original Brisbane property. The unusual shape of the parcel required that the building be shaped like a parallelogram. In 1919, with the war over, the city and county built the Soldiers' Monument at the corner to the west of the courthouse, to memorialize not just its veterans from the recent war but those from the Civil War a half-century before as well. The statue of Emory Upton honors the memory of the most famous local soldier, whose innovative tactics led to a Union victory at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House. It continues to honor and memorialize the veterans of later wars. The last government building to be added to the district was the county government building. With county government growing in scope, more space was needed. The site of the original courthouse had remained vacant, and in the mid-1920s the Rochester firm of Bohacket and Brew was hired to build the current building. Their ornate brick Classical Revival structure was opened in 1927. Five years later, the county enclosed the courthouse porch to create more office space, turning its columns into pilasters. Later renovations, in 1955, added a third wing to the county building. This is the most significant change to any of the buildings. The courthouse was modernized in the mid-1970s, and the county building made disabled-accessible in the late 20th century.

Pattison (1921‚Äì1943) was a United States Navy sailor killed in action during World War II who received a posthumous Navy Cross for his actions. Biography William Joseph Pattison was born at Long Island City in Queens, New York on 15 January 1921. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy on 23 August 1939 at Indianapolis, Indiana.The Dictionary of Naval Fighting Ships provides identical birth dates and locations and identical enlistment dates and locations for both William J. Pattison (at http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/w8/william_j_pattison.htm) and Merton B. Myers (at http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/m16/myers.htm), both of whom died at the same time in the Karin boarding attempt. This almost impossible coincidence in both date and place of birth, of enlistment, and of death in action suggests that the Dictionary of Naval Fighting Ships is in error concerning some or all of this information for one or both men. Other sources merely repeat the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships entries and are of no assistance in clearing up the matter. A conscientious sailor, Pattison advanced steadily in rating and, at least once, was meritoriously promoted. By the beginning of 1943, he had reached the rank of signalman third class and was serving in the destroyer USS Eberle (DD-430) in the South Atlantic Ocean. On 10 March 1943, Eberle encountered the German blockade runner Karin, which was flying the Dutch flag. The task group commander, Rear Admiral O. M. Read, ordered Eberle to ignore Karins Allied flag and board her. Pattison was one of the 14 men chosen from Eberles complement to board Karin before Karins crew could scuttle her and was the second American to reach Karins deck. In spite of rising flames and explosions, Pattison performed his salvage duties, primarily by maintaining contact with Eberle while his colleagues searched for demolition charges. While executing his duty, Pattison was killed by the explosion of one of the German demolition charges.

It provided against abuse of freedom of speech and expression, validation of zamindari abolition laws, and clarified that the right to equality does not bar the enactment of laws which provide \\"special consideration\\" for weaker sections of society. The formal title of the amendment is the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951. It was moved by the then Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, on 10 May 1951 and enacted by Parliament on 18 June 1951.Full text of First Amendment This Amendment set the precedent of amending the Constitution to overcome judicial judgements impeding fulfilment of the government's perceived responsibilities to particular policies and programmes. Freedom of speech In 1950, a leftist weekly journal in English, Cross Roads, published by Romesh Thapar was banned by the Madras State for publishing critical views on Nehruvian policy, who petitioned the Supreme Court, which led to the landmark judgment in \\"Romesh Thappar vs The State Of Madras\\" on 26 May 1950. Eventually, in 1951 Nehru administration made a provision limiting Article 19(1)(a) of Constitution of India against \\"abuse of freedom of speech and expression\\". Some courts had held the citizen's right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India to be so comprehensive as not to render a person culpable even if he advocates murder and other crimes of violence . The Parliament of India noted that in other countries with written constitutions, freedom of speech and of the press is not regarded as debarring the State from punishing or preventing abuse of this freedom. Freedom of trade The right of citizens of India to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business conferred by article 19(1)(g) is subject to reasonable restrictions which the laws of the State may impose \\"in the interests of general public\\". While the words cited are comprehensive enough to cover any scheme of nationalisation, it was thought desirable to place the matter beyond doubt by a clarificatory addition to article 19(6). Upholding land reforms The Parliament of India noted that validity of agrarian reform measures passed by the State Legislatures had, in spite of the provisions of clauses (4) and (6) of article 31, formed the subject-matter of dilatory litigation, as a result of which the implementation of these important measures, affecting large numbers of people, had been held up. Accordingly, a new article 31A was introduced with retrospective effect to uphold such measures. Further, another new article 31B was introduced to validate 13 enactments relating to zamindari abolition. Equality It is laid down in Article 46 as a Directive Principle of State Policy that the State should promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people and protect them from social injustice. In order that any special provision that the State may make for the educational, economic or social advancement of any backward class of citizens may not be challenged on the ground of being discriminatory, article 15(3) was suitably amplified. Background Jawaharlal Nehru encouraged the Parliament of India to pass the amendment in response to State of Madras v. Champakam Dorairajan, which went before the Madras High Court and then the Supreme Court of India. In that case, a Brahmin woman in Madras challenged the state's Communal General Order, which established caste quotas in government-supported medical and engineering schools, on the grounds that it denied her equality under the law; both courts had upheld her petition. Debates Aside from Nehru, B. R. Ambedkar also spoke in support of the proposed amendment, while Syama Prasad Mookerjee who opposed the amendment for curtailing freedom of speech expressly conceded that Parliament has the power to make the aforesaid amendment. Other amendments Certain amendments in respect of articles dealing with the convening and proroguing of the sessions of Parliament were also incorporated in the Act. So also a few minor amendments in respect of articles 341, 342, 372, and 376.

History  The town was the site of iron smelting from the ancient times; the name of the town originates from the Slavic word for 'ironworker', rednek. The first written mention in the form Lennek comes from a document by Emperor Sigismund dated 1390. The town belonged to the estate of Lockenhaus castle. It was destroyed by the Ottomans in 1529 and 1532, but it was subsequently rebuilt. In 1910, the town had a population of 310, most of whom were German speakers.

He is perhaps best known for his role as popular detective Mike Hammer in the 1953 version of I, the Jury, and for his guest appearance as Schmitter in the Star Trek episode \\"The Devil in the Dark\\". Early life Elliot was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, the son of Susan M. (n√©e Bernstein) and Israel Michael Shalek. All of his grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. His father was a former semi-pro baseball player who had, after retiring, opened a burlap-bag manufacturing business in Presque Isle, Maine. Elliot had a childhood nickname \\"Bith\\" but later adapted it to \\"Biff\\" when he went into boxing, which he did when he was 16 and his family had moved to Presque Isle. He then became known as Biff Harris. Eventually Elliot went on to become the North Maine champion and even reached the New England regional championship, but once his mother found out about his boxing, she refused to allow him to continue. In 1943, Elliot signed up for the United States Army, was placed in the 34th Infantry Division and later stationed to North Africa. Once the war finished, Elliot was discharged and decided to return to the University of Maine in 1945. In college Elliot wrote column for The Maine Campus entitled Scotch and Soda. He graduated in 1949 and moved to New York City in hopes of pursuing a writing career. After failing as a writer, Elliot switched his attention to acting, and began taking courses at the actors' studio. Career He first started doing stage and television work, mostly playing tough, working-class characters. When he was spotted by a Hollywood attorney while performing a television episode, the attorney recommended him to Victor Saville, the producer who was preparing the first film adaption of Mickey Spillane's I, the Jury. When accepted for the audition, Elliot was brought to Hollywood, and began preparing for his role by cramming with Mike Hammer novels, spending the whole night re-reading them. After a successful 15-minute audition, Elliot landed his first leading role on film and became the first actor to portray the famed Mike Hammer in a motion picture. Elliot was signed for a long term contract as Mike Hammer but the public didn't take to him and other actors were cast in the role.p. 191 Collins, Max Allen Mickey Spillane in His Own Words in Mickey Spillane on Screen: A Complete Study of the Television and Film Adaptations McFarland, 12 Jan 2018 Over the next few years, Elliot was a prominent fixture in classic war films of the 1950s and '60s, appearing in Between Heaven and Hell, The Enemy Below, Pork Chop Hill, and PT 109. But mostly he worked in television. In 1959, Elliot got a seemingly good break when playwright Clifford Odets happened to see I, the Jury and offered him a role in The Story on Page One, which Odets wrote and directed. Thereafter, over the next decade, Elliot was mostly seen on television, including an appearance on Frank Lovejoy's detective series, Meet McGraw, and an appearance on Perry Mason, starring Raymond Burr.In 1961 Elliot played the part of Buddy Blue,a trumpeter on the run from a gangster in the series 77 Sunset Strip.In 1966, he portrayed a government agent in an episode of the comedy series The Dick Van Dyke Show. In 1967, he appeared in the Star Trek episode \\"The Devil in the Dark\\". He guest- starred in an episode of Gibbsville in 1976. In 1977, he had a memorable supporting role in Telly Savalas's Beyond Reason with Diana Muldaur. A late notable role came in 1981 when he co-starred in Back to the Planet of the Apes, a TV movie. Elliot would make his final film appearance in 1986 in a comedy, co-starring with Jack Lemmon in a scene from That's Life!. His last appearance on television was in 1986 on the set of the television series of Starman, and he retired in 2001. Personal life After Elliot's retirement he worked in radio sports, covering Los Angeles sports for CBS Radio Network. Elliot was previously married to Betty Cole, a former model, whom he met during his tenure at the University of Maine and married in his sophomore year in 1948. She died in 1974. In 1977, he married Connie and they resided in Los Angeles. A brother of Win Elliott, longtime CBS Radio Network sportscaster and 1950's TV game show host, Biff Elliot died in his home in Studio City, California on August 15, 2012, aged 89.

It is meant to help students expand their vocabulary through analyzing the parts of English words. It is meant for classroom use, either through direct broadcast or through videotapes recorded from the airings by teachers or other school district personnel. The host is Bob Kupa'a Smith. In 2020, archived episodes were posted for public viewing on Indiana University's Libraries Moving Image Archive. Production Two series of Wordsmith were made. The first, in black and white, was filmed at KQED studios in San Francisco in 1964-1965, and was originally aimed at fifth grade elementary school students. Joanne Mock was the producer/director. It was distributed by the National Center for School and College Television (now called the Agency for Instructional Technology, or AIT). The show was largely improvised by host Bob Smith. Ten years later in 1975, the series was remade in color for AIT, then known as the Agency for Instructional Television. The executive producer was Gordon Hughan. The producer-directors were Glenn Johnson and Karen Hamamura Nelson. Its target audience ranged from middle school to high school students. It was recorded at the studios of KLCS, the station of the Los Angeles Unified School District. This second series is the one generally viewed today. Format Each 15-minute episode focuses on a related group of word cells, most of which derive from the ancient Greek and Latin languages. \\"Word Cell\\" is a term invented by series host Bob Smith as a more user- friendly alternative to terms like \\"prefix,\\" suffix\\" and \\"root word,\\" all three of which are included in the concept \\"Word Cell.\\" Bob wore the large- frame glasses and striking clothes of the era. Each program consists of a series of scenes, some taking place in the studio, and some filmed elsewhere. There are a variety of characters that act out or comment on the words featured in the episode. There are several recurring characters, portrayed not by actors but by framed portrait drawings, including Mr. Homonym, who knows what he means, but not which spelling to use, and Ms. Onomatopoeia, Ms. Hyperbole, and Mr. Alliteration. The word cells appear in the form of circular plastic-foam balls. When cracked open, they reveal the meaning inside. Once displayed, they get tossed down a clear plastic tube, to the accompaniment of a slide whistle sound, to reach an unknown end. There are \\"superwords,\\" extra long words that have to do with some of the word cells in the episode. Sometimes, children appear on the episode to tell people what their name means. This is called \\"What's in a Name.\\" There are also tests that go with the given vocabulary to reinforce memory. Episode content The episodes can be viewed in any order.

King George V), May 9, 1901, more commonly known in Australia as The Big Picture, is a 1903 painting by the Australian artist Tom Roberts. The painting, measuring , or roughly 10 by 17 feet, depicts the opening of the first Parliament of Australia at the Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne on 9 May 1901. The painting is part of the Royal Collection but has been on permanent loan to the Parliament of Australia since 1957. The work, currently on display in Parliament House, Canberra, has been described as \\"undoubtedly the principal work of art recording Australia's Parliamentary History.\\" Background On 1 January 1901, after years of debate, the various colonies in Australia joined in a federation. While the new Constitution of Australia called for a new capital to be constructed, away from the major cities, until that time Melbourne would act as the seat of government of the new nation. Elections were held for the first Parliament of Australia and on 9 May 1901, the new parliament was sworn in at the Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne. The opening of the new parliament was seen as a historic and momentous occasion with King Edward VII's son, the Duke of Cornwall and York (later George V) coming to Australia to officially open the new parliament on behalf of the King. To appropriately capture the occasion, the \\"Australian Art Association\\", a consortium of private benefactors, sought to commission a painting of the event as a \\"gift to the nation\\". Their motives were not entirely altruistic; the consortium hoped to profit by selling prints. Roberts was not the consortium's first choice, with J. C. Waite initially preferred. Composition Although not commissioned on the day of the opening, Roberts had received an approach from the consortium and so attended the ceremony to take photographs and sketches. Two weeks after the event, after the consortium were turned down by Waite, Roberts was formally commissioned to produce the painting. The contract initially was for 650 guineas but this was increased to 1000 guineas when the scope of the work was realised. Roberts was also paid one guinea for each subject's sketch plus expenses; in all he received over 2000 guineas for the work. The contract required Roberts to include at least 250 recognisable likenesses in the finished work, including the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York, the Governor General, each State Governor, Members of the new Commonwealth Parliament and other distinguished guests. Roberts started to work on the painting in a room provided at the Royal Exhibition Building. The painting was made in three flax panels to enable it to be folded for transportation. He travelled to Sydney and many other places to make sketches of the attendees as well as working from photographs. He asked his subjects for \\"measurements\\" to ensure accuracy‚Äîage, height, weight, hat size and even place of birth. In all, the picture included 269 separate portraits. Rumours spread that Roberts was paid by some of these dignitaries to ensure they were placed in a more prominent location. Most of the delegates at the ceremony wore black, still observing a period of mourning after the recent death of Queen Victoria. To balance this Roberts gave some emphasis to the choir, who were dressed in white. A shaft of light focused on the Duke reading the King's proclamation also provides some colour; this phenomenon was remarked upon by contemporary newspaper reports. Artistic licence was taken with the dais shown as much higher that it actually was and some other architectural features of the building either downplayed or ignored. Roberts also honoured the \\"Father of Federation\\", Henry Parkes, who had died five years previous. He added a portrait of Parkes in the form of a painting above the dais, this painting was not there on the day. Roberts took the painting to London‚Äîwhere many of the attendees lived‚Äîto complete, using the South African Room of the Imperial Institute as his workspace. The painting was finished on 16 November 1903; in all, it took Roberts two and a half years to complete. It was then taken to Paris where photogravure reproductions were made for sale to the public, with Roberts signing 500 of them. Roberts did not sign the actual painting. History The painting was first exhibited in the Royal Academy in London before being presented to King Edward VII by the Commonwealth Government in 1904. It was then moved to St. James's Palace where it remained on display until 1957. That year, Robert Menzies, the Prime Minister of Australia requested the permanent loan of the painting from Queen Elizabeth II. The Queen consented and the picture returned to Australia in 1958. The picture was to be exhibited in the King's Hall of the then Parliament House with the other historic records of events as the opening of the first Parliament in Canberra in 1927 and the Royal opening of Parliament in 1954, however it was too big for the available space. The decision was made to store the painting at the Australian War Memorial after a tour of the various state galleries. In 1969, the painting was moved to the Parliament House basement where it remained until 1980. As a result of its travels, the picture had deteriorated considerably and required major restoration work. The School of Materials Conservation at the Canberra College of Advanced Education started restoration work in 1980. The work included infra-red and ultra-violet photography to determine the condition of the painting followed by removal of old varnish and grime, repairs to the tacking margin and restoration of some small areas of paint. The work was completed in time for it to be taken to the new High Court of Australia building for its official opening by the Queen in 1981. The designers of the new Parliament House were mindful of the need to provide an appropriate space to display The Big Picture in the new building. The Joint Standing Committee responsible for the new building made the decision to place the painting in the Main Committee Room Foyer. The architects worked to ensure that major design elements in the room such as the skylight and balustrade around the work allowed for the integration of the painting with the available space. Because the fragile state of the picture prevented it from being rolled, moving the painting from the High Court to Parliament House was a major logistical exercise. The move required removal of some windows at the High Court, the construction of a special carrying frame and scaffolding and a system of winches to support the picture in place. The painting remains in this specially designed location to this day. On the occasion of the centenary of Federation in 2001, the Premier of Victoria Steve Bracks led a call for ownership of the painting to be formally transferred from the British Royal Collection to the Australian Crown. This was opposed as being both impracticable and unnecessary, as the Queen or her successors were unlikely to request its return. Legacy Roberts working on the painting at the Royal Exhibition Building The effort of creating such a monumental picture‚ÄîRoberts nicknamed it \\"The Big Picture\\"‚Äîtook its toll on the artist. Nicknamed \\"Bulldog\\", he drew a picture of a bulldog escaping a collar and chain in a letter he wrote informing that the picture was near completion. He described the painting once as his \\"Frankenstein of 17 feet.\\" Roberts's eyesight was weakened by the strain in representing so many likenesses accurately and the importance that he placed on the task sapped his strength. The biographer Humphrey McQueen claims the picture gave Roberts \\"an inflated idea of [his] own importance\\". However, Roberts never established himself as an artist in England and slipped into depression. The completion of the painting is generally seen as a turning point in his artistic career, after which his work never again reached the same heights. Roberts family reject this consensus as a \\"myth\\", with his great-granddaughter, artist Lisa Roberts, stating \\"His son, my grandfather, Caleb, documented that for a year he was depressed which isn't surprising after a huge commission like that that took him away from the thing he loved most which was the landscape. But after that, he went back to it. He continued to paint but not with the desire to be rich and famous.\\" The work itself was considered a worthy record of the event but not a masterpiece. It has, however, become the best known pictorial record of the historic occasion, and a national icon. The cartoonist Bill Leak's homage, The big picture.... with apologies to Tom Roberts, won the 1997 Walkley Award for best artwork. Robert Hannaford was commissioned to create a companion piece to celebrate the centenary of Federation in 2001.

A spiritual crisis may cause significant disruption in psychological, social, and occupational functioning. Among the spiritual experiences thought to lead to episodes of spiritual crisis or spiritual emergency are psychiatric complications related to existential crisis, mystical experience, near-death experiences, Kundalini syndrome, paranormal experiences, religious ecstasy, or other spiritual practices. Background Before the mid-1970s, mainstream psychiatry made no distinction between spiritual or mystical experiences and mental illness (GAP, 1976, p. 806). However, during the 1960s and 1970s, the overlap of spiritual/mystical experiences and mental health problems became of particular interest to counterculture critics of mainstream psychiatric practice who argued that experiences that fall outside of the norm may simply be another way of constructing reality and not necessarily a sign of mental disorder. The assumption of mainstream medical psychiatry was also challenged by critics from within the field of medical psychiatry itself. For example, R. D. Laing argued that mental health problems could also be a transcendental experience with healing and spiritual aspects. Arthur J. Deikman further suggested use of the term \\"mystical psychosis\\" to characterize first-person accounts of psychotic experiences that are conceptually similar to reports of mystical experiences. Because of the gaining recognition of the overlap of spiritual/mystical experiences and mental health problems, in the early 1990s authors Lukoff, Lu, & Turner (Turner et al., 1995, p. 435) made a proposal for a new diagnostic category entitled \\"Religious or Spiritual Problems\\". The category was approved by the DSM-IV Task Force in 1993 (Turner et al., 1995, p. 436) and is included in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). The inclusion marks increasing professional acceptance of spiritual issues in the assessment of mental health problems. Study The concept of \\"spiritual crisis\\" has mainly sprung from the work of transpersonal psychologists and psychiatrists whose view of the psyche stretches beyond that of Western psychology. Transpersonalists tend to focus less on psychopathology and more unidirectionally toward enlightenment and ideal mental health (Walsh & Vaughan, 1993). However, this emphasis on spirituality's potentials and health benefits has been criticized. According to James (1902), a spiritual orientation focusing only on positive themes is arguably incomplete, as it fails to address evil and suffering (Pargament et al., 2004). Scholarly attention to spiritual struggle is therefore timely as it can provide greater balance to the empirical literature and increase understanding of everyday spirituality. Another reason for the study of spiritual crisis is that growth often occurs through suffering (e.g., Tedeschi, Park, & Calhoun, 1998). As such, neglecting problems of suffering might result in neglecting vital sources of spiritual transformation and development (Paloutzian, 2005). Both the terms \\"spiritual crisis\\" and \\"spiritual emergency\\" (Grof, 1989) share in the common recognition that: # non-ordinary experiences and psychological disturbances (e.g., anxiety and panic) often overlap; # Western medicine may have different, and therefore potentially conflicting, values among their patients about these experiences; # people need specialized support in their local area when in crisis. Neurological causes Spiritual crises, and spontaneous spiritual experiences, may have neurological causes, such as described in the Geschwind syndrome and in neurotheology. The Geschwind syndrome is a group of behavioral phenomena evident in some people with temporal lobe epilepsy. It is named for one of the first individuals to categorize the symptoms, Norman Geschwind, who published prolifically on the topic from 1973 to 1984. There is controversy surrounding whether it is a true neuropsychiatric disorder. Temporal lobe epilepsy causes chronic, mild, interictal (i.e. between seizures) changes in personality, which slowly intensify over time. Geschwind syndrome includes five primary changes; hypergraphia, hyperreligiosity, atypical (usually reduced) sexuality, circumstantiality, and intensified mental life. Not all symptoms must be present for a diagnosis.

The guard station was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps to house the seasonal assistant ranger responsible for patrolling the forest around Paulina Lake. Because of its rustic architecture, the guard station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.  History  In the 1920s and 1930s, Forest Service employees often traveled many miles from local ranger stations to forest work sites. Since the forest road networks were not well developed, getting to a job site meant a long trek, carrying all the equipment need to perform the field work. This made it impractical for employees to make daily round-trips. To facilitate work at remote sites, the Forest Service built guard stations at strategic locations throughout the forest to house fire patrols and project crews. After World War II, the Forest Service greatly expanded its road network, allowing employees to get to most National Forest areas within a few hours. As a result, many guard stations were no longer needed. The Forest Service found new uses for some stations, but most were demolished or abandon.\\"A Bit of History\\", Recreation Rentals of the Pacific Northwest, Pacific Northwest Region, United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Portland, Oregon, 26 March 2009.

The team plays at Helsinki Ice Hall. History The club was founded in 1897 and started participating in ice hockey in 1929. Since then, HIFK has won the Finnish national championship seven times (1969, 1970, 1974, 1980, 1983, 1998, and 2011). HIFK has the highest number of audience in the Liiga and is one of the wealthiest sports clubs in Finland. The derbies against local rivals Jokerit were often sold out and were among the fiercest in Nordic ice hockey, but are no longer played following Jokerit's withdrawal from Liiga after the 2013‚Äì14 season to join the Russian-based Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). Following a history of even series of games, HIFK won the game total with 106‚Äì105 after a 2‚Äì1 victory in a classical outdoor game in March 2014, claiming the title of Helsinki's dominion. HIFK's general manager starting from May 1, 2008, is Jukka Valtanen. He is the successor of Pentti Matikainen, who coached Team Finland to its first hockey Olympic medal (silver) in Calgary 1988. HIFK won the Finnish national championship in the 2010‚Äì11 season when they defeated Espoo Blues. The championship team from 1998 is widely recognized as one of the best ever to have skated together in the top flight of Finnish ice hockey. Players on the 1998 championship team included a number of future (and former) NHL players ‚Äì including Tim Thomas, Jan ƒåaloun, Johan Davidsson, Bob Halkidis, Olli Jokinen, Jere Karalahti, Jarno Kultanen, Brian Rafalski, Christian Ruuttu, Jarkko Ruutu, Kimmo Timonen and Marko Tuomainen. History One of the major influences to HIFK was the NHL veteran and Stanley Cup winner Carl Brewer. Hired in 1968 as a playing coach, he advocated a North American style of play which has persisted in HIFK since. Brewer's influence on the way ice hockey is played in Finland led to his posthumous induction to the Finnish Hockey Hall of Fame in 2003.

Since the Kentucky Oaks is run on the Friday preceding the Kentucky Derby, the trophy presentation occurs on Friday evening, the evening before the Derby (which is held on the first Saturday in May). The trophy presentation is ceremonial only, since the trophy remains in the custody of the Kentucky Derby Museum in Louisville, Kentucky. The presentation is usually carried in prime-time television. History of the trophy The Kentucky Oaks was first run in 1875; its winner gained a purse of $1,175, but the existing records do not mention any trophy as part of the award ceremony.web.archive.org/web/20071205195626/http://www.kentuckyderby.com/2002/kentucky_oaks/oaks_history/ Kentucky Derby/Kentucky Oaks website, accessed 18 September 2009 In 1924 Lemon & Son, Inc. commissioned Redlich & Co. of New York City to create a loving cup, possession of which would signify having won the Kentucky Oaks competition. Redlich asked George Louis Graff to provide an appropriate design. The resulting sterling silver design was 25 inches (64 cm) tall, with horse-head handles on each side and an ornate silver horseshoe on top. Each year the winner's name is engraved on the trophy. In 1955, Churchill Downs had all winners prior to the 1924 race also engraved on the trophy. The first winner engraved on the trophy was Princess Doreen in 1924. Her owner Harry Stutts, trainer S. Miller Henderson and breeder from the Audley Farm Stable were there for the first ceremonial presentation. Status of the trophy The Kentucky Oaks trophy is held at and by the Kentucky Derby Museum in Louisville. As a permanent memento, the winning owner of the Oaks receives a set of 12 sterling silver julep cups in a satin-lined wood case. The julep cups are also engraved with the year and the names of the winning team. It is a sentimental tradition that the winning owner gifts a julep cup each to the winning trainer, winning jockey and the breeder of the horse, although there is no requirement to make the gifts.The Kentucky Derby Media Guide, 135th Kentucky Derby, Churchill Downs, 2 May 2009, p. 240. The winner of the Kentucky Oaks is also presented with a Garland of Lilies draped around the filly's withers. Garland of \\"Lillies for the Fillies\\" presented to Rachel Alexandra The first garland for the Kentucky Oaks was presented to Kathleen, the 1916 winner. It was made of roses, not the lilies that have become synonymous with the filly's race today. Though every Oaks winner since Kathleen has received a garland, the Star Gazer Lily did not become the official flower of the Kentucky Oaks until 1991, when the Kroger Company was commissioned to create a feminine garland for the fillies. Lite Light, winner of the 117th Kentucky Oaks, was the first filly to receive the garland of lilies. The Star Gazer Lily was selected for its femininity and strength. A total of 133 lilies are sewn onto a white moire fabric backing with a fleur- de-lis pattern, which, like the green satin of the Derby garland, is embroidered in white-on-white with the seal of the Commonwealth of Kentucky at one end and an image of the Twin Spires and the words stating which running of the Kentucky Oaks it is on the opposite end. It is trimmed in a border of Oak Ivy Leaves symbolic of the event. The completed fabric is 116 inches long, 18 inches wide and weighs approximately 18 pounds. A bouquet of Star Gazer Lillies is also given to the jockey for the winner's circle photo. Kroger is the official florist of the Kentucky Oaks and Derby. The public can view the lily garland at a local Kroger store the evening before the race.The Kentucky Derby Media Guide, 135th Kentucky Derby, Churchill Downs, 2 May 2009, p. 241.

As a doctor he operated a thriving practice in San Diego, served briefly as president of the City Board of Health and as a surgeon for the San Diego and Arizona Railway, and established a hospital and clinic in the city's downtown district. He is best known, however, for founding the Zoological Society, which grew out of his involvement with the Panama‚ÄìCalifornia Exposition in 1916, and for being the driving force behind the creation and early growth of the Zoo. As president of the Zoological Society from its inception in 1916 until his death in 1941, Wegeforth planned much of the Zoo's layout and many of its early exhibits. He convinced several wealthy San Diegans to contribute to the Zoo's construction and development, and campaigned for ballot measures to secure its lands and finances. He networked and traded animals with many other zoos across the country, creating the National Association of Zoological Executives which later evolved into the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. After a heart attack in 1931 forced him to abandon his medical practice, he spent his remaining years traveling the world, collecting and trading animals for the Zoo. An amphitheatre at the Zoo and an elementary school and day care facility in San Diego's Serra Mesa community are named in his honor.  Early life  Harry Wegefarth was born in Baltimore, one of seven children born to Conrad Wegefarth‚Äîa German immigrant and oil prospector for whom Wegefarth County, Texas was named‚Äîand his third wife, Mary Elizabeth MacArthur, who was of Scotch-Irish descent.Wegeforth and Morgan, p. 19. Harry had twelve siblings: Brothers Arthur, George, Paul, and Charles; sisters Emma and Ellen; and six older half-brothers from his father's previous marriages.Wegeforth and Morgan, p. 19‚Äì20. Harry showed an interest in animals from childhood, reading books on their habits and characteristics, playing at circus using toy ones, searching for crabs in Chesapeake Bay, and hunting for snakes in nearby woods and then selling them to neighbors. He became interested in tightrope walking after observing circus performers, and at age twelve began practicing with them at their winter quarters nearby.Wegeforth and Morgan, p. 20. After his second winter of practice he went out on tour with them as part of their act, but was brought home by his elder brother Charles. Charles drowned while Harry was still a boy, instilling in him an aversion to swimming; Harry never swam, and urged family members against it.Wegeforth and Morgan, p. 32.  Education  Following his older brothers into the study of medicine, Wegefarth earned a position with the Baltimore Health Department at age fifteen.Wegeforth and Morgan, p. 21. After contracting influenza during a snowstorm, he diagnosed himself with acute tuberculosis and, on the advice of one of his brothers, moved to Colorado for his respiratory health at age sixteen. There he worked as a cowboy for almost four years, herding Texas Longhorns while completing his high school education via correspondence course.Wegeforth and Morgan, pp. 21‚Äì22. Having recovered from his tuberculosis, he returned to Baltimore and enrolled at Baltimore Medical College, supporting himself by working in drug stores and teaching anatomy during the winters, and working on a sister-in-law's farm in the summers.Wegeforth and Morgan, p. 22. He earned his Doctor of Medicine degree in May 1906, and took postgraduate training at Johns Hopkins University, specializing in surgery. He took a position as assistant bacteriologist for the city of Baltimore, and then became first surgeon of the Baltimore Northeastern Dispensary.  Career   1908‚Äì15: Establishing a medical practice  Wegforth's medical offices were in the Granger Building (pictured in 2014), owned by millionaire Ralph Granger. Wegeforth married Granger's daughter Rachel in 1913, and sheltered animals in the building's basement in the early days of the San Diego Zoo. Wegefarth left Baltimore in 1908, heading west in search of a place in which to open his own medical practice. He stopped off in Jamestown, North Dakota, but found the weather too cold and continued on to Seattle, then south, arriving in San Diego. Passing the California State Board of Medicine examinations, he borrowed $50 and opened offices in downtown San Diego in the Granger Building at the southwest corner of D Street (now Broadway) and Fifth Avenue in 1910. Ralph Granger, the building's owner, had become a millionaire by staking two German miners who discovered the \\"Last Chance\\" silver mine near Creede, Colorado in 1890; moving to San Diego in 1892, he bought and became vice president of the Merchants National Bank and built the Granger Building, with the bank occupying the ground floor. Wegefarth married Granger's daughter Rachel on November 14, 1913; he was 31 years old, she 20. Around this time Harry changed the spelling of his family name to Wegeforth. During his first few months in San Diego, Wegeforth was often called upon by Sheriff Fred M. Jennings to treat prisoners at the county jail (Jennings' daughter, Belle Benchley, would later work under Wegeforth as Executive Secretary of the San Diego Zoo). He became interested in orthopedic surgery, and studied specialized techniques at medical centers in Baltimore and New York.Wegeforth and Morgan, p. 41. Wegeforth's sister Emma soon moved to San Diego and became his housekeeper and medical secretary. In 1912 he was appointed president of the City Board of Health and launched drives to improve the quality of the city's food by advocating for purification of milk and foodstuffs, bacteria tests for food suppliers, and publication of names of suppliers who did not meet these standards.Wegeforth and Morgan, p. 42. Feeling that mayor James E. Wadham and the San Diego City Council did not back these attempted reforms, he criticized them in newspapers and was promptly fired. His efforts were lauded in a San Diego Sun editorial, which said \\"He has worked hard and long and courageously against that old- fossilized regime which has done little or nothing to stop unclean meat, poor milk, and carelessly kept foodstuffs, along with a suspicion of petty graft among the subordinates of the city service ... If what Dr. Wegeforth has been doing is 'incompetence', as charged, then what the city seems to need is some more of the same kind of incompetence.\\" As his medical practice expanded, Wegeforth became known as a diagnostician. In 1915 his brothers Paul and Arthur also moved to San Diego; Paul, a brain surgeon, joined Harry's practice, while Arthur served as head of the San Diego Hospital-Clinic until his death in 1939.  1916‚Äì22: Founding the Zoological Society of San Diego and San Diego Zoo  In 1916 Harry and Paul Wegeforth served as surgeons for the second year of the Panama‚ÄìCalifornia Exposition held in Balboa Park.Wegeforth and Morgan, p. 23. Harry also served on the Exposition's board of directors, and had the idea to start a zoo using exotic animal exhibits that would be left over following the Exhibition's closure. By his own account, his inspiration came on September 16, 1916, as he and Paul were driving down Sixth Avenue on their way back to their office after performing an operation at the St. Joseph Hospital.Wegeforth and Morgan, p. 71. Hearing the roaring of lions from one of the Exposition's exhibits, Harry remarked to his brother \\"Wouldn't it be splendid if San Diego had a zoo! You know ... I think I'll start one.\\" Paul offered to help, but did not think the project would gain much support since the Exposition was not as successful as it had been the prior year. In an article in the San Diego Union, the brothers announced a call for interested parties to join them in forming a zoological society to develop and support a zoological garden. Joined by naturalist Frank Stephens and doctors Fred Baker and Joseph Cheesman Thompson, they held the first organizational meeting of the Zoological Society of San Diego on October 2, 1916 in the Wegeforths' offices; Harry served as the founding president, Paul as secretary. The Articles of Incorporation and by-laws for the Society were executed on December 11, 1916.Wegeforth and Morgan, p. 72. The San Diego Zoo began as a long row of cages along Park Boulevard, described by Wegeforth as \\"little more than Menagerie Row\\", featuring lions, bears, ducks, lynxes, golden eagles, rails, a badger, a gray fox, a coyote, a whip snake, a white goose, and groups of buffalo, deer, and elk.Wegeforth and Morgan, p. 73. Most of these animals had been rented for the Exhibition from a menagerie at the Wonderland Amusement Park in nearby Ocean Beach, which had since gone out of business; others were scattered in various exhibits throughout Balboa Park and turned over to the fledgling Zoo by the Park Department, while some were donated to the Society or acquired through trade.Wegeforth and Morgan, pp. 75‚Äì76. To feed the collection, Wegeforth himself went along the San Diego waterfront asking fishermen to donate fish, traveled to outlying ranches to convince farmers to donate hay, and collected second-grade fruits and vegetables from produce markets.Wegeforth and Morgan, p. 24. Upon American entry into World War I in mid-1917, Paul Wegeforth resigned from the Zoological Society's Board of Directors to accept a commission in the United States Army. Harry also volunteered for military service but was rejected for medical reasons, having had an appendectomy in October 1916.Wegeforth and Morgan, p. 27.Wegeforth and Morgan, p. 78. The Society faced financial challenges in maintaining its growing animal collection and had run out of funds by October 1917, so Wegeforth organized a track and field meet between the Navy and Marine Corps, generating enough revenue from ticket sales to maintain the Society through the end of the year.Wegeforth and Morgan, pp. 84‚Äì86. Negotiating with the Balboa Park Commission for a permanent location for the Zoo, in 1918 he agreed to an arrangement in which the City of San Diego would legally own all of the Zoo's animals, equipment, and property, but the Zoological Society would have exclusive jurisdiction over and management of them.Wegeforth and Morgan, p. 80. Reapplying to the Army Medical Corps, Wegeforth was commissioned as a captain in July 1918 and assigned to the Neuro-Surgical Institute of New York for training.Wegeforth and Morgan, p. 86. He resigned from the Zoological Society's Board of Directors and was replaced as president by Joseph Sefton, Jr. However, the Armistice of 11 November 1918 was signed before he was transported overseas, and in January 1919 he returned to San Diego to resume his medical practice and his position as president of the Society. Upon his return he began constructing reptile cages and started trading with and selling animals to other zoos, exchanging two brown bear cubs for a polar bear. Wegeforth initially asked the city council for almost ten percent of Balboa Park's 1,200-acres (490 ha) for the Zoo, but was rebuffed by parties who believed the acreage should be left as open parkland. He studied the layouts and architecture of many other zoos, and rode his Arabian stallion through the hills and canyons of the Zoo's new property planning its design and exhibits. Much of the planning was done in his medical offices, where he met with contractors, suppliers, and designers and went over blueprints and construction schedules. Many local philanthropists responded to Wegeforth's urging and provided funding. He made collecting trips to other zoos and to many other countries, collecting animals personally rather than through dealers, often trading local species (such as rattlesnakes and sea lions) for exotic species (such as elephants and koalas).Encyclopedia of the World's Zoos, Volume 3, by Catherine E. Ball, page 1130  1923‚Äì30: Continued zoo work and founding of hospital-clinic  As the Zoo grew, so did the demands of Wegeforth's medical practice.Wegeforth and Morgan, pp. 28‚Äì29. He spent many weekends and vacations at the Zoo, and would also spend his lunch breaks there, dictating letters and conferring with the small staff. His hands-on management of the zoo, combined with early financial problems, caused a frequent turnover in zoo directors. The most prominent was Frank Buck, who went to work as temporary director for the San Diego Zoo on June 13, 1923, signed to a three-year contract by Wegeforth. Dr. William T. Hornaday, director of the Bronx Zoo, had recommended Buck for the job. But Buck quickly clashed with the strong-willed Wegeforth and left the zoo after three months to return to animal collecting.San Diego Historical Society History News, Vol. 23, No. 5, May 1987, p. 3. Past Comes Alive, Fascinating facts from the Archives, Frank Buck in San Diego. In 1927, after several other equally short- lived zoo directors, Wegeforth appointed the zoo's bookkeeper, Belle Benchley, to the top position in the zoo, that of executive secretary. He soon realized that she was functioning as the zoo's director so he gave her that title. For the next 15 years the two of them worked together to transform the zoo from a small collection of animals to an innovative, world-class zoo. He and Neil Morgan co-wrote a history of the San Diego Zoo called It Began With a ROAR!Wegeforth, Harry M, and Neil Morgan, ‚Äò‚ÄôIt began with a ROAR! The beginning of the world-famous San Diego Zoo,‚Äô‚Äô San Diego Zoological Society, San Diego, 1953 Wegeforth continued to serve as president and chief promoter of the zoo until his death in 1941 at the age of 59. Other civic activities In 1926 he was a key mover in the decision to purchase and bring to San Diego the sailing ship Star of India, now a museum ship in San Diego Bay.Jerry McMullen: An Uncommon Man, Journal of San Diego History, Vol. 28, no. 1, Winter 1982  Personal life  Gal√°pagos tortoise at the San Diego Zoo in 2013. Wegeforth had a fondness for turtles and tortoises, and traded for them frequently to build up a large collection for the San Diego Zoo. Wegeforth married Rachel Granger, daughter of millionaire Ralph Granger, in 1913. Their wedding, which was attended by actresses Norma, Natalie, and Constance Talmadge, took place at a new house in the city's Burlingame neighborhood, where the couple lived for a year. The house, designed for them by architect William Henry Wheeler in the American Foursquare style, is now designated as a Historical Landmark by the City of San Diego. They later lived in a larger home in the Marston Hills neighborhood.Wegeforth and Morgan, pp. 67‚Äì68. They had two sons, Lester and Milton. Wegeforth enjoyed cars; he bought a new Overland Automobile around the time of his marriage, and in 1923 went into debt to buy an eight-cylinder, fully equipped Packard which he paid to have repainted fire engine red, then traded in within a year.Wegeforth and Morgan, p. 31. A fan of music, he often researched details on the latest phonographs and record changers. His hobbies included building radios, shooting, and photography; he created a large collection of color slides documenting the Zoo and his worldwide travels.Wegeforth and Morgan, p. 32. He was a 32nd-degree Mason, and joined many San Diego social and country clubs. For sport he enjoyed football and baseball and was an active horseback rider. His favorite author was Rudyard Kipling, and his favorite novel was Kim.Wegeforth and Morgan, p. 29. Of the many animals he helped acquire for the Zoo, he had a particular passion for turtles and tortoises. He traded for them at many zoos during his travels in order to build up a large collection at the San Diego Zoo, and decorated his office with many likenesses of them. On one occasion he complained to a visiting New York zoo official that the man had not sent him any turtles; after spending a few minutes in the Zoo, the visitor returned to Wegeforth exclaiming that the Zoo had some 48 turtle basins, and probably the largest collection of turtles in the world.  Legacy  Notoriously self-effacing, Wegeforth took little credit for his role in creating the San Diego Zoo. He requested that journalists use the name of the Zoological Society rather than his own in articles about the Zoo \\"so that it would become a society's function instead of an individual's\\", and preferred to give credit to the persons who worked on projects or who donated their labor or funds.Wegeforth and Morgan, p. 60. In 1936 the Zoo's amphitheatre was named the Wegeforth Bowl in his honor; at the unveiling of a commemorative plaque dedicated to him, Wegeforth expressed gratitude but told the assembled officials that the money for the plaque would have been better spent to buy an animal.Wegeforth and Morgan, p. 30. Harry M. Wegeforth Elementary School opened in San Diego in 1957. The site was dedicated on February 9, 1959 with Mrs. Harry Wegeforth and family in attendance.

Currently, he is the founder and CEO of TV360, a company specializing in the distribution of news programming and digital films, and he is also the creator of TeamDML.com, an online membership-based service for people who wish to listen to his daily podcast about politics and news. Recently, Lynch became the co-owner of a CBD brand that bears his name, DML CBD. Early life Lynch was raised in a blue collar suburb of Long Island called Hicksville. After graduating high school, he went on to attend the John Jay College of Criminal Justice at the City University of New York for a single semester. According to Lynch, he left college to become an entrepreneur. Career Business After dropping out of college, Lynch launched a computer recycling company called Lynx Technologies. In August 1999 Lynch secured $13 million from venture capitalists and John Sculley, the former CEO of Apple and Pepsi. In less than a year, Lynch expanded the company to 300 employees and five locations across the country, and renamed it TechSmart. As a result, in 2000 he was selected as the winner of Long Island's Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award. On September 11, 2001, Lynch was in Manhattan, New York when terrorists flew two planes into the World Trade Center. In an interview with Megyn Kelly of Fox News, Lynch said he is one of the people seen running in the streets as the first tower collapsed. Shortly after 9/11, Lynch enrolled at the New York Film Academy. Having completed a 5-week course in digital filmmaking, Lynch launched TV360, a video production company that specializes in the distribution of both long and short form videos and films centered on the issues facing the Unites States such as immigration and homelessness. In early 2019, Lynch launched the news aggregation website DMLNewsApp.com. The website mainly features articles and videos from major news outlets throughout the U.S., and from around the world. Films In 2010 Lynch produced his first full-length documentary, King of the Hamptons. The film is about the serious impacts of a midlife crisis. The film features Billy Joel, Christie Brinkley, Alec Baldwin, and Ed Burns. It premiered at the Hamptons International Film Festival 2010. In 2012, Lynch released a film about illegal immigration in the United States, They Come to America, written and directed by Lynch. In 2012, Lynch begin filming They Come to America II'. On July 4, 2013, Lynch appeared on a special episode of Hannity titled \\"The Cost of Amnesty\\" in which he, Sean Hannity, and other guests, discussed Lynch's latest movie They Come to America II: The Cost of Amnesty as well as the recent passage of the Senate immigration bill S744, terrorism, and unemployment. In 2014, Lynch released his third film, titled We Ride to D.C. The film is about how the public has lost faith in the news media. As with all his films, Lynch released the documentary on DVD stating it was the best means of distribution when measuring the costs of running in theaters. The following year, Lynch released 'They Come to America III.' The film focuses on the hardships of the Texas Border Patrol, and how they struggle to secure the border when Washington DC uses the topic of immigration as a political football. Lynch also made a short film called, 'A Day At Bundy's.' The documentary focuses on the events that took place in 2014 when the Nevada-based Bundy family battled the federal government over land rights and grazing fees. Lynch, who was on assignment for Megyn Kelly and Fox News, stepped between federal agents and hundreds of Bundy supporters to help reach a peaceful resolution. Years later, Lynch was a key witness in the Bundy trial launched by the federal government. Lynch testified that he was a neutral observer who saw an opportunity to stop a massive shootout between citizens and the government. Megyn Kelly claimed on her Fox News program 'The Kelly File' that Lynch saved lives with his heroic actions. In 2018, Lynch announced he was touring the United States in a 40-foot motorhome for one month starting May 14. In his announcement, Lynch said he was taking a break from the news business because he has grown tired of all the negativity. He also announced that his tour will include the making of two films. The first film, 'America the Beautiful,' focuses on the beauty of the United States, its history and diverse people. However, Lynch announced he would change the project into an episode driven series instead of a film. The series is available exclusively to members of TeamDML.com The second film focuses on the homeless epidemic in the U.S. The film, which was released on DVD and Amazon Prime in late 2019, is called UNITED STATES OF TENTS. Lynch and crew highlight the importance of finding a solution to the growing problem. In fall 2019, Lynch launched They Come to America IV. The film focuses on the Trump administration's handling of border security. The film is available on DVD through Lynch's website DennisMichaelLynch.com, and will be available on Amazon Prime in spring 2020. Lynch has also announced on his Facebook page that he has two more films set for release in 2020. The first is about school safety and the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida that took place on February 14, 2018, and the second is called Fighting For Trump. The film is about Lynch's experience of exploring a run for the presidency in 2016, and how he came to support Donald Trump for president despite clashing with the billionaire before the election. Politics On October 24, 2014, after being approached by members of the GOP in Arizona, Texas and Florida, Lynch announced on The Kelly File that he was exploring the possibilities of running for president in 2016.\\"Filmmaker Dennis Michael Lynch Running for President in 2016\\", foxnews.com; retrieved November 20, 2014. Immediately following the show, Megyn Kelly launched a poll asking viewers if they would vote for Lynch. The results were astonishingly positive, with 88.3% stating they would vote for him. On April 17, 2015, Lynch was one of nineteen presidential hopefuls to speak at the Republican Leadership Summit in New Hampshire. A few weeks later, on May 5, 2015, Lynch announced he would not run in 2016 stating multiple reasons, including his children being too young to endure a national campaign that would require his absence from home. Following the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on February 14, 2018, Andrew Pollack asked Dennis Michael Lynch to help him get a school safety bill passed in Florida. Pollack, whose daughter Meadow was killed in the shooting, lobbied alongside Lynch for two days. Ultimately, they grabbed enough yea votes from Democrats and Republicans to get the bill passed. The bill was signed into law days later by Gov. Rick Scott. According to his website, Lynch has been producing a film about the Parkland shooting. The film is scheduled for release in 2020. Television After years of guest appearance on Fox News Channel, on January 16, 2016, Lynch started hosting the news and commentary program Dennis Michael Lynch: Unfiltered on Newsmax TV. The program featured investigative reporting, interviews and commentary with a heavy emphasis on user interaction through social media. The show was the highest rated news program on NewsmaxTV and led the network to record setting ratings. However, on August 10, 2016, he announced that it was his final show because the Newsmax TV management was demanding editorial control over all the Newsmax programs. Claiming he would not accept \\"being restricted,\\" Lynch never returned to Newsmax. In early September 2016, Lynch started a daily program airing on Facebook.com/DMLnewsApp. Originally called the 'Walk & Talk', Lynch spoke into his cell phone about news and politics as he walked around his Long Island neighborhood. His delivery of reporting the news and political commentary often included his impromptu comedy routines. Most of his Walk & Talk episodes went viral, racking up as many as 7,000,000 views per upload. The popularity of the Walk & Talk led Lynch to launch TeamDML.com, which is described on the website as \\"the place where smart conservatives meet.\\" Lynch claims on his website that the membership-based service has attracted thousands of subscribers since its launch in January 2019. DML PURE CBD In July, 2019, Lynch and his wife launched a new company to manufacture and sell his own line of CBD products called DML PURE and MIRACLE ME. The website is DMLcbd.com, and Lynch is the official spokesperson.

The surviving building serves today as a nursing home. The abbey was founded in 1138 by the count of Eguisheim as a daughter house of Lucelle Abbey. In the 13th century, abbot Martin of Pairis preached the Fourth Crusade and then participated in the misfire of it. After taking active part in the sacking of Constantinople, Martin brought several looted relics from there to Pairis, increasing the status of the monastery considerably. The monk Gunther of Pairis wrote an account of the crusade. The abbey was joined to the Abbey of Maulbronn in 1452, confirmed by the Cistercian general chapter in 1453 and Pope Pius II in 1461. In 1648, Maulbronn was turned over to the Protestant Duchy of W√ºrttemberg by the Peace of Westphalia. The Cistercians were forced to leave and they re-established the abbey of Pairis.Fran√ßois Walter and Philippe Andr√© Grandidier, Vues pittoresques de l'Alsace (Strasbourg, 1785).

The incident took place over the small, uninhabited Perejil Island, when a squad of the Royal Moroccan Navy occupied it. After an exchange of declarations between both countries, the Spanish troops eventually evicted the Moroccan infantry who had relieved their Navy comrades. Background Perejil Island (Isla Perejil in Spanish and Jazirat Laila in Arabic) is a small rocky island under Spanish sovereignty and about the size of 15 football fields, lying from Morocco, and from the Spanish city of Ceuta, which borders Morocco, and from mainland Spain. The island itself is unpopulated, only seldom visited by Moroccan shepherds. Moroccan seizure Tensions rose on July 11, 2002, when 12 Moroccan soldiers landed on the island, equipped with light arms, a radio, and several tents. The soldiers raised their nation's flag and set up camp. A patrol boat of the Spanish Civil Guard, in charge of coast guard service in Spain, approached the island from Ceuta during its routine check, when the crew spotted the Moroccan flag flying. The officers disembarked to investigate the issue. When they landed on the island, they were confronted by the Moroccan soldiers, who forced them back into their boat at gunpoint after a bitter argument. Morocco claimed that the occupation was carried out in order to monitor illegal immigration, and to fight drug dealers and smugglers who use the island as a logistic platform.Consiguen el pase de 10 toneladas de droga almacenadas en isla Perejil. El Faro de Ceuta journal Following protests and calls to the return of the status quo from the Spanish government, the soldiers were called off, but were replaced by six Moroccan marines, who set up a fixed base on the island, which drew further protests from Spain. A Moroccan patrol boat was also deployed to the area, and was seen carrying out maneuvers near the Chafarinas Islands. Spain reacted by deploying a frigate, three corvettes, and a submarine to Ceuta and Melilla, and three patrol boats to the vicinity of Perejil island, stationing them about a mile off the island. Reinforcements were also sent to isolated Spanish outposts in the area. Spanish Prime Minister Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar warned Morocco that Spain would not accept a policy of fait accompli. Operation Romeo-Sierra On the morning of July 18, 2002, Spain launched Operation Romeo-Sierra to remove the Moroccan soldiers. The operation was carried out by Spanish special forces unit Grupo de Operaciones Especiales. Four Eurocopter Cougar helicopters that had taken off from Facinas landed 28 Spanish commandos on the island. The entire operation was coordinated by the Spanish Navy from the amphibious ship Castilla, on station at the Strait of Gibraltar. The Spanish Air Force deployed F-18 and Mirage F-1 fighters to provide air cover. The Spanish patrol boats Izaro and Laya came alongside the Moroccan gunboat El Lahiq, at anchor off the island, in order to prevent it from interfering with the operation. The Moroccan Auxiliary Forces members inland did not offer any resistance. Within a matter of minutes, all of six Moroccan servicemen were taken prisoner, and the island was secured. The prisoners were transported by helicopter to the headquarters of Civil Guard in Ceuta, from where they were transported to the Moroccan border. Over the course of the same day, the Spanish commandos on the island were replaced by soldiers of the Spanish Legion. Aftermath The Spanish Legion troops on the island remained there after the operation was complete. The United States mediated the situation, that eventually returned to the status quo ante bellum. All Spanish troops were withdrawn, and the island remains unoccupied but claimed by both sides. BBC News interviewed Spanish citizens across Madrid after the conflict, and most people supported this incursion. Opposition politician Gaspar Llamazares of the United Left party (former Communist Party) said that Spain should not fall into the \\"provocation trap\\", so that it does not ruin its image in North Africa.

Construction and commissioning Myers was laid down as the Rudderow-class destroyer escort USS Myers (DE-595) on 15 January 1944 by Bethlehem-Hingham Shipyard, Inc., at Hingham, Massachusetts, and was launched on 15 February 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Ralph W. Myers, the mother of the ships namesake, Machinist's Mate First Class Merton B. Myers. The ship was reclassified as a Crosley-class high-speed transport and redesignated APD-105 on 17 July 1944. After conversion to her new role, she was commissioned on 26 March 1945 with Lieutenant Donald H. Petterson, USNR, in command.  Service history  After shakedown off Cuba, Myers moved to Norfolk, Virginia, where she trained officers and men assigned to new high-speed transports. After a period of refresher training in the Caribbean, she proceeded to Newport, Rhode Island, to train prospective crews for new aircraft carriers and cruisers. She operated along the United States East Coast for the rest of her active career.  Decommissioning and disposal  Myers was decommissioned on 13 January 1947 and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Green Cove Springs, Florida. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1960 and subsequently sold to the government of Colombia for use as a floating power plant.

Even-aged timber management is a group of forest management practices employed to achieve a nearly coeval cohort group of forest trees. The practice of even-aged management is often pursued to minimize costs to loggers. In some cases, the practices of even aged timber management are frequently implicated in biodiversity loss and other ecological damage. Even-aged timber management can also be beneficial to restoring natural native species succession. Process The first step in even aged timber management is to select a suitable stand for harvest. Trees must be of merchantable size, a desirable species, and in an area accessible to harvesting equipment. Once selected, the stand is harvested (usually using feller-bunchers, skidders, and processors). Merchantable trees (trees with boles large enough to be sold to a mill) are harvested and processed whereas unmerchantable trees (trees that are too small or of an undesirable species) are either crushed by machinery or cut to make equipment movement easier. This process is called clearcutting, and the end result is a cutblock. At this stage, the forestry company is required to replant the same proportion of species that were there previous to harvest. Usually, silviculture techniques are employed to ensure that species survive and grow in the proper proportion. Shade-intolerant species such as trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) and marsh reedgrass (Calamagrostis canadensis) will thrive in the open conditions of a clearcut, outcompeting shade-tolerant species such as white spruce (Picea glauca). Mechanical site preparation and herbicide treatments are often applied initially to allow for adequate shade- tolerant growth. This way, the shade-tolerants are given a head start and the shade-intolerants will catch up over time once silviculture treatments are stopped, resulting in an even-aged stand of trees with little vertical stratification. Economic implications Even-aged forest management is the harvesting system of choice in many parts of the world because it is often considered to be the only method that is economically viable. Forestry operations have extremely high variable costs- per hour expenses for harvesting equipment and per kilometer expenses for log transportation compose a very large portion of the total cost to harvest a stand. Therefore, companies must obtain as much productivity as possible from their hourly equipment in order to be profitable. Uneven-aged management techniques where only certain trees are harvested, such as shelterwood systems, incur the same hourly costs while harvesting fewer trees per hour. This reality explains why in Canada, for example, 90% of forests harvested are done so by clear cut through an even-aged management system. Wildlife considerations Ecological analysis indicates that even aged timber management can produce inferior outcomes for wildlife biodiversity and abundance. Some species thrive on uneven or natural forest tree distribution. For example, the wild turkey thrives when uneven heights and canopy variations exist and its numbers are diminished by even aged timber management. Depending on the ecosystem, however, some species thrive under even aged timber management. Clear cutting closely mimics the results of the most prominent natural disturbance in the boreal forest- wildfires. Certain tree species of this forest type have evolved over time to regenerate favourably in open, well-lit conditions, while others are adapted to thrive in the shade they produce. Clear cutting allows shade intolerant species, such as aspen and jack pine, to regenerate where they could not in a mature forest. Clear cutting areas for even-aged timber management can also benefit many wildlife species. The abundance of coarse woody debris added to the forest floor is beneficial to salamander and snake species, while the release of understory shrubs provides an increase of berry- foraging opportunities for bear and songbirds. In general, the immature, grassy forest regenerated after a clear cut fulfills specific habitat requirements for many species that cannot be found in mature forests. In the boreal forest, for example, wildfire has been suppressed by humans, resulting in many overmature stands. Even aged timber management restores the successional cycle and allows early successional species to recolonize immature habitat.

He is best known for his stint in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) under the ring name EZ Money. He also wrestled for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in its final month of operation under the ring name Jason Jett. Professional wrestling career Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1994) Broyles made his professional wrestling debut in 1990 after training himself. In 1994 he worked for Jim Cornette's Smoky Mountain Wrestling, he was known as Steve Skyfire and was mainly used as a jobber.http://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr;=503&page;=4&year;=1994&promotion;=32 Extreme Championship Wrestling (2000-2001) After working on the independent circuit for ten years, he made his Extreme Championship Wrestling debut on June 2, 2000 under the ring name Steve Skyfire in a losing effort to Chilly Willy. Eight days later, Broyles made his televised debut for ECW as EZ Money in a losing effort to Kid Kash. After wrestling in singles matches to mixed results over the next few weeks, Money formed an alliance with Chris Hamrick. After Hamrick helped Money defeat Julio Fantastico, with whom he had a brief feud, Fantastico joined Money and Hamrick after being unable to defeat them. Fantastico then renamed himself Julio Dinero and the stable became known as Hot Commodity. Hot Commodity was rather unsuccessful, however, as they only won two matches together. Despite this, Money and Dinero were granted a title match against then-World Tag Team Champions Danny Doring and Roadkill on January 7, 2001 at ECW's final pay-per-view Guilty as Charged, which they lost. Money and Dinero received a rematch for the title five days later, but were again defeated. Hot Commodity stayed together until ECW declared bankruptcy in 2001 and was subsequently shut down. World Championship Wrestling and World Wrestling Federation (2001-2002) After ECW declared bankruptcy, Broyles soon started working for World Championship Wrestling. He made his debut for WCW on March 7 episode of Thunder as Jason B, where he and Scotty O lost to 3 Count (Shannon Moore and Evan Karagias) in the quarterfinals of a tournament to determine the promotion's first Cruiserweight Tag Team Champions. The following week on Thunder, Broyles was renamed to Jason Jett and defeated Alex Wright. On March 18 at WCW's final pay-per-view Greed, Jett defeated Kwee Wee. The following night on Nitro, Jett defeated Disqo. On the March 21 episode of Thunder, Jett defeated fellow ECW alumnus Cash in the latter's debut for WCW. Broyles remained with WCW until it was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation in late March, earning the distinction of being the only man to wrestle at the final shows for both ECW and WCW and the last person ever to be signed to a WCW contract. After his contract was picked up by the WWF, he was sent to the Heartland Wrestling Association, one of their development territories. While in the HWA, Broyles won the promotion's Heavyweight Championship twice before being released from his contract in July 2002. Independent circuit and retirement (2002-2007) After being released from his WWF contract, Broyles he made a few appearances in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, Ring of Honor and the Frontier Wrestling Alliance under his EZ Money ring name before retiring in 2003. After retiring, he began working as a tailor for wrestlers, designing attire such as boots and trunks. Comeback (2007-present) On January 27, 2007, Broyles, as EZ Money, wrestled his first match in nearly four years as he defeated The Brother Grimm at Championship Wrestling Alliance's House Party event. On February 17, Money defeated Mathias Grimm at the CWA's Snowed The F Out event. On July 28, Money made his final appearance for the CWA as he won a four-way match against Chase Owens, Greg Rocker, and O-Dog. On October 12, 2013, Broyles, as EZ Money teamed with Eddie Golden in a losing effort to the NWA Tennessee Tag Team Champions Air America (Skylar Kruze and Gavin Daring) in a title match for NWA Smoky Mountain. On June 14, 2014, EZ Money teamed with Reborn Champion Cody Ices and Anthony Brody in a losing effort against Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts, The Stallion and Alex Cage in the main event for Reborn Wrestling.http://prowrestling.net/article.php?6-14-Reborn-Wrestling- Jake-Roberts-and-EZ-Money-meet-in-the-six-man-tag-main-event-of-a-Christian- based-pro-wrestling-show-37554 Retrieved June 15, 2014 On September 26, 2015 EZ Money lost against Ethan Carter III in a match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship.

Limber tail syndrome, or acute caudal myopathy, is a disorder of the muscles in the tail, usually affecting working dogs. It is an injury occurring mostly in sporting or working dogs such as English Pointers, English Setters, Foxhounds, Beagles, and Labrador Retrievers. Limber tail syndrome is also known as swimmer's tail, cold water tail, broken tail, dead tail, \\"happy tail\\" or broken wag. Signs and symptoms The injury affects the tail of the dog, causing it to be painful at or near its base. Limber tail can be recognized by a very flaccid tail, or a tail that is held horizontally for approximately 10 cm, and then drops vertically. The condition is also more pronounced in dogs that wag their tails a lot. Cause Limber tail normally occurs shortly (within 24 hours) after swimming in water that is too cold or, on rare occasions, too warm. The actual cause is unknown but it may be caused by the narrowing of the space through which the spinal cord passes, typically due to degenerative change to the inter vertebral disk spaces. These underlying changes may not lead to visible change until the problem is suddenly exacerbated, such as during physical activity, after trauma, etc. Occasionally other changes are seen prior to or in conjunction with limber tail disease, such as urinary or fecal incontinence, postural abnormalities in the pelvic limb, or pain in response to touching the lower back. Treatment With rest, the tail returns to normal within a few days. Pain relief, such as a nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug may be administered. The symptoms may recur.

The series was a variety/news magazine show oriented towards kids with the intention of recognizing them as people. During its four-year run, the series was nominated for five Emmy Awards and won the 1978 Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Entertainment Series. The series included celebrity interviews, cartoons, music, and other information that appealed to children. History Bob McAllister had hosted a popular New York City-based children's TV series, Wonderama, for over a decade when the series was taken off the air in 1977. As the host, McAllister sang the closing theme song \\"Kids Are People Too\\". Shortly after that series was taken off the air, ABC offered him another series that tried to capitalize on Wonderama's more than 20 years of children's entertainment by using the song's title as the new series title. However, the show that he was hired to emcee on ABC was aimed at teens, not the younger children McAllister preferred, and this led to creative disputes with the producers and network executives over the portrayal of violence. In November 1978, McAllister was fired from Kids Are People Too and was replaced by Michael Young and later by actor/singer Randy Hamilton (who, at the same time, was playing Rikki Dekker on the NBC soap opera Texas) as the program's hosts. The series later returned as a weekly syndicated program during the 1986-87 season, with Michael Young back as host. Format The series was a variety/news magazine show for kids. Every week it would have a celebrity guest who the host would interview, occasionally a psychologist would speak about the challenges of growing up, and there would be comedy or musical routines. Each episode also included a segment called \\"Dear Alex and Annie\\" (with William Bingham as Alex and Donna Drake as Annie), answering viewers' questions on a wide range of personal and social topics that were relevant to kids. The series attracted guests such as Bill Cosby, Debbie Harry, Billy Dee Williams, Cheap Trick, Patti Smith and Brooke Shields. Just like CBS's Kids Say the Darndest Things, the show often produced unexpected results when the host would ask the audience questions. When KISS replaced drummer Peter Criss, they introduced their new drummer, Eric Carr, on a July 1980 episode of Kids Are People TooKiss: Kissology Volume II 1978‚Äì1991. DVD. 2007. Prior to the band's coming out on stage, the host asked an audience member, \\"Who's your favorite band member?\\" The youth responded, \\"Peter Criss. Er, um, I mean... Ace Frehley.\\" Kids Are People Too was seen the first two seasons as 90 minute versions in most major city markets including Chicago, New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Detroit, and it also featured locally-produced cutaway segments by the ABC O&O; stations in these markets.

Supported by online advertising, it was one of few services at the time to offer free integrated community services including chat rooms, message boards, and free personal web pages. Extremely popular during the mid to late 1990s in the era prior to the Dot-com bust, WBS was the largest and best-known social media website of its time. In 1998, WBS was acquired by the search engine Infoseek, which was in turn acquired by Disney/ABC. The original WebChat Broadcasting System closed on 15 September 1999 after its chat rooms were integrated into Disney's existing Go Network chat rooms. A revival of WBS was launched in 2009 and is virtually identical to the original community.WebChat Broadcasting System (Beta) - WBS.NET. Retrieved on 25 September 2013. Features WBS featured browser-based chat, real-time discussion, with moderated chat rooms in addition to user-created private chat rooms. Common to webchat, its chat rooms required no software download to use. It allowed users to upload their own images into chat sessions and had three chat modes: streaming, frames, and no frames. In addition to images users could add audio, video, and hotlinks to conversations. WBS also featured other services, such as email, and allowed users to create and maintain personal web pages. Membership was free. History Founding WBS was founded as the Internet Roundtable Society in 1990 by Michael J. Fremont and Wendie Bernstein Lash in Menlo Park, California. It began as an \\"edutainment\\" company featuring such content as live Internet broadcasts of interviews with prominent individuals in science, technology, and pop culture, but began focusing on chat in 1993, whereupon the name was changed to the WebChat Broadcasting System. Growth IRC had existed as a dedicated chatting network but was mostly used by seasoned Internet users. Chat websites capitalized on the growing base of Internet general users by providing a simpler, more attractive chatting interface. Chatting became focused on community and socialization. In August 1996, WBS had 500,000 users and was growing by 3,000 users a day. In February 1997, WBS reached a milestone of 1 million registered users, accruing 4,000 new registered users and 5.5 million page views every day. Registrations were not confirmed. At this point, it was featuring 200 individual affinity groups. Within a week of the launch of a new feature to allow members to create their own home pages, over 15,000 members had begun using it. In May 1997, WBS had 1.4 million registered users. The other large web chat company at this time was WebGenesis Inc.'s The Globe. Also internet service provider AOL had over 14,000 chat rooms available to their customers through their non-web interface. In June 1997, WBS hit 1.5 million registered users and had 7 million daily page views with over 200 rooms. WBS frequently hosted real-time multimedia programming events, which only increased as its popularity grew. Such events attracted celebrities such as Tom Clancy, the celebrity cast of Star Trek, bands Soundgarden and Metallica, the former president of PBS, Lawrence Grossman from NBC News, United States Senator Arlen Specter, Intel CEO Andy Grove and feminist Gloria Steinem. Rise of instant messaging Web-based chatting in general became less popular with the rise of instant messaging desktop applications in the 1990s. ICQ was first released in November 1996. AOL Instant Messenger was released in May 1997. Yahoo! Pager, later renamed Yahoo! Messenger, launched on 9 March 1998. AOL acquired ICQ's parent company Mirabilis on 8 June 1998. Microsoft launched MSN Messenger, later renamed Windows Live Messenger, on 22 July 1999. Infoseek buyout and demise Infoseek bought out WBS for approximately $6.7 million, or about 350,000 shares of Infoseek stock in April 1998. At the time WBS had 2.7 million users. WBS daily page views were down to 5 million in April, 1998. When Infoseek acquired WBS there had been several web portals that added chat as a service. Lycos had bought the Tripod community in February 1998 and Yahoo had added a deal with GeoCities in January 1998. There was strong competition between the web portals to match each other's services. WBS, at the time of the Infoseek acquisition, had 2.7 million registered users. This total was more than the membership of Tripod and GeoCities combined. WBS had only 350,000 personal homepages at the time. Infoseek's three main competitors at the time were Lycos, Yahoo, and Excite. In 1998, Infoseek was bought by the Go Network. On September 15, 1999, WBS was shut down and many of the more popular rooms were transferred to Go's Java-based chat system. All that was left for the members at that time was a simple message saying, \\"Go.Com has decided to close down WBS and move its most popular rooms to the chat rooms at Go.Com. Your home pages will still be viewable for an undetermined amount of time. Thank you for supporting WBS during its existence.\\" By the Spring of 2000, all home pages had been deleted. Go.com abandoned chat entirely in 2001. Migration After its demise, many patrons of WBS migrated to other chat sites where some of the general topic rooms were recreated. Notable sites created in the wake of WBS' closure included bigbob.com and mywbs.com, both of which were created by former WBS chatters, utilizing a similar browser-based chat system. It is likely that many WBS users migrated to instant messaging software, the popularity of which was increasing substantially at that time. Martin Foster developed software that offered several of the features of the original WBS and IFC that had gained popularity. This code has been used in developing numerous chat sites which have attracted many former patrons of the original WBS, especially those who frequented the roleplaying rooms. It was originally developed to power Ethereal Realms, but the site now merely hosts the software for use on other sites. Audience WBS offered a wide array of chat rooms categorized into hubs. Many rooms were dedicated to affinity groups based on age, race/ethnicity, religion, and sexuality. Others were specific to topics such as dating, entertainment, computers and the internet, travel, video games, roleplaying games, and the arts. The site would eventually host around 260 different chat rooms. Executives President and CEO Bayard Winthrop was a frequent spokesperson for the company. After its buyout, he co- founded Freebord, a San Francisco-based sporting goods manufacturer, in January 2001. From 2008 to 2011, Winthrop was the CEO of Chrome Industries. He left in March 2011 and proceeded to found American Giant. 2009 revival In July 2009, a revival of WBS, nearly identical to the original community, was launched. Most of the original chat rooms and features have been retained or recreated. The most noticeable differences are the lack of personal homepages and the chat rooms are not moderated.

He served as the chairman of the company's board of directors until 1998. Gonzalez Nova remained the honorary chairman of the Comercial Mexicana chain until his death in 2009.  Kirsty MacColl's death  Singer Kirsty MacColl was killed when struck by a boat which was illegally within a designated diving area in 2000. The powerboat involved in the accident was owned by Gonz√°lez Nova, who was on board with members of his family. One of his employees, boathand Jos√© Cen Yam, stated that he was in control of the boat at the time of the incident. Eyewitnesses said that Cen Yam was not at the controls and that the boat was travelling much faster than the speed of one knot that Gonz√°lez Nova said. Cen Yam was found guilty of culpable homicide. People who said they spoke to Cen Yam after the accident said he received money for taking the blame.  Death  Carlos Gonz√°lez Nova died early Wednesday, August 19, 2009, at the age of 92.

She took part in one medal-worthy boat action and participated in captures of a number of merchant vessels, was present at two notable occasions, the surrender of the Dutch fleet in the Vlieter Incident and the capture of Alexandria, and her crew participated in two land attacks on forts. She was broken up in 1809. Design Wells & Co. of Rotherhithe built Cynthia with a shallow draught and three daggerboards (John Schank's sliding keels) for stability. She was rated for 18 guns but during construction her rating was reduced to sixteen 6-pounder guns; she also carried fourteen half-pound swivels, although the latter were probably replaced by a much smaller number of carronades during her career. Service during the French Revolutionary Wars Cynthia was commissioned in March 1796 under Commander Micajah Malbon. Thirteen months later, Cynthia, in company with , , , and the hired armed cutter Grand Falconer captured the American ship Favourite on 19 April 1797. On 5 October Cynthia was in company with Diamond, and when they captured the Spanish ship Nostra Senora Del Carmen. Cynthia, Cormorant and recaptured the American vessel Betty. Then on 24 Nov 1797 she was in company with Cormorant and Grand Falconer when they captured the French merchant sloop Necessaire. On 15 February 1798 Cynthia was in company with Cormorant when they captured the Prussian galiot Welwaert. On 28 August 1799, Cynthia was with the British fleet that captured the Dutch hulks Drotchterland and Brooderschap, and the ships Helder, Venus, Minerva, and Hector, in the New Diep, in Holland. A partial pay-out of prize money resulted in a payment of 6s 8d to each seaman that had been in the fleet that day. The capture of these vessels was part of the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland and preceded by two days the Vlieter Incident in which a large part of the navy of the Batavian Republic, commanded by Rear-Admiral Samuel Story, surrendered to the British navy on a sandbank near the Channel known as De Vlieter, near Wieringen. Cynthia was also among the vessels sharing in the prize money from the Dutch vessels of the Vlieter Incident. On 4 June 1800, Cynthia was part of a squadron under Captain Edward Pellew in Impetueux. The 32-gun frigate , Captain William Lukin, Cynthia, and some small-craft, attacked the south-west end of Quiberon and silenced the forts. Troops under Major Ramsey then landed and destroyed the forts. The attack resulted in the British taking several vessels and scuttling others. The only casualties were in Cynthia, which lost two men killed and one wounded. Because Cynthia was with Pellew's squadron for a time, she benefited from the prize or salvage money for the Vigilant, Menais, Industry, Insolent,Ann and for the wreck of a vessel sold. Vessels of the squadron had made the captures, which they then shared with the remainder. Cynthia also shared in the proceeds from the recapture of the Lancaster on 28 June. On 25 August Cynthia, now under Commander John Dick, was in a squadron and convoy under the command of Rear-Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren. She participated in another attack on a fort at the bay of Playa de Dominos (Doni√±os), outside the port of Ferrol, together with the 74-gun Imp√©tueux, the 28-gun frigate , and the 14-gun hired armed cutter St Vincent. The vessels silenced the battery, which was armed with eight 24-pounders. Then seamen from the ships landed to assist a large force of army troops to haul the guns up to the heights above Ferrol. However, it became apparent that Ferrol was too well fortified. The Navy then reembarked the troops and the whole British force withdrew. Four days later, in Vigo Bay, Admiral Sir Samuel Hood assembled a cutting-out party from the vessels under his command consisting of two boats each from Cynthia, , , and , four boats from , as well as the boats from , and Impetueux The party went in and after a 15-minute fight captured the French privateer Gu√™pe, of Bordeaux and towed her out. She was of 300 tons burthen and had a flush deck. Pierced for 20 guns, she carried eighteen 9-pounders, and she and her crew of 161 men were under the command of Citizen Dupan. In the attack she lost 25 men killed, including Dupan, and 40 wounded. British casualties amounted to four killed, 23 wounded and one missing. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"29 Aug. Boat Service 1800\\" to all surviving claimants from the action. On 5 December Cynthia and the gunvessel were in company with the 36-gun frigate when Florentina captured the French polacre Union, bound from Alexandria to France with a cargo of rice and coffee. Two days later, the same three vessels captured the French brig Bon Pasteur Retrouve on the same route with rice, coffee and sugar. Six days after that, the same three vessels captured the French brig Heureuse Clairon and her cargo of rice and coffee. On 19 February 1801, Cynthia and Florentina were among the vessels sharing in the capture of the Rosa. On 9 June Cynthia was among the vessels participating in the capture of the Felicite and Josephine, off Alexandria. Then on 28 July she shared in the capture of the Almas di Purgatoria, also off Alexandria. In August 1801, Cynthia participated in the Egyptian operations. In the morning of 17 August, after the Battle of Alexandria and the subsequent siege, Captain Alexander Cochrane in the 74-gun Ajax, with the sixth-rate Bonne Citoyenne, Cynthia, the brig-sloops Port Mahon and Victorieuse, and three Turkish corvettes, were the first vessels to enter the harbour. Because Cynthia served in the navy's Egyptian campaign between 8 March 1801 and 2 September, her officers and crew qualified for the clasp \\"Egypt\\" to the Naval General Service Medal that the Admiralty authorised in 1850 for all surviving claimants.> In 1801 or 1802, Lord Elgin requested that Cynthia help transport some cases of the so-called Elgin marbles, but her captain, Commander Wright, declined.St. Clair, p.114 One of Cynthias last tasks was to transport ten Army mutineers from Gibraltar on 12 January 1803 to Portsmouth, where seven were transferred to Calcutta on 21 April for transport to Australia.Tipping, p.34 Fate In February 1803 Cynthia was laid up in ordinary at Chatham. She broken up in 1809. Notes, citations, and references Notes Citations References *Colledge, J.J.

History Lawn Tennis was founded on June 27, 1884, by a group of English immigrants, and had Juan P. Gallagher Gibbs as their first chairman. Its original headquarters were in the Parque de la Exposici√≥n, but it later moved to the Jes√∫s Mar√≠a district in the early 20th century. The club is the usual ground for the Peru Davis Cup team's matches. The club's main sports are Tennis, along with swimming, volleyball, badminton, squash and Paleta Front√≥n. Football Lawn Tennis' footballing section was active in the early days of Peruvian football, but it only entered official competitions for the first time in 1927, when it won the Divisi√≥n Intermedia, attaining promotion to the 1928 Primera Divisi√≥n. The team was relegated in that championship, but won the Divisi√≥n Intermedia in the following year again; after two years in the first level, Lawn Tennis broke away from the Peruvian Football Federation. The team returned to football in 1983, playing in the Segunda Divisi√≥n, where it finished in last; the team returned to the Segunda Divisi√≥n in 1986, and continued disputing that championship until it was relegated in 1991; However, after the relegation, Meteor merged with it, allowing it to continue participating in the Segunda Divisi√≥n; the fusion stood until 1994, when Meteor broke away, and at the same time, Lawn Tennis' football section also split from the main club. The club was champion of the 1997 Segunda Divisi√≥n Peruana, attaining promotion to the Torneo Descentralizado, where it remained for only one season before being relegated. The team eventually was relegated from the Segunda Divisi√≥n in 2002, returning to the Jes√∫s Mar√≠a district league, where it has remained ever since.

CONAP was created by Decree 4-89, or the Law of Protected Areas (in Spanish: Ley de Areas Protegidas, LAP) gave jurisdiction to over the System of Protected Areas of Guatemala (in Spanish: Sistema Guatemalteco de √Åreas Protegidas, SIGAP), which is the conglomeration of all protected areas, and those under special protection in the country.  Background  Up until the 1950s, the northern Peten had been largely disconnected from the State despite being the largest department in the country. Economic activity was mostly restrained to ranching and the harvest of chicle and xate with almost complete absence of regulatory agencies. Ranchers and indigenous communities, like the Maya Q‚Äôechi that had migrated from the Alta Verapaz region in the 19th century, composed most of the scattered population in the region. However, after the coup of 1954 that ended the Arbenz administration, the region became the ‚Äúescape valve to the agrarian problems of Guatemala‚Äù (El√≠as, S.; Gellert, G.; Pape, E. y Reyes, E. (1997). Evaluaci√≥n de la sostenibilidad en Guatemala. FLACSO: Guatemala, Guatemala.) by becoming the source of land grants offered to the landless, indigenous and peasant populations disenfranchised by the overturning of the land reform. This was the onset of the colonization process that would later be formalized by the creation of a government agency with the mission to develop and integrate the Peten region with the rest of the country . In 1959, Congress created the National Enterprise for the Economic Development of Pet√©n (Spanish: Empresa de Fomento y Desarrollo de Pet√©n, FYDEP) through the passing of Decree 1286. According to Michael Painter, FYDEP had the following objectives: 1) To manage and build infrastructure to foment agricultural, industrial, and touristic development in Peten 2) To exploit the region's natural resources, except oil, for domestic and foreign markets 3) To sell land to landless countrymen for the production of basic grains and as a way to help reduce the political demands for land reform in the south 4) To place settlers in cooperatives along the western borders with Mexico to bar Mexican colonists from entering Peten and prevent Mexican construction of hydroelectric facilities near the border 5) To promote medium scale capitalized cattle ranching in central and south Peten. The result was the expansion of agriculture, ranching, logging, extraction of forest products and the construction of unsophisticated infrastructure, schools and health facilities (Painter). Many of these activities grew with minimal oversight from the government and FYDEP. By 1990, satellite imagery showed that 40% of Peten had been deforested and another 10% degraded. Some attribute the neglect of sustainable development by the Guatemalan government to be a result of the close involvement of the military in State affairs, whose concerns in regards to the jungle were insurrections and lacked the know-how and interest in environmental protection.(El Cambio es Posible: 20 a√±os de Experiencias Innovadoras en los Recursos Naturales en Guatemala) By 2000, FYDEP had estimated a population in Peten of about 50, 000; although, there were already 64,000 people living in the region by 1973. FYDEP was disintegrated by the government in 1986 due to criticisms of its inability to control both the process of colonization and the growth of illegal logging practices, albeit, the damage to the region had already been done with the agricultural frontier quickly growing deeper north into the forest.  Organization  In 1989, Guatemala passed the Law of Protected Areas (LAP) in order to combat the rapid rate of deforestation around the country. LAP created the National Council for Protected Areas, whose legal function are stipulated by Decree 4-89 as the executive coordinator of conservation efforts. It meets every two weeks or at the discretion of the acting President, as directed by Article 67. The main objectives of CONAP are stated in Article 62: # To promote and foster conservation and the improvement of the natural heritage of Guatemala # To organize, direct, and develop the System of Protected Areas in Guatemala (SIGAP) # To plan, conduct, and enforce the National Strategy for Conservation of Biological Diversity and Renewable Natural Resources in Guatemala # To coordinate the administration of resources for flora and fauna and the biological diversity of the nation, through their respective executive entities # To plan and coordinate the application of regulations in regards to the conservation of biological diversity contained in international agreements ratified by Guatemala # To create a national fund for the conservation of nature, sustained by financial resources resulting from domestic and foreign collaboration. CONAP has three governing entities: # _The Presidency_ \\\\- Article 64 of Decree 4-98 states that the position will be carried out by the National Coordinator of the Environment (in Spanish: Coordinador Nacional del Medio Ambiente) but the responsibilities can be transferred to a Council member in the case of an emergency. # _The Executive Secretary_ \\\\- Article 70 details the role to be that of a director of the administrative and technical operations of CONAP and SIGAP that include holding meetings, participation in meetings (without voting power), approval of the budget, oversight of all personnel, and administrative changes for the improvement of daily operations. As stated in Article 71, this position can only be held by someone born in Guatemala, in minimal possession of a graduate degree, with at least three years experience in Protected Areas Administration, in full ownership of their civil rights. # _The Executive Sub-Secretary_ \\\\- Article 74 grants the Executive Secretary the power to appoint an Executive Sub-Secretary, who would have to meet the same requirements as the Executive Secretary, and be given specific functions at the time of appointment. In the case that the Executive Secretary is absent or unable to fulfill their responsibilities, the Sub- Secretary will take their place.

National System of Protected Areas in Guatemala (SIGAP)  SIGAP was created under Article 2 of Decree 4-89 with the intent to unify all protected areas in the country and their administrative entities to facilitate the ‚Äúconservation, rehabilitation, improvement and protection of the country‚Äôs natural resources and its biological diversity.‚Äù It would be composed of all previously declared protected areas, areas declared as protected under Article 89, and areas of special protection listed by Article 90.  Protected Areas  LAP declared the following as protected areas: # _Biotope Mario Dary Rivera_ for the preservation of the Quetzal, located in Purulha, Baja Verapaz # _Biotope Cerro Cahu_ i, located in the Department of Peten. # _Biotope Chocon Machacas_ for the conservation of the Manatee, located the Department of Izabal # _Biotope Laguna del Tigre - Rio Escondido_ , located in the northwest region of the Department of Peten # _Biotopo el Zotz, San Miguel la Palotada_ , located in the northern region of the Department of Peten # _Biotopo Naachtun Dos Lagunas_ , located in the northern region of the Department of Peten # _Laguna Lachua National Park_ located in Alta Verapaz LAP declared the following as special protection areas: # _Yolnabaj_ , located in the Department of Huehetenango # _Cuchumatanes_ , located in the Department of Huehuetenango and the Department of Quiche # _El Caba_ , located in the Department of Quiche # _Manchon-Huamuchai_ , located in the southern coast of the Department of Retalhuleu and the Department of San Marcos # _Boca Costa_ of the volcanoes in the southwest region of the country # _Sierra Aral_ , located in the Department of Izabal # _Cerro San Gil Ecological Reserve_ , located in the Department of Izabal # _Punta de Manabique_ , located in the northern region of the Department of Izabal # _Sierra de Santa Cruz_ , located in the Department of Izabal # _Montana Espiritu Santo_ , located in the western region of the Department of Izabal # _Sierra Chinaja_ , located in the northern region of the Department of Alta Verapaz # _El Pino de Poptun Ecological Reserve_ , located in the Department of Peten # Extension of the _Yaxja-Yaloch National Park_ , located in the Department of Peten # _Vida Silvestre Refuge_ and _Altar de los Sacrificios Cultural Monument_ and _Laguna Ixoche_ , located in the Department of Peten # _Semuc-Champey National Monument_ , located in the Department of Alta Verapaz # _Cumbre de Maria Tecun_ , located in the Department of Totonicapan # _Ipala Volcano_ , located in the Department of Chiquimula # _Fraternidad Biosphere Reserve_ , located in the Department of Chiquimula # _Sarstun River_ , in the northern region of the Department of Izabal # _Tecpan Mountains_ , located in the Department of Chimaltenango # _Sabanas de San Francisco_ # The Ecological Reserves and National Monuments located in the volcanic cones of the country # _Xacaxa_ , located in the Department of Chimaltenango # _Cumbre Alta_ , located between the Department of Izabal and the Department of Zacapa # _Chiquibul River_ , in the Department of Peten # _Laguna Perdida_ , located in the Department of Peten # _Laguna del Rio Salinas_ , located in the Department of Peten # _Sabana del Sos Ecological Reserve_ , located in the Department of Peten # _San Rafael Pixcaya Multiple Use Zone_ , located in the Department of Chimaltenango # _Laguna de Guija_ , located in the Department of Jutiapa # _San Isidro Cafetales_ , _Cumbre de Chiramay_ , located in the Department of Chiquimula # _Valle de la Arada_ , located in the Department of Chiquimula # _Laguna de Ayarza_ , located in the Department of Santa Rosa # _Laguna Chic- Choc_ , located in the Department of Alta Verapaz # _Abaj-Takalic Archeological Site_ , located in the Department of Retalhuleu # _Mirador Rio Azul National Park_ , located in the Department of Peten # _Uaxactun-Carmelita Multiple Use Reserve_ , located in the Department of Peten # Other areas that act as biological connectors between these areas Beyond the areas specified areas listed in Decree 4-89 (and updated by Decree 110-96), SIGAP consists in total of 152 protected areas within the country. Specific categories of protection include national parks, biotopes, biosphere reserves, areas with several uses, forest reserves, natural monuments, cultural monuments, scenic routes and trails, marine parks, regional parks, recreational parks, and private nature reserves  Maya Biosphere Reserve  (in Spanish: Reserva de la Biosfera Maya, RBM) In 1990, the Maya Biosphere Reserve was created through Decree 5-90 setting apart 2,112,940 hectares of land in the northern Peten region for environmental protection under the jurisdiction of CONAP (Gomez and Mendez). The policies adopted for the coordination of the RBM are laid out through Annual Plans of Operations, Planes Operativos Anuales (POAs), Mater Plans and other documentation that is approved by CONAP. The RBM is not administered directly by CONAP, whose role is mostly as a coordinator, instead it delegates authority over to other entities with claims to the RBM, to non- governmental organizations, and concessions. Entities with claims to the RBM are those that have a specific stake in the area, such as IDAHE and CECON, or even those whose collaboration would be necessitated to achieve the preservation of biodiversity. Article 57 gives CONAP the ability to partner with NGO's as ‚Äúrepresentative and executive agents.‚Äù Historically, NGO's have made up for CONAP's lack of technical assistance and community development in the concession areas. Decree 5-90 also established three different types of zones, each with its own laws and regulations, within the RBM. The three zones are: # Nucleus Zones (National Parks and Protected Biotopes: 767,000 hectares; 36% of RBM) # Multiple Use Zones (in Spanish: Zonas de Usos Multiple, MUZ) (848,440 hectares; 40% of RBM) # Buffer Zones (497,500 hectares; 24% of the RBM) (Plan Maestro) As CIFOR's Occasional Paper #49 states,‚ÄùWithin this framework, CONAP's mandate was to halt illegal logging, the advancement of the agricultural cattle frontier, the sacking of archaeological site and illegal traffic in drugs, fauna, and migrant workers.  Multiple Use Zones  The MUZs were established as a way to meet the expectations and needs of both the private sector and the heterogeneous communities already existing within the bounds of the area when they were declared as protected. The different needs were met by dividing the MUZ into concessions that would be given to legally recognized entities that would determine the nature and extent of forest resource extraction within their respective area. Twenty-two concessions were given in total. The forest industries that were already present in northern Peten received two concessions. Six concessions were granted to communities located inside the MUZ, and another six were granted to bordering communities. The remaining eight smaller concessions (from 900 to 5,300 ha, in comparison to 4,800 to 72,500 ha) were given to cooperatives in the Buffer Zone along the Uxumacinta River.  Community Forestry Concessions  Of the total 2,112,940 hectares that make up the RBM, 445,804 hectares are under the management of community concessions, or portions of protected forest within the Multiple Use Zone of the Maya Biosphere Reserve given to specific communities for their stewardship. Community concession were determined to be the optimal way to settle disputes of how the newly granted protected status of the land would affect interest groups already living in northern Peten. To qualify for a concession, communities needed to become legally recognized by the State and be sponsored by an NGO to ensure the concession would have the technical support and administrative assistance to make forest resource extraction sustainable. Once qualified, the recognized organization signs a contract with the Guatemalan government that lasts 25 years and allows the rational use of wood, the extraction on non-wood products, and development of tourism. A major criticism of the concession scheme has been the blatant disregard for the social, political, and economic dynamics of the people living within each concession. Community cohesion was questionable in most cases as a direct result of how unrelated to one another the groups were that constituted the ‚Äúcommunities.‚Äù Many of these peoples, alliances, and new settlers simply banded together in order to qualify for a concession; therefore, had different, if not opposing, views on how forest areas should be managed. For example, the ‚ÄúPeteneros,‚Äù or those that had moved to the region in the early 1920s and were regarded as the locals, relied primarily on the trade of chicle, xate, and mahogany and had been working the forest with no government interference and had developed illegal logging and migration networks with surrounding countries. Other groups came into the region starting in the 1950s as part of the peasant migration initiated by the state-sponsored colonization effort and became ranchers, farmers, artisans, loggers, etc., with the prospect of land linking them together. The Guatemalan government had also used the region as a way to appease the armed conflict by providing the land to displaced peasants, guerilleros, and war refugees returning from Mexico that resulted from the signing of the 1996 Peace Accords. Overall, this showed the concession scheme to have been minimally planned with no consultation from the affected communities.  ACOFOP  In 1995, during the concession negotiations community members in areas that could potentially benefit from concessions organized in order to oppose the possibility of concessions to be given to the private sector. This group became the Consejo Consultivo de Comunidades Forestales de Pet√©n (CONCOFOP). After becoming legally recognized, it became the Asociacion de Comunidades Forestales de Pet√©n (ACOFOP). Its main objectives were to develop social and human capital within the communities and promote sustainable models for extraction. ACOFOP played a crucial role in helping the communities attain legal statuses as associations, civil societies or even cooperatives in order to be eligible for concessions. The approval several community concessions can be linked to ACOFOP's advocacy. CIFOR indicates that by 2005, ACOFOP's membership of 22 communities and organizations represented 14,000 individuals in 30 communities and managed a total of 500,000 hectares, of which 70% has been certified by the Forest Stewardship Council.  FORESCOM  FORESCOM (Empresa Comunitaria de Servicios del Bosque) was established in 2003 as a private company from the same community organizations that together comprise ACOFOP. The origins of FORESCOM stem from the idea of reducing the costs of marketing, forest management, certification, infrastructure development and maintenance and other related expenses required for the operations of concessions by creating ‚Äúblocks‚Äù of forest with neighboring communities. As CONAP matures as an independent government institution, the more that international assistance has been fleeing the RBM and affecting the funding for many of the NGO's that were committed to the communities to provide the needed technical assistance and entrepreneurial expertise for the proper management of the forest leading to the financial burden of conservation to fall more and more on the communities. CONAP has readjusted some regulations to make it possible for communities to choose certified forest agents to fulfill the would-be roles of NGO's. Many of these agents have already been contracted by FORESCOM, but FORESCOM is also becoming one of these certified forest agents to be able to provide these services itself. Estimates have been made that upon completion of certification, FORESCOM will create a 20% reduction in the cost of audits and recertification required every five years. Additionally, USAID donated $300,000 to develop road infrastructure leading to and within concession areas for more environmentally friendly transport of products. Besides providing marketing, accounting and financial planning services, FORESCOM is also considering expanding their capacities to include processing of wood materials to meet the demands of an international market for dry and semi-processed wood and to add value to the products coming out of the concessions. Due to its close ties with ACOFOP, the Forest Stewardship Council, the certifying body of forest agents, will have to oversee concerns for corruption and quality deterioration. Although the certification from the FSC does not add value or open markets to concession products, it does help the community forestry framework maintain a ‚Äúgreen image‚Äù by indicating strict rules for forest management.  Narco Ganaderia  Illegal activity in the Peten region has historical precedents in the logging industry and periods of land-grabs. However, in the recent years the drug trade in the RBM has been growing drastically to the point that it poses one of the greatest threats to the protected areas. The RBM is attractive to drug traffickers as it is remote meaning many portions can only be reached on foot and the lack of government oversight coupled with fluid borers to ease the movement of drugs in and out of the country. Many of the forest fires that occur in the region are deliberate attempts by traffickers to clear areas for labs, runway strips, and grazing land for cattle used as a way to launder profits from the drug trade. Since January 2016, Guatemalan authorities have 2,588 kilograms of cocaine (valued at $34.7 million), 17.6 million poppy plants (valued at $57.6 million), and 570,316 marijuana plants (valued at $28 million). The same authorities estimate that over 8,000 hectares of protected land have been burned because of the drug trade.

He enlisted in the U.S. Navy on August 23, 1939 at Indianapolis, Indiana.The Dictionary of Naval Fighting Ships provides identical birth dates and locations and identical enlistment dates and locations for both William J.

Myers (at http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/m16/myers.htm), both of whom died at the same time in the Karin boarding attempt. This almost impossible coincidence in both date and place of birth, of enlistment, and of death in action suggests that the Dictionary of Naval Fighting Ships is in error concerning some or all of this information for one or both men. Other sources merely repeat the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships entries and are of no assistance in clearing up the matter. As a machinist's mate first class, Myers was serving in the destroyer in the South Atlantic Ocean when on March 10, 1943 Eberle intercepted the German blockade runner Karin. Myers volunteered for the boarding party which valiantly tried to save Karin from demolition charges set by her crew. All efforts were to no avail; after helping his shipmates to escape the sinking death trap, Myers was killed in a violent explosion. Awards For his gallant sacrifice in the boarding of Karin, Myers was awarded the Silver Star posthumously. Namesake The U.S. Navy destroyer escort USS Myers (DE-595) was named for Machinist Mate First Class Myers. She was converted during construction into the high-speed transport , and was in commission as such from 1945 to \`1947.

Subsequent findings since the mid- 1990s indicate, however, that the amphoras originate in Byzantine, or even early Islamic, Aqaba. Hence, the preferred nomenclature is now \\"Aqaba Amphora.\\" The Ayla-Axum/Aqaba amphora type has parallels from at least three terrestrial sites in Eritrea and Ethiopia: Aksum, where amphora sherds with gray fabric were found by the Deutsche Aksum Expedition (Zahn 1913: 208); Matara dating to the 4th through 7th centuries (Anfray 1990: 118); and Adulis (Paribeni 1907: 551) examples of which are on display in the National Museum in Asmara. Other examples have been found at Berenike in Egypt, where the amphoras date firmly to an early 5th century context in what may be the best stratified examples (Hayes 1996: 159-61); from Aqaba in Jordan where many examples have been found, including their kilns; on The Shipwreck at Black Assarca Island, Eritrea (Pedersen 2008; Pedersen 2000); and in the Mediterranean such as on the late 6th-century shipwreck at Iskandil Burnu, Turkey, as well as in Spain and Carthage in strata datable from the mid-fourth to the sixth centuries (Keay 1986: 356, 358, 471). The largest number (c. 500) came to light during excavations at Zafar/Yemen. In 2013, an archaeological expedition to Saudi Arabia led by Ralph K. Pedersen, then guest professor at Philipps University Marburg, discovered a shipwreck containing Aqaba amphoras. The site was discovered by Marburg student Matthias Link during a survey along a reef.

Background In July 1967, Dave Davies readied his first solo single, credited entirely under his name (although co-written by his brother and fellow Kinks member Ray Davies), entitled \\"Death of a Clown\\". In the past, as a member of the Kinks, Dave Davies had only released his own compositions on B-sides and as part of larger LPs. The Kinks' record label sensed potential sales in a solo release from the overlooked Davies, and issued \\"Death of a Clown\\" as his debut. Although credited to Davies, it was technically a Kinks recording, as his backing band was, in fact, the Kinks. Upon release, \\"Death of a Clown\\" unexpectedly rose to number three on the UK Singles Chart. Wanting to profit off the new buzz that was suddenly surrounding Davies, a solo LP was scheduled for release some time in 1968 or 1969. A follow-up single, \\"Susannah's Still Alive\\", was released in November 1967. However, it only reached number 20 on Melody Maker.Chart Positions The release of the solo album was held back, and it was decided to wait and see how another single would fare. As anticipation grew for the release of the new LP, fans nicknamed it A Hole in the Sock Of. The name was based on a remark Ray Davies had made to a reporter during an interview about the title of Dave's forthcoming solo album and was, although meant ironically, taken seriously. The title was a send up possibly of the Beatles ambitious \\"A Day in the Life\\" or Traffic's \\"Hole In My Shoe\\". \\"Lincoln County\\" was chosen as the next single but failed to chart. With subsequent singles meeting the same result, a combination of Davies' own lack of interest in continuing and Pye's decision to stop killed off any hopes of an album.Google Books listing for Kink In a 1999 interview, Davies stated that: > I was quite surprised when management and the record company wanted me to > make an album. I thought it was quite daunting. There were a couple of tunes > I liked - 'Suzannah's Still Alive,' 'Lincoln County' - but it had to feel > right, and it didn't feel right. I did a few songs in a demo studio and I > knocked out three or four songs, and one of them was 'Creeping Jean,' and I > started to get very depressed about the whole idea. One of the last songs I > recorded then was 'I'm Crying,' so you can tell what frame of mind I was in. Recording and tracks Technically work began on the project after the unexpected success of \\"Death of a Clown\\". Initially, proposed material included blues numbers by Lead Belly and Big Bill Broonzy in addition to original material; ultimately, lack of both original material and interest delayed further work on an LP until the very end of 1968, when four new songs were recorded at Polydor Studios in London. Work was to have completed early in 1969 but was delayed at least partly when Dave Davies fractured a finger. Much of the unissued material seems to have been recorded in June 1969, just after completion of recordings for Arthur (with John Dalton, not Pete Quaife, on bass). Two titles (\\"This Man He Weeps Tonight\\" and \\"Mindless Child of Motherhood\\"), both released as B-sides of Kinks singles were recorded as part of the Arthur sessions, but ultimately not included on that LP's final track selection. Reprise files imply that Reprise received tapes of this album, under the title Lincoln County, in July 1969 while it was still considered for release by the band. By September of that year, the decision was made not to release the album. Throughout 1970, reports of a reworked version with new material were discussed; the possibility of issuing Dave's LP as the second half of a 2-LP set was raised, but by the close of that year all talk of the LP's release had ceased. Oddly, tapes of this LP were not officially logged into Reprise's official master tape log until 1972, as part of their contractual settlement after the Kinks moved to RCA. Short of the existence of this acetate in their vaults, there is no other indication that Reprise ever seriously considered this LP for release in its entirety. All songs were mixed (in the case of \\"Susannah's Still Alive\\", remixed) in stereo for this release.

She is widely considered to be a martyr and exemplar for Chinese and other Christians, like the Chinese church leader and teacher Watchman Nee.  Early life  Peng Lingzhao was born to a prominent family in Suzhou, Jiangsu province. By age 16, she had already joined an underground Communist cell and was writing articles criticizing the corruption of the Nationalist government under the pen name Lin Zhao. Three months before the Communists took power in mainland China, she ran away from home in order to attend a journalism school run by the Communists. During her tenure, she was assigned to work in a group to administer land reform in the countryside, where she took an active role in the torture and violent deaths of landlords as justified by the principle of class struggle.  Dissident  Lin later enrolled in the Chinese literature department at Peking University where she became an outspoken dissident during the Hundred Flowers Movement of 1957. During this time, intellectuals such as herself were encouraged to criticize the Communist Party of China, but were later punished for doing so.. As punishment, Lin was ordered to perform menial tasks for the university which included killing mosquitoes as part of the Four Pests Campaign and cataloguing old newspapers for the reference library of the university's journalism department. In October 1960 while on medical parole in Suzhou, Lin Zhao was arrested along with other dissidents for helping to publish an underground magazine that criticized the Communist Party in reaction to the devastation wrought on the Chinese people by the government during the Great Leap Forward. She was later sentenced to 20 years imprisonment as a political prisoner. where she was repeatedly beaten and tortured. Lin was a convert to Christianity, having attended a Christian missionary school before studying at Peking University. As she languished in prison, she became more committed to her faith in addition to increasing her criticism of the Communist Party of China. While in prison, Lin famously wrote hundreds of pages of critical commentary about Mao Zedong using hairpins and bamboo slivers with her own blood as ink. In a report dated December 5, 1966, it was recommended that Lin be executed based on \\"serious crimes\\" which included, \\"1. Insanely attacking, cursing, and slandering our great Chinese Communist Party and our great leader Chairman Mao... 2. Regarding the proletarian dictatorship and socialist system with extreme hostility and hatred... 3. Publicly shouting reactionary slogans, disrupting prison order, instigating other prisoners to rebel, and broadcasting threats to take revenge on behalf of executed counter- revolutionary criminals... 4. Persistently maintaining a reactionary stand, refusing to admit her crimes, resisting discipline and education, and defying reform...\\" Lin was executed by gunshot in 1968. Lin's family was not made aware of her death until a Communist Party official approached her mother to collect a five-cent bullet fee for the bullet used to kill her.  Rehabilitation  In 1981, under the government of Deng Xiaoping, Lin was officially exonerated of her crimes and rehabilitated. Despite her rehabilitation, the Chinese government remains reluctant to allow commemoration or discussion of Lin's life and writings. In 2013, on the 45th anniversary of Lin's execution, a number of activists attempted to visit Lin's grave near her hometown of Suzhou but were restricted by government security officials.  Legacy  The story of Lin Zhao's life was obscure and little- known until it was brought to light by documentary filmmaker Hu Jie, whose 2005 documentary In Search Of Lin Zhao's Soul won numerous awards. She is also featured in several chapters of Philip Pan's 2008 book, Out of Mao's Shadow. Many of her essays, letters, and diaries were preserved by Communist Party officials for possible future use as propaganda. Some time after her death, a police official agreed to risk his own life in order to smuggle many of Lin's writings to her friends and family. Hu Jie was able to acquire some of these writings for use in his documentary. Currently, a collection of her works is being held at the Hoover Institute at Stanford University. In 2018, Xi Lian, a professor of world Christianity at Duke University, published a biography of Lin Zhao based upon interviews with friends and family, surviving testimonials and letters from Lin. Five-Cent Life, an English-language biopic based on Lin Zhao's life, was released in 2020.

Although this genus was first mentioned by Alan Charig in 1956,Charig, A. J. (1956). New Triassic archosaurs from Tanganyika, including Mandasuchus and Teleocrater: Dissertation Abstracts. Cambridge University. a formal description was not published until 2018. History The name was first used in a 1956 doctoral dissertation by Alan J. Charig of the University of Cambridge, along with Teleocrater, an archosaur formally named in 2017. Several well preserved specimens have been found, although there is little cranial material. The family Prestosuchidae was erected in 1967 by Alfred Romer to include Mandasuchus and three other formally named genera of \\"rauisuchians\\". Charig and two coauthors suggested in a 1965 study dealing with saurischians that Mandasuchus was a possible ancestor of the \\"prosauropods\\" (basal sauropodomorphs), without explanation. In his 1993 study of the phylogeny of Crocodylotarsi (croc-line archosaurs, now known as Pseudosuchia), J. Michael Parrish argued that Mandasuchus was not a distinct genus. He proposed that it was in the same genus as the European archosaur Ticinosuchus ferox due to the similarity of some homologous postcranial bones, but withheld final taxonomic determination of Mandasuchus until Charig provided a published description of the material. However, Charig died in 1997 without publishing on many of the archosaurs he discovered. Mandasuchus was finally formally described in 2018 by Richard J. Butler and colleagues, as part of a multinational investigation into the fossils of Triassic rift systems in Tanzania and Zambia. A phylogenetic analysis recovered it as a loricatan more basal than Prestosuchus and not synonymous with Ticinosuchus, albeit not too distantly related either.  Description   Skull  Skull material for Mandasuchus is limited to maxillae and part of a dentary. The maxilla is low, with an elongated antorbital fenestra and at least 12 tooth sockets separated by discrete interdental plates. The antorbital fenestra is surrounded by an inset basin, the antorbital fossa, as with other archosaurs. However, Mandasuchus has a restricted and weakly differentiated antorbital fossa compared to other loricatans and Ticinosuchus. The ascending (or dorsal) process of the maxilla, which lies in front of the antorbital fenestra, is short and very thin. This process is also uniquely diagonally oriented when seen from above, with its rear edge set inwards from the front edge. The only preserved tooth is thin and serrated. The dentary fragment is incomplete, but seemingly slender and similar to the maxilla.  Postcrania  The centrum (main spool-shaped component) of Mandasuchus's longest cervical (neck) vertebrae are about 1.8 times longer than high. This is similar to Ticinosuchus and intermediate between other loricatans (which have shorter vertebrae) and poposauroids (which have longer vertebrae). Smaller specimens have slightly shorter cervical vertebrae. The lower edge and sides of the cervicals are concave while the rib facets (dia- and parapophyses) and articular processes (pre- and post-zygapophyses) are stout. A long ridge runs along the base of the neural spine while smaller ridges connect the articular processes to the front and rear edges of the neural spines, defining deep pockets in the process. The neural spines themselves are short and expanded at their upper extent to form \\"spine tables\\", with those near the shoulder resembling rearward-pointed teardrops when seen from above. Cervical ribs are thick and slightly contact each other. Dorsal (back) vertebrae are taller, wider, and their parapophyses gradually shift upwards, but dorsals are otherwise similar to the cervicals. Dorsal neural spines overhang the rear of their respective vertebrae and possess elliptical spine tables. The single known sacral (hip) vertebra is small, simple, and poorly preserved, but it seems to retain a small rear pocket. The caudal (tail) vertebrae gradually lengthen and simplify down the tail, they gain chevrons starting at the fifth caudal, and their neural spines gradually shorten. The neural spines have small spine tables, less distinct than those of the cervicals and dorsals. Osteoderms (bony plates) extended down the back in two rows which were \\"staggered\\". i.e. offset from each other so that the armor is asymmetrical. Individual osteoderms were short, thick, and overlapped the pointed front extent of succeeding osteoderms. The scapula expands towards its upper extremity (more so than Ticinosuchus) and has concave front and rear edges. A small muscle scar is present on the rear edge near the glenoid (shoulder socket), similar to one observed in Batrachotomus, albeit less distinct. The humerus is narrow and has prominent and well-developed muscle attachments, while the ulna is shorter and quite robust. The ilium is low and similar to that of Ticinosuchus, with muscle scars for two sacral ribs on its inner surface and no vertical ridge on its outer surface. The pubis is somewhat elongated, with its base forming part of the acetabulum and possessing a small perforation known as an obturator fenestra. The tip of the pubis slightly expands into a bulbous pubic boot resembling that of other basal loricatans. The ischium is only slightly shorter than the pubis and also possesses a three-dimensional expansion at its tip. Although the left and right ischia would have contact each other extensively like those of Ticinosuchus and paracrocodylomorphs, this contact was apparently weak enough that the bones were separated during fossilization. The femur has many archosaurian hallmarks near the hip, such as enlarged proximal tuberosities, a mound-like fourth trochanter, and possibly a groove on the upper surface of the femoral head. It also possessed a scar for the iliofemoralis muscle and a distinct oval pit on its rear edge, which is not known in other pseudosuchians. The tibia is straight and possesses typical pseudosuchian features, while the incomplete fibula has a knob-shaped iliofibularis scar in its upper half. Although no foot bones are preserved, Mandasuchus does have two well-preserved proximal tarsals (ankle bones): the astragalus and calcaneum. Mandasuchus has a \\"crocodile-normal\\" or \\"crurotarsal\\" ankle, with a prominent peg on the astragalus fitting into a shallower pit on the calcaneum. The ankle has many suchian features, including a flexed (albeit indistinct) tibial facet on the astragalus, and a wide, expanded calcaneal tuber offset from the calcaneum's contact with the fourth distal tarsal.

It is endemic to the Lake Van basin.Sari, 1997 The tarek is the 'jewel' of Lake Van in Turkey. Found nowhere else in the world, this fish thrives in the lake's salty and carbonated waters, which are inhospitable to other forms of fresh water and marine fish. In May and June of each year it travels upstream through the lake's tributaries to lay eggs, flying through the air like salmon. Many locals have become accustomed to sticking out bags and catching fish as they jump out of the water, catching so many fish in May‚ÄìJune that they do not have to fish for the rest of the year. Locals prefer to catch the fish during reproduction season, when the females are filled with eggs, which are considered a delicacy in the town and region of Erci≈ü. YY√ú and Doƒüa G√∂zc√ºleri Derneƒüi (www.incikefali.net) have been developing a conservation strategy since 1997 (Sari, 2012).

Robert Mesle (born 1950) is a process theologian and was professor of philosophy and religion at Graceland University in Lamoni, Iowa until his retirement in 2016. After earning a B.A. in religion at Graceland University (1972), an M.A. in Christian theology at University of Chicago Divinity School (1975), Mesle received a Ph.D. in philosophy and religion from Northwestern University (1980). Mesle is the author of Process Theology: A Basic Introduction. In this book he outlines three attributes of a process theology. There is a relational character to the divine such as: :*God experiences both the joy and suffering of humanity. :*God is not omnipotent in the classical sense :*God exercises relational power and not unilateral control. In Chapter 17, he formulates a process naturalism. As a naturalist his religious view is one without a divine being. There is only the finite world. His process naturalism shares with process theism recognition of the ambiguity of Existence. It also has virtually every value and ethical standard in common with process theism and religious in this respect. Consequently, Mesle is a religious naturalist.

During this earliest stage the mound was built as part of a defensive structure serving as the base for a fortress on its top. In the Iron Age, Tell el-Burak was home to a settlement that was prosperous and peaceful, as seen in its defenseless and fine architecture. There is no apparent occupation in the intervening Late Bronze Age as the site was seemingly abandoned in favor of Sarepta, four kilometers to the south. The tell stands prominently amidst agricultural lands on a strip of plain fronted by the Mediterranean Sea and backed by a range of hills. The plain, a well-watered zone, is home to a large agricultural area where fruit trees currently predominate. The conical purpose-built tell towers above the plain to some 19 meters and is readily visible from both land and sea. From the top of mound, Sidon can be seen to the north, and to the south rising above Ras el-Qantara, the tell of the Late Bronze Age/Phoenician city of Sarepta can be seen.

The document is dated 3 January 1356, (NS) and it is seen as the equivalent of Magna Carta for the Low Countries. Background Everard 't Serclaes monument in Brussels. 't Serclaes made the Joyous Entry possible by retaking Brussels from the Flemings. In 1354, Duke John III summoned representatives of the cities of the duchy to Leuven to announce the marriage of his oldest daughter and heiress Joanna to Wenceslaus I, Duke of Luxembourg, and offered them liberal concessions so as to secure their assent to the change of dynasty. John's death in 1355 sparked a succession crisis. In January 1356, Wenceslaus and Joanna signed the charter that had been drawn up and solemnly swore to uphold its provisions. Louis II, Count of Flanders, had married Joanna's younger sister Margaret and claimed Brabant in her right. Louis invaded Brabant and quickly seized Brussels. By August 1356, the Brabantian document was a dead letter in practice, owing to the military occupation of Brabant by Louis. During the night of 24 October 1356, a group of Brabantian patriots led by Everard 't Serclaes scaled the city walls and drove the Flemings from the city. This enabled Joanna and Wenceslaus to make their joyous entry into Brussels, giving the document its name. Content The charter had not been completely new. A custom of \\"landcharters\\" originating in Brabant during the previous century, had already produced the Charter of Kortenberg, granted by John II in 1312 and also considered a Brabantian Constitution, or the \\"Walloon Charter\\" of 1314. The six specific freedoms or \\"privileges\\" detailed powers granted to the church, the towns and some nobles, by means of which Duchess Joanna and Duke Wenceslaus could collect taxes. With the instrument, the dukes of Brabant undertook to maintain the indivisibility of the duchy, and not to wage war, make treaties, or impose taxes without the consent of their subjects, as represented by the municipalities. All members of the duke's council were to be native-born Brabanters. Aftermath On 5 April, Wenceslaus' half-brother Charles IV became Holy Roman Emperor; he presided at the Imperial Diet which decreed the Golden Bull of 1356, fixing an important aspect of the constitutional structure of the Holy Roman Empire, mainly restricting the freedoms of cities and civilians. The following February, when Charles, Joanna and Wenceslaus, and representatives of the Brabantian towns all met at Maastricht: to satisfy the Luxembourg dynasty it was officially denigrated by all parties, especially its chapter vii, which stipulated that the Duchess Joanna, if childless, should be succeeded by her natural heirs, her sisters. Thus, it was by abrogation of the Joyous Entry of 1356 that the Habsburgs eventually inherited Brabant. The defeat of Wenceslaus in 1371 was a victory for the towns over the feudal nobility, and in supporting Joanna's grandnephew Anthony of Burgundy as duke, the towns wrung from him a new constitution or Inauguration Charter (1406). What remained of the Joyous Entry charter would nevertheless be referred to for centuries.The Project Gutenberg EBook History of the United Netherlands, 1584 by John Lothrop Motley, released January, 2004 The Joyous Entry of 1356 has been viewed an equivalent to the rechtsstaat in the Low Countries or Magna Carta's establishment of a rule of law for England, the only other medieval document with claims to comprising a written basis of governance, in the other early successful example of a nation-state. In common with Magna Carta, its functioning significance was exaggerated by the Romantic historians of the 19th century.The Project Gutenberg EBook Rise of the Dutch Republic, 1560-61, by John Lothrop Motley'The metropolis and the state.

In the midst of the Eighty Years' War in the Low Countries, a book was repeatedly published (the 1578 edition safely from Cologne) with the Latin title Laetus introitus, with the view of reminding Philip II and his military commanders of the constitutional restraints of the Blijde Inkomst and giving heart to the insurgents in Brabant. Later, the ill-advised attempt of the 18th century Austrian Emperor Joseph II in his reforming zeal to abrogate the Joyous Entry caused a revolt in Brabant, before which he had to yield. This Joyous Entry charter was declared null and void when the Revolutionary French forces took possession of the Austrian Netherlands in 1794. Nevertheless, it became one of the elements that formed the Belgian Constitution of 1831.

Kukatja is closely related to Pintupi, spoken at Kintore and Kiwirrkura and many Mulan residents are closely related to people at those communities as well as at Balgo.  History  Mulan was established as a permanent Aboriginal community in the late 1970s by Walmajarri people moving away from the Balgo mission to the Lake Gregory Pastoral Station, near the shores of Lake Gregory. A major factor behind this was the transfer of the pastoral station from Lake Gregory Pty Ltd to the Aboriginal Land Trust in 1978. The community became incorporated in 1979 and the first houses and school were constructed in the same year. In 1985, Crown Reserve 39102 was excised from the pastoral lease and vested to the ALT for the \\"use and benefit of Aboriginal inhabitants\\", with the land being formally leased to Mulan Aboriginal Corporation the following year.

Taking the office above, he and partner John Mills had their start in London's club world. Their partnership ended with The Milroy Club and issues over Les Ambassadeurs. His first solo venture was the \\"La Rue\\", which later became The International Fine Arts Club, in Mayfair.

Noise-related phobia are common in dogs, and may be triggered by fireworks, thunderstorms, gunshots, and even bird noises. Associated stimuli may also come to trigger the symptoms of the phobia or anxiety, such as a change in barometric pressure being associated to a thunderstorm, thus causing an anticipatory anxiety. Signs of Dog Noise Anxiety Signs and symptoms of dog noise phobia may include: * Urinating or defecating * Hiding * Chewing * Panting * Pacing * Digging * Trying to jump out of windows or otherwise escape * Drooling * Seeking out the owner * Flatulence * Barking * Trembling * Dilated Pupils Milder symptoms may become exaggerated after repeated exposure to the phobia stimuli. The symptoms may present immediate physical danger to the dog, as in the case reported by Katherine A. Houpt, VMD, Ph.D., where a fleeing dog was hit by a vehicle. The progression of mild phobia to a significant one merits immediate treatment of any level of noise phobia. Common Problem Noises A variety of noises can provoke a dog's noise anxiety: * Thunderstorms * Fireworks * Vacuums * Construction Noises * Sirens * Gunshots * Noises from a Television Visuals, smells, and even barometric pressure or electrostatic changes can become associated with these noises progressively and then serve to further aggravate the condition. Treatment Options While it may not always be possible to remedy noise anxiety completely, effective management of the symptoms and associated dangers and discomforts are possible through a variety of treatments with varying effectiveness. Medications Commonly used medications include: * Diazepam * Clorazepate * Alprazolam * Amitriptyline * Clomipramine * Fluoxetine * Melatonex (Melatonin) * Selegiline Many of these medications are not specifically available in veterinary formulations but may still be prescribed by a veterinarian as an extra-label drug. Possible Negative Effects of Medication in Dogs Side-effects, drug interactions, and allergenic sensitivities are concerns when administering any medication to your dog. The Canine Liver Disease Foundation claims that many common drugs also can lead to liver damage in dogs, although they do not specifically cite any of the abovementioned drugs prescribed for dog anxiety. Some drugs may result in sedation or general mood alteration of a dog. The website for Clomicalm (Clomipramine Hydrochloride) states it does not alter a dog's personality or sedate it, but does list lethargy/depression, vomiting, diarrhea, and an elevation in liver enzymes as possible results. Pressure wraps Several \\"pressure wraps\\" or \\"body wraps\\" have appeared for sale to address the problem of dog noise anxiety. Dr. Donald Heagren, DVM, has cited the success one retail brand of pressure wrap, in regards to helping dogs deal with fireworks, while Dr. Shereen Farber, OTR, has similarly vouched for the successful functioning of another called The Anxiety Wrap. There are existing theories to explain the effectiveness of maintained body pressure in treating a dog's noise anxiety, although there are not yet any existing studies specifically examining this treatment in this specific context. The mechanism that allows pressure to treat other forms of anxiety in humans and other animals may be responsible for any successes. One example of successful treatment of anxiety through application of constant body pressure by a wrap is that of Temple Grandin's \\"Hug machine.\\" Temple Grandin, after seeing how cattle would calm down while being put into a squeeze chute to receive their shots, developed a machine based on the same principle to treat the anxiety resulting from her own autism. Her \\"hug machines\\" function by maintaining a constant pressure on the body, leading to a reduction in anxiety. Linda Tellington-Jones' \\"TTouch\\" technique, designed as a way of relaxing and training horses and eventually adapted to dogs as well, sometimes utilizes an ace bandage wrapped around the animal. Body wraps are also used to extend the benefits of the other aspects of the treatment. Training Different forms of training and behaviour modification may aid or, eventually, eliminate the symptoms or sources of dog noise anxiety. It is, however, important not to punish your dog if it is exhibiting symptoms of noise anxiety, as the punishment may increase the fear associated with the scenario. While it's been speculated that comforting your pet may reinforce their fearful behavior, this has been revealed to be a myth (Scientific source required, ref supplied is just opinion); the reality is that, while it does not directly help the animal in question, it also does not cause any apparent harm, nor does it perpetuate the problem.http://thebark.com/content/reducing-fear-your-dog Desensitization Desensitization involves the introduction and gradual increase of the anxiety-causing stimuli in order to reduce the dog's stress response. The dog is trained to be calm when confronted with low-volume recordings of the source of the fear, which are then incrementally increased, allowing the dog to maintain a calm that can extend to a full, normal experience of the noise. This training method is more successful in dogs than in cats, but still usually requires at least a weekly training session for the lifetime of the dog. Commercial CDs for the express purpose of dog noise desensitization are available. Counterconditioning Counterconditioning, in contrast to desensitization, attempts to condition the fear stimulus with positive associations. Treats, a favorite toy, activity, or a place, are presented prior and following a thunderstorm, for example. With repeated reinforcement, the dog should eventually come to associate the noise with the positive experience and be undaunted by future occurrences. Possible Advantages and Disadvantages of Training Training, in contrast to other remedies, often requires a large dedication of time at regular intervals. Some dogs may require the training routine to be extended for their entire lifetime to effectively manage the symptoms of noise anxiety. The use of trainers, also, may be prohibitive in cost. Finally, some dogs show little-to-no response from training of any duration In contrast, it is sometimes possible to train one's own dog without the hiring of a trainer or purchasing of products, and some dogs may respond very well to training. Furthermore, the danger of side effects as may be present with medication are not a concern. Exercise and Nutrition Vigorous exercise and nutrition may contribute to a reduction of noise anxiety, along with general stress. An increase in the amount of physical exertion on days where the fear-response is expected to occur can tire and relax the dog physically and mentally, as well as produce serotonin, which can act in the capacity of a natural sedative. High-protein diets have been linked to some behavioral problems in dogs. A consultation with a veterinarian may yield dietary advice able to play at least a small role in reduction of the dog's anxiety symptoms.  Sound therapy  Certain ambient noise, music or can be is played to calm and entertain dogs. It is may be used to relieve separation anxiety or noise phobia. Examples include the radio broadcasts by Classic FM on Fireworks Night and the podcasts and playlists produced by Spotify.

The movement has sometimes been referred to as \\"P&D;\\" or as The New Decorativeness. The movement was championed by the gallery owner Holly Solomon. The movement was the subject of a retrospective exhibition at the Hudson River Museum in 2008. Background and influences The Pattern and Decoration movement consisted of artists, many of whom had art education backgrounds, who had been involved with the abstract schools of art of the 1960s. The westernised, male dominated climate of artistic thought throughout Modernism had led to a marginalisation of what was considered non-Western and feminine. The P&D; movement wanted to revive an interest in minor forms such as patterning which at that point was equated with triviality. The prevailing negative view of decoration was one not generally shared by non-Western cultures. The Pattern and Decoration movement was influenced by sources outside of what was considered to be fine art. Blurring the line between art and design, many P&D; works mimic patterns like those on wallpapers, printed fabrics, and quilts. These artists also looked for inspiration outside of the United States. The influence of Islamic tile work from Spain and North Africa are visible in the geometric, floral patterns. They looked at Mexican, Roman, and Byzantine mosaics; Turkish embroidery, Japanese woodblocks; and Iranian and Indian carpets and miniatures. Development Although the source materials have a nostalgic appeal, the treatment of these sources is modernist. Ben Johnson describes the paintings thus: \\"Pattern and Decoration did not distinguish between background and foreground, nor did it emphasize specific aspects of the composition. Rather, much as the abstract paintings of the time, it covered the canvas from edge to edge in an all-encompassing design. At the outset of the movement, Pattern and Decoration artists reacted against the severe lines and restrained compositions of minimalism. Yet, they often retained the same 'flattening grid' frequently employed by Minimalist painters.\\"http://www.metrojacksonville.com/article/2012-jun-at-moca-refocus- on-the-70s-pattern-and-decoration Beyond painting Some work fitting into the P&D; movement could be considered applied art. P&D; artists worked in a variety of media beyond painting. One of Joyce Kozloff‚Äôs major early works was an installation called ‚ÄúAn Interior Decorated.‚Äù It included ceramics, a hand- painted-tile floor, silkscreened wall hangings, and lithographs. The piece was installed in the Tibor de Nagy Gallery in New York.http://www.joycekozloff.net/ In addition to his lush paintings and collages of flowers, Robert Kushner created ornate costumes that were used in performance events.http://www.robertkushnerstudio.com/ Many P&D; created collages by decontextualizing and recombining disparate elements to form new meanings. Miriam Schapiro invented the term \\"femmage\\" to describe a combination of painting and sewing techniques. She embellished the painted canvas with traditionally female work such as embroidery, cross-stitch, and quilting.(http://www.albany.edu/museum/wwwmuseum/crossing/artist25.htm) Aside from physical assemblages, artists borrowed snippets from other cultures and sources; therefore collage was crucial to the movement‚Äôs concept. Critics like Anne Swartz use this recombination of source materials as evidence that the Pattern and Decoration movement is an early example of postmodernism. Critical debate The P&D; artists enjoyed a period of critical and financial success; their works were much sought-after and widely collected in both America and Europe. From the 1980s on, however, it was largely dismissed by critics. The reason for the backlash are multifarious and open to debate. NYT critic Holland Cotter offers the following explanation: \\"Art associated with feminism has always had a hostile press. And there was the beauty thing. In the neo-Expressionist, neo-Conceptualist late 1980s, no one knew what to make of hearts, Turkish flowers, wallpaper and arabesques.\\" In 2008 the Hudson River Art Museum in Yonkers, NY arranged a major exhibition entitled ‚ÄúPattern and Decoration: An Ideal Vision in American Art, 1975-1985,\\" which sought to reestablish its reputation as a serious movement. Curator Anne Swartz asserts that at the time audiences were uncomfortable with the unapologetic sensuality: ‚ÄúI suspect that until recently, a certain Puritanism surrounded the view of feminist art that prevented it from being seen as acceptable when it was sexually exciting and provocative. So when P&D; art utilized some of the mechanisms of feminist art (provocation, pleasure, softness, etc) it challenged the intellectual systems that were supposed to be uppermost in the viewer‚Äôs mind.‚Äù There was a renaissance of interest and critical attention as result of the fresh scholarship. Cotter goes on to explain why the contemporary climate is more able to understand and appreciate the movement: \\"Thanks to multiculturalism and identity politics, we know better what to make of them now; the art world‚Äôs horizons are immeasurably wider than they were two decades ago.\\" Relation to the feminist art movement There is a close connection between the Pattern and Decoration movement and the feminist art movement. The P&D; movement arose in opposition to the Minimalist and Conceptualist movements, which valued austerity and demeaned ornamentation and craft. In their widely anthologized 1978 essay \\"Art Hysterical Notions of Progress and Culture,\\" P&D; artists Joyce Kozloff and Valerie Jaudon explained how they thought sexist and racist assumptions underlaid Western art history discourse. They reasserted the value of ornamentation and aesthetic beauty - qualities assigned to the feminine sphere.Stiles, Kristine and Peter Selz (1996). Theories and Document of Contemporary Art: A Sourcebook of Artists' Writings. Berkeley and Los Angeles California: University of California Press. . pp. 154‚Äì155 Floral imagery, patterning, and decoration are associated with the feminine. P&D; artists included elements of crafts such as needlepoint and beading, which were traditionally done by women within the domestic sphere. By including these elements in their work, they dismantle the hierarchy of fine art over craft, and thereby raise questions about public (male) verses domestic (female) spaces, and fine art versus utiltarian objects.Balducci, Temma. \\"The Elephant in the Room: Pattern and Decoration, Feminism, Aesthetics, and Politics\\" in Pattern and Decoration: An Ideal Vision in American Art, 1975-1985. Ed. Anne Swartz. Yonkers: Hudson River Museum, 2007. However, critics argue about to what extent the P&D; movement can be considered feminist. Although Kozloff and Jaudon were explicit about their feminist agenda, male artists Robert Kushner (artist) and Kim MacConnel sometimes avoided the label.Balducci, Temma. ‚ÄúThe Elephant in the Room: Pattern and Decoration, Feminism, Aesthetics, and Politics‚Äù in Pattern and Decoration: An Ideal Vision in American Art, 1975-1985. Ed. Anne Swartz. Yonkers: Hudson River Museum, 2007. They were more vocal about their aesthetic motivation for pursuing decoration. Writes Kushner: \\"For gallery and museum acceptance, if the art was industrial-looking, rectangular, and gray, black, or white, it was shown... Everything else (except color field painting, which today can be viewed as Technicolor minimalism) seemed to be marginalized. This simply did not fit many of our temperaments. Gray was boring. We wanted our art to be a lasting experience that took a great deal of time to decode fully.\\"Joyce Kozloff and Robert Kushner. ‚ÄúPattern, Decoration and Tony Robbin.‚Äù Artcritical. August 2nd, 2011, http://www.artcritical.com/2011/08/02/tony-robbin/. Since these male artists both helped to define the P&D; movement and were commercially successful,Jenni Sorkin. ‚ÄúKim MacConnel.‚Äù Frieze.

The committee submitted its report on 30 June 1915.Britain's War Aims in the Middle East in 1915, Aaron S.

Report The De Bunsen committee considered four possible solutions: (1) partition, leaving only a small Ottoman state in Anatolia; (2) preservation subject to Great Power control zones of political and commercial influence; (3) preservation as an independent state in Asia; (4) creation of a decentralised, federal Ottoman state in Asia. The Committee's report, titled \\"Committee of Imperial Defence: Asiatic Turkey, Report of a Committee\\" was issued on 30 June 1915,National Archives, CAB 42/3/12 and recommended the last option as the best solution for meeting the British Empire's defence needs.

He converted King Bir Hambir to Vaishnava. His daughter, Hemalata Thakurani, was also a guru. Srinivas Acharya is a Parsada. He is the abhinna kalevara or identical body of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. It is believed that Sri Chaitanya carried out his works of spreading the message of Vaishnavaism through Sri Srinivas Acharya. He was invited to come in this world personally by Lord Chaitanya. There were two expansions of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu: The first expansion are the six Goswamis, who He entrusted to discover Vrindavan, to establish the holy worship of the Lord's deity and to give the bhakti-grantha, the Holy scriptures to protect the bhakti path. The secondary expansion of His mission came through Srinivas Acharya, Narottam das Thakur and Syamananda prabhu, who were particularly responsible for preaching the message of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu throughout India. They formed the great spiritual sankirtan party. Srinivas Acharya was in the forefront of the Vaishnava movement and was responsible for the propagation of Krishna Bhakti marg across the plains of India. The story of the appearance of Srinivas Acharya His father was called Chaitanya Das. Previously he had another name, but when he went to Katwa, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was at the verge of taking Sannyasa. As he came there the barber was just applying his razor to cut the hair of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. That sight was so unbearable for him, that finally when he heard the sannyasa name that was given to Mahaprabhu, he could only utter: \\"Chaitanya, Chaitanya, Chaitanya\\". Seeing this the people reasoned: \\"Let's call him Chaitanya Das, as the only things he says, is 'Chaitanya , Chaitanya'. That will be an appropriate name for him.\\" In this way he received his new name. Chaitanya Das was married and on one occasion his wife addressed him: \\"My dear husband, I had a dream; Lord Chaitanya appeared to me, ordering us to have a child.\\" And Chaitanya Das said: \\"What? You are even using Lord Chaitanya for having a child? That is not proper.\\" \\"No\\", she said: \\"I promise you, I am not speaking any lie. Mahaprabhu came to me in a dream and he told me that he wanted us to have a child. Chaitanya Das replied: \\"That is not enough for me. We have to go to Puri and confirm that order, since Mahaprabhu is there. And if He wants us to do this special service there is also a good opportunity He will grant us His darshan.\\" Chaitanya Mahaprabhu after taking Sannyasa went to Puri. They decided to go and as they were living in the Nabadwip area, Chaitanya Das and his wife started on their pilgrimage to Puri. When they reached Puri, Mahaprabhu was coming down the main road in front of the Jagannath Temple with his sankirtana party. He was surrounded by many sannyasis and followers. As soon as Mahaprabhu noticed them approaching, He made the crowd open up, welcomed them and invited them to come and see Him later. All the sannyasis were surprised: \\"Who is this grihasta ? Mahaprabhu is giving special attention to him. How is that possible?\\" They were all curious. This story is described in Bhakti Ratnakara, by Narahari Chakraborty Thakur. Chaitanya Das and his wife went to the Gambhira and there they met Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. They spoke for a while with Him and finally Mahaprabhu told them: \\"Chaitanya Das, your wife is right. I want you to have a child and I want you to call that child Srinivas.\\" It was an announcement by Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu inviting a dear devotee of His into a very special family of His personal associates, and practically unheard of in the history of transcendence, a child is announced directly by the Supreme personality of Godhead. They were very happy hearing this service which Chaitanya Mahaprabhu personally gave to them. It was unique. They remained for a few days in Jagannath Puri, joining the sankirtan of Mahaprabhu and filling their hearts with joy. Then they went back to Nabadwip. Shortly thereafter they had this wonderful child ‚Äì very auspiciously manifested. What could be more auspicious than his appearance heralded by the Lord Himself? Srinivas Acharya was born and description is given of the family life of Chaitanya Das. It is said, when Srinivas was only four years old, once he went into the temple-room of their house and he saw his father weeping there. The little boy asked: \\"Father, why are you crying?\\" Chaitanya Das replied: \\" Oh, because I have no love for Radha and Krishna, and no love for Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. I am in such a fallen condition.\\" When the little boy saw his father crying and heard his explanations, he also started crying, grabbing the feet of his father he said: \\" What can I say? I also have nothing of that what you are talking about.\\" Finally both of them were sitting in the temple room crying. Hearing that sound, the mother came, wanting to see what was happening in the temple room. Seeing husband and child sobbing in despair, she inquired for the reason. Chaitanya das said: \\"We have no love for Krishna, we have no love for Radharani.\\" So immediately she also fell on the ground and started crying too. There they were on floor of the temple - crying in wretchedness. When Srinivas was about eight or ten years old, one sannyasi visited. As it is a custom when a sannyasi comes to a home, he will be very happily received and treated with all honors. The sannyasi delivered Krishna katha and everybody was delighted. Then Chaitanya Das told to him: \\" My dear Sannyasi , you are a great preacher. Can I do you any favor? Is there anything you need?\\" The sannyasi said: \\"No, my dear Chaitanya Das, what I want, I will not tell you.\\" Chaitanya Das said: \\"What you mean, you will not tell me? You can not say this! I am a grihasta and I have my vows and I will treat the sannyasis properly. Please do not hesitate, if you need something special, tell me!\\" \\"No!\\", said the sannyasi: \\"I will not tell you. I can not tell you. You will not like that.\\" Hearing this Chaitanya Das became even more eager to serve the sannyasi, insisting: \\"You must tell me. I will not let you leave here. Anything that you ask, I will give to you.\\" Finally the sannyasi revealed his mind: \\"All right, yes, I want to take your son, Srinivas with me.\\" Chaitanya Das immediately fell over and lost consciousness. This is because he knew, after all this introduction, he could not withdraw his promise. It was too much. The gift was given and now it was taken back. Srinivas Acharya was taken away by this Sannyasi and then his transcendental career started. He came to Vrindavan and he became a disciple of Gopal Bhatta Goswami. Gopal Bhatta Goswami became his diksha guru. This was all arranged by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu personally and then even though he became initiated by Gopal Bhatta Goswami, he was sent for spiritual studies to Radha Damodar Mandir, to Srila Jibha Goswami Prabhupada so he could learn the Vhaisnava philosophy there. Srinivas Acharya Thakur lived in Sripat Jajigram in West Bengal with his two wives, Isvari and Srimati. One day while Srinivas was sitting for japa and meditation on Vraja lila, he entered into deep samadhi. It was not unusual for him to remain so absorbed for hours, but this time night came and went and still his samadhi did not break. Dawn flowed into midday, midday into dusk, but still Srinivas remained sitting on his asana, his mind turned inwards, unaware of the outside world. Srimati and Isvari were distressed to see their husband in this state. When another night came and he still showed no sign of consciousness, Srimati and Isvari called for Srinivasa's dearest disciple, Ramachandra Kaviraj. Ramachandra came and they told him, ‚ÄúRam! Your Gurudev has been sitting in meditation for two days. He has not eaten anything, and his breathing is very slow. We are afraid he might die!‚Äù Ramachandra said, ‚ÄúO my dear mothers! I will find out what‚Äôs the matter. Don‚Äôt worry, everything will be alright.‚Äù Ramachandra sat near his Gurudeva and began to meditate. Soon he became completely immersed in Vraja Lila, and saw himself in his svarupa as ‚ÄúKaruna-manjari.‚Äù ...‚ÄùKaruna manjari‚Äù found herself in the midst of a grove of trees and flowering vines, and heard the sounds of Radharani's sakhis laughing with Krishna. Following the sounds of their laughter, she made her way to the bank of Sri Radhakunda. There she saw two or three manjaris standing far away from Radha and Krishna and the sakhis, looking with distress towards the water of the kunda. One of them explained, ‚ÄúRadharani has lost her favorite nose ring during jala-keli! We must get it back. See, your sakhi is searching for it now.‚Äù Karuna-manjari saw her guru-rupa-sakhi, Mani Manjari (Srinivas Acharya Thakur) diving again and again into the waters of Radhakunda in search of the missing nose ring. Karuna-manjari dove into the water and joined in the search. Within half an hour, she found Radharani's nose ring and gave it to Mani Manjari. Mani Manjari was overjoyed to find the nosering at last. She gave the nosering to Rupa Manjari, who placed it in the nose of Radharani. Rupa Manjari said to Mani-manjari, ‚ÄúRadharani is so pleased with your seva, she secretly gave me her chewed tambul for you. Take it.‚Äù Mani-manjari took a little of Radharani's prasadi tambul and gave the rest to Karuna-manjari. Now that the nose ring was found, both Srinivasacharya and Ramachandra Kaviraj returned to external consciousness. Meanwhile, a third day had come and gone. Srimati and Isvari were weeping bitterly, when Srinivas and Ramachandra finally came to. Srimati and Isvari immediately made arrangements for their prasada, as Srinivas had not eaten for three days, and bade him take rest. The next morning Srimati and Isvari inquired of Ramachandra Kaviraj, ‚ÄúWhat happened? How has our husband ended up in such a condition? Please tell us everything!‚Äù Ramachandra told Srinivasa's wives the story of Radharani's lost nose ring, and they listened with rapt attention. ‚ÄúSo you see, o mothers, that is why Gurudeva remained in meditation for three days ‚Äî he had to complete his seva for Radharani.‚Äù The descendants of Hemalata Thakurani presently reside in Vrindaban district of Uttar Pradesh.They are known by the Brahmin title of Chattaraj.

Konstantios was the son of Emperor Constantine X Doukas and Empress Eudokia Makrembolitissa. Upon his birth, he was elevated to junior emperor, along with his brother Michael VII. He remained as junior emperor during the reigns of Constantine, Romanos IV Diogenes, and Michael VII, before he became senior emperor on 31 March 1078, due to the abdication of Michael VII. He was soon handed over to Nikephoros III, a usurper, due to his inability to rule. He was sent to live in a monastery, where he stayed until recalled by Alexios I Komnenos, who made him a general. He was killed on 18 October 1081, in the Battle of Dyrrhachium. Life Konstantios Doukas was born in 1060, the son of Emperor Constantine X and Empress Eudokia Makrembolitissa. He was born during Constantine's reign; because of this, he was porphyrogennetos. His father Constantine became emperor on November 24, 1059, after Isaac I Komnenos selected him as his heir, shortly before Isaac abdicated. In 1060, Constantine elevated both Michael VII and Konstantios to junior emperors under him, but did not elevate his middle son Andronikos Doukas to junior emperor, for unknown reasons. Konstantios retained his title of junior emperor during the reigns of Constantine (1060‚Äì1067), Romanos IV Diogenes (1068‚Äì1071), and Michael VII (1071‚Äì1078). Konstantios was engaged to Anna Vsevolodovna of Kiev in 1074. Michael VII abdicated on 31 March 1078, due to severe unpopularity and the two active revolts against him by Nikephoros III and Nikephoros Bryennios, retiring to the Monastery of Stoudios. Michael VII chose Konstantios to succeed him, as Andronikos had died a few years before this. Konstantios only had to contend with Nikephoros III, as Nikephoros Bryennios had been defeated by Nikephoros III at the Battle of Kalavrye, and subsequently blinded by him. Konstantios rapidly lost support, as it became clear he had no skill as a ruler. In the same year, his own supporters handed him over to Nikephoros III, who sent him to be tonsured and live in a monastery on one of the Princes Islands in the Propontis, as a monk. By becoming a monk he became unable to marry, and thus his engagement to Anna Vsevolodovna of Kiev was cancelled. He was recalled by Alexios I Komnenos, who succeeded Nikephoros, and who was related to Konstantios by way of his marriage to Irene Doukaina, in 1081. He was made a general, and sent to campaign against the Normans. After Alexios seized the throne, he elevated Constantine Doukas to co-emperor. Konstantios fought in the Battle of Dyrrhachium on 18 October 1081, where Byzantine forces besieging Dyrrachium were engaged by Norman forces. Although the Byzantines were initially successful, with the Norman right wing being routed by the Byzantine left wing, the Norman center routed the central forces of the Byzantines. During this engagement, the Varangian Guard, which whom Konstantinos was fighting, was separated from the core body of the Byzantine army and massacred. Konstantinos himself perished in the combat. In media Konstantios Doukas is thought to be engraved on the Holy Crown of Hungary, which was given to Hungarian King G√©za I of Hungary by Konstantios' brother Michael VII, depicted alongside King Geza I and Michael VII; although the figure may actually be Constantine Doukas.

He was a long- time civil servant in the Treasury Department, and was not a professional architect.

He was the EO, which put him in charge of all non-technical operations of the office, under Taylor, and then under his successor Oscar Wenderoth who took over in 1912. For a period in 1912 after the resignation of Taylor, Wetmore was acting Supervising Architect until Wenderoth relocated to Washington. Wenderoth resigned in April 1915 to return to private practice in a firm that specialized in designing bank interiors. Following Wenderoth's departure in 1915, Wetmore was named as the Acting Supervising Architect. He held this position for almost twenty years, until his retirement in 1933. He initially believed the position would be temporary until an architect was selected to be the Supervising Architect. However, he had a thorough understanding of the operation of the office and worked well with its architects which accounted for his remaining in the position. Although outsiders did not always understand why a lawyer was running the office, the duties were primarily administrative; supervising architects did not require him to be trained as one. During much of his tenure, Louis A. Simon was responsible for the direction of much of the actual design work. Simon eventually succeeded Wetmore as head of the office. Wetmore was interested in architecture, and influenced government building design by promoting standardization. In collaboration with William Gibbs McAdoo, the Secretary of the Treasury from 1913‚Äì1918, buildings were to be designed with \\"scale, materials and finishes\\" that directly reflected their \\"location, prominence and income\\". This push to standardization of public building design was in conflict with the Tarsney Act, which permitted private architects to design federal buildings after being selected in a competition under the supervision of the Supervising Architect. The act, under which several Taylor-era buildings were designed, was repealed in 1913 as it was felt that designing buildings with government architects would most efficiently cause the desired standardization. As Supervising Architect, he often spoke to the Society of Constructors of Federal Buildings. He addressed the 1917 annual convention by reporting that \\"The Treasury Department completed plans and contracts for a public building every four days and each building has averaged a cost of $50,000.\\" He also noted that almost 90% of these were post offices. McAdoo Classification Buildings were to be designed with specific criteria. A \\"Class A\\" building was one that was on a major street of a major city, surrounded by expensive buildings, and expected to generate at least $800,000 in revenue. These buildings would have marble or granite exteriors, marble interiors, ornamental bronze, and other similar fixtures. A small post office with revenue of under $15,000 would be made of brick, with standard wood windows and doors and would appear \\"ordinary\\". Critics felt the system would make public buildings too plain. World War I During World War I, much of the work of the office stopped due to the priorities of the war. Construction was postponed except for the completion of building already under construction, and of new facilities such as hospitals, quarantine and immigration stations that aided the war effort. At McAdoo's direction, Wetmore tried to keep the staff together but many were lost to the armed forces and other agencies.. Post- war era Construction resumed, although costs had escalated and buildings could not be constructed at the costs estimated before the war. Work did proceed and the demand for new buildings increased. Wetmore was now serving under a new Treasury Secretary, Andrew W. Mellon. Mellon, who like Wetmore, was personally interested in architecture, kept Wetmore in his \\"acting\\" position because he \\"had been ably performing the duties for several years\\". Wetmore continued to advocate the use of government architects, in opposition to private architects who wanted to be able to work on federal projects. He said the use of private architects was appropriate \\"only in exceptional cases.\\" Federal Real Estate Board Wetmore was also named the chairman (Surveyor General of Real Estate) of the Federal Real Estate Board after its creation in 1922. The board was created to manage the government's vast real estate holdings and reduce expenses. Legacy and honors Wetmore's name is inscribed on the cornerstones of approximately 2000 federal buildings that were designed during his tenure that spanned the administrations of Wilson, Harding, Coolidge, Hoover, and into Franklin Roosevelt's. Time magazine said his name appeared more than that of any other US citizen. At his insistence, since he was not an architect, his title, both in usage and as inscribed, was always \\"Acting\\" Supervising Architect out of respect for the work of architects. He was most proud of the cornerstone of the post office built in 1931 in his birthplace of Bath, New York. He laid this cornerstone himself and retained the engraved trowel as a souvenir. Some of the buildings where his name can be found are: * United States Court House (Des Moines, Iowa), 1928 * Federal Building and United States Courthouse (Albuquerque, New Mexico), 1930 * U.S. Post Office and Courthouse (Baltimore, Maryland), 1930 * Alaska State Capitol, Juneau, Alaska, 1931 * U.S. Post Office (Medina, New York), 1931‚Äì1932 * Clarkson S. Fisher Federal Building and United States Courthouse, Trenton, New Jersey, 1932 * Las Vegas Post Office and Courthouse, Las Vegas, Nevada, 1933 During World War II the Liberty ship was built in Brunswick, Georgia, and named in his honor. Personal life He married Harriet Blye around 1883; she died before his retirement. They had two children, a daughter Viola and a son William. During his career with the government, he lived in both Takoma Park, Maryland and Washington. After his retirement, he moved to Coral Gables, Florida in 1934 with his second wife, Anna Polk Wetmore, where he died in 1940. Wetmore was an officer in the Masonic organization and attained its highest rank, a 33rd-degree Mason.

The duplication was first described as a case study in 1996. In 2000, the first study of the disease was released, and in 2007, enough patients had been gathered to complete a comprehensive study and give it a detailed clinical description. PTLS is named for two researchers involved in the latter phases, Drs. Lorraine Potocki and James R. Lupski of Baylor College of Medicine. PTLS was the first predicted reciprocal of a homologous recombination (microdeletion or microduplication) where both reciprocal recombinations result in a contiguous gene syndrome. Its reciprocal disease is Smith‚ÄìMagenis syndrome (SMS), in which the chromosome portion duplicated in PTLS is deleted altogether. Potocki‚ÄìLupski syndrome is considered a rare disease, predicted to appear in at least 1 in 20,000 humans. Symptoms of the syndrome include intellectual disability, autism, and other disorders unrelated to the listed symptoms.  Presentation  Clinically, PTLS presents as a milder syndrome than SMS, with distinct characteristics, though PTLS can be mistaken for SMS. Both syndromes are characterized by multiple congenital abnormalities and intellectual disability. A key feature which appears in 80% of cases is autism spectrum disorder. Other unique features of Potocki‚ÄìLupski syndrome include infantile hypotonia, sleep apnea, structural cardiovascular anomalies, cognitive deficits, abnormal social behaviors, learning disabilities, attention-deficit disorder, obsessive-compulsive behaviours, malocclusions, short stature and failure to thrive. After noting that autism is commonly associated with PTLS, researchers at the Centro de Estudios Cient√≠ficos and the Austral University of Chile genetically engineered a PTLS \\"model mouse\\" where the syntenic chromosome segment was duplicated, and examined the social behaviours of these mice versus those without the anomaly (the \\"wild-type\\"). One human autism-related symptom is abnormal reciprocal social interaction. The researchers observed that the genetically-engineered mice of both sexes had a slight (statistically insignificant) impairment of their preference of a social target (i.e., a living, breathing mouse) over an inanimate one ‚Äî the average human will prefer the social target ‚Äî and preferred to explore newly introduced mice instead of familiar ones, unlike the typical human and mouse preference of a friend over a stranger, demonstrating a change in their liking of social novelty. They also found that male mice, in some scenarios, showed increased anxiety and dominant behaviour than the control group. Anatomically, the engineered mice had a decreased brain-to-body mass ratio and an alteration in the expression of several genes in the hippocampus.  Molecular genetics  Both Potocki‚ÄìLupski and Smith‚ÄìMagenis syndromes arise through a faulty non-allelic homologous recombination mechanism. Both appear to involve a 1.3-3.7Mb chromosome section in 17p11.2 that includes the retinoic acid inducible 1 (RAI1) gene. Other candidate genes have been identified within the duplicated section, including SREBF1, DRG2, LLGL1, SHMT1 and ZFP179. In mice of the subfamily Murinae, a 32-34cM region of chromosome 11 is syntenic to 17p11.2, meaning that they contain the same genes in the same order and orientation. This conserved sequence has been exploited to learn more about SMS and PTLS. Through genetic studies on both laboratory mice and humans, it has been discovered that RAI1 is likely the gene responsible for these syndromes. For example, in one study, it was shown that mice with 2 copies of the RAI1 gene and 3 copies of each of the other 18 genes in the described translocated region of chromosome 11 appeared and behaved like the control mice with the described region intact. In other words, RAI1 is dosage-sensitive. This provides evidence that it is the number of RAI1 copies present that affects the symptoms of PTLS and SMS. It is therefore believed that RAI1 is the critical gene involved in these disorders; however, since no cases of RAI1 duplication alone have been identified, this has not been concluded. One group has noted that, in a mouse model, the flanking genes in the duplicated segment were also overexpressed, suggesting some new candidates for analysis, including MFAP4, TTC19 and GJA12.  Diagnosis  The duplication involved in PTLS is usually large enough to be detected through G-banding alone, though there is a high false negative rate. To ascertain the diagnosis when karyotyping results are unclear or negative, more sophisticated techniques such as subtelomeric fluorescent in-situ hybridization analysis and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) may be used.

It was the first original film that premiered on the network. Plot Teenage brothers 18-year-old Nick and 14-year-old Tyler come across a UFO that lands right in front of them on an empty road near their town. Soon after evading the government, mainly agent Armstrong, as well as keeping the UFO in seclusion, Tyler goes through dramatic physical changes and gains superhuman powers due to his dramatic trip into space via the UFO, including enhanced strength and telepathy, and becomes almost as tall as Nick. The situation becomes even more difficult to cover up considering Tyler is being constantly blown off by Nick, due to Nick's efforts at chasing Julie Gunn, as well as Nick having to make a science project to graduate high school and reptile-like aliens that have begun to appear and pursue Tyler. After having literally no one left to turn to, Tyler decides to tell agent Armstrong about the UFO. After agent Armstrong explains to Tyler about the effects that his trip into space had on his body, he shoots the ship with a laser gun, thereby critically damaging it, before he reveals himself to Tyler as a reptile-like alien in disguise and captures him. Nick, feeling guilty for constantly doubting and ignoring Tyler, goes to the UFO hideout to try to apologize, but upon finding that Tyler is missing and the is UFO damaged, he begins an attempt to repair the UFO, which has biological parts. After trying all night, he is successful and the UFO takes him to the hidden underground fortress in which the aliens are residing and realizes that it is actually an impact crater from the aliens' crash-landing on Earth. Nick locates Tyler and helps him escape from his holding cell. The brothers uncover that the aliens are planning to take over Earth by polluting the atmosphere. Tyler uses an alien explosive from the UFO to destroy the aliens and their pollution equipment and escape in the UFO. However, they do not succeed in destroying all of them and are chased by a surviving alien in a more powerful version of their UFO. After destroying the alien fighter and its pilot in a high speed, fast-paced dogfight, the UFO crashes at Nick's high school graduation. Nick then uses his fixing of the UFO as his science project, and is allowed to graduate. Nick wins Julie over and they kiss, Tyler gets a date with Katie Wallace and they get to keep the UFO. Assuming that all of the aliens were destroyed, the boys go on with their lives. However, at the end of the movie while taking the UFO for a joy-ride (With its new stereo system that Nick installed which is notably blasting the theme song of the movie, Low Day by Capra), four agent Armstrongs are seen watching them, revealing at least four of the aliens survived and are plotting another attack on them and the human race, thus leaving the possibility of a sequel.

Football career Small was born at South Bank, Middlesbrough and attended St. Peter's School, South Bank. He started his football career with Craghead United, playing in the Chester-le-Street & District League, before joining Sunderland of the Football League First Division in August 1912. Small spent most of his time at Roker Park in the reserves and his only first-team appearance for Sunderland came in a 3‚Äì1 victory at Manchester United on 15 March 1913. In August 1913, he moved to the south coast to join Southampton of the Southern League. He made his debut for the \\"Saints\\" in the opening match of the 1913‚Äì14 season, a 1‚Äì0 defeat at Brighton. Small soon became a popular player at The Dell who was \\"admired not only by the crowd but also by his colleagues\\". He was \\"the sort of player whose influence on team spirit was always positive (who) relished a challenge and his sturdy half-back play was an inspiration\\". He retained his place at right-half for the first twelve matches of the season until, after a run of four defeats, he lost his place to John Denby. Small returned to the side in February replacing George Hadley and kept his place for the rest of the season. Small started the following season at right-half until November when he moved to right-back to replace George Green until Green's return in March. By the end of the season, England was at war and normal football was suspended. Small played in six wartime fixtures, until joining the R.A.M.C. at the end of 1915. Later career Small spent sixteen months serving with the R.A.M.C. in Salonika before injuries caused him to be invalided back to Southampton, where he suffered a serious bout of malaria. After the war, he was a member of the Thornycrofts team which took First Division Burnley to a replay in the FA Cup first round, where they were defeated 5‚Äì0 after a scoreless draw at The Dell. He then spent a few months back in the Southern League with Mid Rhondda, before retiring from professional football in December 1920 and taking up employment with Harland & Wolff.

The film features the original 1872 Mussorgsky's score, although with significant cuts. Plot Saint- Petersburg, 1874. Composer Modest Mussorgsky is present at the premiere of his opera Boris Godunov. The curtain opens and the performance begins. After the death of Czar Fyodor an enormous crowd has gathered before the Kremlin gate. Incited by boyars, the crowd implores Boris Godunov to accept the throne. Boris agrees though he knows that the crown is stained with the blood of Czarevitch Dimitri, the rightful heir to the throne, murdered earlier at Godunov's secret order. At the same time, in a monastery, monk Pimen is finishing his historical chronicle. Asked by the young novice Grigori about Dimitri's mysterious death, Pimen reveals to him the truth about Godunov's involvement. Deeply affected by the monk's tale, Grigori soon flees to Lithuania. In the Kremlin, Godunov feels increasingly lonely as he is haunted by the visions of the murdered czarevitch. Prince Shuysky informs him that someone who claims to be Czarevitch Dimitri is heading for Moscow to take over the throne. In fact, this is the escaped novice Grigori who has become an impostor in order to win the heart of the Polish beauty Marina Mniszech‚Ä¶ Cast * Ruggero Raimondi as Boris Godunov * Kenneth Riegel as Prince Chouisky * Pavel Slaby as Grigory/Dimitri‚ÄîThe Innocent * Bernard Lefort/Paul Plishka as Pimene * Delphine Forest/Galina Vishnevskaya as Marina Mnichek * Romuald Tesarowicz as Varlaam, the hermit * Washington Symphony Orchestra (conducted by Mstislav Rostropovich) Production The film is based on the musical recording of Mussorgsky's opera made in the summer of 1987 in Washington, DC with the participation of several opera stars and the National Symphony Orchestra conducted by Mstislav Rostropovich. The recording was made for Erato Records and cost one million dollars. Producer Daniel Toscan du Plantier invited Andrzej Wajda to do the film version for Erato Films, and when the latter backed out, offered the project to Zulawski. The 7-million- dollar production was filmed in Yugoslavia in February-April 1989. Of the original performers only Ruggero Raimondi, Kenneth Riegel and Romuald Tesarowicz reprised their roles on screen, the rest of singers was replaced by non-singing actors. Zulawski chose to present the opera as a theatrical performance within the film. However, the director took this approach much further as the camera not only goes through the sets but also regularly exposes the film crew. Zulawski used only less than two hours of the three and a half recorded by Rostropovich, changed the sequence of some scenes and filled the picture with deliberate anachronistic references to the Soviet totalitarian regime. Controversy The liberties taken by the director outraged some opera purists and, first of all, the conductor Rostropovich. The latter sued Zulawski demanding to remove certain visual and sound elements from the film. On January 10, 1990, the Paris Court issued a verdict ordering Zulawski to insert an announcement in the beginning of the film, mentioning Rostropovich's disapproval of the film version. However, the court confirmed that the choice of images and sounds should remain the prerogative of the filmmaker, though some used by Zulawski \\"could denaturate the appreciation of the work interpreted by Rostropovich.\\" Reception The film received mixed reviews. Variety said \\"as tumultuous as Mussorgsky's great opera is, Zulawski's galloping camera and manic actors more often compete rather than support or illustrate the music and epic drama.\\" Positif said \\"the mise-en- sc√®ne, constantly intelligent, gives a privilege to the spectacular nature of the story; it regains the beauty of the opera through the poignant and colorful images. Le Monde remarked: \\"it's impossible to talk here about \\"film- opera\\" in a merely illustrative sense. One should let yourself to be carried by the admirable cinematic work, confirming, as if it was necessary, the Shakespearean temperament of the author of...notable works of the French cinema of the recent years.\\" Phil Powrie called the film \\"a remarkable achievement, matched only, in my view, by...

He is best known for the first British solo ascent of the north face of the Eiger in 1981, and for his climbs on the Matterhorn and South Col on Mount Everest. In 1986, he became the first person to BASE jump from the Eiger. Early life Raised on a farm near Ruthin in north Wales, he attended Ysgol Brynhyfryd and as a boy was interested in parachuting and skydiving, and later wanted to sign up with the Parachute Regiment. However, an earlier injury - a result of a motorbike accident - led to his joining the Military Police whilst on his two-year National Service. Jones took up skydiving in 1961 and a year later, at the age of 26, began climbing. He climbed extensively in Snowdonia and the Lake District, followed by climbs in Italy. He took up solo climbing when his climbing partner became less available, and found that it gave him the freedom to move quicker, though also brought greater risks. Exploits Leo Dickinson (left) and Eric Jones (right), lecturing in 2019 on their shared adventures. In 1969, Jones ascended the Bonatti Pillar on the Dru solo, and in 1971, he was the first person to climb the Central Pillar of Brouillard on the south ridge of Mont Blanc. Many of his exploits, such as the Eiger ascentAdventure Eye website and the Matterhorn ascent, have been filmed by award winning cameraman Leo Dickinson. Jones and Dickinson, with two other climbers, made the first complete film of the Eiger climb in 1970, with Jones' first British solo ascent following in 1981, resulting in the acclaimed film Eiger Solo. Dickinson who wrote a book called Filming the Impossible also worked with Jones when he filmed Ice Climbing with Eric Jones in Switzerland. Skydiving and basejumping As a skydiver, Jones jumped onto the North Pole and down the east face of Cerro Torre in Patagonia. In 1991, as a member of a four-man team, he flew two hot air balloons over Mount Everest, an exploit which gained three entries in the Guinness Book of Records. Jones had made an earlier attempt in 1978 on Everest, as part of a team that included Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler, but had to turn back because of frostbite. Having jumped from balloons as a skydiver, Jones started BASE jumping (jumping from a fixed object - natural or man-made) at the age of 50, having met renowned jumper Moe Villetto. Combining jumping with his other interests, his first BASE jump was off the Eiger, the first person to do this. He made a number of spectacular jumps from buildings and bridges in the United States, but is renowned for his jump off the Angel Falls in Venezuela, shown in the documentary film The Man Who Jumped To Earth (UK, 1998) directed by Steve Robinson. At the age of 61, he is the oldest person to have done this. His jump into the Cave of Swallows in Mexico, directed by Llion Iwan, was shown in the documentary The Man Who Jumped Beneath The Earth (2003). Jones worked side by side with Sean Connery on the film Five Days One Summer, where fellow climber Paul Nunn worked as a stunt double for Connery. His self-proclaimed motto is \\"Life is adventure or nothing at all\\". Personal life Eric Jones' cafe at Tremadog (a former filling station), viewed from Craig Bwlch y moch. He is married to Ann, and has two children. Featured in the Lifestyle section of The Independent in January 2008, he said : :After we had kids, people would ask if I wasn't being irresponsible for doing all these things but my take is that everything in life involves risk and it's about weighing up those risks. When people go into climbing, they can start out with a macho attitude but you learn to be humble and realise you're there on nature's sufferance. You don't conquer a mountain and if you go out there with that attitude, it will bite you back. For three decades he has owned and run a small cafe (Eric Jones' Cafe) and campsite at Tremadog, near Porthmadog, which is popular with climbers and bikers alike. Some of his exploits can be seen in photos on the walls. In 2016 he put these properties up for sale. Later life Jones is regarded by many of his peers as Britain's most successful solo climber. An unassuming man, he still walks, climbs, skis and jumps,S4C website and a recent documentary by S4C screened in 2007/8 called Alpau Eric Jones saw him revisiting the Alps. He also still gives occasional lectures on his experiences, and has in the past co-presented with Dickinson.

Summary Taking On the System is presented as a political primer for a new generation of progressive activists. The book is centered on the argument that in order to bring about change in the Information Age, activists will need to learn how to bypass traditional barriers to mass communication by effectively exploiting newly emerging media such as blogs, podcasts and video hosting services like YouTube. Moulitsas has cited Saul Alinsky's Rules for Radicals as a direct inspiration for Taking On the System, referring to his book as \\"sort of a Rules for Radicals for the digital age\\": > It‚Äôs no secret that I have little love for the old-school street protest > model of activism ‚Äì not because I‚Äôm opposed to street theater, but because > it‚Äôs simply not effective in today‚Äôs world.

The Affairs of Dobie Gillis is a 1953 comedy musical film directed by Don Weis. The film is based on the short stories by Max Shulman collected as The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis (also the title of the later TV series). Bobby Van played Gillis in this musical version, co-starring with Debbie Reynolds and Bob Fosse. The movie was filmed in black and white, MGM's first non-color musical film in years. It was Fosse's screen debut. Plot summary At Grainbelt University, a Midwestern university, freshmen Dobie Gillis (Bobby Van) and Charlie Trask (Bob Fosse) court coeds Pansy Hammer (Debbie Reynolds) and Lorna Ellingboe (Barbara Ruick). They attend the same courses because Lorna is pursuing Dobie, who is pursuing Pansy, and Charlie is pursuing Lorna. Pansy is studious, and is encouraged by her father George (Hanley Stafford) to \\"learn learn learn\\" and \\"work work work,\\" while Dobie, Charlie and Lorna only want to have fun. Pansy's father can't stand Dobie and does everything in his power to keep them apart. Dobie and Pansy manage to blow up the chemistry lab, but Dobie is spared expulsion because the officious English professor Pomfritt (Hans Conried) is misled to believe that the feckless Gillis is a literary genius. Pansy is sent to a school in New York after the chemistry lab incident. With the help of Charlie and Lorna, Dobie figures out a way of getting Pansy back to Grainbelt. Cast * Bobby Van as Dobie Gillis, a freshman * Debbie Reynolds as Pansy Hammer * Bob Fosse as Charlie Trask, a freshman * Barbara Ruick as Lorna * Hans Conried as Prof. Pomfritt * Hanley Stafford as George Hammer, Pansy's father * Lurene Tuttle as Mrs. Eleanor Hammer * Charles Lane as Chemistry Professor Obispo * Archer MacDonald as Harry Dorcas * Kathleen Freeman as 'Happy Stella' Kowalski * Almira Sessions as Aunt Naomi * Charles Halton as Dean (Granbelt University) Production Carleton Carpenter was tentatively cast in the film, along with Reynolds, Van and Ruick, after MGM bought Shulman's stories. The original plan was to turn the film into a series, along the lines of the Andy Hardy and Dr. Kildare movie franchise, if the film was successful. The film was Bob Fosse's film debut, released before Give a Girl a Break, which was filmed previously. According to MGM records the film earned $423,000 in the US and Canada and $154,000 elsewhere, resulting in a loss of $131,000. Critical reaction  At the time of release, a Philadelphia Inquirer reviewer called the film \\"agreeable\\" and cited Van's \\"rubber-legged grace, reminiscent of Ray Bolger. The Los Angeles Times called it a \\"lightweight, lightheaded comedy,\\" and said the Max Shulman screenplay \\"is, shall we say, charitably, innocuous,\\" The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette called the film \\"a small musical\\" that was \\"hung on the weakest imaginable plot,\\" and said that it was \\"an insignificant piece of fluff\\" that was \\"hardly up to the standardsa of its principals, all of whom seem entirely too attractive and talented to be bothering with such nonsense.\\" But the review credited the actors and director with nevertheless pulling off \\"a presentable entertainment.\\" The film was playing Pittsburgh as a double feature with Tarzan and the She-Devil. More recently, an Allmovie review criticized the film's \\"desperate, artificial perkiness -- the kind of Hollywood-derived energy that annoys by its phoniness.\\" The review goes on to say \\"Ultimately, though, the trite (and often unbelievable) situations, lame jokes, and banal dialogue overwhelm the good will that the musical numbers engender. Extremely undemanding audiences, or those with a very strong nostalgic bent for the good old days, may enjoy The Affairs of Dobie Gillis, but most are advised to give it a pass.\\"  Legacy  Bob Fosse's biographers have dismissed the film, his movie acting debut, as \\"a minor-league comedy with a few old songs thrown in\\" and as \\"a movie destined to achieve a Zenlike oblivion.\\" In the You Can't Do Wrong Doin' Right number, choreographed by Alex Romero, Fosse displays the explosive style for which he later became known. In his book Big deal: Bob Fosse and dance in the American musical, author Kevin Winkler observes that while Bobby Van tap dances as well as Fosse in that number, Van \\"dances only with his feet while Fosse dances with his whole body.\\" Fosse was disillusioned by his experience making Dobie Gillis and Give a Girl a Break, which was filmed earlier but released after Dobie Gillis. Noting that his screen time was far less in Dobie than in the other film, Fosse later remarked, \\"My parts were getting smaller. I knew what that meant.\\" Songs * \\"You Can't Do Wrong Doin' Right\\" ** Written by Al Rinker and Floyd Huddleston ** Performed by Barbara Ruick, Bob Fosse, Debbie Reynolds and Bobby Van * \\"I'm Thru with Love\\" ** Music by Matty Malneck and Fud Livingston ** Lyrics by Gus Kahn ** Performed by Bobby Van * \\"All I Do Is Dream of You\\" ** Music by Nacio Herb Brown ** Lyrics by Arthur Freed ** Performed by Debbie Reynolds and Bobby Van ** Played during the opening credits and often throughout the picture * Believe Me, if All Those Endearing Young Charms ** Traditional Irish folk song, with lyrics by Thomas Moore ** Performed by Debbie Reynolds and Barbara Ruick * \\"Red River Valley (song)\\" ** Traditional ** Played by the band during the square dance References External links   * The Affairs of Dobie Gillis at FANDANGO Category:American black-and-white films Category:1953 films Category:1953 musical comedy films Category:American films Category:American musical comedy films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on short fiction Category:Films directed by Don Weis Category:Films set in universities and colleges Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films Category:The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis Category:Films based on multiple works of a series Category:1953 comedy films ","title":"The Affairs of Dobie Gillis"},{"id":"24093046","text":"The Negheriting Shiva Doul is a Shiva temple at Dergaon in Assam, India. Situated on a hillock at about one and half km north from the National Highway 37 in the Golaghat district of Assam, the temple was first constructed by the Kacharis during 8th ‚Äì 9th century AD. Later due to natural calamities it came into destruction. In 1687 it was re-constructed by Ahom king Swargadeo Rajeswar Singha. The famous architect assigned to the job was Ghanashyam Khonikar. History It is believed that the stones used to construct the temple were existed in the bank of river Dihing. Due to natural calamities the temple was destroyed and the remains were found in deep forest called Gajapanemara. However, as the Dihing river changed the course, the temple was again destroyed and merged into the river water. A devotee of lord Shiva found the ruined temple and the linga in the shallow water of river Dihing, now this place is known as Sheetal Negheri. Ahom king Rajeswar Singha (1751‚Äì1769) brought the linga from the river and reconstructed the present temple and established the Shivalinga in it. Architecture The main temple is surrounded by four other temples namely the Vishnu, Ganesha, Surya and Durga temple. A Banalinga of 3 feet in diameter is established in the main temple. According to legend a Rishi named Urba wanted to establish a second Kashi right on this place for which he collected many Shiva lingas there. The name The place where the temple is located was once the habitat of a peculiar bird locally known as Negheri. From this name the place has come to be known as Negheriting. Maintenance A priest named Bhudhar Agamacharji was appointed by king Rajeswar Singha for proper maintenance of the temple and also for the rituals to be performed. The Agamacharji family still performs worship and other maintenance works regularly. Customs of performing songs and dances called Deonati were prominent there in the temple. The Monkeys One of the attractions of the temple is the monkeys. The temple is the house of the rhesus monkeys where a sizeable population of this species is there.

It provides an opportunity for skeptics to talk, share ideas and have fun in a casual atmosphere, and discuss whatever topical issues come to mind, while promoting skepticism, science, and rationality.  Format  \\"Skeptics in the Pub\\" is not a protected term, anyone can set one up. There also is no formal procedure to organising an event; organisers can fill in activities as they see fit. There are, however, some common approaches across the world in hosting such events that make them more successful. The usual format of meetings includes an invited speaker who gives a talk on a specific topic, followed by a question-and-answer session. Other meet-ups are informal socials, with no fixed agenda. The groups usually meet once a month at a public venue, most often a local pub. There are now more than 100 different \\"SitP\\" groups running around the world. History  London  The earliest and longest-running event is the award-winning London meeting, established by Australian philosophy professor Scott Campbell in 1999. Campbell based the idea around Philosophy in the Pub and Science in the Pub, two groups which had been running in Australia for some time. The inaugural speaker was Wendy M. Grossman, the editor and founder of The Skeptic magazine, in February 1999; this first talk attracted 30 attendees. The London group claims to be the \\"World's largest regular pub meeting,\\" with 200 to 400 people in attendance at each meeting. Campbell ran the London group for three years while there on a teaching sabbatical, and was succeeded after his return to Australia by two sci-fi fans and skeptics, Robert Newman and Marc LaChappelle. Nick Pullar, who made a television appearance as \\"Convener of Skeptics in the Pub\\" on the BBC spoof show Shirley Ghostman, then led the group from 2003 to 2008. As of 2011, the London group was co-convened by Sid Rodrigues, who has co-organised events in several other cities around the world. This group has conducted experiments on the paranormal as part of James Randi's One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge and co-organised An Evening with James Randi & Friends.  Around the world  The ease of use of the internet, via social networking sites and content management systems, has led to more than 100 active chapters around the world, including more than 30 in the US and more than 40 in the UK. In 2009, D. J. Grothe described the rise of Skeptics in the Pub across cities in North America and elsewhere as a prominent example of \\"Skepticism 2.0\\". SITPs were often founded outside the realm of existing skeptical organisations (mostly centred around magazines), with some successful meetings growing out to become fully-fledged membership organisations. \\"Skeptics in the Pub\\" would later serve as the template for other skeptical, rationalist, and atheist meet-ups around the globe, including The James Randi Educational Foundation's \\"The Amazing Meeting\\", Drinking Skeptically, The Brights, and the British Humanist Association social gatherings. Since 2010 Edinburgh Skeptics in the Pub has extended the Skeptics in the Pub concept over the whole Edinburgh International Festival Fringe, under the banner Skeptics on the Fringe and from 2012 done the same at the Edinburgh International Science Festival with the title At The Fringe of Reason. The Merseyside Skeptics Society and Greater Manchester Skeptics (forming North West Skeptical Events Ltd) hosted three two-day conferences, QED, in February 2011, March 2012 and April 2013. Glasgow Skeptics has also hosted two one-day conferences, as of July 2011. Notable guests Over the past ten years, the London event has featured lectures by well-known scientists and skeptics.

In August 2009 shortly after the breakup of the Thorns of Life, Blake Schwarzenbach (formerly of Jets to Brazil and Jawbreaker) announced his involvement in a new band, Forgetters, with original Against Me! drummer Kevin Mahon and Caroline Paquita. In November 2009, the Village Voice remarked that \\"If they wanted to, probably, Forgetters... could be a 'supergroup'‚Äîdrummer Kevin Mahon played in the first Against Me! lineup, and bassist Caroline Paquita was in Bitchin'‚Äîbut mostly they keep a low profile\\". The band has been described as \\"a lean, rough power trio\\" by the Chicago Reader.

The EP was released to positive reviews; Willamette Week called it \\"a gorgeously drunken stumble through the East Bay's fog and smog\\". In early 2011, Forgetters mounted a tour of the West Coast, and in April and May 2011, the band embarked on a European tour. Paquita left the band after the European tour.

On November 13, 2012, the band released its debut album, produced by J. Robbins who also played the bass guitar on the record. Following the release of their full length, the band quietly ceased operations and eventually disbanded in. In 2017, Schwarzenbach reunited with Jawbreaker.

The 2008 Lexus LS 600h was the second vehicle to feature the active stabilizer system. Active Power Stabilizer Suspension System (APSSS), is an electric active suspension system with active anti-roll bars developed by Toyota Motor Corporation for its high-end vehicles including Lexus models. By altering stabilizer bar stiffness, this system acts to reduce body tilt during cornering, keeping the vehicle more level during turns and improving handling, as opposed to the natural tendency of a vehicle to roll due to the lateral forces experienced during high-speed maneuvering. The active stabilizer system relies on vehicle body sensors and electric motors. The first production usage of this system was introduced in August 2005 with the Lexus GS430 sport sedan, followed by the 2008 Lexus LS 600h luxury sedan. The development of APSSS is claimed to be the world's first electric active stabilizer system.Aisin developing systems in the pursuit of active safety It is a system improvement of an earlier Toyota technology called Toyota TEMS (Toyota Electronic Modulated Suspension). How it works The APSSS utilizes sensors for steering wheel speed, steering angle, along with yaw and acceleration/deceleration sensors. These sensors are tied to an electronic control unit (ECU), which in turn connects with actuators consisting of 46V DC brushless motors and reduction mechanisms. Mounted with the vehicle suspension stabilizer bars, each reduction mechanism houses a wave generator, flexible gear, and circular gear.Lexus Active Stabilizer Suspension System (PPT) The system is activated when the vehicle enters a high-speed turn, and the sensors register vertical, longitudinal, and transverse forces which contribute to body lean and additional movements. Along with steering data, these are sent to the ECU where they are processed, with the forces necessary to counteract body roll movements calculated. Corrective instructions are then sent to the suspension motors and reduction mechanisms. The reduction mechanism gears activate to adjust suspension rigidity, torquing the stabilizer bars and thus increasing sway resistance and reducing body roll movements. Developed jointly with Aisin, APSSS engineers found that compared with prior hydraulically actuated active suspension systems, which rely on hydraulic servomechanisms, the electric APSSS offered a faster response time (within 20 milliseconds) and reduced energy consumption characteristics.

Goodwin is a British artist and author. She has exhibited extensively, written several works on art and design, and was founder president of the British Association of Modern Mosaics (BAMM). Together with other prominent artists, Goodwin also co-founded Tessellated Expression for the 21st Century (TE-21), a group of professional artists dedicated to exhibitions of the tessellated art form. Education and art career \\"Liquid Gold\\" mosaic at The Eden Project Goodwin studied at the Exeter College of Art and Design, earning a bachelor's degree in Art. She subsequently gained international recognition with her artwork, and one of her first exhibitions, in 1991, was with the Barbican Centre in London. In subsequent years, Goodwin has exhibited her work around Europe, Japan, Egypt, and Morocco. The majority of Goodwin's artworks are abstract pieces, using a combination of light- reflecting materials such as Venetian gold, smalti, and Carrara marble. Goodwin has stated that her art is \\"...about light...For all who look, at each and every moment, light is held, captured, and let go\\". With her extensive experience as an artist, Goodwin lectures and gives master classes, and has performed a curatorial role for the Royal Albert Memorial Museum in Exeter. Goodwin has accepted many private and public commissions. One of these is a mosaic walkway and pyramid installation that she created for the Eden Project in Cornwall. The pyramid and walkway, which is in the Mediterranean biome, is titled \\"Liquid Gold\\" and displays Goodwin's signature use of shiny gold and silver materials. Awards Goodwin was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Exeter in July 2010.. Goodwin is an elected member of the Chelsea Arts Club in London. Forty year retrospective The Royal Albert Memorial Museum and art gallery will exhibit work by Goodwin in April 2019. The major retrospective exhibition will celebrate forty years of her art.https://exeterramm.admit-one.eu/?p=eventtimes&ev;=4113 Publications Goodwin is the author of several books on mosaics. Her most recent, Mosaic Today: Using New and Recycled Materials in Contemporary Mosaic was published in 2008. Among her other 5 titles is the Encyclopedia of Mosaics: Techniques, Materials and Designs and The Human Form in Mosaic. BAMM and TE-21 The British Association for Modern Mosaics, otherwise known as BAMM, was formed in 1999. It serves to promote mosaic art and publishes a regular newsletter, organises events and viewings, and helps artists network, among many other activities. An original member and elected president, Goodwin helped to form the association with several other artistic professionals. Confronted with the challenges of having mosaic art internationally accepted as a modern, expressive, and saleable medium, Goodwin created TE-21 in 2008, along with fellow artists Lucio Orsoni from Italy, Toyoharu Kii from Japan, and Dugald MacInnes from Scotland. TE-21 is a group of professional mosaicists, exhibiting together around the world, and thereby helping to establish this artistic medium in national galleries and collections. The name, Tessellated Expression for the 21st Century, deliberately avoids the word \\"mosaic\\", due to its common associations with classic and utilitarian design. Personal Goodwin has two sons. In 2016 Goodwin moved her studio homes from Exeter in England and Marrakech in Morocco to Burgundy in France. Here she set up her studios and a large gallery for her work.

It is 62 km long connecting GST Road at Perungalathur, GST Road at Vandalur, NH 48 (GWT Road) at Nazarethpettai, NH 716 (CTH Road) at Thiruninravur to NH 16 (GNT Road) at Vijayanaallur and to TPP road at Minjur. On 29 August 2010, the then Tamil Nadu Deputy Chief Minister M. K. Stalin laid the foundation for the first phase of the project from Vandalur to Nemilichery covering a distance of 30 kilometres (19 mi). The Road generally covers Developing areas like Avadi West such as - Thiruninravur, Pattabiram, Nemilicheri, Muthapudupet, Mittanamallee, Morai, Veerapuram, Thirumullaivoyal (Avadi sidco industrial estate). Chennai Outer ring road had a plan of Chennai metro rail CMRL which is going to build up at gap between two roads. Phases The Project is being developed in 2 phases with 2 segments each. Phase 1 The Phase 1 of the project covers a distance of 29.65 km. 10 Grade separators at major junctions have been planned along this route. It also includes 50 bus bays on both sides and also truck lay-byes for parking of around 100 trucks. Phase I of this project was implemented by GMR, and the project was originally expected to be completed by June 2012. Phase I was thrown open to the public on 29 August 2014, by the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, through Video conferencing. Segment I The Segment I extends from GST Road (Vandalur) to NH48 (Nazarethpettai) covering a distance of 19.7 km. The development covers an area of about 265.38 Hectares. Segment II The Segment II extends from NH48 (Nazarethpettai) to CTH Road (Pattabiram) covering a distance of 9.5 km. The development covers an area of about 140.9 Hectares. Phase II The Phase 2 covers a distance of 33.1 km. Segment III The Segment III extends from CTH Road (Pattabiram) to GNT Road (Nallur) covering a distance of 18.8 km. The development covers an area of about 258.02 Hectares. Planned Developments (PPP mode) Price Waterhouse Coopers (PWC) has done a micro market study on the development of 50 m along the road. It has suggested that the components of the development could include a 5-star hotel, retail segments ‚Äì including an \\"auto main street\\" where the ORR connects industrial suburbs that house automobile giants such as Hyundai, Ford and Renault Nissan ‚Äì and facilities like multiplex, residential, hospital, commercial, warehouse and green spaces. Developers would be identified through open competitive bidding for these projects. High-Growth Zone The region close to NH-45 is seen as a high-growth area covering the Chennai neighbourhoods places Vandalur, Mannivakkam, Mudichur, Thiruninravur, Pattabiram, Muthapudupet, Morai, Malayambakkam-Mangadu, MINJUR and PONNERI (Smart City). This would be the location for a 5-star hotel. Auto Main Street Localities near Minjur and Ponneri, which are hubs of automobile and component industries, would be the ideal locale for the auto main street, which is a niche retail for the automobile industry for which about have been earmarked. Residential Areas Residential areas have been planned for more than 150 acres near MINJUR, PONNERI while residential spaces have been planned at Malayambakkam, NAZARETHPETTAI, AGARAMEL and Poonamallee Three Star Hotels and Multi plus apartments are planned at Malayambakkam (Sri Srinivasa Nagar).

It is a two-story wood frame house dating to the mid-19th century. Inside it has elaborately detailed interiors. It is surrounded by a landscaped front and back yard. Originally it was in the Greek Revival architectural style, with more elaborate decoration on its main facade. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was home to horticulturist Calvin N. Kenney (1849‚Äì1930), breeder of the stringless bean. In 1927, the home was renovated in the Federal Revival style by Bryant Fleming, leaving it with a more restrained main facade. The house and its carriage house were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Buildings and grounds The house is located on a three-quarter‚Äìacre (3,000 m¬≤) lot, more than twice as deep as it is wide, on the south side of Main Street, just east of its intersection with Lake and Clay streets (New York State Route 19) in the center of the village. Most of the neighboring properties are large non-residential structures: a supermarket to the west, the village hall to the east with Le Roy's commercial district on the other side of Route 19, and another large commercial structure to the north across the street. A block of residences begins to the northwest. The terrain begins to slope slightly downward to the east and Oatka Creek at that point. Mature trees and shrubs are planted throughout the landscaped lot. The house sits on a slight rise, with slight terraces climbing up to it from the street. A line of trees screens the property from the village hall property on the east, next to a driveway to the carriage house, and a decorative wooden fence runs from the carriage house along the rear boundary. The building itself has a two-and- a-half-story five-by-two-bay wood frame main block on a stone foundation with two rear wings and a kitchen extension. It is topped with a shallow pitched gabled roof covered in composition tiles and pierced by a brick chimney. The western of the two rear wings is two stories high, the eastern, with the living room, one. Between them a long extension ends in a recessed porch. There is another porch on the east side, from the living room wing to beyond the middle of the extension. Siding consists of clapboard on all facades save the north (front), which uses flushboard. All windows have low-relief molded surrounds and flat cornices. That face's central bay, with the main entrance, is framed by full-height square recessed Doric pilasters, which repeat at the corners. They support a wide molded frieze, above which are small windows with decorative grillwork. Above them is the roof's wide overhanging cornice. Similar Doric pilasters trim the corners of the rear and wings. At the rear of the kitchen extension, the porch has arches on the sides and square Doric piers on the south. Above them a Palladian window is in the gable field. The recessed main entrance is flanked by narrow sidelights and topped with a fanlight. It leads into a long central hall, flanked by a parlor and sitting room at the front. Both have fireplaces with wooden Greek Revival mantels. Arched alcoves flank the parlor fireplaces. Greek Revival woodwork also frames the doors and entryways, and both ceilings have crown molding and a blank frieze. An ornate staircase leads up to the second floor. There the wide central hall divides similarly appointed bedrooms and a study. A suite is located at the end of the south extension. The carriage house is also a frame structure. Its roof is double-gabled on the east side, with two brick chimneys and a latticework cupola. It and the gables are topped with finials. The main entrance on the north is a pedimented portico, supported by two narrow columns rising from stone walls that extend from either side of the main entrance. They are flanked by two sash windows. A circular window fills the gable field above. History The house was built in 1851 by local contractor Philo Pierson for claim agent John Bixby. The two-story rear wing was probably built first, to serve as a temporary residence while the rest of the house went up. The main block combines a late Federal-style form with Greek Revival detailing. Calvin Keeney, a Le Roy native, bought the house from Bixby in 1881. He had left school to join his father's produce business after the Civil War, and ultimately became his father's partner. In 1868 he had hired a Rochester seedman to help develop the stringless bean. Keeney would later be credited with developing 17 varieties of the vegetable, which helped make canning cheaper. He himself started a local cannery and salt works before his death. In 1927 Buffalo architect Bryant Fleming was commissioned to do renovations on the house. He removed a veranda that had been installed around 1900 along with much of the front facade's three-dimensional decoration, making it more of a pure Federal building. To make up for the veranda he had the front lawn terraced and accentuated the front entrance with the fanlight and flanking pilasters, reinforcing those already found on the corners. The fenestration was further enhanced with square plaques at either side of the window heads and the grillwork windows in the attic. In the rear he had the servants' quarters converted into the porch and added the Palladian window. Inside, he had the two front rooms on the east side combined into a large parlor. He also landscaped the backyard. There have been no other significant changes to the house since. After Keeney's death, his daughter Ruth inherited the house. She helped establish the YWCA and Girl Scouts at the national level, and organized the Le Roy Historical Society in her hometown. From her the property passed to her niece Elinor Townsend. Currently, the property is owned by William and Susan Schmidt.

It was filmed in Tel Aviv, Israel. The tagline was \\"Cannon Movie Tales: Lavish, Feature length new versions of the world's best loved storybook classics.\\" The film was released on October 5, 1986 in the United Kingdom and June 1, 1988 in the United States, with an MPAA Rating of G for general audiences of all ages. Plot The Frog Prince begins with the protagonist Princess Zora rolling over and waking up in her bed. When she hears royal trumpets signifying an important announcement, she sings \\"Lucky Day\\" as she gets dressed. She holds onto her golden lucky ball, and carries it throughout her day for good luck. Zora runs through the castle and the Emissary and chef scold her for not acting 'like a princess'. Then, Zora is confronted by Henrietta and Henrietta's friend Dulcey in the hallway, where Henrietta lies to Zora, telling her that they are allowed to interrupt the King that day. After Zora leaves, Henrietta tells Dulcey that she intercepted a letter which declared that only her or Zora is a true princess, not both. Meanwhile, the King, surrounded by his advisors, reads the letter which declares that Baron Von Whobble will decide the true princess at the Sunset Dance. The King is upset because he made a promise to care for both of his nieces (Henrietta and Zora) when his sister died. He then sings \\"A Promise is A Promise\\" with his royal advisors. Princess Zora interrupts the meeting to ask about the trumpet announcement, but becomes too shy to ask when the King gets upset at her for interrupting. After Zora leaves the King, she goes to ask Henrietta why she lied earlier. Henrietta ignores her question as she and Dulcey look through a book of eligible bachelors. They turn the page to see the handsome Prince of Freedly. The book says that a witch put a curse on him and that he has been missing for a year. When Zora asks to see, Henrietta banishes her from the room. That night at dinner, Henrietta arrives elegantly and is praised by the royal advisers. When Zora walks in dressed in a feathered cape, the advisors, Henrietta, and Dulcey laugh at her for looking silly. As Zora realizes she is being made fun of, she flees from the room. Her Uncle, the King, watches sadly, feeling pity for his niece. Zora goes outside that night, wishing for someone to talk to at the edge of a fountain. After dropping her golden ball in the water, the water splashes from below, and a large, fully dressed frog named Ribbit emerges from the water. Zora asks \\"who are you?\\" in awe of the tall frog. To explain his abnormal physique, Ribbit sings \\"too tall frog\\" to Zora. Afterwards, Zora promises to be Ribbit's friend and take him home to the palace, in exchange for him retrieving her lucky ball from the fountain. The two sneak into Zora's chambers. Zora tells Ribbit that she does not think she is beautiful or a lady, and Ribbit says he thinks she is ravishing and that if she looks in the mirror long enough, she will see what he sees. Then, the King knocks on Zora's door and Ribbit has to hide. The King tells Zora there will be a Sunset Dance. After reading the letter, she finds out only one sister will be the princess. Ribbit then helps Zora become princess-like, teaching her how to dance and act ladylike. He then leaves because he needs to get back to the water, but promises to meet her by the fountain the next day. Zora gives him her lucky ball as a gift before he leaves. When Ribbit is back by the water, he admires the gift and sings about his newfound friend in \\"Friendship\\". When Henrietta spies Ribbit teaching Zora how to be a princess, she gets angry, afraid that she will lose her spot as princess. She convinces Dulcey to help kidnap Ribbit and bring him away from the water. They put him in a hole in the ground where they trap him and leave him without water, but Dulcey marks a map of where he is hidden. The next morning, Zora is happy and dressed nicely. She goes to the fountain to meet Ribbit, but he's not there. Zora worries that he doesn't want to be her friend, and she sings \\"Have you forgotten me?\\" as she misses him. Henrietta tells Zora that she took Ribbit to the Woods of the Dark Heart, where he will die without water. Dulcey slips the map to Zora and tells her to hurry if she wants to save him. Zora runs into her uncle, and convinces him that she must help her friend. He tells her to come back before sunset so that the Baron Von Whobble can see her. When searching the woods, Zora gets lost, and only finds Ribbit when her lucky golden ball shines bright from the trap. She pours water on Ribbit through the trap door to save him, and he slowly wakes up. Zora lifts him from the hole using a rope. The two hug, as Zora tells him that she's glad he's alright. She gives him a kiss on the cheek, which turns Ribbit back into the Prince of Freedly. He says there's no time to explain because they must return to the palace so Zora can be crowned the true princess. The lucky ball makes a horse appear, which the two ride back to the palace. While preparing for the coronation, Dulcey tells Henrietta that she is a cruel person and that she would rather be friends with Zora than with her. Meanwhile, the King greets the Baron at the Sunset Dance and attempts to stall the crowd so that Zora can make it back in time for the ceremony. When the Prince of Freedly and Zora make it back to the castle, the Prince tries to bang on the gate in order to get inside. As they struggle outside, Henrietta the eldest enters the ballroom. All of the crowd gasps audibly at her beauty as she enters. Outside, the Prince wishes on the lucky ball that they can enter, and thus, the guard is awoken and opens the gate. Once they make it through, Zora's magic ball gives Zora a beautiful, clean dress. Before Henrietta can be crowned as princess, The Prince of Freedly bursts into the crowning ceremony and announces his identity, and saying that only a true princess could break the frog curse. Since Zora did that, she must be the true princess. The King lets a tear fall as he tells Zora how proud he is of her, and that she is beautiful because true beauty comes from inside. Henrietta is outraged and leaves the ballroom. Baron Von Whobble crowns Zora the true princess, and her Uncle the King escorts her to dance with the Prince of Freedly. The two dance together in front of the whole ballroom, and Zora asks \\"Are you really the Prince of Freedly?\\" In response, he says, \\"Yes, but do you know what my friends call me?\\" Finally, she says \\"Yes I do.

German-Russian Museum Berlin- Karlshorst  The museum building  thumb|Soviet bas-relief sculpture in the museum The museum is located at the historical venue of the unconditional surrender of the German armed forces (Wehrmacht) on 8 May 1945. With this act of ratification in Karlshorst of the instrument of surrender signed the day before in Rheims, World War II came to an end in Europe. The building was the officers' mess of the Wehrmacht pioneer school and then the headquarters of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany. In 1949 at this location the Soviets handed over administrative authority to the first government of the German Democratic Republic (GDR). From 1967 to 1994 the building contained a branch of the ‚ÄúCentral Museum of Armed Forces Moscow‚Äù featuring the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany in the Great Patriotic War. After German-Soviet agreements on the withdrawal of Soviet armed forces from Germany in 1990, Germany and the Soviet Union decided to jointly recollect in the museum the history of the German-Soviet war and the end of Nazi rule. After restructuring the permanent exhibition, the German-Russian Museum opened to the public in May 1995.  Permanent exhibition  The permanent exhibition, which attracts about 40,000 visitors annually, conveys on ca. 1,000 square meters an impression of the history of German-Soviet relations from 1917 to 1990. The focus is on the German-Soviet War 1941-1945, including the political background, propaganda and hostile stereotypes, and the day-to-day life of soldiers and civilians on both sides of this conflict during different phases of the war. The heart of the museum is the surrender room, which is in its original state and where a film continuously shows the signing the Act of Surrender in 1945. In addition to the redesigned modern exhibition rooms, parts of the original Soviet exhibition designed for Soviet soldiers stationed in Berlin can also be seen, as well as monuments from Soviet times. On the grounds there is a memorial in which a Soviet T34 tank is integrated on a pedestal, as well as an exhibit of large items of Soviet military equipment from World War II and the postwar period. Marshal Georgy Zhukov reading the German capitulation in Berlin. Seated on his right is Arthur Tedder, Marshal of the Royal Air Force and Eisenhower's deputy for the Western Headquarters.  Special exhibits and other activities  Two to three times a year the museum presents special exhibits in a room of about 100 square meters which became available end of 1997. Topics include memories of the war as well as subjects relating to German-Soviet/Russian relations. The museum staff draws on its extensive collection of documents, war relics and photographs to prepare these exhibits. Parts of these special exhibits have been shown in other German, Russian and Ukrainian cities. In addition to the displays, for each special exhibit the museum publishes a catalog in German and Russian which is usually also available in the book trade. Other activities include scientific colloquia, conferences, educational museum tours for school classes, and thematic study tours to Belarus and Russia. By means of its exhibits and public events the museum strives to create a space for a critical analysis of history, for education, for encounters, and for increased understanding between Germans and Russians. A museum celebration takes place annually on May 8, the date World War II ended in Europe.  Board of trustees  The German-Russian Museum Berlin-Karlshorst is a so-far unique bi-national institution supported by the Federal Republic of Germany and the Russian Federation. The board of trustees was jointly established in 1994 and contains an equal number of German and Russian bodies. The chairmanship alternates between the General Director of the German Historical Museum and the Director of the Central Museum of Armed Forces Moscow. Additional board members include representatives of the Great Patriotic War Museums in Minsk and Kiev.  Collections  The collection contains many objects from the Central Museum of Armed Forces Moscow. In addition there are items and loans from other German and Eastern European collections, gifts and legacies. The museum collects documents, posters, items revealing day-to-day military life during the war, militaria with an emphasis on military medicine, and photographs. The image archive contains primarily photographs taken by Soviet and German professional and amateur photographers during the war. The museum has a specialized library on German-Soviet relations with a focus on the war on the Eastern Front. It contains some 3,000 volumes as well as an extensive collection of photographs and can be consulted by outside users for research purposes on request.

The house is a stucco- faced stone building in the Greek Revival architectural style. It was originally a land office, expanded in two stages during the 19th century by its builder, Jacob Le Roy, an early settler for whom the village is named. In the rear of the property is the village's first schoolhouse, a stone building from the end of the 19th century. Le Roy expanded the small land office into a large house, with finely decorated interior. After its completion, he hosted the reception following Daniel Webster's second marriage, to one of Le Roy's sisters. Later it served as a residence for educational administrators of both Ingham University and the local public schools. During the late 19th century it was subdivided into a boardinghouse for faculty and students at Ingham and the Le Roy Academic Institute, an early secular private school. Upon the establishment of the Le Roy Historical Society in 1941 it became the local historical museum. The school was originally an addition built on a frame building, first for the Le Roy Academic Institute and then the local public school district, which it served as a high school. Its educational use ended in the early 20th century. For several decades afterward it was used as a factory for the manufacture of patent medicines. Since the 1940s it has been a property of the historical society. Museums The Le Roy House is today owned by the Le Roy Historical Society and operated as historic house museum, with 19th century period rooms, a room with Morganville Pottery items, and exhibits of local history. The school has also been converted into the Jell-O Gallery, devoted to the history and marketing of Jell-O, which was invented and first manufactured in Le Roy.Upstate, Where It Was First Made, Unwavering Devotion to Jell-O, New York Times, May 4, 2008 Buildings and grounds Both buildings are located on a lot along the north side of East Main Street, 500 feet (150 m) east of Oatka Creek. Across the street is a small park and Le Roy's current elementary school , built in the early 20th century. The surrounding neighborhood is otherwise mostly residential, with other large houses from the 19th century and the First Baptist Church at the creek. The deep lot has the house on the street, followed by a small parking lot, the school and a Little League baseball field in the very rear. A line of trees delineates the property boundaries. In 1997 both buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. House The house is a two-and-a- half-story stucco-faced limestone structure with a raised foundation and side- gabled roof shingled in asphalt. Two brown brick chimneys with concrete caps pierce it at either end. The roofline has broad overhanging eaves on the north and south and a dentilled pedimented cornice on the east and west. On the north (rear) elevation is a full-width one-story porch on a concrete foundation with limestone steps. Its hipped roof is supported by round Tuscan columns and louvered panels at the sides. Exterior Its south (front) facade frames the centrally located main entrance in a hip roofed portico with classical entablature supported by paired fluted Doric columns with indented capitals. All windows on the facade are tripartite, with 12-over-12 double- hung sash flanked by three-over-three sidelights on the first story complemented by eight-over-eight and two-over-two on the second. All have plain lintels and wooden shutters for the sidelights. At the basement level a window on the west side provides light; the corresponding opening on the east has been bricked in. The side elevations are asymmetrically fenestrated, reflecting the house's phased expansion. Both have a six-over-six window flanked by quarter-round windows in the pediments. On the east are three six- over-six windows in the northern bays, and two on the first in the two northernmost bays. The west face's second story is fully fenestrated, but with an eight-over-eight in the second bay from north dropped a half-story. Below it, the first story has, from the south, a six-over-six, eight-over-eight, six-over-six and four-over-four, all with stone sills. The north elevation has tripartite windows like those on the opposite face surrounding the rear entrance, a six-panel door with narrow six-light sidelights and four-light transom. The second story has three six-over-six windows aligned with the first-story windows. Interior Paired paneled pilasters flank the six- light sidelights aside the main entrance, topped by another four-light transom. The six-panel wooden door opens into a central hall running the depth of the house. In the middle an elliptical arch with molded soffit panels and reeded wood trim and keystones. A similar arch on the adjacent wall leads into the stair hall. Flooring throughout the first story is four-inch (10 cm) wooden board with the plaster walls covered by reproduction wallpaper. On either side of the center hall are two large rooms. The southwest room is decorated to approximate the building's original function as a land office. Wooden shutters for the 12-over-12 at the center of the tripartite window are on the adjacent interior walls. The doors and windows have reed surrounds with molded corner blocks. The west wall's fireplace mantel has a classical entablature, Doric columns and a glazed brick hearth. Next to the chimney breast are French doors leading into the northwest room. A closed portion in the northeast corner houses the original circular stairway. The northwest room is currently the Le Roy Historical Society's office. Another six-panel wooden door with molded surround opens into it from the center hall. Its west wall fireplace has a wood mantel with reeded pilasters and molded square corner blocks. To its north a built-in bookcase spans the wall. The east wall has a kitchen unit, and the room is floored in linoleum. East of the center hall, the two parlors have the greatest degree of decoration. The smaller southeast one has ornate wooden surrounds and plaster cornice moldings at the ceiling. The tripartite window is recessed and flanked by fluted pilasters. On the east the fireplace mantel has a classical entablature and engaged Ionic columns. A ten-foot-wide (3 m) cased opening separates the two eastern parlors. It has some of the same decorative motifs seen elsewhere on the first floor, such as reed molding and molded corner blocks, along with a molded inset panel at the center. From the front, a classical entablature and Tuscan columns frame the view to the tripartite window in the rear. Along its sides, lined with shallow molded wood paneling, are shallow closets. In the northeast parlor, the tripartite window is similarly recessed and flanked by pilasters. The fireplace mantel has an inset molded panel, classical entablature and engaged Tuscan columns. On either side are the six-over-six windows with reeded pilaster finish and molded corner blocks. Another six-panel wooden door opens into the center hall. On the second floor, an identical arch spans the center hall south of the top of the stair. The decoration is more restrained, with simpler door and window surrounds and a ceiling medallion in the north section of the hall made of concentric circles. The same wide flooring planks are used everywhere on the floor except for the bathroom. All rooms are accessed by six-paneled wooden doors with half-glazing consisting of hand-painted frosted glass depicting landscapes, ruins, birds or animals. A storage space has been created from part of the southeast bedroom, which has a fireplace with plain wood mantel. It is currently used to exhibit a collection of period children's toys. The similar bedroom across the hall is now used as a research library. Its northeast corner has also been partitioned to create a bathroom with wooden wainscoting along its walls. The largest of the second floor bathrooms, the northeast one, has a fireplace with a Federal style mantel featuring classical entablature, inset molded panel and flanking pilasters. The molding on the door surround is the most detailed of any on the floor. It is currently used for storage. The bedroom across the hall has period furnishings and is used as an exhibit. Its mantel is similar. Upstairs, the third floor is closed to the public and used for storage of collection material not currently on exhibit. It has a center hall dividing three small rooms on the west side from a large ballroom on the east. A small alcove projects from the west side of that room. There is extra storage space beneath the eaves on the north and south. The walls and ceilings are done in plaster. From the rear of the stair hall on the first floor, another set of stairs leads down to the basement. It, too, has a center hall with six rooms. Three are open to the public and used for exhibits. In the southeast is a kitchen exhibit, in accordance with the bake oven in the open fireplace and open shelving along the east and north walls. It has a stone floor, plaster walls, and wooden shiplap ceiling. In the southwest corner of the basement is the oldest room in the house, used for cold storage. It has a stone floor and vaulted brick ceiling, with walls of mortared limestone. To its north is a smaller vaulted room with a brick vault on the main floor, formerly the site of the cistern that collected rainwater from the roof. The northwest room houses a ceramics exhibit, and has exposed blue shale in its west wall. Opposite, in the northeast, is the boiler room. The remaining room, in the center of the west side below the stairwell, is a small bathroom. School The school building is a three-story five-by- eight-bay limestone building with wooden interior framing. It is topped by an asphalt hipped roof with flared eaves and exposed rafter tails. Its raised basement has larger blocks and is separated by a water table. At the south end of the west elevation is the current main entrance. It has a porch with a concrete deck, metal staircase and guiderails. Its roof is done in beaded wood paneling similar to that once used inside the school. The surrounding masonry work is different since the door was added later. Fenestration on that side consists of three aligned pairs of double-hung sash windows, one-over-one at the basement and first story, and two six-over-ones flanking a wooden door on the second. On the east (rear) are aligned windows, likewise six one-over-one on the first story and seven six-over-one on the second. The basement windows have been bricked in, as has the first-story window at the north end. The same pattern of six-over-one above one-over-one obtains on the north side, with the three windows to the west being narrower. At the first story's northeast corner is a secondary entrance with a vinyl siding enclosure. It leads to the basement. The south, the side facing the street, is similar to the other faces except for having two narrow windows in the westernmost bay. All its windows have rock-faced lintels and smooth sills. Interior The paneled main entrance door, with single-light sidelights and transom, opens into a hall running along the west side. It is currently used as a gift shop and admission area for the museum. In the wider central portion of the hall is the freestanding chimney, its breast faced in plaster, with turned wooden cornerbeads and beaded fir wainscoting. A small administrative office is in the southwest corner. Next to it, on the southeast, is the main exhibit room. The natural light from the windows is supplemented by modern track lighting on the beaded fir ceiling. The beaded fir wainscoting, ceiling and floor are original but have been refinished; the door to the west hall has been removed. A sliding track door opens into the northeast room, currently used for storage. It has similar finishes, and a non-functional freight lift on the east wall. Also on the east wall, a five-panel door opens into the closed stair along the east wall. A small storage room in the northwest corner is accessed from this space, divided from the main hall by a partially glazed wall on the south. The stair itself, located behind another paneled door at the north end of the entrance hall, is lit by the windows on that elevation. The dogleg stair itself has simple square balusters, a molded top round rail and square newel. Upstairs, another west hallway with a small room in the southwest corner gives access to three rooms of nearly equal size. All have paneled doors leading to the hallway, and each other. The finishes on this level are all original; none have been renovated. The northeast room is slightly larger than the other two. It has the upper level of the freight lift, and a beaded-front cabinet below the window on the east wall. On the north wall is a steam radiator. The plaster has been removed on the south and east walls near the chimney, exposing the lath beneath. The chimney itself is in the northwest corner. In the south room the original blackboards remain on either side of the door on the north wall. Plaster has been stripped from that wall as well. Another steam radiator is along the south wall. The basement has brick walls and a wood floor over concrete. Due to accumulated moisture over the years some of the wood has rotted, and the brick facing has been damaged. It is used for the storage of vehicles and other large items. History The house originated with a land office from the earliest days of Le Roy's settlement, a building still structurally part of the house. After Jacob Le Roy expanded it considerably, its use as a single-family house lasted until the Civil War, when it was subdivided to become a boarding house. Since 1941 it has been the historical society's property. The school was original the west wing of an earlier frame structure, demolished in the 20th century. After being closed down, it was used as a factory for several decades. 1793‚Äì1817:Settlement of Le Roy After the Revolutionary War, Robert Morris bought the land west of the Genesee River which now makes up Western New York from the state of Massachusetts. Most of this he later sold to the Holland Land Company, but in 1793 the New York firm of LeRoy & Bayard acquired from him. Because of its shape, stretching from the current village of Le Roy to the shores of Lake Ontario and widening to the north, it was called the Triangle Tract. The intersection of Oatka Creek with a popular Iroquois trail was an obvious place to establish a settlement, and four years after the Triangle Tract was purchased a man named Charles Arthur built a log cabin on the north side of what is now Main Street, just east of the future village's municipal boundary. He sold it a year later to a Capt. John Ganson, who expanded it into a tavern. Other settlers came, attracted by the fertile soils of the Oatka valley, and three years later, in 1802, the first bridge was built over the creek. In 1813 the community was named after Herman Le Roy, senior partner in the landowning firm and former director of the Bank of the United States. He bought more land south of the Triangle Tract's tip, a purchase known as the Five Hundred Acre Tract, to attract more settlers. When the land was fully surveyed in 1817, he sent his nephew Egbert Benson Jr. to Le Roy to serve as the company's agent. alt=A grainy black and white photograph of an old man with glasses wearing a bowtie and jacket, sitting on a chair 1818‚Äì47: Initial construction and residence The two-story brick building Benson had constructed on the site of the current house is its earliest section. At that time it had an entrance on the west (now a window) and a narrow circular stair to the garret. An adjoining room to the north had a vaulted ceiling. The basement had the extant cistern and cold storage. Four years later, in 1821, the community had been subdivided into lots and was thriving, with mills and other industries being established. Jacob Le Roy, a son of Herman's who had traveled abroad learning the family business after studies at Yale, replaced his cousin as company agent. Two years later he bought the land office building and began expanding it into a house for himself and his family. By 1823 it had reached its current size. Le Roy had added a two-story addition to the rear, doubling the interior, and the attic story. The new section was reportedly modeled after New York City townhouses of the era. Fruit trees and flowering shrubs were planted around the house at this time. Six years later, in 1829, Le Roy hosted the reception after Daniel Webster's wedding to one of his sisters. The last of the Triangle Tract lots was sold by 1837, and the land office was formally closed. In the 1840s the front portico was added, giving the house its strong Greek Revival character. The stucco facing, added some time after the rear was built, further unified the house's appearance. After the company's decision to raise prices on some former Holland properties it had acquired met with widespread local resistance in some areas and violence against one of the company's other offices, Jacob sold the house to Alfred Bartow and returned to New York City. He died there in 1847. 1848‚Äì91: Ingham Seminary Bartow built the rear veranda. He replaced the original interior doors with the decorative glass-paneled ones currently in use sometime during the 1840s and '50s. He also oversaw extensive additions to the grounds, such as large barns, expanded gardens, and the replacement of a stone wall with iron filigreed gate posts. Two drives on either side made a circle around the veranda. In 1856 he moved out. In 1837 Mariette and Emily Ingham had established the LeRoy Female Seminary in a nearby house. Its first chancellor, Dr. Samuel Hanson Cox, lived in the Le Roy House during his tenure. His development of the school's curriculum led it to become Ingham Collegiate Institute and then Ingham University in 1857. During the 1860s pipelines were laid to the house to provide gas for heating and lighting. Citizens of the village, including Bartow, established the non- sectarian LeRoy Academic Institute in 1864 in a small building on Main Street. Within a year it had outgrown that space, and the institute's trustees bought the Le Roy House from Cox. They built a two-story wood frame school on the site of the present school, with enough space for 250 students. The house itself was used to board faculty and some students. The interior was altered extensively during this period. Signs of former partitions remain on the floors of the large bedrooms upstairs, and the irregular fenestration of the side elevations also reflects this subdivision of the interior space. During the 1880s the basement kitchen was remodeled, with the shiplap ceiling added and the original fireplace and bake oven bricked shut. 1890‚Äì1941: School and factory In 1890, four small rural school districts in the area were consolidated into the Le Roy Union Free School District, the precursor of today's Le Roy Central School District. The following year the new district's trustees voted to acquire the house and school from the institute for $10,000 ($ in contemporary dollars). The institute's trustees in turn voted to dissolve it. Seven years later, in 1898, the school district built a stone addition, the extant building, onto the frame building. By 1904 it had been renamed Le Roy Union High School. Its student population soon outgrew this space, and seven years later the current Le Roy Junior/Senior High School was built across Main Street and Trigon Park. The old school's last year was 1911; it has not been used for educational purposes since. The house and school were bought by Allen Olmsted, owner of a local company that manufactured patent medicines, primarily Allen's Foot-Ease powder. He allowed the school district to use the house as a residence for its administrator until a local historical society was organized. The school building he converted into a factory and offices. The basement was used for grinding and mixing; the first story as offices. A freight lift was installed, and a second-story passage built between the stone and wood buildings. 1941‚Äìpresent: Museum In 1941 the local historical society was finally established and took title to the house, restoring the bake oven and brick hearth in the basement kitchen soon afterwards. Olmsted's company was bought by Buffalo-based Foster-Milburn two years later. It continued manufacturing operations in Le Roy for another two years, then moved them to Buffalo. When it did, it transferred the remainder of the property to the historical society. The last change to the house was made in 1958. The rear porch was reconstructed since the original stone wall had deteriorated. It was replaced with a concrete wall. The windows were removed and the space beneath the porch entirely enclosed. The wooden west wing that had served as the original school in the 1860s was demolished in 1962. A new roof and gutter were installed in 1985, and Lexan and wire cloth were added to the basement windows to protect against damage from stray balls on the nearby softball field, also used for Little League. Further renovations were made in 1996 in anticipation of an exhibit on the centenary of Jell-O. This included the installation of electricity, a security system and refinishings of the exhibit rooms on the first floor, including the installation of modern track lighting.

For World Athletics purposes, mountain running takes place on terrain that is mainly off-road, but if there is significant elevation gain on the route, surfaced roads may be used. Courses involve considerable amounts of ascent (for mainly uphill races), or both ascent and descent (for up and down races with the start and finish at similar heights). The average incline is normally between five and twenty per cent. Courses are clearly marked and should avoid dangerous sections. History The WMRA was founded in 1984 as the International Committee for Mountain Running and the decision to change the name to the World Mountain Running Association was taken in 1998. In 1985, the organisation staged the first annual World Mountain Running Trophy.

Patrick Sarsfield Gilmore directed the festival, which lasted some 18 days. The jubilee honored the ending of the Franco-Prussian War.  Brief history  For this well-publicized, high- profile, widely anticipated event, architect William G. Preston designed the \\"colosseum, with a seating capacity of 100,000, ...erected at a cost of half a million dollars.\\" J.H. Wilcox & Co. designed the 43-foot high pipe organ. At opening ceremonies on June 17, 1872, before some 15,000 spectators, Phillips Brooks presented a prayer and Boston mayor William Gaston and Nathaniel Prentice Banks gave speeches. \\"Unfortunately the size of the building and the din of the workmen caused passages of the prayer and speeches to be inaudible.\\" Many musicians performed at the jubilee. During the festival \\"the bands of the Grenadier guards, from London, of the Garde republicaine, from Paris, of the Kaiser Franz regiment, from Berlin, and a band from Dublin, Ireland: with Johann Strauss, the waltz-king, Franz Abt, the German song- writer, and many famous soloists, vocal and instrumental, were among the foreign attractions.\\" One concert featured a \\"performance of Verdi's Il Trovatore by a 2,000-member orchestra, conducted by Johann Strauss, Jr., and 100 assistants, accompanied by a 20,000-voice chorus.\\" (N.B. Vrabel transposes the orchestra and chorus counts). The members of the chorus came \\"from all parts of the Union,\\" and were directed by Carl Zerrahn. A new piece, titled Festival Hymn: Peace and Music, was composed for this Jubilee by American composer, Dudley Buck.Roger Hall. Angel of Peace: The Boston Peace Jubilees, 2010; p. 7. The Fisk University Jubilee Singers also gave a concert, the first time African American \\"singers [were] included in a big musical production\\" in the country.Eileen Southern. Music of Black Americans. New York: W.W. Norton & Co., 1997. Johann Strauss performed on violin: \\"All eyes were riveted upon the expressive face and the almost eloquent arm of Herr Strauss. Every ear was strained to catch a sound from the violin on which he ever and anon laid the bow with a passion and surety unexcelled. A storm of applause marked the conclusion of the waltz, which was at once re-demanded and heard anew.\\" Other performers included pianist Franz Bendel; vocalist Madame Rudersdorff; the United States Marine Band; Arabella Goddard; and Madame Peschka-Leutner. The jubilee provided au courant \\"Press and Telegraph Rooms ...furnished with all desirable accommodations for the members of the press, while the telegraphic facilities are ample for communicating with all parts of the world.\\" Despite enthusiastic audiences, the festival suffered financially, partly from lower- than-expected attendance, and partly from setbacks during construction of the building. Some attendees responded negatively to the experience overall: \\"The great, usurping, tyrannizing, noisy and pretentious thing is over, and there is a general feeling of relief, as if a heavy, brooding nightmare had been lifted from us all.\\" Quoted in: However, the enormousness of the 1872 international jubilee in terms of audience, publicity, and programming created a precedent which served to inspire similar festivals in later years.

It is located on Gulf Road in the Town of Le Roy, New York, United States. Representative of the type of technology developed in the late 19th century and early 20th century to provide large, inexpensive supplies of crushed stone for the vast American railroad network and later for the road construction, it is believed to be the largest intact steam shovel remaining in the world, and may have been used in the excavation of the Panama Canal. No longer operational, it was moved to its current site in the mid-20th century. It is currently owned by the town. In 2008 it became the first steam shovel listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the only listing in the Town of Le Roy and the easternmost in Genesee County. Description The shovel is located on the north side of Gulf Road, east-northeast of the village of Le Roy, just opposite the driveway into the Hanson Company's limestone quarry. It is in a field behind a fence with locked gate. On the road there is space to pull vehicles over and look at it. The Register listing includes an area of about , delineated by a perimeter around the shovel. Note: This includes and Accompanying five photographs While the original decorations have largely faded off the side, in several places on the shovel the Marion name is cast and legible. The model number plates have been removed, but the patent plate is still in place. The shovel weighs . Its main section is the size of a railroad boxcar, wide by long, with an arched roof and siding of riveted sheet metal, now rusted. The operator's cab is on the east-facing front end, with most of the rest of the section housing the shovel's three steam engines and a boiler, no longer in working condition, with horizontal flues. A plate on its door bears the number 5304. An coal bin was added to the rear after it was built. The section rests on two pairs of caterpillar tracks, one pair out in front on a outrigger, the other in the middle. The largest of the three engines is the hoisting engine. It is a double-cylinder horizontal type with a bore and stroke. In addition to powering the hoist, it provided locomotive power and could move the shovel at speeds of a . About of the hoist chain has been removed. alt=The same rusted steamshovel seen in the above picture, with the vegetation around mowed so that its lower section is visible Both of the other engines have an bore. The swing engine, attached to a chain around the swing circle, moves the boom from side to side. The other engine, the boom or crowd engine, raises and lowers the dipper. Due to its exposure to the weather, it is no longer in working condition. The other two, wholly inside the main section, were more protected from the elements and could be operated with compressed air. On the east end is the outrigger. It consists of two joined arms connected by gears and chains to the appropriate engines. At the end is the bucket, with a capacity of . Beneath it is a small pile of rocks. History The Marion Power Shovel Company came into being in the 1880s as a collaboration between a frustrated shovel operator turned inventor and an industrialist. The former, Henry Barnhart, designed a new shovel that he hoped would break down less frequently than existing models. He went into business with financial backing from Edward Huber and patented the idea in 1883. The following year they partnered with another industrialist, George King, and started the company in Marion, Ohio. Over the next decades it grew into a major manufacturer of construction equipment. Steam shovels were in particular demand due to the need for crushed stone as ballast in the nation's railroad network, a demand that expanded in the early 20th century as roads began to be graveled and paved for use by motor vehicles. Le Roy, near the Onondaga Escarpment, was a prime location for limestone quarrying, atop a layer of the stone. Since shortly after its settlement in the early 19th century, Le Roy had supported several such operations. Most of the limestone had been produced for architectural use, and a number of extant buildings in the Le Roy area, including the Lathrop Chapel at Machpelah Cemetery, are made of locally quarried limestone. What eventually became the General Crushed Stone Company was founded in 1899 when the Duerr Contracting Company took over the Le Roy operations of a Tyrone, Pennsylvania, man who had been unable to meet the demands of the Lehigh Valley Railroad, a major customer. After two reorganizations, it became General Crushed Stone in 1902. Headquarters were in South Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The company's president, James Madison Porter, equipped the quarries it operated with new equipment, particularly what was at the time the world's largest rock crusher. It began to pioneer the new field of manufacturing aggregate, particularly a patented blend called Amiesite, for road surfaces. By 1906 it had contracts for of stone annually, two-thirds of which were purchased by the railroad. The Le Roy quarry produced a day, most of which was shipped to the rail yards at Sayre, Pennsylvania. On March 14, 1906 the local newspaper at the time, the Le Roy Gazette, reported on the new equipment that began operation that day. In addition to the rock crusher, it mentioned a \\"100-ton steam shovel that was manufactured specifically for General Crushed Stone by the Barnard [sic] Steam Shovel Company of Marion, Ohio.\\" It cannot be determined if the shovel described is the one currently on the site since a 1932 photograph of the quarry shows two such shovels in action. The Gazette describes the bucket as holding , twice the capacity of the extant shovel's bucket, but the shovel was modified considerably after purchase and it is possible a smaller replacement bucket could have been installed as part of those changes. alt=A black and white photograph showing part of another, similar steam shovel in an area of disturbed earth with a large rock in the bucket Company lore always claimed that the shovel was one of two purchased by General Crushed Stone in 1911 from the Isthmian Canal Commission, which had just finished building the Panama Canal; no documentation has yet been found to support this. It is possible since the shovel is one of 131 Model 91s that Marion manufactured during the first decade of the 20th century. Sixteen were purchased by the commission and used to dig the canal; one of them set what was then a world record in 1912 when it dug of earth from a pit at the site of Gatun Dam. The model plates have been removed from the Le Roy shovel, but it has been conclusively identified as a Model 91 since its dimensions match those in Marion's archived corporate records for the line. No other 91s are known to survive. The Model 91 required eight workers to operate. Four worked in the main section. The operator sat in the front booth and used levers to move the hoist and lift and lower the bucket. When it was time to move the shovel he took care of that as well. A cranesman, who sat on the left-hand side of the boom, controlled the crowd engine, which allowed him to set the depth of the cut and release the bucket's contents when it was full by tugging on a wire rope attached to it. In the rear was an engineer who tended the boiler and a fireman who shoveled the coal. Outside the shovel a crew of four took up and laid the track along which its flanged wheels moved. They also set up the jackscrews necessary to stabilize the shovel in front of the rock face it was digging and dismantled them when it was time to move. This aspect of the excavation process proved to be time-consuming and labor-intensive, as well as dangerous, for such a large piece of machinery. In 1916 Marion began selling conversion kits to allow the shovel to be placed on caterpillar treads; seven years later the General Crushed Stone shovels were so modified. The Model 91 continued in use at the Le Roy quarry through the 1930s, gradually being displaced by newer diesel- powered equipment. At some point before World War II its original wood siding was replaced with the current metal. It continued to be used during the war and managed to avoid the scrap metal drives. In 1949 it was taken out of service and moved to its present location. In the early 1960s the Town of Le Roy acquired the land on which the steam shovel sits. The quarry across the road has remained in operation, now under the ownership of Dolomite (CRH Americas Materials) who donated the stone for the pull-off area to view the shovel. Research continues on whether the shovel actually was used on the Panama Canal.

It applies primarily to groups designated as terrorists by the State Department. The four types of support described are \\"training,\\" \\"expert advice or assistance,\\" \\"service,\\" and \\"personnel.\\" In June 2010, the United States Supreme Court upheld the law in an as-applied challenge in the case Holder v.

The Advocacy of Terrorism on the Internet: Freedom of Speech Issues and the Material Support Statutes . Washington, DC: Congressional Research Service, September 8, 2016.  Criticism  The material support provisions have been criticized by rights groups as violating the First Amendment, as they criminalize activities like the distribution of literature, engaging in political advocacy, participating in peace conferences, training in human rights advocacy, and donating money and humanitarian assistance, even when the support is intended only to promote lawful and non-violent activities. The provisions are vague and wide-ranging, and impose guilt by association by punishing people not for their own acts but for the acts of those they have supported. The Secretary of State's power to designate groups as terrorist has also been criticized as being too broad, giving the Executive too much discretionary power to label groups as \\"terrorist\\" and criminalize their supporters. The American Civil Liberties Union note that: \\"Federal 'material support' and conspiracy statutes allow the government to secure convictions without having to show that any specific act of terrorism has taken place, or is being planned, or even that a defendant intended to further terrorism.\\" David D. Cole, in his book Terrorism and the Constitution, stated that: Professor Jeanne Theoharis describes the measures in equally critical terms: US Senator Patrick Leahy sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton regarding humanitarian relief in Somalia in 2011. \\"I have long urged reform of our laws governing so-called material support for terrorism. The current law is so broad as to be unworkable. Aid workers trying to provide relief to starving Somalis fear they could be prosecuted if some of it were to end up in the hands of al-Shabab, an al-Qaeda affiliate that controls parts of Somalia. And so while the situation in Somalia grows more desperate each day, with children dying needlessly, the delivery of food and medicines is hampered, first by al- Shabab, which is denying access to broad swaths of Somali territory, and secondly, by our overly restrictive laws. The Secretary of State has the power to grant exemptions where the purpose is not to engage in terrorist activity. She should use that authority immediately to ensure aid can reach as many Somalis as possible.\\"  Implementation  The following people have been charged or convicted of providing material support for terrorism under this law. * David Hicks, a former Guantanamo detainee who pleaded guilty in 2007 and served a sentence of less than one year in Australia, before his case was thrown out as a court found the crime is not a war crime and cannot be tried by a military court. * John Walker Lindh, who was captured fighting for the Taliban during the Battle of Qala-i-Jangi, one of the first battles in the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan.

He had two spells in the Football League with Burnley in the late 19th century, as well as playing in the Scottish Football League with Clyde. He is notable for being the first ever Burnley player to score a hat- trick in a competitive match at Turf Moor, and actually scored the club's first four competitive hat-tricks at the ground. After retiring from football, he became a private in the British Army. Playing career Lambie began his footballing career in his native Glasgow in the latter part of the 1880s when he joined Glasgow Thistle, who at the time played in the Scottish Football Alliance. His performances and goalscoring for Thistle attracted clubs in the English Football League. In 1889, he was signed by Burnley. In his first season with the Clarets, Lambie played only seven times in the league, but scored five goals in this time. In the 1890‚Äì91 season he played 18 matches and scored 16 goals as the side finished eighth in the league. During this first spell at Burnley, he became the first-ever Burnley player to score a hat-trick in a competitive match at Turf Moor, in the 7‚Äì0 victory over Bolton Wanderers on 1 March 1890. He went on to score three more hat-tricks in the following season; one against Aston Villa in a 4‚Äì4 draw, and two hat-tricks against Derby County. In total he made 27 senior appearances for the Clarets, scoring on 22 occasions before he left the club in the summer of 1891. Upon leaving Burnley, Lambie moved back north to Scotland to join Scottish Football League outfit Clyde. He helped Clyde achieve an eighth-placed finish in the 1891‚Äì1892 campaign before briefly leaving football to join the Highland Light Infantry. He returned to Football League First Division Burnley in the 1892‚Äì93 season, but he only made four appearances in the league and did not manage to score. He left Burnley the same season and subsequently retired from football to rejoin the Army. Personal life Lambie was born in 1868 in Glasgow, Scotland. He was in the British Army with the Highland Light Infantry during the late 1890s. He left Britain for active service in South Africa before later returning to England. In July 1921, aged 53, his body was found on a railway line near Smethwick.

These methods are usually assisted by some sort of a discovery tool and are considered to be more intuitive. The tools that serve the associative browsing are similarity/relevancy tools. They use different algorithms to analyze the content and the user in order to offer him or direct him to the next link in what is considered his associative chain. One of the more familiar sites to use the associative browsing method was Pandora.com, the site used a relevancy engine to bring users music they would like according to the music they are listening right now. The site‚Äôs algorithm tried to forecast the next link (in this case a song) in the user‚Äôs associative chain. Associative browsing can be done without the discovery tools but due to the internet overload of information this can be done on a very thin surface line. For example, when you are looking at shoes on the Nike website you can type Puma.com and continue surfing associatively, but your intuitive recalling of shoes websites is limited and at some point you will be forced to perform a search. The difference between searching and associative browsing is in the \\"flow\\" of the events. While in associative browsing you are surfing from site to site following your associative chain, in search mode you are inquiring information which will help you develops an associative chain. The implementation of associative browsing can be on different levels and on different subjects. The discovery tools can try and guess the next link in your associative chain, the next song you will hear, the next site you will visit or the next product you will shop for.

Between mid-April 1942 and May 1943 he was in the Netherlands as a commander for the establishment of the Aufstellung von Freiwilligen-Verb√§nden der Waffen-SS (voluntary associations of the Waffen- SS). Appointment to Albania Albania during World War II From October 1943 to 1 January 1945 Fitzthum was appointed Special Representative of the Reichsf√ºhrer-SS by Heinrich Himmler to act as his personal plenipotentiary in Albania. As a former Vienna police chief Fitzthum's main stated task was to rebuild the Albanian police force. However he soon conceived the idea of raising an Albanian Legion as the Austrians had done here during World War I but within the Waffen SS. Consequently, from April to June 1944 Fitzthum organized the recruitment and training of the 21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg (1st Albanian). Inside Albanian wartime politics, he was a vocal opponent of collaborating with the Zogist / Royalist faction.Bernd J√ºrgen Fischer: Albania at War, 1939‚Äì1945. Purdue University Press, West Lafayette 1999, p. 212. An experienced political infighter, Fitzthum rapidly monopolized both the Reich powers in Albania (usurping even those of the German Foreign Ministry) and the local Albanian political systems of administration. In August 1944 he was promoted SS Gruppenf√ºhrer und Generalleutnant der Waffen-SS and granted very broad powers. In September 1944 he directly appointed a three-man \\"control committee\\" for Tirana including Preng√´ Previzi (an obscure collaborating politician), the formal head of the Albanian secret police under the Nazis, and General Gustav von Myrdacz (an Austrian military officer who had retired to Tirana after World War I). \\"Regular army officers decried Fitzthum's rash of arrests as well as the transporting of some 400 Albanian prisoners out of Albania, directly contravening existing agreements.\\".Bernd J√ºrgen Fischer: Albania at War, 1939‚Äì1945. Purdue University Press, West Lafayette 1999, p. 226. By 2 October 1944, when the Germans decided to formally evacuate Albania, Fitzthum was perhaps the most powerful man in the entire country. During the withdrawal, Fitzthum helped Xhafer Deva set up, arm and equip a local administration and defence force in Kosovo. Upon returning to the Third Reich he was posted to the 18th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division Horst Wessel as a commander from 3 to 10 January 1945, when Fitzthum was killed in a car accident in Wiener Neudorf. He was buried in Vienna. References Bibliography * Birn, Ruth Bettina (1986). Die H√∂heren SS- und Polizeif√ºhrer. Himmlers Vertreter im Reich und in den besetzten Gebieten.

It was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1988. The building was built as part of a major construction program after the School District of Philadelphia was reorganized and consolidated in 1905. Between 1906 and World War I, the district built 44 elementary schools, one junior high school, and five senior high schools. The architect of this program, Henry deCourcy Richards, used a number of plans in different architectural styles, such as Regency architecture, Colonial Revival, Georgian Revival, Classical Revival, Jacobethan, Mediterranean Revival, and Academic Gothic. In some cases, he built multiple schools from each pattern, but varying the ornamentation between individual buildings. The Thomas Durham School is one of his Regency designs. It was one of his plainest designs for the district, and also one of the cheapest to build. This may have resulted from its location in a predominantly African-American neighborhood. The Thomas Durham School building is now occupied by Independence Charter School.

Biography Celer was an Illyrian though nothing is known of his early life.; . In 503, Emperor Anastasius named him general in the ongoing war against the Sassanid Persians in the East.. In the spring of 504, he led his men to participate in the ongoing siege of Amida, but soon after left and engaged in an invasion of Persian-held territory, retaking several cities and returning with much booty. In late 504, Celer engaged in negotiations with the Persians, which resulted in a temporary truce.. In 505, he was again active on the eastern frontier, but is not reported to have engaged in major operations; he did, however, continue contacts with the Persians, ransoming Amida for 1,100 pounds of gold. In autumn 506, Celer led the Byzantine negotiations with the Persians at Dara, which resulted in the conclusion of a peace treaty. Perhaps as a reward, he was named consul for 508; he had already been appointed as magister officiorum sometime around 503 to 504.. In 511, Celer conspired with Emperor Anastasius in a plan to have the Patriarch of Constantinople, Macedonius, exiled by inducing Macedonius to sign a document that rejected the councils of Ephesus (431) and Chalcedon (451) and thus lose the support of the pro-Chalcedonian faction. Afterwards, Celer was ordered to ensure that Severus and his Monophysite monks were safely returned to their convents in Syria. In 512, Celer was sent to Constantinople, along with Patricius, to pacify the riotous Chalcedonian crowds, but ultimately failed.. Celer was still in office at the time of the ascension of Emperor Justin I (r. 518‚Äì527) on 9 July 518, but was soon after removed from office (his first recorded successor was Tatianus in 520 though Symmachus may have held the position in 519). Following that, he participated in the negotiations of 519‚Äì520 with the Patriarch of Rome to end the Acacian Schism. He is described by chroniclers as wise, well-educated, a capable administrator, and personally brave. The date or manner of his death is not recorded, save for a reference to it being \\"unfortunate\\".

He said he would only do so if he could work with all parties and that there would be no partisan political interference in his work, which they agreed. He was voted in as Governor by the Anbar Provincial Council 24-3 and formed an administration with all parties in the provincial council except the Iraqi Islamic Party which declined to join. Following his appointment, he condemned the \\"widely spread culture of corruption\\" that had developed and said he needed to \\"rebuild people's damaged morals\\".

Plot In the East Side Kids' clubhouse, Muggs McGinnis (Leo Gorcey) laments the epidemic of mugging that has been plaguing their streets. While waiting outside a store that afternoon, the boys witness a man being attacked in the alley and come to his defense, chasing away his assailants. In gratitude, the man, millionaire John Cortland (Herbert Heyes), hands Muggs his business card. When the cynical Muggs tosses the card in a garbage can, Glimpy McClosky (Huntz Hall) digs it out and finds the man's cash-laden wallet in the trash. After the boys deliver the wallet to Capt. Mathews (Noah Berry, Sr.) of the police department, the captain mistakes them for the thieves and arrests them. Cortland soon arrives at the police station to claim his wallet, however, and identifies the boys as his rescuers. Upon discovering that the boys long for a gymnasium, Cortland invites them to his house the next day. There, Cortland shows them his son John Jr.'s basement gymnasium, and after explaining that John is overseas fighting, he offers the boys the use of the facilities. Escorting the boys upstairs, Cortland introduces them to his pretty daughter Louise (Louie Currie) and his son Roy (Johnny Duncan), whose hand has been sprained. Noting Roy's injured hand, Muggs begins to suspect that he was involved in the robbery, but when Capt. Mathews asks for a description of the thieves, Muggs refuses to cooperate. Soon after, Louise's fianc√©, French soldier Lt. Andre Dupree (Stanley Brown), arrives, and Louise informs her father that all the servants have quit, thus jeopardizing a dinner party she had planned for that evening. Attracted to Louise, Muggs suggests that his mother (Mary Gordon) and Mrs. McClosky (Patsy Moran) would be happy to cook and serve for the party. When Muggs overhears Andre drop his French accent during a phone conversation, he begins to suspect that he is a phony and decides to follow him. Muggs and Glimpy trail Andre to the Zig Zag Club, where he meets his paramour, showgirl Maizie Dunbar (Iris Adrian). Deciding to tell Louise the truth about her fianc√©, Muggs and Glimpy return to the Cortland mansion, but Louise refuses to believe their story. Meanwhile, the other boys are walking past the neighborhood pool hall when they see Roy playing pool with two of the robbers. When Muggs returns to the clubhouse, the boys tell him about spotting Roy at the pool hall. Later that night, Muggs takes Maizie to the Cortland party, and when she sees Andre flirting with Louise, she jealously confronts him. After overhearing their heated conversation, Louise finally realizes that Andre is a gigolo and asks him to leave. Later, the doorbell rings, and when Muggs answers it, he is handed a telegram, notifying the Cortlands of John's death in combat. Summoning Cortland from the dinner table, Muggs gives him the bad news. Grief- stricken, Cortland faints and the boys carry him to his room. While upstairs, they sneak into Roy's room and find a cap worn by one of the robbers. Muggs vows to reform the boy, and after the party, the boys follow Roy to the pool hall. In the ensuing fight, Roy runs away and Muggs and the others chase him. During the m√™l√©e, the crooks capture Skinny (Billy Benedict) and take him hostage. When the boys catch Roy, Muggs challenges him to a boxing match to teach him a lesson. Hearing shouts coming from the gymnasium, Cortland goes to investigate and overhears Muggs interrogating Roy about the robbery. Soon after, Louise appears and announces that she has just received a phone call from Lefty (Gabriel Dell), one of the crooks, who is threatening to harm Skinny if Roy informs on him. Angered, Roy agrees to lead the boys to Lefty's hideout. Once there, a brawl ensues and Muggs sends Roy home to safety. After subduing the crooks, Muggs and the boys deliver them to Capt. Mathews at police headquarters. Soon after, Roy enters the captain's office and turns himself in. When Muggs eloquently defends Roy and pleads for leniency, the captain decides to release Roy and suggests that Muggs champion the boy's case in court. Just then, Cortland arrives and, after forgiving his son, offers Muggs and the boys his heartfelt thanks. Notes * Only East Side Kids film for Al Stone.

Biography Tova Diamond (later Sanhadray-Goldreich) was born in Ternopil in Galicia in Austria-Hungary (today in Ukraine). She became involved in Mizrachi and Hapoel HaMizrachi during her twenties, and helped establish Bnot Mizrachi.Tova Sanhadray- Goldreich Jewish Women's Archive She also taught Hebrew. She made aliyah from Poland to Mandatory Palestine in 1934 and initially lived in Tel Aviv. In 1935 she helped establish the Hapoel HaMizrachi Women Workers organisation, and the following year was elected its secretary general, heading the movement for the next fifty years. In the same year she married Rabbi Yisrael Sanhadray. After his death in 1966 she married Rabbi Kalman Goldreich. Political career Prior to the 1949 Knesset elections, the ultra-Orthodox parties, Agudat Yisrael and Poalei Agudat Yisrael formed an alliance (named the United Religious Front) with Mizrachi and Hapoel HaMizrachi, with the condition that no women would be on the alliance's list. In protest, Sanhadray formed a new list, Working and Religious Women, which ran in the election. However, it won only 0.6% of the vote, failing to cross the 1% electoral threshold. In elections in 1951 and 1955 Sanhadray was given an unrealistic place on the Hapoel HaMizrachi and National Religious Party (NRP) lists. However, she entered the Knesset after the 1959 elections, becoming the first woman to represent the NRP. She was re-elected in 1961, 1965 and 1969. In 1963 she was appointed Deputy Speaker, a role she retained until she lost her seat in the 1973 elections. She died in 1993 at the age of 86.

She was renowned for bringing to her performances a rhythmic drive and excitement while allowing the instrument to sing, with extraordinary seamless and legato lines and expressive phrasing. During her performing career she made many public appearances, in the UK, continental Europe (Vienna, Geneva etc.), and her native South Africa. She was acclaimed for a wide-ranging repertoire that included B√∂hm, Rameau, Fran√ßois Couperin, Scarlatti and Handel, but she was praised above all for her playing of J. S. Bach and his six Partitas for solo harpsichord. At her debut in March 1972 she was hailed by the Daily Telegraph as \\"A mind that both contemplates and acts on intimate stylistic knowledge.\\" Her Bach recording for Saga was reviewed in Records & Recording by John Duarte (March 1976) who wrote, \\"It is in the Partita in B minor that her playing reaches the proportions of grandeur. There is much to admire in de la Porte's playing, but above all its through line and motivation; she plays as a good orator speaks, and it would be a poor student who could not add to a score the long phrasing marks implied by these performances. It is not just that she sees the end of long phrases and sections from their outset; she carries you in one sweep from beginning to end; it's the wholeness of the music that she communicates, and the joy of it.\\" Elizabeth de la Porte was born at Johannesburg in South Africa on 15 September 1941, the daughter of William James Tomlinson and his wife, the singer Betsy de la Porte. For her schooling she attended Kingsmead College in Johannesburg. For her piano studies she went to Adolph Hallis, and for Bach and for theory to Stefan Zondagh. She was in her mid-teens when she played the Tchaikovsky First Piano Concerto for a South African radio broadcast; however her strongest affinities always lay with J. S. Bach. When she won the University of South Africa's Overseas Scholarship it was for her piano performance of Bach's C minor Partita. leftThis scholarship led to three years at Vienna (the Vienna Academy) where her principal teachers were Josef Dichler and Hilde Langer-R√ºhl. In Vienna she became properly acquainted with the harpsichord and the influence of Nikolaus Harnoncourt who was currently establishing the Concentus Musicus Wien. She went on to the Royal College of Music London where her teachers included Kendall Taylor (piano) and Thornton Lofthouse (harpsichord). She now resolved to concentrate on the harpsichord, and she extended her studies further with Jane Clark and Rafael Puyana. She made her harpsichord debut at the Purcell Room in London (February 1972), going on to perform all Bach‚Äôs French Suites at a special series at St. John‚Äôs Smith Square in London, and managing something remarkable for the 1970s with an all Couperin recital that sold out the Purcell Room. She made several appearances on BBC Television, and her first record (Vinyl-disc) was the ‚ÄúElizabeth de la Porte Collection‚Äù for Ted Perry, then at Saga Records. He and Saga also issued her famous record of Bach‚Äôs Italian Concerto and French Overture (B minor Partita), together with the Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue. Her set of the six Partitas were subsequently put out by Ted Perry after he had gone on to found Hyperion. Stanley Sadie, Editor in Chief of the New Grove, described this in Gramophone (April 1983) as \\"A very fine recording of the harpsichord partitas by Elizabeth de la Porte, which shows the breadth of range of these supreme examples of the Baroque harpsichord suite.\\" All these Bach recordings of works by Johann Sebastian Bach have recently been re- released by London Independent Records, now London Independent Classics, director Jan Hart. Prof Piet de Villiers helped her a few times during her career to achieve bigger heights. RCM President HRH Prince Charles, The Prince of Wales. Photo: Chris Christodoulou Health difficulties resulted in her early retirement from public performance, but in July 2003 she made a rare return, joining her son and his Baroque Group Extraordinaire for Bach's C major Two-Harpsichord Concerto at St Sepulchre's Church in the City of London. She continued taking great pleasure in her teaching. She taught at the London Royal College of Music Junior Department for 55 years (its longest-serving member of staff to date), which she found particularly rewarding and where she cofounded Baroque ensemble tutored groups in addition to individual teaching. Latterly she also taught at St Edmund‚Äôs, Kent College and the Junior King‚Äôs School, both at Canterbury near her home in Faversham in East Kent. In 2016, she was made a Fellow of the Royal College of Music in recognition of her services to music and music education. She married Dr Paul Dawson-Bowling in 1966, and they had three children. She died on 9 April 2020.

Stahel (born June 5, 1946) is a Swiss architect, graduating from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Z√ºrich in 1971. He has been influential in developing the field of sustainability, by advocating 'service-life extension of goods - reuse, repair, remanufacture, upgrade technologically' philosophies as they apply to industrialised economies. He co-founded the Product Life Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, a consultancy devoted to developing sustainable strategies and policies, after receiving recognition for his prize winning paper 'The Product Life Factor' in 1982. His ideas and those of similar theorists led to what is now known as the circular economy in which industry adopts the reuse and service-life extension of goods as a strategy of waste prevention, regional job creation and resource efficiency in order to decouple wealth from resource consumption, that is to dematerialise the industrial economy. The circular economy has been adopted by the state- owned-and-run China Coal industry as a guiding philosophy.China Daily http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2010-11/17/content_11565512.htm In the 1990s, Stahel extended this vision to selling goods as services as the most efficient strategy of the circular economy. He described this approach in his 2006 book The Performance Economy, with a second enlarged edition in 2010 which contains 300 examples and case studies. he currently works closely with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation on further promoting his ideas with economic actors. In 2005, Stahel was nominated as member of the \\"Consumer Commission\\" of Ministerprasident (PM) Oettinger, head of the Government of Baden- Wuerttemberg, Germany, and heads its section on sustainable development. In 2007 he was appointed to the Editorial Board of the Chinese Journal of Population, Resources and Environment. Stahel has been serving in a number of functions for the European Commission. From 1988 to 2014, he was Head of Risk Management Research of The Geneva Association, a think-tank of the world insurance industry. In 2005, Stahel was nominated Visiting Professor at the Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences of the University of Surrey at Guildford. On 1 November 2012, he was awarded an honorary degree award of Doctor of the University (DUniv) by the same university. Later in November 2012, Stahel was nominated Full Member of the Club of Rome, based in Winterthur. In 2016, he was nominated as the first Visiting Professor of Institut EDDEC (Environnement, D√©veloppement Durable et Economie Circulaire), a joint academic institution of Universit√©, HEC and Polytechnique de Montr√©al. On 3 May 2016, he was awarded a Doctorate honoris causa by the Universit√© de Montr√©al. Substituting manpower for energy, 1976 While employing somewhat jargon-laden and difficult economic language, Stahel and Genevieve Reday's 1976 report Potential for Substitution Manpower for Energy for Commission of the European Communities (today the European Commission) essentially put the argument of extending the service-life of buildings and such goods as cars and highlighted the waste inherent of disposing of old products Instead of repairing them.About the Product Life Institute The report was published in 1982 as a book 'Jobs for Tomorrow, the Potential for Substituting Manpower for Energy'.Cradle-to-cradle [Product Life dot Org http://www.product- life.org/en/cradle-to-cradle] The Limits to Certainty, 1989 The Limits to Certainty by Orio Giarini and Walter R. StahelThe Limits to Certainty https://books.google.com/books?id=Mqv0y14orb0C&printsec;=frontcover#v=onepage&q;&f;=true is a 1989 follow-up to a report published by the Club of Rome in 1980, Dialogue on Wealth and Welfare, in which it was proposed the generally recognised limits to growth such as finite raw materials were the limits of a specific type of economic growth, a linear rather than circular industrial economy. Stahel advocates making a better use of resources during the utilization of goods and proposes a new type of economic growth taking into account ecological factors. Updates in the 1993 edition arise mainly from work done at the Product Life Institute founded by Orio Giarini and Walter R. Stahel in Geneva in 1982. The Product-Life Factor, 1982 In 1982, Stahel won a Mitchell Prize for his paper ‚ÄúThe Product-Life Factor‚Äù describing the closed loop economy, now referred to as the circular economy. Stahel's paper suggested extension of the use-life of goods was a sensible point at which to start a gradual transition towards a sustainable society. He argued extending product-life optimizes the total life-span of goods and reduces depletion of natural resources and consequently waste. The Product Life Institute, 1982 Also in 1982 Stahel, with Giarini, founded the Product-Life Institute to develop practical strategies for economic growth with lower resource consumption. The Product-Life Institute is a not-for-profit organization in Geneva, Switzerland. The Institute promotes what has become known as the loop or circular economy, the key attributes being product-life extension, long- life goods, reconditioning activities and therefore waste minimisation. The Institute argues a sustainable economy and society recognizes the primacy of ecosystem services provided by the natural environment. This position inherently opposes any form of pollution. The Geneva Association, 1986 to 2014 Since 1986, Stahel has been in charge of The Geneva Association's Research Programme on Risk Management and responsible for the M.O.R.E. seminar series (Managing Risk in the Economy). In 2012 he was Vice-Secretary General and Director of risk management research, Visiting Professor at the Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences, University of Surrey; and Guest Lecturer at Tohoku University, Japan, on business models for sustainable development. In June 2008, Stahel took charge of The Geneva Association's Climate Change and Insurance Project. End of December 2014, Stahel retired from the Geneva Association to focus on his activities promoting the Circular Economy and Performance Economy, through lectures and publications, as Director of the Product-Life Institute, Geneva. Publications Publications include The Performance Economy, 2006, published by Palgrave Macmillan, London (a second revised and enlarged edition was published in March 2010), The Limits to Certainty, Facing Risk in the New Service Economy, 1989/92, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht (co-author Orio Giarini); a number of book chapters in edited volumes and several research reports available on the websites of both The Geneva Association and The Product Life Institute.

It has 931 students. The current headteacher is Mr Woodcock. In 2018, the school was awarded a 'worst school' Ofsted inspection rating. History The school opened on its present site in 1957 as East Bergholt Modern School. It replaced a Victorian-built school at Burnt Oak, East Bergholt, at the junction of Flatford Road and White Horse Road. East Bergholt Modern School took children aged 11‚Äì16 from East Bergholt and surrounding villages, including Brantham, Bentley, Capel St Mary, Copdock, Washbrook, Raydon and Holton St Mary. Many of these villages had their own primary schools. These children would have not passed the 11+ examination or chose not to attend a higher school after passing it. The school's focus at the time was on technical rather than academic ability, with a leaning towards rural and domestic science. The original school building, which is still in use, has a hall, library, kitchens and about ten classrooms. Originally, two of these were specially equipped for cookery/needlework and science/rural science. A second building opened in 1971, with a ceremony performed by Margaret Thatcher, then education minister. This building was largely open-plan with the exception of the music and art/craft rooms. A new science section on the northern side of the first floor had three rooms, again open-plan. The school roll at the time was 350. A sports hall opened at the same time. Between 1972-75, a campaign led by villager Jan Watts led to an open-air heated swimming pool being built to the north of the sports hall. The sports hall was extended in 1997, and its facilities, including a fitness studio, gym, hard courts and grass pitches, are shared with the community.http://www.eastbergholtsportscentre.co.uk/ The school has of grounds which included a youth club to the west of the original school and a caretaker's house on the frontage. The original tennis courts at the front of the school are now a car park, and new sports courts have been built on the east of the site. In the late 1970s, the school became a comprehensive (taking children of all abilities) and changed its name from \\"modern school\\" to \\"high school\\". It became a specialist science college in 2004, and was designated a high-performing specialist school in 2009. As of 2010, its catchment area remains the same as it was in the 1950s, although the school's reputation for academic achievement has led to children from north Colchester and Manningtree choosing to go there. Also as of 2010 the school has consisted of four blocks as the swimming pool was filled in and was turned into an extra playground and \\"D block\\". The school's original building is called \\"A block\\" and consists of the hall, canteen, 18 classrooms one containing kitchen facilities, music practice rooms and small offices. The second block to be built was \\"B block\\". It consists of a library, the school's office, 13 classrooms including science labs and ICT suits.\\"C block\\" has 12 classrooms including science labs ICT suites and technology rooms. The newest \\"D block\\" has 3 classrooms and small examination room used for language GCSE speaking exams. During 2013 work began on the extension of the original dining hall which has made extra room for eating areas. In 2017 A Block was extended with an extra multi-use space which can be divided into two rooms. Solar panels have also been put on top of B Block roof. School badges The school's first badge showed a lamb; this sought to maintain a connection with East Bergholt's first school, opened in 1594 by the lawyer Edward Lambe, and intended \\"for the instruction of poor boys\\". The Lambe School building still stands in The Street, and is used as a community hall. The current badge is a \\"shark's fin\\" of three blue stripes. People of note Zoe Newson, student of 2008, is a British powerlifter who in 2012 posted a European record at the IPC Powerlifting British Championships. She took bronze in the under-40 kg class for Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London. Neil Head, student of 1976, was the first person to race three Huskies from east to west Alaska within a week. He holds the world record to this day. The schools music teacher in the 1970s, Geoff Hannant, was the organist for the 1973 wedding at Westminster Abbey of The Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips. Hannant went on to record Twelve East Anglian Organs.  Notability  In June 2018, 4 Year 10 Students designed mural boards designed to protect the new war memorial built in Capel St Mary to mark the 100th anniversary of the World War One. The boards have been commended by the current South Suffolk MP, James Cartilidge and were officially removed on 11 November 2018 to reveal the memorial. During 2018, RAF reserve Group Captain, Gary Bunkell sent a letter regarding the project to the Queen and received a response praising the students of the school for their commitments to the project.

As the Industrial Revolution began to take hold in the Forest of Dean, the Crown resolved to dilute the Foresters‚Äô freemining rights and introduce free-market forces to the area. Then, in 1808, Parliament directed that large areas of the Forest be enclosed, in order to satisfy an increased demand for naval timber. Unable to compete with the outside industrialists, and denied their ancient rights to collect timber or graze animals in the enclosed areas, many Foresters descended into abject poverty. Unrest grew and Warren James emerged as a populist leader. In 1831 he led a group of up to 3000 Foresters in open revolt against the Crown, tearing down around 60 miles of fencing in an attempt to retake possession of the enclosures. Warren James was tried and sentenced to death, though this was commuted to transportation to Tasmania. He was pardoned five years later, but unable to return home, he died in Hobart in 1841. His actions have inspired many other campaigns over the years and he remains one of the most significant figures in Forest of Dean history. Early life James' father, also Warren James (1751‚Äì1809), married Ann Kear (1755‚Äì1836) in 1777. At first they lived in a rented cottage in Bream, but in 1782 they moved to an encroachment cottage, which they had built on land between Parkend and Whitecroft.Anstis, Ralph. Warren James and the Dean Forest Riots. p24/25 A map dated 1787Anstis, Ralph. The Story of Parkend (1998). p18 shows the family house as being on the southern edge of Parkend, and describes it as a 'Turf' cottage, built on encroached land, and valued by the Crown at 15 shillings per year. Warren James (the younger) was born in July 1792, and was baptised at Bream Chapel on 29 July 1792. He was the fourth son, and sixth born, of nine children. The younger James appears to have had no formal education, although later documents show that he could read and write as an adult. Along with his six brothers, he followed his father to become a miner at an early age. Little is known of his family life, though the family were undoubtedly impoverished. Encroachment cottages were illegally built single storey, built of loose stones and covered with turf. They had no windows, only a low door, a crude fireplace with chimney, and a floor paved with stones.Anstis, Ralph. Warren James and the Dean Forest Riots. p20 The constant threat was that the authorities could destroy their home and remove them from the land. James' house was destroyed and the family removed from the land in 1813, the land being forested after the removal. Aged 20 or 21, James moved with his mother to Bream. He never married. Background to the Dean Forest Riots The Forest of Dean is home to a range of natural resources, primarily timber, coal and iron ore. These had been exploited on a small scale since before Roman times, but the possibilities of large scale extraction had not escaped the attention of the Crown. Free-mining rights had been granted to foresters at least as far back as 1244, but there had been a long tradition of disputes between the Crown and foresters over these rights. In 1612 the Earl of Pembroke attempted to enclose extensive areas of forest. In an effort to preserve their rights, the foresters took him to the Exchequer Court and won. There had also been previous riots, such as those which took place in 1631 when Sir Giles Mompesson built three new coal mines.Wright, Ian. The life and Times of Warren James (2008). p5/6 As the Industrial Revolution began to take hold, the Crown became more determined than ever to introduce the free market into the forest, and with it the right of outside industrialists to own land and mineral rights. They began by outlawing the Mine Law Court in 1777, and physically destroying the Mine Law documents which constituted the laws by which the forest miners governed themselves. Soon industrialists from outside the area began opening large iron and coal mines. The Free Miners found it difficult to compete with these and often ended up working as waged labourers for the new owners. In 1808, Parliament passed the Dean Forest (Timber) Act in response to a severe shortage of naval timber. The act included the provision to enclose 11,000 acres (4,452 ha) of the forest. Responsibility for the execution of this part of the Act fell to a young, newly appointed deputy surveyor named Edward Machen. He established his office at Whitemead Park, in Parkend, and in 1814 he enclosed and replanted Nagshead, the main woodland of Parkend. By 1816 all had been enclosed. Ordinary foresters were already poverty stricken, but now their plight had grown worse. They were denied access to the enclosed areas and so were unable to hunt in them or remove timber. In particular, they lost their ancient grazing and mining rights. Unrest was growing, but at first there was no organised resistance as the foresters had been told that the fences would be removed after 20 years, once the oaks were mature enough to withstand grazing. In 1828 and 1829, the Foresters petitioned to have the fences removed, but were turned down. In 1830 the 'Committee of Free Miners' chose Warren James to petition the Chief Commissioner and others in London. A petition from James, opposing the commission's parliamentary bill, was presented to the House of Commons on 11 June 1830, but foundered. Warren James' notice to the Free Miners After further efforts to have the fences removed failed, James finally called the Free Miners to action. A notice, dated 3 June 1831, was distributed and instructed Free Miners to meet on the following Wednesday \\"for the purpose of opening the Forest\\". James and Machen knew each other well, as both were regular churchgoers at Parkend. On Sunday 4 June they held a public meeting outside the church gates in Parkend. It was a final attempt to resolve the matter peaceably, but they could agree on nothing. The date given on the notice is \\"Meet on Wednesday next the 7th instant for the purpose of Opening the Forest....\\" Wednesday was in fact the 8th, but the wording may only be confusing in the context of modern-day interpretation. In any case, it was on the 8th that they met. The riots Machen confronted James at Park Hill enclosure, between Parkend and Bream, but James, who was leading a group of over 100 foresters, proceeded to demolish the fences there. Machen, and about 50 unarmed Crown Officers, were powerless to intervene. He returned to Parkend and sent for troops. On the Friday, a party of 50 soldiers arrived from Monmouth, but by now the number of Foresters had grown to over 2,000 and the soldiers returned to their barracks. By Saturday night, there was scarcely a mile of unbroken fence in the forest, but the next day a squadron of heavily armed soldiers arrived from Doncaster and the day after, another 180 infantrymen arrived from Plymouth. The Foresters' resistance soon crumbled. Most melted away into the forest and returned home. Warren James was arrested, and committed to trial at Gloucester Assizes on Monday, 13 August 1831. Trial of Warren James Coleford. Machen was the first, and chief witness at the trial. He spoke about the notice James had issued, and how he had, in turn issued his own notice cautioning that such action was illegal. He referred to his meeting with James, on the Sunday, and said that James had claimed possession of a document which proved the enclosures were unlawful. Machen went on to say that, on Wednesday morning (the day of the riot) he had gone to James' house in the morning, asking him to produce the document. James replied that it was in his house and said he would fetch it \\"and in a minute or two returned, with a pick axe on his shoulder.\\" Machen then described how he and another magistrate had followed James to the enclosure at Park Hill, how he had warned him again, how James had made the first 'blow', and how he (Machen) had eventually read the riot act. After listening to several more witnesses, the jury found James guilty of felony under the Riot Act, but made a plea for clemency on the grounds of his previous good character. The judge, Mr Justice Patteson, sentenced James to death, but within two weeks this was commuted to transportation for life.Account of the trial; Gloucester Journal, 20 August 1831] James was sent to Van Diemen‚Äôs Land, modern day Tasmania. Of the others who were arrested, one other was also sentenced to death, but this too was later commuted to transportation. Nine people were sentenced to imprisonment, for periods of up to two years, and several others received smaller sentences or fines. Around a hundred others elected to voluntarily rebuild the enclosures, rather than be charged with rioting. Time in Australia The conditions on transport ships were notoriously bad and convicts frequently died en route. James arrived in Tasmania on 14 February 1832, and was assigned to a working party attached to the Public Works Department in Hobart. It seems that he kept his head down for four years, but on 19 January 1836, he was sentenced to a week's imprisonment for 'neglect of duty and insolence to a magistrate'. Then on 24 February 1836, he was sentenced to thirty six lashes and sent to work in a coal mine near Port Arthur, for 'gross contempt towards the commandant when addressing the prisoners'. Meanwhile, back in the Forest of Dean, the foresters, supported by Machen, had been petitioning for his pardon. This was granted on 16 February 1836, but didn't reach (or wasn't granted to) James until 13 September, and was given without free passage home. James decided to stay in Van Diemen's Land, though his reasons are unknown. Certainly he would have been unable to pay for the passage without assistance, and by now he was also in poor health. It also seems that he had cut himself off from his family and friends, as he apparently had no contact with them since leaving England. James died in rented rooms in Argyll Street, Hobart, on 26 October 1841. A moving account of his last few days was given by his landlord, William Overell, at the inquest. In it he describes James' terrible condition and how he had refused medical attention. The coroner recorded the death as being due to \\"Atrophy of the belly\\" and \\"very acute inflammation of the liver\\". Physical appearance No photographs of James exist, but the following description of him, aged around 40, is given on a prison document: Stylised mural of Warren James at The Fountain Inn, Parkend. Height - 5feet 3 inches Complexion - dark Head - round Hair/Whiskers - black to grey Visage - oval Forehead - long, sloping back Eyebrows - brown Eyes - hazel Nose - sharp Mouth - large Chin - medium Remarks - stout Although conjecture, he may also have looked young for his age, as the same document describes him as being 30 on arrival in Tasmania, when he was in fact 40.

Though Kai √ñist√§m√∂, Nokia's executive vice-president for devices, has said the Booklet is \\"a natural evolution for us,\\" Stephen Williams from The New York Times says it is \\"more of a homecoming\\" because of Nokia's prior computer business. Nokia's expansion into the netbook market is contrary to computer maker Apple's 2007 expansion into the phone market with their iPhone. Nokia announced the device in August 2009. The price was announced to be ‚Ç¨575 before tax, making it one of the higher-priced netbooks available. Design and technology Following the defence of the original netBook trademark by long-term partner company Psion the previous year, Nokia described the Booklet 3G as a \\"mini-laptop\\", although it was widely described as a netbook by others. It is thick and weighs , is cased in an aluminium shell, and has been said to resemble a MacBook. Its glossy display measures diagonally, and supports high-definition video. The Booklet uses an Intel Atom Z530 processor to run the Microsoft Windows 7 operating system. Nokia says that the battery will last up to 12 hours per charge. The Booklet supports network connections through Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and 3G/HSPA. It also offers telecommunications support via SIM card, has a built-in A-GPS receiver and accelerometer, and includes Nokia's Ovi Maps service. The integrated Intel GMA 500 graphic system is poorly supported by the Linux distributions, since the drivers for it are proprietary software.

In the former sense, it was often applied to military saints, such as Theodore Stratelates. In the late Roman/early Byzantine Empire, the title was used, along with the old-established stratƒìgos, to translate into Greek the office of magister militum (\\"master of the soldiers\\").. In the 6th century, however, Novel 90 of Emperor Justinian I () attests the existence of a middle-ranking honorific title of stratƒìlatƒìs, which ranked alongside the apo eparch≈çn (\\"former prefect\\"). A pr≈çtostratƒìlatƒìs (\\"first stratƒìlatƒìs\\") Theopemptos is attested in a 7th-century seal, likely indicating the senior-most dignitary among the entire class of the stratƒìlatai. This stratƒìlasia was a purely honorary dignity, attached to no office, and declined measurably in prestige during the 7th and 8th centuries: sigillographic evidence shows that it came to be held by the lower rung of the imperial bureaucracy, such as kommerkiarioi (customs supervisors), kouratores (supervisors of imperial establishments) and notarioi (imperial secretaries). By the late 9th century, it ranked at the bottom of the hierarchy of imperial dignities (along with the apo eparch≈çn), as attested in the 899 Klƒìtorologion of Philotheos. The Klƒìtorologion also records that the dignity was conferred by the award of a codicil or diploma (Greek: œáŒ¨œÅœÑŒ∑œÇ), retaining 6th-century practice. In the 10th-11th centuries, the term returned to its original military meaning, being used for senior generals, including the commanders-in-chief (the Domestics of the Schools) of East and West. At the same time, however, the presence of a tagma (professional standing regiment) called the Stratƒìlatai is attested in Asia Minor in the late 10th century, formed by Emperor John I Tzimiskes ().

Karimov received many honorary titles and awards, including the title People's Artist of the Uzbek SSR (1990) and the Order of People's Honor (1999).  Life and work  Ergash Karimovich Karimov was born on October 26, 1935. He graduated from the Tashkent Institute of Arts in 1958. That same year he started working at the Surkhandarya Theater. Later he worked as assistant director, director, and creative director at the Yoshlik TV Studio of the Uzbekistan Broadcasting Company. Karimov was married to actress Rozaxon Karimova. Karimov is best known for his roles in the 1972 Uzbek sketch comedy Uchrashuv. In one of the segments of the film, Karimov portrays a naive chemistry student who is not able to decipher the chemical formula for water. Karimov's character concludes that there are no atoms in water, as they could be used to create a bomb. Karimov is also known for his portrayal of a dishonest religious man in the highly acclaimed Uzbek adventure film Shum bola. Karimov remained largely unemployed after Uzbekistan became independent following the break-up of the Soviet Union. He lived in Tashkent with little income during the last few years of his life, according to Uzbek film director and producer Ali Hamroyev. Karimov died on August 4, 2009, at his home in Tashkent at the age of 73. He was no relation to Islam Karimov, the current President of Uzbekistan. Uzbekistan's state controlled media, which is heavily censored, did not report on Karimov's death.

Texas, Brooklyn & Heaven is a 1948 American black-and-white romantic comedy film directed by William Castle and starring Guy Madison, Diana Lynn, James Dunn, and Florence Bates. A reporter in Dallas, Texas, goes to New York with the dream of becoming a playwright. En route, he picks up a hitchhiker who wants to visit Brooklyn and live with horses. The two encounter a variety of zany characters living in Brooklyn before returning to Texas together to live on a horse ranch. The script was based on the best-selling 1943 novel Eddie and The Archangel Mike by Barry Benefield.  Plot  Mike, a bartender at the Texas Golden Horse bar in Brooklyn, narrates the story of Eddie Tayloe to a new customer. Eddie was working as a reporter assigned to the Ft. Worth desk of a Dallas newspaper. As the two neighboring cities were feuding, he has nothing to do. He dreams of becoming a playwright in New York City, and a small inheritance from his grandfather gives him his chance. Quitting his job, he begins the long drive to New York. When his car breaks down, he meets Perry Dunklin, who is hitchhiking with her suitcases. She helps him fix the car, having picked up the skill working with her brother in a gas station, and she joins him for the trip to New York. At first Eddie is wary of her, but the more time they spend together, the more interested he becomes in her. Perry warns him, though, not to fall in love with her. Perry says goodbye in Brooklyn and goes off to realize her dream of living with horses, but Eddie can't forget her. He finishes writing his play and goes around showing it to agents, but no one wants it. Perry, meanwhile, is traveling on a train when Mandy, an older woman with a criminal record for larceny, tries to pinch her wallet. Perry traps her in the act and Mandy faints. When the police arrive, Perry feels sorry for Mandy and claims she is her mother. The two move in together to an empty stable behind the Cheever house in Flatbush, owned by three morose spinsters. Perry tells the Cheever sisters that Mandy is Eddie's mother, too. When Perry finds a job working for a girlie show in Coney Island, Mandy takes Eddie to see what she's doing and he is upset at how men are ogling her. He confides his woes to Mike over a few shots of Mike's original alcoholic concoction. Afterwards, Mike treats his hangover with some fresh air in Prospect Park and a trip to a Turkish bath, and then introduces Eddie to Mr. Gaboolian, owner of a \\"riding academy\\" of mechanical animals, including two horses, a camel, and an elephant, which has only two regular customers. Knowing Perry's love of horses, Eddie pays Mr. Gaboolian to hire Perry, but although she tries to apply her business skills to improve the place, business remains bad. Eddie buys the business with his last $800 so Perry will still have a job running it. On Christmas Eve, a group of Santa Clauses converge on the academy at midnight to avoid going home, and Eddie sees an opportunity for publicity. He calls all the newspapers, who send photographers. Mandy and the Cheever sisters come too, and soon all are drinking liquor and riding the horses. Suddenly the electricity goes haywire and all the mechanical animals speed up and break apart. Nevertheless, the Cheever sisters have a wonderful time, and offer to buy the place. Eddie and Perry return to Texas and buy a horse ranch, where they live happily ever after.

Critic Don Graham notes that a poll taken in the early 1940s indicated that Texas, Brooklyn, and Heaven were the places that had the biggest box-office appeal; he opines that the screenplay was therefore crafted around the title concept. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Benefield's novel was re-titled Texas, Brooklyn & Heaven when it was reissued after the film's release. This was director William Castle's first comedy film. Jordan notes that many elements of the characters' lives parallel Castle's own life experiences. Casting The two lead actors, Guy Madison and Diana Lynn, received top billing over the title. A special note in the opening credits states: \\"Mr. Guy Madison appears by arrangement with David O. Selznick\\". The film marked the second screen appearance for Audie Murphy, who has a bit part as a copy boy. Murphy received $500 for the part and was allowed to keep four shirts that he wore for a promotional ad. Director Castle had a cameo as the newspaper's drama editor, who calls out \\"Boy!\\" to hand his story over to Murphy. Music Ervin Drake and Jimmy Shirl wrote the music and lyrics for the title song, \\"Texas, Brooklyn & Heaven\\". Filming Filming took place from mid-January to mid- February 1948. Graham notes that the establishing shots of downtown Dallas in the beginning of the film include a view of the Texas School Book Depository in Dealey Plaza, which later played an infamous role in the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy. Release Texas, Brooklyn & Heaven was released on July 16, 1948. Although it was copyrighted with a runtime of 89 minutes, the film was cut down to 76 minutes for its release. It was released in Great Britain under the title The Girl from Texas. A month before the Brooklyn premiere on October 1, United Artists held a beauty contest during the Coney Island Mardi Gras, with the winner being named \\"Most Heavenly Miss\\". The Brooklyn premiere of the film included a stage program in which James Dunn, himself a Brooklyn native, presented prizes to two young women chosen as \\"Most Heavenly Misses from Brooklyn\\" and a third winner of \\"Most Heavenly Miss\\" from Texas. Critical reception The film was poorly received by critics, who called it lightweight and nonsensical in parts. Variety described the film as \\"rambling\\", having \\"neither plot nor point. Story begins uncertainly, proceeds aimlessly and ends abruptly\\". This review surmised that the runtime had to be cut to fit the requirements of a double-bill feature, but poor editing left some scenes \\"dangling in the middle, wholly unexplained\\". While Madison was described as \\"pleasant\\" and Lynn as \\"likable\\", Variety cited the best performances as those of Lionel Stander as the bellhop and Florence Bates as the pickpocket. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram agreed that \\"Florence Bates as a frowzy pickpocket steals the show\\". Madison himself acknowledged that character actors Stander, Dunn, and Michael Chekhov were \\"holding the picture together. They have an uncanny sense of timing and instinct as to just how a scene should be played. It's going to take me a long time to come anywhere near that score\\", added Madison, who was signed by David O. Selznick on the basis of his good looks rather than his acting ability. The New York Daily News disliked the film for its clich√©d plot points and poor acting on the part of the leads. While acknowledging Madison as handsome and Lynn as cute, The Gazette review concludes that this is \\"[a] movie that won't make you too unhappy either to see or to miss\\". A modern review by AllMovie contends that the film \\"tries hard for zaniness, but the result at best is silliness and all too often is simply dull\\". It blames the script for being \\"random and haphazard\\", and for creating \\"pretty stock characters in pretty stock situations spouting stock words and phrases\\". This review also calls Madison's performance \\"fairly wooden\\", but commends Lynn for doing her best with her role.

It splits and straightens the flax fibers, as well as removes the fibrous core and impurities.\\"Heckle.\\" The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. Flax is pulled through heckling combs, which parts the locked fibers and makes them straight, clean, and ready to spin. Extract After heckling and spinning, flax is ready to be woven into linen. Process of heckling A hatchel, also known as a heckling comb, from Minnesota. Dressing is the broad term referring to removing the fibers from the straw and cleaning it enough to be spun. Dressing consists of three steps: breaking, scutching and heckling. After breaking, some of the straw is scraped from the fibers in the scutching process, then the fiber is pulled through various sized heckling combs, or hackles.oxforddictionaries.com definition of \\"hackle\\" Different sized heckling combs are used, progressing from coarser combs with only a few prongs or nails per inch, to finer combs. Generally three heckling combs are used; however, many more can be used. The finer the final heckling comb, the finer the yarn spun from that flax can be. An example of a progression of five combs is first using a heckling comb with four nails per square inch, then one with 12 per inch, then 25, next 48, and finally 80 nails per inch. The first three remove the straw, and the last two split and polish the fibers. The shorter fibers that remain in the heckling comb after the flax has been combed are called tow. If the heckle is fine enough, the tow can be carded like wool and spun, otherwise it can be spun like the other flax fibers. Tow produces a coarser yarn than the fibers pulled through the heckles because it will still have some straw in it. While this yarn is not suitable for fine linens, it can be used for bagging, rough sheets, cords or ropes. Heckling was originally done by hand, but began in the nineteenth century to be undertaken mechanically, with rollers drawing the slivers of flax through the hackles. The machine used for this is called a gill.\\"gill, n.8.\\" OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2016. Web. 26 September 2016. At first this was similar in form to traditional hackles, but later the screw- gill was invented.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 7th edn (1842), s.v. spinning. Key innovators in developing this technology were Philippe de Girard, Samuel Lawson (inventor of the screw-gill), and Peter Fairbairn.E. J. Connell and M. Ward, 'Industrial Development, 1780-1914', in A History of Modern Leeds, ed. by Derek Fraser (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1980), pp. 142-76 (at 157). Etymology A hackle or heckle The noun \\"heckle\\" is thought to be derived from Old English, with Middle English forms hechele, hetchell (c1300), hekele (c1440), hakell (1485), and later hatchel. The terms \\"heckle,\\" \\"hackle\\" and \\"hackel\\" are used interchangeably at present. In popular culture Prior to the industry becoming mechanised and moving to East Ulster, hackling was a rural based cottage industry with Cootehill in Ireland as Ulster's largest market. The Hackler from Grouse Hall is an Irish song written in the late 1880s by a local man, Peter Smith, from Stravicnabo, Lavey. It has been sung by Christy Moore, Planxty and Damien Dempsey. In the 1990s a product known as The Hackler, an Irish poitin, was developed by Cooley Distillery. So popular was this song that the promotional literature originally referred incorrectly to a hackler as a maker of Poit√≠n. This error was subsequently corrected.

Unlike remote- controlled robots, Nova 5 uses artificial intelligence to interpret its surroundings, process the information and then navigate independently. It operates via a built-in fuzzy neural network which mimics the function of the human brain‚Äôs neurons. Description The robot is approximately 68 cm wide and 70 cm in length and recognizes objects using on-board sensors, a camera and an advanced edge detection algorithm as well as a normalization algorithm. This mathematical algorithm is part of the on-board training model that detects and stores inputs while studying normal conditions. Operation Utilizing electronic neurons, Nova 5 acquires data using a neural training model, stores the data and then uses the relevant data to make better decisions. This enables the robot to learn over time and use its past experiences for more accurate decisions. Nova 5 acquires input from its environment and reacts to those inputs without human intervention or control. It is used in sniffing and reconnaissance applications, therefore participating in life saving situations. Nova 5 has the ability to detect human emotions using built-in facial recognition. It can also recognize noise and gasses in the surrounding environment such as hydrogen sulfide gas. It can also map an area and generate a 3D map of the area traversed. Nova 5 uses a communication system which operates via a 10 km wireless link and a radio link for enabling human control.

This assists families and acquaintances in re-establishing contact, after they have been separated by the disruption caused by the disaster. Holocaust There are several databases of survivors of the Nazi genocide of Jewish people during World War II. One of these is the Benjamin and Vladka Meed Registry of Holocaust Survivors which is now part of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Red Cross The Red Cross established a register of survivors of the SS Noronic disaster in 1949. Survivors of the Hurricane Katrina disaster also registered with the Red Cross to help notify their friends and family. World Trade Center Following the destruction of the World Trade Center, many telephone lines and transmission facilities were disrupted. Computer programmer and science fiction writer William Shunn was in Queens nearby. At about 11:30 a.m. on September 11, in response to a friend's emailed suggestion that he maintain and circulate a list of acquaintances he had heard from thus far, Shunn posted the names of people he knew were okay on his personal web site and began sending the URL to other friends. Keeping the list up-to-date proved difficult, as more emails flooded in than he could handle. He quickly developed a simple database and form submission system so that visitors to the site could post their own names to the list. This automated system debuted at around 1:00 p.m. that afternoon. Meanwhile, a crew of programmers at the University of California, Berkeley with vastly superior resources were working on a similar concept. Their survivor registry went online at about 3:00 p.m. Eastern time. While Shunn's site foundered and eventually crashed under the heavy load of submissions, the Berkeley site ran on a huge computer cluster, and for the next several days stood out as the most robust and accurate of the many survivor registries that followed. One problem that plagued the survivor registries was that of inaccurate information. So many entries listed actual victims as being okay that Berkeley eventually implemented a system that used cross-checks to gauge the accuracy of the information received. The grassroots generation of survivor registries led many people to wonder why the Federal government did not have such a system already in place. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has since discussed plans for official survivor registries in the future.

The events of the murder and trials resulted in several legal firsts in Canada. Background Tom Collins arrived in Albert County in the fall of 1906. He found room and board with the parish priest of New Ireland, north of present day Fundy National Park. He was there about a week when the priest left on church business. When the priest returned he found the body of his housekeeper Mary Ann McAuley in the woodshed with an axe wound to the back of her head and her throat slit. Tom Collins could not be located in the area but was eventually found north of the community of St. George. He was found with a set of the priest's clothes and a pocket watch belonging to Mary Ann. Tom Collins was taken into custody and questioned later that night. Collins gave his statement of what had happened that day, stating he had had an argument with Mary Ann but denying his guilt in the murder. This statement was not admitted at the first trial due to improper reading of Collins' rights. First trial The Albert County Courthouse was almost new when Collins went on trial there in 1907.The first trial began in January 1907. The prosecutor's case was circumstantial but it received assistance when the judge gave his final instructions to the jury stating in effect that the case was fully proven. The jury took two hours to come back with a verdict of guilty and the judge immediately ordered Collins hanged. The verdict was overturned on the basis of a judicial misdirection, a first in Canadian legal history. Second trial The second trial began on June 25, 1907 with Collins himself taking the stand. The jury deliberated two days but were unable to come to a unanimous verdict, with seven in favour of innocence and five opposed. A hung jury was declared which precipitated a third trial. Third trial The third trial began in the fall of 1907, presided over by the noted Daniel Lionel Hanington. The trial faced immediate trouble selecting the jury. Having had two previous trials and a media circus surrounding the case, it was difficult to find twelve impartial jurors. 120 people were examined, a record at the time, before a suitable jury was selected. Tom Collins was found guilty and sentenced to be hanged. Execution There were several appeals to Ottawa and a last-minute plea to Governor General Earl Grey who, on the advice of the Privy Council, declined commutation. He was hanged by executioner John Radclive at the Albert County Jail on November 15, 1907.

Two years later, FON held a series of conferences about the protection of the Tibetan antelope in conjunction with several international NGOs including World Wide Fund for Nature and International Fund for Animal Welfare. The conferences raised awareness about the plight of the antelope. In October 1998, Liang Congjie submitted an open letter to the British Prime Minister Tony Blair asking the United Kingdom to stop illegal trade on Tibetan antelope fur.

He and guitarist Billy Smiley were the only two original members of the band to stay with White Heart from its conception in 1982 through its disbandment in 1998. Gersmehl played keyboards in the band, as well as occasionally singing lead vocals. He also contributed his songwriting skills, penning 15 of White Heart's 16 No. 1 hits. When the group disbanded in 1998, he began a solo career, releasing his first solo album in 2002. Early life Gersmehl was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana in 1954, and spend his childhood in the area. His first musical memories are classical, at home and at the local Lutheran church. His first instrument was the piano, although he later studied trombone, baritone, flute, and recorder. At the age of 15 he performed his first \\"professional\\" gig at a wedding reception with the New World Quintet. Later, he would play trombone with the O'Jays, the legendary Philadelphia Sound group, as well as with several professional orchestras in Indiana. Gaither Vocal Band While attending Ball State University, Gersmehl began playing horns at the studios of Bill and Gloria Gaither. Other studio musicians suggested that he go on the road with the Gaither Vocal Band, but at first Gersmehl was hesitant. The third time his studio friends insisted, Gersmehl agreed to go on the road. He would play keyboards and horn on tour with the Gaithers for four years. White Heart By 1981, Billy Smiley and Gersmehl, both of whom were playing with the New Gaither Vocal Band at the time, found that they were tired of playing backups for other artists, and felt that they wanted to go out on their own and let the Lord work through them. They decided to start their own contemporary Christian music group singing some of their co-written compositions. Four musicians who were in the Gaither Trio, the Gaither Vocal Band, or both‚ÄîDann and David Huff, Steve Green, and Gary Lunn‚Äîdecided to join the duo in the formation of the band, which was eventually named \\"White Heart\\". Through White Heart's numerous lineup changes, Smiley and Gersmehl, the primary songwriters of the group, stayed on. Gersmehl wrote or co-wrote 15 of the White Heart's 16 No. 1 hits, as well as numerous other Top 10 hits for other artists including Kathy Troccoli, Sandi Patty, and Geoff Moore. The band was nominated for 2 Grammy Awards and 22 Dove Awards; however, they never won either award. In 1998, the group disbanded. Solo career While still with White Heart, Gersmehl was encouraged by others in the music industry to consider a solo career. However, he did not begin a solo career immediately after the disbanding of White Heart. By the early 2000s, Gersmehl was ready to roll again, releasing his first solo album, \\"Awakening\\", in March 2002. Gersmehl continues to tour both in the US and abroad, as well as teaching and encouraging Christians and other musicians. In 2012 Gersmehl started a duo with his wife, Brynn called soulbreather. They now make alt.rock/folk music with a Christian message and travel to churches around the US playing music and occasionally doing soulbreather worship seminars to help worship teams. In 2016, Gersmehl is writing a book about the Soulbreather which he hopes to release in 2017 Family life On an eight-month tour in 1993, White Heart's opening act was Rachel Rachel, CCM's first all-girl rock band. Gersmehl and Rachel Rachel's keyboard player, Brynn Beltran, began a relationship that blossomed into the two falling in love. After the tour, Gersmehl showed up on her doorstep, and proposed.

The game was released in North America and Europe. Gameplay The player's squadron of fighter planes are taking on threats from land and from air in this World War II mission. Players can play as either Nazi Germany, the United States of America, or as Great Britain. This game combines turn-based dogfighting with strategic manoeuvers as the player must position his airplanes to destroy his enemies. Authentic clips from World War II help to improve the realism of this video game. A mostly classical music soundtrack (with some wartime radio music) helps provide ambiance for the aerial settings. This game would eventually have a prequel called Achtung Spitfire! in 1997. Missions range from trying to liberate Nazi-occupied France by air power to attacking the German military power in the heart of Germany itself. The main menu resembles a vintage World War II hangar with difficulty levels ranging from Cadet (allowing new players to dive directly into the game) to Flight Commander (where incidentals like altitude, speed and attitude have to be manually controlled). Creating results that are worse than expected will result in somber music. However, achieving results that are better expected will result in swing music being played. Music played during combat is Ride of the Valkyries by Richard Wagner. Reception Over the Reich was a runner-up for Computer Gaming Worlds 1996 \\"Wargame of the Year\\" award, which ultimately went to Battleground: Shiloh. The editors wrote of Over the Reich, \\"Dogfights are fun, particularly over the Internet, but the real appeal of this game lies in the campaigns, where developing your individual pilots is almost a role-playing game in itself.\\" References * Over the Reich at GameFAQs * Over the Reich at GameSpot * Over the Reich at IGN * Over the Reich at MobyGames Category:1996 video games Category:Avalon Hill video games Category:Mac OS games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Strategy video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:World War II video games Category:Windows games ","title":"Over the Reich"},{"id":"24095307","text":"Astragalin is a chemical compound.

The scutching process separates the impurities from the raw material, such as the seeds from raw cotton or the straw and woody stem from flax fibers.\\"Scutch.\\" The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. Scutching can be done by hand or by a machine known as a scutcher. Hand scutching of flax is done with a wooden scutching knife and a small iron scraper. The end products of scutching flax are the long finer flax fibers called line, short coarser fibers called tow, and waste woody matter called shives. In the early days of the cotton industry the raw material was manually beaten with sticks after being placed on a mesh, a process known as willowing or batting, until the task was mechanised by the development of machines known as willowers. Scutching machines were introduced in the early 19th-century, and processed the raw material into a continuous sheet of cotton wadding known as a lap. Cotton scutching Before cotton is processed, it has to be cleaned of its seeds and other impurities, which, in the early days, was done by spreading the raw cotton on a mesh and beating it with sticks, a process known as willowing or batting. A scutching machine for cotton (known as a scutcher) was invented in 1797, but did not get much attention until it was introduced in the cotton mills of Manchester in 1808 or '09. By 1816, scutchers had been generally adopted. The scutching machine passes the cotton through a pair of rollers, then strikes it with iron or steel bars, called beaters. The rapidly turning beaters strike the cotton hard and knock the seeds out. This process is done over a series of parallel bars, allowing the seeds to fall through. At the same time, air is blown across the bars, which carries the cotton into a cotton chamber. The end result is a continuous sheet of cotton wadding known as a lap, ready for the next stage of the production process, known as carding. Flax scutching Flax scutching machine By hand To scutch flax by hand, the scutching knife is scraped down with a sharp strike against the fibers while they hang vertically. The edge of the knife is scraped along the fibers to pull away pieces of the stalk. This is repeated until all of the stalk has been removed and the flax is smooth and silky. When scutching was done by hand, people could scutch up to of flax in one day, depending on the quality of the flax, as coarser flax, harder flax, and poorly retted flax takes longer to scutch. Retting removes the pectins that bind the fibers to the stalk and each other, so under-retted flax is harder to separate from the stalk, and often gets damaged in the scutching process. Over-retting the flax causes the fibers to deteriorate and break. These broken fibres are called codilla, which can be used along with heckled tow to make yarn. In the scutching process, some of the fiber is also scutched away along with the stalk, a normal part of the process. By machine Scutching is done several ways by machine. Scutching mills started in Ireland, and were commonly used there by 1850, at a time when hand scutching was still common in Continental Europe. Machine scutching, while faster and cheaper, causes more waste than scutching by hand. One method of machine scutching is to crush the stalks between two metal rollers so that parts of the stalk can be separated. A modern scutching machine can process up to of flax every hour, and produces about of flax fibers and of tow (fibre). Older machines create more waste.

By this golden bull, King B√©la IV proclaimed Gradec a royal free city. The document was issued on 16 November 1242 in Virovitica and reaffirmed in 1266. The original is written on a piece of parchment in size, and is kept in strictly controlled conditions in the Croatian State Archives in Zagreb, while a copy is exhibited in the Zagreb City Museum.  Provisions  The Golden Bull declared and proclaimed \\"a free royal city on Gradec, the hill of Zagreb\\". The town was to be presided by a \\"city judge\\" (, ), who was elected yearly by the citizenry and fulfilled the role of the mayor. In addition, eight jurors () and twenty city councillors were elected each year on 3 February, the Feast of St. Blaise. Gradec remained ruled by the iudex until 1850, when Gradec, Kaptol and several other municipalities were formally unified into a new royal city of Zagreb. The edict brought many benefits and freedoms to Gradec's inhabitants. Among others, it stated that the towns were subject directly to the King, not to the nobles whose estate they were situated on. This also brought it outside the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Zagreb, which collected revenue from large land holdings, and was headquartered on the neighbouring hill of Kaptol; during the Middle Ages, conflicts would often break out between the citizens of Gradec and canons of Kaptol, sometimes resulting in civil wars. Citizens also gained freedom of movement, free use of their property, and the freedom to freely draw up their own testament. In addition, they were absolved of paying road and bridge tolls in the Croatian-Hungarian Kingdom. In return for the privileges gained, the citizens were required to erect fortifications around the town at their own expense, which they did in 1266. They were also required to supply the king with \\"12 oxen, 1000 loaves of bread and 4 barrels of wine\\" in case of a royal visit, and ten armed soldiers in case of war. The latter requirement was repealed by the king in 1266. The citizens also had to provide for a visit by the Duke of Slavonia or Ban of Croatia (only one visit for the Ban). The bull also defined the borders of land controlled by Gradec‚Äîthe city was entitled to land south of the ridge of the Medvednica mountain, west of Vrapƒçak stream and north of the Sava River.  Motive  Gradec today The Golden Bull of 1242 was only one in a series of proclamations of royal privileges to towns. In the years preceding the Golden Bull, Mongols had invaded Europe under Batu Khan's command. In early 1241 they reached Hungary, bringing defeat in April that year at the Battle of Mohi on the Saj√≥ River. King B√©la IV and the royal family hid from the Mongols in Zagreb. In the winter of 1241‚Äì42, Mongols crossed the frozen Drava and Danube rivers. The king fled to Dalmatia as Mongols approached the poorly fortified Zagreb, which they levelled and burnt to the ground. The recently consecrated Zagreb Cathedral was razed by the invading army. The Mongol army continued pursuing B√©la until March, when the word of Great Khan √ñgedei's death reached them, and they retreated to Central Asia. Following the cease of hostilities, and in anticipation of a new invasion, B√©la IV issued dozens of privileges encouraging the building of fortified urban settlements, as these turned out to be the only viable holdouts during the war.  Impact  Helped by its location at the intersection of two important trade routes, the new town of Gradec‚Äîprotected by stone walls, unlike its neighbour Kaptol‚Äîreached a population of around 3,000 in the 14th century, which made it a sizable city in then largely rural Central Europe. It was also a financial centre of the Croatian-Hungarian Kingdom, as it held a silver mint, and was the base of the thirtieth tax collection in Slavonia, a major source of employment for the town. In 1267, the citizens of Gradec were absolved of paying the thirtieth. As a royal free city, Gradec was also allowed to hold daily and weekly tax- free fairs, as well as a fortnightly fair around the Feast of St. Mark (held from 17 April to 3 May), which was first held in 1256, on St. Mark's Square. The St. Mark's fair was revived at the turn of the 21st century, and continues in the present day. In 1992, the city of Zagreb celebrated the 750th anniversary of the Golden Bull. An exhibition was held by the Zagreb City Museum and the to commemorate this occasion.

It is set primarily in the Crusader states of Outremer in the twelfth century and features the Battle of Hattin and the Third Crusade. Welch won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject. Plot summary The novel is divided into three parts: the first part leads up to the Battle of Hattin; the second part, set four years later, shows Philip d'Aubigny's escape from captivity at the time of the Third Crusade, and the final part deals with Philip's reclaiming his ancestral lands in the Welsh Marches. At the beginning of the novel, Outremer has been in existence for nearly one hundred years since the capture of Jerusalem in 1099. However, the Emir Saladin is uniting the Islamic forces against the Crusader states. The great military orders of the Knights Templar and Knights Hospitaller are eager for the fray, but others are concerned that there are not enough Christian knights in Outremer to form an effective field army while continuing to garrison the castles that protect the Latin Kingdom. Saladin invades Outremer and besieges Tiberias. Guy of Lusignan, the charming but weak-willed King of Jerusalem, is swayed by poor advice to march the assembled forces of Outremer to the relief of the city across a waterless plain at the height of summer. Debilitated by the desert conditions before the battle even begins, the Christian army suffers a devastating defeat at Hattin. Most of the weakly-held fortresses of Outremer fall to Saladin and Jerusalem is taken by the Muslim armies. These events are shown through the experiences of Philip d'Aubigny. Philip is a young nobleman who was born in Outremer, descendant of a Norman knight who rode with the First Crusade. Philip's father is a Baron of the High Court of Jerusalem and lord of the castle of Blanch Garde. Philip befriends a Turk, Jusuf, whom he rescues from robbers, and later impresses the king by his superior swordsmanship in a duel, gaining his knighthood. Philip overhears much discussion about the complex political and military situation. He suffers on the desert march, sees his father die in battle and is taken prisoner. Philip has a relatively easy captivity in the household of Jusuf's father Usamah in Damascus, but chafes to be free. With Hospitaller help he and his friend Gilbert escape over the walls. They make their way to Krak, the great Hospitaller fortress, after an encounter with the Assassins. Philip commits himself to the service of Richard of England and during the campaigns of the Third Crusade becomes one of the most celebrated knights of Christendom. In the final chapters of the novel, Philip and his company of Crusaders arrive in Britain, where he takes part in a jousting tournament at Cardiff Castle. He learns from his squire's father that his family's castle at Llanstephan has been taken by an ally of Prince John's and leads a raiding party to win it back. A notable aspect of the book is the bringing into contrast of the refinements of the medieval Islamic civilisation, which had been adopted by the Outremer noblemen, with the comparatively stark and crude European living conditions of the time, and the suggestion that the returning Crusaders brought Eastern standards of luxury and culture to the West.

(The Gauntlet, three years earlier, was a timeslip story set partly in the Middle Ages.) It is generally considered the first of his Carey series; although the surname does not appear in this novel, the Careys were Earls of Aubigny. The novel was awarded the Carnegie Medal as the most outstanding children's book of 1954. In The Nesbit Tradition, Marcus Crouch describes Knight Crusader as Welch's finest book: \\"a highly competent piece of writing, the historical detail tightly integrated with the subject matter, the narrative economical and very brisk. The battle scenes are magnificently done\\". However, he criticises its lack of selectivity: \\"Welch was so keen to put all he knew and felt about the Crusades into his book that he dissipated his effects and left a string of loose ends.\\" Marcus Crouch, The Nesbit Tradition: The Children's Novel in England 1945‚Äì1970, Ernest Benn, 1972, pp. 72‚Äì74. In an essay on historical fiction about the Crusades, Robert Irwin discussed Knight Crusader. Irwin stated that \\"Welch's novel is attractively written\\", and notes that \\"it argues the case for coexistence with the enemy.\\" Irwin, Robert, \\"Saladin and the Third Crusade: A Case Study in Historiography and the Historical Novel\\".

Hemming was a regular panel member on the 1970s BBC programme If You Think You've Got Problems. Politics Around 1942‚Äì46 Hemming was involved with Common Wealth, a socialist political party. Later he was active in local Labour Party politics, and was a member of the Green Alliance. Teaching and education He was a governor of St. Georges in the East secondary modern school and Mayfield Girls' Secondary School (now closed). He launched a campaign against the use of the cane, and was an advocate for sex education. He opposed the introduction of Section 28, declaring in 1987 that homosexuality was \\"morally acceptable as a way of life\\". Hemming had a particular interest in moral education, from a humanist perspective, and was active in the work of the Campaign for Moral Education and the Social Morality Council (later The Norham Foundation). He served on the Executive Committee of the Social Morality Council and was on the editorial board of its journal, Journal of Moral Education. He was a member of the Television Research Committee, set up to investigate the impact of mass media on the moral development of young people.

It was the party of former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura (1999‚Äì2003). Originally an affiliate of the Reform Party of the United States of America, the IPM was later affiliated with the Independence Party of America, but is no longer affiliated with any national party, focusing exclusively on Minnesota politics. The party has fielded candidates for most statewide races and was considered a major party by the state from 1994 to 2014. It lost that status when none of its statewide candidates won 5% of the vote in the 2014 gubernatorial election. The party, which was represented in the U.S. Senate by Dean Barkley in 2002‚Äì2003, nominated former U.S. Representative Tim Penny as its candidate in the 2002 gubernatorial election, Peter Hutchinson in 2006 and Tom Horner in 2010. Despite its name, the IPM does not advocate secession from the United States. History The party was formed in 1992 by Minnesota supporters of Ross Perot, and fielded Dean Barkley that year as a candidate for a seat in the US House of Representatives. Other supporters led by Don Dow, State Director, and Victoria Staten, Assistant State Director and Ross Perot's spokesperson on NAFTA, worked as part of United We Stand America, and some eventually found their way to the Independence Party after the elections. Over the following years, the party began to field candidates in other state races. In 1995 the IPMN affiliated with the national Reform Party and renamed itself the Reform Party of Minnesota. The state party carried that name until it disaffiliated from the national party in 2000 due to factional dissent and the increasing influence of Pat Buchanan within the party. The party immediately changed its name back to Independence Party. After his most influential opponents left the party, Buchanan went on to become the Reform Party's candidate for president. Independence Party of Minnesota's 2006 convention at Midway Stadium. On 2004's Super Tuesday, March 2, the party held caucuses around the state along with Minnesota's other three parties. Since the organization had no national party affiliation, it merely ran a straw poll to gauge the opinions of members with regard to the available presidential candidates in the 2004 election. For the poll, the group used instant-runoff voting, a voting method that has been gaining interest in the state. Additionally, the party had several fairly progressive agenda items to vote on. For a bit of levity, there was also a vote on the mascot to use for the party. Three top possibilities were the bison, hawk, and white buffalo. Technology was also involved in the IPMN's caucusing, as it used the Internet to conduct a two-day online \\"virtual caucus\\" for people who were unable to attend the evening of Super Tuesday. On March 5, 2004, the party announced that the presidential winner was John Edwards, who had privately circulated his decision to withdraw shortly before IP members voted. The Super Tuesday ballot was probably the first statewide experiment in instant-runoff voting. The Bison, to be named Indy, won the mascot vote, out-polling the nearest competitors by a 19% margin. In May 2005, Peter Hutchinson, who was Minnesota Finance Commissioner in the Rudy Perpich administration, announced that he was planning to seek the Independence Party's nomination for governor in the 2006 election. Hutchinson finished 3rd of 6 earning 141,735 votes for 6.4% of the total vote. As of 2006, the party has had two members in the Minnesota Senate. Bob Lessard of International Falls, joined the party in 2001 after he was re-elected to the Senate as an independent with 54.3% of the vote. He did not seek re-election in 2002. Also in the 2002 election, Sheila Kiscaden of Rochester was turned down for endorsement for re-election to the Minnesota Senate by the Republican party. She joined the IP and won re-election, giving the Independence Party its first victory in a Minnesota legislative election. She joined the Democratic-Farmer- Labor Party in January 2006. There have been no members of the IPM in the Minnesota House of Representatives. In the 2006 elections IP 5th district congressional candidate Tammy Lee received 51,456 votes for 21.01% of the total vote. Lee's strong showing resulted in part from her unusually strong (for third parties) fundraising, Lee raised $228,938 for her run. In May 2008, a \\"Draft Dean Barkley\\" movement started on the web to encourage the former senator to run again. He accepted, and finished third, winning a significant 15% of all votes cast. His candidacy had a significant impact on a race in which the eventual winner Al Franken and then-incumbent Senator Norm Coleman were separated by only 312 votes. Two other federal candidates, David Dillon in the 3rd congressional district and Bob Anderson in the 6th congressional district, received 10% of the vote in their races. Thus, 2008 is high-water mark for the Minnesota Independence Party in both the number of federal candidates running and the percent of vote received‚Äîboth key measures of the growing base of support. In 2010 gubernatorial candidate Tom Horner, a former public relations executive and chief of staff to U.S. Senator David Durenberger received 12% of the vote, nearly doubling the total of previous IP gubernatorial candidate Peter Hutchinson. Horner polled as high as 18% in the weeks leading up to the election, but was significantly outspent by the GOP and DFL candidates and the third-party expenditure groups supporting their candidacies. Horner did receive endorsement from three of the state's five living ex-governors: Republicans Arne Carlson and Al Quie as well as Ventura. Former U.S. Senate candidate and prominent Minnesota attorney Mike Ciresi also endorsed Horner. Most Minnesota newspapers including the Star Tribune, St. Paul Pioneer Press, St. Cloud Times, Duluth News Tribune, and Rochester Post- Bulletin, as well as North Dakota's Grand Forks Herald endorsed the IP candidate. In 2014, the Independence Party endorsed several candidates for state and national office: Hannah Nicollet for governor, Kevin Terrell for U.S. Senate, attorney Brandan Borgos for Minnesota Attorney General, whistleblower Pat Dean for state auditor, Bob Helland for secretary of state, John Denney for US congress CD-6, Paula Overby for US congress CD-2 and Iraq War veteran Dave Thomas for US congress CD-4. In 2016, the party endorsed Evan McMullin, a former CIA agent and former chief policy director for the House Republican Conference, for President. Platform The Independence Party of Minnesota tends to lean conservative with regards to taxation and other fiscal matters. For example, \\"personal responsibility\\" is a core principle of the party as is a \\"[G]overnment that is fiscally responsible: equitable in its collection of taxes, careful in its spending, and honest in its financial reporting.\\" Many IP candidates have campaigned for tax reform that produces more stable revenues for the state. The IP platform states, \\"We support government budgets that are structurally balanced and avoid shifting of expenses or borrowing to make them appear balanced.\\" In social policy the party tends to take more liberal-libertarian positions on issues such as abortion, gay marriage, and civil rights and liberties. One of its core principles is that \\"All citizens deserve equal rights, protection, and opportunity under the law. In our party and public affairs, we are ever vigilant to promote only those rules and laws which assure equity and freedom for all citizens.\\" Jesse Ventura described the party, as well as his own personal philosophy, as \\"fiscally conservative and socially liberal.\\" At the party's state convention in 2012, delegates passed three new resolutions. One addressed the party's opposition to raiding dedicated state funds to balance general obligations. A second expressed frustration with the overuse of constitutional amendments. A third proposed eliminating legislative pay in the event of a state shutdown like the one that occurred in the summer of 2011. Party delegates also adopted two standing resolutions against both the marriage amendment and the voter ID amendment on the state ballot in November 2012. During the 2013 IP convention the body amended the party platform to support the legalization, taxation and regulation of marijuana. Delegates also lifted the party's prohibition on receiving money from political action committees, citing the need to instead fight for transparency and accountability in Minnesota campaign spending in the aftermath of Citizens United. Partners The Independence Party of Minnesota joined the Minnesotans United for All Families coalition in 2011 after chair Mark Jenkins announced the party's official opposition to the marriage amendment, citing the party's own platform in its opposition. The IP is also a longtime supporter of ranked choice voting (RCV) and FairVote Minnesota, which seeks to expand RCV throughout Minnesota. The party uses RCV to conduct intraparty endorsements including delegates' decision to \\"not endorse\\" for U.S. Senate in 2012. Following the party's official vote to oppose the 2012 voter ID amendment, the campaign seeking to defeat the amendment, \\"Our Vote, Our Future\\", announced former IP gubernatorial candidate Tim Penny as one of its campaign co-chairs. Another former IP gubernatorial candidate, Tom Horner, was named as a member of the group's advisory committee. On May 4th, 2019, the Independence Party of Minnesota merged with Alliance Party, joining other third parties including the Modern Whig Party, the American Party of South Carolina, and the American Moderates.

They departed the club in January 2017.http://nonleague.pitchero.com/news/new- management-set-up-at-aylesbury-47056/ He started his career as a youth player at Marlow, before joining Yeovil Town in 1998. Risbridger then signed for Third Division club Southend United following his former Yeovil manager David Webb, however he only made one appearance and was sent on loan to Conference National club Dover Athletic. He was released from Southend in January 2002, and dropped back into non-League football spending a month at Salisbury City before joining Aylesbury United. In December 2003, he joined former Aylesbury manager, Steve Cordery at Staines Town. After a number of injuries that kept him sidelined for two-and-a-half years, Risbridger joined Bracknell Town on a short loan spell, regaining his fitness. He went on to join Boreham Wood in November 2010. After a period out of the game due to injury, he joined Slough Town in March 2014. Football career Risbridger started his career as a youth player at Marlow, playing the 1997‚Äì98 season in their under-18 team. In summer 1998, he joined Conference National side Yeovil Town, where he made six appearances. He signed for Third Division team Southend United in May 2001, after former Yeovil Town manager David Webb took charge at Southend. Risbridger was the first of three players who Webb signed from his former club, Barrington Belgrave and Ben Smith joined later. Risbridger commented on playing under Webb saying, \\"I worked with him at Yeovil and he gave me my chance there last year. Now I'm looking forward to playing under him again and establishing myself with Southend.\\" During the 2001‚Äì02 season, he made one appearance for Southend. On 11 August, Risbridger made his debut for Southend in their 1‚Äì0 home win over Darlington, replacing Mark Rawle as a substitute in the 89th minute, who had previously replaced Dean Holness. He joined Dover Athletic on loan in October, where he made three appearances in the Conference National. Risbridger was not allowed to play in Dover Athletic's FA Cup fourth qualifying round match against Hereford United, as Southend did not want him to become cup-tied. He was released from Southend in January 2002, by new manager Rob Newman along with Shane Wardley and Ed Chibogu. Following his release from Southend United, Risbridger dropped back into non-League football and signed for Southern Football League Premier Division club, Salisbury City in February. A month later, he joined Aylesbury United, for who he went on to make 44 appearances in all competitions, scoring one goal. In December 2003, Risbridger signed for Isthmian League Division One South side Staines Town, joining former Aylesbury manager Steve Cordery. He made his debut against Horsham in their 0‚Äì0 on 6 December. Between January 2004 and July 2006, Risbridger suffered a series of injuries, that put him out of the game for two-and-a-half years. He had a spell with Bracknell Town on loan in October 2006, to help regain his fitness. At the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season he was awarded the \\"Clubman of the Year\\" award. Risbridger played in Staines 2007‚Äì08 FA Cup first round giant-killing match, when they defeated Stockport County over two legs, eventually winning in a penalty shootout. Staines were defeated in the following round 5‚Äì0 at home to Peterborough United, on 1 December, in which Risbridger played. He went on to join Conference South club Boreham Wood in November 2010. Coaching and refereeing Risbridger holds a UEFA 'B' Pro Licence coaching badge and is also a qualified referee. In December 2014, Risbridger was appointed joint-manager, alongside Danny Gordon, at Burnham as the replacements for Gary Meakin. However the pair departed the club in May 2015 after proving unsuccessful in their bid to prevent Burnham's relegation from the Premier Division. Risbridger returned to football as the assistant manager to Danny Gordon at Aylesbury in May 2016. The pair resigned from their positions in January 2017.http://nonleague.pitchero.com/news/joint-bosses- quit-moles-52371/ Personal life Born in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, Risbridger lives in Marlow.

How to construct random functions * Description: This paper showed that the existence of one way functions leads to computational randomness. IP = PSPACE * Description: IP is a complexity class whose characterization (based on interactive proof systems) is quite different from the usual time/space bounded computational classes. In this paper, Shamir extended the technique of the previous paper by Lund, et al., to show that PSPACE is contained in IP, and hence IP = PSPACE, so that each problem in one complexity class is solvable in the other.

Algorithmic information theory \\"On Tables of Random Numbers\\"  Description: Proposed a computational and combinatorial approach to probability. \\"A formal theory of inductive inference\\" * Ray Solomonoff * Information and Control, vol. 7, pp. 1‚Äì22 and 224‚Äì254, 1964 * Online copy: part I, part II Description: This was the beginning of algorithmic information theory and Kolmogorov complexity. Note that though Kolmogorov complexity is named after Andrey Kolmogorov, he said that the seeds of that idea are due to Ray Solomonoff. Andrey Kolmogorov contributed a lot to this area but in later articles. \\"Algorithmic information theory\\" * Description: An introduction to algorithmic information theory by one of the important people in the area. Information theory \\"A mathematical theory of communication\\" * Description: This paper created the field of information theory. \\"Error detecting and error correcting codes\\" * Description: In this paper, Hamming introduced the idea of error-correcting code.

Elements of Information Theory * Description: A popular introduction to information theory. Formal verification Assigning Meaning to Programs * Description: Robert Floyd's landmark paper Assigning Meanings to Programs introduces the method of inductive assertions and describes how a program annotated with first-order assertions may be shown to satisfy a pre- and post-condition specification ‚Äì the paper also introduces the concepts of loop invariant and verification condition. An Axiomatic Basis for Computer Programming * Description: Tony Hoare's paper An Axiomatic Basis for Computer Programming describes a set of inference (i.e. formal proof) rules for fragments of an Algol-like programming language described in terms of (what are now called) Hoare-triples. Guarded Commands, Nondeterminacy and Formal Derivation of Programs * Description: Edsger Dijkstra's paper Guarded Commands, Nondeterminacy and Formal Derivation of Programs (expanded by his 1976 postgraduate-level textbook A Discipline of Programming) proposes that, instead of formally verifying a program after it has been written (i.e. post facto), programs and their formal proofs should be developed hand-in-hand (using predicate transformers to progressively refine weakest pre-conditions), a method known as program (or formal) refinement (or derivation), or sometimes \\"correctness-by-construction\\". Proving Assertions about Parallel Programs * Edward A. Ashcroft * J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 10(1): 110‚Äì135 (1975) Description: The paper that introduced invariance proofs of concurrent programs. An Axiomatic Proof Technique for Parallel Programs I * Susan S. Owicki, David Gries * Acta Inform. 6: 319‚Äì340 (1976) Description: In this paper, along with the same authors paper \\"Verifying Properties of Parallel Programs: An Axiomatic Approach. Commun. ACM 19(5): 279‚Äì285 (1976)\\", the axiomatic approach to parallel programs verification was presented. A Discipline of Programming * Edsger W. Dijkstra * 1976 Description: Edsger Dijkstra's classic postgraduate-level textbook A Discipline of Programming extends his earlier paper Guarded Commands, Nondeterminacy and Formal Derivation of Programs and firmly establishes the principle of formally deriving programs (and their proofs) from their specification. Denotational Semantics * Joe Stoy * 1977 Description: Joe Stoy's Denotational Semantics is the first (postgraduate level) book-length exposition of the mathematical (or functional) approach to the formal semantics of programming languages (in contrast to the operational and algebraic approaches). The Temporal Logic of Programs * Description: The use of temporal logic was suggested as a method for formal verification. Characterizing correctness properties of parallel programs using fixpoints (1980) * E. Allen Emerson, Edmund M. Clarke * In Proc. 7th International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming, pages 169‚Äì181, 1980 Description: Model checking was introduced as a procedure to check correctness of concurrent programs. Communicating Sequential Processes (1978) * C.A.R. Hoare * 1978 Description: Tony Hoare's (original) communicating sequential processes (CSP) paper introduces the idea of concurrent processes (i.e. programs) that do not share variables but instead cooperate solely by exchanging synchronous messages. A Calculus of Communicating Systems * Robin Milner * 1980 Description: Robin Milner's A Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS) paper describes a process algebra permitting systems of concurrent processes to be reasoned about formally, something which has not been possible for earlier models of concurrency (semaphores, critical sections, original CSP). Software Development: A Rigorous Approach * Cliff Jones * 1980 Description: Cliff Jones' textbook Software Development: A Rigorous Approach is the first full-length exposition of the Vienna Development Method (VDM), which had evolved (principally) at IBM's Vienna research lab over the previous decade and which combines the idea of program refinement as per Dijkstra with that of data refinement (or reification) whereby algebraically-defined abstract data types are formally transformed into progressively more \\"concrete\\" representations. The Science of Programming * David Gries * 1981 Description: David Gries' textbook The Science of Programming describes Dijkstra's weakest precondition method of formal program derivation, except in a very much more accessible manner than Dijkstra's earlier A Discipline of Programming. It shows how to construct programs that work correctly (without bugs, other than from typing errors). It does this by showing how to use precondition and postcondition predicate expressions and program proving techniques to guide the way programs are created. The examples in the book are all small-scale, and clearly academic (as opposed to real-world). They emphasize basic algorithms, such as sorting and merging, and string manipulation. Subroutines (functions) are included, but object-oriented and functional programming environments are not addressed. Communicating Sequential Processes (1985) * C.A.R. Hoare * 1985 Description: Tony Hoare's Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) textbook (currently the third most cited computer science reference of all time) presents an updated CSP model in which cooperating processes do not even have program variables and which, like CCS, permits systems of processes to be reasoned about formally. Linear logic (1987) * Description: Girard's linear logic was a breakthrough in designing typing systems for sequential and concurrent computation, especially for resource conscious typing systems. A Calculus of Mobile Processes (1989) * R. Milner, J. Parrow, D. Walker * 1989 * Online version: Part 1 and Part 2 Description: This paper introduces the Pi-Calculus, a generalisation of CCS which allows process mobility.

One of the first actions as a minister was to establish an obligatory program at every Reichs- Rundfunk-Gesellschaft broadcasting company called the \\"hour of the government\\".

The aforementioned museum and documentation centre are housed in a new purpose- built complex across the public square. History Between July 1942 and September 1944, Kazerne Dossin (Dossin Barracks) was known as SS-Sammellager Mecheln, a Nazi collection and deportation camp. Here, 25,274 Jews and 354 gypsies were rounded up and transported to Auschwitz-Birkenau and other concentration camps in the east. Two-thirds were killed upon arrival. By the time of the liberation and the end of the Holocaust in Belgium, only 1,395 of them had survived. After the war, the former infantry barracks was partially renovated as civil housing; the Flemish Government, Province of Antwerp and the City of Mechelen financing the purchase of the ground floor and the basement of the right wing. In 1995 this building became the site of the Jewish Museum of Deportation and Resistance, later renamed. Museum The new Kazerne Dossin museum and documentation centre building, seen from the former barracks opposite the square, in which historical complex the Holocaust memorial is situated The Museum covered the following aspects of the Final Solution in Belgium and Europe: *The rise of the extreme right in Belgium and abroad in the 1930s, *The antisemitic policies imposed by occupying Germany, *The Jewish resistance and hiding of children, *The deportation of the Belgian Jews in convoys. In 2001, the Flemish Government decided to expand the site by constructing a new museum complex opposite the old barracks. It opened its doors in September 2012 under its present name. Fort Breendonk, a Nazi prison camp near Mechelen, is also open as a museum. Criticism In November 2019, general director Christoph Busch resigned because, in his view, the daily management was focused too much on the Holocaust memorial aspect and not enough on documenting current human rights violations. In March 2020, half of the 18 members of the scientific advisory council resigned after a December 2019 incident where the daily management abruptly cancelled a ceremony where Pax Christi would deliver its peace ambassadorship to Middle East expert . The nine academics said Kazerne Dossin should not be a place to develop the current politics of Israel. Jewish groups had protested the award, claiming Herremans is a pro-Palestinian activist who supports sanctions against Israel and had claimed that pro-Israel activists \\"vastly inflate\\" antisemitism.

On 1 January 2017, the Royal Society for Blind Children (RSBC) and Royal London Society for Blind People (RLSB) joined together to create a charity in England & Wales under the name of the Royal Society for Blind Children.  History  On 12 January 1838, Thomas Lucas established The London Society for Teaching the Blind to Read in the city of London, where he introduced his Lucas Type, an early form of embossed text. Funds for the school were raised largely through the efforts of the Ladies' Committee under the secretaryship of Mrs Lydia Johnson. Her husband, Percival Norton Johnson, founder of what is now Johnson Matthey plc, also took a prominent role in the affairs of the Society for many years. Over the years the school slowly expanded, moving to locations across London, before heading to Aylesbury during World War II and eventually Seal in Kent. A college and nursery were later established to allow RLSB to reach out to more young people. To help vision impaired people gain employment, RLSB also ran a home workers scheme and workshops through the 1900s to allow people to learn a trade and find work. RLSB continued evolved and expanded to meet new needs of vision impaired young people. Supporters and donors have included the Royal family, playwright J. B. Priestley and Charlie Chaplin. On 1 January 2017, the Royal Society for Blind Children (RSBC) and Royal London Society for Blind People (RLSB) joined together to create a charity in England & Wales under the name of the Royal Society for Blind Children. Timeline The original day school opened in Fitzroy Street, London, on 12 January 1839. In 1840, it moved to a larger premises in 6 Gloucester Place, where resident pupils were accepted. In 1842, the organisation moved to larger premises in Bloomsbury; in 1847, a purpose-built school in Swiss Cottage was completed at a cost of ¬£4,500. In 1938, the RLSB's 100th anniversary year, the prefix 'Royal' was added to the Society's title by order of HM King George VI; it became the 'Royal London Society for Teaching the Blind to Read'. At the start of World War II, the children were evacuated from London to a large manor house in Buckinghamshire called 'Dorton House'. In 1954, the Society purchased 'Wildernesse' in Seal and it became the new permanent home of the School. The name 'Dorton House' was transferred to the new property and the school was officially opened in 1956. The RLSB's purpose-built Dorton House School was opened by the Duchess of Gloucester in 1983. Costing ¬£1.75 million to build, it was designed for the education of 140 pupils. In 1989, the Queen opened Dorton's College of Further Education; in 1996, a purpose-built nursery was opened. In 2009, Hollybank Farm was officially opened by the Duchess of Gloucester at Dorton House Campus in Seal. In 2010, Tom Pey joined the RLSB as their Chief Executive Officer.  Dorton College  RLSB conducts an education initiative called Learning and Living with Dorton, which allows young people to continue their education in a semi-independent living environment, accessing a post 16 curriculum in a nearby mainstream college, augmented with specialist support. Students live in one of RLSB's community houses in London and the south-east. RLSB partners with local further education colleges to support students to access a wider range of courses, combined with elements of RLSB's JIGSAW Curriculum (a skills for independent living curriculum) in their community living setting.  RLSB Connections  RLSB runs a network for blind and partially sighted young people called RLSB Connections, through which they can access a range of opportunities. Working across all London Boroughs, RLSB provides support people who are blind or partially sighted find employment. The organisation also works with employed people who have concerns over their deteriorating eyesight, helping them continue to work in an effective manner, as well as identifying employment opportunities for clients and provide training and support services to help employers better meet the needs of their blind and partially sighted employees and customers. RLSB maintains a programme called Sport Without Limits, intended to give visually impaired young people aged 8-25 the chance to experience a range of sporting activities including cricket, football, tennis, goalball, athletics, judo and even rock climbing. The programme features activity days that take place across London, Kent and Sussex.

In developed countries, PVF is a leading cause of death. Worldwide, the annual number of deaths caused by PVF is comparable to the number of deaths caused by road traffic accidents. A substantial portion of these deaths could be avoided by seeking immediate medical attention when symptoms are noticed. Risk factors The risk of PVF during acute myocardial infarction is related to the amount of ST elevation, the presence of hypokalemia, the absence of pre- infarction angina, the size of the infarction, and the presence of a blocked left coronary artery. Other risk factors could include younger age, male gender, and history of sudden cardiac death in first degree relatives. Diagnosis Definition PVF is defined as ventricular fibrillation not preceded by heart failure or shock, in contrast to secondary ventricular fibrillation, which is. Prognosis After return of heart function, there has been a moderately higher risk of death in the hospital when compared to MI patients without PVF. Whether this still holds true with the recent changes in treatment strategies of earlier hospital admission and immediate angioplasty with thrombus removal is unknown. PVF does not affect the long-term prognosis. Survival The survival of PVF largely depends on the promptness of defibrillation. The success rate of prompt defibrillation during monitoring is currently higher than 95%. It is estimated that the success rate decreases by 10% for each additional minute of delay. Incidence Approximately 10% of all myocardial infarctions lead to PVF. The incidence peaks between 20 and 50 minutes after the start of the MI. 2/3 of events occur before medical attendance, and of these medically unattended events, 2/3 occur after more than 30 minutes of warning symptoms.

It was also used by the United States Army Air Force during the World War II North African Campaign. USAAF Ninth Air Force units were assigned to the airfield upon their initial arrival in the area, and once assembled were reassigned to combat airfields in Egypt to fly missions against the Axis forces in Western Egypt and Libya. Known USAAF units which used the airfield were: * 57th Fighter Group, 20 July ‚Äì 15 September 1942, P-40 Warhawk * 64th Fighter Squadron, 19 August ‚Äì 16 September 1942 * 65th Fighter Squadron, 29 July ‚Äì 5 August 1942; 29 August ‚Äì 16 September 1942 After the war, the airfield appears to have been abandoned. Today, the airfield consists of two crumbling concrete runways, one aligned northeast‚Äìsouthwest about 02/20, the other east‚Äìwest 09/27. The east‚Äìwest still remaining full width and length, with a road laid down over the runway. Agricultural fields have been formed from the grassy areas of the airfield but no structures remain of the support base. Small concrete farm roads in the vicinity of the airfield runways are the remainders of taxiways. References * Maurer, Maurer. Air Force Combat Units of World War II.

The royal demesne of France reached its smallest size during his reign, and for this reason he is often seen as emblematic of the weakness of the early Capetians. This is not entirely agreed upon, however, as other historians regard him as a strong but realistic king, who was forced to conduct a policy mindful of the limitations of the French monarchy. Reign A member of the House of Capet, Henry was born in Reims, the son of King Robert II (972‚Äì1031) and Constance of Arles (986‚Äì1034). In the early-Capetian tradition, he was crowned King of France at the Cathedral of Reims on 14 May 1027, while his father still lived. He had little influence and power until he became sole ruler on his father's death. The reign of Henry I, like those of his predecessors, was marked by territorial struggles. Initially, he joined his brother Robert, with the support of their mother, in a revolt against his father (1025). His mother, however, supported Robert as heir to the old king, on whose death Henry was left to deal with his rebel sibling. In 1032, he placated his brother by giving him the duchy of Burgundy which his father had given him in 1016. In an early strategic move, Henry came to the rescue of his very young nephew-in-law, the newly appointed Duke William of Normandy (who would go on to become William the Conqueror), to suppress a revolt by William's vassals. In 1047, Henry secured the dukedom for William in their decisive victory over the vassals at the Battle of Val-√®s-Dunes near Caen; however, Henry would later support the barons against William until the former's death in 1060. In 1034, William married Matilda, the daughter of the count of Flanders, which Henry saw as a threat to his throne. In 1054, and again in August 1057, Henry invaded Normandy, but lost twice at the battles of Mortemer and Varaville. Henry had three meetings with Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor‚Äîall at Ivois. In early 1043, he met him to discuss the marriage of the emperor with Agnes of Poitou, the daughter of Henry's vassal. In October 1048, the two Henries met again and signed a treaty of friendship. The final meeting took place in May 1056 and concerned disputes over Theobald III and County of Blois. The debate over the duchy became so heated that Henry accused the emperor of breach of contract and subsequently left. In 1058, Henry was selling bishoprics and abbacies, ignoring the accusations of simony and tyranny by the Papal legate Cardinal Humbert. In 1060, Henry rebuilt the Saint-Martin-des-Champs Priory outside Paris. Despite the royal acquisition of a part of the County of Sens in 1055, the loss of Burgundy in 1032 meant that Henry I's twenty-nine-year reign saw feudal power in France reach its pinnacle. King Henry I died on 4 August 1060 in Vitry-en-Brie, France, and was interred in Basilica of St Denis. He was succeeded by his son, Philip I of France, and Henry's queen Anne of Kiev ruled as regent. At the time of his death, he was besieging Thimert, which had been occupied by the Normans since 1058. Marriages Henry I was betrothed to Matilda, the daughter of Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor, but she died prematurely in 1034. Henry then married Matilda of Frisia, but she died in 1044, following a Caesarean section. Casting further afield in search of a third wife, Henry married Anne of Kiev on 19 May 1051. They had: # Philip I (c. 1052 ‚Äì 30 July 1108). # Emma (1054 ‚Äì 1109?). # Robert (d. 1060). # Hugh \\"the Great\\" of Vermandois (1057‚Äì1102).

It is written in Scottish dialect and the beaver refers to a gentleman's hat in an era when all high quality men's hats were made of felted beaver fur. It was based on an older song, published as \\"Johnny, cock up thy Beaver\\". It is widely claimed that this is found in The Dancing Master, a collection of folk tunes published by John Playford of London in 1657. However, this is disputed by Scottish music scholar John Glen who states it first appears in the 1686 edition of \\"The Dancing Master\\". It was originally published in 1792 in volume 4 of the Scots Musical Museum and again in 1821 in a compilation by James Hogg, with four verses and musical notation of a tune. The original version was English, and ridiculed Scotsmen who settled in London after the accession of James VI to the throne of England, possibly satirizing the costumes of highland chiefs entering the lowlands. The song, hand-written by Burns, is in the Scots Musical Museum.

Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, the Alte Pinakothek in Munich and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, among others. Career Engebrechtsz. was the first painter in Leiden to whom work can be attributed with certainty.Rijksmuseum Amsterdam (archived) The first mention of Engebrechtsz. in the archives was in 1482, when he sold some work to the Hieronymusdal priory (also known as Lopsen) in Oegstgeest, near Leiden. He may have been trained as a painter in this monastery as well, although it is also quite possible that he received training in Brussels and Antwerp. He painted primarily Biblical themes, like a triptych of the Lamentation of Christ and a triptych of the Crucifixion. Both were made for the Mari√´npoel convent in Leiden and are now in Leiden's city museum, Stedelijk Museum De Lakenhal. He also received commissions from the Leiden city government. Engebrechtsz. had a large, prolific workshop where he produced devotional art, together with his sons and other pupils. Through his sons, his later work became more and more influenced by Mannerism, a popular style of painting in Antwerp at that time (see Antwerp Mannerism). This Mannerist influence is clearly visible in the two triptychs. Life Engebrechtsz. was born sometime between 1460 and 1465. He probably lived in Leiden uninterrupted from about 1497 until his death. Engebrechtsz. was a member of the local archer schutterij (militia) from 1499 tot 1506 and the crossbow militia from 1515 to 1522. Around 1520 he served as captain of the crossbow militia. Engebrechtsz. married Elysbeth Pietersdr. in of around 1487. They had six children, including three sons, all of whom followed in their father's footsteps and became painters. Engebrechtsz. died somewhere between 11 February and 26 August 1527. There was some quarreling over his inheritance after his death, indicating that he has amassed a considerable estate.\\"Cornelis Engebrechtsz.\\", Grove Dictionary of Art (archived) See also * Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting References Further reading * Jeremy Dupertuis Bangs, Cornelis Engebrechtsz., a documentary study of the man and his artistic environment, Gemeentelijke Archiefdienst (Leiden), 1975 * Jeremy Dupertuis Bangs, Cornelis Engebrechtsz's Leiden: Studies in Cultural History, Van Gorcum, Assen, 1979 * Franz D√ºlberg, Die Leydener Malerschule, G.

A further general election was held in December of the same year, and Newman held the seat with a reduced majority of 936 votes. During the First World War Newman served with the Middlesex Regiment on the Western Front, reaching the rank of major. Member of parliament for Finchley Due to the First World War no further election was held until 1918. The Representation of the People Act 1918 redrew constituencies throughout Great Britain, and Newman was elected as first member of parliament for the new Finchley constituency, which included part of the existing Enfield seat. He held the seat at the 1922 election, but was defeated by his Liberal opponent, T A Robertson, when a further election was called in 1923. He was knighted in February 1924 as part of the resignation hours of Stanley Baldwin. Middle Class Union Newman was on the right wing of Conservative politics. He expressed admiration for fascism in his role as vice-president of the Middle Class Union formed in 1919 as an Anti-Socialist group to maintain public services in the event of strike action. Later life Newman was the director of a number of companies including Allied Cement and Stream-Line Filters. In 1928, while chairman of Perfecta Meters Limited, he wrote a letter to a shareholder of the company making allegations against the managing director of the company. Newman was found guilty of libel, and damages of 1,500 pounds were awarded against him. Newman died on 12 March 1947 in Farnham, Surrey, and was cremated in Woking two days later.

They met in 1995 in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. Since then they have created a multitude of sound works from atonal orchestral pieces to electropunk / baile funk / miami bass- driven tunes. They have also made a series of ritualistic performances and have extensively exhibited art films and video throughout Europe and South America. Tetine has a few albums released on different record labels (Slum Dunk Music/Bizarre Music/Soul Jazz Records/Sulphur Records/Mr Bongo). Biography Formed in 1995 in S√£o Paulo, Brazil by artists Eliete Mejorado and Bruno Verner and infused with a contemporary Brazilian radicalism that pushes the boundaries of a hybrid vocabulary, Tetine have created a multitude of music and performance works from the spoken word to electronica, including ritualistic performances, films and video. Their debut album Alexander's Grave was released in 1996 on their own label High School Records, leading to the birth of a homonymous performance integrating atonal electronic music and Super 8 films over spoken and sung narratives. In 1998 Tetine released their second album Creme - a soundtrack for the dance group UR=HOR led by Brazilian performance artist Adriana Banana. In 1999 their third album M√∫sica de Amor (Love Songs) is released on High School Records.

It was first published in 2008 in the anthology Eclipse 2: New Science Fiction and Fantasy, edited by Jonathan Strahan. In 2019, the story was included in the collection of short stories Exhalation: Stories. Plot The story is epistolary in nature, taking the form of a scientist's journal entry. The scientist is a member of a race of air-driven mechanical beings. The race obtains air from swappable lungs filled with pressurized air (argon) from underground. When it is realized that a number of clocks simultaneously appear to be running fast but they do not appear to be malfunctioning, the narrator decides to explore the explanation that people's brains are computing slower. The scientist dissects his own brain and discovers that it operates based on the movement of air through tubes with small flaps of gold leaf acting as switches. The scientist hypothesizes that others' brains are computing slower because rising atmospheric pressure causes air to move the gold leaf at a slower rate, and that the subterranean supply of argon will eventually be depleted, equalizing the pressure between the two atmospheres.

It was nominated for the 2009 Hugo Award for Best Short Story.The LOCUS Index to SF Awards Plot summary The story is about a human and a millipede-like alien who flee the destruction of a magnificent alien city. \\"Imagine a cross between Byzantium and a termite mound. Imagine a jeweled mountain, slender as an icicle, rising out of the steam jungles and disappearing into the dazzling pearl-grey skies of Gehenna.

Regarding this story, he wrote: \\"FBF'nGWF... is all that remains of what was originally going to be a novel. I put a lot of ideation into making notes, creating a stellar system, a way of moving humans into it, a version of information economics that went way beyond the predatory, an alien society, a human society... and then one day realized that it had been two years and I still didn't have any characters or a plot. So I got to work on a different novel. A working writer abhors waste, however, so I took as many of my ideas as I could and put them into this story. Someday, I may write another story showing how the humans got to Gehenna in the first place.\\" \\"From Babel's Fall'n Glory We Fled...\\" , Friday, May 3, 2013 Swanwick devised a novel language for the aliens, based on Asian (Chinese?) languages: \\"...take a look at the cluster of alien ‚Äúspeech‚Äù above [at cite].

He became one the favourite pupils of the Master of the college, Benjamin Jowett, and was later a close and lifelong friend. He won several prestigious prizes and graduated with first class honours in 1860. He was elected as a fellow of Oriel College, Oxford, and for the next few years divided his time between academic work and studying for the legal profession. He was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in June 1865.\\"Wright, Sir Robert Samuel\\", Who Was Who, Oxford University Press, 2014 retrieved 21 June 2015 As a young lawyer, Wright made a mark with well-received publications on legal topics including the laws of conspiracy, possession, local government and taxation. His practice as a barrister flourished, and in 1883 he was appointed Junior Counsel to the Treasury.in succession to A. L. Smith. Wright prosecuted in that year's Fenian dynamite trials. He also appeared for the petitioner in the Dilke divorce case of 1886. The Junior Counsel to the Treasury was often described as \\"the Attorney General's devil\\", and one of the Attorneys General whom he served commented, \\"Wright has the whole law of England at his fingers' ends\\". In this, Wright was at first assisted by his own junior, H. H. Asquith, whose legal and political career took off with his appointment by Wright. In 1870, Wright was asked by the Colonial Office to draft a criminal code for Jamaica which could be used as a model criminal code for other colonies. Although ultimately not adopted in Jamaica, it was adopted in several other British colonies, and came to be highly regarded. Holding strong Liberal views, Wright stood unsuccessfully for Parliament in 1884 and 1886. His liberal views may have been an impedance to his later judicial career. Holders of the post of Junior Counsel to the Treasury were traditionally elevated from the post straight to the judicial bench, without becoming a Queen's Counsel. In 1890, on the death of Baron Huddleston Wright was appointed as a judge of the Queen's Bench. He initially declined the knighthood that customarily went with the appointment, but later accepted it. Among Wright's important judgments was that in the case of Wilkinson v. Downton (1897), and his views played an important part in Allen v Flood [1898]. Despite his legal talents he was not appointed to the Court of Appeal; the obituarist in The Times speculated that this may have been due to his politics at a time when a Conservative Lord Chancellor controlled judicial appointments. Wright married in 1891. His wife Mabel Emily, n√©e Chermside, was the daughter of a clergyman. There were two sons of the marriage; one died in infancy and the other became a senior diplomat. Wright died at his country house, Headley Park, Hampshire at the age of 65.

It was nominated for the 2009 Nebula Award for Best Novelette and the 2009 Hugo Award for Best Novelette.The LOCUS Index to SF Awards Plot summary ‚ÄúThe Gambler,‚Äù written by Paolo Bacigalupi, is a science fiction novelette focusing on a young news reporter that is struggling to adapt to the fast paced American culture. After the pretender monarch Khamsing completely burglarized the entire country of Laos, forming the New Lao Kingdom, Laos, otherwise referred to throughout the story as ‚Äúthe black hole,‚Äù went into shambles. Concluding that their son should not be in such a chaotic and violent monarchy, his parents shipped him over to Los Angeles, where he became a news reporter at Milestone Media. The company‚Äôs maelstrom, called LiveTrack IV, is supposed to be tremendously significant to the world of media. Livetrack IV tracks media user data such as Web site, feed, VOD, audio stream, and TV broadcast. Unfortunately for Ong, Milestone Media primarily infatuates itself with the popularity of their company. The number of click-throughs, page views, social-pokes, and ad revenue a story accumulates are precisely what Janice Mbutu, Milestone‚Äôs managing director, is looking for. She emphasizes the significance of happy, fun, and pleasant reports from her staff. This inaugurates a crucial dilemma for Ong, who enjoys more serious and idealistic topics to write about, involving areas pertaining to politics, government, and environment. When Janice sees that Ong is amassing less than a thousand pings on his byline feed on average, she threatens to terminate him if he does not start accumulating at least fifty thousand pings daily. Marty, a top notch worker who generates an incredible number of readers, clicks and amount of ad dollars by formulating the story about a Russian cowboy rapper who is accused of impregnating a fourteen-year-old, speculates that Ong is on the verge of termination, and makes him a proposition. Marty offers him to interview Kulaap, an Asian pop sensation residing from Laos, whom Omg admire. Obviously, Ong agrees to take the job. When Ong is introduced to her, she is not what he expected. She seems almost entirely Americanized. He becomes even more astonished when she bluntly criticizes the questions Ong asks her during the interview. Kulaap then proceeds to put on a show for the paparazzi by taking him out on a date to a Laotian restaurant, initially for the mere fact that she wanted to help him boost his numbers. As the date progresses however, the chemistry between them amplifies. They proceed to discuss their similar experiences and adventures in Viantiane as well as other parts of Laos. The date goes amiss when the topic of Ong‚Äôs stories commences. Kulaap openly blurts out disparaging remarks regarding his writings. Ong takes some offense to this and becomes uncontrollably irritated. He compares the workers in his field to a smart monkey, asserting that they will talk about whatever they think you want to hear, completely dismissing anything else that might be depressing or negative, even if it‚Äôs a pivotal and consequential subject. Ong then demands for the limo driver to stop the car so he can leave. After returning to work, Janice immediately insists that Ong publish his interview/date with Kulaap. Ong boldly denies her request which only infuriates Janice. Ong tells her the next story he wants to publish is on his idea on bluets, a flower that is close to extinction because of global warming. Janice opposes the idea, postulating that nobody will read it. Infuriated, Janice bluntly threatens that Ong have fifty thousand readers daily or else she will terminate him, which will lead to his deportation back to the chaotic Laos. Gambling nearly his entire life on this decision, he boldly clicks the button to have his article published.

Bardini's connections with Bernard Berenson resulted in several of Bardini's purchases finding their way to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston, where Berenson was the guiding light; among them are two North Italian Romanesque stylobate, column-supporting lions and a basin, purchased from Bardini in 1897.Walter Cahn, \\"Romanesque Sculpture in American Collections.

Madonna with Angels, glazed terracotta, by Andrea Della Robbia In the decades after 1860 he was also responsible for the transformation of many painted cassone panels that had been previously removed from the furniture, which was considered valueless, by creating new carved and part gilded walnut cassoni in the pristine condition that was required of furniture for grand houses.Callmann 1999:341f. Of such cassoni, the quantity that came onto the market were astonishing: the German art historian Paul Schubring was shown an outbuilding, probably at Bardini's Torre del Gallo, that consisted of a single room in which he counted some 200 cassoni.Schubring, Cassoni, Truhen und Truhenbilder der italienischer Fr√ºherenaissance (Leipzig, 1923 supplement), noted in Callmann 1999:342.

Not all Bardini's cassoni were heavily restored: the famous cassone painted with The Conquest of Trebizond from Palazzo Strozzi, with Strozzi armorial bearings, one of the minority of cassone panels remaining integral to its cassone, is conserved at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.Helmut Nickel, \\"Two Falcon Devices of the Strozzi: An Attempt at Interpretation\\", Metropolitan Museum Journal 9 (1974:229‚Äì232).

In 1881 Bardini acquired the deconsecrated church and convent of San Gregorio facing piazza dei Mozzi in the Oltrarno and set about transforming it into his opulent residence and restoration studio, Palazzo Bardini, now housing the Museo Bardini, with his collections of paintings, sculpture, most notably a marble Charity by Tino da Camaino, 15th- and 16th- century Italian furniture, ceramics, tapestry, arms; stringed and keyboard musical instruments, including one of only two surviving oval spinets by Bartolomeo Cristofori; Roman and Etruscan antiquities and 15th- and 16th- century architectural fittings, including paneled and painted ceilings, chimneypieces and door surrounds.Touring Club Italiano, Firenze e dintorni (Milan, 1964:376-79). His example inspired his most successful prot√©g√©, Elia Volpi, to purchase and freely restore Palazzo Davanzati in the heart of Florence, and fill it with a similar range of art. Florentine cassone with gilded pastiglia panel, 15th century Bardini's extensive connections among impecunious patricians and with dealers and restorers opened many avenues for acquiring works of art. Works of art from the Giampietro Campana collection, dispersed in 1858, later passed, probably indirectly, through Bardini's hands.W.L. Hildburgh, \\"A marble relief attributable to Donatello and some associable stuccos\\", The Art Bulletin, 30.1 (March 1948:11‚Äì19). In 1892 Bardini was commissioned to oversee the dispersal of a major part of the Borghese Collection in Rome. In the spring of 1892 Bardini prepared a lavish catalogue for an auction sale of pieces from his own collection, held at Christie's.Catalogue des objets d'art, antiques, du Moyen Age et de la Renaissance, provenant de la collection de Stefano Bardini, Florence Christie's, London, 26‚Äì30 May 1902 In 1902 he purchased the Torre del Gallo at Pian de' Giullari, in the hills of Arcetri, on top of a ridge with a panoramic view over the city. There he undertook neo-medieval restorations that were carried out between 1904 and 1906. In winding down his activities, Bardini organized a sale in New York in 1918 that dispersed his sculpture and furniture into American private collections, and which eventually came to American museums.Catalogue of the Beautiful Treasures and Antiquities illustrating the Golden Age of Italian Art belonging to the famous expert and antiquarian Stefano Bardini of Florence, Italy, American Art Association, New York, 23‚Äì28 April 1918. Among the works was a polychromed terracotta of the Virgin and Child that remains firmly attributed to Donatello, \\"in the small class of autograph Donatello reliefs\\", as John Pope-Hennessy observed.John Pope-Hennessy, \\"A terracotta 'Madonna' by Donatello\\", The Burlington Magazine 125 No. 959 (February 1983: 83‚Äì66).

His bequest to the city of Florence resulted in the opening of the Museo Bardini in 1923; the Giardino Bardini across from it is also his legacy.

Introduced as the Blue Bird Transit Home in 1963, the Wanderlodge was a derivative of the Blue Bird All American school bus for over year; two further generations were produced, adapting motorcoach body and chassis design. Assembled by Blue Bird in Fort Valley, Georgia, each example of the Wanderlodge was built to customer specification. In complete contrast to Blue Bird school buses, no two Wanderlodges were alike; each example was assembled with a hand-crafted interior, with over 200 available options (with some examples adding additional customization). Through much of its first generation, the Wanderlodge was priced in comparison to a medium-sized American home (dependent on customization); latter examples would rise significantly in price, competing against coaches from Newell and Prevost. Highly prized by their owners, many examples were sold to middle/upper-class families, with some examples sold to celebrities and heads of state around the world. As part of a reorganization of Blue Bird Corporation, the rights to the Wanderlodge model line were sold in 2007, with the model line ending production in 2009, after 44 years of continuous production.  Background  By the early 1960s, Blue Bird Body Company had expanded from its beginnings in rural Georgia to become the fourth-largest manufacturer of school buses in the United States. While leading the segment, in looking towards the future, Blue Bird company management sought to diversify product offerings beyond school buses. As motorhomes began to evolve from travel trailers in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the company saw an opportunity to design its own vehicle. In 1963, Blue Bird designed the Blue Bird Transit Home prototype, derived from the Blue Bird All American. Assembled by newly-created subsidiary Cardinal Manufacturing in Fort Valley, Georgia, the 1963 Transit Home was a promotional vehicle, driven throughout the United States by company employees for two years to campgrounds and RV parks. The tour received little attention, with Blue Bird nearly deciding to shelve the concept of producing a motorhome altogether. In 1965, House Beautiful magazine published an article about the Transit Home; soon after, the company secured five orders for the $12,000 vehicle (approximately $96,760 in 2018 dollars). A central feature of the design of the vehicle was its body commonality with the Blue Bird All American school bus. In contrast to a motorhome, the All American subjected its heavy-duty frame to stop-and-go driving on a daily basis (Blue Bird had built school buses with all-steel bodies since 1937). The prototype also offered several features unseen before in a motorhome, including a built-in safe, redundant heating and hot water systems that used electricity, engine heat or diesel, and fuel tanks offering a driving range in excess of . First generation (1963‚Äì1990) \\"Way To Go\\", a 1979 Blue Bird Wanderlodge set up for camping. After the first five orders for the Transit Home were completed in 1965, Blue Bird began full-scale production of the vehicle in 1966. Derived from the All American Forward Engine, the Transit Home was produced in a 31-foot body length, powered by a Ford Super Duty V8. Along with the availability of customer-specified paint color (as school bus yellow was illegal on recreational vehicles), the Transit Home differed from the All American in its use of a center-mounted entry door. For 1968, several changes were made, as Blue Bird changed the name of its motorhome from Transit Home to Wanderlodge (a slight portmanteau of wanderlust and lodge). The roofline of the bus saw a revision, adapting a flat front panel above the windshield; vertically-stacked headlights were added to the front fascia. For 1969, nine 35-foot long rear-engine Wanderlodges were produced with the Super Duty V8 (among the rarest Wanderlodges ever built). In the 1970s, while the Wanderlodge remained a front-engine vehicle, 33-foot and 35-foot body lengths were introduced (in 1974 and 1975, respectively). For 1977, to improve the fuel economy and performance of the vehicle, Blue Bird introduced the Caterpillar 3208 diesel V8 as an option, with the 3208 replacing the Ford gasoline V8s entirely after 1978. For 1979, to mark the fifteenth anniversary of the Wanderlodge, the 1979-only XV model was introduced. Based on the 35-foot forward-engine configuration, the XV differed in its use of double frame rails. In 1982, Blue Bird introduced a production rear-engine Wanderlodge, produced in 35 and 40-foot lengths. Powered by a Detroit Diesel 6V92 engine, the rear-engine Wanderlodge was fitted with a rear tag axle. Along with the use of a tag axle and a rear engine configuration, the rear-engine Wanderlodge was externally distinguished by horizontally- mounted headlights and a taller body height, as it used a double-rail frame (introduced by the 1979 Wanderlodge XV). As part of the introduction, Blue Bird redesignated the Wanderlodge model line, with Wanderlodge FCxx denoting the forward-engine model and its body-length and PTxx denoting the rear-engine model and its body length. For 1983, Wanderlodge FC models added a second standard floor plan, adding a rear-mounted bathroom (RB) in place of the mid- ship configuration (SB) which was standard since its introduction (note that some earlier models from approximately 1978-1983 had optional rear bath units); the configuration was offered on 33 and 35-foot lengths. To further improve the performance of the FC, the naturally-aspirated Cat 3208 was replaced by a turbocharged version, increasing output to 225 hp (250 hp before the closure of the model year). A third version of the PT was introduced, adding a 38-foot length alongside the 35 and 40-foot versions. Through the 1980s, the Blue Bird Wanderlodge underwent a series of gradual updates. In 1986, the PT line was revised, with the addition of a 8V92 Detroit Diesel as an option; the PT35 was extended in length, becoming the PT36. 1987 marked a transitional year for the Wanderlodge exterior design. While the lower front fascia was redesigned, marking the introduction of rectangular headlamps and a redesigned grille (covering nearly the entire front fascia on the FC), the roof caps were shared with the All American for the last time. In an effort to de-emphasize the school bus origins of the Wanderlodge, for 1988, on rear- engine models, the metal roof caps were replaced with fiberglass versions (allowing for a more rounded appearance). During the 1980s, federal law restricted school buses to maximum width of , while motorcoaches were allowed their present-day width of . To better compete against more recently- introduced designs, for 1988, Blue Bird introduced a 102-inch \\"Wide Body Pusher\\". While based on the standard 96\\" Wanderlodge PT, the Wanderlodge Wide Body Pusher shared virtually no resemblance to the All American or TC/2000, with aerodynamic roof caps and redesigned bumpers (specific to the Wanderlodge). While the use of a school bus body for the Wanderlodge provided for fairly conservative exterior design (depending on owner configuration), Blue Bird marketed the vehicle based on its high specifications and high degree of customization, built entirely to order. By the end of the 1980s, a Wanderlodge was available with nearly 200 standard options. Along with the common bedroom and bathroom (fitted with a bathtub), the Wanderlodge could be fitted with full kitchen, a gas grill, a doorbell, and a central vacuum system; a popular option among owners was a programmable horn with 60 different sounds. From the initial $12,000 at its introduction, depending on version, the base price had risen to $199,000-$350,000 (approximately $441,110-775,822 in 2018); the custom-built nature of the Wanderlodge could allow owners to nearly double the purchase price in options and custom specifications. While also purchased by celebrity owners and heads of state, Blue Bird found that the name of the vehicle was chosen well; many Wanderlodge purchasers were couples with the funds to afford the purchase and a high desire to travel the country by road. For 1989, Blue Bird revised its rear- engine lineup, with the introduction of a 36-foot long single-axle pusher (Wanderlodge SP), and only the Wide Body Pusher versions of the Wanderlodge PT remained in production. After 23 years in production, 1989 marked the final year of the forward-control Wanderlodge (alongside the generation of the Blue Bird All American it was derived from, introduced in 1957). In terms of size, the FC was replaced by the SP, which continued the use of the Caterpillar 3208 diesel.  Model designations  * Blue Bird Transit Home (1963, 1965-1967) * Blue Bird Wanderlodge/Wanderlodge FC (1968-1989) * Blue Bird Wanderlodge XV (1979) * Blue Bird Wanderlodge PT (1982-1992) * Blue Bird Wanderlodge SP (1989-1992) * Blue Bird Wanderlodge Wide Body Pusher (1988-1990) Second generation (1991‚Äì1997) By the end of the 1980s, the design of the Blue Bird Wanderlodge had entered a period of struggle. While its chassis derived from the Blue Bird All American and all-steel body allowed for a high degree of durability and a reputation of quality, along with its 96\\" inch width, elements of its design had begun to fall behind designs introduced in the 1980s, including luxury motorhomes based on intercity motorcoaches. While the reputation of the Wanderlodge for hand-built quality and customization remained marketable, Blue Bird sought to shift the design away from that of the All American and TC/2000. For 1991, both the SP and Wide Body Pusher underwent an extensive redesign; with the exception of Blue Bird badging, virtually all visual ties to the All American were removed from the design. Along with redesigned body caps, the front and rear bumpers were updated with the introduction of body-color bumper covers. 1992 marked the final year of the Wanderlodge SP, as Wanderlodge production shifted to 102\\" wide vehicles. In 1994, to enter the single-axle rear-engine Class A motorhome segment, Blue Bird introduced the BMC (Blue Bird Motor Coach). While not marketed under the Wanderlodge name, the 37-foot BMC was built in the same factory as the Wanderlodge. In line with the wide-body Wanderlodge, the BMC was produced with a 102\\" wide body; unlike all previous Blue Bird motorhomes, BMCs had a chassis produced by custom chassis manufacturer Spartan Motors of Michigan (a company which also had school bus chassis manufacturing). In the mid-1990s, the Wanderlodge model line underwent a slight revision. For 1995, a 42-foot Wanderlodge was introduced (the longest ever), with a 40-foot tag-axle version of the BMC introduced in 1996; in 1997, both versions of the Wanderlodge were extended a foot in length (to 41 and 43 feet, respectively).  Model designations  * Blue Bird Wanderlodge SP (1991-1992) * Blue Bird Wanderlodge Wide Body Pusher (1991-1997) * Blue Bird/Spartan Motors BMC (1994-1997) Third generation (1998‚Äì2009) For the end of the 1990s, Blue Bird introduced a third generation of the Wanderlodge. Coinciding with the withdrawal of the Spartan-chassis BMC, the 1991-generation Wanderlodge was completely redesigned from the ground up. In 1997, Blue Bird introduced its first intercity motorcoach, the LTC-40, forming the basis of the third- generation Wanderlodge. Two versions were produced: the 40-foot long LX and the LXi (offered in 41 and 43-foot lengths); the LX was powered by a Cummins M11 diesel, while the LXi was produced with a Detroit Diesel Series 60 engine. Parked next to a 1997 Wanderlodge, the LX and LXi were visually distinguished by a much larger windshield; the LX was fitted with the four halogen headlamps of the LTC-40 while the LXi used a system of projector-beam headlamps. As an industry first, the 1998 Blue Bird Wanderlodge LXi was among the first motorcoaches fitted with slide-out expansions. For 2001, the exterior of the Wanderlodge underwent an update for the last time. Along with a shared headlight design for the LX and LXi, the design better integrated the front bumper into the body. For 2002, slide-outs were standardized across the model range, with one or two offered for the body. For 2003, to return to the single-axle segment, Blue Bird introduced the Wanderlodge M380, effectively replacing the Blue Bird BMC. Produced entirely by Blue Bird Wanderlodge, the M380 was a 38-foot single-axle pusher motorcoach with a Cummins ISL diesel engine; in line with the LX and LXi, the M380 also was produced with slide- outs. In 2004, the model nomenclature of the Blue Bird Wanderlodge was revised. In line with the M380, the LXi was renamed the M450 LXi, with a 45-foot length becoming the sole configuration of the LXi.  Model designations  * Blue Bird Wanderlodge LX (1998-2003) * Blue Bird Wanderlodge LXi/M450LXi (1998-2009) * Blue Bird Wanderlodge M380 (2003-2009)  End of production  From the 1990s to the 2000s, the ownership of Blue Bird underwent a significant transition, changing from family-based ownership to ownership by capital management firms to transportation conglomerates, changing hands twice by 2006. While the company itself was under sound financial footing, financial issues of its various parent companies placed Blue Bird under an uncertain future during the early 2000s. In an effort to remain competitive, Blue Bird concentrated all production on its school bus product lines, withdrawing from motorcoach production and ending production of its transit buses. Forming the basis of the Blue Bird Wanderlodge LX and LXi, the Blue Bird LTC-40 motorcoach was withdrawn in 2003. To further concentrate its resources on school bus production, in 2007, Blue Bird put its Wanderlodge motorcoach division for sale. The division, production facility, and the rights to the Wanderlodge name were sold to Complete Coach Works, a California-based company that specialized in bus refurbishing and manufacturing. The Wanderlodge M380 and M450LXi continued production, with the removal of the Blue Bird company name. In April 2009, Complete Coach Works ended production of the Wanderlodge model line, closing down the assembly facility in Fort Valley, Georgia. {class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"margin:auto;\\" colspan=\\"84\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" |Blue Bird Wanderlodge Timeline, 1963‚Äì2009 |- style=\\"text-align:center; background:##f0f0f0; background:#f0f0f0;\\" ! colspan=\\"2\\"  |Production colspan=\\"7\\" |1960s colspan=\\"10\\" style=\\"width:10%; \\" |1970s colspan=\\"10\\" style=\\"width:25%; \\" |1980s colspan=\\"10\\" style=\\"width:25%; \\" |1990s colspan=\\"10\\" style=\\"width:20%; \\" |2000s |- style=\\"background:#f0f0f0; text- align:center;\\" |'63 |'64 |'65 |'66 |'67 |'68 |'69 |'70 |'71 |'72 |'73 |'74 |'75 |'76 |'77 |'78 |'79 |'80 |'81 |'82 |'83 |'84 |'85 |'86 |'87 |'88 |'89 |'90 |'91 |'92 |'93 |'94 |'95 |'96 |'97 |'98 |'99 |'00 |'01 |'02 |'03 |'04 |'05 |'06 |'07 |'08 |'09 |- ! colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background:#f0f0f0;\\" |Manufacturer colspan=\\"44\\" style=\\"background:#f0f0f0;\\" align=\\"center\\" |Blue Bird Body Company/Blue Bird Corporation colspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"background:#f0f0f0;\\" align=\\"center\\" |Complete Coach Works |- align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background:#f0f0f0;\\" |Conventional colspan=\\"5\\" style=\\"background:#63A4C7\\" |Blue Bird Inn colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background:#d0d0d0;\\"  colspan=\\"10\\" style=\\"background:#d0d0d0;\\"  colspan=\\"10\\" style=\\"background:#d0d0d0;\\"  colspan=\\"10\\" style=\\"background:#d0d0d0;\\"  colspan=\\"10\\" style=\\"background:#d0d0d0;\\" - align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background:#f0f0f0;\\" |Front engine colspan=\\"5\\" style=\\"background:#63A4C7\\" |Blue Bird Transit Home colspan=\\"22\\" style=\\"background:#63A4C7\\" |Wanderlodge Forward Control/FC colspan=\\"10\\" style=\\"background:#d0d0d0;\\"  colspan=\\"10\\" style=\\"background:#d0d0d0;\\" - align=\\"center\\"  style=\\"background:#f0f0f0;\\" |Rear-engine |style=\\"background:#f0f0f0;\\" |Single-axle colspan=\\"7\\" style=\\"background:#d0d0d0;\\"  colspan=\\"10\\" style=\\"background:#d0d0d0;\\"  colspan=\\"9\\" style=\\"background:#d0d0d0;\\"  colspan=\\"4\\" style=\\"background:#63A4C7\\" |Wanderlodge SP  style=\\"background:#d0d0d0;\\"  colspan=\\"5\\" style=\\"background:#63A4C7\\" |BMC (Blue Bird Motor Coach) colspan=\\"5\\" style=\\"background:#d0d0d0;\\"  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"background:#63A4C7\\" |Wanderlodge M380 |-align=\\"center\\" | style=\\"background:#f0f0f0;\\" |Tandem-axle colspan=\\"7\\" style=\\"background:#d0d0d0;\\"  colspan=\\"10\\" style=\\"background:#d0d0d0;\\"  colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background:#d0d0d0;\\"  colspan=\\"11\\" style=\\"background:#63A4C7\\" |Wanderlodge PT colspan=\\"7\\" style=\\"background:#d0d0d0;\\"  colspan=\\"10\\" style=\\"background:#d0d0d0;\\" - align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"7\\" style=\\"background:#d0d0d0;\\"  colspan=\\"10\\" style=\\"background:#d0d0d0;\\"  colspan=\\"8\\" style=\\"background:#d0d0d0;\\"  colspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"background:#63A4C7\\" |Wanderlodge Wide Body Pusher colspan=\\"7\\" style=\\"background:#63A4C7\\" |Wanderlodge Wide Body Pusher colspan=\\"12\\" style=\\"background:#63A4C7\\"|Wanderlodge LX/LXi/M450LXi |}  Variants   Blue Bird Inn  Alongside the Blue Bird Transit Home and Wanderlodge, Blue Bird offered a second motorhome designed around the same concept. Based on a conventional-chassis bus body, the Blue Bird Inn was intended as a lower-priced entry model. However, due to low sales, the Blue Bird Inn was discontinued in the early 1970s.  Blue Bird QMC  Based on the 1994-1998 Blue Bird/Spartan Wanderlodge BMC, the Blue Bird QMC was used as a coach marketed to business users seeking a mobile command center or hospitality suite. Essentially a business jet on wheels, the QMC featured an on-board kitchen and a reconfigurable interior designed for business presentations.

The chapel was conceived and designed by the artist Tsuguharu Foujita, and is famous for the frescos he painted in the interiors. The chapel was consecrated in 1966, and in 1992 was listed as an historic monument of France. Location The chapel is situated in Reims, France on 33, rue du Champs de Mars. It is located in the gardens of the family residence of the Mumm champagne house, the then home of Ren√© Lalou who was Foujita's godfather on his conversion to Roman Catholicism. The chapel and its grounds were donated to the City of Reims on 18 October 1966. History The interior of the chapel, 2015. Foujita was a Japanese born painter who came to Paris in 1913, and is a known member of the School of Paris. After experiencing mystical enlightenment at the Abbey of Saint-Remi Basilica in Reims in 1959 he converted to Catholicism and was baptised at the Notre-Dame de Reims cathedral, on 14 October 1959. Foujita's godfather Ren√© Lalou, the then chairman of Mumm champagne, decided, together with Foujita to build a Romanesque chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Foujita drew up the plans for the chapel, and the interior and exterior decoration, including stained glass windows, reliefs, ironwork, sculptures and the frescos. In 1965, work began under the architect Maurice Clauzier and was finished in 1966. The stained glass windows were crafted by the glazer Charles Marq and the wrought iron work and sculptures by Maxime Chiquet and the Andre brothers. Over a period of three months in early June and August 1966, and at the age of 80, Foujita painted the chapel walls with religious iconography in the form of large frescos in blues, greens, browns and yellows. Although the frescos are of Christian themes, one can also find depictions of Foujita and his wife, Kimiko, and also of his friend Rene Lalou and his wife. The chapel was consecrated on 1 October 1966 and dedicated to Our Lady, Queen of Peace. It was donated to the city of Reims on 18 October 1966.

It is best known for having been the residence of the Beale family from 1924 to 1979, and specifically of mother and daughter Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale and Edith \\"Little Edie\\" Bouvier Beale from 1952 to 1977. A 1975 documentary about the two, Grey Gardens, which showed them living in squalor in the mansion, is considered one of the best documentaries of all time, and spawned a 2006 Broadway musical and a 2009 television movie, among other adaptations. The house itself dates from 1897, and was designed by Joseph Greenleaf Thorpe. Other notable owners include Ben Bradlee and Sally Quinn, who lived together in the house from 1979 to 2014, and who significantly improved its state after moving in. It is currently owned by fashion designer and entrepreneur Liz Lange. Design and early ownership In 1895, of oceanfront land was bought by F. Stanhope Phillips and Margaret Bagg Phillips, daughter of John S. Bagg, who had acquired the Detroit Free Press in 1836. The Phillips paid $2,500 () from the estate of a Mr. Candy. The couple announced their plans to build a $100,000 () house on the property. However, the purchase hit a snag when it was revealed that the property had been bequeathed to the U.S. government. In 1897, Joseph Greenleaf Thorpe (1862‚Äì1934) designed the house. Thorpe had designed several other houses in East Hampton. However, the house was not immediately built. Stanhope Phillips died in 1901, leaving behind an estate valued at $250,000 (). His brother challenged Margaret for control of the estate, saying she had used undue influence on him and that she had cremated him so that an autopsy could not be performed to confirm this. The court sided with Margaret. After the ownership issues were settled, construction on the house started. In 1913, Robert C. Hill, president of Consolidation Coal Company, bought the house. Hill's wife Anna Gilman Hill (1875‚Äì1955) imported ornate concrete walls from Spain to enclose the garden and hired landscape designer Ruth Bramley to create what would become the core of Grey Gardens. Bramley was married at the time to architect Aymar Embury II and their offices were in the same building. Beale ownership Grey Gardens, c.1916 In 1924, Phelan Beale acquired the estate for his wife Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale. Phelan was a law partner of John Vernou Bouvier Jr. and had married Bouvier's daughter, Edith. Bouvier owned an estate in East Hampton, located three miles north on Further Lane at Lasata where his granddaughter Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis was a frequent visitor. After an extended marital separation, Phelan Beale notified Edith of their divorce around 1946 by telegram from Mexico. Phelan provided Edith with an allowance of $300 () per month to maintain the property, herself and her daughter Edith Bouvier Beale, who was commonly known as \\"Little\\" Edie. Phelan's financial support eventually ceased and the two Ediths lost contact with him. The house and garden fell into disrepair and were overtaken by nature due to the lack of funds. The two women continued to inhabit the house, where they kept a large number of feral cats and wild animals. In 1972, the Suffolk County, New York Health Commission issued a notice of eviction, stating the Beales would be unable to live in the house until it was cleaned and basic utilities restored. The news of the order and of the squalor in which the two women lived received international attention because \\"Big\\" and \\"Little\\" Edie were the aunt and first cousin of Jacqueline Kennedy, widow of former US President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, and current wife of Aristotle Onassis. Jacqueline and her sister, Lee Radziwill, donated money to make the house habitable and return it to a standard which would allow for the rescission of the eviction order. In 1973, Lee Radziwill asked film-making brothers Albert and David Maysles to create a film, including interviews with the Edies, which would document the Bouvier family's visits to East Hampton during Lee's and Jacqueline's youth. The project was ultimately canceled and the Maysles turned their attention to the Beales, resulting in the 1975 documentary Grey Gardens. After the release of the film, Edith and Little Edie continued to reside in the house. Edith died in 1977 and Little Edie remained until she sold the property. Post-Beale ownership In 1979, Little Edie sold Grey Gardens to Ben Bradlee and Sally Quinn for $220,000 () with the stipulation that they were not to tear down the house. Little Edie reportedly told the couple, \\"all it needs is a coat of paint!\\" Quinn later recalled that the dilapidated house \\"was worse than the movie,\\" and was filled with waste from 52 feral cats. Bradlee and Quinn restored the home, which would be featured in several architectural and home d√©cor magazines. In February 2017, a widowed Quinn put the house up for sale with an asking price of $19,995,000. The Beale-owned furniture, along with household items owned by Quinn, were auctioned off in an estate sale held from November 17‚Äì19, 2017. On December 20, 2017, the house sold for $15.5 million to American fashion designer Liz Lange. Lange has since overseen a complete restoration of the home and its surrounding gardens by decorator Mark D. Sikes.

White, on April 15, 1847, who reached the port on September 6 and were soon followed by Robert S. Maclay who arrived on April 15 the next year.Carlson, Ellsworth C. (1974): Foochow Missionaries, 1847 - 1880 After the early struggling years on the Zhongzhou Island () on River Min, they finally moved south and settled on the Cangqian Hill in the 1850s. Gratified and encouraged by the successful completion of their first church (also the first Methodist church in East Asia) Ching Sing Tong () dedicated on August 3, 1856, the Methodist Episcopal Mission immediately went on to purchase another site which was close to the mission compound on Cangqian Hill, just in front of the lot occupied by the superintendent Rev. Robert S. Maclay. In view of the increasing number of foreigners in Fuzhou, the Mission decided to erect there a church with two audience rooms, one for speakers of the Fuzhou dialect and the other for English worship.Maclay, Robert S. (1861): Life Among the Chinese Illustration of Heavenly Peace Church in the 1850s The Chinese portion of the church was dedicated on October 18, 1856. On that day Lyman Birt Peet, Justus Doolittle and Charles Hartwell of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions also attended the services. The edifice was built of brick, resting on a stone foundation. After the English portion was dedicated on December 28 of the same year, the Church of Heavenly Peace became the first Christian church erected in Fuzhou, and also the first Methodist church in China, which conducted services in English. The services on that occasion were conducted by Rev. Erastus Wentworth who delivered a discourse on to the foreign audience. On June 14, 1857, ten years after their arrival, the Methodist Episcopal Mission baptized their first Chinese convert, a Foochow tradesman named Ting Ang (). In the early 1860s Heavenly Peace Church was put under the charge of Rev. Otis Gibson.Maclay, Robert S. (1862): China Mission, 1862 In 1866, the first annual meeting of the Methodist Episcopal Mission in China was held in the church, dividing the field of Foochow into four parishes and establishing new mission fields in Hokchiang, Hinghwa, Kucheng, Yenping, Kiukiang and Peking. On November 22, 1869, the first native Methodist deacons, known as the \\"Seven Golden Lampstands\\", were ordained in this church.Doolittle, Justus (1870), Ordination of Native Methodist Ministers at Foochow, China In 1877, Church of Heavenly Peace officially became the center of Foochow Conference. From 1877 to 1947, 55 out of the total 59 annual meetings had been held in Church of Heavenly Peace. In 1897, a renovation of the church was carried out with the fund raised by Rev. Uong De Gi () to increase its seating capacity to as much as 1000.Brief History of Heavenly Peace Church (Â§©ÂÆâÂ†ÇÂè≤Áï•), engraved upon the church's cornerstone Heavenly Peace Church in the early 20th century During the first half of the 20th century, the Church of Heavenly Peace had continued to play an instrumental role in the process of making a modern China. In 1900, Rev. Wong Nai Siong () called upon more than 600 native Foochowese, mostly church members, to migrate to Sibu, Sarawak in Malaysia. In 1913, the Chinese leader Sun Yat-sen () paid a visit to the church and gave an inspiring speech on the anti-Manchu movement and the Hsinhai Revolution. In 1920, the female evangelist Dora Yu () held a revival meeting, which nurtured the spiritual life of Watchman Nee () who was later to become one of the greatest Chinese church leaders. In the 1930s, Dr. John Sung () led several revival movements in this church. In 1947, the centennial of the Methodist Church in the Republic of China was also celebrated here. After the communist revolution in 1949, the Methodist Mission was forced to move to Taiwan with the Kuomintang government, and Church of Heavenly Peace shared with other Chinese churches the same fate of being affiliated to the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, subjugated to Communist control. Since the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, it was occupied by the government and all religious activities were strictly banned. The church was reopened in 1980 after the new religious policy was put into effect, but was, however, in a dilapidated state of disrepair. Today The reconstruction project of Heavenly Peace Church began in 1996 and was completed three years later, at a total cost of ¬•3 million. Dedicated on October 30, 1999, the newly built church stands upon a higher foundation and looks more prominent than before, with a floor area of 2,300m2.
