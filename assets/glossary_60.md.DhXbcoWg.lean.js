It therefore eschews a hierarchical description of language and its labels are based on discourse functions rather than on parts of speech (noun, verb, etc.) and syntactic roles (subject, object, etc.). In LUG, there are two types of chunks, namely those that express the message and propositions of the text (M language), and those that express organisation (O language), i.e. the structure which in other linguistic descriptions include such things as discourse markers, signposting, gambits, etc. as well as the speaker or writer's orientation, i.e. their attitude or stance to the message or to their interlocutor or reader.

The development of the fur and the flourishing of trade in manufactures, resulted from the 19th century a significant number of local residents to travel around the world and create a multitude of economically prosperous communities. Today in almost all major cities like New York, Paris, Munich, Leipzig, Germany, Spain and Italy, and elsewhere, there Kastorians that supply the global market with beautiful samples of the fur art and technique. The region of Kastoria as one of the major global processing centers of production and marketing of fur is one of the most important sectors of Greek foreign trade and the national economy.  History  The processing of Fur in Kastoria estimated that begins earlier than the 14th century when the city provided the ermine pelts for the lining of the robes of the Byzantine courtiers. From the 16th century onwards, growing demand for fur and a longer fur was widespread not only for protection from the cold but also as social promotion component. The furriers Greeks begin to import raw materials from abroad. Early traders settled in Russia and Germany. In the 18th century fur longer conquer the whole world. In 1894 it was an elegance sign since by then the processing was done manually. First introducing the stapling of cuttings technique in Kastoria, the industry of the fur started to industrialize. After Germany's division at the end of World War II, the fur center moved from Leipzig to Frankfurt. By the end of the World War II, the industry has been a great development thanks to the right technique and artistry of Kastorian furriers, making the region the main international fur processing center. During the Greek Civil War in the late 1940s, thousands of Kastorians migrated to the United States to take the place of aging Jewish immigrants who had formed the core of New York furriers. In 1984, 25,000 Kastorians were working and living in the area of New York, and 10,000 in Frankfurt. Today the branch of fur ensure the responsible use of a renewable natural source raw materials.

Additional 0.64% of the population is made up of Serbs- Montenegrins () and Montenegrins-Serbs (). Serbs are a native population of Old Montenegro, Old Herzegovina, Brda, Ra≈°ka, Bay of Kotor and Zeta. History During the Slavic migrations of the 6th and 7th centuries, the territory of modern-day Montenegro was settled by Serbs, who created several principalities in the region. In southern parts of modern Montenegro, Principality of Duklja was formed, while western parts belonged to the Principality of Travunija. Northern parts of modern Montenegro belonged to the inner Principality of Serbia. All of those early polities were described in historiographical works of Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenetos (944-959). In 1018, all of Serbian principalities came under the supreme rule of the Byzantine Empire. Regions of Duklja and Travunija broke away from Byzantine rule c. 1034-1042, under prince Stefan Vojislav, founder of the Vojislavljeviƒá dynasty. His son Mihailo I Vojislavljeviƒá (d. 1081) liberated Zahumlje and inner Serbia, creating a united Serbian polity and taking the title of king (c. 1077). The reign of his son, King Constantine Bodin (d. 1100), was followed by a period of regional fragmentation, lasting throughout much of the 12th century. After 1180, all of what is today Montenegro came under the rule of Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja, the founder of the Nemanjiƒá dynasty. The region of Zeta, formerly known as Duklja, became a crown land of the united Serbian state. It was given to Vukan Nemanjiƒá (d. 1208), the oldest son of Stefan Nemanja, and later to crown prince Stefan Radoslav, son of King Stefan Nemanjiƒá, who succeeded his father as Serbian King in 1228. Thus it became a custom to grant the region to the heir of the throne or some other member of the royal family. In 1219, two dioceses of the Serbian Orthodox Church were created on the territory of modern-day Montenegro, Eparchy of Zeta centered in the Monastery of Holy Archangel Michael on Prevlaka, and Eparchy of Budimlja centered in the Monastery of ƒêurƒëevi Stupovi. Several other monasteries also date to this period, such as: Moraƒça, Praskvica, Vranjina, and others. Serbian Despotate is the last independent medieval Serb state and it included most of modern-day Montenegro. Saint Sava, born in Duklja, was a Serbian prince and the first Archbishop of the autocephalous Serbian Church Montenegro saw independence under the Petroviƒá-Njego≈° dynasty, at first as a principality and then as a kingdom. Both the Kingdom of Serbia and the Kingdom of Montenegro fought together as independent states in the Balkan Wars and in the First World War. At the end of the war in 1918 tensions arose between the two states as the Montenegrin Whites with Serbian support deposed Nicholas I of Montenegro and proclaimed Montenegro's unification with Serbia as part of Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (renamed into Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929), while the Montenegrin Greens opposed it. The conflict led to the Christmas Uprising, in which the Whites with support from the Serbian army defeated the Greens. During the period of the monarchic Yugoslavia, ruled by the Serbian Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá dynasty, the tensions between Serbs and Croats were increasing and most of the Montenegrin politicians supported the Serbian proposed centralised state. Serbian Kingdom from 1217 to 1346, led by the Nemanjiƒá dynasty During the Second World War both Serbs and Montenegrins were very active in both resistance movements, the Yugoslav Partisans and the Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland known as the Chetniks. At the end of the war the socialist Yugoslavia was created and the two became republics within the Yugoslav federation. Yugoslav Partisan Milovan ƒêilas described himself as a Montenegrin Serb and described Montenegro as the spiritual homeland of Serbs, saying \\"I am not a Montenegrin because I am a Serb, but a Serb because I am a Montenegrin. We Montenegrins are the salt of the Serbs. All the strength of the Serbs is not here [in Montenegro] but their soul is.\\"Elizabeth Roberts. Realm of the Black Mountain: A History of Montenegro. London, England, UK: Cornell University Press, 2007. Pp. 1. ƒêilas also has said \\"The Montenegrins are, despite provincial and historical differences, quintessentially Serbs, and Montenegro the cradle of Serbian myths and of aspirations for the unification of Serbs.\\". After the secession of Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia in 1991 and 1992, SR Montenegro held the Montenegrin referendum in 1992 which ended with a 95.96% of votes in favour for a state union with Serbia and with the changing of the socialist political system towards a multi-party one. The country was renamed Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In this period between 1990 and 1998 Montenegro was ruled by Momir Bulatoviƒá who had close relations with the Serbian president Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá and who was very supportive to keep close ties between the two republics within the state union. Montenegro was also included by the economic sanctions imposed on Serbia during the 1990s. During the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia both Serbia and Montenegro suffered the attacks of the NATO forces and several targets inside Montenegro were also bombarded. All this contributed to the rise in power in Montenegro of Milo ƒêukanoviƒá who was known to be much less sympathetic towards the Serbo-Montenegrin ties and would become an open supporter of the independence of Montenegro. In 2003, three years after the fall of Milo≈°eviƒá in 2000, and after insisting on international diplomacy, the former Yugoslavia became known as the state union of Serbia and Montenegro. The process of becoming a single state union ironically lead to the separation of the two states - a change which was officiated by the referendum on Montenegrin independence on 21 May 2006. A total of 419,240 votes were cast, representing 86.5% of the total electorate. Of them, 230,661 votes or 55.5% were in favour of independence and 185,002 votes or 44.5% were against. Nemanjiƒá dynasty Serbia in the late XIII century and contemporary borders of Montenegro. 1.King Milutin's Serbia; 2.King Dragutin's Serbia; 3.Contemporary Montenegro; Since independence, the Montenegrin society has been divided among many issues. The independence supporters are advocating for the creation of a separate Montenegrin language, regarded before as a dialect of the Serbian language, including the creation of a new Montenegrin Cyrillic alphabet which shares the same letters with the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet except for the addition of two new letters. The Serb population of Montenegro is opposed to the idea of a linguistic separation, just as they are opposed to the separation of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church from the jurisdiction of the Serbian Orthodox Church. The Montenegrin language lacks an ISO code, and the Montenegrin Orthodox church is canonically unrecognized. In 2006, the NGO Serbian People's Council of Montenegro was created, headed by Momƒçilo Vuksanoviƒá, and in 2008 an official representative electoral body of Serbs in Montenegro was formed as the Serbian National Council of Montenegro, with Momƒçilo Vuksanoviƒá as president.NARS (2010): Fourteenth Sitting of the Committee on Relations with Serbs Living Outside Serbia The links between the two nations remain strong, and the fact that for the last two centuries a great number of Montenegrins had emigrated to Serbia further strengthens the ties. The Montenegrin littoral is still the main tourist destination for citizens of Serbia, and a large population of Serbians own property in Montenegro. Many of these properties consist of summer homes, and contribute to a seasonal influx of Serbs in Montenegro, during the summers. Despite the geopolitical separation, the economic balance and relationship shared between the two countries continues to be strong. Culture Language Miroslav Gospel created by order of Miroslav of Hum, Montenegrin Serb ruler. The national language of Montenegro has historically and traditionally been called Serbian.cf. Roland Sussex, Paul Cubberly, The Slavic Languages, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 2006; esp. v. pp. 73: \\"Serbia had used Serbian as an official language since 1814, and Montenegro even earlier.\\". According to Pavle Iviƒá, two sub-dialects of the Shtokavian dialect (of the Serbian language) were spoken in Montenegro: the Eastern Herzegovinian dialect and Zeta-South Sanjak dialect. The Eastern Herzegovinian dialect is spoken in Montenegro, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. Today, the national standard is based on the Zeta-South Sanjak dialect. Some 42.9% of the population of the country speak Serbian as their mother tongue, including 37% of the declared Montenegrins. Serbian was the official language of Montenegro until 2007 when the new Constitution of Montenegro replaced the Constitution of 1992. Amid opposition from pro-Serbian parties, Montenegrin language was made the sole official language of the country and Serbian was given the status of a recognised minority language along with Bosnian, Albanian, and Croatian. Since 2006, both in linguistic and other aspects of cultural life, ethnic Serbs of Montenegro have been exposed to gradual \\"non-coercive\\" \\"Montenegrinisation\\".Financial Times (2007): Neil MacDonald, Montenegro‚Äôs ethnicity debate intensifies Religion The Serbs are adherents of the Serbian Orthodox Church, the strongest religious institution of Montenegro (with a total of 460,383 followers or 74%).see: Religion in Montenegro One of the largest places of worship is the Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ in Podgorica. The future of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Montenegro has been threatened by the newly formed Montenegrin Orthodox Church which has claimed Serbian Orthodox churches in Montenegro, and is backed by a small percentage of the Orthodox Christians in Montenegro. The government has recognized the church, however none of the Eastern Orthodox churches have. The leader is the controversial Mira≈° Dedeiƒá, a former Serbian Orthodox clergyman with Serbian nationalist views that after being suspended from the Serbian Church, went to Rome and became a Greek Orthodox clergyman. He was later suspended by the Serbian Orthodox Church after committing adultery with a younger woman. In 1997 he was excommunicated by the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Orthodox Patriarchate of Constantinople from the Eastern Orthodox Church. The leader of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church is anathemized by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and banished from Orthodoxy. Folk attire A Montenegrin cap with the Serbian cross. The Montenegrin cap is a traditional cap worn by Montenegrins and Montenegrin Serbs, originally in the shape of a flat cylinder, having a red upper surface (called tepeluk) not dissimilar to the Herzegovina and Lika caps. It was wholly red until Prince-Bishop Petar II Petroviƒá Njego≈° surrounded it with a black rim (called derevija),\\"Crna Gora i Crnogorci\\" by Vuk Stefanoviƒá Karad≈æiƒá and the definition given was as a sign of grief of occupied Kosovo. The Kosovo Myth was very popular in the Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro. The enforcement of the cap upon the Montenegrin chieftains by Peter II was a mark of expression of then's dominating Serbian national identity.\\"O najstarijoj kapi kod Jugoslovena...\\" by Miodrag Vlahoviƒá The national telling recorded the most often version of the cap as following: the black wrapper was sign of grief for the once big Empire, the red the bloody defeat at the Battle of KosovoCrna Gora... Narodni ≈æivot i obiƒçaji\\" by Andrija Joviƒáeviƒá and the five small stripes on the top represent the remaining remains of the once greater Serbian realm,\\"Crnogorska mu≈°ka kapa\\" by Zorica Raduloviƒá which became increasingly popular amongst the common folk during the reign of Prince Danilo I Petroviƒá- Njego≈°. Within the stripes is angled a six star, representing the last free part, Montenegro, shining upon the fallen and conquered.\\"Fizicki lik i izgled Njegosa\\" by Jovan Vukmanoviƒá Worn by the rulers and chieftains, the version with the Four Ocil symbol in the star's place had become across the years with growth of nationalism excessively popular amongst the ordinary people, the symbol of the Serbian Orthodox Church, which effectively worked on maintaining and raising the national identity.

W.. (1980). Middle Byzantine Churches of Kastoria: Dates and Implications. The Art Bulletin, 62(2), 190‚Äì207. Historically, the city has been ruled by many entities, including the Serbian Empire and the Ottoman Empire. The amount of Byzantine and post-Byzantine churches proves the development and richness of the city through the different ages. Kastoria originally had 72 Byzantine and medieval churches, of which 54 have survived, including St Athanasius of Mouzaki. Seven of these are from the Byzantine period. Some of them have been restored and provide useful insight into trends in Late Byzantine styles of architecture and fresco painting. Nowadays, Kastoria is an important religious centre for the Greek Orthodox Church and is the seat of a metropolitan bishop. The Metropolis of Kastoria is one of the metropolises of the New Lands in Greece, administered as part of the Church of Greece.  Panagia Koumpelidiki  Panagia Koumbelidiki church in Kastoria Panagia Koumpelidiki is one of the oldest churches in the town and is considered to be both typical and unique. There is no information left on the name of the patron, the architect or the reason for the building of the church. Many opinions exist on the age of the church. While all dating efforts until today have failed, archaeologists managed to define a timeframe within which the church was built. Based on this time frame, the church is placed between the 9th and 11th century. The church is a Triconch Temple, located in the acropolis of Kastoria, inside the Justinian Walls, and is the only one in town with a dome, from which it took its name. Koumpelidiki comes from the Turkish word koubeb meaning \\"dome\\" or \\"domed building\\". The name of the church means \\"Church of the Virgin with the Little Dome\\" and it is devoted to the Virgin Mary. It is a small church, its size is typical to a chapel in a traditional Byzantine church. Another typical feature is a cloisonn√© masonry of the exterior. Like the other Kastoria churches, Panagia's interior has fresco paintings rather than mosaics. The original interior decoration dates back to the period 1260-1280. Two more layers of wall paintings followed, one in the 15th and one in the 17th century. The external wall painting are placed in 1496. In the arch of the inner narthex stands the most remarkable and rare piece of wall painting, the depiction of the Holly Trinity. This mural reflects the doctrine of the Catholic Church, according to which the Holy Spirit proceeds 'from Father and Son', a fact that leads us to conclude that the painter was directly connected with the Western Church and deeply influenced by it. In 1940, the church was bombed by the Italian forces, leading to the destruction of the dome.

He is the bishop of the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter, a community for former Anglican clergy and laypeople within the Catholic Church. Early life and education A native of Fremont, California, Lopes was born on April 22, 1975, the only child of Jos√© de Oliveira Lopes and Barbara Jane Lopes. His father was from Portugal and his mother from Poland. He was educated at Catholic schools in California: St. Pius School in Redwood City, St Edward's School in Newark, and Moreau Catholic High School in Hayward. Lopes studied at the St. Ignatius Institute at the University of San Francisco, and also pursued studies at the University of Innsbruck in Austria. His philosophical studies and preparation for the priesthood took place at St. Patrick‚Äôs Seminary in Menlo Park, California, before he was assigned to study theology in Rome. There he obtained a licentiate at the Pontifical Gregorian University while living at the Pontifical North American College. Ordained ministry Lopes was ordained to the diaconate on October 5, 2000, during a Mass at St. Peter's Basilica, Rome. He was ordained a priest on June 23, 2001, for the Archdiocese of San Francisco by William Levada. He served in two parishes in California as an associate pastor; St. Patrick's Catholic Church, San Francisco, and St. Anselm Catholic Church in Ross, California. Lopes returned to Rome to obtain a doctorate in sacred theology from the Gregorian University. Since 2005, he has served as an official of the Holy See's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, while also serving as a professor of theology at the Gregorian. During that time, he served as a personal aide to William Cardinal Levada, who was prefect for the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith from 2005 to 2012. On July 10, 2010, he was appointed a Chaplain of His Holiness and therefore was then addressed as \\"Monsignor\\". Starting in 2012, Lopes served as the secretary of the Vatican commission Anglicanae Traditiones, which was formed with the goal of developing a missal that would blend Anglican and Roman Rite liturgical elements for the use of the personal ordinariates. Episcopal ministry On November 24, 2015, the Holy See announced that Pope Francis had appointed Lopes as the first bishop of the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter, a church structure for Catholics in the US and Canada who were formerly Anglicans. This announcement coincided with the first Sunday on which the ordinariates began celebrating Mass using Divine Worship: The Missal, developed while Lopes was serving on the Anglicanae Traditiones commission in Rome. As ordinary, Lopes succeeded Jeffrey N. Steenson, a former Episcopal bishop appointed by Pope Benedict XVI in 2012. On February 2, 2016, he was consecrated a bishop in Houston and took canonical possession of the ordinariate. Lopes is the first bishop to lead any of the three ordinariates.

It is a rhizomatous perennial, from the cliffs and forest glades on the mountains of Turkey. It has straight or falcate shaped leaves, stem with several branches, the stem has purple spathes (leaves of the flower bud), it has up to 8 fragrant flowers, in various colours between yellow (white, pale yellow, pale brown and tan) or blue (purple, lavender, pale blue to ice blue). It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. Description It has broad rhizomes that have secondary roots, that can form clumps of plants. It has straight or slightly falcate (or sickle shaped), grey-green leaves, although the base of the leaves is purple violet. They can grow up to between long, and between 1.5 and 2.5 cm wide. Similar to Iris junonia, it is herbaceous, the leaves die in the winter, when they re-grow in the spring. It has a slender stem or peduncle, that can grow up to between tall. It is normally taller than the foliage. The stem has several branches, (or pedicels), normally 2‚Äì4, the lower branches are long and the upper branches are sessile. The stem has obtuse or rounded, inflated, spathes that are very heavily stained purple. Hence, the name Iris purpureobractea. They can grow up to long. The stems (and the many branches) hold up to 8 flowers, in spring, between March or April, to May, or (rarely) July. The fragrant flowers, are in diameter. They are variable in colour, which come in shades of blue or yellow. The blue ranges from purple, lavender, ice-blue, and pale blue. The yellow ranges from white, off-white, to pale yellow, straw yellow, tan, pale brown. There are occasionally blended or bi-toned flowers, such as white and purple forms. The blue forms, have a darker centre patch, or veined with purple. The yellow forms can be pale yellow with greenish-brown veining, they also have bracts that are not so intensely purple stained.British Iris Society (1997) The yellow forms of Iris junonia,Kelly Norris and yellow forms of Iris imbricata are similar in form to the yellow forms of Iris purpureobractea, also forms of Iris germanica in the Taurus mountains near Egirdir are very similar to the iris.Basak Gardner & Chris Gardner Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The falls are obovate shaped, cuneate (wedge shaped) at the base, they are long, and between 2.8‚Äì3.5 cm wide. In the centre of the fall, is a strip of thick hairs (the beard), which is white tipped with yellow, or orange. The standards are obovate (shaped) with a narrow claw (section of the petal closest to the stem), they are long, and between 2.5‚Äì4 cm wide. It has style branch, that is 3‚Äì4 cm long and 1.2‚Äì1.6 cm wide. After the iris has flowered, it produces an oblong seed capsule, that is long and 1.5 cm wide. Biochemistry In 1989, a karyological study was carried out on 4 iris species in Turkey; including Iris junonia Schott et Kotschy ex Schott, Iris purpureobractea B. Matthew et T.Baytop, Iris taochia Woronow ex Grossh., and Iris schachtii. It found the chromosome counts of the iris species. It was also found that Iris purpureobractea has a complex karyology and plant morphology. As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. Iris purpureobractea is a diploid, and has a count of 2n = 48, It is also recorded as 2n=24,48,49 and 72. Taxonomy The Latin specific epithet purpureobractea refers to the purple bracts of the iris.D. Gledhill The plant was collected on Honaz Dag, by Professor Asuman Baytop of the Faculty of Pharmacy, Istanbul University. Asuman was Turhan Baytop's wife and fellow botanist. It was first published and described (with a colour photograph) by Mathew and Baytop in 'The Garden' (published in London) Vol.107, issue11 page 445-448 in 1982. It is a bearded iris, that was classified as belonging to the subgenus of 'Iris subgenus Iris', (which was formerly known as Section Pogoniris (Spach) Baker). It is a relative of Iris junonia, another bearded iris in the mountains of Adana and I√ßel provinces of Turkey. It closely resembles a miniature tall bearded iris. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003, then updated on 3 December 2004. It is listed in the Encyclopedia of Life. Iris purpureobractea is a 'tentatively' accepted name by the RHS.Last-listed in the RHS Plant Finder in 1999 Tentatively accepted name Distribution and habitat It is native to temperate Asia. Range It is an endemic, found in north, northwest, western and south-western, and Turkey (within the provinces of Denizli, Mugla, Sakararya, Usak and in Bolu Province). It is also found in the geographical region of the Eastern Anatolia Region, where it is found with Iris junonia, Iris taochia and Iris schachtii. It is also found on Honaz Mountain in Denizli Province. Habitat It grows on the mountains (made of volcanic rock), in scrub lands, on rock slopes, on cliff sides, or on plateaus, within open glades in forests (made up of cedar and pine trees). They can be found at an altitude of above sea level. Synecology Within the open glades in forests in Turkey, Iris purpureobractea grows with other bulbs such as, colchicums, snowdrops, Tulipa armena, Tulipa undulatifolia, Fritillaria whittallii and Fritillaria elwesii, Sternbergia candida, Hyacinthella siirtensis (Siirt hyacinth), Iris xanthospuria and crocuses, (including Crocus baytopiorum (Baytop's crocus), Crocus abantensis (Abant crocus), Crocus antalyensis (Antalya crocus), Crocus asumania (Asuman crocus), Crocus watti (the Watts crocus)). It also grows with Paeonia mascula, under pine trees (Pinus), oak trees and Cedrus libani (cedar of Lebanon). Conservation It is a rare plant, with only a few wild colonies of plants, especially around the provinces of Denizli and Mugla in Turkey. It is listed in the IUCN Red List as 'least threatened'. Cultivation It is hardy to close to ‚àí15 ¬∞C, which means it is hardy enough to grow in France. It prefers to grow in well- drained soils, in locations in full sun. It can be grown in rock gardens, but can be damaged by slugs and aphids. Propagation Irises can generally be propagated by division, or by seed growing. Hybrids and cultivars It can be used in hybridization, used like Iris aphylla, except that it has yellow pigmentation and purple bract/spathe colouring. It can be crossed with various other bearded irises. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), and if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Handling the plant may cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C. Smolinske Culture In Mozambique, released in 17 June 2002, as part of a set of postage stamps about flora, there was a stamp that shows an illustration of the iris. References Sources * Davis, P.

She is the first female combat pilot of Pakistan to die in a crash on duty. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2v_wbhnvn0 Early life and career Marium Mukhtiar Shaikh was the daughter of Col. (Ret'd.) Dr. Mukhtiar Ahmed Shaikh, AMC, and her ancestors were from Pano Akil, Sindh, from a well-known Sindhi Shaikh family. She got school education from Mehran Model School & College Pano Akil. She completed her intermediate from Army Public School and College (APSACS) Malir Cantt Karachi and played football for Balochistan United in the National Women Football Championship. Marium Mukhtiar graduated as a fighter pilot in the Pakistan Air Force in 2014, along with six other women in 132 GD(P) course.Before joining PAF,she was enrolled in Civil Engineering at NED University. She also took active participation in charity work. She supported a school for children who were unable to afford education. Death On Tuesday 24 November 2015, Mariam Mukhtiar Shaikh and Squadron leader Saqib Abbasi were on their routine operational training mission when their plane FT-7PG crashed near Kundian, Mianwali, Punjab. Both occupants ejected from the cockpit and the plane crash-landed. Abbasi suffered minor injuries in the accident, however Mukhtiar died of her injuries in a military hospital. Marium Mukhtiar ejected along with her co-pilot, but at too low an altitude, an air force spokesman said. She was losing height so when she ejected, she did not have appropriate height that is necessary for ejection,‚Äù the spokesman said. Her co-pilot, Squadron Leader Saqib Abbasi, survived with minor injuries, possibly because he managed to eject seconds earlier. Mukhtiar‚Äôs death was declared a martyrdom (or \\"shahadat\\") by the PAF, which said both pilots \\"handled the serious emergency with professionalism and courage and tried to save the ill-fated aircraft until the very last minute. Flying Officer Mukhtiar could save her life had she ejected herself before taking PAF FT-7PG out of populous area but both pilots decided to take risk to keep flying the downing jet for taking the jet out of the densely populated area, especially saving a school. The delay in ejection caused martyrdom of Marium Mukhtar, said PAF experienced and retired officers. She is buried in Malir Cantonment Graveyard. Awards The Pakistan Senate Standing Committee on Defence (SSCD) recommended Marium Mukhtiar for a state award. She has been awarded the military award Tamgha-e-Basalat by the Government of Pakistan.

A folk legend holds that in October 1593 a soldier of the Spanish Empire (named Gil P√©rez in a 1908 version) was mysteriously transported from Manila in the Philippines to the Plaza Mayor (now the Z√≥calo) in Mexico City. The soldier's claim to have come from the Philippines was disbelieved by the Mexicans until his account of the assassination of G√≥mez P√©rez Dasmari√±as was corroborated months later by the passengers of a ship which had crossed the Pacific Ocean with the news. Folklorist Thomas Allibone Janvier in 1908 described the legend as \\"current among all classes of the population of the City of Mexico\\".Janvier 1908, p.66 Twentieth-century paranormal investigators giving credence to the story have offered teleportation and alien abduction as explanations. Story On October 24, 1593, the soldier was doing his job guarding the Palacio del Gobernador in Manila in the Captaincy General of the Philippines. The night before, Governor G√≥mez P√©rez Dasmari√±as was assassinated by Chinese pirates, but the guards still guarded the palace and awaited the appointment of a new governor. The soldier began to feel dizzy and exhausted. He leaned against the wall and rested for a moment with his eyes closed. When he opened his eyes a few seconds later, he found himself in Mexico City, in the Viceroyalty of Mexico, thousands of kilometres across the ocean. Some guards found him in the wrong uniform and began to question who he was. The news of the assassination of the Governor of the Philippines was still unknown to the people in Mexico City. The transported soldier was reportedly wearing the palace guards' uniform in Manila and knew of his death. (In fact, P√©rez Dasmari√±as was killed at sea some distance from Manila.) The authorities placed him in jail for being a deserter and with charges of being a servant of the devil. Months later, news of the governor's death came to Mexico on a galleon from the Philippines. One of the passengers recognized the imprisoned soldier and said that he had seen him in the Philippines a day after the death of the Governor. He was eventually released from jail by the authorities and allowed to go back home. Development Thomas Allibone Janvier, an American folklorist living in Mexico, recounted the story as Legend of the Living Spectre in the December 1908 edition of Harper's Magazine, naming the soldier as Gil P√©rez. The story was one of a series entitled Legends of the City of Mexico published in a collected volume in 1910. Janvier notes that similar motifs are common in folklore. Washington Irving's Tales of the Alhambra includes the story \\"Governor Manco and the Soldier\\", which bears similarities to the legend.Janvier 1910, p.159 Janvier's 1908 account was based on a Spanish version by Mexican folklorist , published in his 1900 collection (\\"Old Mexico: historical notes, folklore, legends and customs\\") under the title (\\"An apparition\\"). Obreg√≥n traces the story to a 1698 account by Fray of the Spanish conquest of the Philippines, which recounts the story as fact; San Agustin does not name the soldier and ascribed his transportation to witchcraft.de Morga 1890, p.31 (fn.2) Janvier says Obreg√≥n asserts that in 1609, Antonio de Morga had written that P√©rez Dasmari√±as' death was known in Mexico the same day, though de Morga expresses ignorance of how this came to be.Janvier 1910, pp.159‚Äì160de Morga 1890, p.36 (fn.1) Jos√© Rizal notes many other miraculous stories from the Spanish Philippines of the time; Luis Weckmann makes the same point in relation to Spanish Mexico. A 1936 collection, (\\"Stories of the living and the dead\\") by Obreg√≥n's successor , included a version of the story entitled (\\"He came by air, he left by sea\\"). Several writers have offered paranormal explanations for the story. Morris K. Jessup and Brinsley Le Poer Trench, 8th Earl of Clancarty, suggested alien abduction, while Colin Wilson and Gary Blackwood suggested teleportation.

The series was written by Peter Bowker, directed by Euros Lyn and produced by Matt Strevens for Kudos Film & Television Company. The first episode was broadcast on BBC One on 24 November 2015. The story centres on a fictional Pepys Road in South London (although there are two actual Pepys Roads in South London - namely in Raynes Park and New Cross) and the lives of people with connections to it. Once an ordinary residential area, the value of each house in the street is approaching ¬£2 million. Its residents range from those who were born there to the newly wealthy who have only recently moved in. They all begin to receive postcards which say \\"We want what you have\\". They react to this in different ways. Production Describing how he became involved with the production, writer Peter Bowker said, \\"I was already reading Capital when Derek Wax (Executive Producer), who I've worked with before, sent me it. It hadn't occurred to me that it could be adapted because so much of it is people's internal dialogue and thoughts, so I thought the challenge of that would be intriguing. I've admired John Lanchester's writing as an economist so to begin with I was just excited to meet him! Then the more I read the book the more I thought it was similar to Dickens, both in terms of catching a moment of time and how the big decisions filter in to everyday life. If you start with the people at the bottom, who absorb the impact of those decisions, there's something dramatic there. So that's how it started.\\" Cast Main Cast * Adeel Akhtar ‚Äì Ahmed Kamal, corner-shop-keeper * Danny Ashok ‚Äì Shahid Kamal, Ahmed's brother * Alexander Arnold ‚Äì Parker, Smitty's assistant * Shabana Azmi ‚Äì Mrs. Kamal - mother of Ahmed, Shahid and Usman * Zrinka Cvite≈°iƒá ‚Äì Matya, the Younts' family nanny * Bryan Dick ‚Äì DI Mill, detective investigating the We Want What You Have campaign * Robert Emms ‚Äì Smitty/Graham Leatherby, artist and grandson of Petunia * Emma Fielding ‚Äì Strauss - the Kamal family's lawyer * Mona Goodwin ‚Äì Rohinka, wife of Ahmed * Andrew Gower ‚Äì Mark, a banker and colleague of Roger's * Kobna Holdbrook-Smith ‚Äì Mashinko, churchgoer and love interest to Quentina * Hamza Jeetooa ‚Äì Usman Kamal, Ahmed's brother * Gemma Jones ‚Äì Petunia Howe, an elderly widow who has lived in Pepys Road since she married as a young woman * Rad Kaim ‚Äì Bogdan, a Polish builder * Matthew Marsh ‚Äì Lothar, Roger's superior at PinkerLloyd * Wunmi Mosaku ‚Äì Quentina, a traffic warden * Lesley Sharp ‚Äì Mary Leatherby, Petunia's daughter * Rachael Stirling ‚Äì Arabella Yount, Roger's wife * Toby Jones ‚Äì Roger Yount, banker Recurring Cast * Kaiya Bakrania ‚Äì Fatima, Ahmed and Rohinka's daughter * Arthur Bateman ‚Äì Conrad, Roger and Arabella's eldest son * Noma Dumezweni ‚Äì Greaves, an immigration official on Quentina's case * Krystian Godlewski ‚Äì Piotr, Bogdan's colleague and roommate * Tom Reed ‚Äì Iqbal, an old friend of Shahid's Plot The central characters all have a connection to Pepys Road, a fictional street in an unidentified south London suburb. The houses in the street were once ordinary family homes in an unremarkable residential district, but thanks to London‚Äôs ever-increasing property values they are now properties worth millions. Their residents include those such as wealthy banker Roger Yount (played by Toby Jones) who have recently bought their homes, as well as people who have lived in the street since before its houses became so valuable, such as elderly widow Petunia Howe (played by Gemma Jones) who moved there as a young bride. They all start to receive postcards saying \\"We want what you have\\", which some residents interpret as a threat, but which others initially ignore. Critical reception Reviewing the first episode in UK newspaper The Guardian, Sam Wollaston began by asking \\"How much of a city of 8.5 million can you get into one south London street? Capital (BBC1), adapted from John Lanchester's novel, manages a lot\\". He added that \\"[‚Ä¶] Lanchester ‚Äì and in turn Peter Bowker and Euros Lyn, who have adapted and directed so excellently ‚Äì have managed to squeeze an incredible amount into one street, one book, and then further squeeze into three hours of television. A lot of the important stuff, as well as what is most wonderful and most terrible about the place\\". Wollaston found the episode's evocation of life in a London street to be \\"instantly recognizable\\" and concluded, \\"It's not just a brilliant allegorical portrait of London. There are stories to tell, the postcards keep coming [‚Ä¶] We're heading for a crash, big bang, meltdown\\". In The Daily Telegraph, Ben Lawrence gave the opening episode four out of five stars. He began his review by noting that he had found the novel on which it is based \\"[‚Ä¶] a disappointment. This was no Dickensian bird‚Äôs-eye view, but an overly schematic tangle of under- developed plotlines populated by underwritten characters\\". By contrast, he thought the television adaptation showed \\"an eternal London, riven by inequality and quickened by diversity\\". He was particularly impressed by the cast, writing \\"[‚Ä¶] it‚Äôs the acting that makes this production sing. There was not a bad performance among the large ensemble cast and each brought something very different\\". He praised Toby Jones' \\"fine line in quiet desperation\\" as banker Roger Yount, and Rachael Stirling‚Äôs portrayal of his wife Arabella, but judged that \\"The standout performances came from Gemma Jones, as pensioner Petunia Howe, a working-class Londoner who had become an accidental millionaire by sitting steadily in her Edwardian terraced house and Wunmi Mosaku as Quentina Mkfesi, a Zimbabwean asylum seeker working illegally as a traffic warden and facing deportation. Both actresses ably captured the loneliness of London life\\". Writing in The Independent, Daisy Wyatt decided that, \\"Fans of John Lanchester's best-selling novel Capital will be pleased with the BBC adaptation starring Toby Jones and Lesley Sharp. Not only does the three-part drama revisit such brilliantly painted characters, it does so with admirable faithfulness\\". However, she felt that \\"[‚Ä¶] for viewers unfamiliar with the book, it may not have quite enough intrigue to keep them coming back for more\\", but concluded overall, \\"That said, the drama is a pleasing adaptation that brings life to lovable characters, with strong performances from the ensemble cast\\". Ben Dowell, writing in Radio Times described Capital as a \\"sparkling and hugely relevant new drama\\". He found that, \\"This is for the most part a very believable London (except for the summery trees bedecked with leaves during a scene purporting to be Christmas). It shows Londoners trying to work out very real problems. It‚Äôs a world where people who think they lead very separate lives are shown to be very connected ‚Äì often without wanting it\\" before concluding that, \\"[‚Ä¶] as you expect from Bowker (writer of the Bafta-winning Marvellous), there is a fierce intelligence at work here, a script which asks some very interesting and important questions but doesn‚Äôt force the answers down your throat\\". Awards In November 2016, Capital won the best TV movie/mini series award at the 44th International Emmy Awards.

Economics (1979) ** University of the Philippines, Ph.D. Economics Program (1981-1982) ** University of Hawaii, Ph.D. Economics (1986)  Career  Bruce left his boyhood home after the declaration of Martial Law in 1972. Pursued by the martial law military, he escaped to Marawi in Mindanao where he found his interests shifting from communications to economics as he became more and more involved in rural development. After graduate school at Xavier University in Cagayan de Oro, Mindanao, and University of Hawaii in Honolulu, Bruce returned to the Philippines and began work in the government with a focus on policy- reform processes. He was part of the group that put together the Philippines' membership in the World Trade Organization. He was also on the team that developed the initial draft of the Agri-Agra Reform Law as well as that of the Local Government Code of 1992. In the 1980s, Bruce was appointed first executive director of the Agricultural Credit Policy Council (ACPC) jointly appointed by former Central Bank Governor Jobo Fernandez and former Agriculture Secretary Ramon Mitra Jr. His function was as lead technical adviser for a rehabilitation program for all of the rural banks that had been organized, and subsequently failed, during the Masagana 99 era of subsidized loans for rice and corn production. He served as Assistant Secretary, then Undersecretary of Agriculture (for Policy, Planning, and International Trade) of the Department of Agriculture of the Philippines from 1986 to 1993. From 2007 to 2012, he served in various positions within The Asia Foundation, including Chief Economist and Country Representative for Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. From 2012 to 2018 he served as Deputy Director-General of the International Rice Research Institute, based in Los Ba√±os, Laguna and also elected Secretary IRRI Board of Trustees.IRRI Profile As of 2018, Bruce is the newest member of the Monetary Board, the central bank's highest policy-making body.  Food Security  With more than 35 years of progressive experience in governance, management, analysis, and planning socio-economic development reforms and initiatives, Bruce has been the go-to guy for many agri and food security related projects. According to Bruce, food security is a regional, even international effort. \\"Agriculture‚Äîwhich produces food‚Äîcannot be confined to the artificial borders of countries. Food is a product of human ingenuity applied to natural resources‚Äîland, water, sunlight, rainfall‚Äîthat also spill across borders. Some countries, especially the large countries like the US, China, India, have more than enough food. Many other, smaller countries‚Äîsuch as Singapore, Malaysia, Korea‚Äîare largely dependent on food produced by others. With worsening climate change and resource degradation, as populations continue to grow, open international trade and global cooperation is becoming even more imperative to ensure that all populations of all nations share in the bounty of the earth as a whole.\\"  Personal life  Bruce is married to Rory Francisco-Tolentino, former Director of Philippine Business for Social Progress and Ayala Foundation and current consultant for various nonprofit management projects. He has two children, Josh Tolentino and Ma. Amanda Tolentino-Santos.

Although the turn to networked individualism started before the advent of the internet, it has been fostered by the development of social media networks. Origin of the term The term was coined by Barry Wellman in 2000,Barry Wellman, ‚ÄúLiving Wired in a Networked World: The Rise of Networked Individualism.‚Äù Founding conference, Association of Internet Researchers, Lawrence, KS, Sept 2000 and first published by Manuel Castells and Barry Wellman in 2001.Barry Wellman, ‚ÄúPhysical Place and Cyber Place: The Rise of Networked Individualism.‚Äù International Journal of Urban and Regional Research 25,2 (June, 2001): 227-52. It was elaborated on by Lee Rainie and Barry Wellman in their 2012 book Networked: The New Social Operating System (MIT Press). Definition The networked individuals are members of diverse groups in which they seek different things; for instance, the same set of individuals could be in a group used to seek emotional support while another group might be used to get good addresses in a city. Those groups can be dispersed around the globe, and the combination of those networks make for a highly individualized, and well-networked, person. This new world of networked individualism is oriented around looser, more fragmented networks that provide on-demand succor. Such networks had already formed before the coming of the internet. In incorporating the internet and mobile phones into their lives, people have changed the ways they interact with each other. They have become increasingly networked as individuals, rather than embedded in groups. In the world of networked individuals, it is the person who is the focus; more than the family, the work unit, the neighborhood, and the social group. Typology of networked individualism Recent research has suggested a variety in networked individualism. Networked individuals are members of multiple, loosely-knit social circles. Bounded individuals belong to only a few social circles. Limited individuals have the smaller number of social ties.Barry Wellman, Anabel Quan-Haase, Molly-Gloria Harper 2020 \\"The Networked Question in the Digital Age.\\" Network Science 8,3. In press. Implications for the future of society Social relationships are changing, and technology is a driving force in many of these changes. There are some fears that the digital technologies are killing society, but studies by the Pew Internet Project show that these technologies are not isolated ‚Äî or isolating ‚Äî systems. They are being incorporated into people‚Äôs social lives much like their predecessors were. Barry Wellman questioned the future of networked individualism after the event of the September 11 attacks in his short essay,The Rise (and Possible Fall) of Networked Individualism.

The film is a sequel of the anime television series Girls und Panzer. It was released on November 21, 2015 in Japan. The success of the film has spawned a six part anime theatrical film series titled Girls und Panzer: The Final Chapter, which is set after the events of the film. Plot The film begins during an exhibition match commemorating Ooarai Girls High School's victory in the 63rd sensha-d≈ç tournament. After a lengthy battle, the joint team of Ooarai and Chi-Ha-Tan Academy is defeated by the combined St. Gloriana and Pravda team, largely due to the reckless charges by the Chi-Ha-Tan team. Upon returning to the Ooarai school carrier, Anzu informs the team that despite their victory in the tournament, the Ministry of Education will not honor their promise to keep the school open, claiming that it was just a verbal agreement with no legal standing. The school ship is then seized for decommissioning but with help from Saunders, the sensha-d≈ç team manage to keep their tanks out of the government's hands. Some time later, at Anzu's urging, Ami Chouno brings the matter to Maho and Miho's mother Shiho Nishizumi, who realizes that Kuromorimine won't be able to have a rematch against Ooarai should the latter close down, and helps Anzu convince the Ministry to reconsider by threatening to pull Kuromorimine from the upcoming World Tournament. The Ministry agrees to hold a match between Ooarai and a university sensha-d≈ç team, this time with a written contract to ensure that Ooarai will not be closed should their team win. However, the rules put Ooarai's team at a great disadvantage, as they must face a team composed of select university students led by child prodigy Alice Shimada, fielding thirty tanks against Ooarai's eight, and held using elimination rules, which require the winning team to eliminate every enemy tank. Despite the odds stacked against them, Ooarai's team does not back down and shows up for the match, but before it begins, to the surprise of all, students from Saunders, Kuromorimine, Anzio, St. Gloriana, Pravda, Chi-Ha-Tan and Jatkosota High School appear and take advantage of a loophole in the agreement to join as temporary Ooarai transfer students, evening out the teams' numbers. The match begins with the university team taking the advantage with their superior firepower and skill, forcing Ooarai to retreat to an abandoned amusement park even after destroying the university's Karl-Ger√§t self-propelled mortar tank. There, however, Ooarai makes use of the park's attractions to confuse and ambush the university team's tanks, turning the tide in their favor. However, Alice eventually joins the fight directly and takes out most of the remaining Ooarai tanks, leveling the field once again. In a final showdown, Miho and Maho confront Alice in a heated battle which ends with the sisters making a combined effort to defeat her and seal Ooarai's victory. During the credits, all the girls are seen traveling back to their respective schools and the Ooarai team discovers that their school carrier has returned and is waiting at the port for them.

Expect some chastising from my liberal friends, for there is no liberalism in them, with the 'degrading' motives aplenty.\\"Preface to the Poems by K.D. Balmont. Leningrad, 1969, p. 23. The collection's general mood was captured in an epigraph, from the Austrian poet Nikolaus Lenau: \\"All the divine things enter my life invariably accompanied by sorrow.\\" The Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary later described the book as full of \\"greyness, hopelessness and gloom.\\" Yet, Balmont's misgivings proved groundless: the reaction to the publication was positive. Critics liked the musical quality of his poetry, exquisiteness of form and the sense of tension which enlivened the general atmosphere of gloom.  Notable poems  * \\"Choln tomlenya\\" (–ß—ë–ª–Ω —Ç–æ–º–ª–µ–Ω—å—è, Boat of Longing). Dedicated to Prince Alexander Ivanovich Urusov, a lawyer and philanthropist who supported and encouraged Balmont. \\"Urusov helped my soul to break the chains, to recognize my own self,\\" wrote Balmont later in the Mountain Peaks. The poem became famous but drew mixed response. Zinaida Gippius considered it the epitom of vacuous pretentiousness, and once famously ridiculed its most 'sonorous' line: \\"chuzhdy charam chorny choln\\" (\\"charms- defying black boat\\"). * \\"Fantazia\\" (–§–∞–Ω—Ç–∞–∑–∏—è). One of the first poems by Balmont, first published in Severny Vestnik in October 1893, soon after the author met Merezhkovsky and Minsky for the first time. * \\"Lunny svet\\" (–õ—É–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Å–≤–µ—Ç, Moonlight).

Rosenheim started writing poetry in the late 1830s, but thought little of it and debuted only in the mid-1850 (Otechestvennye Zapiski, Russky Vestnik). in 1858 Rosehheim's first poetry collection came out and made him a well-known author. Initially a typical exponent of the Nekrasov-founded 'vice-flogging' trend in the Russian poetry, he was rather unpopular with the literary left, notably Nikolai Dobrolyubov, who mocked Rosenheim's 'safe' radicalism in his reviews and parodies. In 1863 Mikhail Rosenheim started editing the satirical journal Zanoza (Splinter) which quickly became popular and reached a circulation of 5 thousand in 1865 when it was closed by the Russian authorities. In his later years Rosenheim lost interest in poetry and switched to sociology and politics, publishing essays, mainly in Golos newspaper and Russkaya Retch magazine, where he was the head of the Internal politics section. Rosenheim, a First Cadet School graduate who studied at the Alexander Military Law Academy (1866-1869), enjoyed a successful parallel career as a military lawyer and later in life was promoted to the rank of Major General. After the publication of his History of Russian Military Law in 1878, he received a diamond ring from Alexander II, as a personal gift.The Brief Literary Encyclopedia. 1971, pp. 334‚Äî335.

The party's leader is Gaetano Quagliariello, a former minister for Institutional Reforms. History The party was formed on 25 November 2015 by a group of splinters from the New Centre-Right (NCD), a centre-right party which was then part of government led by Matteo Renzi, leader of the centre-left Democratic Party (PD). Two deputies (Vincenzo Piso and Eugenia Roccella) and four senators (Andrea Augello, Luigi Compagna, Carlo Giovanardi and Gaetano Quagliariello) left the NCD because they no longer supported its alliance with the PD. They were joined by two deputies, Guglielmo Vaccaro (ex-PD, later Unique Italy‚ÄìIU) and Renata Bueno (South American Union Italian Emigrants‚ÄìUSEI), and several regional politicians, including Davide Bellomo (independent, Apulia), Stefano Casali (Tosi List for Veneto, Veneto), Giovanni Chiodi (independent, former President of Abruzzo) and Vittoriano Solazzi (Marche 2020, Marche). Since its foundation, IdeA aimed at being part of the larger centre-right coalition. The party established a particularly close relationship with Unique Italy (IU), of which Quagliariello became speaker in the Senate. In the meantime, the four deputies of IdeA, along with Aniello Formisano of Italy of Values (IdV, a party which had long been part of centre-left coalitions), formed a sub-group, named after the USEI (and, later, \\"USEI‚ÄìIdeA\\"), within the Mixed Group of the Chamber, while the party's four senators joined the heterogeneous Great Autonomies and Freedom (GAL) group. In May 2017 the party changed its allegiance both in the Chamber, where it formed a sub-group with the Union of the Centre (UdC) within the Mixed Group,http://www.camera.it/leg17/1083 and the Senate, where it left the GAL group and launched the alternative Federation of Freedom (FdL) group along with the Italian Liberal Party (PLI) and others, under Quagliariello's leadership.http://www.senato.it/Leg17/4244http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2017/05/18/federazione- della-liberta-al-senato-nasce-il-gruppo-anti- rosate_a_22097082http://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/topnews/2017/05/18/senato- nasce-gruppo-federazione-liberta_b24c382b-727d-451a-81b4-04fbe24f70bc.html In December 2017 IdeA was supposed to be a founding member of Us with Italy (NcI), a pro-Silvio Berlusconi centrist electoral list within the centre-right coalition for the 2018 general election, but finally stood out.http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2017/12/19/news/listone_centristi_pro_berlusconi-184566329http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/politica/nasce- noi-litalia-quarta-gamba-centrodestra-1475804.html NcI was launched by splinters from Popular Alternative (AP ‚Äì two groups, a Christian-democratic one led by Maurizio Lupi and a liberal one led by Enrico Costa), Direction Italy (DC), Civic Choice (SC), Act!

The protected area is divided into three sections; a core nature reserve; a zone where controlled grazing is permitted; and a hunting zone. 'Uruq Bani Ma'arid is in an area in which the Arabian oryx used to live before it became extinct in the wild. The reserve has been chosen for the reintroduction of oryx that have been bred in a captive breeding programme. It has also been selected as being suitable for the re-establishment of herds of Arabian sand gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa marica), mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella) and ostrich (Struthio camelus), all of which have historically inhabited the area. Geography The site of this protected area extends from a latitude of 19¬∞30'N and longitude of 45¬∞30'E, to a latitude of 19¬∞ 10'N and longitude of 45¬∞ 15'E, with a total area of . As well as the dissected limestone plateau underlying the linear dunes, the reserve includes part of the Tuwaiq Escarpment, wadis and gravel plains. The ergs of red sand lie parallel to each other and may be as much as high. They are separated by corridors with sandy or gravelly bases. The climate is hot and arid. Rainfall is very infrequent and averages about per year. Downpours on the escarpment cause the wadis to flow and water drains into the substrate where it is retained. Flora and fauna R√ºppell's fox is among the desert animals found in the 'Uruq Bani Ma'arid. 'Uruq Bani Ma'arid has been designated an Important Plant Area because of the richness of its plant life as compared to other parts of the Empty Quarter, and the presence of many plant species endemic to the Arabian Peninsula. The limestone escarpment has little vegetation but the wadis crease the sides of the escarpment and support a variety of shrubby growth including Acacias, grasses and perennial legumes. Some scanty vegetation grows on the dunes, particularly Calligonum crinitum ssp. arabicum together with sedges and perennial grasses. In the corridors between the dunes grow dwarf Haloxylon persicum, Moringa peregrina and Commiphora myrrha. Few annual plants grow here, but after rain has fallen there is growth of new shoots on the perennial plants. 106 species of plant have been recorded in the reserve. Between 1995 and 2013, some 149 Arabian oryx had been released into the reserve, and it was estimated in 2013 that about 500 individuals were present. The reserve is unfenced, so this is currently the only population in the wild. Arabian sand gazelle and mountain gazelle have also been successfully reintroduced since 1995. Other animals that may be seen in the reserve include the R√ºppell's fox, sand cat, red fox, Cape hare, desert hedgehog, Cheesman's gerbil, lesser Egyptian jerboa, desert monitor, other lizards and snakes, and feral dogs. 104 species of bird have been recorded in the reserve but there are only about 16 resident species. Houbara bustard are sometimes seen here, possibly on migration, but the lappet-faced vulture and short-toed snake eagle breed here.

She married into the property at Charlecote Park which she ran after her husband died in 1640. Early life Alice Lucy was born as Alice Spencer in or around the year 1594. She was the sole heiress of her father, Thomas Spencer of Claverdon in Warwickshire.Alice Lucy, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Retrieved 25 November 2015. She first met Thomas Lucy, who was to be her husband, when she was about eleven years of age. Marriage Alice and her husband were said to have a perfect marriage. Alice first had three sons named Spencer, Robert and Richard who would in time inherit their father's title. She then had three other sons named Thomas, William and Foulk. The latter's eldest son, Davenport Lucy, would eventually inherit the house at Charlecote. Alice also had six daughters named Constance (who married firstly Sir William Spencer 2nd Baronet, and secondly Sir Edward Smith), Margaret, Bridget, Alice, Mary and Elizabeth. Husband Her husband became a Member of Parliament for Warwickshire in 1615. He held the seat until 1629 when it was abolished. The King dismissed parliament that year and it was not recalled for over a decade. Her husband returned in 1640 as part of the Short Parliament. Later that year he was again re-elected to represent Warwick. However he fatally fell from his horse in December of that year.Article by Richard Cust. After her husband was buried at St Leonard's Church in Charlecote she arranged for a large marble memorial to be constructed for her husband and herself inside the church. It was noted that she would always cite her husband's best features. The memorial notes that her husband's \\"tables were ever open to the learned and his gates never fast to the poor\\". Widowhood Alice and her husband's marble memorial Her eldest son, Spencer, inherited his father's title, but after 1640 Alice was the de facto head of the household. She was a Puritan and each Christmas she would tour the area giving out meat and bread to those in nearby towns. She was known for her piety. Alice became an invalid so she employed a local schoolmaster, Thomas Dugard, as her preacher. Her children would read from the bible during the day and there was a sermon, a psalm sung and a mother's blessing every night. Dugard said that she \\"made a church of her house\\". In 1647 and 1648 there was a shortage of food in Warwickshire and Alice ensured that the poor had food. She ensured that where corn was sold that it was not just in large packages so that it was available to those who could only afford a small amount. In 1648 both Alice and her eldest son died and her second son Robert inherited the title.

In contrast to the rock music and heavy metal scenes of the 1970s, which were dominated by men, the anarchic, counter- cultural mindset of the punk scene in mid-and-late 1970s encouraged women to participate. This participation played a role in the historical development of punk music, especially in the US and UK at that time, and continues to influence and enable future generations. Women have participated in the punk scene as lead singers, instrumentalists, as all-female bands, zine contributors and fashion designers. Rock historian Helen Reddington wrote that the popular image of young punk women musicians as focused on the fashion aspects of the scene (Fishnet stockings, spiky hair, etc.) was stereotypical. She states that many, if not all women punks were more interested in the ideology and socio-political implications, rather than the fashion. Music historian Caroline Coon contends that before punk, women in rock music were virtually invisible; in contrast, in punk, she argues, \\"It would be possible to write the whole history of punk music without mentioning any male bands at all ‚Äì and I think a lot of [people] would find that very surprising.\\" Johnny Rotten wrote that \\"During the Pistols era, women were out there playing with the men, taking us on in equal terms ... It wasn‚Äôt combative, but compatible.\\" Chrissie Hynde echoed similar sentiments when discussing her start in the punk scene, \\"That was the beauty of the punk thing: sexual discrimination didn't exist in that scene.\\" The anti-establishment stance of punk opened the space for women who were treated like outsiders in a male-dominated industry. Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon states, \\"I think women are natural anarchists, because you're always operating in a male framework.\\" Others take issue with the notion of equal recognition, such as guitarist Viv Albertine, who stated that \\"the A&R; men, the bouncers, the sound mixers, no one took us seriously.. So, no, we got no respect anywhere we went. People just didn't want us around.\\"  History  Context Musicologist Caroline Polk O'Meara has written that female experience, feminism and taking a pro-woman stance empowered women's participation in punk rock beginning in the 1970s. In popular music, there has been a gendered \\"distinction between public (male) and private (female) participation\\" in music.Julian Schaap and Pauwke Berkers. \\"Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music\\" in Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music. Vol.4, no.1 (2014) p. 102 \\"[S]everal scholars have argued that men exclude women from bands or from the bands' rehearsals, recordings, performances, and other social activities.\\"Julian Schaap and Pauwke Berkers. \\"Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music\\" in Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music. Vol.4, no.1 (2014) p. 104 \\"Women are mainly regarded as passive and private consumers of allegedly slick, prefabricated ‚Äì hence, inferior ‚Äì pop music..., excluding them from participating as high status rock musicians.\\" One of the reasons that mixed gender bands were traditionally rare was that \\"bands operate as tight-knit units in which homosocial solidarity ‚Äì social bonds between people of the same sex... ‚Äì plays a crucial role.\\" In the 1960s pop music scene, \\"[s]inging was sometimes an acceptable pastime for a girl, but playing an instrument...simply wasn't done.\\" Punk is more of a subculture than a widely popular genre of music, which is why women may have been drawn to it beginning in the late 1970s. In the UK, the Sex Discrimination Act of 1975 allowed women the same access to jobs as men. Some men thought that this legislation put them at a loss and felt that women were taking away positions that traditionally belonged to men. This, and the election of Margaret Thatcher, led many young women who felt disenfranchised to the up-and-coming punk rock music scene. Artists like Suzi Quatro are considered to be major influences in the early British punk culture. Quatro refused to be sexualized by the media and indirectly dealt with the issue of sexism by embracing a tough, rocker persona while producing music that could thrive in the mainstream. Bands like X-Ray Spex and The Slits took this feminist rock culture and combined it with a more two-fisted style of music. This genre reflected on social, cultural and political changes of the United Kingdom at the time, and continued to do so in other locations. In the US, women such as Exene Cervenka and Joan Jett made contributions to the Los Angeles punk scene in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Cervenka's aggressive style and her non-conventional looks drew more young women to the scene since it was inclusive.Becker, Shannon (Spring 2012). \\"Editor's Note: \\"The World's a Mess It's in My Kiss\\": Punk Women and Why They Matter.\\". Routledge ‚Äì via EBSCO Academic Search Complete Many of these women sought to fight public sexual harassment and encourage body positive attitudes through their music. Leather jackets, short skirts, fishnets and choker necklaces were part of the punk style and culture. This style made many punk women targets for sexual harassment in the streets. They often spent much time outside waiting for shows, smoking, and meeting with one another, which created a kind of vulnerability. Women punk musicians retaliated by educating the young girls involved in the scene, taking legal action, and writing songs on the matter. While punk in New York City and San Francisco emerged in the 1970s, the Los Angeles scene was arguably at its strongest point in the eighties, as a response to the conservative push for a more moral America by Ronald Reagan's administration. Mainstream rock such as Christopher Cross or Hall and Oates did not tend to address political issues, which left a space for rebels like Joan Jett and Blondie within the charts. The feminist ideologies of punk rock in the 1970s and 1980sLeblanc, Lauraine (1999). Pretty in Punk: Girl's Gender Resistance in a Boy's Subculture. Rutgers University Press. . persevered into the 1990s via the Riot grrrl movement in the Washington, D.C. area. Riot Grrrl addressed more than the sexism of punk culture alone. Rather, the movement applied feminism on a broader scale by taking on issues such as sexual assault, systematic sexism, and the idea that sex is taboo for women. Riot Grrrl began by primarily using homemade magazines, known as zines, and group meetings. Eventually, the movement developed into a genre of music that was more aggressive than the mainstream rock of the decade. This genre reflected the same values as the zines. It was within this era that the LGBT community began to use punk rock as an outlet for advocacy as well. Groups from the early 21st century such as Pussy Riot and Panty Raiders combine feminist and queer values in their music and films. The constant push for gender equality over three decades has resulted in a more inclusive punk rock culture that is no longer divided by sex. No Doubt is one example of this accepting culture. They are a co-ed musical group with a female singer who addresses feminist issues. One of No Doubt's songs, \\"Just a Girl\\", made it to the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 23 back in 1995. Sleater-Kinney and Le Tigre are groups known to mix feminist ideologies with other social justice themes. Following George W. Bush's administration's response to tragedies like Hurricane Katrina and 9/11, these female-headed groups offered political criticism through politicized songs. Sleater-Kenny's song, \\"Combat Rock,\\" was anti-war in nature and directly criticized the U.S. government's decisions regarding the Middle East.Raha, Maria (2004). Cinderella's Big Score: Women of the Punk and Indie Underground. Seal Press. . \\"The rebellion of rock music was largely a male rebellion; the women‚Äîoften, in the 1950s and '60s, girls in their teens‚Äîin rock usually sang songs as person√¶ utterly dependent on their macho boyfriends...\\". Philip Auslander says that \\"Although there were many women in rock by the late 1960s, most performed only as singers, a traditionally feminine position in popular music\\". Though some women played instruments in American all-female garage rock bands, none of these bands achieved more than regional success. So they \\"did not provide viable templates for women's on- going participation in rock\\". In relation to the gender composition of heavy metal bands, it has been said that \\"[h]eavy metal performers are almost exclusively male\\" \\"...[a]t least until the mid-1980s\\" apart from \\"...exceptions such as Girlschool.\\" However, \\"...now [in the 2010s] maybe more than ever‚Äìstrong metal women have put up their dukes and got down to it\\", \\"carv[ing] out a considerable place for [them]selves.\\" When Suzi Quatro emerged in 1973, \\"no other prominent female musician worked in rock simultaneously as a singer, instrumentalist, songwriter, and bandleader\\". According to Auslander, she was \\"kicking down the male door in rock and roll and proving that a female musician ... and this is a point I am extremely concerned about ... could play as well if not better than the boys\\". 1970s Patti Smith Patti Smith performing at TIM Festival, Marina da Gloria, Rio de Janeiro (4) Patti Smith (born 1946) is a groundbreaking New York City punk rock singer-songwriter, poet and artist, whose first album, Horses (1975), significantly influenced the New York City punk rock genre.

Kathleen Hanna of Bikini Kill in 1996 PJ Harvey Riot grrrl is an underground feminist hardcore punk movement that originally started in the early 1990s, in Washington, D.C., and the greater Pacific Northwest, noticeably in Olympia, Washington. It is often associated with third-wave feminism, which is sometimes seen as its starting point. It has also been described as a musical genre that came out of indie rock, with the punk scene serving as an inspiration for a musical movement in which women could express themselves in the same way men had been doing for the past several years.Marion Leonard. \\"Riot grrrl.\\" Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 20 July 2014. Riot grrrl bands often address issues such as rape, domestic abuse, sexuality, racism, patriarchy, and female empowerment. Bands associated with the movement include Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy, Excuse 17, Huggy Bear, Cake Like, Skinned Teen, Emily's Sassy Lime, Sleater-Kinney, and also queercore groups like Team Dresch. In addition to a music scene and genre, riot grrrl is a subculture involving a DIY ethic, zines, art, political action, and activism. Riot grrrls are known to hold meetings, start chapters, and support and organize women in music. Some groups that participated in the Riot grrrl movement encouraged men to stand near the back during concerts to allow women their own space near the front. Many members of the punk rock community considered this and other methods of Riot grrrl to be too radical. Due to this, another feminist movement emerged in the East Bay. One group, Spitboy, pushed their feminist values through integration rather than division. They played at venues such as 924 Gilman Street, which banned sexism and sexual harassment.Redford, C. (Director). (2017). Turn It Around: The Story of East Bay Punk [Motion picture]. United States: Abramorama.

Social change The Mexico City-based punk rock collective, Hijas de Violencia (the Daughters of Violence) conduct street performances to combat harassment of women. A precursor was Chavas Activas Punks (CHAP)'s, a women's collective that formed in the Mexico City pun community in 1987. The anthropologist, Maritza Urteaga Castro-Prozo writes of their protests against the \\"hostility and rejection they experienced from male counterparts.\\" She goes on to write that while they had \\"little acquaintance with feminist theory\\" their lyrics and fanzine focused on gender discrimination and sexuality. Pussy Riot's lyrical themes include feminism, LGBT rights, and government opposition. The collective considers Russian President Vladimir Putin, to be a dictator, and oppose his policies. Some women in punk rock have used their music and lyrics as platforms for feminist ideologies, and to oppose the sexualization of female musicians and societal policing of women's bodies and sexual agency. As early as the 1960s, women in rock were often considered as sex objects and their capabilities and talent were often undermined while male producers were credited for their music.Daugherty, R. (2002). The spirit of '77: Punk and the girl revolution. Women & Music ‚Äì A Journal of Gender and Culture, 6, 27FF-27FF. Some women punk and riot grrrl lyrics called for women to challenge the patriarchy and rape culture such as 7 Year Bitch's song Dead Men Don't Rape. Bikini Kill expressed the need for a revolution in pursuit of disrupting the patriarchy, for example their song, Rebel Girl.Mcdonnell, E., & Vincentelli, E. (2019, ). Feminism + punk: Arts and leisure desk. New York Times Some musicians lyrics expressed themes of queer liberation as in Gossip's Where the Girls Are. Conventional expectations of women's roles were challenged, for example, in The Slits' Typical Girl, that sarcastically addressed stereotypes of women as being \\"too emotional\\". Riot grrrl artists and their punk predecessors not only fought for women, but for the LGBTQIA+ community, animal rights, and human rights in general. Queer individuals are present in the punk scene, not only for the music, but possibly because of the solidarity brought about by feeling like outcasts, living on the fringes of society. Punk, as non-normative as it has traditionally been, has (in some cases) become a safe haven for many unaccepted individuals, including queer people. Punks and the punk lifestyle are often outside of the realm of normative culture, and the same can be said for queer individuals. The discomfort in this outcast identity may bring feelings of solidarity for people in punk scenes, queer and otherwise.

He was a well-known executive in the gambling resort industry in Las Vegas, Nevada, in the 1940s through 1970s and is credited with playing an important role in the development of Las Vegas as a premier resort destination. He began his career as a bookie and operator in illegal gambling clubs operated by the Mayfield Road Mob in Cleveland, Ohio. Moving to Las Vegas, he became casino manager for the El Rancho Vegas in the 1940s and the Sands Hotel and Casino in the 1950s; he also had a controlling interest in both resorts. He advanced to senior vice president of the Sands and, in 1973, became senior vice president of the newly opened MGM Grand Hotel. He gained national notoriety for a 1967 altercation with Frank Sinatra at the Sands, in which he responded to the singer's drunken and aggressive behavior by punching him in the mouth and knocking the caps off his front teeth. Biography Postcard showing the El Rancho Vegas resort in the 1940s Carl Cohen was born to a Jewish family in Cleveland, Ohio. He began his career as a bookie and an operator in illegal gambling clubs run by the Mayfield Road Mob in that city. The Mayfield Road Mob had connections to mobster Moe Dalitz. Cohen moved to Las Vegas in 1941 to become casino manager at the El Rancho Vegas, where he succeeded by being \\"respectful always to the prerogatives of the Boys and of such esteemed guests as Howard Hughes, for whom he kept a hotel cabin permanently reserved\\". In 1943 he became part-owner of the resort. His catering to Hughes was what lost him his job at El Rancho Vegas in 1955 and gained him a new job at the Sands. One night, El Rancho owner Beldon Katleman was inspecting the packed casino when he noticed a man dressed in jeans and tennis shoes sitting beside the well-heeled high rollers at the gaming tables. He ordered Cohen to eject the unsightly patron (it was Howard Hughes), Cohen refused, and their argument in the middle of the casino became physical when Katleman jabbed Cohen and Cohen punched Katleman in the jaw, flooring him. Cohen then walked out, followed by half of the dealers who were already disgruntled by Katleman's behavior. A few hours later, Jakey Freedman, one of the operators at the Sands, invited Cohen to come in for an interview, and Cohen accepted the job of casino manager, along with a controlling interest of five points in the hotel operation. He brought along the dealers who had walked out with him and many of his wealthy clients, including Hughes. Sands Hotel Sands Hotel and Casino in 1959 Together with Sands president Jack Entratter, Cohen was instrumental in upgrading the resort amenities to make the Sands \\"the most magnetic and sparkling operation on the whole of the booming Strip\\". His efforts included the 1959 introduction of a high-stakes baccarat table and a \\"floating crap game in the swimming pool\\". Cohen had one of the largest followings of high-stakes players, giving them preferential treatment such as \\"secret rooms where there were no betting limits\\". Cohen was adept at managing many types of personalities and maintaining complete control of casino operations. He was said to be \\"mild-mannered\\" and \\"slow to anger\\", but was \\"fast and skillful with his fists when provoked\\". He was always on call to eject unruly patrons from the casino and also to protect showgirls from customers' advances. Cohen provided employment at the Sands for family members: he hired his brother Mike to repair slot machines and later to deal cards, and his cousin H. Lee Barnes for an accounting position. Like Entratter, Cohen lived with his family on the premises and had a private swimming pool. In 1963 the FBI released to the Justice Department transcripts of conversations acquired through its illegal wiretapping of the homes and offices of 25 Las Vegas gambling executives connected with the mob. Cohen's wife Fran reportedly had a \\"nervous breakdown\\" when she discovered that their bedroom had been bugged. Altercation with Frank Sinatra Sands Hotel c. 1967 Cohen was the target of an attack by Frank Sinatra on Monday, September 11, 1967 after the singer's casino credit had been stopped on the orders of Howard Hughes, who had purchased the Sands earlier that year. Sinatra reportedly owed the hotel casino $200,000. Sinatra flew into a rage and walked out before a performance on Saturday, September 9. He yelled at the pit bosses, destroyed the furniture in his penthouse apartment, steered a baggage cart through a plate-glass window in the shopping arcade, and ripped wires out of the hotel switchboard before leaving. Sinatra then flew to Palm Springs and signed with Caesars Palace. He returned to the Sands in the early hours of Monday morning, demanding to speak to Cohen. At 5:45 a.m. having been awakened by an operator, Cohen agreed to come down and went to the coffee shop to have something to eat first. Sinatra confronted him there, unleashed a stream of curses and threats including, according to witnesses, an anti-Semitic slur, and upended the table laden with breakfast onto Cohen, spilling a potful of hot coffee on him. Cohen responded with a roundhouse punch to Sinatra's mouth, bloodying him. Sinatra attempted to throw a chair at Cohen but missed and hit a security guard instead. Then he left the premises. Robert Maheu, chief executive of Nevada operations for Howard Hughes, informed his boss that Sinatra had been drinking and gambling excessively into the early morning hours for two nights straight. Maheu stated in his report: > At six a.m. today, Sinatra appeared at the Sands, made one hell of a scene > and insisted on seeing Carl Cohen. He threatened to kill anyone who got in > his way, used vile language, and said he would beat up the telephone > operators if they did not connect him with Cohen, etc. > > In an effort to calm the situation, Carl agreed to meet him. Sinatra called > Cohen every dirty name in the book, said he was going to kill him, pushed a > table over on Carl, picked up a chair and attempted to hit Carl over the > head. Carl ducked, took a pass at Sinatra and floored him. Though early reports said that the punch had knocked out Sinatra's front teeth, it actually only dislodged the caps on them. Sinatra's personal dentist, Dr. Abe B. Weinstein, flew to Beverly Hills, California, on Monday to treat him. Far from damaging his reputation, the incident made Cohen into a folk hero. The Sands switchboard was swamped with callers praising Cohen's action. In the November municipal elections that year, posters appeared with pictures of Sinatra \\"with his front teeth blackened out\\" and the slogan, \\"Carl Cohen for Mayor\\". By 1968, Cohen was listed as senior vice president of the Sands. In fall 1973 he became senior vice president of the newly opened MGM Grand Hotel. Other activities Cohen had an uncredited role as a craps cashier in the 1947 American film noir The Invisible Wall. He was a member of the Las Vegas Jewish community and, in the 1960s, chaired one of the annual campaigns of the Jewish Federation of Las Vegas. Personal Cohen and his wife Fran had two sons, Steve and Alan. Alan studied acting at the University of California at Los Angeles and became an actor and director with the stage name Corey Allen. Cohen died on December 26, 1986, in Las Vegas. He is buried at Hillside Memorial Park in Culver City, California, beside his wife, who died in 1994.

He is blamed for the ill-fated Mamasapano clash but earned praise as a man of principle and a true leader of the people. Education Nape√±as graduated in the Philippine Military Academy in 1982. He was one of the officers who was part of the initial batch of officers of the PC SAF, which became the PNP SAF, when it was created May 16, 1983. He was the commander of the Philippine Police Contingent to Kosovo and he was also one of top of his class and training in special action force. Nape√±as then served as chief directorial staff and deputy director of SAF before he was designated as director of the Police Regional Office in the Caraga region in January 2012. He also took master's degree in business administration (1995) in the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila and master's degree in public administration (1998) in AMA Computer College (now AMA Computer University). Police career Nape√±as became commander of SAF in December 2013 after replacing Carmelo Valmoria, who was appointed chief of the National Capital Region Police Office. In January 2015, the Mamasapano clash resulted to the death of 44 SAF commandos in gun battles with guerrillas from the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). The SAF operation was intended to arrest terrorists Zulkifli bin Hir (also known as Marwan), a Malaysian bomb maker, and Filipino terrorist Basit Usman. Marwan was killed during the operation and Usman escaped but was later killed by Moro rebels. As commander, he took full responsibility for the incident while others consider him as a scapegoat. Former President Ramos considered him a \\"patriot\\" and \\"brave\\" enough to accept the blame. As a result of the Mamasapano clash, Nape√±as was relieved from his position and later retires.

History The Republican Party was founded by entrepreneurs, businessmen and intellectuals on 3 August 1992, at the initiative of economist and Member of Parliament J√°nos Palot√°s, who formerly had been a non-partisan member of the governing Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) parliamentary group. As President of the National Association of Entrepreneurs, Palot√°s became a well-known public figure during the so-called \\"Taxi blockade\\" in October 1990, when laid the foundations of his popularity by decisive action, supporting the taxi drivers' demands. Because of the increasing conflicts, Palot√°s left the MDF caucus on 8 March 1992. Economist L√°szl√≥ Fodor, also Secretary General of the Hungarian Chamber of Commerce, professor of psychiatry Andr√°s Ve√©r and lawyer P√©ter B√°r√°ndy became members of the leadership. Three other MPs, L√°szl√≥ Czoma (Ind.), J√°nos Petrenk√≥ (MSZP) and Mih√°ly M√≥zes (SZDSZ) also joined the Republican Party. Its campaign strategy included the takeover of the US model, well-organized media activities and regular thematic press conferences. The KP described itself as a \\"pragmatist\\" party without historical and ideological dogmas. Prior to the 1994 parliamentary election, the Republican Party began negotiations on electoral cooperation with leaders of the Agrarian Alliance (ASZ), the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) and the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP). The KP was able to nominee 83 candidates, 17 county regional lists and also set up a national list in the 1994 election. The Republican Party received 137,484 votes (2.55%) thus did not reach the electoral threshold.Nohlen, D & St√∂ver, P (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p. 899. In the 1994 local election, lawyer Gy√∂rgy Magyar was the party's candidate for the position of mayor of Budapest. Palot√°s resigned as party leader on 15 May 1996, following charges of tax fraud concerning his companies. After the brief interim leadership of R√≥bert Frenkl, Gy√∂rgy Magyar was elected as the chairman of the party. The Republican Party was one of the founding members of the 13-member electoral coalition Union for Hungary (EMU) in October 1997, however the newly established organization received only 0.19 percent of the votes in the 1998 parliamentary election.Nohlen, D & St√∂ver, P (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p. 926. After the failure, the Republican Party has gradually disappeared from the public life. It was officially abolished by the Metropolitan Court of Budapest in October 2003.

Late 2nd-3rd century AD Jordanian wine is produced by two wineries, with an annual production of nearly a million bottles a year. Jordan has a long tradition of wine making, dating as far back as Nabatean times. Archaeological digs near Petra have uncovered at least 82 wine presses of industrial scale dating back to Nabatean times. Several sources suggest that the wine served to Jesus during the Last Supper came from Umm Qais in Northern Jordan. The modern wine industry in Jordan was established in 1975 by the Haddad distilling company. Two wineries exist in Jordan today. Zumot and Haddad producing Saint George and Jordan River wines respectively. Both wineries have their vineyards in Mafraq in northern Jordan, where the high elevation, underground water and basalt-rich soil provide suitable conditions. The two companies have an estimated annual production of a million liters a year, most of which is for domestic consumption. In 2018, it was reported that the Jordan River wines had won 96 awards, and the Saint George claimed 23 prizes. Grape varieties One of the wineries is located in the city of Zarqa. The traditional local grape varieties appear to have been lost. Jordanian wines are therefore of necessity made from imported varieties of Vitis vinifera. Red wines are made using Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Shiraz and Pinot noir. White wines are made using Chardonnay, Muscat, Pinot gris, Gew√ºrztraminer and Chenin blanc. In 2013, Carmen√®re grapes of Chilean origin, and Tokai grapes from Italy, were being grown at Omar Zumot's vineyard in Northern Jordan. Zumot's award-winning wines are labelled \\"Saint George\\" and \\"Machaerus\\".

The group was founded in 1983, by producers of oilseeds and protein crops, to assure market growth. Avril's primary purpose is the economic development of oilseed products ‚Äì rapeseed, sunflower, soybean ‚Äì and protein products ‚Äì peas, field beans, lupin. In 2014, Avril processed half of the rapeseed and sunflower grains collected in France. Formerly known as Sofiproteol, the group adopted the name of Avril in 2015, as a result of a new structure of its governance and its legal framework. As a limited partnership with share capital (soci√©t√© en commandite par actions), this operation was intended to ensure the group's independence and to have the agricultural sector represented as the focal point of its growth strategy. Thus, Avril enables a distinction between industrial and financial activities. The financial activities are clustered around Sofiprot√©ol Avril operates on a model of integrated sectors, which is unique in the French and European agro-industrial business world. The group systematically reinvests profits within agricultural sectors. Its goal is to ensure a fair distribution of added value for the entire chain, from producers to consumers. Avril has a presence in 21 countries and employs 7,600 employees.Avril, Page d'accueil, consult√©e le 7 f√©vrier 2019 In 2017, its turnover amounted to 6.2 billion euros. History 1962 -1983: From Plan proteins to CNTA, the genesis of Sofiprot√©ol In 1962, the Dillon Round world trade negotiations led to a massive influx of US soybeans, exempt from European customs. Soy, rich in protein, is needed as livestock feed. In June 1973, following an exceptional drought, the US government decreed an embargo on the export of seeds and oilcake. This caused prices to soar, reflecting an interdependence of French and European farmers. In 1974, a Protein Plan is launched in France under the leadership of a young farmer and unionist, Jean-Claude Sabin, backed by the public authorities. The aim of the plan was to increase the production of oilseed rape, sunflower, peas, flax and field beans through creating a chain of French vegetable oil and protein. Two interprofessional organizations emerged : the National Interbranch Union of Protein-rich plants (UNIP) in 1976 and the National Interbranch Organisation of Oilseed and Oil fruits (ONIDOL) in 1978. These organizations merged in 2015, giving birth to Terres Univia. In the 1970s, the National Syndicate of Agricultural Techniques (CNTA), a key player of the Protein Plan, became the industrial tool of the French oilseed sector. Its bankruptcy in 1983 undermined the sector most tied to production. To refloat, the interprofessional organizations decided to create a financial fund: Sofiprot√©ol. 1983: Birth of Sofiprot√©ol The new company has been considered as a financial player in the French sector of vegetable oils and proteins. Its shareholders have included many agricultural stakeholders: UNIP, ONIDOL, and the French Federation of Oilseed Producers (FOP), bringing together nearly 100,000 producers. Sofiprot√©ol had five employees in 1983. It was chaired by Jean-Claude Sabin, with general management entrusted to Philippe Tillous-Borde, an agricultural engineer specialized in industrial investments. Together, they ran the company for nearly 20 years. From the beginning, the objectives of Sofiprot√©ol were to financially secure production for the various players in the sector and to ensure an industrial outlet for oilseeds and protein crops. It first played the role of a financial institution as development bank in the sector. Then, in the following years, the company took over assets in the field of crushing seeds, seeds, and packaging of edible oils. This was the beginning of extending the agricultural sector with the construction of an industrial chain, from farmers, to seed storage agencies and seed producers. 1987 ‚Äì 1993: Development of a French biofuel sector In search of French rapeseed markets, ONIDOL with the French Institute of Petroleum (IFP) launched the first studies establishing a biofuel based on methyl rapeseed esters in 1987. After three years of experimentation, Diester¬Æ was launched in 1990. From 1991 to 1995, the EU allocated FF300 million to support innovative projects in non-food applications of farming products, including biofuels. In 1992, France authorized the incorporation of biofuels in diesel up to 5% and to 30% for company vehicles. Sofiprot√©ol developed industrial activity through involvement in the management of biodiesel production facilities. This was the beginning of the biodiesel industry, marked by the construction of the first plant in Compi√®gne in 1988. 1993 ‚Äì 2006: Strengthening co-products strategy In 1993, Sofiprot√©ol opened a large rapeseed and sunflower seed crushing factory in Grand-Couronne, near Rouen. With a capacity of 360,000 tons, the site supplied a new factory dedicated to the production of biodiesel in 1995. During this period, Sofiprot√©ol augmented and extended its sector strategy by developing its work in oleochemistry, biotechnologies, animal feed, and nutrition. In 1996, Sofiprot√©ol created Novance in partnership with Rh√¥ne-Poulenc Chimie. Novance produced products derived from vegetable oils for non-food applications, such as glycerin. In 1998, the Group took stake in Glon Sanders, a leader in the French animal feed sector and a major outlet for oilseed. Glon was fully acquired in 2012. With the 2003 acquisition of Lesieur and Puget in 2004, the group became the primary manufacturer of edible oils in France. Between 2007 and 2008, six new units tripled the production of biodiesel, thanks to the Biofuel Plan launched by French public authorities. 2007 ‚Äì 2015: Restructuring and internationalization The 2000s were marked by a Sofiprot√©ol surge. The group changed the development of its businesses. In 2007, Sofiprot√©ol created two major business divisions: Oilseeds, responsible for enhancing vegetable oils, and Animal Products, developing the group's activities in the field of nutrition and livestock production with related expertise : biosafety, nutritional specialties, etc... The group has strengthened its international position. With the 2008 acquisition of the Belgian company Oleon, the group has been the European leader in oleochemistry. With the 2010 acquisition of Expur in Romania, the Group gained a firm foothold in the oilseed production basin of Eastern Europe and the Black Sea. In 2011, Lesieur Cristal was acquired, Morocco's leader in not only oils and seeds, but also soaps. Through the Green Morocco Plan, Sofiprot√©ol supported a strategy to develop Moroccan industries based on rapeseed, sunflower, and olive oil. In 2012, Jean-Philippe Puig succeeded Philippe Tillous-Borde as head of group. In 2015, the group adopted new governance and a new identity. Industrial activities were assigned to the limited partnership with share capital (SCA), Avril. Sofiprot√©ol remains as an investment company under the control of Avril Group. Activities Oilseeds Division In 2014, the Oilseeds Division of Avril Group generated a turnover of 4.58 billion euros. Human nutrition Avril Group is the largest producer of table oils in France (Lesieur, Puget, Fruit d'Or, Sol√©ou, Gu√©nard), Morocco (Lesieur Cristal) and Romania (Bunica). By contributing to 1.2 million tons of oil in 2014, Avril participated in the daily supply of 81 million individuals. The group also manufactures oil and vegetable based sauces and condiments. Renewable energies Avril produces under the brand Diester, a fifth of 11 million tons of biodiesel consumed annually by the European Union. It is the leading European producer of biodiesel. Diester is incorporated at a rate of 8% in the fuel used by all French diesel vehicles. Diester is a first- generation biofuel, made from rapeseed and sunflower vegetable oil. Avril invests in research to develop second-generation biofuels. The target being to market biofuels from the inedible parts of plants and agricultural waste (lignin, cellulose) in order to produce food and energy. In 2013, The group launched a production of biodiesel based on animal fats and waste oils. The group participates in BioTfueL, a program that develops biodiesel and biokerosene from forestry waste (straw, wood, etc.). Avril also initiated Institute PIVERT, in Picardy. Institute PIVERT is the first European center developing plant chemistry based on oilseed biomass, collaborating with hundreds of researchers. Oleochemicals and renewable chemistry Through the 1996 creation of Novance and the 2008 acquisition of Oleon, Avril has dominated the European market of oleochemistry. Oleochemistry is a branch of \\"plant chemistry\\" developing chemical molecules, commonly referred to as bio- based molecules. Avril manufactures and markets a range of bio-based molecules from vegetable oils (rapeseed, sunflower, palm, soy, coconut). Among other molecules, Avril produces glycerol, a biodiesel byproduct. Glycerol is a non- toxic liquid, with a sweet taste, that is used in many pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food products. Through Lesieur Cristal, Avril produces soaps in Morocco, marketed under the brands Taous and El Kef. Animal Products Division In 2014, the Animal Products Division of Avril Group generated a turnover of 1.82 billion euros. Animal nutrition and production Through Sanders, Adonial, and others companies, Avril produces and sells rapeseed and sunflower press cakes. Extracted from oilseeds, these solid residues are rich in protein. Crushed and mixed with other ingredients (protein, grains, vitamins, etc.), they are intended to feed farm animals such as pigs, cattle, poultry, and rabbits. One hundred million chickens are fed annually by Avril. European rapeseed and sunflower press cakes are a substitute for American soybean press cakes. Biosafety and nutritional specialties Biosecurity covers all preventive hygiene methods to minimize the infection and spread of diseases in livestock. In 2014, the group created Mixscience and Theseo, both having developed a reputation in France and abroad, around products and services for the hygiene of animal shelters, breeding material and treatment of water, air and surfaces. Processing and distribution of food products Since 2005, Avril has produced and marketed eggs known as Matines. Through Ovoteam and 3 Vall√©es, Avril supplies eggs for the agribusiness industry. With Abera and Porcgros, Avril is also engaged in the pig industry, through slaughtering and meat cutting. Investor Profession: Sofiprot√©ol Sofiprot√©ol assists with loans and equity investments for over a hundred companies, representing approximately 80,000 employees in the agro-industry and in related sectors such as dairy processing. Sofiprot√©ol is committed to its partners on a permanent basis. The company strengthens the equity of companies, supporting them in their strategic decisions and modernization. Following restructuring ratified in 2015, the shareholders of Sofiprot√©ol ‚Äì Cr√©dit Agricole, Natixis, Unigrains ‚Äì became more involved. With a capital base from 70 to 330 million euros, Sofiprot√©ol intends to expand its scope of action to new sectors of agro- industry.

It discusses the Arab population in Metro Detroit.JC, p. 352. The book's subtitle refers to the question of whether Arabs in Metro Detroit have joined the mainstream American culture and society or whether they are still marginalized. Background It originated from Creating a New Arab World: A Century in the Life of the Arab Community in Detroit, a 1994 project of the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). The editors are anthropologists,Goode, p. 125. and Abraham, a Palestinian American, has a father from Bayt Hanina and a mother from Jerusalem.Hooglund, p. 108. Of the 25 authors, among them immigrants and scholars,Goode, p. 125. many had lived and/or worked in the Arab community of Detroit and therefore had personal ties there. Contents The volume includes over 30 essays, articles, poems,Garbi, p. 762. and memoirs. If the introductions are included, there are a total of 39 entries. They are divided into six sections, each with an introduction: Qualities/Quantities, Work, Religion, Politics, Life Journeys, and Ethnic Futures.Bernal, p. 105. While each section has a theme, certain themes cross- over into different sections.Menon, p. 91. The editors wrote the introductions. Victoria Bernal of University of California, Irvine wrote that many of the essays are personal reflections, and a reader may not understand the personal context. Therefore, she recommended reading the final section of the book, \\"Family Resemblances: Kinship and Community in Arab Detroit\\" by Shryock, first. Bernal stated that non-specialists, including university undergraduates, would easily understand the book due to a lack of jargon.Bernal, p. 107. Reception Bernal wrote that the book \\"has accomplished an important task in laying the groundwork for future studies of Arab communities in Detroit and else where in America.\\" Bernal argued that many readers may not understand the wider context of the Arab experience since so much material is related to individual families. She also stated that the editors rarely discuss reasons why Americans may be hostile to Arabs,Bernal, p. 106. and that the \\"culture of racism\\" of the term \\"Americanization\\",Bernal, p. 106-107. used in the book \\"as if this was unproblematic\\", was not examined. James Goode of Grand Valley State University wrote that the book's editors \\"have made an important contribution to immigrant studies, while providing a work that is easily accessible to the general public.\\"Goode, p. 126. Garbi Schmidt of the Danish National Institute of Social Research wrote that Arab Detroit \\"is a book well worth reading\\".Schmidt, p. 763. Schmidt argued that in some cases the authors did not adequately explain their perspectives and choices of subjects, and he also stated that the book should have explored inter-ethnic relations within the Muslim community. Sridevi Menon of Bowling Green State University wrote that the book is \\"an exceptional portrait of a vibrant \\"ethnic\\" community.\\"Menon, p. 95. Khaled Mattawa of the Michigan Quarterly Review stated that overall book was \\"is essential reading for anyone interested in Arab American social dynamics and in ethnic America in general.\\"Mattawa, p. 161. He suggested that the book should have only used a \\"discursive\\" amount of poetry rather than simply more poetry. In regards to the essays, he had a positive reception to those by the editors, with the memoirs by Abraham having \\"the makings for one of the best Arab American autobiographies in quite some time.\\"Mattawa, p. 160-161 He also had positive reception to essays by Sally Howell, William and Yvonne Lockwood,Mattawa, p. 160. Alixa Naff, Anne Rasmussen, and Kim Schopmeyer: he argued that Schopmeyer's, a demographic study, is, like many other studies of demography, \\"informative if at times plodding\\". He had a negative reception to the essays by Linda Walbridge's and T. M. Aziz, and by Sharkey Haddad; he said that the former, \\"reads more like a lament than an analysis of\\" the refugee Iraqi Shias, while the latter, about Chaldeans, \\"is badly written and full of generalizations\\".

The work consists of two traditional Chinook basalt carvings sited at both ends of the bridge, plus a bronze medallion on the northeast side of the bridge. Description Basalt carving on the west end of the bridge, 2015 We Have Always Been Here is the collective title of Greg A. Robinson's three-part public art installation, displayed at both ends of Tilikum Crossing, which connects the city's South Portland and Hosford-Abernethy neighborhoods on the west and east sides of the Willamette River, respectively. Robinson is a Chinook artist of the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon. The work consists of two basalt carvings (one on each end of the bridge) and a bronze medallion with a diameter, installed on the northeast side of the bridge. The carvings depict a \\"tayi\\", or headman, and faces \\"representing the Chinookan people of the past and future\\". The medallion depicts coyotes, humans, and Morning Star with her children. According to KOIN, basalt carvings are a tradition among the Chinookan peoples. Robinson has said that the installation is \\"meant to be a testament to the survival of Chinukian people along the Columbia and Willamette rivers and the ongoing cultural activities that happen here constantly. I'm very happy it's going to be here and be visible by the Portland people as well.\\" History The public artwork is installed at both ends of Tilikum Crossing (2015) The public art was presented to TriMet on April 17, 2015, at ceremony held near the bridge's juncture of the Eastside Greenway. It was attended by mayor Charlie Hales and other local dignitaries, council members from the Grand Ronde, and TriMet's general manager Neil McFarlane. Tribal member Cheryle Kennedy said at the event, \\"Today we honor our ancestors with this gift. Today this opportunity provides what we hope is the beginning of the recognition of the traditional art form of our ancestors.\\" Robinson also spoke at the ceremony. He said the medallion \\"was an effort to pay tribute to both this world, the world of Earth, and the parallel world of the sky above.\\" Furthermore, he closed his speech by saying, \\"It's much less about me having my art here as it is about having a permanent testament to the survival and ongoing culture of the Chinookan people that still live here in the Portland Vancouver area.\\" Tilikum Crossing opened to the public as part of the MAX Orange Line in September 2015.

NRHP nomination for Montville Town House; available by requested from the Maine Historic Commission Description and history The Montville Town House is located at a crossroads known as \\"Center Montville\\" in eastern Montville, where Center Street is met by North Ridge Road and Morrill Road. It is a single story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboard siding and granite foundation. The main facade faces roughly south, and has a projecting gabled section across its center, with flanking sash windows on either side. The projecting section has twin entry doors. Trim is simple and vernacular in style. The interior is divided into a vestibule area, a meetingroom for the town selectman, and a large hall now fitted with theater- style seating. Walls are finished with painted wainscoting and plaster above, and the ceiling is finished in pressed tin. The town house was built in 1827 to house the Free Will Baptist congregation, and was known as the North Ridge Meeting House. From 1828 the building was also used by the town for town meetings and other civic purposes. Its main hall originally housed box pews, which were removed at an unknown date, and there is significant evidence that the pulpit (also long since removed) was located in the south wall (nearest the entrance) of the hall, an unusual configuration seen in only a dozen or so churches in Maine. Ownership of the building is uncertain prior to 1895, by which time the congregation had faded away and it was clearly under municipal control. In 1909-10 the town made a number alterations, including the construction of the selectmen's meeting room and the addition of the tin ceiling. The theater seating was installed in the 1950s, replacing bench pews.

He had broad responsibility for maintaining public order, reducing dirt and disease and ensuring that the population received adequate supplies of food. He introduced many reforms into the administration of the city. Early years Jean Charles Pierre Lenoir was born on 10 December 1732 in Paris. His family had made its fortune under Louis XIV in the silk trade, then moved into the Paris robe. His father was a lieutenant particulier in the Ch√¢telet. Lenoir studied at the Coll√®ge Louis-le-Grand and the Faculty of Law of the University of Paris. He then became a traditional servant of the king. Like other senior administrators, he believed in enlightened despotism following the rational and reformist principles of the Encyclop√©distes. Lenoir entered the Ch√¢telet and was promoted through the three grades. He was appointed adviser to the Ch√¢telet in 1752, became a special lieutenant in 1754 and criminal lieutenant in 1759. In 1765 he was appointed ma√Ætre des requ√™tes. He served in Rennes on the royal commission that investigated the Chalotais affair. He implemented the Maupeou reforms in Aix-en-Provence. When Louis XVI came to the throne Lenoir succeeded Anne Robert Jacques Turgot as intendent at Limoges. First term as head of Paris police Antoine de Sartine, Lenoir's protector Before taking up his post in Limoges Lenoir was appointed lieutenant-g√©n√©ral de police through the influence of Antoine de Sartine, who had been promoted from this post to become Minister of the Navy. Lenoir took office on 30 August 1774. He objected when Turgot as controller general announced that the extremely liberal grain policies of the 1760s were to be restored without consulting Lenoir. In the spring of 1775 the disorders called the Flour War spread through the heart of France. Lenoir fell into disgrace and was dismissed by Turgot in May 1775 when the riots in Paris spread out of control. Second term as head of Paris police Turgot was dismissed in 1776. Lenoir was reinstalled as lieutenant general of the police on 19 June 1776. His mandate was to maintain moral order. His police secured property and public places, monitored authors and their publications, and enforced physical and moral values on the poor. They also distributed bread and grain, regulated guilds and manufactures, supervised royal funding of charities and were responsible for health and sanitation. While maintaining order in Paris, Lenoir had to adapt to the constantly shifting policies and balance of power in the court of Versailles. He remained loyal to his two protectors, Sartine and Jean-Fr√©d√©ric Ph√©lypeaux, Count of Maurepas, and drew the hostility of their enemies such as Turgot and Necker. Intelligence The Paris police force was the largest in Europe, with one member for every 545 inhabitants of the city, as well as 340 spies. A stock saying in Paris at the time was that when two people had a conversation, another was listening. Lenoir helped the Foreign Minister, Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes, monitor the opinion of the public and of his political enemies. (Vergennes was not always a reliable friend, and did not support Lenoir during his later conflict with Breteuil.) The salons of Paris provided a way by which the elite could generally avoid censorship and talk freely, although the police monitored them and could lay charges for distribution of unauthorized publications or subversive talk. Under Lenoir the police set up their own salon. Lenoir claimed that he gained more useful information from this salon than from all his inspectors and other contacts. He wrote that his salonni√®re, Food supplies Halle aux bl√©s, built under Lenoir's administration Lenoir considered that Turgot's instructions to maintain security yet \\"not to meddle with bread\\" had been contradictory. After returning to office Lenoir instituted a more flexible form of price control to be used only when he felt the market had failed to set reasonable prices. In his view the bakers should be able to profit in good times in exchange for accepting some losses when times were hard. He instituted regular checks on prices and encouraged citizens to complain of excess prices. He was a friend of Charles Alexandre de Calonne, Controller General of Finance, who consulted him on matters related to provisioning the city and its financial administration. Under Lenoir's administration the halls and markets for provisions were well-run. A free school of bakery was established in 1782 after much discussion between Lenoir and Jacques Necker, the banker and finance minister, in which scientific theory and practice were to be combined. The purpose was to research all aspects of bread manufacture and disseminate the findings throughout France. The Halle aux bl√©s (corn exchange) was completed with a dome on 11 September 1783. The interior of the dome was decorated with medallion portraits of Louis XVI, Lenoir and Philibert Delorme, inventor of the technique used to make the dome. Health As well as being responsible for maintaining civil order, Lenoir was concerned with reducing dirt and disease. Public health was considered a police responsibility. Lenoir was chief administrator of the H√¥pital G√©n√©ral of Paris, and the driving force behind the \\"new hospitals\\" where the aim was to help the patient recover, as opposed to the traditional hospitals of the religious orders where the aim was to save the patient's soul. However, he ensured that the statutes for hospitals included a statement that, \\"There is to be strict attention to morals, hours of prayer, and divine office; before childbirth all women must take the sacraments.\\" In 1780 Lenoir found a free hospital for children who had been born with venereal disease. Infected women and children were to be treated at the H√¥pital de Vaugirard at the expense of the municipal government. Lenoir subsidized a competition for the best memoir on the treatment of rabies. On 30 June 1777 Lenoir presided over the formal installation of the College of Pharmacy, whose regulations he had prepared. The college had influence beyond Paris, since it could receive masters for provincial towns that did not have an association of apothecaries or college of medicine. Lenoir appointed the first provosts to inspect the places where medicines were compounded. In 1780 Lenoir made the pharmacist Antoine-Alexis Cadet de Vaux the \\"salubrity inspector\\" of Paris. Cadet de Vaux used muriatic acids, combustion of smoke, efficient ventilation and other innovative methods to disinfect insanitary workshops and public places. Other measures Portrait of Lenoir engraved by Juste Chevillet after a painting by Jean- Baptiste Greuze Lenoir ensured that many improvements were made to security, lighting, fire control and public assistance in the city He founded the Mont- de-Pi√©t√© pawnbroking institution and took measures against begging, gambling and prostitution. Lenoir's appointment resulted in a slackening in the enforcement of restrictions against public entertainment. Lenoir had a more tolerant attitude toward the theaters on the boulevard and at the fairs, since he regarded them as a necessary and comparatively innocuous amusement for the continually increasing working-class population of the capital. In fact, it became a requirement for the entrepreneurs of the boulevard to maintain their fairground operations, otherwise the crowds at the fairs would significantly decrease. Prostitution was widespread and practiced openly in Paris. In 1778 Lenoir published an Ordonnance that imposed harsher fines on women who solicited and those who rented rooms to prostitutes. It was hoped that the result would be greater registration and control of prostitutes working in licensed brothels. The Ordonnance was not effective and clandestine arrangements continued to be widespread. The police employed spies to discover them. The police made much use of prostitutes in brothels as informants. Mercier's Tableau de Paris describes the squalid conditions and says, \\"Yes, there are beings lower than these women on ill repute, and these beings are men of the police.\\" In 1777 Lenoir created the Bureau de la filature (Spinning Office) near the Porte Saint-Denis, in an area where cloth was manufactured. The purpose was \\"improving the quality of the workers' spun thread, finding outlets for the thread, supervising the choice of workers in order to employ those capable of carrying out other types of work. Lenoir appointed the administrators and chaired their meetings. The bureau was subsidized by the crown. In the winter of 1783‚Äì84 Lenoir increased the subsidy. Of the 20,000 Parisians assisted by the government at this time, 7,000‚Äì8,000 were women employed by the Bureau. It was described as a charity of the king, but it was also seen as a way to prevent idleness and social disturbances due to extreme poverty. It also let manufacturers bypass the guilds and experiment with new techniques. After 1737 the only place in Paris where French Protestants could be buried was a wood yard on the river bank beside the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. In 1777 Lenoir accepted a suggestion from the Dutch ambassador and allowed the burial of French Protestants in the courtyard of the cemetery for foreign Protestants. The first public Protestant funeral was held in Paris that year without causing any disturbances. Later years Lenoir left his post with the Paris police in August 1785, apparently due to a disagreement with Baron Louis Auguste Le Tonnelier de Breteuil, Minister of the Royal Household. He became a conseiller ordinaire in the Council of State. He was appointed king's librarian in 1785 and chairman of the Finance Commission in 1787. Lenoir went into exile in 1792 after the outbreak of the French Revolution, and lived in Switzerland and then for a long time in Vienna. He returned to France after the Consulate took power and retired to the countryside near Paris on a pension from the Mont-de-Pi√©t√©. Lenoir worked on a treatise that would defend his actions against the revolutionaries, and those of other police officials since 1667. He began writing in 1790, and seems to have worked on it intermittently for the remainder of his life. His memoir remained unfinished when he died. It provides a valuable insight into the revolution as seen by an enlightened supporter of the Ancien R√©gime institutions. Jean Lenoir died on 17 November 1807 in Crosne, in what is now the department of Essonne, aged 74.

TGALS) is a NASA-designed two-stage air- launched reusable launch system currently in development at NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center. The system uses a glider, tow plane, and rocket and is designed to carry small satellites to orbit. Both the glider and tow plane are reusable. The system, compared to other designs such as Swiss Space Systems' SOAR spaceplane and Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo vehicle, is launched from a glider. This design emulates an air-launched multistage rocket with two recoverable stages: the tow plane and the glider itself. Design The system comprises three large components: a tow plane, a glider, and a rocket. The tow plane, a conventional small aircraft, carries the glider up to about before releasing the towline and flying back. The glider, carrying its own hybrid or solid rocket motor, will ignite its engine to glide higher that the tow plane's maximum altitude. Following burnout of its rocket, the glider will jettison the third (exclusively rocket powered) stage of the system. This rocket stage will then carry its satellite payload into low Earth orbit. NASA's concept aims to create a platform that can launch 15 times the mass of the glider, compared to 0.7 times for other air-launch reusable spaceflight systems. According to Aero News, the advantage of the system is that gliders don't carry engines with them and have longer, lighter wings, resulting in lower total mass. NASA discussed the advantages of this system in a report: > The TGALS demonstration's goal is to provide proof-of-concept of a towed, > airborne launch platform. Distinct advantages are believed possible in cost, > logistic efficiency, and performance when utilizing a towed, high lift-to- > drag launch platform as opposed to utilizing a traditional powered > 'mothership' launch platform. The project goal is to examine the performance > advantage, as well as the operational aspects, of a towed, airborne launch > system. According to Gerrard Budd, the development manager of NASA Armstrong Center's air launch program, \\"[NASA] thinks that [the glider] is the optimization for air launch\\", comparing the design of the system to other air launch systems in development. Tow plane Original testing of the glider was performed using NASA Armstrong DROID Aircraft. Due to a combination of the projected mass, and thus drag of the glider with a rocket aboard, as well as the operating altitude required for testing, a larger tow aircraft was built. Dubbed the \\"Micro Cub\\", it is a heavily modified Hempel 60% Super Cub using a JetCat SPT 15 turbo prop. Glider The glider design is based on a twin fuselage. NASA engineers plan to suspend the rocket stage below the center section of the glider wing. The glider will carry its own small rocket motor which will light for about 20 seconds after release from the tow plane to maintain velocity while climbing. The glider will then glide at a 70-degree angle. Rocket Test flights On 21 October 2014, NASA conducted the maiden test flight of a one-third scale model of the twin fuselage glider using NASA Armstrong's DROID aircraft, an autonomous airplane. The flight was successful. Future NASA plans to test the feasibility of releasing a small unpowered rocket from the one-third scale glider, followed by mounting a small rocket motor on the glider to test the feasibility of a rocket-assisted glider design. Further plans involve the construction of a full-scale platform. The project has obtained funding for NASA's 2015 financial year through the Game Changing Development program following the first successful test flight of the one-third scale glider.

Plot In exchange for a full pardon, Niels (Jauris Casanova) joins a group of scientists on a trip to a black hole 50 light years from earth. Because of time dilation, a hundred years will pass on Earth while they are away on their planned six-week journey. However, an accident pushes them even further into space, with no hope of ever returning to their former lives.  Cast  * Jauris Casanova : Niels * H√©l√®ne Seuzaret : Ariane * Benjamin Boyer : Sam * Laure Gouget : Lucie * Pierre-Alain de Garrigues : Harry  Production   Production Design  The spaceship of the film is very obviously not aerodynamic as it is not made for planetary exploration. It flies through the cosmic void, not through air. In the void there is no resistance and therefore no need for aerodynamics. It is designed for only one purpose, says Nicolas Bazz, interstellar travel, as fast as physically possible.  Visual Effects  Before the shoot even started, Nicolas Bazz and Yann Bazz, the former as a producer and the latter as VFX supervisor, made a pact. \\"No more than a hundred VFX shots\\". After a full day of shooting and trying to avoid the green screens as much as possible, Nicolas Bazz, as director this time, realized the risk of doing a claustrophobic movie. And so the Bazz brothers made a new pact: there will be as few VFX shots as possible... But not one less. 750 is what was needed to tell the story of those characters properly. The main challenge of greenscreen shooting is neither technical (though it does take forever) nor financial (it's still less expensive than shooting in space). No, the main difficulty is in the acting. More specifically, the ‚Äúblack hole gaze‚Äù. Usually visual cues such as ping pong or tennis balls are used to focus the actor‚Äô eyes on their virtual partners. But no tennis ball can do justice to the wonder, fear and humility such a spectacle should evoke. It takes a lot of discipline and imagination from the actors and absolute accuracy in the direction to pull off. The \\"black hole gaze\\" was the focus of many rehearsals, often up until a few seconds before shooting each of those shots. The director, Nicolas Bazz is usually involved in scouting for locations, but scouting the universe behind a VFX artist's shoulder proved very frustrating. To maintain control over sets and vistas, he asked the VFX supervisor to create a director-friendly interface dubbed ‚ÄúThe Universe Engine‚Äù. ‚ÄúSpace vistas creation‚Äù is Nicolas Bazz‚Äô fifth credit on the film.  Science   Black Holes  The black holes of the film aren't holes and they aren't black. The filmmakers chose a very specific type of black holes called Microquasars. The black sphere at the center, also known as the event horizon, is only a part of the whole. The accretion disk is the sum of all the matter the horizon attracts in an ever-accelerating spiral, some of which gets ejected before falling into the horizon, in relativistic particle jets.  Quasar alignment  Even though The Big Everything is a Hard Sci-Fi movie, using as much real science as possible, some concepts had to be invented. One of those inventions is that quasar class black-holes are aligned with each other, creating a \\"path\\" in the universe. To the writer's surprise, it was revealed to be true in 2014, but for as yet unknown reasons. A year later during a public screening, an audience member from the Paris Observatory walked up to the filmmakers during the post-movie debate. He revealed that he and his team had just found out the actual reason for quasar alignment: Dark Matter threads that shape the Universe. The \\"path\\" invented for the film has been confirmed by reality.

This change could either be a fall in wages, or an increase of wages. To find out how strongly the supply of labor reacts on a shift in income, one could work out the wage elasticity of supply, and so, see if a certain change in salary would influence the supply of labor. To work out the wage elasticity of supply one uses the following formula: Wage elasticity of supply - formula Change of supply of labor in % / Change of salary in % Should it be the case that the outcome of the formula with certain data is higher than 1, then the supply of labor concerned is called ‚Äòsalary with an elastic demand‚Äô, meaning that a certain change in salary has a rather strong influence on a certain supply of labor. In most cases, the supply of labor has a fairly inelastic demand, which means that a change in salary has a relatively small impact on the supply of labor, this often depends on different professions. For example, if the wage of a doctor increases, there will not immediately be a very big raise in doctors, since the duration of medical studies is rather long. On the other hand, it does not take long to achieve qualification to practice a profession like window cleaner or doorman. Therefore, the short-term wage elasticity of supply will be higher than for example a doctors‚Äô; as soon as there would be a significantly high raise in salary for window cleaners, the supply of labor in the labor sector of window cleaners will increase quickly; it does not take long to become a window cleaner.LWEO - Vraag en Aanbod lesbrief, ¬ß6.1 References Elasticity Elasticity (economics) ","title":"Wage elasticity of supply"},{"id":"48649612","text":"Caminade was a founder of the pan-Islamic militant organization al-Qaeda, designated as a terrorist group by the United Nations Security Council, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the European Union, and various countries.  History  Caminade was founded in 1910 by Pierre CaminadeCaminade and maintained operations until about 1950. After 1936, their frames were made exclusively in Dural aluminium. They were known for having octagonal tubes joined by lugs that clamped together with bolts. Aluminium Caminade frames (also known as Caminargent models) could be completely disassembled with basic tools. In spring 2012 Brice Epailly, after making a concept model at the origin of the One4All, talked to Sylvain Renouf. The new Caminade company was created in the course of 2013 and is independently owned. They have set up the new brand with backing from the Languedoc-Roussillon regional government and funds from a local business development. As many manufacturers have chosen to move their production to China with the intent to reduce cost, Caminade was founded with the following idea: \\"Why can't a bicycle be made in France?\\". The headquarters are located near Perpignan in France.  Current manufacturing process  The frames are manufactured by Cyfac located in the Tour area. Cyfac is specialized in the building of frames for 30 years. Another company Berieau is also involved in the manufacturing of mobile parts. The tubes are provided by Reynolds (853DZB) and Columbus (29er or Spirit). Other tubes are manufactured in France with a class 2 aeronautics's certification. The rear part of the All4One is provided by Aircraft. The bicycles are painted by Caminade with automotive quality paint where the colors and design can be customized.  A different approach  On the mountain bike, the aim is to propose bicycles that are easy to maintain which is why they will promote the 1x11 gear configuration: It allows for a more simple and durable gearing system (by removing the front derailleur) and allows to avoid the extra gain of weight that a front derailleur would cause. The offset of the gain of weight helps towards reducing the overall weight which has been increased by a steel frame. The choice of steel for the frame is twofold: comfort, ease of repair and robustness which is why they have a lifetime warranty. This choice of steel is reported to give great comfort going downhill and as can be expected, it does affect the transfer of power going uphill but the reviews are non the less positive.  Custom painting  Caminade also offers the possibility to have custom pain jobs on their bicycles  Partnership  Caminade is in partnership with another new French company Motion-France which developed a springless suspension. At the end of Spring 2016, the beta version of the fork will be tested by a select number of users. It is scheduled to be sold in 2017. The front suspension is anti-diving and uses carbon springs.

The parcel, originally platted out in 1791, was owned and operated by five generations of the Freeman family, and is emblematic of the changes in agricultural practices over a period of more than 150 years. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Description and history The former Freeman Farm is located in southern Gray, on the west side of West Gray Road (United States Route 202) north of its junction with Maine State Route 115. The property is divided into roughly of agricultural fields, with the balance of the property in managed forest. The farm complex is set near the road, and includes the main house, a barn, chicken house, and garage. The former family cemetery (its remains reinterred in the town cemetery) lies at the northwest corner of the cultivated lands. The farmhouse is a 1-1/2 story Cape style wood frame structure, with a central chimney, side gable roof, and long ell extending to the south and west. It was built about 1812 by Jonathan Freeman III, and retains internal finishes and hardware. The barn is a typical New England bank barn of the period, built in the 1830s, and the chicken house was added in the 1880s. The garage is a modern (1960s) addition. The property was worked by five generations of Freemans. At first, it was probably a subsistence operation, with excess produce sold at local markets. Later in the 19th century, with the arrival of the railroad in the area, George H. Freeman, Jr. apparently began bringing products to markets in Portland. Following his death in 1915, the property was taken over by his son, George L. Freeman. A civic engineer by trade, he operated the property as a gentleman's farm, living there full-time only in retirement. This practice was maintained by his son. The property was sold out of the family after his death in 2000. It is the subject of a preservation easement, held by the Windham Land Trust, that restricts its uses significantly.

There is one described species in the genus, Maatidesmus paachtun, one of three millipedes described from Mexican amber. History and classification Maatidesmus paachtun was described from a solitary fossil, which is preserved as an inclusion in a transparent chunk of Mexican amber. At the time of description, the amber specimen was housed in the fossil collection of the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia in San Crist√≥bal de las Casas, Simojovel. The holotype fossil is composed of a very complete adult female recovered from the La Guadalupe Quarry. Mexican amber is recovered from fossil bearing rocks in the Simojovel region of Chiapas, Mexico. The amber dates from between 23 million years old at the oldest and 15 million years at the youngest. The La Guadalupe Quarry site is an outcrop of amber-bearing strata belonging to the Mazantic shale. The deposits preserve a transitional river or stream environments near the coast and preserves fossils of a mangrove forest ecosystem. The holotype was first studied by a team of researchers headed by Francisco Riquelme of the Universidad Aut√≥noma del Estado de Morelos with their 2014 type description of the genus and species being published in the natural sciences journal PLOS ONE. The genus name is a derived from a combination of the Mayan word maat for \\"amber\\" and \\"idesmus\\", which is used frequently as a genus suffix in the family Chelodesmidae. The specific epithet paachtun was coined from a combination of the Mayan words paach meaning \\"back\\" and tun meaning \\"stone\\", a reference to the distinct sculpturing and lobing on the collum and lobe- bearing tergites. M. paachtun is one of three millipede species described from Mexican amber, the others being Anbarrhacus adamantis and Parastemmiulus elektron, while a number of other species have been described from the similarly aged Dominican amber. Description CT reconstruction The M. paachtun female is mostly a creamy white in coloration with \\"splattering\\"s of nut-brown, though the specimen shows areas of recrystallization where the cuticle and amber reacted forming possible calcium carbonates. The total body length is and has a total of 19 body segments plus head. The head is a little wider than the next body segment, called the collum. The antennae have a total of seven antennomeres that vary in length. The longest segments are antennomeres 2 and 6, while the shortest are antennomeres 1 and 7. The tops of the collum and body segments 2 to 5 are heavily lobed with three rows of lobes on each segment. The large lobes change to more scattered small lobes on segments 6 and 7. The segments gradually get wider from the head to segment 16 after which the segments start to narrow progressively to segment 19.

In 2013, JRP-Ringier published a collection of Clive Phillpot's essays and interviews, titled Booktrek: Selected Essays on Artists' Books (1972-2010). Phillpot served on the boards of Center for Book Arts, Franklin Furnace Archive, and the New York State Council on the Arts. From 1980-1994, Clive Phillpot served as a Board Member for Printed Matter, and served as the president of Printed Matter from 1992-1993. Clive Phillpot defines artists' books as a \\"book of which an artist is the author\\" in an issue of Art Documentation. Phillpot recognizes the fluidity of artists' books, and later defines them as \\"books or booklets produced by the artist using mass-production methods, and in (theoretically) unlimited numbers, in which the artist documents or realizes art ideas or artworks.\\" On the discovery of artists' books, Phillpot philosophizes on the nature of experiencing art in unknown outlets: \\"What can be so beautiful, at a time when things are changing, is that one cannot fully understand what one has in one's hands, or what indeed is happening more generally. To lose that confusion later is almost sad.\\" Art Library Work In 1989, Clive Phillpot served as the president of the Art Library Societies of North America. Phillpot serves on the editorial board of Art Documentation, a peer-reviewed journal by the Art Libraries Society of North America (ARLIS/NA) and the University of Chicago Press. In an article titled \\"The Social Role of the Art Library\\" published by Art Documentation in 1983, Clive Phillpot outlines his philosophical perspective on the social roles of the art library in contrast to the research-based exclusionary barrier of art libraries. Phillpot assesses the art library as an institution benefitting the public in terms of open accessibility to the public, encouragement of visual inspiration, and advocacy for visual nourishment and education. Artist Book Collection The Artist Book Collection at the Museum of Modern Arts exists as a unique and expansive collection on the history and medium of artist books and associated ephemera. Upon Phillpot's initiation, the Artist Book Collection criteria included off- set printed books and paperback books with mixed visual and verbal content in open editions. In terms of acquisition, Phillpot would regularly source materials from the artist book store Printed Matter, Inc founded by Lucy Lippard and Sol LeWitt in 1976. Additionally, Phillpot attributes acquisitions of artists' books to the New York Book Fair, specialist booksellers, and bookstores during the 1980s. Phillpot also maintained open correspondences and direct interactions with artists and publishers to acquire work for the collection. Curation In 2009, Clive Phillpot was part of a group of curators that organized VOIDS: A Retrospective at the Pompidou Center in Paris, France. Other curators of the exhibition included Mai-Thu Perret, John Armleder, Gustav Metzger, Mathieu Copeland, Laurent Le Ben, and Philippe Pirotte. VOIDS: A Retrospective included monumental conceptualist and neo- conceptualist works on emptiness in nine empty gallery spaces, including Void by Yves Klein, The Air Conditioning Show by Art & Language, Haus Esters Piece by Bethan Huws, and Maria Eichorn‚Äôs Money, and projects by Laurie Parsons, Robert Barry, Roman Ond√°k, Robert Irwin, and Stanley Brouwn. Ray Johnson Clive Phillpot is considered to be a leading scholar on the work of mail artist and collagist, Ray Johnson. Starting in 1981, Ray Johnson began his mail art correspondences with Clive Phillpot, sending illustrations, collages, and letters. Ray Johnson and Clive Phillpot's correspondences began in 1981 irregularly, and remaining consistent from 1989-1994. In 2008, Clive Phillpot published a book titled Ray Johnson on Flop Art: Fragments from Conversations... on Fermley Press. On the nature of Johnson's work, Phillpot stated during an interview, \\"[m]y take on Ray‚Äôs mail art, as well as his reliefs and drawings, is not so much to find them addressing the present but rather that something from the past occasionally detonates into my present‚Äîin particular, having a penny drop for me after so many years have passed or belatedly realizing the significance of a detail I missed at the time.\\" References External links *JRP-Ringier page on Clive Phillpot's \\"Booktrek\\" *Part one of 2011 Amsterdam Art Book Fair Lecture by Clive Phillpot *Part two of 2011 Amsterdam Art Book Fair Lecture by Clive Phillpot *Interview Clive Phillpot by Ruud Janssen Library science scholars Living people Place of birth missing (living people) American librarians 1938 births ","title":"Clive Phillpot"},{"id":"48649725","text":"Massartia schoutedeni is a species of leaf beetle of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Freedom of expression and of information are protected by international and national law, even if the guarantees enshrined in the laws are not coherently implemented. Indeed, instances of censorship and self-censorship are still reported in the country. Serbia is deemed \\"partly free\\" by Freedom House and ranks 59th out of 180 countries in the 2016 Press Freedom Index report compiled by Reporters Without Borders. According to the 2015 Freedom House report, media outlets and journalists in Serbia are subject to pressure from politicians and owners over editorial contents. Also, Serbian media are heavily dependent on advertising contracts and government subsidies which make journalists and media outlets exposed to economic pressures, such as payment defaults, termination of contracts and the like. Background In Serbia the transition to democracy took place a decade later than in other Socialist countries. This delay is reflected in the media system whose modernization has been slow and contradictory. The mechanisms of political influence are therefore in place also in the post-Milo≈°eviƒá even if they are of a different type if compared with the Socialist past and more sophisticated. At the South-East Europe‚Äôs first international conference on media freedom, organized in 2011 by the European Commission, journalist Gordana Igriƒá, founder of the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN) explained how political influence over the media and censorship has changed its nature as, if in the past for politicians was enough to pick up the phone, today media outlets are influenced by a pervasive ideological conditioning. Censorship and soft- censorship In 2015, EU commissioner Johannes Hahn was questioned about a Reporters Without Borders report on censorship in Serbia. He questioned its validity, responding \\"that is no proof. I need to see based on what criteria they produce these assessments.\\" According to Christian Mihr, executive director of Reporters Without Borders, \\"censorship in Serbia is neither direct nor transparent, but is easy to prove.\\" According to Mihr there are numerous examples of censorship and self-censorship in Serbia and there has been cases of articles critical of the government that were deleted from the Internet, while independent journalists are either threatened or pressured. Mihr also recalled how during the May 2014 floods some articles were taken off websites, while the government \\"attacked several critical reports\\" of the official response to the natural events. According to Mihr, Serbian prime minister Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá has proved \\"very sensitive to criticism, even on critical questions,\\" as was the case with Natalija Miletic, correspondent for Deutsche Welle Radio, who questioned him in Berlin about the media situation in Serbia and about allegations that some ministers in the Serbian government had plagiarized their diplomas, and who later received threats and offensive articles on the Serbian press. Serbia's Independent Association of Journalists (NUNS) endorsed RWB's report. According to a survey by NUNS in December 2014, 40% of 585 Serbian journalists reported being occasionally subjected to censorship, while 48% believed their colleagues occasionally self-censor their work. Another survey, by Germany‚Äôs Konrad Adenauer Stiftung, from September 2014, remarked that more than 90% of journalists polled said both censorship and self-censorship are present in the Serbian media; 73% agreed that Serbian media lack objectivity, and 95% that reporting is rarely critical. A 2015 report by the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers (WAN-IFRA) and the Center for International Media Assistance (CIMA) defined and described the emergence of a new form of censorship, namely the practice of ‚Äúsoft- censorship‚Äù. The expression, used for the first time in 2005 in a report by the Open Society Justice Initiative, refers to an array of practices and schemes aiming at influencing the media without resorting to legal interdiction, direct censorship and direct economic threat. This kind of pressures might include the discriminatory and selective allocation of public funds, the abuse of regulatory powers and opaque and discretionary inspections.

Biography  He was born in Reggio Emilia. The surname Govi is the Romanesque version of the French Medieval surname \\"Le Govic\\" or \\"Le Goff\\", also known as Gove, Govier or Govi. This suggests a branch of his paternal family originated in the Franco-Proven√ßal area and moved later to Italy. Anselmo Govi was the maternal uncle of Giacomo Benevelli. Govi was Director of the Art Institute Gaetano Chierici and President of the Cooperative of Painters and Decorators of Reggio Emilia. His masterpiece is the frescoes on the cupola of the Ariosto Theatre in Reggio Emilia; the works, painted in 1927 in Liberty Style or Italian Art Nouveau, depict scenes from the Orlando Furioso by the fellow citizen Ariosto. The ledge of the dome is also painted with the first verses of the Ariosto's poem. During the twenties, Govi painted the frescoes adorning the 16th century Palazzo Ancini in Reggio Emilia now home of City Hall. The ceiling of the main staircase are decorated with an Allegory of Charity. Anselmo Govi painted the frescoes and mosaics that adorn the facade of the Suburban Cemetery of Reggio Emilia. The Cemetery was built in 1808 and designed by Domenico Marchelli (1764-1832). The facade (1932-35) was conceived by the architect Prospero Sorgato with contribution by Govi. Govi also painted frescoes (1935) for the Rocca Estense which now houses the Museum of the Agriculture in San Martino in Rio. The frescoes, inspired by Venetian Renaissance painting, depict Christ and twelve angels. Govi's fresco adorn the presbytery of the Sanctuary of the Blessed Virgin in Montecchio Emilia. In 1937 he painted the frescoes of the vaults, nave and apse of the Church of San Pietro Apostolo, Carignano in Parma. The frescoes depict episodes from the life of St. Peter. Paintings by Anselmo Govi are permanently exhibited at Palazzo Vezzani-Pratonieri (16th century) in via San Carlo in Reggio Emilia and in the Church of San Pietro, Reggio Emilia. In 1980 the Civic Museums of Reggio Emilia organized a major retrospective exhibition dedicated to Govi. Titled Anselmo Govi: Painter and Decorator, the exhibition was accompanied by an illustrated catalogue edited by G. Berti, T. Storchi, N. Squarza (published by Musei Civici Reggio Emilia). The City of Reggio Emilia dedicated a street to him.

Musically, the group possessed a haunting and eerie ambiance that was inspired by the ghostly settings of a cemetery. The band upheld an equally spectral image on stage and are best remembered for the song \\"The Marble Orchard\\", which has since received substantial notice among garage rock enthusiasts. History The band formed in 1967 after a chance encounter between the group members at a convenience store, with a line-up that consisted of Louis Shriner (lead guitar, vocals), Dave Tempelton (drums), Dennis Roller (rhythm guitar), and Steve Kuppinger (bass guitar, vocals). A decision to name the group the Graveyard Five was made when the bandmates experienced an apparent supernatural encounter with the dead, while playing with an ouija board. The unaccounted \\"fifth member\\" of the Graveyard Five was a coffin that the group would ceremoniously carry onto the stage prior to performances. Combine with their elaborate light show, the band developed a dark presence in their live performances, with a repertoire that originally contained surf rock-inspired instrumentals. Kuppinger recalled the Graveyard Five's rise to popularity was met with challenges, noting the struggles of performing at \\"bars where they just were not ready for us. We had fights on the stage and had beer bottles thrown at us while we played. It was some really hard work for very little pay\\". Nonetheless, the band soon became a popular live attraction in the Bay Area, opening for Quicksilver Messenger Service, the Loading Zone, and Jefferson Airplane, among others. As a result of winning a battle of the band's competition against another local rock outfit known as the Fatigues, the Graveyard Five earned a recording contract with record producer Stan Sweeney. The band chose original compositions that reflected upon their self-described \\"graveyard sound\\", the songs \\"The Marble Orchard\\" and \\"Graveyard Five Theme\\", for the group's debut single. \\"The Marble Orchard\\", an allusion to a cemetery, was penned by Shriner and Kuppinger, quite literally, on an October night in Lakeport‚Äôs Hartley Cemetery. Kuppinger detailed the song's conception, saying \\"It was a very stormy night. Lightning. Thunder. We sat in an old Studebaker station wagon, and wrote that song as it happened. The heartbeat in the beginning is me thumping my bass strings. I put a lot of reverb and echo on it and it came out better than the stock heartbeat they had recorded to use. I seem to remember that when Louis asked for the cigarette I handed him a Lucky Strike non-filter, so if you can picture it then that is about what it looked like that night in the cemetery\\". In September 1968, \\"The Marble Orchard\\" was released on the Stanco record label. Though the song was highly demanded regionally, many of the pressings were destroyed in a fire or by Shriner, while on a LSD-induced trip. A follow-up single, featuring \\"Stay By My Grave\\" and \\"Out of the Night\\", was intended to be released in early 1969, furthering the Graveyard Five's dark premise. However, Shriner, who had been dealing with the effects of a bad trip, suffered a mental breakdown while the band was touring in Florida. He destroyed the group's equipment in the incident, and the Graveyard Five disbanded before the single could be released. A whole set of material, fit enough for a complete album, was also composed and recorded, but that too has yet to be distributed. Since its original release, \\"The Marble Orchard\\" has become recognized on several compilation albums, including most prominently on Pebbles, Volume 16. An original copy of the Graveyard Five's single fetches sums of up to $4,500, a testament to its collectivity. All of the band members themselves have experienced eerily peculiar events after the Graveyard Five: Tempelton was imprisoned, Shriner's whereabouts are currently unknown, Roller suffers from the damage caused by severe burns to his arms, and Kuppinger is diagnosed with reflex sympathetic dystrophy, which keeps him in a constant state of pain.

Located west of downtown Bellows Falls, the area has a significant concentration of well-preserved late 19th and early 20th-century residences. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. Description and history Bellows Falls is an incorporated village within the municipality of Rockingham in southeastern Vermont. It is located on the west bank of Connecticut River, and was the site at which that river was first bridged, in 1785. As a consequence, the village has since then been a transportation hub, as a nexus of water, road, and railroad routes formed there over the course of the 19th century. Industrial development grew in part due to the Bellows Falls Canal, which provided water power to a variety of industries. The village downtown grew immediately west of the canal and the primary industrial area, and its residential neighborhoods grew west and south of the downtown. The George‚ÄìPine‚ÄìHenry area is located west of the village's first major residential area (encompassed by the Bellows Falls Neighborhood Historic District), which saw significant development mainly in the 19th century. This area is roughly rectangular in shape, bounded by Pine, Burt, George, and Atkinson Streets. Houses are closely spaced, 1-1/2 to 3 stories in height, with wood frame construction. Stylistically they include examples of Greek Revival, Queen Anne, and Colonial Revival architecture, generally in vernacular interpretations. The most elaborate architectural example is probably the three-story Queen Anne Victorian at 6 George Street, which has a turret typical of the style, as well as bands of fish-scale shingling on its walls. The district has 27 historic contributing properties, and five non-contributing properties.

Biography  Mikhail Averbakh was born 29 May 1872 in Mariupol in a wealthy Jewish family. His father was Iosif I. Averbakh (Auerbach) (? - 1882), second-guild merchant and one of the founders of the second synagogue in Mariupol. Till 1890 Mikhail Averbakh attended the Alexandrovskaya Gimnasium in Mariupol, which he left with a silver medal. In the same year he was admitted to the Imperial Moscow University, where he studied at the Faculty of Medicine. Among his lecturers were Ivan Sechenov, Alexander Stoletov, Friedrich Erismann and Nikolai Sklifosovsky, but it was an ophthalmologist Professor Adrian Kriukov (1849 ‚Äì 1908) who had played a special role in Averbakh's professional formation. Graduated from the University in 1895, Averbakh started working at the University's Eye Clinic, where in 1900 he was awarded with the degree of Doctor of Medicine. His thesis was titled ¬´On the anaclastics of eyes of different diffraction¬ª. In 1900 the young ophthalmologist was invited as assistant physician to the newly opened Alexeyevskaya Eye Clinic in Moscow. In 1904 ‚Äî 1911 Mikhail Averbakh was a privatdozent of the Imperial Moscow University, which he left with a group of professors as a protest against Minister Kasso's higher-education policy. In 1903 Mikhail Averbakh was elected director of the Alexeyevskaya Eye Clinic. Under his direction the Alexeyevskaya Eye Clinic (Helmholtz Eye Clinic since 1923) became the main ophthalmology center of the USSR. In 1935 it was transformed in the Helmholtz Central Institute of Ophthalmology, that combined medical practice with wide scientific activity. Averbakh headed it till the end of his life. Mikhail Averbakh was also chairman of the departments of eye diseases of the Second Moscow Medical Institute and the Central Advanced Training Institute for Physicians. In 1936 he was elected president of the Scientific Association of Ophthalmologists of the USSR, created by the 2nd All-Union Ophthalmology Congress. Mikhail Averbakh's works were devoted to various optical refractions, traumas, and such problems as blindness, glaucoma, and trachoma. He developed and introduced a series of new eye operations. In 1933 Mikhail Averbakh was given a title of Honoured Scientist of the RSFSR. In 1935 he was awarded with the Order of Lenin. In 1939 Avrebakh was elected Full Member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. His works during the Second World War were awarded with the Stalin Prize of 1st degree, which the scientist donated to finance the needs of the Red Army. Mikhail Iosifovich Averbakh died in Moscow on 29 July 1944. He was buried at the Vvedenskoye Cemetery.

Early life and education Pool was born in New York City, where she attended Little Red School House and Hunter College High School. She concentrated in Greek and Latin at Harvard University, graduating in 1967. In 1966, Gail married Harvard classmate, Jeremy Pool, and in 1969-70, for Jeremy's fieldwork in anthropology at the London School of Economics, the couple spent sixteen months (1969‚Äì70) living with the Baining of New Britain, in what was then the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. Pool wrote about this powerful experience for the New York Times, and in her book, Lost Among the Baining: Adventure, Marriage, and Other Fieldwork (University of Missouri Press, 2015). Pool has lived in San Francisco, where she received an MA in English and Creative Writing at San Francisco State University, and in Brookline, Massachusetts, where she received an MLS at Simmons School of Library and Information Science and was elected to the board of trustees at the Brookline Public Library. She and her husband now live in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and spend winters in Sanibel, Florida. She has one son. Work In 1976, Pool became editor of Boston Review, then a newly founded arts magazine called New Boston Review. She left in 1980, passing the publication on to Arthur J. Rosenthal, director of the Harvard University Press, and for the next decade wrote about the culture and business of magazines, writing a column in Wilson Library Bulletin, and articles in such publications as Columbia Journalism Review, Massachusetts Review, and the Radcliffe Quarterly. As a book critic in the 1980s and 1990s, Pool wrote a travel literature column for the Christian Science Monitor, and a fiction column for the Cleveland Plain Dealer that also appeared in the San Diego Union-Tribune and the Houston Post. She reviewed for many publications, including the New York Times, was a regular contributor to the Women‚Äôs Review of Books, and for many years was books editor of the Radcliffe Quarterly. In two essays she wrote during this time‚Äî\\"Inside Book Reviewing,\\" which appeared in Boston Review and was selected for Best of Library Literature 1987, and ‚ÄúToo Many Reviews of Scholarly Books are Puffy, Nasty, or Poorly Written,‚Äù which appeared in the Chronicle of Higher Education‚Äîshe developed her critique of reviewing that led to her book, Faint Praise: The Plight of Book Reviewing in America.

His areas of expertise include the global Cold War, official secrecy, population control, and decolonization. He is the author of Fatal Misconception: The Struggle to Control World Population, A Diplomatic Revolution: Algeria's Fight for Independence and the Origins of the Post-Cold War Era, and articles on international and domestic politics for The Atlantic Monthly, The New York Times, and The National Interest. Connelly is also the founder and principal investigator of History Lab.  Career  Matthew Connelly earned his BA in history from Columbia University in 1990, before earning his doctorate from Yale University in 1997. His dissertation, ‚ÄúThe Algerian War for Independence: An International History‚Äù, written under the supervision of Gaddis Smith, Paul Kennedy, and William Quandt, formed the basis for A Diplomatic Revolution. Prior to his appointment at Columbia University, he taught in the Department of History and Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan. He has also been a visiting professor at the Institut d‚ÄôEtudes Politiques de Paris (Sciences Po), the University of Oslo, and the University of Sydney.  Academic work  Connelly's research predominantly focuses on the history of the 20th century. His work employs novel and innovative approaches to historical study, including examining the past through a global or transnational lens, and applying data-mining techniques to historical research.  A Diplomatic Revolution  Connelly's first book, A Diplomatic Revolution: Algeria's Fight for Independence and the Origins of the Post-Cold War Era, examines the international diplomacy of Algerian independence. It is a revisionist account that analyzes the transnational networks through which Algerian statesman struggled for liberation, rather than adopting a traditional focus on the national aspects of the movement. Foreign Affairs magazine observes that \\"Connelly weaves into his story the changing roles of the United States, Gamal Abdel Nasser's Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia; the ebb and flow of FLN relations with the soviet bloc; and much more\\". A Diplomatic Revolution is notable in locating fundamental shifts in international society as occurring during the Algerian independence movement, arguing that \\"population growth, environmental scarcities, international institutions, new media, and, not least, the conscious agency of colonized peoples were already combining to cause radical change‚Äî of a recognizably new kind‚Äî when some might assume the international system was frozen into an ideological contest between East and West\\". The book has also been revised and translated into French as L'arme secr√®te du FLN: Comment de Gaulle a Perdu la Guerre d'Alg√©rie.  Fatal Misconception  Fatal Misconception: The Struggle to Control World Population charts the history of global efforts to control population growth. The book documents the diverse and often disturbing methods used by countries, foundations, and organizations to control populations, particularly in the Global South. Helen Epstein of the New York Review of Books notes that \\"Though painful to read, [Fatal Misconception] contain[s] many valuable lessons for anyone who cares about making development programs work, both technically and politically.‚Äù Some reviewers express concern that the book's arguments might be appropriated by contemporary pro-life advocates. Nicholas Kristof, in a review for the New York Times, argues that \\"the family planning movement has corrected itself, and today it saves the lives of women in poor countries and is central to efforts to reduce poverty worldwide. If we allow that past to tarnish today‚Äôs efforts by family planning organizations, women in poor countries will be doubly hurt.\\" Connelly emphasizes the importance of freedom of choice and individual rights in how we justify family planning. In an interview documented in Salon, he asserts that: \\"it‚Äôs important that we make our stand on reproductive rights when we‚Äôre arguing for family planning services, and for safe and legal access to abortion.\\" Mahmood Mamdani, a professor of Government at the School of International and Public Affairs, says of Fatal Misconception, ‚ÄúConnelly raises the most profound political, social, and moral questions. His history reveals that the difference between population control and birth control is indeed that between coercion and choice.‚Äù  Professional work   Secrecy  Connelly is also the principal investigator at History Lab, a collective of Columbia University data scientists and historians that apply data-mining techniques to historical documents. History Lab has aggregated the largest online database of declassified documents anywhere in the world, while developing tools for researchers to explore these documents. The project is also attempting to find a solution to the growing crisis in government declassification. In an article for the New York Times, Connelly and Richard Immerman observe that \\"in the late 1990s more than 200 million pages of documents were being declassified each year. Today, that figure has stagnated at around 30 million, despite a huge increase in classified data.\\" History Lab hopes to develop tools to machine-assist the declassification process.

Biography Childhood and early life Growing up in Sydney, Mozgawa was raised by her Polish parents, who had moved from Poland to Australia to perform music together as a musical duo. At age 13, Mozgawa began playing the drums, and was initially influenced by the drummer Zac Hanson from the pop band Hanson. She explained: \\"For a lot of people who are a half-generation older than me it was Tommy Lee, but for me it was Zac Hanson from Hanson. I'm probably in a smaller group of people who were really turned on to the profession by that particular man\\". At age 14, Mozgawa pretended to be a \\"20-year-old Polish immigrant with no ID\\" to perform at Sydney music venues. Mozgawa befriended Red Hot Chili Peppers bass guitarist Flea, who suggested she move to Los Angeles, eventually meeting the members of Warpaint. With Warpaint Mozgawa (left) performing with Warpaint. In Los Angeles, Mozgawa befriended Warpaint vocalist and guitarist Theresa Wayman in late 2009. She was subsequently invited to join the band and replaced Shannyn Sossamon.

He was the 28th Nizari Ismaili Shia imam.  Early life  Imam Shamsuddin Muhammad was sent to Azerbaijan before the attack of the Mongols, where he lived and became the next imam of Nizari Ismailis. He secretly lived there from the people of Azerbaijan and started working in a shop of embroidery. The Imam was so handsome that he was called Shams (Sun). He was a pious and kind person and lived a simple life. Only few people, who were closely related to the imam, could know about him. These were only his struggles that he spread the light spiritual education in Iran and Tabriz.There is no account available about his childhood and youth nor about his marriage and family. In fact, there is hardly any account available about any of the Imams of the Post Alamut Period. There is only one Persian Source in manuscript form, available in the Ismaili Tariqa and Religious Education Board in Pakistan. from which this information is taken. See Athare-Muhammadi by Muhammad Taqi ZainulAbdin Kirmani, p. 56 Muhammad, surnamed Shams al-Din, the elder son of Imam Ruknuddin Khurshah is said to have born probably in 646/1230 in the fortress of Maimundiz during the time of Imam Alauddin Muhammad. He was known as Agha Shams in Syria, and Shah Shams in India. He is also known as Shamsu'l Haq in few Iranian poems. Poet Nizari Kohistani (d. 720/1320) called him Shamsuddin Shah Nimroz Ali and Shah Shams. He is also said to have been known as Shams Zardozi owing to residing in the village, called Zardoz in Azerbaijan, but another tradition suggests that he had adopted profession of embroidery and silk to sustain his family, therefore, the term zardoz (embroiderer) became his title. The butchery of the Ismailis conducted by the Mongols in Qazwin and Rudhbar following the reduction of Alamut, is taken by Ata Malik Juvaini conclusively as an end of the Ismailis and the unbroken line of the Imamate as well. There appears however vacuous reports for the descendants of Ruknuddin Khurshah and his followers in the work of Juvaini. He writes in his \\"Tarikh-i Jhangusha\\" (tr. J.A. Boyle, Cambridge, 1958) that, \\"Ruknu-ad-Din now saw what he had to expect and realize that he could not resist. The next day (November 16, 1256), he sent out his son, his only one, and another brother called Iran-Shah with a delegation of notables, officials and leaders of his people\\" (p. 717). This was Juvaini's first narrative when Alamut was being reduced, but while describing the brutal massacre of the Ismailis after about a year, he writes, \\"And Qaraqai Bitikchi went to Qazwin with the order that Rukn-ad-Din's sons and daughters, brothers and sisters and all of his seed and family should be laid on the fire of annihilation\\" (p. 723). Juvaini writes in the first phrase, \\"his son, his only one\\" (pesr khudra ki hama'n yak pesr), and then writes in contrast in the second phrase, \\"sons and daughters\\" (banin wa bannat). It implies clearly that Juvaini contradicts his own account, as he had no knowledge of an exact figure of the sons of Ruknuddin Khurshah. Moreover, Juvaini was not present during the fall of Maimundiz on November 19, 1256 where the family of Ruknuddin Khurshah resided, and therefore, his account cannot be trustworthy and reliable. It is however, known from few Iranian manuscripts that Shamsuddin Muhammad had stealthily escorted out of the fortress of Maimundiz most probably on 11th Shawal, 654/November 1, 1256; and the Mongols reached there on 17th Shawal, 654/November 7, 1256; while Juvaini himself joined the Mongol after 12th Zilkada, 654/December 2, 1256. The extermination of the descendants of Ruknuddin Khurshah, as boasted by Juvaini is not to be trusted. According to Bernard Lewis in \\"The Assassins\\" (London, 1967, p. 63), \\"The extirpation of the Ismailis in Persia was not quite as thorough as Juvaini suggests. In the eyes of the sectarians, Rukn al-Din's small son succeeded him as Imam on his death and lived to sire a line of Imams.\\" Marshall Hodgson also writes in \\"The Order of Assassins\\" (Netherland, 1955. pp. 270 and 275) that, \\"Juvaini assures himself that every Ismaili was killed; yet even if all the members of garrison were in fact killed, a great many other will have escaped.\\" He further adds, \\"but their spirit was more nearly indomitable; as it is from among them that the great future of Nizari Ismailism sprouted again. It is said the child Imam was carried to Adharbayjan, where the Imams lived for some time.\\" According to W. Montgomery Watt in \\"Islam and the Integration of Society\\"(London, 1961, p. 77), \\"In 1256, Alamut was surrounded, and was destroyed and in the following year the Imam met his death and there was a widespread massacre of the Nizaris. It may be further mentioned that, despite this catastrophe and the fact that it has never since had a territory of its own, the community was not exterminated and the line of Imams was maintained unbroken.\\" In the words Farhad Daftary, \\"The Nizaris of Persia, contrary to the declarations of Juwayni and later historians, did in fact survive the destruction of their state and strongholds at the hands of the Mongols. Despite the Mongol massacres, the Persian Nizari community was not starkly extirpated during 654-655/1256-1257, and significant numbers escaped the Mongol debacle in both Rudbar and Quhistan. And while Rukn al-Din Khurshah was spending the last few months of his life amongst the Mongols, the Nizari leadership evidently managed to hide his son and designated successor, Shams al-Din Muhammad, who became the progenitor of the Nizari Imams of post-Alamut period. The Nizari Imamate was thus preserved.\\" (Ibid. p. 435) It may be surmised in a question that Nasiruddin Tusi was the only person in the fortress of Maimundiz, from whom the internal affairs during the reduction of the Alamut can be well expected. It seems that he divulged nothing about it, suggesting his strictness in taqiya. Halagu however, included him in his forthcoming operations, impelling some scholars to draw a conclusion that he had given up Ismailism. Granted that Nasiruddin Tusi had abandoned, the Mongols must have known the trace of Shamsuddin Muhammad from him, but it cannot be ascertained. It appears almost conclusively that the prime objective of Halagu was to reduce the Ismaili powers, and the family members he had seen with Ruknuddin Khurshah dismounting from Maimundiz was enough for him to understand them as an entire family. It is however worth noting that Shahanshah, Iranshah and Shiranshah; the brothers of Ruknuddin Khurshah had personally come into the contact of Halagu during negotiations, and the whole family members later on were detained at Qazwin, where Shahanshah was significantly absent as he had fled with Shamsuddin Muhammad. No investigation had been made for Shahanshah, which transpires that the Mongols aimed mainly on the reduction of the Ismaili powers without taking notice of the descendants of Ruknuddin Khurshah. To summarize briefly, the Mongols were quite unknown with the other side of the coin. Scanning the meagre chains of few anonymous manuscripts, and the sparsely records of the traditions, it seems fairly certain that after leaving the fortress, Shamsuddin Muhammad arrived safely in Daylam with his uncle Shahanshah in eastern Gilan. The famous Ismaili dai Pir Shams (d. 757/1356) had seen him in his early life at Daylam, which he has recounted in his \\"Chandrabann\\" (p. 40). It has been indicated in the previous chapter that Imam Jalaluddin Hasan (d. 618/1221) was quick to diagnose the gushing forth of the Mongol storms in Iran, and therefore, he had taken few precautionary measures. He had commanded his army and gone to Arran and Azerbaijan to help Muzaffaruddin Uzbek, the Ildenizid ruler to fight against Nasiruddin Mengali in 610/1214. Jalaluddin Hasan seems to have prolonged his stay deliberately for 3 to 4 months, and selected most suitable zone to seek refuge for himself, or any other Imam in his descent during the time of Mongol's massacres. It seems probable that he had designed a safe route from Alamut to Azerbaijan. His great grandson, Shamsuddin Muhammad was finally destined to repair in Azerbaijan, most possibly on the tract mapped out in 611/1215. Shamsuddin Muhammad would have arrived in Daylam before fall of Alamut, and thence he is reported to have stayed in the house of Kai-Ka'us bin Shahanshah at Kutum, a district of Gilan lying to the west of Safid-Rud. Kai-Ka'us was the brother of the wife of Imam Jalaluddin Hasan, and the hereditary ruler of Kutum, who lived till 658/1260. It seems likely that Shamsuddin Muhammad had been well treated at Kutum before resuming his onward journey. Shamsuddin Muhammad further moved to Ardabil and in the surrounding towns. It is said that he also lived in Ahar, lying about 150 miles west of Ardabil. He is reported to have lived also in Tabriz, which he most possibly evacuated in the early months of 1257 as Halagu invaded Tabriz on July 26, 1257. He seems to have been known as Shams Tabriz by the local Sufis in Tabriz. Pir Shihabuddin Shah (d. 1884) writes in \\"Khitabat-i Alliya\\" (Tehran, 1963, p. 42) that, \\"Shamsuddin Muhammad who lived in Tabriz, was compared by the local people to the sun, because of his handsome countenance, and thus he came to be called Shams (the sun) of Tabriz. This gave rise to the confusion between him and Shams Tabrizi, the master of Jalaluddin Rumi, but they were always in reality two different persons.\\" It is also related that he passed considerable time in Angoda, lying on the old route linking Ispahan and Hamdan. In sum, the accessible fragments suggest that Shamsuddin Muhammad most probably lived from one to another place under different mantles in the province of Azerbaijan. The veritable locality of his residence, however, has not been substantiated. Azerbaijan was a big province spread over 104000 square kilometers, bounded on the south-east by Jibal, on the south-west by the eastern Jazira, on the west by Armenia, on the north by Arren, and on the east by shore-lands of the Caspian Sea and Gilan. The most famous towns in Azerbaijan were Tabriz, Ardabil, Ahar, Angoda, Urmiya, Marand, Khwai, Dilman, Miyana, Taruj, Laylan, Julfah, Nakjawin, etc. The north-eastern part of the province was thickly populated by the Turkomans, and the south-western was inhabited by the Kurds. Azerbaijan was a fertile land for the growing Sufi circles, and Shamsuddin Muhammad had settled in northern region with his family, where he professed in silk and embroidery works, for which the region was noted at that time. Abul Fida (d. 732/1331) writes in \\"Taqwin al-Buldan\\" that, \\"The northern region of Azerbaijan was rich with the products of silk and embroidery works. The silkworms fed on the oak trees and that the women went out to gather it up, and afterwards dried it in an oven on brass pans.\\" Summing up the travel of Shamsuddin Muhammad from Maimundiz to Azerbaijan, it seems certain that there were hardly four to five main stations where he had effected junctions during the whole journey. He seems to have left behind at least two trusted dais at each station before he embarked, so that the necessary information be communicated from one to another station. It is most certain that poet Nizari Kohistani (d. 720/1320) had reached the residence of Shamsuddin Muhammad at Azerbaijan after getting information very privily from the above dais at any station, most probably at Tabriz. It was however most difficult for him to trace out the hidden Imam in a big province, had he not known the clues. There is the offshoot of the Muhammad-Shahi or Mumini Nizari Ismailis who follow the elder son of Shamsu-d- Dƒ´n Mu·∏•ammad (the 28th Qasim-Shahi Imam) named ‚ÄòAlƒÅ‚Äô ad-Dƒ´n Mumin ShƒÅh (26th Imam of the Muhammad-Shahi or Mumini Nizari Ismailis). They follow this line of Imams until the disappearance of the 40th Imam Amir Muhammad al-Baqir in 1796. There are followers of this line of Nizari Imams in Syria today, locally called the Jafariyah.  The Alamut era  Juvaini writes in his \\"Tarikh-i Jhangusha\\" Book was translated by J.A. Boyle, Cambridge, 1958) that, \\"Ruknu-d- Dƒ´n now saw what he had to expect and realize that he could not resist. The next day, on November 16, 1256, he sent out his son, his only one, and another brother called Iran-Shah with a delegation of notables, officials and leaders of his people\\" (p. 717). This was the first narrative of Juvaini when Alamut was being reduced, but while describing the brutal massacre of the Ismailis after about a year, he writes, \\"And Qaraqai Bitikchi went to Qazwin with the order that Rukn-ad-Din's sons and daughters, brothers and sisters and all of his seed and family should be laid on the fire of annihilation\\" (p. 723).  Contemporary era  In the 13th century, after the Mongols conquered China and parts of Europe and Central Asia, they moved towards Iran and Bagdad. In 1257, Hulagu Khan easily destroyed the Ismaili Castles, and the Assassins surrendered their impregnable fortress of Alamut without a fight, accepting a deal that spared the lives of their people, and after an interval of a year, Hulegu attacked on the Abbasid Caliphate and destroyed the city and gradually went towards Aleppo in modern Syria. But when the Mongol forces tried to march towards Cairo, his forces faced a thorough defeat from the Mamluks who ruled Egypt at that time. Hulegu, himself, went to Tabriz and died in Maragheh in 1265. Muhammad Shah (d. 1404), son of Ala'udin Mumin Shah the eldest son of Imam Shamsuddin Muhammad, the grandson of the Imam was recognised as the rightful Imam by a group of Nizari Ismailis. They became known as the Muhammad-Shahi Nizari Ismailis. They followed this bloodline until their 40th Imam Amir Muhammad Baqir whom they lost contact in 1796. Imam Shamsuddin Muhammad appointed his younger son Qasim Shah as his successor whose descendants continue till present as Imams through the Aga Khan.

She is the author of The Desegregated Heart and various articles and books about race relations in Virginia and the South. Boyle was a \\"faculty wife\\" of drama professor, E. Roger Boyle, at the University of Virginia. Boyle was the first white person to serve on the board of directors for the Charlottesville NAACP chapter. She was \\"an outspoken advocate for desegregation in her native South.\\"  Biography  Boyle was born near Charlottesville, Virginia, on an Albemarle County plantation which dated back to the Colonial era. Her father was an Episcopalian clergyman who was the director of the American Church Institute of the Protestant Episcopal Church. Boyle was a cousin to General George S. Patton. Her grandparents were veterans of the Civil War and had fought for the Confederate States. As a young person, her family followed a \\"Southern Code\\" in which her family expected her to only have \\"formal relations with blacks.\\" Boyle grew up with black servants, who she was allowed to be friends with until she turned twelve and was inducted into the \\"Southern Code.\\" She also grew up with stories about her family, which also included the Revolutionary War general, Hugh Mercer, and the \\"great legal mind,\\" John Mercer Patton. Her father also worked to instill a sense of Christian morality and encouraged Boyle to right the wrongs she saw in the world. Boyle was home-schooled because of dyslexia and didn't learn to read until she was in her teens. As a young adult, she went to the Corcoran School of Art. In 1932, she married drama and speech professor, E. Roger Boyle. They had two sons together; E. Roger Boyle, III was born in 1939 and Patton Lindsay Boyle was born in 1943. Also in the 1940s, she and her husband began to see that they were incompatible as a married couple and were later divorced in 1965. Until her sons were in their late teens, she was housewife, but around 1950, she began to write magazine articles. At the university, she had become friends with a black woman who was able to pass as white. She also began to question her prejudices after hearing her father give a speech at Howard University. Boyle became involved loosely with Gregory Swanson, who was admitted to the University of Virginia law school in 1950 after a lawsuit was filed since he'd previously been denied entry due to his race. Swanson's case affected Boyle strongly because she had wrongly \\"assumed that blacks did not associate with whites because blacks preferred it that way.\\" The Swanson case showed her that not all blacks desired segregation and Boyle began to feel that segregation was truly wrong. She wrote to him to welcome him to the university, thinking that she was one of many white people who agreed that segregation was wrong. Through her involvement with Swanson she eventually met T. J. Sellers, the editor of the black newspaper in Charlottesville, The Tribune. During this time, she became one of a few white supporters of desegregation in Virginia, writing hundreds of articles and speeches imploring immediate integration. Her fight for desegregation was praised by name in Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \\"Letter from Birmingham Jail.\\" Boyle died in Arlington, Virginia inside her home due to complications from Alzheimer's disease. She was buried near where she was born.  Civil rights activism  Boyle's first letter was to the Richmond Times-Dispatch, called a \\"Plea for Tolerance.\\" Boyle believed that whites and blacks alike would reply in kind, but instead she found silence from the community at large, which she interpreted as fear to speak out. In 1951, Reader's Digest offered her a chance to write about Swanson and his case, however, after showing her essay to Swanson himself, he \\"denounced her words without explanation and walked away,\\" and Boyle never published her work. Swanson said that \\"While her heart may be in the right place, she possesses strains of paternalism which I utterly deplore.\\" After consulting other black ministers and editors, she found similar responses, which T. J. Sellers pointed out that she was paternalistic and condescending in tone. Later, Boyle would look back at her writing and how she felt, and realize that she was \\"motivated largely by class pretensions and a self-styled 'maternalism' that she later repudiated.\\" Boyle wanted to unlearn her racial prejudices and Sellers became her teacher and close friend. Their conversations were humorously referred to by one another as the \\"T. J. Sellers Course for Backward Southern Whites.\\" Boyle became an outspoken advocate for immediate integration through her conversations with Sellers. She began to write regularly for Sellers's paper in a weekly column called \\"From Behind the Curtain.\\" Her works were considered to be about \\"the development and maintenance of good human relations between all people.\\" Boyle became part of the public attention in 1954 when she spoke at the Virginia General Assembly's Commission on Public Education where she advocated school integration. On August 29, 1956, the Ku Klux Klan burned a cross in her front yard, most likely in response to her article \\"Southerners Will Like Integration\\" for the Saturday Evening Post. Instead of being afraid, Boyle was reported to laugh and called for her teen son to take a picture of the cross. The purpose of her article for the Post was to convince white Southerners that integration could be done amicably, however the way the article was received by white readers called to mind the idea of \\"interracial sex\\" because of the title and the picture of Boyle walking with two black male medical students. Boyle received hate mail and threatening phone calls in addition to the burning cross. She was also \\"subjected to repeated snubs and slights\\" and while her friends agreed with her in private, \\"none sided with her in public.\\" Boyle was part of the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. In 1964, she was arrested at a civil rights demonstration at the Monson Motor Lodge in St. Augustine, Florida. She and 11 other activists were arrested while they performed a sit-in at the restaurant at the motor lodge. Boyle retired from her activism in 1967. She found that her personal convictions clashed with the \\"realpolitik of the late 1960s.\\" However, she continued to write and explored the topic of age discrimination during her retirement.  Legacy  Boyle was honored by the City of Charlottesville for her work in civil rights on May 8, 2001. Her name also appears on a bronze plaque on the Drewary Brown Bridge recognizing her as \\"bridge builder.\\" Boyle's papers are located at the University of Virginia Library in the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library.

Taylor is most well known for his acrylic paintings, mixed media sculptures, and installations. Life Henry Taylor was born the youngest of eight brothers and sisters in Ventura, California, to a father who was employed by the U.S. government as a commercial painter and is listed as a painter on Henry's birth certificate. Raised in Oxnard, California, Henry took art classes at Oxnard College under James Jarvaise, who became an ongoing mentor. After 10 years of working as a psychiatric technician at Camarillo State Mental Hospital, Taylor retired in 1997. He attended the California Institute for the Arts, where in 1995, he obtained his Bachelor's of Fine Art. IBSN: 978-0-9821195-1-8 Work Taylor's largest output of work is in portraiture: he is known to paint obsessively, on various materials, including empty cigarette packs, detergent boxes, cereal boxes, suitcases, crates, bottles, furniture, and stretched canvas. His subjects include family, friends, patients (when employed at the hospital), acquaintances, strangers, waitresses, celebrities, homeless people, himself, and also historical figures, cultural figures, sports heroes, politicians, and individuals from photographs or other art works. At times, Taylor collapses time periods and spaces, as in Cicely and Miles Visit the Obamas (2017): in this work, Cicely Tyson and Miles Davis‚Äîpainted after a famous photograph of the couple from 1968‚Äîare seen in front of the White House, alluding to their imaginary visit to the Obamas. Taylor's painterly style has been variously described as sensuous, vibrant, bold, fast and loose, full of empathy, generosity, and love, and the visual equivalent to blues music, while retaining a profound critical social sensibility. His work has been lauded for maintaining an impossible balance between careful and sophisticated art-world references with a seemingly spontaneous and natural expressiveness. Taylor's oeuvre has been aligned within various American lineages, including the portraiture tradition of Alice Neel, and the work of Harlem Renaissance painters such as Jacob Lawrence and Romare Bearden, and compared with his peer Kerry James Marshall.  Exhibitions  Taylor's important exhibitions include a mid-career retrospective at MoMA PS1, along with solo exhibitions at the Studio Museum in Harlem, Artpace, and the Santa Monica Museum of Art, along with group exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, the Hammer Museum, the Carnegie Museum of Art, the Rubell Museum, and the Bruce High Quality Foundation.

They are an important historical document for the reign of the Ancient Egyptian king Amenemhat II (about 1929‚Äì1895 BC), but also for the history of Ancient Egypt and understanding kingship in general. The first fragment of these annals was found in 1908 at Memphis, by excavations under Flinders Petrie. The fragment was published in 1909.W.M. Flinders Petrie, with a chapter by J.H. Walker. Memphis I. London 1909, pl. V A second and much bigger fragment was discovered by Gerhard Haeny and raised in 1974 by Sami Farag, who was at this time director for Egyptian antiquities in Memphis and Saqqara. It was found under the base of a colossal statue of king Ramses II and was used there as supporting stone. The latter fragment is high, wide and about thick.Hartwig Altenm√ºller: Zwei Annalenfragmente aus dem fr√ºhen Mittleren Reich, Hamburg 2015, , 4 The fragment contains the remains of 41 columns describing events in the reign of king Amenemhat II. A high number of these events are reports of offerings made to different deities and temples all around the country. However, there also appear military enterprises. In column 7 there is mentioned the sending of a mission to the Lebanon region. In the following column there is a report of another mission to Asia for destroying Iuaa.Altenm√ºller: Zwei Annalenfragmente, 26-28 In column 9/10 appears a report of the coming of people from Kush (Nubia) and Ubatsepet. The latter place is otherwise only rarely attested but might be south of Nubia. The people brought tributes, such as plants, incense, gold, weapons, but also head rests and even wigs.Altenm√ºller: Zwei Annalenfragmente, 34-45 In column 12 is mentioned the coming of the children of the ruler from Asia. They bring tributes to Egypt. Children of the ruler does not necessarily mean that the actual children of the local ruler came, but in a wider context, can signify the people of a ruler.Altenm√ºller: Zwei Annalenfragmente, 45 Column 18 reports the destruction of the Asian towns Iuai and Iasy and the bringing of 1554 prisoners to Egypt.Altenm√ºller: Zwei Annalenfragmente, 67-71 Then, in column 25 is mentioned that the prisoners were placed in the pyramid town Sekhem-Amenemhat (perhaps the name of Amenemhat II's pyramid town), most likely for building the White Pyramid.Altenm√ºller: Zwei Annalenfragmente, 116-117 Column 13/14 reports the return of an expedition from the Sinai. The main material brought back was turquoise, but also other minerals (most of the Egyptian words in the text are not yet identified) and petrified wood. There are several expeditions to the Sinai known, that date under Amenemhat II. For several reasons it seems most likely that the text refers to the one datable to year 29 of the king, providing a rough timeframe for the events mentioned on this fragment of the stone.Altenm√ºller: Zwei Annalenfragmente, 49-54 In column 23 there is a report of the king being in Fayum for catching birds. This is almost the only time that the king appears in the text as the main person acting. The catching of birds has most likely a ritual function.Altenm√ºller: Zwei Annalenfragmente, 101-108 The dating of the annals within the reign of king Amenemhat II is uncertain. There is no year dating within the preserved texts. There are otherwise only a few indications. In column 10 appears the statue of the overseer of marshland dwellers Ameny. This person is also known from a rock inscription in Southern Egypt, dated to year 43 of Senusret I. On the fragment found by Petrie appears a statue of the vizier Ameny. Until year 8 of Amenemhat II, the vizier Senusret was in office. Therefore, this part of the inscription must relate to events after year 8, as the vizier Ameny must have been in office after year 8. On the other side there are events mentioned that might relate to the Sed festival of the king, that happened around year 30 of the king's reign.Altenm√ºller: Zwei Annalenfragmente, 286 It is not known where these annals were once placed. It seems possible that they once decorated the funerary temple of Amenemhat II at his pyramid at Dahshur.Altenm√ºller: Zwei Annalenfragmente, 282-83 In the text there are mentioned several foreign locations; many of them are not known from other sources and are therefore hard to identify. Hartwig Altenm√ºller who published a full study of the text follows Wolfgang Helck who identifies Iasy with Alasia (Cyprus) and Iuai with Ura in modern Turkey. If these identifications are correct they testify to Egyptian military enterprise much farther away than previously thought.Altenm√ºller: Zwei Annalenfragmente, 297-306  References   External links  *Annals of Amenemhat II (the fragment found by Petrie) Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt ","title":"Annals of Amenemhat II"},{"id":"48650168","text":"Jon Brittain (born May 1987) is an Olivier Award-winning playwright, comedy writer and director who was born in Chester in the northwest of England and grew up in the Netherlands.

The first stanza is a rephrasing of the biblical story of the visit of Mary to Elisabeth, ending in Mary's song of praise known as the Magnificat. The second stanza speaks to present-day listeners, urging them to follow Mary's example and go over the mountains, be inspired, support each other, and sing the Magnificat. Eccard scored the piece in E-flat major for five vocal parts (soprano 1 and 2, alto, tenor and bass). Thirty-three years after Eccard's death, the motet was included in the collection ', published in Berlin in 1644. Originally intended for the feast of the Visitation, it is now often performed during Advent.  Background and text  Divi Blasii The author of the text was Ludwig Helmbold, who was a minister at the Marienkirche in M√ºhlhausen from 1571. Eccard, who was born in M√ºhlhausen and returned there during the winter of 1573‚Äì74 when he was twenty, became acquainted with Helmbold and set many of his texts to music during the course of his life. Helmboldt's poem in two stanzas is based on the biblical narration from the Gospel of Luke of the visit of Mary to her relative Elisabeth (). Both stanzas end in a short version of the Magnificat. The scholar Schalom Ben-Chorin argues that a young woman educated at the synagogue and celebrating Jewish feasts would have been able to know the verses from the Thora which form the Magnificat. 1\\\\. Mary is depicted as traveling over the mountains (\\"\\"). Elisabeth greets her as the Lord's mother (\\"\\"), Mary became cheerful and sang (\\"\\"). At this point a short version of the Magnificat forms the chorus of both stanzas, which follows the beginning closely but then stresses, that he is my Saviour (\\"\\"), who should be feared and who will always be merciful (\\"\\"). The second stanza encourages listeners to follow the example, and also go to the mountains and tell each other, inspired by the spirit (the chorus): My soul magnifies the Lord (\\"\\").  Music  Johannes Eccard, the composer Johannes Eccard was a student of Orlandus Lassus. Eccard was also \\"one of the principal Protestant composers of chorale motets\\" in his time‚Äî√úbers Gebirg Maria geht was one of his chorale motets, and was published posthumously in ', the second of two such collections published in 1642 and 1644, which featured works of Eccard and his student Johann Stobaeus for five to eight voices. These chorale motets are said to have demonstrated that Eccard \\"was a 'true disciple of the world-famous and celebrated Orlandi [Lassus], and those such as √úbers Gebirg Maria geht \\"reflect the intrinsic warmth of Helmbold's verse\\". Eccard set the piece in E-flat major and scored it for five vocal parts (soprano 1 and 2, alto, tenor and bass. In the beginning, the lower four voices are mostly in homophony, while the top soprano enters later. The beginning of the chorus (\\"\\") is sung by the sopranos and tenor, joined by the other voices for \\"\\" (my spirit rejoices in God). In the following \\"\\", all five voices are in homophony for the only time in the composition. The fear of God is expressed in low register, while a descending line, which the voices render in imitation, is an image for the concluding mercy. He composed the motet for the feast of the Visitation. It is now often performed during Advent and recorded in collections of Advent hymns and Christmas carols.

Cesare Alessandro Scaglia (1592‚Äì1641) was an Italian cleric and diplomat of the 17th century. He was also abbot of Staffarda Abbey. He served in Rome, Paris and London as an ambassador for the House of Savoy, also collecting antiquities for the duchy. He was also in the service of Philip IV of Spain in London (acting on behalf of Spain up to 1636) and assisted Charles I of England in negotiating a commission on the subject of Cupid and Psyche from Jacob Jordaens for the Queen's House in Greenwich. However, his support of Spain led to tensions with Victor Amadeus I when he succeeded to the Duchy of Savoy in 1630, meaning that soon afterwards Scaglia retired to Brussels and Antwerp, both in the Spanish Netherlands. Peter Paul Rubens (a diplomat himself) described Scaglia as \\"a man of the keenest intellect\\". Scaglia was an art collector and commissioned a portrait, a Virgin and Child (showing Scaglia himself praying to them) and a Deposition (intended for his tomb) from Antony van Dyck whilst in Brussels and Antwerp. There were a total of five van Dycks in his collection, which also contained works by Peter Snayers and Antonio Tempesta.

Opitz (born August 15, 1935) is a German-American medical geneticist and professor at the University of Utah School of Medicine. He is best known for rediscovering the concept of the developmental field in humans (first enunciated by Hans Spemann in amphibians) and for his detection and delineation of many genetic syndromes, several now known as the \\"Opitz syndromes\\" including Smith‚ÄìLemli‚ÄìOpitz syndrome (SLOS), Opitz‚ÄìKaveggia syndrome (FGS1), Opitz G/BBB syndrome, Bohring‚ÄìOpitz syndrome, and other autosomal and X-linked conditions. He is founder of the Wisconsin Clinical Genetics Center, the American Journal of Medical Genetics, and the American College and American Board of Medical Genetics.  Early life  John M. Opitz was born in Hamburg, Germany, on August 15, 1935 to a middle-class family. His father died of tuberculosis while Opitz was still young, a disease which he also contracted and, caused him to spend 14 months in a sanatorium. After seven years of separation, he rejoined his mother in 1947 in Nuremberg where she worked as an interpreter for the US occupation forces during the war- crimes trials. They immigrated to the United States in 1950, eventually settling in Iowa City where Opitz' uncle, Hans Koelbel, was Professor of Cello and Chamber Music at the University of Iowa.  Education  It was at the age of 15 that his uncle introduced him to Emil Witschi, an internationally acclaimed embryologist, endocrinologist, and zoologist at the University of Iowa, who fanned Opitz' interest in embryology, genetics and evolution. After completing high school, Opitz' studied Zoology at the University of Iowa under Witschi's tutelage, receiving his bachelor's degree in 1956. With the approach of Witschi's retirement from the University of Iowa just previous to his graduation, Opitz wondered where he would go next as his previous plan had been to complete a PhD under Witschi. However, with some prodding from his mother, he was reluctantly persuaded to attend medical school at the University of Iowa. His initial lack of interest dissipated as he was immersed in the world of clinical medicine. He continued his work with Witschi while in medical school, completing a joint review on the biology of sex determination and sex differentiation in animals (Witschi, Opitz, 1961). While attending medical school, Opitz was engaged in a variety of other research projects including: glucose metabolism (with N. Halmi), prostate cancer (R. Flocks), and hereditary hematuria (W.W. McCrory). Others who influenced Opitz while in medical school include Hans Zellweger and Jacqueline A. Noonan. He completed his medical degree in 1959 at the University of Iowa, also a rotating internship and his first year of pediatric residency.  Career   University of Wisconsin  After completion of residency, Opitz searched for fellowship opportunities. He had followed closely the work of Patau, Inhorn and Smith in Madison on human aneuploidy and so, after application and acceptance, July 1, 1961 saw Opitz at the University of Wisconsin where he completed residency, the last 6 months as pediatric chief resident. He completed his fellowship (1962-1964) in Medical Genetics under Klaus Patau, and David W. Smith. Smith introduced him to the University of Wisconsin Children's Hospital where he began his work on the physical and biological manifestations of syndromes. He also gained experience in the evaluation of normal developmental variability by examining the newborn infants at St. Mary's Hospital in Madison for Smith's study of minor anomalies. It was during the 60's that Opitz set the groundwork on the scientific advances for which he would be best known- the discovery and definition of multiple congenital anomalies syndromes through the recognition of links between pediatric anomalies and heredity. After completion of his fellowship, Opitz was appointed Assistant Professor of Medical Genetics and Pediatrics at the University of Wisconsin. He spent 18 years at UW-Madison where he was able to establish the Wisconsin Clinical Genetics Center in 1974 as well as a fetal/pediatric pathology and developmental pathology program in association with Dr. Enid Gilbert-Barness.  Shodair- Montana State University  In 1979, at the invitation of Philip D. Pallister, Opitz left the University of Wisconsin to become the Director of the Shodair-Montana Regional Genetic Service Program in Helena, Montana. This program included such services as cytogenetics and fetal genetic pathology. Later he served as chair of the Department of Medical Genetics at Shodair Children's Hospital and as an adjunct professor in Biology, History and Philosophy, Medicine, and Veterinary Science at Montana State University. In 1994 he was appointed Professor of Medical Humanities. In Montana, Opitz continued research in genetic syndromes, often collaborating with Phil D. Pallister, leading to the discovery of several syndromes including the Pallister-Hall, KBG, and Pallister-Killian syndromes. This collaboration also led to the discovery of the first human X-autosome translocation which, according to McKusick, was a jumping off point for the era of chromosome mapping. Prior to leaving Montana, Opitz traveled to Germany to become the first visiting professor of the Hanseatic University Foundation of the University of L√ºbeck, Department of Genetics.  University of Utah  In 1997, Opitz joined the faculty at the University of Utah School of Medicine as a Professor of Pediatrics in the division of Medical Genetics and also as a member of the clinical staff at the Children's Medical Center. He holds adjunct appointments in the Departments of Human Genetics, Pathology, and Obstetrics and Gynecology. He was an active participant in the fetal genetic pathology program in the Division of Pediatric Pathology at Primary Children's Medical Center until 2015.  Research  Opitz' research and interests, in addition to clinical genetics, have covered a wide spectrum of genetic anomalies with focuses on sex determination and sex differentiation, skeletal dysplasias, mental retardation, human malformations and syndromes and the relationship between evolution and development.  \\"Opitz Syndromes\\"  Opitz' work on identifying the physical and biological symptoms of genetic disorders led to the discovery of the \\"Opitz syndromes\\" and created an impetus for important basic science advances. These include documentation of the role of cholesterol in vertebrate development after description of the Smith-Lemli- Opitz syndrome or of the role of the MID1 gene in early ontogeny following discovery of the Opitz GBBB syndrome(s). An abbreviated list of the syndromes to which Dr. Opitz has contributed or for which he was the first descriptor include: * Bohring‚ÄìOpitz syndrome * C syndrome * Cornelia de Lange syndrome  N syndrome * Noonan syndrome * Opitz G/BBB syndrome * Opitz‚ÄìKaveggia syndrome (FGS1) * Smith‚ÄìLemli‚ÄìOpitz syndrome (SLOS) * Zellweger syndrome  Spemann's developmental field  In biology, Opitz' most important contribution was the reintroduction of the developmental field concept linking human evolution, genetics, and development. The discovery by Hans Spemann in 1922 of the \\"organizer\\" identified the \\"primary\\" field. Clinically, radius dysgenesis was defined as a developmental field defect on the basis of causal heterogeneity. Developmental fields are now known as the basic morphogenetic units of the vertebrate embryo. From a phylogenetic perspective, field theory was expanded in recent years to \\"modularity\\".  Editorial and published works  In 1976, Opitz founded and became Editor-in-Chief of the American Journal of Medical Genetics. Opitz retired as editor-in-chief of the AJMG in 2001 and was succeeded by John C. Carey. Opitz still serves as an emeritus editor for the journal. Opitz has written over 500 papers and textbook chapters and edited 12 books.

The Kit allows to transfer from a live computer, from a backup of a computer, or directly from an old computer's hard drive. This is the Pro version of Zinstall's migration product line.  Operation  Zinstall Migration Kit Pro supports several transfer scenarios (see below). In all of the scenarios, the product transfers the user workspace from one computer to another, including applications, settings and files \\\\- unless the user applies a selective transfer as described below.  Transfer scenarios   Direct PC to PC transfer  In this scenario, the transfer is done directly from one \\"live\\" machine to another \\"live\\" machine. The transfer is done over some form of network connection - router, network, direct cable or a wireless connection. In order to initial the transfer, the user should run the software on old and new computers, which then auto-locate each other on the network. The transfer is then initiated on the new computer. The old computer is not changed and nothing is removed from it.  Transfer directly from old PC's hard drive  In this scenario, the transfer is done directly from the old (source) machine's hard drive. The drive can be connected externally (USB adapter / enclosure), or internally, as a secondary drive. This scenario works even for old computers that are unable to boot, as long as the data is intact.  Indirect transfer (via network storage / external drive)  In this scenario, the source machine is captured into a Container file, which can be stored on an external USB drive, a network share, or any other location. This container is then moved over to the target machine, and migration is completed there. The advantage of this transfer scenario is that it does not require the machines to be live at the same time, or to be in the same physical location. In fact, it can even be used for in-place upgrade or migration to Cloud.  Transfer options  In all transfer scenarios, these options are available:  Selective Migration  User is able to select which programs are transferred or not. Same selectivity is available for files, folders, user profiles and registry entries.  Profile-only Migration  A special mode which allows to transfer everything except the actual programs, without performing a detailed selection.  SSD Mode  Splits the transfer from one source drive to two separate drives on the target. Intended for use on hybrid SSD/HDD targets, where a primary SSD is smaller than the original drive, and the secondary HDD is used for data storage. Zinstall Migration Kit Pro supports Windows XP and higher, both on source and on target of the transfer, including Windows 10. Transfers from 32-bit to 64-bit systems are supported as well.

History  Majuro Atoll was claimed by the German Empire with the rest of the Marshall Islands in 1884, and the Germans established a trading outpost. As with the rest of the Marshalls, Majuro was captured by the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1914 during World War I and mandated to the Empire of Japan by the League of Nations in 1920. The island then became a part of the Japanese mandated territory of the South Seas Mandate; although the Japanese had established a government in the mandate, local affairs were mostly left in the hands of traditional local leaders until the start of World War II.

The main reason for freshwater acidification is atmospheric depositions and soil leaching of SOx and NOx. In an acid-sensitive ecosystem, which includes slow- weathering bedrock and depleted base cation pools, SOx and NOx from runoff will be accompanied by acidifying hydrogen ions and inorganic aluminum, which can be toxic to marine organisms. Acid rain is also a contributor to freshwater acidification, however acid rain is formed when SOx and NOx react with water, oxygen and oxidants within the clouds. In addition to SOx and NOx, the buffering capacity of soils and bedrocks within the freshwater ecosystem can contribute to the acidity of the water. Each freshwater reservoir has a capacity to buffer acids. However, with excess input of acids into the reservoir, the buffering capacity will essentially ‚Äúrun out‚Äù and the water will eventually become more acidic. Increase in atmospheric CO2 affects freshwater acidity very similarly to the way rising CO2 affects ocean ecosystems. However, because of the various carbon fluxes in freshwater ecosystems, it is difficult to quantify the effects of anthropogenic CO2. Finally, rising freshwater acidification is harmful to various aquatic organisms.  Freshwater vs. Ocean Acidification  A basic summary of the relationship between anthropogenic CO2 and ocean acidification. The ocean and the atmosphere are constantly exchanging massive amounts of CO2. Over the last 800 000 years, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere remained around 172-300 parts per million by volume (ppmv). However, with recent anthropogenic CO2 emissions, this number has increased to 387 ppmv in 2009. From 2000-2008, 26% of anthropogenic CO2 was absorbed by the ocean. Although ocean acidification is also caused by other chemical additions and removals, CO2 is the primary factor affecting pH. Once CO2 is dissolved in seawater, it becomes a weak acid that primarily affects carbonate chemistry. Dissolved CO2 increases the concentration of bicarbonate ions (HCO3‚àí), dissolved inorganic carbon (CT) and lowers the pH. Freshwater also absorbs atmospheric CO2, which can also lower the pH. In addition to CO2, freshwater reservoir's pH values are altered by acid rain, nutrient runoff, and other anthropogenic pollutants. Freshwater uptakes CO2 in the same mechanism as seawater, however, freshwater alkalinity is much lower than seawater, due to the absence of a salt-buffer. Due to the lack of salt-buffer, pH changes in freshwater tend to be much greater than ocean water, due to newly released H+ ions not being buffered by as many bicarbonate (HCO3‚àí) ions as ocean water. Therefore, the freshwater biota tends to have a higher evolutionary pH tolerance than seawater biota.  Causes   SOx and NOx  The accelerated burning of fossil fuels within the past century has largely contributed to the acidification of freshwater ecosystems. In the 1970s, the sulfate emissions levels peaked, with nitrogen following behind 10 years later. The main contributors to freshwater acidification are SOx and NOx. Increases in sulfate concentration in runoff, due to increased acidity inputs, is coupled with an increase in base cation run-off and bicarbonate decrease, creating the acidifying effect seen in freshwater ecosystems. In a natural state, most nitrogen inputted into freshwater ecosystems will be utilized by vegetation. However, in excess amounts, all of the nitrogen is unable to be utilized by vegetation, and excess nitrogen is found as nitrate in the water's runoff. Nitrate will contribute to acidification in the same manner as sulfate.  Buffering Capacity  A map depicting Atlantic Canada. In addition to SOx and NOx, low buffering capacities of ecosystems can also lead to freshwater acidity. For example, Atlantic Canada has the lowest acid deposition rates in Eastern North America, with the most acidic waters on the continent. This is due to the low buffering of the regional bedrock and the addition of natural organic acids produced by close by wetlands. Specifically, in Southwestern and Eastern Nova Scotia, there is a combination of high organic acidity, poor buffering, and high acid deposition to produce a very low surface water pH and acid neutralization capacity (ANC) values. In most of the Atlantic region, granite and shale bedrock are found, which contain very little buffering material. Soil formed from low-buffering materials and the waters that drain from them are, therefore, susceptible to acidification, even under low acid deposition.  CO2  In oceans, CO2 in the atmosphere can dissolve into the water's surface, and forms carbonic acid. The total inorganic carbon in freshwater involves free CO2 (or H2CO3), HCO3‚àí and carbonate (CO32-). The percentage of all these constituents is also dependent on the pH of the body of water. When water is acidic it will primarily contain CO2. It is often difficult to quantify the effects of pCO2 levels in freshwater due to the various sources of carbon dioxide freshwater ecosystems receive. Factors such as nearby ecosystem, agriculture, land use, watershed, lake size, precipitation, soil type and rocks all determine the amount of CO2 absorbed. However, there has been a clear increase in pCO2 in freshwater ecosystems in the last century due to anthropogenic influence. As the vegetation near freshwater ecosystems grow larger and multiply, due to the excess pCO2 feeding these plants, the carbon available at death and during decomposition increases. Then, precipitation, weathering and runoff will wash this soil into the nearby water. When the pCO2 from the decomposing vegetation reacts with the water, it forms carbonic acid, which contributes to a lower pH level.  Harmful Effects on Aquatic Ecosystems  This pond shows an overabundance of Sphagnum. With increased acidification in freshwater ecosystems, there will be a decrease in biodiversity, with the increased loss of acid-sensitive species. A fall in pH to 6 would drastically affect both snail and crustacean's species within freshwater. For example, within the Norwegian lakes, these species represent 45% of the trout's food source, resulting in a 10-30% reduction in trout due to freshwater acidification. In addition, zooplankton's species diversity is affected by freshwater acidification. In most acidic freshwater reservoirs, there will be an increase in the development of mosses and algae. In particular, it is common to see an increase in the abundance of the moss Sphagnum. Sphagnum has a high capacity to exchange H+ for basic cations within freshwater. The thick layer of Sphagnum is restricting the exchange between surface water and sediment, which further contributes to reduction in nutrient cycling in the ecosystem.

In 2015 it became the first healthcare online platform in Malaysia that provides such services. History BookDoc was founded in July 2015 by former BP Healthcare Group managing director Datuk Chevy Beh, and co- founded by Groupon Malaysia founder Joel Neoh Eu-Jin. The app was inspired after a friend of Beh's had a near-death experience. His friend came down with dengue fever. After initially not being diagnosed with such, he was sent home. Three days later his condition worsened and he went to the hospital to be admitted. He was not immediately admitted and his condition worsened. Beh was able to contact the hospital and arrange for his friend's expedited admission, which physicians mentioned saved his life. Beh had a background in the health care industry and began developing BookDoc as a way to connect patients to health care providers. The goal of the app is to expedite diagnosis and patient care. It was officially launched as an app in October 2015. The company received its first funding in September 2015.

It was founded in 2011 by Jonathan Sobczyk and Simon Coyle, with partner organisations including The Sutton Trust, Teach First, Challenge Partners and Goldman Sachs. It is led by Dr Chris Wilson (CEO), Ciara Lynch (COO) and Richard Eyre (Chief Programmes Officer). The organisation has offices in London, Leeds, Birmingham and Cardiff, and is present in all regions of England as well as Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Activities The Brilliant Club runs two programmes. In The Scholars Programme, doctoral and postdoctoral researchers deliver academic tutorials in non-selective state schools to pupils aged 10 to 18. Researchers delivering the programme are called PhD tutors and they are recruited, trained and placed by programme officers. During The Scholars Programme, pupils have seven tutorials with their PhD tutor which include weekly reading and writing assignments that lead to the completion of a final assignment. This assignment is marked thoroughly by PhD tutors and given a university style grade (1st, 2:1, 2:2 etc.). Programmes begin with a Launch Trip at a highly-selective university, where pupils will have a campus tour, receive information advice and guidance from the university and meet their PhD tutor for the first time. The Programme finishes with a graduation event at another highly-selective university to celebrate the completion of The Scholars Programme. For the older pupils, PhD tutors design the courses based on their own area of research, whilst for younger pupils standardised courses are delivered. The Brilliant Club requires at least 55% of its pupils to meet at least one of its targeting criteria - educational measures of deprivation, no parental history of higher education, and deprivation according to postcode. The organisation's second programme, Researchers in Schools, is a teacher training programme unique to candidates with a PhD, which began in 2014. The programme aims to increase subject expertise, promote research and champion university access in schools. Expansion The organisation began with a pilot programme in North London in 2011, and in 2013‚Äì14, they delivered programmes to almost 4,600 pupils in over 150 schools. Since then, the programme has expanded to schools across England, the Midlands, North, East, South-East,South-West., Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In 2017‚Äì18, The Brilliant Club worked with 12,254 pupils across its programmes and special projects, in 714 schools. Conference The Brilliant Club holds an annual conference. This began in 2015, and was held in conjunction with King's College London and had the theme: ‚ÄòWhere can we find solutions to break the link between household income and admission to the UK‚Äôs highly-selective universities?‚Äô. In 2018, The Brilliant Club welcomed delegates from schools and universities, charities and other organisations, as well as policy makers and researchers, to collaborate on this year's theme, Measuring Up: Research, Evidence and Urgency in University Access and Student Success. The charity's 2019 conference, Ready or Not? Collaborating Towards Curricula for University Readiness, will be held on Friday 12 July. Recognition and awards In 2011, The Brilliant Club was named the winner of a Teach First Social Innovation Award. In the same year it was one of the top ten Future 100 winners and in 2012, The Brilliant Club was listed as one of Britain's 50 New Radicals by Nesta and The Observer. In 2013, the organisation joined Ernst & Young's Accelerate programme. It was used as a case study by Equity Ideas, and mentioned in Ofsted's 2015 report 'The Most Able Students, an update in progress since June 2013'. In December 2015, the charity was named as one of The Guardian's Charity Award winners for 2015. In 2019, The Brilliant Club was awarded second place in The Sunday Times 100 Best Not-For-Profit Organisations to work for list. It was also named as one of the 75 Best Small Companies in London. The Scholar The Scholar is The Brilliant Club's academic journal of pupil work. It is published termly and showcases some of the work produced by pupils on The Scholars Programme and Uni Pathways. All assignments nominated for publication are reviewed by an expert panel of PhD researchers and only the highest scoring are published. The Scholar is the country's only academic journal dedicated to publishing university-style assignments authored by school pupils. Publishing original work is an important part of academia and introduces pupils not only to the world of research but also to the next stages of peer review and publication in academic journals.

The unit charged with conducting individual, platoon and collective training and provides medical support to other units undergoing training, as well as operating a Brigade Medical Station (BMS) for brigade- level exercises in various training areas in British Columbia and Washington State. Operating the BMS is done in conjunction with 12 (Vancouver) Field Ambulance, which illustrates the close cooperation that exists between the two units.  History  This unit has a long and distinguished history that lives up to the former Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps (RCAMC) motto - faithful in adversity. It is the latest in a line of Victoria army medical units dating back to 13th Canadian Field Ambulance of World War I.  World War I  13 Field Ambulance (Fd Amb) was mobilized in Victoria on 22 March 1916 and departed Canada July 1 on the S.S. Matagama. The unit arrived in England July 9 where they received training in stretcher drill with and without ambulances and practical field ambulance work in conjunction with infantry units. The unit was fully equipped with tentage, medical equipment and ambulances and departed from Southampton, August 12 for the front lines in Belgium. * The Battle of the Somme was the first heavy action seen by 13 Fd Amb and the Canadian Corps The battle was brutal with the Canadians suffering a total of 23,734 casualties.541x541px * The Canadian victory at Vimy Ridge has gone down as one of the great feats in military history. 13 Fd Amb was the Corps clearing centre for walking wounded during Vimy and saw 4,360 casualties during the full three days of the battle. The largest number held at any one time was 2,650. The clearing of casualties from the front lines to the advanced dressing stations was very rapid although evacuation rearward was delayed due to a lack of ambulances * The conditions facing the medical service Passchendaele were daunting yet despite a high number of casualties (16,404) the medical service proved to be up to the task with 12,403 coming between 26 Oct through 11 Nov. General Currie had predicted 16,000 casualties would be the result of the battle and he was very close in his estimate.  World War II  On September 2, 1939, 13 Field Ambulance, now quartered at the Bay Street Armoury, was mobilized with six officers and forty other ranks from the Militia. On October 27, 1941, the unit was renamed \\"No. 13 Light Field Ambulance\\" and tasked to support the 5th Canadian Armoured Division overseas. The unit departed Canada in November 1942 for England where it received its full complement of vehicles and other equipment. In January 1943 the unit was designated 13 Canadian Field Dressing Station providing the nucleus, with attached field surgical teams and field transfusion teams, for an advanced surgical centre. Between October 1943 and January 1945 the unit supported the Canadian 5th Armoured Division in the Italian campaign seeing action at Ortona, the Liri Valley and the Gothic Line. In February 1945 the unit redeployed from Italy by road and ship to support 1st Canadian Corps in clearing western Holland of the enemy. VE Day was declared on May 8, 1945 and 13 Canadian Field Dressing Station remained in situ until June 30 when it became the first Canadian medical unit to be disbanded.  Post War  On 29 October 1954, 13 Field Ambulance CA (M) and 46 Field Hygiene Section RCAMC CA (M) were amalgamated to form 25 Medical Company RCAMC CA(M). During this period members of the unit participated in numerous peace keeping missions and served on tours in Bosnia and Croatia. The unit was re-designated in 1979 as 11 (Victoria) Medical Company. In 1994 the unit was accorded the Freedom of the Municipality of Saanich  2000 to Present  In 2007 the unit was renamed 11(Victoria) Field Ambulance.

His early work included public houses for the Godsell Brewery work included the designing of new country houses or partially rebuilding existing houses. He also designed country house gardens and is noted for laying out Highfields Park, Nottingham together with the adjacent Nottingham University Campus. His early work was in the Arts and Crafts style, but after the First World War his buildings were increasingly in the Neo-Georgian fashion. He undertook architectural work in many parts of the British Isles including Ireland and at Thurso in Caithness. He is probably best remembered for the Trent Building in the University of Nottingham.Parks & Gardens UK and for design of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. His work at Upton House, Warwickshire for Viscount Bearsted is notable, but it is his work for Jesse Boot, both the Boot‚Äôs the Chemists stores, but most importantly the Trent Building and the laying out of the Nottingham University Campus, which influenced design at other English universities, for which he must take the greatest credit.

This was a country residence of the bishops of Winchester. It was in a badly dilapidated state and he set about restoring the building. Of this residence, the great hall, a solar, and a garderobe block survive largely intact. The Court House is remarkable for its fine state of preservation. It was commissioned by the bishop, William of Wykeham and built by his master mason William Wynford, one of the greatest of 14th-century architects, who remodelled the nave of Winchester Cathedral and designed Winchester College and New College, Oxford. Morley Horder added a north wing, joining the medieval house to the 18th century thatched cottage on the roadside, and he laid out the gardens between the house and the 18th century thatched barn on what had become a farmyard. Morley Horder also bought and restored a number of thatched cottages in the village. An account of Morley Horder's restoration work is given in a Country Life article.Arthur Oswald (1937) The Court House, East Meon, Hampshire - The Home of Mr P Morley Horder, Country Life Vol. 81, 8th May 1937 Horder appears to have been eccentric, with a domineering character: \\"To his pupils he was \\"Holy Murder\\" (a Spoonerism on his name); according to his daughter, \\"he was most charming... and most awful\\"... \\"pushing artistic temperament to its limits, [he] looked and behaved like a cantankerous Old Testament prophet.\\"‚ÄùWhyte‚Äù (2015), p. 177 Architectural work Churches and chapels *Queen's Avenue Congregational Church, Muswell Hill (1897‚Äì1900).

His father, whose surname was originally Mendes, was for some time British consul at Cuxhaven, Hanover, where Hampden and most if not all of his siblings were born. Hampden studied agricultural science in Germany from around 1822 to 1824, specialising in wool classing and sheep breeding. He was employed by the Australian Agricultural Company in 1825 to select a flock and arrived in Sydney on 22 March 1826 with a selection of around 240 sheep, though many were in poor condition and so many died subsequently that Hampden's contract was terminated. He returned to England in 1827. In 1830 Hampden and his brother Frederick Hansborough Dutton returned to Sydney. Frederick moved to Mullengandra near Albury (and later famously took up in South Australia which he called Anlaby), while Hampden had extensive properties in Monaro region of New South Wales (then generally spelled \\"Manaro\\"). He was appointed Magistrate at Yass in 1834, Justice of the Peace in Sydney. On 26 December 1838 Hampden, his wife Charlotte, and three children arrived in South Australia from Sydney aboard the ship Parland, which also carried for him a full cargo of 1,500 sheep and a number of horses.

The asteroid was discovered on 10 January 1997, by the Spacewatch survey at Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson, Arizona, United States.  Orbit and classification  is an Amor asteroid, a group of near-Earth object that approach the orbit of Earth from beyond, but do not cross it. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.1‚Äì3.7 AU once every 3 years and 8 months (1,330 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.55 and an inclination of 5¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. Published by the Digitized Sky Survey, a first precovery was taken at the Australian Siding Spring Observatory in July 1992, extending the body's observation arc by more than 4 years prior to its official discovery observation at Kitt Peak.  Close approaches  occasionally makes close approaches to Earth and Mars. It has an Earth minimum orbital intersection distance of , which is about 34.3 lunar distances. Its closest recorded approach to Earth took place on 30 August 2003, when the asteroid came within from Earth. It will come closer still on 8 October 2145, when it will be within from Earth. The asteroid will make its closest approach to Mars on 29 December 2054 when it will come within from the planet.  Physical properties   Spectral type  is a rare Q-type asteroid with a very dark surface, reflecting only about 7% of the light it receives. It has also been described a common stony S-type asteroid.  Slow rotator  The most unusual feature of , however, is its exceptionally slow rotation period of hours, or approximately 11 weeks (). It holds the record for being the slowest-rotating asteroid discovered so far. Its precise period with a smaller error margin still needs to be determined. The lightcurve also showed a high brightness variation of at least 0.6 magnitude, which is indicative for a non-spherical shape. The asteroid may also be in a tumbling motion, but observations are not sufficient to determine any non-principal axis rotation. Like other slowly-rotating asteroids such as 912 Maritima, it is possible that the extremely long period of this asteroid is caused by YORP radiation pressure slowing down the asteroid's rotation. This is especially likely considering that has a very low albedo, which would allow it to absorb more radiant energy from the Sun. Furthermore, the YORP effect has also been observed on other Q-type asteroids such as 1862 Apollo.  Diameter and albedo  According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, measures 0.847 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.186. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 0.782 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 17.9.  Naming  As of 2017, this asteroid remains unnamed.

Location Sleaty Church is located about 2.5 km (1¬Ω miles) north of Carlow town, on the west bank of the River Barrow. History A monastery was founded on the south side of the stream by Saint Fiacc (c. 415‚Äì520). According to legend, Fiacc founded the church of Domnach-Fiech, east of the River Barrow. To this church Saint Patrick presented sacred vestments, a bell, a manuscript of the Pauline Epistles and a crosier. After many years of austere life in this place, Fiacc was led by angelic command to remove to the west of the Barrow, for there \\"he would find the place of his resurrection\\". The legends state that he was directed to build his oratory where he should meet a hind (female red deer) and his refectory where he should find a boar. He consulted Patrick, the who fixed the site of his new church at Slebhte (Sletty, Sleaty). √Åed of Sletty was a seventh-century bishop of Sletty and was one of the first biographers of St. Patrick. Sletty was a historic residence of the King of Leinster. The last historical reference to Sletty is from 1055, after which the site lost importance. The two undecorated crosses date back to the monastic period, whereas the church is medieval in date, although some of the larger stones used in its construction may come from the earlier foundation: large boulders were common in early Christian construction. Buildings Church The medieval church is largely ruined. The church is in length, in width and is largely built of coursed limestone blocks, with the exception of the east gable which was rebuilt at some stage with sandstone. The granite jambs used in its construction may be taken from the earlier monastery. The only features of the church left are a broken window in the east of the south gable and a semi-pointed doorway to the west. An octagonal baptismal font, made from roughly dressed granite, stands near the doorway. it could also be recycled from the monastery. Crosses The smaller, southern of the two granite crosses from the earlier foundation is roughly high and is decorated with a rough ringed cross. The taller, western cross is high and is undecorated. It is made from a single piece of granite and features distinctive cusps where the arms meet the shaft.

The Group Fortification, built in the early XXth century, was part of a wider program of fortifications called \\"Moselstellung\\", encompassing fortresses scattered between Thionville and Metz in the valley Moselle. The aim of Germany was to protect against a French attack to take back Alsace- Lorraine from the German Empire. The fortification system was designed to accommodate the growing advances in artillery since the end of XIXth century. Based on new defensive concepts, such as dispersal and concealment, the Group Fortification was to be, in case of attack, an impassable barrier for French forces.  Overall design  At the perimeter of Group Fortification Marne protection is provided by a set of infantry positions, fortified barracks and artillery batteries scattered over a wide area and concealed by the natural topography. From 1899, the Schlieffen plan of the German General Staff designed the fortifications of the Moselstellung, between Metz and Thionville to be like a lock for blocking any advance of French troops in case of conflict.Donnell Clayton, The German Fortress of Metz: 1870-1944, Oxford, Osprey, 2008, p. 24. This concept of a fortified line on the Moselle was a significant innovation compared to syst√®me S√©r√© de Rivi√®re developed by the French. It later inspires the engineers of the Maginot Line.Donnell Clayton : The German Fortress of Metz: 1870-1944.  Construction and facilities  Covering an area of 205 ha, the Feste Freiherr von der Goltz was built from 1907 to 1916, in the woods between Jury, Mercy and Ars-Laquenexy. The fortified group has three fortified barracks which can accommodate a total of 800 men. It has 8 pieces of artillery, 6 100mm and 2 77mm guns. It has thirteen observation domes and twenty lookouts. The various items are connected by 2,000m of underground galleries.√âtat actuel des lieux sur festungsbauten.de In its water tanks, it has 860m of water. The energy required for its operation is provided by four diesel engines of 22 hp each.  Successive assignments  From 1890 the garrison relief is guaranteed by the fort troops Corps XVI stationed at Metz and Thionville. In November 1918, the fort was again occupied by the French army. After the departure of French troops in June 1940, the German army reinvests the fortifications.  Second World War  In late August 1944, at the beginning of the Battle of Metz, the German command integrates the defensive system implemented around Metz. On September 2, 1944, Metz was declared fortress Reich by Hitler. The fortress must be defended to the last by German troops, whose leaders were all sworn to the F√ºhrer.Ren√© Caboz, La bataille de Metz, √âditions Pierron, Sarreguemines, 1984, p. 132. The next day, September 3, 1944, General Krause, then commander of the fortress of Metz establishes its High Command, the main command post is in the barracks of fort Alvensleben. Fort Plappeville was indeed located west of the defenses of Metz, yet close to the center of Metz. The same day, the troops of General Krause took position on a line from Pagny-sur-Moselle to Mondelange, passing to the west of Metz by Chambley, Mars-la-Tour, Jarny and Briey. After an initial withdrawal, on 6 September 1944, the German lines now rely solidly on the western sector of the forts of Metz, especially on fortifications Lorraine, Jeanne D'Arc and Driant. The US offensive launched September 7, 1944, is cut short. US troops stop at the Moselle, despite gaining two bridgeheads south of Metz. The fortifications being better defended than they had thought, US troops are now out of breath. General McLain, in agreement with the General Walker, decided to suspend the attacks, pending further plans of the General Staff of the 90th Infantry Division.Hugh M. Cole, The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950 (pp. 176-183). While the troops of the Third US Army sit listening to Marlene Dietrich,Hugh M. Cole, The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950 (p. 190). German troops are taking advantage of the lull in fighting to reorganize. Reserve troops of the future 462th Volks-Grenadier- Division fill in, into the fortifications, with the elite troops of Colonel Siegroth.For his commitment during the Battle of Metz, SS Colonel Siegroth obtained the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, October 18, 1944. When hostilities resume after a rainy month, the soldiers of the 462th Volks- Grenadier-Division still hold firmly the forts of Metz, though supplies are more difficult under the artillery and the frequent bombings.Hugh M. Cole : The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950 (p. 256). On November 9, 1944, the Air Force sends no less than 1,299 heavy bombers, B-17s and B-24s, to drop 3,753 tons of bombs, and 1,000 to 2,000 books on the fortifications and strategic points in the combat zone of IIIrd army.G√©n√©ral Jean Colin, Contribution √† l‚Äôhistoire de la lib√©ration de la ville de Metz ; Les combats du fort Driant (septembre-d√©cembre 1944), Acad√©mie nationale de Metz, 1963 (p. 13). Most bombers, having dropped bombs without visibility at over 20 000 feet, miss their military objectives. In Metz, the 689 loads of bombs destined to strike the fort Jeanne d‚ÄôArcand six other forts, identified as priority targets, merely cause collateral damage, proving once again the inadequacy of the massive bombing of military targets.Hugh M. Cole, The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950 (p. 424). Mid- November 1944, the XIIth and XXth US Army corps are trying to take the fortifications of Metz in a pincer movement. 95th Infantry Division must focus its efforts on the western front of Metz, while 5th division must outflank the German lines north and south. The enveloping attack of the US Army finally succeeded after three days of uncertainty. On the evening of November 17, 1944, the situation of German defenders becomes critical. The able-bodied men of 462th Volks-Grenadier-Division are mostly surrounded in the forts of Metz. The remaining troops, fragmented to the extreme, hold key positions within the city.Hugh M. Cole, The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950 (p. 446). The city of Metz fell into the hands of Americans November 22, 1944, but some forts still stand, two weeks later. On December 6, 1944, Group Fortification Saint-Quentin surrenders with its large garrison. The Fort Plappeville drops its arms the next day. The Group Fortification Jeanne-d'Arc, Old Feste Empress, probably because it was controlled by the staff of the 462th Volks-Grenadier-Division and defended by a battalion of fusiliers, is the last of the forts of Metz to surrender, December 13, 1944. Determined German resistance, bad weather and floods, inopportunity, and a general tendency to underestimate the firepower of the fortifications of Metz, have helped slow the US offensive, giving the opportunity to the German Army withdraw in good order to the Saar.Hugh M. Cole, The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950, p. 448. The objective of the German staff, which was to stall US troops at Metz for the longest possible time before they could reach the front of the Siegfried Line, is largely achieved.

The Birdsell Clover Huller was invented by John Comly Birdsell in 1855 in West Henrietta, New York (near Rochester). His machine both removed the hulls from the clover (threshing), removed the seeds from the hulls (hulling), and cleaned the seeds so they can be used or sold for animal feed and/or soil nutrients. Until the mid-18th century, this work was done by hand and by animal power, requiring a tremendous amount of manual labor for a relatively small reward. Clover was becoming a major cash crop throughout the burgeoning midwest, since its seeds could be used as an animal feed and nutrient for soil. Although there were separate machines available for threshing and hulling (plus human or animal powered methods), the process to separate the seed was very labor-intensive. Birdsell believed his machine, which combined the threshing, hulling, and cleaning actions into one process, could reduce the time and energy needed, and therefore increasing the amount of seed a farmer could produce. John C. Birdsell continued to perfect his clover huller, and by 1857 he won first prize at the New York State Fair in Buffalo.Roger Birdsell, ‚ÄúBirdsell: The Invention, The Family, The Company.‚Äù Accessed November 14, 2014. http://centerforhistory.org/learn-history/business-history/birdsell-clover- huller-company . By the end of the 19th century, the Birdsell Clover Huller was the most popular clover huller in the United States. A farmer who invested a few hundred dollars in a Birdsell Clover Huller could use the seeds on his own farm as well as sell the excess to other farms. As the midwest replaced the east as the agricultural center of the United States, machines like the Birdsell Clover Huller (along with the Oliver Chilled Plow, the John Deere tractor, and a host of other new farm technologies) contributed towards America‚Äôs shift from small, subsistence level farming to large, industrial farming.

History Following the radical right-wing ideological turnout within the Green Party of Hungary (MZP), several environmentalist members decided to left the party and establish the Green Alternative in June 1993 during their first congress at the University of Horticulture (today a faculty within the Corvinus University of Budapest). The congress elected Gy√∂rgy Droppa (a former Duna K√∂r and SZDSZ member) and Erzs√©bet Schmuck (a former KISZ member) as co- presidents. In January 1994, MDF politician and MP K√°roly J√°vor (father of MEP Benedek J√°vor) joined the ZA, providing parliamentary representation for the party for few months until the 1994 parliamentary election, when ZA received only 0.02 percent of the votes.Nohlen, D & St√∂ver, P (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p. 899. In the second round, ZA entered into an electoral alliance with the Agrarian Alliance (ASZ), but did not gain any individual seats. In the forthcoming years, the Green Alternative protested against the constructions of Gabƒç√≠kovo‚ÄìNagymaros Dams, a landfill in P√©cel and the operations of the uranium mine in P√©cs, the alumina plant in L√°batlan and the Paks Nuclear Power Plant. In September 1997, it joined the electoral alliance Union for Hungary, dominated by the Republican Party, however they received only 0.19 percent of the votes in the 1998 parliamentary election. The coalition broke up after that. Erzs√©bet Schmuck left the party on 21 June 1998, she was replaced by M√°rta M√°rczis (mother of Benedek J√°vor) as co- president. On 3 June 2000, the ZA merged with the Social Democracy 2000 Foundation to form the Alliance of Green Democrats (ZDSZ). International relations In January 1994, the ZA was admitted into the European Federation of Green Parties, which established under this name few months earlier. Gy√∂rgy Droppa was also elected to the European political party's leadership. In that capacity, Droppa established a good relationship with the GreenLeft, a prominent Dutch member of the federation.

He was a three-time gold medalist at the International Olympiad in Informatics, in 2005, 2006, and 2007.. In 2007, Pardon placed second in the Intel Science Talent Search competition, with a generalization to rectifiable curves of the carpenter's rule problem for polygons. In this project, he showed that every rectifiable Jordan curve in the plane can be continuously deformed into a convex curve without changing its length and without ever allowing any two points of the curve to get closer to each other.Aimee Cunningham, \\"The Next Generation\\", Science News, 17 March 2007, p. 166. He published this research in the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society in 2009. Pardon then went to Princeton University, where after his sophomore year he primarily took graduate-level mathematics classes. At Princeton, Pardon solved a problem in knot theory posed by Mikhail Gromov in 1983 about whether every knot can be embedded into three-dimensional space with bounded stretch factor. Pardon showed that, on the contrary, the stretch factor of certain torus knots could be arbitrarily large. His proof was published in the Annals of Mathematics in 2011, and earned him the Morgan Prize of 2012.Clay Mathematics Institute, \\"Research Fellow: John Pardon\\" (28 January 2015).

The rock's mineralogical composition suggests it is a glacial erratic, and would have been transported from the nearby Alps by slowly moving glaciers.  Localization  Originally, Gros Caillou was located at the end of Boulevard de la Croix-Rousse, constructed in 1865, and the boundary between the 1st arrondissement (Croix- Rousse hill) and the 4th arrondissement (Croix-Rousse plateau). Until it was annexed in 1852, the Croix-Rousse Plateau was a separate city. Thus, the location of Gros Caillou at that intersection became a unifying symbol. At the beginning of the 21st century, an underground parking lot and green area took over this area and Gros Caillou was relocated 30m into the 1st arrondissement.  History  Gros Caillou is a metamorphic Triassic quartzite, typical of the alpine regions of Haute-Maurienne and Haute Tarentaise. It is rock that was displaced by glaciers over 200 km during the Riss glaciation (around 140,000BC).Source : The discovery of Gros Caillou dates back to 1861 during drilling of the tunnels of a funicular linking downtown Lyon to the Croix- Rousse plateau. The drilling had to be interrupted as the workers were blocked by an extremely hard rock, which they could not break.Source : After many attempts and work stoppages, Gros Caillou was eventually excavated, becoming a symbol of not only the annexation of Croix-Rousse, but a symbol of the perseverance of Lyon's inhabitants. Had the funicular not been under construction, Gros Caillou would never have been found and relocated to the east side of Croix-Rousse boulevard, where to this day it overlooks the Rh√¥ne River and the Alps.

With the rise of the tea industry in North America, C.tamala honey has its appeal and potential as a natural sweetener. Cinnamomum tamala in Nepal C.tamala is an indigenous tree species to Nepal, grown between 450‚Äì2100 m elevation.Lamichhane, D., & Karna, N. (2010). Harvesting methods of Cinnamomum tamala leaves in private land: A case study from Udayapur district, Nepal. Banko Banko Janakari, 19(2). Naturally grown in the tropical and subtropical Himalayas, mid-hills district of Nepal. These trees are ideal for cash crop farming because of the essential oils that can be extracted from the leaves. Yields are sufficient due to the longevity of each tree, being able to live and bear leaves up to 100 years, while the leaves can be collected after the first ten. The average annual yield per tree is 40‚Äì100 kg/tree with collections being made from October‚ÄìMarch, providing a long season for the collection of the leaves.Orwa et al. (2009). Cinnamomum tamala. 3-4. Retrieved November 9, 2015. Labour is required to manually collect leaves from the trees. Many farmers prefer hand picking as the use of tools can potentially damage the trees. Tejpat trees on subsistent farms in the villages of Udayapur District range from 10-155 trees per household. Oil Extraction Extraction of oil from the Tejpat leaves has been explored through superheated water extraction (SHWE), providing a potentially environmentally friendly process.Jayawardena, & Smith.

Communities who do not practice traditional beekeeping techniques called ‚Äòhoney hunters‚Äô, collect honey from the nests of wild species. Wild (organic) honey produced by Apis dorsata contains large amounts of enzymes and amino acids, attributing a good price in international markets. Industry opportunities Narrowing in on the Palpa District in the Middle Hills of Nepal, local sale and trade of Tejpat markets sustains the livelihood of many families through contributing to household economy.Pandit, B., Thapa, G., & Zoebisch, M.

Retrieved November 19, 2015, from Exports of Tejpat from the Palpa district to India and neighbouring countries show an increase, proving the potential for income generation for poor and disadvantaged Nepalese farmers. Honey is considered one of the most effective and inexpensive home remedies. Richness of bees and floral resources offer good potential for niche market. Due to lack of education, Nepali farmers are often unable to meet the quality specified by buyers for their honey. Farming bees in Nepal requires minimal start up investment and generally yields profits within the first year of operation. Assurance of quality is key to improving access to international markets. Honey processing in the case of poor farmers requires the simple access to and use of bowls, a sieve or straining cloth, and containers.  Tejpat farming  Lack of education of market opportunities, limited access to transportation, and unfair bartering are some of the many concerns local Nepalese farmers have with the sale of Tejpat. There is economic potential, prompting concern regarding the conservation of this species. In-situ and ex-situ methods of conservation, including gene and seed banks, are beneficial for future opportunities this crop should provide.

G. Springsteen and starring Vaughn Monroe. The film features three songs by Monroe. \\"Mule Train\\", one of the songs featured in this 1950 Republic Western and sung by Vaughn Monroe, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1950, but lost out to \\"Mona Lisa\\" from Captain Carey, U.S.A.. Plot A wanted outlaw named Rhiannon has stashed a million dollars worth of gold stolen from the Great Western Mining Company. The sheriff from the nearby town of Goldville, Jim Caradac, hides inside a stagecoach reported to be carrying more of the company's gold. Rhiannon hold up a stagecoach carrying Caradac and Caradac's girlfriend, Nan Morgan. Caradac attempts to stop the robbery, but Rhiannon quickly disarms him. When he opens the strong box and finds only sand inside, Rhiannon decides to teach the gloating Caradac a lesson. He follows the stage to the edge of town and forces Caradac to walk down the middle of the street dressed in a pair of women's underwear, much to the amusement of the residents. Caradac chases Rhiannon who gets the drop on him and shoots him from a distance. Rhiannon later returns to bury the lawman. Rhiannon approaches the body and rolls Caradac over only to find himself staring down the barrel of a six-shooter. When Caradac tries to convince him to take him to the hidden gold, Rhiannon manages to knock him off balance and shoots him. Rhiannon takes Caradac to Dr. Jonathan Mark, who is also the town preacher. Rhiannon tells the doctor that his name is John Gwyn and that he found Caradac by chance while he was riding. The doctor says that Caradac needs a blood transfusion and the doctor 'convinces' Rhiannon to volunteer to be the donor by drugging him. When he wakes, Rhiannon discovers his gun is missing, and the doctor explains that he drugged him to prevent him from changing his mind about the transfusion. A judge then enters the room to deputize Rhiannon, and he agrees to take up Caradac's duties until he can return to work. Rhiannon agrees so he will have to opportunity to rob a large shipment meant to go out in three weeks. That evening, Rhiannon receives his first call from Nan, who asks for help ejecting a drunken man, Mike Murphy from her saloon. He also confronts the local man who manages the local branch of the mining company, Richards. By Sunday morning, the jail is packed with drunks, so Rhiannon releases them and makes each one promise to attend church or face a $10 fine. When the Great Western Mine catches on fire and several miners are trapped inside, Rhiannon risks his own life to save them, including Mike. Seeing him with his face half covered, Nan recognizes Rhiannon as the outlaw who attacked her stagecoach and decides to report it to Jim, who has since partially recovered. The doctor has known all along and wanted to work on convincing Rhiannon to go straight. Caradac agrees to allow the doctor to continue to try, but says he must get him to give up the gold before the big shipment goes out. Nan also wants to convince him to give up the location of the gold, but only because she wants the $50,000 reward. The doctor confronts Rhiannon about his past and Rhiannon tells him how the Great Western Mining Company had claim-jumped him twice and the law had done nothing about it. Caradac allows Rhiannon to ride out with the gold shipment intent on following Rhiannon to the gold. The doctor follows the stage and gives Rhiannon a prescription to fill when he delivers the gold, Rhiannon has a change of heart and decides not to rob the stage. Caradac arrests him anyway and warns him that he will be charged with stagecoach robbery unless he reveals the location of his hideout and the gold, but Rhiannon refuses to talk. Later, Nan with the aid of Mike helps Rhiannon escape from jail, and by pretending to be romantically interested in him, convinces him to take her to his hideout where he has hidden the stolen gold. Nan pistol whips Rhiannon and flees with the gold. Caradac reveals that he gave Nan the key to the jail cell and she will tell them location of the gold. Two days later, Rhiannon rides back to town and confronts Caradac believing that Caradac set him up with Nan. Caradac, believing Nan has double-crossed him, has spent the last two days in the saloon. Rhiannon and Caradac place their guns on the table and agree to go for them the next time the saloon doors open. Doc beats them both to the guns and gives them a dressing down for their behavior. Richards gets the jump on them and tries to force Rhiannon to give up the location of gold. Caradac and Rhiannon fight together and defeat Richards and his men. Rhiannon surrenders himself, just as Nan and Mike return with a receipt for the gold. Caradac gives Rhiannon his blessing. Doc is glad that Rhiannon has gone straight.

Owned by Louis Freedman and trained by Noel Murless she won seven of her fifteen races and was regarded as the best British filly of her generation at both three and four years of age. She took time to show her best form but in the second half of 1972 she won five consecutive races including the Yorkshire Oaks, Park Hill Stakes and Princess Royal Stakes. In the following year she finished second in the Coronation Cup and the Hardwicke Stakes before stepping up in distance to record decisive wins over male opponents in the Geoffrey Freer Stakes and the Doncaster Cup. She was retired from racing at the end of 1973 and had some influence as a broodmare. Background Attica Meli was a large bay mare with no white markings bred by in Ireland by the Sassoon Stud a breeding organisation founded by Victor Sassoon and later maintained by his widow. She was the penultimate European crop of foals sired by Primera, a stayer whose wins included the Ebor Handicap and the Ormonde Stakes, before he was exported to stand in Japan. He was a representative of the Byerley Turk sire line, unlike more than 95% of modern thoroughbreds, who descend directly from the Darley Arabian. Her dam, Come On Honey made little impact as a racehorse but was a very successful broodmare who also produced the Park Hill Stakes winner Royal Hive and Be Sweet, who finished second in the Ribblesdale Stakes and the Sun Chariot Stakes. Come On Honey was a daughter of Honeylight who won the 1000 Guineas and a half sister to Crepello and Twilight Alley. In 1971 the Sassoon Studs were bought by Louis Freedman. The horses at the Sassoon's Beech House Stud, including the two- year-old Attica Meli, were sent to be trained by Noel Murless. During her racing career the filly was owned by Freedman and trained by Murless Newmarket. She was ridden in all of her major races by Geoff Lewis. Racing career 1971 & 1972: two- and three-year-old seasons On her only appearance as a two-year-old Attica Meli finished fourth in a maiden race over five furlongs. In the early part of 1972, the Murless stable was badly affected by an outbreak of a viral infection delaying the preparation and progress of the horses. Attica Meli ran well on her three-year-old debut when finishing third to Miss Paris in the Fred Darling Stakes over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse in April but then succumbed to the virus and was off the course for three months. In the summer of 1972 she won minor races over ten furlongs and one and a half miles before being moved up in class for the Group One Yorkshire Oaks at York Racecourse in August. Ridden by Geoff Lewis she started at odds of 13/2 and won from Coral Beach, with The Oaks winner Ginevra in third place. In autumn, Attica Meli was moved up in distance to contest the Park Hill Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse on 7 September. She started the 5/4 favourite and won again, beating the Galtres Stakes winner Carrot Top. Later that month, she ended her season by winning the Princess Royal Stakes over one and a half miles at Ascot Racecourse. 1973: four-year-old season Attica Meli was matched against male opposition in all eight of her races in 1973. On her first appearance as a four-year-old, she finished fifth to Ormindo when favourite for the Ormonde Stakes at Chester Racecourse in May. In her next two race, Attica Meli finished second to Roberto in the Coronation Cup at Epsom Downs Racecourse and second to Rheingold in the Hardwicke Stakes at Royal Ascot. In the Princess of Wales's Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in July she sweated heavily and became agitated before the start. In the race she led after half a mile but weakened quickly in the closing stages and finished fourth behind Our Mirage, Ormindo and Ballyhot. Timeform commented that they would not be surprised if she were to be \\"packed off to stud\\". In August Attica Meli started at odds of 9/1 for the Geoffrey Freer Stakes over thirteen and a half furlongs at Newbury Racecourse, when she again faced Our Mirage, Ormindo and Ballyhot. She reportedly looked much more impressive in the paddock than she had done in her previous races that year. Lewis settled the filly in second place behind the pacemaker Bright Beam before taking the lead three furlongs out. She drew clear of her rivals in the last quarter mile and won by six lengths from Ballyhot with the six-year-old Petty Officer in third place. It was announced after the race that Attica Meli would be aimed at the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, but in her next race she was moved up in distance for the Doncaster Cup over two and a quarter miles in September. She started the 4/11 favourite against three opponents headed by the three-year-old Goodwood Cup winner, Proverb. She took the lead two furlongs from the finish and won very easily by four lengths from the four-year-old Bretton Woods with Proverb in third. At Longchamp Racecourse on 7 October, Attica Meli started at odds of 22/1 in a 27-runner field for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe over 2400 metres. She looked unimpressive in the paddock and had to be pushed along to reach a position just behind the leaders on the wide outside approaching the straight. She could make no further progress and tired badly in the closing stages to finish in 22nd place behind Rheingold. On her final racecourse appearance Attica Meli contested the St Simon Stakes at Newbury. She took the lead three furlongs out but was overtaken in the closing stages and beaten three lengths into second by the 20/1 outsider Ballyhot. Assessment In 1972, the independent Timeform organisation gave Attica Meli a rating of 125, eight pounds below their top-rated three-year-old filly Pistol Packer. In the British Free Handicap for three-year-olds, Attica Meli was the top-rated filly of 1972, two pounds below The Derby winner Roberto. In 1973 Timeform gain gave her a rating of 125, making her their highest-rated older female racehorse of the year. Breeding record Attica Meli was retired from racing to become a broodmare. She produced at least seven foals and two winners between 1975 and 1988: *Daidis, a bay filly, foaled in 1975, sired by Welsh Pageant. Failed to win in six races. *Marathon Gold, bay, 1977, by Derring-Do. Won two races including the Lanson Champagne Stakes. *Honeybeta, bay filly, 1980, by Habitat. Won three races, third in the Princess Royal Stakes. Grand-dam of Alberto Giacometti (Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud). *Impossibility, bay filly, 1982, by Posse. Failed to win in two races. *In Clover, bay filly, 1984, by Habitat. Failed to win in two races. *Honey Reef, bay filly, 1986, by Mill Reef. Failed to win in three races. *Sweet Request, bay colt (later gelded), 1988, by Rainbow Quest. Failed to win in eighteen races.

He was a principal organizer of the Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics. Biography Born in Liverpool, October 7, 1923, \\"into a comfortable Jewish middle-class family\\",Wolfgang Rindler & Andrzej Trautman, Gravitation and geometry: a volume in honour of Ivor Robinson, Bibliopolis (1987), p. 9 Ivor Robinson studied at Cambridge University, where he was influenced by the mathematician Abram Samoilovitch Besicovitch. He took his B.A. in Mathematics in 1947. His first academic placements were at University College of Wales, King's College London, University of North Carolina, University of Hamburg, Syracuse University and Cornell University. Alfred Schild was developing a department strong in relativity at Austin, Texas, when a second Texas center for relativity research was proposed. Lloyd Berkner was directing the Southwest Center for Advanced Studies at Dallas and brought Ivor Robinson there in 1963 when it was a \\"windowless cube on the Southern Methodist University campus\\". Robinson was head of the Mathematics and Mathematical Physics division. This institution became the University of Texas at Dallas. \\"Ivor was charged with the formation of a mathematical physics group concentrating on general relativity and cosmology.\\" He brought Istvan Ozsv√°th and Wolfgang Rindler to Dallas. According to Rindler, \\"No one who knew him will forget what a brilliant conversationalist he was, with his sonorous deep voice and ultra-English accent, with his convictions and occasional mischievousness.\\" \\"Ivor Robinson is a brilliant mathematician who showed us the elegant simplicity of space- time by pointing to its null structure.\\" Robinson retired in 2000, remaining Professor Emeritus in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Texas at Dallas. Contributions Ivor Robinson contributed extensively to modern developments in the theory of relativity. He is known for his pioneering work on null electromagnetic fields, for his collaboration with Andrzej Trautman on models for spherical gravitational waves, and for the Bel‚ÄìRobinson tensor. Roger Penrose has credited him as an important influence in the development of twistor theory, through his construction of the so- called Robinson congruences. Symposium series Astrophysical sciences developed with attention to spectra of celestial sources to ascertain the chemical origin of these sources. The addition of radio astronomy extended the range of these spectra and revealed quasi-stellar sources with peculiar spectra. Maarten Schmidt and Jesse Greenstein found extreme red shifts in their studies, which demanded an explanation. Relativistic astrophysics offered its services as a generator of models such as black holes and their environs. Robinson, Sch√ºcking, and others organized the first Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics for December, 1963, in Dallas.Engelbert Schucking (August 1989) The First Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics Physics Today The Proceedings were published by University of Chicago Press as Quasi- stellar Sources and Gravitational Collapse. \\"It is now conventional wisdom that quasars are probably powered by rotating black holes, but it was here at Dallas that the black hole concept emerged as a serious astronomical hypothesis.\\" The following year, a second Symposium, had Quasars and High- energy Astronomy as its published proceedings. The series continued with Symposia in alternate years. The sixth Symposium, held in New York in 1972, had its proceedings published by the New York Academy of Sciences. The following volumes of the Annals of the Academy are proceedings of the Symposium series: 224, 264, 302, 336, 375, 422, 470, 571, 647, 688, and 759. In 1974 the Symposium was back in Dallas, but then it travelled: Boston, Munich (twice), Baltimore, Austin (twice), Jerusalem, Chicago, Brighton, Berkeley, Paris, Stanford, and many subsequent venues. From the point of view of astrophysics, a rotating black hole corresponds to a Kerr metric. The astronomical picture of a quasar involves an active galactic nucleus with a supermassive black hole.

Named after a tannery owned by one of the city's founders, it begins in what is now the Sylvan‚ÄìHighlands neighborhood in the Tualatin Mountains (West Hills) west of downtown. In the 19th century the creek flowed on the surface, running northeast across the city, past what later became Providence Park and into a shallow lake (Couch Lake) and wetlands in what became the Pearl District, bordering the river. Late in the century, the city began re-routing Tanner Creek and other West Hills streams into combined sewers and filling their former channels and basins to make flat land for homes and businesses. In the 21st century, Tanner Creek is nearly invisible, flowing through a conduit (but not a combined sewer) that empties into the Willamette at Outfall 11, near the Broadway Bridge. Structures along the former course of the creek include Vista Bridge and Tanner Springs Park as well as Providence Park. Names Daniel Lownsdale, an early Portland settler and one of Portland's founders, built a tannery along the creek in 1845. The creek was named for the tannery. Canyon Road, important to Portland's early development, was built along Tanner Creek canyon. First opened in 1849, the road connected Portland to the Tualatin Valley. Lownsdale was the surveyor on an improved version, a plank road, two years later, which began near the future site of the Portland Art Museum. Couch Lake was named for John H. Couch, another early settler and one of the city's founders. Couch built a home on the west side of the lake. On the surface The creek's headwaters lie in what is now the Sylvan‚ÄìHighlands neighborhood in the Tualatin Mountains (West Hills) west of downtown. The creek flowed down the canyon that now accommodates Southwest Jefferson Street and Canyon Road (U.S. Highway 26). Its course continued across the site of the later Civic Stadium (Providence Park) and down a ravine. The ravine or gulch was up to deep in places and as wide in places as several city blocks. Vista Bridge in the Goose Hollow neighborhood crosses a remnant of the Tanner Creek gulch. Pavement markers near Providence Park indicate the creek's former course in that vicinity. The creek emptied into Couch Lake, near today's Union Station. The lake, which no longer exists, was up to deep and covered 22 city blocks. In 1888, after the Northern Pacific Terminal Company bought the lake, it began filling it with sand and ship ballast. Underground Between 1887 and 1891, the City of Portland built a Tanner Creek combined sewer to carry the creek as well as storm runoff and sewage from the West Hills and its homes to the river. Constructed in three stages, the sewer, about in diameter, was at that time \\"one of the largest trunk sewers ever built by the city.\\" In 1904, the sewer collapsed near the Multnomah Athletic Club and flooded property downhill. Investigation of the subsequent sewer reconstruction and repair led to a scandal during the administration of Mayor George Henry Williams and to the firing of the city engineer and chief deputy city engineer on grounds \\"that they had a part in a general conspiracy to slight the work.\\" The Tanner Creek trunk sewer ran from Southwest Taylor Street to the river near the intersection of Front Avenue and Pettygrove Street. 21st century Tanner Springs Park, at Northwest 10th Avenue and Marshall Street, commemorates the creek. Opened on land acquired in 2003, it is an \\"urban waterscape\\" built on fill that rises higher than the former lake surface. The wetlands in the park are not connected to Tanner Creek but depend mostly on recycled rainwater. In 2006, the city completed a pipeline that removed Tanner Creek from the combined sewer system and carried the creek water directly into the Willamette. This was part of a much larger project designed to keep sewage from entering the river during storms. The outfall into the river is about a quarter-mile downstream of the Broadway Bridge and upstream of the Willamette's confluence with the Columbia River See also *List of rivers of Oregon * West Side CSO Tunnel References Works cited * Geography of Portland, Oregon Rivers of Multnomah County, Oregon Rivers of Oregon Tributaries of the Willamette River ","title":"Tanner Creek"},{"id":"48651935","text":"Gliese 3470 b, abbreviated as GJ3470b, is an exoplanet orbiting the star Gliese 3470, both of which are located in the constellation Cancer. With a mass of just under 14 Earth-masses and a radius approximately 4.3 times that of Earth's, it is likely something akin to a mini-Neptune despite the initially strong belief that the planet was not covered in clouds like the gas giants we are familiar with in our solar system. The planet belongs to the rare category of super-puffs. Atmosphere The Gliese 3470 b being the one of the first discovered super-puffs, the planetary atmosphere is one of the best specroscopically characterized among all exoplanets. The exoplanet's atmosphere was first observed by researchers Akihiko Fukui, Norio Narita and Kenji Kuroda at the University of Tokyo in 2013, and afterwards, Fukui commented, \\"Suppose the atmosphere consists of hydrogen and helium, the mass of the atmosphere would be 5‚Äì20% of the total mass of the planet. Comparing that to the fact that the mass of Earth's atmosphere is about one ten- thousandth of a percent (0.0001%) of the total mass of the Earth, this planet has a considerably thick atmosphere.\\" In 2013, by means of Large Binocular Telescope observations, with the LBC Blue and Red cameras, a team reported the detection of Rayleigh scattering in the atmosphere of this planet. Lately, in 2015 a team using the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope (LCOGT) network confirmed this finding. In the Las Cumbres researchers' paper published in The Astrophysical Journal, they conclude that the most plausible explanation for the scattering effect to be an atmosphere made predominantly of hydrogen and helium, causing the exoplanet to be veiled by dense clouds and hazes. It is thought that the planet would appear blue to the human eye due to this scattering. In 2017-2019, the primary hydrogen atmosphere with overall low metallicity, depleted methane and traces of water was characterized. It is likely filling an entire Roche lobe of the planet. In 2019 and 2020, a singly ionized helium outflow was detected in the atmosphere of Gliese 3470 b, indicating the atmosphere is currently escaping at rate 30,000-100,000 tons per second, or 0.16-0.53 Earth masses per billion years.

History It was established by the merger of Green Alternative (ZA), Social Democracy 2000 Foundation (SD2000) and the Social Democrat Youth Movement (SZIM) on 3 June 2000. Gy√∂rgy Droppa (ZA) and Istv√°n Podkoniczky (SD2000) were elected co-presidents, several leaving members of the Hungarian Social Democratic Party (MSZDP) had joined the newly established organization. In autumn 2001, the entrepreneur faction of the party led by K√°roly Garabits were entirely expelled from the party by a court decision after internal party conflicts. ZDSZ joined the Centre Party for the 2002 parliamentary election, but did not gain any seats.Nohlen, D & St√∂ver, P (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p. 899. In the 2002 local elections, Droppa was the Centre's candidate for the position of Mayor of Budapest, but received only 0.59 percent of the votes and came to the fifth place. On 16 November 2003, the Green Democrats transformed itself into a party alliance by merging the Social Democratic Party of Environmentalists (KSZDP), the Party of Hungarian Women (MNP), the Hungarian Social Green Party (MSZZP), the Alliance of Greens (ZSZ) and the New Left Party (√öBP). The V√©degylet, the Clean Air Action Group and several other environmentalist NGOs rejected the integration efforts of ZDSZ. On 31 December 2004, the ZDSZ left the Centre Party. Just before the 2006 parliamentary election, several rural organizations of the party left ZDSZ to establish the Party of Greens. As a result, only one candidate run under ZDSZ banner. On 28 March 2009, ZDSZ, along with European Feminist Initiative for a Different Europe and Workers' Party of Hungary 2006, merged into the Green Left, in a reaction to the foundation of the Politics Can Be Different (LMP). Before that the ZDSZ rejected the cooperation with the LMP civilian initiative.

Metzger defines them as the way people \\"use their body, head, and eye gaze to report the actions, thoughts, words, and expressions of characters within a discourse\\".Metzger 1995, p. 256, cited in Braga and Talbot 2009 Constructed action is when a speaker performs the actions of someone else in the narrative, while constructed dialogue is when a speaker acts as the other person in a reported dialogue. The difference between constructed action and constructed dialogue in sign language users is an important distinction to make, since signing can be considered an action. Recounting a past dialogue through sign is the communication of that occurrence so therefore it is part of the dialogue whereas the facial expressions and depictions of actions that took place are constructed actions. Constructed action is very common cross-linguistically. Constructed action Constructed action is common in many languages when telling stories or reporting the actions of others. During a narrative, the speaker not only reports the actions of others but performs them as well. The actions performed are not the exact actions of the person but an action constructed by the speaker. Liddell gives the example of a speaker patting their pockets when talking about someone having lost their keys. Since the speaker has not lost their own keys, the only reason they would pat their pockets would be to illustrate the story they are telling. The addressee then understands these actions not as the speaker's but of a character within the story. In sign languages across the world constructed action is used in a similar way, but is limited in the sense that communication must be continued with the individual's hands. Those who use sign language will still have their hands telling the story, but the rest of their body and face will be expressing the actions of another individual in the story. Often the constructed action is said to start with a break in eye contact and then the shifting of the signer's body. The constructed action in sign language also adds more information to the story being told in the sense that the words being signed will give a part of the story while the rest of the body and face will tell a reaction or some other component about the individual the story is about. Due to the added meaning from these bodily movements, constructed action is described as symbolic in sign language. Those who have learned American Sign Language show similar physical motions when using constructed action despite the differences in their education, as well as constructed action not being taught as a standard component in the sign language. Signers do not always define their extra body motions as constructed action, but the similarities to the term's definition as well as the function of the movements connects the two ideas together. The constructed actions are able to convey information in a faster and more efficient way than if they were to be signed out, and are useful for faster relay in information. Because of this, constructed action is seen as a way to overcome the impairment that deaf individuals face and simply streamlines their communication much like people attempt to in spoken language. Constructed dialogue Constructed dialogue is when a speaker assumes the role of a character in the discourse. It often includes role- shifting, directed gaze, and body movement. For example, in American Sign Language, a speaker may utilize constructed dialogue by shifting their body to denote different characters and directing their gaze to particular points. The signs produced are then understood as the signing of the character, not of the speaker themselves. Constructed dialogue is used in storytelling, when a speaker recounts the words of another to an audience. Speakers will signal that they are retelling \\"by changing head and body orientation, as well as gaze direction.\\" Verbal cues like \\"I said,\\" \\"I was like,\\" and \\"he goes,\\" are also used to signal that the speaker is retelling an occurrence. Stories are constructed dialogue by themselves, because there is still the act of retelling the story which means it will be altered to some degree by the story teller. Constructed dialogue is also common in gossip, and is often begun with words such as : \\"Oh\\" \\"Like\\" and \\"Uh\\". While used in gossip, constructed dialogue influences how others will interpret the third-party being referenced. Because of this, how someone uses constructed dialogue can cause an array of effects to the third-party. For example, the third-party group may be avoided from that point on, or they may even be interacted with more. Constructed dialogue does can be used positively, negatively or anywhere in between.

It is made with a welded 3/16\\" steel hull in the clinker configuration and a cabin made of 18 gauge steel. It has a cable steering system with a plate steel rudder, 26\\" diameter Propeller with a rather heavy duty shield around the prop made of round bar to shop logs and debris from damaging the propeller, English made Lister model FR4 4 cylinder water-cooled diesel engine producing 36 hp at 1,800 rpm and a Twin Disc model MG-61 reversing marine gearbox with a 3:1 gear ratio. This boat also originally had a Russel-Hipweel winch, model W-434 that was driven by a PTO on the front of the engine but it has since been removed. The standard models have a simple rectangle cabin with a large sliding windows on both the port and starboard sides, a smaller sliding window and a door that opens to the inside on the front, and a little sliding door on the back of the cabin. They usually have the exhaust pipe going out through the side of the hull approximately a foot below the bulwarks on an angle facing aft, but many have had the pipe removed and installed going up through the roof of the cabin. There is a cable sheave on each side of the boat by the corners of the cabin up forward on the edge of the bulwarks, 2 at the bow on the inside of the bulwarks, and one larger one right on the bow of the boats, all for the cable to roll on while using the winch. The boats usually also have the hull number on the bow under the larger roller. There is a cleat welded on the inside of the bulwarks on each side up foreword for tying the boat to a dock, and the double bitt on the stern just aft of the cabin for hooking up log booms and tying the boat up as well. The winches on these boats usually carried between 1500‚Äì2000 feet of 7/16 steel cable. More history and info about these types of boats Propeller guard This vessel has a closed circuit cooling system, with a sealed tank built on the starboard (right) side of the hull which holds approximately 40-50 litres of water. This system was used as these boats would be used for bundling up logs in shallow water, and can also portage themselves over land using their own winch, so to keep the engines cooled they had to have their own cooling system on board that wouldn't \\"run dry\\". The boats were built to be operated by one person standing inside on the port side beside the engine, the steering wheel was mounted on a frame along the side so the person can operate the throttle for the engine, the lever for shifting the gearbox, and the lever for operating the winch all on their right side, and steer the boat by turning the wheel with their left hand. These boats had a 175lb anchor on the bow hooked up the cable on the winch, when these boats were used for logging, they would go a distance ahead of the log boom, drop the anchor and pay out the winch while backing up to the log boom, hook up the boom to a set of double bitts (H-bitt) at the stern of the boat (just aft of the cabin) and haul the logs foreword using the propeller and by engaging the winch to pull them along. The way these vessels were made if fantastic, they are small and light, but has much torque for pulling. There were hundreds of these little boats built by the Russel Brothers company and many can be found scattered all across Canada, and a few, in the United States. This series of winch boat was made usually in sizes ranging from 20 feet long to about 30 feet long, and had an option of a few different engines including Russel Gas engines (originally Campbell Gasoline Engines but in 1923 Russel Brothers purchased rights to manufacture the engines), Sheppard Diesel Engines, and later Lister Diesel engine. Over the years many boats have been re powered by their owners with other engine including Perkins, Detroit Diesel, Caterpillar, and other diesel engines. They usually had two fuel tanks, one under the deck in the bow, and one under the stern deck just behind the engine, the one that is on my boat appears to be approximately 120-litre tank, and it is a heavy wall steel drum type tank. Over the years since the log drives have stopped, many of these boats have been converted into pleasure boats and general small tugboat, usually with new or modified cabins installed.

October 24, 1995 The Russian Presidency of Boris Yeltsin, was the executive branch of the federal government of the Russian Federation from June 12, 1991 to December 31, 1999. Yeltsin was the first Russian president, and during his presidency, the country suffered from widespread corruption. As a result of persistent low oil and commodity prices during the 1990s, Russia suffered inflation, economic collapse and enormous political and social problems that affected Russia and the other former states of the USSR. Within a few years of his presidency, many of Yeltsin's initial supporters started to criticize his leadership, and Vice President Alexander Rutskoy even denounced the reforms as \\"economic genocide\\". Ongoing confrontations with the Supreme Soviet climaxed in the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis in which Yeltsin illegally ordered the dissolution of the Supreme Soviet parliament, which as a result decided to try to remove him from office. In October 1993, troops loyal to Yeltsin stopped an armed uprising outside of the parliament building, leading to a number of deaths. Yeltsin then scrapped the existing Russian constitution, banned political opposition and deepened his efforts to transform the economy. On December 31, 1999, under enormous internal pressure, Yeltsin announced his resignation, leaving the presidency in the hands of his chosen successor, then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. Yeltsin left office widely unpopular with the Russian population. The election and inauguration On June 12, 1991 Yeltsin was elected as the first President of the Russian Federation, received 45,552,041 votes, representing 57.30 percent of the number who took part in the vote, and well ahead of Nikolai Ryzhkov, who, despite the support of the federal authorities, received only 16.85%. Together with Boris Yeltsin was elected a vice-president, Alexander Rutskoi. After the elections, Boris Yeltsin began the struggle with the privileges of the range and the maintenance of Russia's sovereignty within the USSR. These were the first in the history of Russian national presidential elections. On July 10, 1991 Boris Yeltsin brought an oath of allegiance to the people of Russia and the Russian Constitution and assumed the position of President of the Russian Federation. After taking the oath, he made a keynote speech, which began energetically and emotionally, understanding the solemnity of the time. The first decree, which was signed by Yeltsin, was the decree \\"On urgent measures for the development of education in the Russian Federation.\\" The document, prepared with the active participation of the Ministry of Education of the RSFSR, headed by ED Dnieper, outlined a number of measures to support, financially, the system of education, which were explicit declarative. Much of the declared in the decree have not been fulfilled, for example, promise to \\"send abroad each year for training, internships, training not less than 10 thousand students, post- graduate students, teachers and academic staff\\". On July 20, 1991 Boris Yeltsin signed a decree No. 14 \\"On the termination of activity of organizational structures of political parties and mass social movements in state bodies, institutions and organizations of the Russian Federation\\", which has become one of the final chords policy of partization and dedeologization. Yeltsin began to negotiate the signing of a new union treaty with Mikhail Gorbachev and the leaders of other Soviet republics. First term State Committee on the State of Emergency On August 19, 1991, after the announcement of the creation of the State Committee on the State of Emergency and the isolation of Gorbachev in the Crimea, Yeltsin led the resistance to the Emergency Committee and made the Russian House of Soviets (\\"The White House\\") as the center of resistance. On the first day of events Yeltsin, speaking from a tank outside the White House, called the actions of the State Emergency Committee a coup, then issued a number of decrees on non-recognition of the State Emergency Committee action. On August 23 Yeltsin signed a decree suspending the activities of the RSFSR, and on November 6, on the termination of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. After the failure of the Emergency Committee, and Gorbachev has returned to Moscow to negotiate a new Union Treaty are deadlocked, and Gorbachev finally began to lose control levers, which are gradually retreating to Yeltsin and heads of other union republics. Dissolution of the Soviet Union In December 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Soviet President Gorbachev held a secret meeting with Ukrainian President, Leonid Kravchuk, and Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Belarus, Stanislav Shushkevich, which led to negotiations on the establishment of the Commonwealth of Independent States. On December 8, 1991, the presidents of Ukraine, Russia and the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Belarus signed the Belavezha Agreement on creation of the CIS, which states that \\"the USSR, as a subject of international law and a geopolitical reality ceased to exist\\". The agreement was signed despite the referendum on preserving the Soviet Union, which took place March 17, 1991. On December 12, the agreement was ratified by the Supreme Soviet of Russia. The Russian parliament ratified the document by a large majority: 188 votes \\"for\\" with 6 votes \\"against\\", and 7 votes were \\"abstained\\". The legitimacy of the ratification caused doubts among some members of the Russian parliament, since according to the Constitution (Fundamental Law) of the RSFSR in 1978 consideration of the documents are in the exclusive jurisdiction of the Congress of People's Deputies, as it affects the character of the Republic as part of USSR and thus entailed changes in the Russian constitution. On December 21 the majority of the union republics joined to the Commonwealth after they signed the Alma-Ata Declarations and the Protocol to the Agreement on the establishment of the CIS. Alexander Lukashenko believes that the most negative consequence of the collapse of the USSR was the formation of a unipolar world. According to Stanislav Shushkevich in 1996, Yeltsin said that he regretted signing the Bialowieza agreements. On December 24, the President of the Russian Federation informed the Secretary General of the United Nations that the membership of the Soviet Union replacing by the Russian Federation which continues the membership in all organs of the United Nations (including membership in the UN Security Council). Thus, Russia is considered an original member of the United Nations (since October 24, 1945), along with Ukraine (SSR) and Belarus (Byelorussian SSR). On December 25, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, was full of presidential power in Russia in connection with the resignation of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and the actual collapse of the USSR. Following the resignation of Mikhail Gorbachev, Boris Yeltsin had transferred his residence from the Russia's White House to the Kremlin and he received the so-called nuclear suitcase. In April 1992, 4th Congress of People's Deputies three times refused to ratify Belovezhskoe agreement and deleted from the text of the Russian Constitution mention of the constitution and laws of the USSR, which subsequently became one of the causes of the confrontation of the Congress of People's Deputies with President Yeltsin and later led to the dispersal of the Congress in October 1993. The USSR Constitution and laws of the USSR continued to be referred to in articles 4, 102 and 147 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation ‚Äì Russian (RSFSR) in 1978 up to December 25, 1993, when in force adopted by a referendum the Constitution of the Russian Federation, which contained no mention of the Constitution and laws of the USSR. In September 1992, a group of People's Deputies, headed by Sergei Baburin sent to the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation a petition to examine the constitutionality of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR of December 12, 1991 \\"On ratification of the Agreement establishing the Commonwealth of Independent States\\". Russian constitutional crisis On December 10, 1992, the day after the Congress of People's Deputies did not approve the candidacy of Yegor Gaidar as Prime Minister, Boris Yeltsin issued a sharp criticism of the Congress of People's Deputies and tried to disrupt their work, calling on his supporters to leave the meeting hall. A political crisis began. After the talks, Boris Yeltsin and Ruslan Khasbulatov, Valery Zorkin and multi-voting, the Congress of People's Deputies on December 12 adopted a resolution on the stabilization of the constitutional system and Viktor Chernomyrdin was appointed as Prime Minister. After the eighth Congress of People's Deputies, which quashed the decision of the stabilization of the constitutional system and the decisions that undermine the independence of the government and the Central Bank, on March 20, 1993, Boris Yeltsin, delivered a televised address to the nation, he announced that it has signed a decree on the introduction of \\"special operation mode\\". The next day, the Supreme Council appealed to the Constitutional Court, calling Yeltsin's appeal \\"an attack on the constitutional foundations of the Russian state\\". The Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, still not having signed the decree, and Yeltsin found the actions associated with the televised address, unconstitutional, and found that the reasons for his dismissal. The Supreme Council convened IX (Extraordinary) Congress of People's Deputies. However, as it turned out after a few days, in fact, it signed another decree contains no gross violations of the Constitution. On March 28, the Congress attempted to remove Yeltsin from his office as president. Speaking at a rally on Vasilyevsky Spusk, Yeltsin vowed not to implement the decision of the Congress if it will still be accepted. However, over the impeachment only 617 deputies has voted out of 1033, with the necessary 689 majority votes. The next day, after failing impeachment Congress of People's Deputies appointed April 25, All-Russian referendum on four issues: the confidence to President Yeltsin, on the approval of its socio-economic policies of the early presidential elections and early elections of people's deputies. Boris Yeltsin called on his supporters to vote \\"yes four\\" themselves supporters were inclined to vote \\"yes-no-yes.\\" According to the results of the referendum of confidence he received 58.7% of votes, while 53.0% voted in favor of the economic reforms. On the issue of early presidential elections and people's deputies \\"for\\" votes, respectively, 49.5% and 67.2% took part in the vote, however, legally significant decisions on these matters have been adopted (as, according to the laws in force, for this \\" for \\"we had to speak out more than half of all eligible voters). Contradictory results of the referendum were interpreted by Yeltsin and his entourage in their favor. After the referendum, Yeltsin focused its efforts on the development and adoption of the new Constitution. On April 30 in the newspaper \\"Izvestia\\" was published on the presidential draft constitution on 18 May, it was announced the launch of the Constitutional Council, and on June 5 Constitutional Assembly gathered for the first meeting in Moscow. After the referendum, Yeltsin virtually ceased all business contacts with the leadership of the Supreme Council, although some continued to sign some time taken them laws, and has lost confidence in the Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi and freed him from all offices, and on September 1 he was suspended from office on suspicion of corruption. Press Freedom in Russia After the fall of the Communist Party and the collapse of the USSR, in the initial period (1991‚Äì1993), The presidency of Boris Yeltsin, the level of freedom in the media has remained at the level of 1990‚Äì1991. First Chechen War Officially, the conflict is defined as \\"measures to maintain constitutional order,\\" the military action called \\"first Chechen war\\", less \\"Russian-Chechen\\" or \\"Russian-Caucasian war\\". The conflict and the events preceding it were characterized by a large number of casualties, the military and law enforcement agencies, noted the facts of ethnic cleansing of non-Chechen population in Chechnya. Although certain military successes of the Russian Interior Ministry and the Russian Armed Forces, the outcome of this conflict was the withdrawal of Russian troops, the massive destruction and casualties, the de facto independence of Chechnya before the second Chechen war and a wave of terror that swept across Russia. With the beginning of perestroika in the various republics of the Soviet Union, including in the Chechen-Ingush Republic stepped various nationalist movements. One of these organizations was the established in 1990 National Congress of the Chechen People (NCCP), aims to exit Chechnya from the Soviet Union and the creation of an independent Chechen state. It was headed by a former general of the Soviet Air Force, Dzhokhar Dudayev. On June 8, 1991 at the II session of the NCCP, Dudayev proclaimed the independence of the Chechen Republic Nokhchi-cho. Thus, the country has developed a dual power. During the \\"August Putsch\\" in Moscow, the leadership of the Chechen Republic supported the Emergency Committee. In response to the events from September 6, 1991 Dudayev declared the dissolution of the national government agencies, accusing Russia of \\"colonial\\" policy. On the same day Dudaev Guardsmen storm seized the building of the Supreme Council, the television station and Radio House. More than 40 deputies were beaten, and the chairman of the Grozny city council Vitali Kutsenko thrown out the window, as a result he died. The Chairman of the RSFSR Supreme Soviet, Ruslan Khasbulatov, then sent them a telegram: \\"I am pleased to have learned of the resignation of the Armed Forces of the Republic.\\" After the collapse of the Soviet state, Dzhokhar Dudayev declared the final outlet of Chechnya from the Russian Federation. On October 27, 1991 in the country under the control of separatists held presidential and parliamentary elections. President of the Republic became Dzhokhar Dudayev. These elections have been declared illegal by the Russian Federation's officials. On November 7, 1991, Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree \\"On the state of emergency in the Chechen-Ingush Republic (1991)\\". The situation in the country has deteriorated ‚Äì the supporters of separatists surrounded the building of the Interior Ministry and the KGB, military camps, blocked rail and air hub. In the end, the introduction of state of emergency was thwarted, the decree \\"On state of emergency in the Chechen-Ingush Republic (1991)\\" was canceled on November 11, three days after its signing, after a heated discussion at the session of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR and Republic began the withdrawal of Russian military forces and units of the Interior Ministry finalized by the summer of 1992. Separatists start capturing and looting of military depots. Dudayev's forces got a lot of weapons. In June 1992, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev ordered to transfer half of Dudayev in existence in the country of weapons and ammunition. According to him, it was a necessary step, since a significant part of the \\"transmission\\" of weapons have been seized, and take the rest there was no way due to the lack of soldiers and trains. Even then, when Dudayev stopped paying taxes to the Russian budget and prohibited employees from entering the Russian special services in the republic, the federal government is officially continued to transfer money to Dudayev. In 1993, the Kaliningrad region has been allocated 140 million rubles to 10.5 billion rubles to Chechnya. Russian oil until 1994 continued to arrive in Chechnya. Dudayev did not pay for it, and resold abroad. Dudayev also got a lot of weapons: 2 rocket launchers ground troops, 42 tanks, 34 infantry fighting vehicles, 14 armored personnel carriers, 14 light armored tractor, 260 aircraft, 57 of thousands of small appliances and many other weapons. On November 30, 1994 Boris Yeltsin decided to send troops to Chechnya and signed a secret decree ‚Ññ 2137 \\"On measures to restore constitutional law and order in the Chechen Republic,\\" and the Chechen conflict began. On December 11, 1994 on the basis of Yeltsin's decree \\"On measures to curb the activities of illegal armed groups on the territory of the Chechen Republic and in the zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict\\" began sending troops to Chechnya. Many ill- considered actions have led to heavy casualties among both military and civilian populations: tens of thousands of people were killed and hundreds of thousands were injured. It often happens that during a military operation, or shortly before it came from Moscow ordered the rebound. This allowed the Chechen rebels to regroup. The first storm of Grozny was ill-conceived and led to heavy casualties: dead and missing over 1,500 people, 100 were captured Russian soldiers. In June 1995, during the seizure of militias under the leadership of Shamil Basayev, hospitals and maternity hospital in Budennovsk, Yeltsin was in Canada, and decided not to stop the trip, providing an opportunity to Chernomyrdin to resolve the situation and negotiate with the militants, he returned only after all events, dismissed the heads of a number of law enforcement agencies and the Governor of the Stavropol Territory. In August 1996, Chechen rebels drove the Federal troops from Grozny. After that Yeltsin signed the Khasavyurt agreements, which many regarded as treacherous. Russian presidential election, 1996 The Presidential elections were held in Russia on June 16, 1996, with a second round on July 3. The result was a victory for the incumbent President Boris Yeltsin, who ran as an independent candidate. Yeltsin defeated the Communist challenger Gennady Zyuganov in the run-off, receiving 54.4% of the vote. His inauguration ceremony took place on August 9. There have been claims that the election was fraudulent, favoring Yeltsin. Second term After the elections, Yeltsin was not seen in public due to his ill health for some time and did not appear before the voters. He appeared in public only at the inauguration ceremony on August 9 that took place in a highly abbreviated procedure because of Yeltsin's poor state of health. On November 5, 1996 Yeltsin underwent surgery coronary artery bypass surgery of the heart, during which Viktor Chernomyrdin has performed the duties of President. Boris Yeltsin did not return to work until the beginning of 1997. In 1997, Boris Yeltsin signed a decree on the ruble denomination, held talks in Moscow with Aslan Maskhadov and signed an agreement on the basic principles of the world, and the relationship with the Chechen Republic. In March 1998, the Government announced the resignation of Chernomyrdin, and on the third attempt, under threat of dissolution of the State Duma, held candidacy Sergei Kirienko. After the economic crisis of August 1998 when, two days after Yeltsin's emphatic statement on television that the devaluation of the ruble would not be devalued and the ruble was devalued by 4 times, he sacked Kiriyenko government and offered to return Chernomyrdin. August 21, 1998 at a meeting of the State Duma of the majority of MPs (248 out of 450) have called Yeltsin to resign voluntarily, in his support were only 32 deputies. In September 1998, with the consent of the State Duma Boris Yeltsin appointed Yevgeny Primakov to the post of prime minister. In May 1999, the State Duma tried unsuccessfully to raise the issue of impeachment of Yeltsin from office (five charges formulated by the initiators of the impeachment, mainly related to Yeltsin's actions during the first term). Before the vote to impeach Yeltsin dismissed Primakov government, and then with the consent of the State Duma appointed Sergei Stepashin, Chairman of the Government, but in August dismissed and submitting for approval of the candidacy of Vladimir Putin, a little-known at the time, and declared him his successor. After the aggravation of the situation in Chechnya, the attack on Dagestan, apartment bombings in Moscow, Buynaksk and Volgodonsk Boris Yeltsin at the suggestion of Vladimir Putin has decided to conduct a series of Chechen counter-terrorist operations. Putin's popularity has increased, and at the end of 1999, Yeltsin decided to resign, leaving Putin as acting president. Resignation On December 31, 1999 at 12 am Moscow time (which was repeated on the main channels for a few minutes before midnight, before the televised New Year) Boris Yeltsin announced his resignation as President of the Russian Federation: \\"Dear friends! My dear! Today is the last time I address you with New Year's greetings. But that's not all. Today, the last time I address you as the President of Russia. I made the decision. Slowly and painfully pondered over it. Today, the last day of the outgoing century, I am resigning.\\" Yeltsin said that he was leaving not for health reasons, but on the totality of the problems, and apologized to the citizens of Russia. Acting President was appointed Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who immediately after the statement of Boris Yeltsin about his own resignation sent a New Year message to the citizens of Russia. Vladimir Putin on the same day signed a decree guaranteeing Yeltsin protection from prosecution, as well as significant financial benefits to him and his family. Dear friends! My dear! Today is the last time I address you with New Year's greetings. But that's not all. Today, the last time I address you as the President of Russia. I made the decision.

It is located along the northern side of the intersection of Pearl Street and the Church Street Marketplace. The building is a contributing property of the \\"Head of Church Street\\" Historic District, in combination with the Masonic Temple (built in 1897) and the Richardson Building. The historic district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 15, 1974.City of Burlington, Vermont: Department of Planning & Zoning - Properties & Districts listed on the National Register, November 2011. http://www.burlingtonvt.gov/PZ/National-Register-of-Historic-Places The Unitarian Church is home to the First Unitarian Universalist Society of Burlington, Vermont, which is a member congregation of the Unitarian Universalist Association and Northern New England District. History The Unitarian Society was originally part of the Congregational church that was organized in Burlington, Vermont on February 23, 1805. However, in 1810, the Congregational Society divided into the Trinitarian or Calvinistic Society, which embraced the doctrine of the Trinity, and the Unitarian Society, which rejected it. The Rev. Daniel Haskel was ordained over the Trinitarian society on April 10, 1810, where the Rev. Samuel Clark was ordained over the Unitarian Society on April 19 of that year. The laying of the cornerstone of the Unitarian church occurred around the 1st of May in 1816, with the remainder of the construction taking about seven months to complete at an approximate cost of $23,000, including the clock, bell, and organ (which was transported from Boston by sleigh). In December of that year, the pews of the lower floor were sold \\"for upwards of $21,000\\". The Unitarian Society appointed E.T. Englesby as the superintendent to officiate the completion of the building. The Burlington Northern Sentinel issue of December 27, 1816 described the church as \\"91 feet in length, 60 in breadth, with a steeple of 170 feet in height\\". The Church was dedicated on January 9, 1817. In 1910, prompted by a letter from historical researcher from Boston, the Burlington city treasurer L.C. Grant had discovered that the original bell for the church was cast by Paul Revere on October 13, 1816. The bell weighing , along with its tongue weighing was sold to the Town of Burlington for $592.65 (at a cost of $0.45 per pound). The bell was recast in 1828 (at a cost of $166.88), and was replaced sometime in the 1900s after a crack had developed. In August 1954, the church steeple was struck by lightning that unknowingly caused extensive deterioration over the course of the ensuing sixteen months, until it was revealed that the base had settled and tilted eastward by approximately two feet. By 1956, the decision was made to demolish the steeple, which took about six weeks to complete. Steeplejacks out of Framingham, Massachusetts managed to salvage the windows, bell, and pieces of metal sheathing during the process. A replacement spire was completed and dedicated in September 1958. The presiding pastor of the time, the Rev. Robert S. Miller had commented that the project was financed by a $55,000 fund drive \\"to which people of nearly all faiths contributed\\".

Nevertheless, other people believe it is not really a pomegranate but a blossom of a flower of Quereme, that is only typical of those mountains. It is claimed that appeared miraculously in the 1570s carved as a natural formation in white Quartz stone at the most Western Colombian Andes, called The Choco mountain range, close to the Pacific. Today the original white solid rock material is in its front covered by colonial paint artisanal work that was applied by artists trying to give to the image a more Spanish colonial look. thumbnail This Virgin was brought around 1580 from its original apparition place, the Queremal valley, Where she was venerated as the Queen of the Mountain, to Santiago de Cali by the Priest Miguel de Soto who decided to travel to the area to confirm the miracle but also alarmed by the possibility that the native aborigines would be taken part in a pagan cult praising to an idol. The colonial chronicles say that amazingly the image disappeared from the Church twice and appeared again back in the same original place in the middle of the mountains where it was originally found, about more than 35 miles distant to the west, for the perplexity of the people, causing great confusion among the monks. thumbnail Finally, the Superior nun of the convent was hosting the image had a vision in dreams where she got that the Lady wanted to have its own chapel in the temple decorated with figures of Aborigines and native plants in order to remain in Cali. As soon as the chapel was finished the Virgin was again moved to there from the mountains and she never return to them. thumbnail She is since those colonial times in permanent place of exhibition and adoration, in an altar inside the traditional La Merced Church at the downtown of the city, the very foundational site of the city. The image has been called with different names since then by the Hispanic people, initially known as Our lady of the Rosary, and even also as Our lady of the favor ( Nuestra Senora de la Merced), but just for the will of the priests to link this Virgin of the Native Andean people with well known Spanish Marian images. At present is venerated with the name of Our lady of the Remedies, a name given by the Mercedarian friars after a Virgin of the Cantabric region in Spain. The original region where this Marian apparition took place known as El Queremal ( the Love me field, from the name of endemic flowers called Quereme (love me)) is still considered as a sanctuary by the peasants and overthere she is still known as The lady of The mountain. thumbnail This figure of Virgin in Maternity was crowned as Queen of the Colombian Pacific in solemn ceremony carried out by Pope John Paul II in his visit to Santiago de Cali of 1986 at the 1971 Panamerican Games Stadium, next to the official temple erected in the 1950s to commemorate the Bolivarian countries Eucharistic congress.

He also lectured extensively on his theories in many parts of the world. His books have been translated into 18 languages and reprinted many times. Early life Voisin was born on 7 January 1903 in Dieppe, a coastal community in the Upper Normandy region of France. His parents were Albert Voisin and Marie Antoinette Morthe Legendre, well known farmers and landholders. He undertook his primary and secondary studies in Dieppe at the Jehan Ango school, beginning in 1910, and subsequently at the Lyc√©e Louis-le- Grand in Paris. He undertook his military service with the French navy in 1923, graduating as a lieutenant. In 1924 he graduated with a diploma of biochemistry from the School of Physics and Chemistry, √©cole sup√©rieure de physique et de chimie industrielles de la ville de Paris. Following his graduation from the School of Physics and Chemistry, Voisin worked as an engineer in the rubber industry, initially in a tyre factory. He subsequently took on a senior engineering role in the firm SIT, and developed a method for improving the efficiency of production techniques. In 1936 he attended the University of Heidelberg in order to improve his ability with the German language. He received his diploma for a thesis entitled \\"Goethe and France\\", and was named an Honorary Citizen of the city of Heidelberg. Voisin married Martha Rosine Fernagu in occupied Paris during 1943. Military career At the outbreak of war in September 1939, Voisin quit his position in the rubber industry to join the war effort. He was initially stationed with the French Navy in Algeria. He was involved in two naval missions in the Mediterranean during 1939, being seriously injured in the second. After initial treatment in Algiers, he spent four months in the Val-de-Gr√¢ce hospital in Paris. In 1940 he undertook several ground engagements in France, and was also involved in the Narvik Campaign. Prior to the Fall of France, Voisin was ordered to evacuate to England. He and a small contingent of men crossed the English Channel from Cherbourg in a daring boat journey lasting several days. Once in England, Voisin met with Admiral Thierry d'Argenlieu and was made Secretary Attach√© to Admiral √âmile Muselier, leader of the Free French Naval Forces. In October 1940, Voisin returned to occupied France to administer his family farm, \\"Le Talou\\", a estate in Gruchet, south of Arques-la-Bataille. From 1941 to 1944 he assisted the Resistance by secretly arranging deliveries of food produced on the farm. He also acted as a translator for the mayor, Albert Thoumyer, in dealings with the Nazi occupiers. In March 1943, he advocated successfully to save a farmer from the firing squad. After the liberation of Paris in August 1944, Voisin left Le Talou in the care of his wife and travelled to Paris to meet with Admiral d'Argenlieu. Lieutenant Voisin was assigned a regiment of marine infantry and was then involved in several campaigns with the Free French forces, notably the short-lived but intense Battle of the Vosges in October. He was injured again in Benfeld. In 1946 Voisin published his memoirs of the war, based on his war diaries, under the title A Single Foot on the Earth. It was illustrated by the official Navy artist, Commander Luc-Marie Bayle Return to farming Towards the end of 1945, having fulfilled his duty to his country, Voisin returned to Gruchet to pursue his true passion of farming. Voisin would derive great pleasure simply from observing his cattle graze the sward. He noticed differences between the action of a grazing cow versus mowing and feeding hay. Whereas a sward mown for hay is all cut at essentially the same time, a grazed pasture is only cut as fast as the herd is able to eat it. Likewise while a feedlot cow may eat as much as she wants without moving, a pastured cow must both walk to a desirable part of the pasture, and then shear the grass with her teeth one mouthful at a time. Over time he came to the realisation that existing theories of grazing did not accurately describe the conditions of a grazing animal. In an attempt to follow the scientific method, researchers would focus on the growing of grass (without grazing animals), or the feeding of cut grass to animals in feedlots, but very rarely the behaviour of cattle grazing on pasture. Voisin realised that this relationship ‚Äì which he called \\"the meeting of cow and grass\\" ‚Äì was fundamentally different to either action performed in isolation. These realities led Voisin to the realisation that time is critical. It is not the number of animals per acre, but the time which plants are exposed to animals which is the chief determinant of overgrazing. If animals are permitted to remain on the pasture too long, a palatable plant will be grazed a second time before it has had time to recover from the first. Also, repeated grazing at short intervals does not allow the plant to achieve its maximum growth rate, thus limiting the amount of sunlight energy captured and converted to useful feed by the plant. The work Voisin was conducting on his farm began to attract scientific attention. From 1951, Voisin was invited to give lectures both at home and abroad, most notably in the United States in 1951, but also in Great Britain, Ireland and Germany. In 1956, he was appointed an associate professor at the National Veterinary School of Alfort, and a member of the Academy of Agriculture of France. In 1954, Voisin recorded an effective stocking rate for the most productive part of the grazing season (10 May ‚Äì 23 September) of 2.2 Livestock Units per acre (5.5 LU/ha). Prior to starting rational grazing, Voisin claimed his stocking rate was only 0.6 LU/acre (1.5 LU/ha), representing a more-than tripling of his stocking rate. Four Laws Eventually Voisin developed his \\"four laws\\" of rational grazing; he argued that these principles were applicable universally, \\"whatever the soil conditions, climate, altitude, latitude or longitude.\\" *First Law: Before a sward, sheared with the animal‚Äôs teeth, can achieve its maximum productivity, sufficient interval must have elapsed between two successive shearings to allow the grass: **to accumulate in its roots the reserves necessary for a vigorous spurt of re-growth; **to produce its ‚Äúblaze of growth‚Äù (or high daily yield per acre). *Second Law: The total occupation period on one paddock should be sufficiently short for a grass sheared on the first day (or at the beginning) of occupation not to be cut again by the teeth of these animals before they leave the paddock. *Third Law: The animals with the greatest nutritional requirements must be helped to harvest the greatest quantity of grass of the best possible quality. *Fourth Law: If a cow is to give regular milk yields she must not stay any longer than three days on the same paddock. Yields will be at their maximum if the cow stays on one paddock for only one day. Visit to Cuba and death In June 1964, Fidel Castro extended an invitation to Voisin to deliver a series of lectures at the University of Havana in Cuba on the subject of Rational Grazing. Despite the negative perception in Europe of Castro's communist government, Voisin agreed. He and his wife arrived in Cuba on 3 December, and were personally greeted by Castro at Jose Marti Airport. Castro and Voisin, as well as numerous dignitaries, then led an inspection of a nearby farm owned by the Cuban Prime Minister. The series of lectures opened on 8 December at the University of Havana. In welcoming Voisin, Castro stated \\"Through all his works, in all his labor, it can be seen that... human health, human happiness, is the main objective of Professor Voisin's work.\\" On 11 December, Voisin was awarded an honorary doctorate from the university. At 3:50 pm on 21 December, Voisin died suddenly of a heart attack at his hotel. Fidel Castro announced his death on national television that evening. A state funeral was held the following day at the Great Hall of the University of Havana. Voisin had previously expressed to his wife the desire that, should he die whilst abroad giving lectures, his remains should be buried in the country of his death. In accordance with his wishes, Voisin was buried at Colon Cemetery, Havana. Legacy Voisin became, and remains, a celebrated figure in Cuba. The Cuban government declared 1965 \\"The Year of Agriculture\\" in homage to Voisin, and a commemorative stamp was issued on the first anniversary of his death, having a face value of 3¬¢. Martha Voisin developed a deep fondness for Cuba, and visited many times until her death in 2006 at age 105. She was buried in Havana alongside her husband. Despite Castro's advocacy of his work and its presence in Cuban academia, Voisin's methods were largely ignored by Cuban farmers until forced to adopt less input-intensive methods following the collapse of the Communist Common Market in 1989, which plunged Cuba into a three-year economic crisis which became known as the Special Period. The loss of Soviet energy and chemical imports necessitated the transition to \\"an organic and skill-intensive agroecological model\\" based on the principles of Voisinism. The transition was successful; in 1989, Cuban agriculture had been similar to that practiced in California, but by 1992 it was more akin to that practiced in Amish communities. By 1995, the practice of urban agriculture, particularly via the use of organoponicos, was widespread. In the 1980s and later, Voisin's work received increased attention from English-speaking authors, notably Allan Nation, Joel Salatin and Allan Savory. Savory is perhaps the most vocal advocate of Voisin's methods among western authors. Voisin's principles strongly influenced his development of Holistic management). Savory later wrote an introduction for the 1988 reprint of Grass Productivity. Although Voisin's research is now considered one of the foundational works of the permaculture, holistic management and grass-fed beef movements, he remains relatively unknown in his home country. According to a socialist compatriot G√©rard Pestrinaux, he is a political paradox: \\"(Voisin) was not a man of the left, but a classic Gaullist right, and yet he is buried in the cemetery of the heroes of the Cuban Revolution!\\" Publications * A Single Foot on the Earth (1946) ‚Äì war memoirs based on Voisin's diaries.

It was first published in the Moscow Almanac in 1939 (pp. 256‚Äì266). It was later included in The Malachite Casket collection. \\"Sinyushka's Well\\" is one of the most famous stories in the collection and is still popular nowadays. The story was translated from Russian into English by Alan Moray Williams in 1944, and by Eve Manning in the 1950s. It is one of the tales about mining pioneers.Bazhov 1952, p. 234. The tale is told from the point of view of the imaginary Old Man Slyshko (; alternative translation: Grandpa Slyshko). There is a blue fog above Sinyushka's well.Bazhov 1952, p. 233. Her main function is to keep the mountain riches from the greedy and undeserving.Shvabauer 2009, p. 119. Nataliya Shvabauer believed that this character did not exist in the original Ural folk tradition, but the author constructed it according to the \\"mythological canon\\".  Publication  The tale was not included in the first edition of The Malachite Box. Inspired by its success, Bazhov continued working on his stories. The tales \\"Sinyushka's Well\\", \\"Silver Hoof\\", and \\"The Demidov Caftans\\" were finished even before the publication of the first edition. Bazhov's stories are based on the oral lore of the miners and gold prospectors. When questioned about the source, Bazhov quoted the Ural anecdote about a man who was walking home drunk, and decided to drink some water from the well. The girl appeared from the well, and \\"the rest is indecent\\". Bazhov claimed that he heard about the character near the Zuzelsky mine. In 1944 the story was translated from Russian into English by Alan Moray Williams and published by Hutchinson as a part of The Malachite Casket: Tales from the Urals collection. The title was translated as \\"Sinyushka's Well\\".Bazhov 1944, p. 138. In the 1950s another translation of The Malachite Casket was made by Eve Manning The story was published as \\"The Blue Crone's Spring\\".Bazhov 1950s, p. 9. It was included in James Riordan's collection of stories The Mistress of the Copper Mountain: Tales from the Urals, published in 1974 by Frederick Muller Ltd. Riordan heard the tales from a headteacher when he was bedridden in Sverdlovsk. After returning to England he rewrote the tales from memory, checking them against Bazhov's book. He preferred not to call himself \\"translator\\", he believed that \\"communicator\\" was more appropriate. He translated the title as \\"The Blue Baba of the Marsh\\".  Plot summary The factory guy Ilya walks through the forest and comes across a water well. He wants to drink some water, but suddenly a crone comes out of the well. Her name is The Blue Crone (Sinyushka). She looks very old, but has a young voice and good-looking teeth. She orders Ilya to come back at night when a moon is full and promises to shower him with riches. Ilya is not interested in money, he wishes to see how The Blue Crone \\"turns into a lovely maid\\", because she only shows this face in front of brave and simple people. Sinyushka challenges the hero to scoop up and drink water from her well. After seeing the maid, Ilya cannot forget her until he meets a real girl that looks almost like the Crone. Ilya marries her, but the girl worked at the marble quarries since childhood, and suffers from tuberculosis. She doesn't live long, and Ilya dies soon after.  Analysis  Marsh gas was called \\"sinyushka\\" at the Urals. The crone (Sinyushka) was one of the mythical creatures created by the populace to explain various unexplained natural phenomena. Sinyushka acts like a magical helper and presents a threat to the characters at the same time. She represents deceptive and deadly marsh gas, which was actually called \\"sinyushka\\" at the Urals. Marina Balina suggested that a contact Sinyushka is a symbolic manifestation of death. As one of the \\"mountain spirits\\", she does not hesitate to kill those who did not pass her tests, but even those who had been rewarded by her do not live happily ever after: Ilya dies soon, this time not metaphorically but literally.Shvabauer 2009, p. 120. This character is one of the few still remembered in the region.Mironov, A. \\"Obraz Hozjajki Mednoj gory v skazah P. P.

Bazhov i socialisticheskij realizm. The crone, \\"who later predictably turns into a stunning beauty\\", challenges the hero to drink water from her well. \\"The parallel of this act to a sexual challenge is emphasized by the fact that the protagonist attaches his pot to a long pole, which, however, turns out to be to weak and breaks in half, to Sinyushka's amusement. Having humiliated the protagonist's male power, the magical woman forgives and eventually rewards him with riches\\". As for the creature being female, Bazhov believed that miners simply missed women, because their work allowed for little contact with them, and therefore so many of their stories had female creatures. All sexual references in Pavel Bazhov's stories were of course very subtle, owing to Soviet puritanism. Denis Zherdev pointed out that Bazhov clearly defines important values in his stories, and Ilya is \\"an ideal man\\"‚Äî a \\"simple soul\\", brave, patient, and hard-working. Zherdev believed that the most important value for Bazhov is family. It serves as the criterion of normality in the characters' lives, e.g. the man who is married lives \\"correctly\\". But in most early stories the family happiness is short-lived, as in this one, unattainable (\\"Beloved Name\\", \\"Yermak's Swans\\"), or flawed (\\"Zhabrei's Path\\", \\"Golden Hair\\").  Adaptations  A 1947 play Tales from the Urals at the Moscow Puppet Theater was based on \\"Sinyushka's Well\\" and \\"Golden Hair\\".Bazhov 1952, p. 248. The story was adapted for children's theatre by K. Filippova. Mariya Litovskaya criticized her for oversimplifying already simple story, e.g. the ending was changed from: > With this maid Ilya found his happiness. But not for long. She came from the > marble quarries, you see, that's why he hadn't seen her before. Well, we > know what that marble cutting meant. There were no maids fairer in our parts > than the ones from there, but he who wed one was soon a widower. They worked > with that stone from the time they were children, and they were consumptive > one and all. Ilya didn't live long either.Bazhov 1950s, pp. 222, 223 To: > With this maid Ilya found his happiness. She came from the marble quarries. > That's why he hadn't seen her before. There were no maids fairer in our > parts than the ones from there. Litovskaya comments that Pavel Bazhov was not opposed to the changes. Vladimir Goryachikh composed the ballet The Living Stone () based on \\"Sinyushka's Well\\", which premiered in Nizhny Tagil in 1965.Sokolskaya, Zh. \\"P. P.

They first achieved fame as weekly performers on The Fred Allen Show from 1946 to 1949, and were featured singers in the 1952 film Skirts Ahoy! with actress Esther Williams. The group was initially composed of five biological sisters. Music critics have compared their sound and style to that of The King Sisters. They made recordings for Majestic Records and Mercury Records among other labels. History The DeMarco Sisters consisted of five sisters originally from Rome, New York: Antoinette (Anne), Jeanette (Gina), Gloria, Terri, and Arlene. Joann Quartuccio-Bean, joined the group from 1949-1953. Later, singer Joyce DeYoung, who also sang as a member of The Andrews Sisters during her career, joined the group in 1955 when Terri married actor Murray Hamilton and left the group. The DeMarco Sisters were originally a vocal trio consisting of Anne, Gina, and Gloria. Believing in their talent, the DeMarcos' father moved his family from Rome, New York, to an apartment in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, in the hopes of earning the girls a contract with NBC radio. He managed to squeeze in an impromptu audition for his daughters with an NBC producer, and landed the girls a spot on a 1935 broadcast of Uncle Charlie's Tent Show which was hosted by Loretta Clemens Tupper and her brother Jack Clemens. The girls drew the attention of Paul Whiteman who featured the group on a June 28, 1936 broadcast of Paul Whiteman's Musical Varieties. Soon after Terri and Arlene joined their sisters to form a quintet. The DeMarco Sisters continued to perform on the radio periodically during the late 1930s and early 1940s. It was not until 1946 though that they achieved wider fame, when they landed a spot as weekly performers on The Fred Allen Show. The girls sang the opening of each show, \\"Mr. Al-len, Mr. Alll-llennnn\\", in addition to popular songs of the day. They were paid $1,000 per week for their performance, funds which enabled the family to afford a much larger and nicer apartment in Flatbush, Brooklyn. The girls sometimes performed with tenor Robert White, who was just a child at the time, on the program. White was notably trapped at the DeMarcos' home for four days during the North American blizzard of 1947. The girls' performances on the Allen Show ended after four years in 1949. The DeMarco Sisters also made guest appearances on several television programs, including The Colgate Comedy Hour, The George Jessel Show, The Jackie Gleason Show, The Kate Smith Show, Texaco Star Theater, What's My Line?, and Ed Sullivan's Toast of the Town. Some of their fellow performers on these programs included Tony Bennett, Nat King Cole and Frank Sinatra. The quintet was also featured in the 1952 Esther Williams film Skirts Ahoy! in which they sang the song \\"What Good is a Gal Without a Guy\\".

Biography Early life James Scott was born in the city of Wells, England, the youngest son of two artists, William and Mary Scott. As a young man, he studied painting and theater design at the Slade School of Fine Art in London. After his first student art exhibition, he was featured in The London Times review of the Young Contemporaries exhibit. His interest in film-making and photography led him to write and direct his first movie while still at the Slade, a 16mm dramatic short called The Rocking Horse (1962). The film was given an X-certificate by the board of film censors, but went on to become an official British entry at the Venice and Vancouver film festivals that year. This recognition led to Scott meeting Tony Richardson and John Osborne of Woodfall Films, who signed him to write and direct his first feature film The Sea, but the film was never completed. In 1964, Scott wrote and produced the short dramatic film Changes which featured the young Anthony Hopkins fresh from acting school (RADA). In 1965, he founded the production company Maya Film Productions with Barney Platts-Mills and Adam Barker-Mill. Film career Art documentaries In the mid-1960s, Scott began directing a series of artist‚Äôs documentaries. The first, Love‚Äôs Presentation (1966), follows David Hockney as he worked on his Cavafy etching series. After this came 1967‚Äôs RB Kitaj and 1969‚Äôs Richard Hamilton, both made for the Arts Council of Great Britain. In 1970 he made his next artist documentary, The Great Ice Cream Robbery. The double-screen film was based on a visit to London with Claes Oldenburg and Hannah Wilke at the time of Oldenburg‚Äôs retrospective at the Tate Gallery. In 1974, he began a new film on Antoni Tapies (incomplete) In 1979‚Äì1980, he wrote and directed the award-winning documentary Chance, History, Art‚Ä¶ for the Arts Council of Great Britain. Political film career and the Berwick Street Film Collective In 1970, Scott teamed up with Marc Karlin to found the London-based Berwick Street Film Collective. They were joined by Richard Mordaunt, Humphry Trevelyan and Mary Kelly. The collective made political films that were as aesthetically radical as they were socially progressive. During this period, Scott was a founder member of the Independent Filmmakers Association, London (IFA) and joined the board of The Other Cinema. In 1975, the Collective released Nightcleaners (Part 1). Nightcleaners was originally conceived of as a film documenting attempts to unionize women working at night as contract cleaners in office buildings. The finished film appeared at the Edinburgh Film Festival, and, upon its release, ‚Äúwas attacked and praised with a passion not normally evoked in Britain by a cultural event.‚Äù Members of the Collective continued to collaborate on ‚Äô36 to ‚Äô77, the second part to Nightcleaners, for the British Film Institute, London. Dramatic features and cultural recognition Scott wrote and directed his first feature film Adult Fun in 1971. In 1976, he wrote and directed the feature film Coilin and Platonida for the German television station ZDF. The next few years saw retrospectives of his cinematic work being shown at The National Film Theatre, London, The National Cinematheques in Paris, Madrid and Barcelona, the Institute of Contemporary Art, London and Film International in Rotterdam, Holland. Academy Award win and Hollywood career Soon after producing the short film Couples and Robbers, Scott wrote and directed A Shocking Accident (1982). Based on a short story by Graham Greene, the film starred Rupert Everett and Jenny Seagrove. In 1983, A Shocking Accident won the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film at the 55th Academy Awards. The producer of the film, Christine Oestreicher, was the recipient of the Academy Award and in her acceptance speech she thanked Scott as \\"the most important person, who‚Äôs provided the magic touch\\" It was nominated in the same category at the 1984 BAFTAs. In 1984, Scott directed the feature film Every Picture Tells A Story for Channel Four TV. Based on the early life of his father, the acclaimed British painter William Scott, the film starred Alex Norton, Phyllis Logan, and Natasha Richardson. In 1988, Scott wrote and directed the feature film Loser Takes All, also known as Strike It Rich, based on a novel by Graham Greene. The film starred Molly Ringwald, Robert Lindsay, and John Gielgud and was distributed by Miramax Films. Move to Los Angeles and return to painting In 1990, Scott moved to Los Angeles, California, where he has since returned to his roots in painting, drawing and printmaking. He has shown in a number of exhibitions across the States. In 2013, James and his brother Robert organized their father William Scott‚Äôs Centenary exhibitions at such institutions as the Tate St. Ives, Wakefield and the Ulster Museum in Belfast. More than forty years later, Scott's films continue to be exhibited in screenings worldwide. The Great Ice Cream Robbery was shown in 2013 at the BFI Southbank Theatre in London as part of their Expanded Cinema program as well as at Light Industry in NYC. Every Picture Tells A Story was in the BFI April 2013 Projecting the Archive series. Richard Hamilton has been featured in a 2014 Hamilton retrospective at the Tate Modern and at the Madrid Museo Reina Sofia, in the Hayward Gallery in London‚Äôs ‚ÄúHistory is Now: 7 Artists Take On Britain‚Äù, and at the NSW Art Gallery in Australia alongside Love‚Äôs Presentation. It was also the subject of an online presentation curated by Harun Farocki at the Neuer Berliner Kunstvverein, Berlin, and recently played at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota for their ‚ÄúInternational Pop‚Äù show which will continue to the Dallas Museum of Art and the Philadelphia Museum of Art through 2016. Nightcleaners was presented this past April at the BFI Southbank Theatre as part of a series on seventies cutting edge political films and was included in the Okwui Enwezor- curated All the World‚Äôs Futures show at this year‚Äôs Venice Biennale. Richard Hamilton and The Great Ice Cream Robbery are being screened as part of the Getty Research Institute‚Äôs Art on Screen program in December 2015. Pedagogy and professional bodies Scott began teaching film at Bath Academy of Art in 1964 and later taught film at Maidstone College of Art, the Royal College of Art, the National Film and Television School and the University of Southern California. He is a member of the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Directors Guild of America. References Celant, Germano (1995). Claes Oldenburg: An Anthology.

On 2 August that year, police responded to a report that Dhu's partner had violated an apprehended violence order. Upon arriving at their address, the officers arrested both Dhu and her partner after realising there was also an outstanding arrest warrant for unpaid fines against Dhu. She was detained in police custody in South Hedland and was ordered to serve four days in custody in default of her debt. While in custody, Dhu complained of pain and was twice taken to the Hedland Health Campus hospital. Medical staff judged that her complaints were exaggerated and associated with drug withdrawal. On 4 August, Dhu complained that she could no longer stand. Police officers, who accused her of faking her condition, handcuffed her, carried her to the back of their van and returned her to the hospital; she was pronounced dead shortly after arrival. The official cause of death was an infection due to her partner's breaking of her ribs three months earlier. An internal police investigation found that 11 officers had failed to comply with regulations or were otherwise guilty of misconduct. They were given written and oral warnings. A coronial inquest found that she had suffered \\"unprofessional and inhumane\\" handling by police and \\"deficient\\" treatment from hospital staff. It also established that police and hospital staff had been influenced by preconceived ideas about Aboriginal people. The inquest recommended that the justice system should stop imprisoning people for unpaid fines and introduce a Custody Notification Scheme (CNS). After years of delays, a CNS was made operational in October 2019. Attorney-General of Western Australia John Quigley introduced legislative amendments to cease jailing people for unpaid fines in September 2019, which were implemented in June 2020. Background Ms Dhu Julieka Ivanna Dhu was born on 26 December 1991 in Port Hedland, Western Australia (WA). She was Aboriginal and of the Yamatji people. She lived with her parents until they separated when she was three, after which she was mostly raised by her grandmother in Geraldton, though her parents remained in regular contact with her. She was described as a \\"cheerful\\" child whose only health issue was mild asthma. Dhu completed Year Eleven; according to her family, after leaving school, she seemed to associate \\"with a bad crowd\\" and was a \\"wild child\\". In November 2009, when she was 17, police found Dhu sleeping near Cable Beach; when they woke her she appeared to be intoxicated, swore at them and said \\"I don't remember anything after taking that eccy\\". Police arrested her for disorderly conduct and failing to give her name and address, and she was detained in police custody overnight. She was released on bail the next day but failed to appear at her hearing at the Children's Court and was fined $200. The following year, Dhu was involved in two more minor incidents involving police after she moved back to Port Hedland. On one of the occasions, she kicked a female police officer while being arrested for disorderly conduct and was later also charged with obstructing and assaulting police. Dhu was again fined by the courts. In 2013, at age 21, Dhu began a relationship with a 42-year-old man, Dion Ruffin, who had several children by previous partners and‚Äîunknown to Dhu‚Äîhad criminal convictions for domestic violence. By late December that year, Dhu's mother said her daughter had become withdrawn and had lost weight. Dhu told her mother that she and Ruffin were using methamphetamines and their fortnightly Centrelink payments were always spent on the drug in a day or two. Around the Easter holidays in 2014, Dhu told her grandmother Ruffin had physically assaulted her. Her grandmother helped Dhu leave Ruffin and paid for the bus journey from Geraldton to Karratha, where they had relatives. Ruffin discovered where Dhu had sought refuge and after several weeks persuaded her to return to him. They lived together in a rented house in South Hedland. In July 2014, Dhu told her father Ruffin had broken her ribs. Ruffin subsequently admitted to the assault, saying he struck her after she had stabbed him in the leg with a pair of scissors. Incarceration In 1991, the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody report was released. One of its 339 recommendations was an end to issuing arrest warrants for unpaid fines, and another was the implementation of Custody Notification Schemes (CNS) in all Australian states and territories. At the time of Dhu's death, New South Wales (NSW) and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) were the only state and territory to have implemented a CNS. The CNS consists of a 24-hour legal advice and support telephone hotline for any Aboriginal person taken into custody, connecting them with lawyers from the Aboriginal Legal Service. , no Aboriginal person had died in custody in NSW or the ACT since the scheme was implemented. At the time of Dhu's death, Western Australia was the only Australian state still imprisoning people for unpaid fines; NSW was the first state to abandon the practice following a death in custody in 1987. Every year between 2010 and 2014, more than 1,000 people were sent to prison in WA for unpaid fines, and one third of imprisoned women were there for that reason. , one sixth of imprisoned Aboriginal people were there for unpaid fines; the number increased from 33 to 223 between 2008 and 2013. In 2015, then Premier of Western Australia Colin Barnett acknowledged that the number of people incarcerated for unpaid fines is unknown but higher than official records show, as government statistics only count people being sent to prisons, and not those sent to police lockup cells for shorter periods. Between mid-2006 and mid-2016, 73% of female fine defaulters in Western Australia were unemployed, and 64% were Indigenous. Being jailed for unpaid fines in WA will result in a criminal record, whereas in all other Australian states and territories fines are considered a civil matter. WA police did not have the discretion to ignore arrest warrants for unpaid fines under any circumstances. Arrest On 2 August 2014, police received a telephone call informing them Ruffin had violated the terms of an apprehended violence order; at the later inquest into her death, nobody gave evidence about the caller's identity. Three months earlier, a warrant for her arrest for the unpaid fines relating to her three arrests when she was a teenager had been issued. When police arrived at their home and spoke to the pair, they discovered the outstanding arrest warrant for Dhu. Both were arrested and placed in adjoining cells in the South Hedland police station. Dhu's fines totaled $3,622, and she was ordered to serve four days in custody to repay part of the debt at the standard rate of $250 per day. , Ruffin was in prison for violating the apprehended violence order, burglary, assault and criminal damage. The Western Australia Prisoners' Review Board revoked his bail, saying he was \\"a lethal threat to the community\\". Deterioration and death Dhu complained of pain soon after her arrest. When police asked Dhu why she was in pain, she was vague with her answers; Ruffin was sitting nearby when she was questioned. Police officers gave her two paracetemol tablets and took her to the Hedland Health Campus at 8 pm that night. After a brief examination, she was given a triage score of four; the second-lowest level of urgency. Dr. Annie Lang, who assessed Dhu, later told the inquest she believed Dhu's pain was genuine but that she was exaggerating her condition. She gave Dhu endone and diazepam, and declared her well enough to return to police custody. Dhu was returned to her cell shortly thereafter. Over the next 20 hours, witnesses saw Dhu crying, calling for help, vomiting and asking to return to the hospital. CCTV footage shows Dhu being asked to rate her pain out of ten and replying \\"ten\\". When Sergeant Rick Bond went on duty as the senior officer on 3 August, he was told of Dhu's condition and telephoned her father to ask him whether he could pay Dhu's fines so she could be released. Dhu's father told Bond he did not have that much money and also told him Dhu was a user of methamphetamine. Bond later told the inquest he formed the opinion that Dhu was faking her condition so she would be removed from her cell; he informed other officers of his opinion. Late that afternoon, police took Dhu, who was handcuffed, back to the Health Campus. Medical staff notes said Dhu was \\"Crying in pain ... tachycardic, grunting, dehydrated and had a pulse rate of 126 beats a minute\\". They did not take her temperature because they had a shortage of thermometers. Triage nurse Alyce Heatherington told police \\"this could be withdrawal from drugs\\". Dr. Vafa Naderi, who had witnessed Dhu attending the Health Campus the previous night, performed an ultrasound examination on her chest then discharged her with a paracetamol tablet and declared her well enough to return to police custody. His notes from that night say \\"behavioural issues\\" and \\"drugs?\\". CCTV footage taken when police returned Dhu to the station showed a police officer saying, \\"Paracetamol? Paracetamol, after all that?\\". CCTV footage also showed Bond took another person held in police custody to Dhu's cell, told them to look at Dhu and said \\"This is what happens, you end up like this woman here. It's a good deterrent not to take drugs.\\" Dhu asked to go to the hospital again on the morning of 4 August, telling officers she was no longer able to stand. Officer Shelly Burgess, who had just arrived on shift, stated that Sgt. Bond told her Dhu was a \\"junkie\\" that was \\"full of shit\\" and \\"faking\\" her illness. Burgess said she accepted his assertion as \\"his word was law\\" and he had a reputation for \\"verbally attacking\\" people who questioned him. She testified that Bond whispered in Dhu's ear, \\"You're a fucking junkie and you've been to hospital twice before and this is not fucking on\\". Bond said he had not told Dhu she was a junkie, though said he may have used the term when talking about her to other officers. He said he had told her, \\"This is the last fucking time you're going to hospital\\" after agreeing for her to be returned there. CCTV footage showed Burgess forcing Dhu into a sitting position from the floor. After letting go of her arm, Dhu slumped back down and hit her head on the concrete. Burgess told the inquest that Dhu had slipped. At 12:30 pm, Bond sent Dhu to the hospital for the third time. Burgess and Constable Christopher Matier handcuffed Dhu and carried her to the back of a police van; CCTV footage captured her moaning in pain and Matier saying \\"Oh shut up\\". Upon arrival at the Health Campus, Matier told a nurse \\"She's just putting it on; she's faking it\\"; nursing staff responded by saying she had had a heart attack. A team of medical staff attempted to resuscitate Dhu; Matier continued to inform them that she was faking her condition while they were making their resuscitation attempt. Fifty-three minutes after arriving at the hospital, Dhu was declared dead. Her death marked roughly 340 Aboriginal deaths in custody since the conclusion of the 1991 Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. Coroner's inquest alt=A group of demonstrators with a banner outside a public building In October 2014, after more details of her time in custody had been made public, Dhu's family asked for a coroner's inquest into her death. They also called for the end of imprisonment for unpaid fines, the introduction of a CNS, 24-hour medical coverage and independent oversight at all police stations, \\"and justice reinvestment into communities, not prisons\\". These calls were supported by Greens party MP Robin Chapple. At that time, the government of Western Australia and WA police were still said to be investigating the matter; a report was being prepared for the coroner. Premier Barnett expressed his sympathy for Dhu's family at a Perth rally in late 2014, and promised to make sure that \\"the full truth will come out\\", but insisted the inquest they were calling for would not be necessary. In February 2016, an anonymous activist group called 'allies of Ms Dhu' began projecting images of Dhu and her family on buildings in Perth to raise awareness over her death and the upcoming inquest. On the first anniversary of her death, multiple protests were held around Australia demanding an investigation. Dhu's death and her family's activism attracted national media attention, something that is rare for Aboriginal deaths in custody. The inquest began in November 2015. Members of the public were warned that anyone wearing a T-shirt bearing the words \\"Justice for Julieka\\" would be denied entry. Two women wearing shirts that read \\"Indigenous Rights Defender\\" were not allowed to enter. On the first day, the inquest heard that Dhu's cause of death was pneumonia and sepsis resulting from broken ribs caused by Ruffin three months prior. CCTV footage of Dhu in police custody was also shown. Members of Dhu's family, medical staff involved in her treatments and 10 police officers were interviewed as part of the inquest. Dhu's mother testified that she twice telephoned the police station asking to speak to Dhu while she was in custody, but was refused permission. Human rights lawyer George Newhouse represented the Deaths In Custody Watch Committee (WA) Inc (DICWC WA) at the inquest. In the days after the inquest began, Dhu's family were subjected to a \\"flood\\" of online comments, suggesting that Dhu got what she deserved as she was a criminal. Police and medical staff consistently testified they thought Dhu had been faking her illness; Burgess said she thought Dhu had pretended to faint to get quicker treatment. The inquest heard that 11 police officers had received disciplinary notices for failing to follow correct procedure and that an internal police investigation found four of them had \\"engaged in unprofessional conduct\\" and their handling of the situation was \\"without any sense of urgency ... [they] failed to comprehend and respond to the seriousness of the situation\\". Burgess received the severest disciplinary action of the eleven; a warning notice from the assistant commissioner for the \\"lack of urgency\\" she displayed after Dhu hit her head on the concrete. Three other officers were given written warnings and seven received verbal warnings. None of the warnings resulted in immediate disciplinary action; they only affected the officers' chance of promotion. Most of the police officers told the inquest that at the time they did not understand the notices or the reasons they had been given them. Two of the officers who received warnings had since been promoted; Sgt. Bond had quit the police force, telling the inquest he had done so for \\"family reasons\\". When asked if he treated Dhu inhumanely, Bond responded, \\"I wouldn't say inhumane. I would say unprofessional.\\" A medical expert testified that if Dhu's condition had been correctly diagnosed on her second visit to hospital, her life could have been saved. Sandra Thompson, Professor of Rural Health at the University of Western Australia, told the inquest that if Dhu had been a white middle-class person, \\"there would have been much more effort made to understand what was going on with that person's pain. So that's what institutional racism represents.\\" Senior medical officer Ganesan Sakarapani said the Hedland Health Campus did not have a culture of institutionalised racism and rejected a suggestion that if Dhu had been white, she would have been treated differently. The inquest by State Coroner Rosalinda Fogliani was completed on 15 December 2016. Fogliani found that police had subjected Dhu to \\"unprofessional and inhumane\\" treatment that was \\"well below the standards that should ordinarily be expected\\". She stated Dhu's treatment at her second hospital visit was \\"deficient\\", that both police and hospital staff had been influenced by preconceived ideas about Aboriginals, and that the decision to handcuff Dhu when she was nearly unconscious was \\"shameful\\". While the inquest was still open, Fogliani declined requests to release the footage of Dhu in custody, saying that Dhu's privacy outweighed the public interest. The refusal resulted in a backlash from Dhu's family and Aboriginal rights groups, who argued the refusal amounted to a \\"cover up\\" of racism. A social media campaign, using the hashtag #releasethecctv, called for the footage to be released. Upon delivering the inquest's findings, Fogliani ordered that the footage be made public, with the exception of her third hospital visit. Fogliani did not recommend any criminal prosecutions against police or hospital staff, though did recommend the cessation of the practice of jailing people for unpaid fines and the introduction of a mandatory CNS. Reaction Dhu's family were unhappy with the result as the inquest did not hold any person accountable for her death, and told media they intended to pursue further legal action. WA Police Commissioner Karl O'Callaghan said he accepted that the police force had failed to provide for Dhu's safety, welfare and dignity. Dennis Eggington, the chief executive of the Aboriginal Legal Service of Western Australia (ALSWA), said the coroner's recommendations were \\"fine\\" but they had come too late. Upon receiving a copy of the inquest, Premier Barnett indicated that he would not be implementing either of its recommendations. Shortly after the release of the inquest, singer Felix Riebl composed a tribute song titled \\"Ms Dhu\\", and released an accompanying music video criticising the police and the government over her death. Images of Dhu and footage of her treatment by police has circulated online in association with the Black Lives Matter, SayHerName and Idle No More movements, which was credited with creating solidarity between Aboriginal campaigns for justice and North American and global movements. An article in the journal Social & Legal Studies argued that Dhu's death was inherently linked to \\"gendered, institutional and structural racism\\" endemic to Australia, and that the coroner showed little consideration for this and instead attributed the death to a series of \\"individual failures\\". The article noted the inquest's finding that the only person who treated Dhu with dignity was the most inexperienced officer involved, and argued that this was because that officer had had the least amount of exposure to the culture of the WA police force. An article in the journal Settler Colonial Studies reached similar conclusions, arguing that the inquest was \\"a performative attempt in the maintenance of [Australia's colonial] conquest\\", which was \\"incapable of addressing the foundations of Ms. Dhu's suffering: colonial patriarchy and dispossession, in the form of the settler carceral state\\". Aftermath In June 2015, in direct response to Dhu's death, the WA state government announced that police detention would be made safer and that efforts would be made to keep some low-level offenders and youth offenders out of custody. It did not clarify whether this would include people who had unpaid fines. ALSWA welcomed the announcement but said it needed to be backed up with action. Dhu's grandmother said the proposed changes did not address all of her concerns, though they were a good start. Joe Francis, then Minister for Corrective Services, opposed any plans to end jailing people for unpaid fines; earlier that year he had called for even harsher penalties for fine defaulters, including longer prison sentences. Marc Newhouse, chairman of the DICWC WA, said Francis' proposal made government promises to reduce the incarceration rate for Aboriginals \\"look like a lie\\", and University of Western Australia criminologist Dr Hilde Tubex said such a proposal would negatively impact on indigenous people, women and those affected by poverty. In May 2016, a report by Neil Morgan, Inspector of Custodial Services, recommended that WA stop jailing people for unpaid fines. His report mentioned the Dhu case. In October 2016 Nigel Scullion, the federal Minister for Indigenous Affairs, offered to fund the first three years of implementation for any state that legislated a CNS. The WA state government rejected the offer. In March 2017, just prior to the 2017 state election, Dhu's family criticised both of the major political parties in WA for not supporting such a scheme. The incumbent Liberal Party voiced their opposition to the program while the Labor Party said they would consider the scheme but made no commitments. The Labor Party voiced its support for the end of the jailing of people for unpaid fines. In September 2017, Dhu's family were awarded $1.1 million ex gratia and received a formal apology from the WA state government. The payment does not prevent Dhu's family from taking further legal action, and was separate from a civil suit lodged in the Supreme Court of Western Australia in July 2017 by them. Dhu's grandmother said she was surprised by the payment and apology, though she would have rather seen people held accountable for Dhu's death. Then Attorney-General of Western Australia John Quigley, who announced the payment, also reaffirmed his intention to implement a mandatory CNS. In October 2017, the Australian federal government was reported to be urging the other states and territories to implement a CNS. John Quigley supported such a program, saying if the Aboriginal Legal Service had been contacted about Ms Dhu's arrest \\"it would have been a very different outcome\\". An online petition calling for the scheme was signed by almost 20,000 people in less than one week. In May 2018, Dhu's cousin Alira Kelly- Ryder was informed a warrant for her arrest for unpaid fines. Kelly-Ryder had been making regular repayments on the fines but was unable to continue doing so after she became unemployed when her work contract was not renewed. A crowdsourcing campaign raised the money to pay the fines, and Kelly-Ryder then offered to pay the debt, though was informed the warrant had been withdrawn. Kelly-Ryder believed the publicity surrounding her case caused the withdrawal, though she asked \\"what about everybody else in my position; are you going to withdraw their [arrest warrants]?\\" At the time, a reform proposal to end jailing people for unpaid fines was expected to be introduced in the WA state parliament later in 2018. In October 2018, John Quigley said he would introduce legislative amendments regarding unpaid fines in 2019. In May 2018, it was announced that the WA state government had reconsidered the offer from the federal government to fund a CNS, and that the service would be operational by the end of 2018, and operated by ALSWA. The service was delayed multiple times due to issues over funding, though was launched in October 2019. In September 2019, an Aboriginal woman who had been violently assaulted was arrested and imprisoned by police for unpaid fines after she sought their assistance. After the incident, Quigley said the legislative amendments would be introduced \\"within weeks\\". Said legislation was introduced later that month, and received royal assent on 19 June 2020. On 20 June 2020, all outstanding warrants for fine defaulters were cancelled, and new warrants are no longer allowed to be issued.

It is approximately long and flows through Bridgewater Township, New Milford Township, Brooklyn Township, Lathrop Township, and Hop Bottom. The watershed of the creek has an area of . The creek is not designated as an impaired waterbody. It is a relatively small stream with a deep valley. In its upper reaches it is approximately wide. The surficial geology in the creek's vicinity mainly consists of Wisconsinan Till, alluvium, bedrock, and wetlands. The watershed of Hop Bottom Creek is relatively long in a north-south direction and narrow in an east-west direction. The area in the vicinity of the creek was settled by 1787. The first gristmill in Susquehanna County was built on the creek. A number of bridges have also been constructed over it. The creek is not stocked with trout, but does have angling opportunities. Course Hop Bottom Creek begins in an unnamed lake near Pennsylvania Route 706 in Bridgewater Township. It flows south-southwest into Heart Lake, which is in both Bridgewater Township and New Milford Township. From the southern end of the lake, the creek flows west and then southwest in Bridgewater Township, entering Lake Chrisann after a few tenths of a mile. From the southern end of this lake, the creek flows south-southeast and then south- southwest for several tenths of a mile before turning west-southwest for a few tenths of a mile. It then turns in a south-southwesterly direction for more than a mile, approaching Pennsylvania Route 167 (which it crosses a number of times) and entering Brooklyn Township. After some distance in Brooklyn Township, the creek turns southeast for several tenths of a mile before turning south-southwest and then south-southwest. After some distance, the creek gradually begins meandering southwest for more than a mile before meandering south-southeast and southeast for a few miles, still flowing alongside Pennsylvania Route 167. The creek then turns south for more than a mile, entering Lathrop Township. Here, it turns southeast for several tenths of a mile, entering Hop Bottom and crossing Pennsylvania Route 167 for the last time. At this point, it turns east-northeast, reentering Lathrop Township and reaching its confluence with Martins Creek. Hop Bottom Creek joins Martins Creek upstream of its mouth. Hydrology Hop Bottom Creek is not designated as an impaired waterobdy. Between 1965 and 1969, the discharge of Hop Bottom Creek at Brooklyn ranged from during seven measurements, with an average of . The water temperature of the creek ranged from during six measurements. The creek's pH ranged from 6.5 to 7.5 and its specific conductance ranged from 95 to 149 micro-siemens per centimeter. Between 1968 and 1969, the concentrations of magnesium and calcium in the filtered waters of Hop Bottom Creek at Brooklyn ranged from and , respectively. Between 1965 and 1967, the concentration of sodium ranged from . Between 1965 and 1969, the concentration of carbon dioxide in Hop Bottom Creek at Brooklyn ranged from and the bicarbonate concentration ranged from . The concentration of water hardness in the creek ranged from . The sulfate and chloride concentrations in the creek's filtered water ranged from and . The concentration of nitrate in the creek's filtered waters ranged from . Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Hop Bottom Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. Hop Bottom Creek is a relatively small stream that meanders through a deep valley. In its upper reaches, it has a clean channel. At the outlet of Heart Lake, the creek's channel is wide and deep. The headwaters of Hop Bottom Creek are in a beaded valley, with alternating broad and narrow segments. Wetlands or lakes sometimes occur in the broad parts. The surficial geology along the lower reaches of Hop Bottom Creek mainly consists of alluvium. However, a till known as Wisconsinan Till is found nearby in larger areas, and some bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale is also present. Additionally, there is one wetland patch nearby. The surficial geology in the creek's headwaters is fairly similar, but there is no alluvium above Lake Chrisann, only Wisconsinan Till. Soils in the vicinity of Hop Bottom Creek include Wyalusing silt loam, Holly silt loam, Wellsboro channery silt, and Lordstown and Oquaga stony silt loams. The first two of these are hydric, the third is mostly non-hydric, and the fourth is non- hydric. A mitigation bank project on Hop Bottom Creek and some of its unnamed tributaries was proposed in 2015. Oxbow scars in the floodplain of the creek indicate that the creek's channel has moved around its valley over time. Watershed The watershed of Hop Bottom Creek has an area of . The mouth of the creek is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Hop Bottom. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Montrose East. The creek's watershed is relatively long and narrow. It is in the vicinity of the watersheds of West Branch Meshoppen Creek, Horton Creek, Martins Creek, Salt Lick Creek, and Snake Creek. A lake known as Heart Lake is situated on Hop Bottom Creek. It has an area of and has no dam. The creek's watershed is relatively sparsely populated. The designated use for Hop Bottom Creek is aquatic life. There is a United States Geological Survey gauging station on the creek at Brooklyn. The portion of the creek's watershed that is upstream of this point has an area of . The valley of Hop Bottom Creek was cultivated by the early 1900s. There are active farming operations in the vicinity of the creek. History Hop Bottom Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1177377. The creek is also known as Hopbottom Creek. This variant name appears in a 1981 highway map of Susquehanna County, created by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. The creek is named for the wild hops that historically grew within its valley. The creek's name has been described as \\"quaint\\". The community of Hop Bottom, which is located near Hop Bottom Creek, was established in 1787. The first gristmill in Susquehanna County was constructed on Hop Bottom Creek. There was historically a cotton factory in the vicinity of the creek. A concrete tee beam bridge carrying Pennsylvania Route 167 over Hop Bottom Creek was built in Bridgewater Township in 1939 and is long. A steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying State Route 2015 over Hop Bottom Creek was built in 1945 and was repaired in 1993. It is long and is in Brooklyn Township. A two-span concrete tee beam bridge carrying State Route 2024 over the creek was built in that township in 1947 and is long. A concrete culvert bridge carrying State Route 2015 over the creek was built in 1959 and repaired in 1998. It is in Bridgewater Township and is long. A two-span prestressed box beam or girders bridge carrying Pennsylvania Route 167 was constructed across the creek in 1961 in Brooklyn Township and is long. A prestressed box beam or girders bridge carrying Pennsylvania Route 167 across the creek was built in Hop Bottom in 1962 and is long. A prestrssed box beam or girders bridge carrying T554/Quicks Hill Road over the creek was built southeast of Brooklyn in 1969 and is long. Biology Hop Bottom Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery. Hop Bottom Creek was described as having \\"excellent\\" fishing opportunities in the Tunkhannock Creek Watershed Conservation Plan in 1998. However, the creek is not stocked with trout. Eels have historically been observed in the creek. Historically, wild hops grew on the banks of the creek near the community of Hop Bottom. One of the largest blocks of unfragmented forest is on the banks of the creek.

The dormitory is the only surviving building from the Lemhi Reservation, the native homeland of the Lemhi Shoshone. Due to increasing white settlement in the Lemhi Valley in the 1860s, the Lemhi Shoshone requested their own reservation; they received a reservation in 1875, though it had little arable land. A government-sponsored school opened on the reservation in 1881, but it was sparsely attended due to poor conditions and its suppression of the native culture and language. The new girls' dormitory opened in 1903 to address the original dormitory's overcrowding and poor ventilation. The dormitory did not serve the reservation for long, as the government dissolved the reservation in 1907 and relocated its residents to Fort Hall. The dormitory building later served as a Grange hall and a community center for the area. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 12, 1998.

Appropriate reactions can be derived from this analysis. The model has nine stages ‚Äì in contrast to the earlier model of Kurt R. Spillmann,Kurt R. Spillmann und Kati Spillmann: Feindbilder. Entstehung, Funktion und M√∂glichkeiten ihres Abbaus. In: Z√ºrcher Beitr√§ge zur Sicherheitspolitik und Konfliktforschung Nr. 12, 1989, S. 19 ff which describes five distinct stages of escalation. These stages are grouped into three levels, which each contain three stages.  Levels  Glasl represents \\"escalation in his nine stage model not as an ascent to higher and higher stages of escalation, but as a descent to deeper and deeper, more primitive and more inhuman forms of dispute... [which] inevitably leads into regions that evoke great 'inhuman energies' which are not ultimately amenable to human control or restraint.\\" In the first level both parties can still win (win‚Äìwin). In the second level one of the parties loses and the other wins (win‚Äìlose), and in the third level both parties lose (lose‚Äìlose). The nine stages of conflict escalation Many different kinds of conflict can be thus analysed: divorces, conflicts between colleagues and school children, and also conflicts between states.  1st Level (Win‚ÄìWin)  ; Stage 1 ‚Äì Tension Conflicts start with tensions, e.g. the occasional clash of opinions. This is a common occurrence and is not perceived as the start of a conflict. However, if a conflict should result the positions become more fundamental. The conflict could have deeper causes. ;Stage 2 ‚Äì Debate From now on the conflict parties consider strategies to convince the counterparty of their arguments. Differences of opinion lead to a dispute. The parties try to put each other under pressure and think in terms of black and white. ; Stage 3 ‚Äì Actions instead of words The conflict parties increase the pressure on each other in order to assert their own opinion. Discussions are broken off. No more verbal communication takes place and the conflict is increasingly acerbated. Sympathy for \\"them\\" disappears.  2nd Level (Win‚ÄìLose)  ;Stage 4 ‚Äì Coalitions The conflict is acerbated by the search for sympathisers for one's cause. Believing one has right on one's side, one can denounce the opponent. The issue is no longer important: one has to win the conflict so that the opponent loses. ;Stage 5 ‚Äì Loss of face The opponent is to be denigrated by innuendo and the like. The loss of trust is complete. Loss of face means in this sense the loss of moral credibility. ;Stage 6 ‚Äì Threat strategies The conflict parties try to gain absolute control by issuing threats which demonstrate their own power. One threatens, for example, with a demand (10 million euros) which is enforced by a sanction (\\"otherwise I‚Ä≤ll blow up your main building\\") and underlined by the potential for sanction (showing the explosive). The proportions decide the credibility of the threat.  3rd Level (Lose‚ÄìLose)  ;Stage 7 ‚Äì Limited destruction One tries to severely damage the opponent with all the tricks at one's disposal. The opponent is no longer regarded as human. From now on, limited personal loss is seen as a gain if the damage to the opponent is greater. ;Stage 8 ‚Äì Total annihilation The opponent is to be annihilated by all means. ; Stage 9 ‚Äì Together into the abyss From this point personal annihilation is accepted in order to defeat the opponent.  Strategies for de-escalation and conflict solution  The model describes how two parties in a conflict behave. Solutions leading to de-escalation are not immediately apparent in this model, particularly when it appears to both conflict parties impossible to reverse the situation (e.g. an aggressive act on the territory of a state, separation of a common child from the other parent, withdrawal of nationality by a state, mass redundancy to improve shareholder value), or when one party selects conflict escalation as a strategic ploy. To achieve de-escalation Glasl assigns the following strategic models to the different stages of escalation: * Stage 1‚Äì3: mediation * Stage 3‚Äì5: process guidance * Stage 4‚Äì6: sociotherapeutic process guidance * Stage 5‚Äì7: intercession, intermediation * Stage 6‚Äì8: arbitration, court action * Stage 7‚Äì9: forcible intervention The ability to recognise and eliminate conflict-nourishing forces in a culturally neutral and non-judgemental fashion in order to de-escalate a conflict is highly advantageous in particular for managers, consultants and social workers.

Elinor Frances Vallentin (formerly Nichol; (n√©e Bertrand) (1873, Falkland Islands ‚Äì 1924, Plympton, Devon) was a British botanist and botanical illustrator who made scientifically significant collections of botany specimens in the Falkland Islands. She co-authored the book Illustrations of the flowering plants and ferns of the Falkland Islands in 1921 with Enid Mary Cotton, a fellow botanist. This work was regarded as being particularly valuable because of Vallentin's botanical illustrations.  Plant collecting  Vallentin grew up at Roy Cove and at Shallow Bay in West Falkland. While living there she collected and studied the plant life in the surrounding area. From November 1909 to March 1911 she collected numerous specimens from various sites on West Falkland, which are now held at the British Museum, Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew and the Manchester Museum. She also assembled collections of seaweeds that were particularly valuable scientifically. She collaborated with Arthur Disbrowe Cotton, supplying him with specimens, and enabling him to undertake the first comprehensive study of Cryptogams from the Falkland Islands. Vallentin also collaborated with botanist Charles Henry Wright collecting plants for him, supplying him with field notes and illustrations, as well as illustrating his scientific paper The Mosses and Hepaticae of West Falkland Islands, from the collections of Mrs. Elinor Vallentin published in the Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society. In 1912 Vallentin presented her collection of some 930 plant specimens, collected in the West Falkland Islands, to Kew.  Illustrations  As well as illustrating scientific papers, Vallentin co-wrote and illustrated the book Illustrations of the flowering plants and ferns of the Falkland Islands. Cecil Victor Boley Marquand regarded Vallentin's drawings as being \\"beautiful\\". Vallentin also exhibited her illustrations at the 73rd Exhibition of the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society in 1912 as well as at the 1924 British Empire Exhibition at the Falkland Islands Court. The Manchester Museum holds some of the specimens Vallentin used to produce her coloured illustrations.  Family  Vallentin was married to fellow naturalist Rupert Vallentin.

The Nanfang caomu zhuang is the oldest work extant in any language on subtropical botany. The book contains the first descriptions of several economic plants, for instance jasmine and black pepper, as well as the earliest accounts of some agricultural techniques such as biological pest control (using \\"citrus ants\\" to protect orange crops), and the cultivation of vegetables on floating gardens (centuries before the earliest recorded Mesoamerican chinampa). Since 1273, when the Nanfang caomu zhuang was first printed in the Song dynasty, it was frequently quoted by Chinese authors, both in literature and technical books on horticulture, agriculture, and Chinese herbology. Since the 19th century (e.g., Hirth 1865 and Bretschneider 1870), many Western sinologists, botanists, and historians of plant cultivation have studied it. Ji Han The Nanfang caomu zhuang author Ji Han was \\"one of the greatest of all Chinese botanists\\" (Needham, Ho, and Lu 1976: 80). The primary source of information about Ji Han's life is the Book of Jin biography of his uncle Ji Shao (ÂµáÁ¥π), who was the son of the poet-musician Ji Kang (23‚Äì262), one of the Seven Worthies of the Bamboo Grove. Ji Han was born in 263 in Zhixian (ÈäçÁ∏£, in present-day Anhui province). His courtesy name was Jun Dao (ÂêõÈÅì \\"Gentleman's Way\\"), and his pen name Boqiuzi (‰∫≥‰∏òÂ≠ê \\"Master of Boqiu\\") refers to his residence at Boqiu (present-day Henan) near the capital Luoyang. He served as a scholar-administrator and poet on the staff of several princes. In 300, during the War of the Eight Princes, Ji Han was a military commander under the future Emperor Huai of Jin (r. 307-313), whose army suffered a defeat at Tangyin (Ëï©Èô∞), in which his uncle Ji Shao was killed protecting the emperor. Ji Han was made prefect of Xiangcheng in 304, but when it was conquered, he had to escape south to Xiangyang (present-day Hebei), and at the recommendation of the official Liu Hong (ÂäâÂºò), he was appointed governor of Guangdong in 306. However, before he could leave, Ji Han was assassinated at Xiangyang in 307 after Liu Hong's death. When Ji Han was made Governor, he appointed his friend Ge Hong, the alchemist and author of the Shenxian zhuan and Baopuzi, as aide- de-camp. Ge Hong went to Guangdong ahead of Ji, and remained there afterwards for several years, probably because he was interested in the exotic plants and unusual mineral substances of the south (Needham, Ho, and Lu 1976: 80). In addition to writing the Nanfang caomu zhuang, the \\"first botanical treatise of all time\\", Ji Han was a prolific poet, particularly fu \\"rhapsody; poetic exposition\\", and deeply interested in botany (Li 1979: 10-11). While most of his ten-volume collected works were lost, later texts quote the prefaces to Ji's poetical fu essays on the daylily, hibiscus, Platycarya tree, evergreen tree, and sweet melon. Ji Han also wrote a fu on the fashionable \\"Cold-Food Powder\\" mixture of mineral and plant drugs, which says \\"it cured his ailing son when other treatments had failed\\" (Lagerwey and L√º 2010:358). Title The title uses three common Chinese words. *N√°nfƒÅng (ÂçóÊñπ, lit. \\"south direction/region\\") \\"south; southern part of a country\\" *C«éom√π (ËçâÊú®, lit. grass/herb [and] tree\\") \\"vegetation; plants (in general)\\" *Zhu√†ng (ÁãÄ) \\"form, shape; state, condition; account, record; description, narrative\\" The title Nanfang caomu zhuang does not have a standard English translation.

The first (c«éol√®i ËçâÈ°û \\"Herbs\\", 1-29) consists of 29 herbs and plants, the second (m√πl√®i Êú®È°û \\"Trees\\", 30-57) 28 forest trees, and the third consists of (gu«íl√®i ÊûúÈ°û \\"Fruits\\", 58-74) 17 fruit trees, and (zh√∫l√®i Á´πÈ°û \\"Bamboos\\", 75-80) 6 bamboos. The Preface explains Ji Han's motive in writing the book. > The plants of Nan-yueh and Chiao-chih are the most interesting of the four > borderlands. They were not known before the Chou and Ch'in dynasties. Since > the expansion territories undertaken by Wu Ti of Han, the rare and precious > kinds were sought and brought in and the best were used as tributes. As > people of the central regions [China] are often unfamiliar with their > nature, I hereby record and describe these from what I have heard for the > benefit of future generations. (tr. Li 1979: 32) The ancient kingdom of Nanyue (\\"southern Yue\\") was located in parts of the present-day Chinese provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan; Jiaozhi was in northern Vietnam. The pre-Han dynasties were the Zhou (c. 1046‚Äì256 BCE) and Qin (221‚Äì206 BCE). Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141‚Äì87 BCE) led the Southward expansion of the Han dynasty. Among six proposed categories of Chinese authors who wrote botanical books, Ji Han and the exotic botanical Nanfang caomu zhuiang exemplify the first, \\"scholar-officials, physicians and others whose duties took them to those places within or on the borders of the empire where special plants flourished\\" (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 359). Genre The Nanfang caomu zhuang is considered the type-specimen for the \\"strange plants of the south\\" genre of Chinese botanical writings (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 28). Within the traditional Sinocentric world-view, China's \\"south\\" (nan Âçó) referred to the seaward-facing regions of present-day Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan provinces, all subtropical or tropical in climate are distinctly separate from the rest of China, which is borne out by their affiliation to a different floristic region. The Nan Mountains or Wuling (‰∫îÂ≤≠ \\"five mountain ranges\\") geographically and climatically separate Northern and Southern China, and Lingnan (\\"south of the mountain ranges\\") is another name for the subtropical area that Ji Han called Nanyue and Jiaozhi. The first book in the \\"strange plants of the south\\" genre was the (early 3rd century) Yiwu zhi (\\"Record of Strange/Foreign Things\\"), by the Eastern Han official Yang Fu. It is also known as the Nanyi yiwu zhi (ÂçóË£îÁï∞Áâ©Âøó, \\"Record of Strange Things of the Southern Borders\\"). The (c. 3rd century) Nanzhou yiwu zhi (ÂçóÊ¥≤Áï∞Áâ©Âøó, \\"Record of Strange Things of the Southern Continent\\") or Nanfang yiwu zhi (ÂçóÊñπÁï∞Áâ©Âøó, \\"Record of Strange Things of the South\\") was written by Wan Zhen (Ëê¨Èúá), and may have been one of Ji Han's sources for his book. Ji Han's Nanfang caomu zhi (\\"Record of Southern Plants and Trees\\") title is sometimes confused with the (c. 3rd-4th century) Nanfang caowu zhi (ÂçóÊñπËçâÁâ©ÁãÄ, \\"Record of Southern Plants and Products\\"), which was written by a less well-known person, whose name is written Xu Zhong (ÂæêË°∑) or Xu Biao (ÂæêË°®). In order to explain the confusion of these caomu (\\"plants and trees\\") and caowu (\\"plants and products\\") titles, Needham, Lu, and Huang (1986: 450) compare this almost- identically named parallel work with noise in communication systems. For instance, an early Chinese book on agriculture, Jia Sixie's (Ë≥àÊÄùÂã∞, c. 540) Qimin Yaoshu was fond of quoting the Nanfang caowu zhi, as were others later, often giving Nanfang caomu zhi as the title. But since none of the Xu Zhong quotations can be found in the work of Ji Han as it has come down to us, some scholars supposed the two books to have been one and the same. Modern scholarship has shown that the two books were quite distinct. In contrast to Ji Han's \\"refinement\\", Xu Zhong's style is \\"plain and rather repetitive\\". There are five cases of the same plant being described by both authors, and then the entries are generally quite different; but the Nanfang caowu zhi was never a flora, for it included marine animals and all kinds of natural products (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 451). The (early 19th century) Xu nanfang caomu zhi (Á∫åÂçóÊñπËçâÊú®ÁãÄ \\"Supplement to the Record of Southern Plants and Trees\\"), written by Jiang Fan (Ê±üËó©), is an independent study rather than a supplement to Ji Han's book. It contains brief notes on 42 plants in Guangdong (Li 1979: 30). Sample entries plantains, Red, Latundan, and Cavendish bananas.|alt=Photo of four several large green, smaller red, very small yellow, and medium-sized yellow bananas The best way to elucidate the Nanfang caomu zhuang text is to provide some noteworthy entries for bananas, Chinese spinach, oranges, and \\"herb ferment\\". Banana The GƒÅnjiƒÅo (ÁîòËïâ, lit. \\"sweet banana/plantain\\") \\"banana, Musa paradisiaca, Musa sapientum\\" entry distinguishes two kinds of dessert-banana plants and one fiber-banana plant. > The Kan-chiao, seen from afar, resembles a tree. The larger plants are over > one armspan in circumference. The leaves are ten feet long, or sometimes > seven to eight feet and over one to almost two feet broad. The flowers are > as big as a wine cup, with the shape and color of a lotus. Over one hundred > pods are attached together at the end of the stem, called a fang (Êàø, > spathe). They are sweet and palatable and can also be preserved in honey. > The roots resemble taro, the largest as big as a carriage wheel. Fruiting > follows flowering, and the flowers, which have a cluster of six pods each, > develop successively. The pods are not formed simultaneously and the flowers > do not drop at the same time. It is also called Pa-chiao Ëä≠Ëïâ or Pa-ch√º Â∑¥Ëã¥. > Removing the peel of the pod, the yellowish-white interior with a taste like > the grape appears, sweet and soft. It satisfies hunger also. There are three > kinds. The kind with pods the size of a thumb, long and pointed, resembling > a sheep's horn in shape, is called Yang-chiao-chiao ÁæäËßíËïâ (sheep's horn > banana), and is the sweetest and most delicious in taste. Another kind with > pods the size of a hen's egg and resembling a cow's udder is called Niu-ju- > chiao Áâõ‰π≥Ëïâ (cow's udder banana), and is slightly inferior to Yang-chiao- > chiao. A third kind is the size of a lotus rootstock; the pods are six to > seven inches in length, squarish in shape, not sweet, and considered the > most inferior. The stem is separable into fibers, and when treated with > lime, can be woven into thin cloth, called Chiao-ko ËïâËëõ (banana linen). > Although the cloth is soft and good and yellowish-white in color, it is not > comparable to the reddish linen. The plant grows in both Chiao and Kuang. > According to the San-fu huang-t'u ‰∏âËºîÈªÉÂúñ, \\"Wu Ti of Han, in the sixth year of > the Y√ºan-ting period (111 B.C.), conquered Nan-y√ºeh and built the Fu-Ii > Palace to plant the rare plants and strange trees obtained. There are two > plants Kan-chiao.\\" (1, tr. Li 1979: 32-33) This detailed description is of great interest for botanists (Needham and Kuhn 1988: 49), but closer observation would have shown that the six fruits in a half-spiral did not come from one ovary (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 453). Since banana plants are all sterile hybrid cultigens, species differentiation is problematic. Musa √ó paradisiaca includes the previously differentiated M. paradisiaca \\"cooking/fiber banana; plantain\\" and M. sapientum \\" dessert banana\\". Judging from the Nanfang caomu zhuang account, the two y√°ngji«éojiƒÅo (ÁæäËßíËïâ \\"ram's horn banana\\") and ni√∫r«îjiƒÅo (Áâõ‰π≥Ëïâ \\"cow's milk banana\\") were of the edible sapientum type, and the unnamed third was of the fibrous paradisiaca type. XiƒÅngjiƒÅo (È¶ôËïâ \\"fragrant banana\\") is the common name in Modern Standard Chinese usage. The most surprising thing is the emphasis placed on the banana as a fiber plant (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 453), and the oldest occurrences of the word jiao mention no fruit, but only the value of the fiber and the cloth. The (121 CE) Shuowen jiezi first recorded the Chinese character jiƒÅo (Ëïâ \\"plantain; banana\\"), which combines the \\"plant radical\\" (Ëâ∏) and a jiƒÅo (ÁÑ¶ \\"burnt; scorched\\") phonetic, defined as (ÁîüÊû≤, lit. \\"living/raw male hemp- nettle\\") translated \\"raw plant fiber\\" (Reynolds 1940: 165) or \\"natural nettle- hemp\\" (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 453). Zuo Si's (c. 270) \\"Wudu fu\\" (Âê≥ÈÉΩË≥¶ \\"Rhapsody on the Wu capital\\", i.e., Suzhou) mentions jiƒÅog√© (ËïâËëõ \\"linen made from banana/plantain fibers\\") but not the fruit. Needham, Lu, and Huang (1986: 453) say that the banana was primarily a textile-producer, rather than cultivated for fruit, which could reasonably explain the origin of the name, for jiƒÅo (ÁÑ¶) means \\"heat; burning; boiling\\", which was how the stems had to be treated with lime water to get the fibers. This entry quotes the Sanfu huangtu (‰∏âËºîÈªÉÂúñ \\"Description of palace buildings in [the Han capital] Chang'an\\"), which is an anonymous text of uncertain date, estimated at from the 3rd century (Reynolds 1940: 166) to the 8th century (Ma 1978: 231), says: > In the sixth year of Y√ºan-ting [i.e., 111 B. C.] of the reign of Emperor Wu > of the Han Dynasty, Annam was vanquished. The palace Fu-li kung Êâ∂ËçîÂÆÆ [so > named on account of its lichee plants] was built [in Ch'ang-an, the national > capital] for transplanting the newly acquired plants ... among which were > ... twelve plants of the kan-chiao, etc. ... Because the climates of the > North and the South are different, most of the plants soon died. (tr. > Reynolds 1940: 166) Parts of this Nanfang caomu zhuang banana entry are almost identical with passages in earlier and later texts. The Nanfang caomu zhuang source could have been the (2nd-3rd century) Yiwu zhi or (3rd century) Nanzhou yiwu zhi; and it could have been copied into the (3rd-4th century) Nanfang caowu zhi and (4th-5th century) Guang zhi (Âª£Âøó). Yang Fu's Yiwu zhi gives this description. > Pa-chiao has leaves as large as mats. Its stem is like a [bamboo] shoot. > After boiling, the stem breaks into fibres and can be used for weaving > cloth. Women weavers make this fibre into fine or coarse linen which is > known now as chiao-chih [Cochin-China] linen. The center of the plant is > shaped like a garlic-bulb and is as large as a plate[?]. There the fruit > grows and holds the 'stem.' One stem bears several tens of fruits. The fruit > has a reddish skin like the color of fire and when peeled the inside pulp is > dark. The pulp is edible and is very sweet, like sugar or honey. Four or > five of these fruits are enough for a meal. After eating, the flavor lingers > on among the teeth. Kan-chiao is another name for it. (tr. Reynolds 1940: > 167) The Nanfang caomu zhuang has another entry (9) for an unidentified shuijiao (Ê∞¥Ëïâ \\"water banana\\") that \\"resembles the day-lily, and is either purple or yellow\\", which Li (1979: 44) suggests might be Lycoris. Chinese spinach Ipomoea aquatica water spinach The Nanfangcao mu zhuang entry for yongcai (ËïπËëâ \\"Ipomoea aquatica; Chinese spinach; water spinach; swamp cabbage\\") is the first record of both this vegetable and of floating gardens. Chinese spinach is a semi-aquatic tropical plant grown, either in water or on wet ground, as a vegetable for its tender shoots and leaves. In southern China it is a very common and popular vegetable, and often escapes from cultivation (Li 1979: 71). > The Yung has leaves resembling the Lo-k'uei ËêΩËëµ but smaller in size. The > nature is cold and the taste sweet. The southerners make rafts by weaving > reeds, cutting into the raft small holes and floating it above the water. > When seeds are planted in the water, they float above the water like > duckweeds. When grown, the stems and leaves rise above the holes in the > raft, which undulates with the water. This is a strange vegetable of the > south. Yeh-ko ÂÜ∂Ëëõ has deadly poison. If juice of the Yung is dropped on the > shoot of the latter, it withers instantly. According to traditions, Wei-wu > È≠èÊ≠¶ could eat Yeh-ko up to one foot in length. It is said that this is > possible because he ate the vegetable first. (25, tr. Li 1979: 71) Wei Wu (È≠èÊ≠¶ \\"[Emperor] Wu of Wei\\") is the posthumous name of Cao Cao (155-220), the penultimate Chancellor of the Eastern Han dynasty and founder of the Cao Wei dynasty (220-265). These plant references are lu√≤ku√≠ (ËêΩËëµ lit. \\"falling malva\\") Basella alba or redvine spinach and yƒõg√© (ÂÜ∂Ëëõ lit. \\"smelting kudzu\\") Gelsemium elegans or heartbreak grass.

If not discovered quickly and treated with an antidote, the one poisoned will die within half a day.\\" Gelsemium roots contain the highly toxic alkaloid gelsemine, which acts as a paralytic and often results in death. Later Chinese works repeatedly mention using Chinese spinach as an antidote for Gelsemium, and in India, the juice of this plant is believed to have emetic properties and is used in opium poisoning (Li 1979: 72). Chinese floating gardens are called fƒìngti√°n (ËëëÁî∞ \\"wild-rice fields\\") or ji√†ti√°n (Êû∂Áî∞ \\"frame fields\\"). Many texts, such as Xu Guangqi's (1693) Nongzheng chuanshu (Ëæ≤ÊîøÂÖ®Êõ∏ \\"Complete Treatise on Agricultural Administration\\"), refer to floating gardens (Li 1979: 15-16). Wang Zhen's (1313) Nongshu (Ëæ≤Êõ∏ \\"Treatise on Agriculture\\") describes wooden instead of reed rafts as Ji Han mentions. Wang Zhen explains that the frame is like a f√° (Á≠è \\"[bamboo] raft\\"), and that fƒìng means the roots of the aquatic plant g≈´ (ÁÆõ Zizania latifolia, Manchurian wild rice). He says that floating fields are found more or less everywhere in Southeast China, and quotes a poem by Su Dongpo that describes floating fields on the West Lake at Hangzhou: \\"'The water drains away, the wild grass sprouts, and gradually a [fengtian] appears\\" (tr. Needham and Bray 1964: 119). The chinampas, which have been used by the Aztecs on shallow lakes in the Valley of Mexico since the Middle Postclassic period (1150-1350), are the best-known floating gardens (technically, artificial islands separated by canoe-width channels). Several countries in Asia have actual floating gardens. In China, they are found not only in the Huai and Yangtze River area but also on Dian Lake in the Yunnan‚ÄìGuizhou Plateau. Floating fields are also found on Kasumigaura, Ibaraki in Japan, Dal Lake in Kashmir (West 1950), and Inle Lake in Myanmar (Needham and Bray 1964: 121). Oranges The Nanfang caomu zhuang has two entries (62 and 63) for Citrus trees: J√∫ (Ê©ò Citrus √ó sinensis, Sweet Orange) and GƒÅn (Êüë Citrus reticulata, Mandarin Orange). > The Ch√º has white flowers and reddish fruits which have fragrant petals and > a delicious taste. Since the time of Wu Ti of Han, there was a Minister of > Oranges with a salary of two hundred shih [of rice], responsible for > presenting oranges to the royal court. In the Huang-wu period of Wu (A.D. > 222-229), Shih Hsieh Â£´ÁáÆ, the Governor of Chiao-chih, once presented an > orange specimen with seventeen fruits to one stalk, considered as a symbol > of auspiciousness. The entire court entourage presented their > congratulations. (62, tr. Li 1979: 118) Shi Xie (137-226) was a Han dynasty Administrator of Jiaozhi commandery (present-day northern Vietnam). This story about Shi Xie sending as tribute a sweet orange plant with seventeen fruits to Sun Quan (r. 229-252), the founder of the Eastern Wu dynasty, is not recorded elsewhere, and Ma (1978: 243) believes it is a forgery based on the (492-493) Songshu history record that in 33I Yu Liang sent a sweet orange plant with twelve fruits to the Jin dynasty court. Li (1979: 119) notes that the Yiwu Zhi (quoted in the Qimin yaoshu) may possibly be the original source for this Nanfang caomu zhuang entry: \\"the orange tree has white flowers and reddish fruits, which have fragrant peels and also sweet taste. It is produced in Kiangnan and not elsewhere\\". The Taiping Yulan quotes this same passage followed by an additional sentence: \\"There is an orange grove in Chiao-chih, where an administrative officer is installed, with a salary of 300 shih (picul) [of rice], who is responsible for presenting an annual tribute of oranges to the royal court.\\" Nest construction by Oecophylla smaragdina workers > The Kan is a kind of orange with an exceptionally sweet and delicious taste. > There are yellow and red kinds. The red ones are called Hu-kan Â£∫Êüë (jar > orange). In the market, the natives of Chiao-chih sell ants stored in bags > of rush mats. The nests are like thin silk. The bags are all attached to > twigs and leaves, which, with the ants inside the nests, are for sale. The > ants are reddish-yellow in color, bigger than ordinary ants. In the south, > if the Kan trees do not have this kind of ant, the fruits will all be > damaged by many harmful insects and not a single fruit will be perfect. > There are now two trees of Kan in the Hua-lin Garden. When in fruit, the > Emperor has the court entourage wine and dine by their side and the fruits > are picked and given to all. (63, tr. Li 1979: 118-119) H√∫gƒÅn (Â£∫Êüë) is now called p√®nggƒÅn (Ê§™Êüë Citrus poonensis, ponkan, Chinese honey orange\\"). Ma (1978: 243-244) says the first few sentences appear Zhou Chu's (236-297) Fengtuji (È¢®ÂúüË®ò \\"Record of Local Conditions\\"), which is the likely source for this Nanfang caomu zhuang entry. Both Duan Chengshi's (9th century) Yuyang zalu (ÈÖâÈôΩÈõú‰øé) and the (early 10th century) Lingbiao luyi (Â∂∫Ë°®ÈåÑÁï∞) retell the citrus ant story. A number of scholars say this Nanfang caomu zhuang mandarin orange entry is the first reference in any literature to the entomological control of plant pests (e.g., Needham and Wang 1954: 118, Li 1979: 120), as well as the earliest example of a biological control agent as an article of commerce (Huang and Yang 1987: 66). The arboreal \\"citrus ant\\", Oecophylla smaragdina, Chinese hu√°ngjƒ´ngy«ê (ÈªÉÁåÑËüª \\"yellow fear ant\\"), is a weaver ant that binds leaves and twigs together with silk to form tight nests in a tree. At night, the citrus ants retire into these nests, and during the day, they leave the nests and forage for various insects that attack the orange trees and their fruit. To take advantage of these ants, a citrus grower secures a nest on one tree, then connects it to adjacent trees with bamboo strips for bridges, enabling the citrus ants to travel to and build new nests in neighboring trees, and eventually colonize the whole orchard. In 1915, the United States Department of Agriculture sent plant physiologist Walter Tennyson Swingle to China for research in varieties of orange resistant to citrus canker. In collaboration with George W. Groff and his students at Lingnan University in Guangzhou (Groff and Howard 1925), they became the first Western scientists to encounter the cultivated citrus ant of southern China. Herb ferment The C«éoq≈´ (ËçâÈ∫¥, lit. \\"herb ferment\\") entry in the Nanfang caomu zhuang is the earliest description of wine production using a natural ferment made with rice flour and herbs. In Southern Chinese tradition, this special rice wine was prepared in advance for marriage ceremonies while the daughter was still young. The traditional fermentation starter for Chinese wine is called ji«îq≈´ (ÈÖíÈ∫¥ \\"wine ferment\\", compounding ji«î \\"wine; liquor\\" and q≈´ \\"leaven; yeast\\") or ji«îy√†o (ÈÖíËó• \\"wine medicament\\", with y√†o \\"drug; medicine\\"), which is produced by inoculating a cereal dough with a previously-grown microbial culture (Needham and Huang 2000: 183). Yeast in winemaking is divided between natural, ambient wild yeast (such as caoqu) and cultured inoculated yeast (such as jiuqu). > In Nan-hai there are many fine wines, prepared not with yeast leaven but by > pounding rice flour mixed with many kinds of herb leaves and soaked in the > juice of Yeh-ko ÂÜ∂Ëëõ. The dough, as big as an egg, is left in dense bushes > under the shade. After a month, it is done, and is used to mix with > glutinous rice to make wine. Thus if drunk heavily, even after awakening > from intoxication, the head is hot and sweaty because there are poisonous > herbs in it. Among the southerners, when a daughter reaches several years of > age the family starts to brew wine on a large scale. After straining, and > when the ponds become dry in the winter, the wine is put in jars, tightly > sealed at the top and buried in the side of the ponds. When spring comes and > the ponds are full of water, these jars are not removed. When the daughter > is getting ready to be married, the pond edges are dug to remove the wine > for use in feasting the guests at the marriage ceremony. It is called > \\"girl's wine.\\" The taste is exceedingly fine. (14, tr. Li 1979: 59) Nanhai (ÂçóÊµ∑ \\"south sea\\", in Guangzhou) was the capital of the ancient Jiaozhou province. Yƒõg√© (ÂÜ∂Ëëõ) Gelsemium elegans or Heartbreak grass is a famous poisonous plant of southern China. Besides this \\"herb ferment\\" entry mentioning yege, the Nanfang caomu zhuang has a yege entry (26), and mentions it in the Chinese spinach entry (25, see above). Li (1979: 60) notes that while the root contains poison, it is not clear whether caoqu used the leaves or the roots. N«öji«î (Â•≥ÈÖí lit. \\"women wine\\") first appears in the Zhouli ritual text meaning \\"female slave winemaker\\" who (in yin and yang gender separation) made wines for women in the royal palace, the staff of the Superintendent of Wines is said to include 10 eunuchs, 30 \\"wine-women\\", and 300 convicts (tr. Manjo 1991: 236). Needham and Huang (2000: 261) suggest that since it took one month or the herbal rice-flour dough to become infected by fungi (presumably mycelia), the process was probably not easily reproducible in areas outside South China. The tradition of preparing wines for marriage ceremonies while the daughter was still young continued in the Shaoxing region of Zhejiang province until at least the early 20th century. Shaoxing wine is a famous variety of huangjiu fermented from rice, and it originated in Shaoxing, an ancient city in the southern Yue kingdom during the Warring States period. Qu Dajun's (17th century) Guangdong xinyu (Âª£Êù±Êñ∞Ë™û) confirmed that caoqu \\"herb ferment\\" was still used in the Guangdong area, and it was made from beans and rice mixed with plant materials such as shƒÅnji√© (Â±±Ê°î Glycosmis citrifolia)), l√†li«éo (Ëæ£Ëìº Persicaria hydropiper), and m«éli«éo (È¶¨Ëìº Persicaria lapathifolia) (Li 1979: 60). Authenticity Academic controversies over the authenticity of Ji Han's Nanfang caomu zhuang been ongoing for over a century. The first scholar to question the text's authenticity was Wen Dingshi (ÊñáÂª∑Âºè, 1856-1904), who said Ji Han could not have been the author because the theriac entry (19, tr. Li 1979: 64) says the physician Liu Juanzi (ÂäâÊ∂ìÂ≠ê, fl. 410), \\"used this plant to prepare pills and after taking them, attained immortality\\"; which is likely a copyist's mistake for the Daoist Juanzi (Ê∂ìÂ≠ê) mentioned in the (c. 1st century BCE) Liexian Zhuan (Ma 1978: 234). There is no reference to the Nanfang caomu zhuang in Ji Han's Book of Jin biography, nor in the bibliographies of the (636) Book of Sui or (945) Old Book of Tang, both of which do mention his collected works. The Nanfang caomu zhuang title is first recorded in Tang Shenwei's (ÂîêÊÖéÂæÆ, 1108) Zhenglei bencao (Ë≠âÈ°ûÊú¨Ëçâ) and You Mou's (Â∞§Ë¢§, 1180) Suichutang shumu (ÈÅÇÂàùÂ†ÇÊõ∏ÁõÆ). The oldest extant edition is in the (1273) Baichuan xuehai (ÁôæÂ∑ùÂ≠∏Êµ∑), printed by Zuo Gui (Â∑¶Âú≠). On one side of the debate, Ma (1978: 246) concludes the Nanfang caomu zhuang is unequivocally a forgery, compiled sometime between 1108, the year the Zhenglei bencao was first published, and 1194, the year You Mou died. On the other side, Needham, Lu, and Huang conclude (1986: 450) that basically Ji Han's \\"text is authentic, though there may have been some later interpolations.\\" Li (1979: 11-12) lists internal evidence that attests the historical validity of the Nanfang caomu zhuang text, or at least the major part of it. First, Ji Han used archaic and unusual names for certain plants instead of those which later became standard in the Tang and Song, for instance (45), jishexiang (ÈõûËàåÈ¶ô) instead of dingxiang (‰∏ÅÈ¶ô) for cloves, indicating the antiquity of the text. Second, he wrote eight entries describing plants that later authors have never been able to identify. Third, Ji Han was occasionally confused regarding some plants where later botanists were not, for example (17), he mixed up Phrynium with Zingiber. Fourth, he mentions contemporary events, such as Aquilaria bark-paper (56) being presented as tribute to Emperor Wu of Jin in 284. Li (1979: 13) concludes that although we cannot rule out the possibility of interpolations, we can be reasonably sure that the text, as it has come down to us in its present form since the late Song period, \\"represents on the whole a historically trustworthy account of the plants treated therein as they appeared in the southern regions around the third and fourth centuries\\". Huang Xingzong's (1986) summary of the proceedings at an international symposium on the authenticity of the Nanfang caomu zhuang provides an overview of both sides in the debate: those who claim that the text is a 12th-century forgery compiled from early texts, and those who consider it a genuine 4th-century work with later interpolations. In the first category of bibliographical evidence (Huang 1986: 73), some argued at the symposium that there is no reason to believe that the Nanfang caomu zhuang existed before the Song dynasty when the title first appeared, and when it did occur in pre-Song literature, it was often called the Nanfang caowu zhuang. Others responded that lack of citation in the dynastic histories, which was a common occurrence in Chinese literary history, does not necessarily mean that the book did not exist. Since Ji Han's preface explicitly said the book was compiled for the edification of his family, and not intended for public dissemination, it is not surprising that for generations its existence was not well known. Furthermore, there are unanswered questions (Huang 1986: 73). If the text suddenly first appeared in the Song dynasty, why did it not arouse the suspicion of learned bibliophiles? What would a forger gain by spending the time and effort necessary to compile such an admirable text but not accepting its authorship? Huang says the most reasonable hypothesis is that the Nanfang caomu zhuang appearance in a printed edition did not attract any special attention because it was common knowledge among the Song literati that Ji Han wrote the text in the 4th century. In the second category of textual comparisons, there are numerous Nanfang caomu zhuang passages that are similar or identical to those on the same topics in other classical works about South China. Ma (1978) identified passages in books written between the 3rd and 12th centuries as \\"sources\\" for many Nanfang caomu zhuang entries, for example, the Yiwu zhi was a probable sources for the banana and orange descriptions. Ma claimed that at least thirteen entries were copied from (early 10th century) Lingbiao luyi (Â≤≠Ë°®ÈåÑÁï∞), and seven from (875) Beihulu (ÂåóÊà∂ÈåÑ). Symposium scholars who rejected this plagiarism hypothesis contended that it is more reasonable to conclude that the \\"sources\\" were themselves copied from the Nanfang caomu zhuang without acknowledgement, as early Chinese authors so often did. Furthermore, Hui-lin Li gave the entries on wild ginger (5) and chinkapin (73) as convincing examples. In the Nanfang caomu zhuang the descriptions make botanical sense, but the corresponding entries in Lingbiao luyi, though almost identical in language, lack one or two key words needed to render them botanically meaningful, thus indicating that the Nanfang caomu zhuang author had an intimate knowledge of plants and knew what he was writing about, whereas the Lingbiao luyi compiler was copying blindly from the older text. In the third category of philological considerations, several discrepancies in book titles, personal names, and historical events quoted in the Nanfang caomu zhuang have led scholars in China and the West to question its authenticity (Huang 1986: 75-76). Jasmine (yeximing ËÄ∂ÊÇâËåó, from Arabic yasmin) and sambac (moli ËåâËéâ, from Sanskrit mallikƒÅ), according to the Beihulu, were introduced from Persia in 536, and therefore, could not have been known to Ji Han. In rebuttal, scholars cited evidence that jasmine was already well known in central China during the Jin dynasty, thus the mistake was in the Beihulu, and not in the Nanfang caomu zhuang. The symposium participants reached consensus that the extant text contains interpolations by later writers, and probably first appeared in its current form during the Southern Song dynasty. Among the pro-forgery group, opinions about the date of fabrication varied considerably, perhaps Tang, Northern Song, or Southern Song. Huang (1986: 77) says, \\"Based on what is known about Ji Han's life, his literary attainments, his love of plants, and his interest in alchemy, those opposed to the forgery thesis believe that he is a likely author for the Nanfang caomu zhuang.\\" Sources *√Ögren, Hans (1983), \\"Review [of Li 1979]\\", The British Journal for the History of Science 16.2: 212-213. *Bretschneider, Emil (1870), On the Study and Value of Chinese Botanical Works, with notes on the history of plants and geographical botany from Chinese sources, Foochow. *Groff, George W. and C.

She conducted postgraduate work in optical crystallography at Claremont College in 1930 and later studied chemical spectroscopy in 1937 at New York University. In 1940, she studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and received her PhD in chemistry from the University of Colorado in 1942. She pioneered the study of ceramic petrography in the United States, determining the provenance of painted vessels from sites throughout the Southwest. She demonstrated that Ancestral Puebloans, specifically women, produced pottery on a large scale for trade throughout the region. She also analyzed Maya blue pigments, as well as glazed plumbate pottery from the Postclassic period in Mexico. Her book, Ceramics for the Archaeologist, published in 1956, still serves as a comprehensive reference for archaeologists today.

In 2004, Amaral helped the Supra claim their first piece of silverware by clinching the Eastern Conference title, and finished as the league's second highest goalscorer with 15 goals. For his efforts he was awarded the Canadian Soccer League MVP Award. After failing to secure a postseason berth in 2005, Amaral took a sabbatical for two seasons and returned for the 2008 season. In 2008, he helped Portugal FC (new franchise name for Toronto Supra) qualify for the postseason, and contributed by scoring a goal in a 2-1 victory over Toronto Croatia. Unfortunately their playoff run came to an end with a 7-0 defeat to Trois-Rivi√®res Attak.  Managerial career  In 2009, he announced his retirement and was appointed the new head coach for Portugal FC. Throughout the season he would occasionally play the dual role of player/coach for the club. He managed to clinch the final postseason berth for Portugal FC, but were defeated in the quarterfinals by Trois-Rivieres Attak by a score of 4-0 on goals on aggregate. In 2017, he began managing at the indoor level as a head coach for Portugal AC in the Arena Premier League.

Flax matures in approximately 90 to 125 days and develops most rapidly under the cool, short season of growing. The middle hill region of the Lamjung district (the epicenter of the earthquake devastating Nepal in April 2015) exemplifies an ideal climate for flax production experiencing consistently cool temperatures for most of the year.Schroeder, R. (1985). Himalayan Subsistence Systems: Indigenous Agriculture in Rural Nepal. Mountain Research and Development, 5(1), 31.Gentle, P., Thwaites, R., Race, D., & Alexander, K. (2014). Differential impacts of climate change on communities in the middle hills region of Nepal. Nat Hazards, 74(2), 815-836. The shallow rooting system makes the plant especially susceptible to drought and excess moisture in the soil but easier to harvest.Booker, H., Bueckert, R., Duguid, S., Gavloski, J., Rob Gulden, R., & Dueck, R. et al. (2006). Growing Flax ‚Äì Production, Management & Diagnostic Guide (5th ed.). St. Walburg, Saskatchewan: FCC, SFDC. Most cash crops are grown in the hill regions of Nepal as this is where two-thirds of the subsistence farmers reside, who need to produce just enough food to feed themselves and their families.  Production  Oilseed production in Nepal was largely replaced by grain crops which contain a higher caloric value but requires higher labor and overall decrease in nutritional quality for the Nepalese. Flax production is seen to be increasing as Nepal's reported yields in 2012 are 5000 hectograms per hectare (Hg/Ha) and 5358 Hg/Ha in 2013 referring to a production quantity of 7500 tons and 7672 tons respectively.Faostat.fao.org. (2013). FAOSTAT. Retrieved 24 November 2015. The cool and temperate climate of the mid-hill regions in Nepal present great potential for farmers to maximize their linseed yields and the yield of proceeding cash-crops through disease and pest control. The hill regions of the Lamjung district is less than 170 km from the capital of Nepal, Kathmandu, which represents an ideal market for trading of the flax seeds or any by- products of the crop made by Nepalese farmers and their families.Kathmandu 44600, Nepal to Sundarbazar, Nepal. (2015). Kathmandu 44600, Nepal to Sundarbazar, Nepal. Retrieved 23 November 2015, from https://www.google.ca/maps/ thumbnail Graphed data from http://faostat.fao.org/  Benefits of flax production   Crop rotation  Entering flax into the crop rotation reduces the prevalence of disease and pests as flax varieties are less susceptible to diseases such as Sclerotinia stem rot, flea beetles, and certain species of Fusarium that devastate cereal crops. Further use of flax production will increase the yields of other grain crash crops and provide Nepalese farmers with by-products for personal use or sale.  Whole flax straw  Whole flax straw holds great agricultural value to subsistence farmers. When left on the field, the straw will protect the soil from wind and water erosion and can be used as livestock bedding or mulch. Due to the topography of hills and mountains, run-off and erosion is of concern. Whole flax straw can help to alleviate and reduce the occurrence of this erosion. Additionally, remnants of straw and fiber remaining on the soil will return nutrients to the soil, increasing soil fertility and, in turn, increasing future cash crop yields. Lastly, deforestation for fuel use is an ongoing issue in Nepal. By-products of flax harvest are used as a biofuel source in Canada; this methodology can be transposed in Nepal and lessen the need for the hill and mountain farmers to scavenge for wood-sourced fuels.  Flax fiber  There is world market demand for flax straw and fiber in environmentally friendly products, textiles, and biofuel. Farmers often maximize their cash returns in producing quality seed and neglect the production of whole straw and fiber‚Äì‚Äìan excellent opportunity for Nepalese farmers to fill the niche market. Flax fiber can be used in textiles such as linen and cottonized flax, in pulp sweeteners, and insulation, where there is remarkable demand. Environmentally-friendly products are becoming more and more popular around the world. For example, plastic composites using flax fibers are continuing to become more popular in the modern world's automotive industry. Productions of composites require less energy than fiberglass to process and manufacture which results in a lighter vehicle that is more efficient.Foulk, J. A., Akin, D. E., Dodd, R. B., & McAlister, D. D. (2002). Flax fiber: potential for a new crop in the Southeast. Trends in new crops and new uses. ASHS Press, Alexandria, VA, 361-370.  Shive  Shive is the non- fibre parts of the stem and comprises anywhere from 70-85% of the total straw weight and therefore a major by-product of flax straw processing. It is destined for use in bio-fuel, mulch and animal bedding.  Nutrition  Flaxseed oil is high in alpha linoleic fatty acid (ALA) of which is important to human and animal nutrition. The flaxseed itself can be consumed by the general population. With its short maturation period and self-pollination, the crop can produce multiple cuts of straw and seeds. A versatile crop, flaxseed can be used in breads and cereals as well as oil for supplementation as it is a great source of micronutrients, ALA, and fiber.Zuk, M., Richter, D., Matu≈Ça, J., & Szopa, J. (2015). Linseed, the multipurpose plant. Industrial Crops and Products, 75, 165-177.  Potential drawbacks of flax production   Harvest  Harvesting whole flax straw and fiber can be a challenge. Whole flax straw is historically left in the field to decay over time or raked into piles and burned as it tends to clog farm equipment and thus makes collection difficult. As a result, harvest and post-harvest labor may be lengthy and time-consuming if the straw and fibers are constantly clogging the discs of the plow.  Transport and storage  Another challenge is the transport and storage of flaxseed once harvested. Purchasing price from manufacturers and processing plants is largely dependent on quality (there are few grading guidelines established in Canada). Although the climactic regions of Nepal are ideal for flax production, spoilage may be an issue with increased temperatures and humidity that may be associated with transport and time of season. Transporting the materials to Canada will come as a cost deduction in spot price to Nepalese farmers; this may ultimately determine the profitability of the crop to the farmer.

Nihon is a member of the Kantoh Collegiate American Football Association. Nihon Phoenix football has been a powerhouse in Japan's college football along with the Kwansei Gakuin University Fighters for four decades.  Features  Nihon won the Japanese collegiate championships for 17 times including 5 in a row when Mikio Shinokake was the team's head coach. Shinokake adopted the shotgun formation as the team's basic offensive formation. He often had played the team's best athlete as a quarterback in the formation, and the qb played the dual role of qb and tailback. The strategy had worked very well because the size and the power of Japanese defenders had not been so big nor strong enough to injury the qb, making the defenders confused whether the qb throws the ball or keeps the ball for qb draw. Nihon sometimes used the Dragonfly formation which is a kind of the shotgun formation, and two quarterbacks are aligned at the same time in the formation. These qb's also play the dual role of qb and tailback, then it is almost the same as if four players were aligned in the backfield. Nihon scored two touchdowns using the formation against the College of William & Mary at the Ivy Bowl in 1993.  Controversy  The Nihon University Phoenix has played friendly exhibition games against the Kwansei Gakuin University Fighters for forty years, and during an exhibition match on May 6, 2018, a defensive player of Phoenix tackled a quarterback of Fighters from behind at least two seconds after throwing an incomplete-pass. The quarterback was forced to leave the game. Also, the defender committed three fouls in the match. However, he was in tears at the bench after substituted off. Just after the match, the Phoenix head coach commented on the defender's plays as if he approved of the fouls or encouraged the players to commit them. This dangerous illegal late-hit and the coach's comment stirred a national controversy. Ex-NFL line-backer Masafumi Kawaguchi pointed out that he'd never seen anything like the late-hit that became a problem. The Kwansei Gakuin University formally protested to the Nihon University, and accused Nihon of intentionally trying to hurt the quarterback. Daichi Suzuki, the chief of the government's Japan Sports Agency, launched an inquiry and called the play into question. The quarterback was damaged in his spine. The defender who injured him was obviously ordered to make dirty tackles by Nihon Phoenix coaches, and later admitted it in public according to his conscience. The head coach of Nihon, nevertheless, denied that he had ordered his players to play dirty and resigned as coach without giving veracity in explain. Anger spread in nation-wide. Reporters of New York Times speculated that this controversy related to deep-rooted cultural dynamics including what the Japanese call ‚Äúpower hara‚Äù.

Heavy metal bass is the use of the bass guitar (also called \\"electric bass\\") in the rock music genres of heavy metal and hard rock. The bassist is part of the rhythm section in a heavy metal band, along with the drummer, rhythm guitarist and, in some bands, a keyboard player. The prominent role of the bass is key to the metal sound, and the interplay of bass and distorted electric guitar is a central element of metal. The bass guitar provides the low-end sound crucial to making the music \\"heavy\\".Weinstein (2000), p. 24 The bass plays a \\"... more important role in heavy metal than in any other genre of rock.\\"Weinstein (2009), p. 24 Metal bassists play many different types of basslines, depending on the subgenre they are playing in and their personal playing style. Metal bass lines vary in complexity, from holding down a low pedal point as a foundation for the band's sound to doubling complex riffs and licks along with the lead guitar and/or rhythm guitars. Some bands feature the bass as a lead instrument, an approach popularized by Metallica's Cliff Burton with his emphasis on bass guitar solos and use of chords while playing bass in the early 1980s.\\"Cliff Burton's Legendary Career: The King of Metal Bass\\" . Bass Player, February 2005. Retrieved on November 13, 2007. Some metal bassists sing lead vocals while they play bass, such as Lemmy Kilmister of Mot√∂rhead and Tom Araya of Slayer. Some metal bassists sing backup vocals while they play bass. Roles and playing styles Bass guitarist Ian Hill from the heavy metal band Judas Priest. A red pick can be seen in his plucking hand. Most metal bassists play by plucking the strings with their fingers or by picking with a plectrum, often known as a pick. Using a pick can enable bassists to play rapid repeated notes and fast basslines, although some bassists, such as Steve Harris and Steve DiGiorgio, play such basslines without the use of a plectrum. While the types of bass lines vary in different metal subgenres, the bassist usually fulfills a similar role: anchoring the harmonic framework with bass notes that emphasize the roots of the chords and, along with the drums and rhythm guitar, establishing the beat. The bass is also used a solo instrument in some metal styles. While four-string basses (tuned E, A, D, G from lowest string to highest string) are the most common, since the 1990s, some metal bassists have used five-string basses for added lower range‚Äîa low \\"B\\". Five string basses are used in nu metal, as well as death metal, progressive metal and other heavy metal subgenres, to complement the downtuned guitars use by the guitarists. The five string bass is not an essential part to these genres, as some bands in these genres use standard tuned guitars or downtuned four string basses. Some bassists, such as John Myung from the progressive metal band Dream Theater, utilize a six string bass, which usually adds an additional high \\"C\\" above the \\"G\\" string of a five string bass. Most metal bassists play with fretted instruments, which have metal frets on the fingerboard. However, there are a few bassists such as Steve DiGiorgio and Jeroen Paul Thesseling who use fretless basses. Most of the time, metal bass players play basslines which consist of a single note played at a time; that is, without playing multiple notes at the same time to form chords, the way a rhythm guitarist would on an electric guitar. There are, however, a few metal bassists who play chords. Robert Trujillo of Metallica is known for playing \\"massive chords\\" Warwick Robert Trujillo Signature Bass. February 19, 2012 in basses, Featured by G.M.

Lemmy of Mot√∂rhead often played power chords in his bass lines. When asked about whether he had begun as a rhythm guitarist, he stated: > No, I play a lot of notes, but I also play a lot of chords. And I play a lot > of open strings. I just don't play like a bass player. There are complaints > about me from time to time. It's not like having a bass player; it's like > having a deep guitarist. Soloing While bass guitar solos are much less common in metal than guitar solos for electric guitar, some metal bassists do play solos. Bass guitar solos are structured and performed in a similar fashion as rock guitar solos, often with the musical accompaniment from the verse or chorus sections. Bass solos are performed using a range of different techniques, such as plucking or fingerpicking. A small number of metal bassists do two-handed tapping styles in which they use both hands to play notes on the fretboard by rapidly pressing and holding the string to the fret. Players noted for this soloing technique include Cliff Burton and shred guitar-style bassist Billy Sheehan. Led Zeppelin's \\"Good Times Bad Times\\", the first song on their first album, contains two brief bass solos, occurring after the song's first and third choruses. Queen's bassist, John Deacon, occasionally played bass solos, such as on the song \\"Liar\\". Metallica's 1983 debut Kill Em All includes the song \\"(Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth,\\" consisting entirely of a bass solo played by Cliff Burton. Manowar's bassist Joey DeMaio uses special piccolo bass for his extremely fast bass solos like \\"Sting of the Bumblebee\\" and \\"William's Tale\\". Heavy metal bass players such as Geezer Butler (Black Sabbath), Alex Webster (Cannibal Corpse), Cliff Burton (Metallica), and Les Claypool (Primus, Blind Illusion) have used chime-like harmonics and rapid plucking techniques in their bass solos. In both published Van Halen concert videos, Michael Anthony performs unique maneuvers and actions during his solos. When playing bass solos, rock and metal bassists sometimes use effects such as fuzz bass or a wah-wah pedal to produce a more pronounced sound. Notably, Cliff Burton of Metallica used both effects. Due to the lower range of the bass, bass guitar solos usually have a much lighter accompaniment than solos for other instruments. In some cases, the bass guitar solo is unaccompanied, or accompanied only by the drums. Training Steve Harris from Iron Maiden performing in 2008. There is much less formal training available in college and university for metal bass, the way there is for bass guitarists learning jazz and the mainstream commercial genres (rock, R&B;, etc.). Many metal bass players learn by ear, by copying bass lines from records and CDs, and by playing in a number of bands, which may include cover bands and tribute bands. Metal bassists may be able to take lessons from expert metal players or teachers. They may also be able to adapt techniques from other genres to the metal genre. As well, there are a range of books, playing methods, and, since the 1990s and 2000s, instructional DVDs and YouTube videos on how to play metal bass. Roles Metal bassists play in groups ranging in size from the power trio (guitar, bass and drums, with one or more of the members singing) to larger bands with multiple guitarists, keyboards, a bassist, a drummer and a vocalist. Some metal bassists sing lead vocals while they play bass, a role that Lemmy Kilminster of Mot√∂rhead did, and which Tom Araya of Slayer and Grutle Kjellson of Enslaved continue to do. Some metal bassists sing backup vocals while they play bass. Some metal bassists are also bandleaders or songwriters for their bands examples being Steve Harris and Nikki Sixx. In a few cases, traditional metal group bass players have also played another instrument, such as Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones, who played Hammond organ on some songs or the bassists from mainstream metal bands such as Styx and the Scorpions who use a pedal keyboard, which is played with the feet. Professional metal bassists may have a bass technician who tunes their basses before and during a performance, sets up the speaker cabinets, amplifiers and effects units, and performs routine maintenance on the instruments and equipment (e.g., changing strings, replacing speakers, replacing amplifier tubes, etc.). Role of women Talena Atfield of the Canadian metal band Kittie. In relation to the gender composition of heavy metal bands, it has been said that \\"[h]eavy metal performers are almost exclusively male\\" \\"... [a]t least until the mid-1980s\\" apart from \\"... exceptions such as Girlschool.\\" However, \\"... now [in the 2010s] maybe more than ever‚Äìstrong metal women have put up their dukes and got down to it\\",\\"carv[ing] out a considerable place for [them]selves.\\" Given that most heavy metal musicians are male, most metal bassists are male. Almost all of the most well-known metal bassists are male. Women have less roles in rock music genres like metal because the \\"... rebellion of rock music was largely a male rebellion.\\" Philip Auslander says that \\"Although there were many women in rock by the late 1960s, most performed only as singers, a traditionally feminine position in popular music\\". Though some women played instruments in American all-female garage rock bands, none of these bands achieved more than regional success. So they \\"did not provide viable templates for women's on-going participation in rock\\". When the female bassist and singer Suzi Quatro emerged in 1973, \\"no other prominent female musician worked in rock simultaneously as a singer, instrumentalist, songwriter, and bandleader\\". She was \\"kicking down the male door in rock and roll and proving that a female musician ... and this is a point I am extremely concerned about ... could play as well if not better than the boys\\". Notable women metal bassists include: *Jennifer Arroyo from the Canadian metal band Kittie *Talena Atfield (Kittie) *Jo Bench from the death metal band Bolt Thrower *Suzi Quatro (hard rock) *Jeanne Sagan from All That Remains and The Acacia Strain *Sean Yseult of White Zombie *Alla Fedynitch *Share Ross from Vixen *Gail Greenwood of L7 Equipment Basses Some metal bassists use unusually-shaped instruments, such as Gene Simmons from Kiss, who had an instrument custom made in the shape of an axe, or those who use instruments like ES Guitars' Avenger, which has a jagged design. Many metal bassists use electric basses that are used in other rock genres, such as the Fender Precision bass. Amplifiers and effects Heavy metal bassists use many different brands of bass amplifiers and speaker cabinets to make the instrument sound loud enough on stage. Bass players also use their amplifier's preamp, gain, overdrive (if present) and tone controls to create their unique personal bass sound. In some genres of music, such as folk and small combo jazz, the other instruments are often acoustic and so bass players in these styles may not need large, powerful bass amps. However, in heavy metal live performances, loudness‚Äîan \\"onslaught of sound,\\" in sociologist Deena Weinstein's description‚Äîis considered vital.Weinstein, p. 23 The need for a loud volume in metal bands is even more paramount in large performance venues, such as stadiums. To get a loud enough bass sound to compete with the loudly amplified electric guitars and the large drum kits used in metal, metal bassists typically use large bass speaker cabinets stacked on top of each other‚Äì\\"bass stacks\\"‚Äìpowered by high-wattage amplifiers. Traditional heavy metal bands were early users of \\"bass stacks\\". Bassist Alex Webster from the death metal band Cannibal Corpse plays with two 8x10 speaker cabinets (each cabinet contains eight 10\\" speakers). One early bass stack was the 300-watt Super Vacuum Tube (SVT) amplifier head, which was intended for large performance venues. The SVT was intended for use with one or two speaker cabinets containing eight 10\\" speakers. Some metal bassists use vacuum tube amplifiers, which were the dominant active electronic components in bass amplifiers manufactured until the early 1970s. Many bass players believe that tube amplifiers produce a \\"warmer\\" or more \\"natural\\" sound than solid state amplifiers when lightly or moderately overdriven, and more pleasing distortion characteristics when heavily overdriven. Some metal bassists play with a fuzz bass tone, which is obtained by overdriving the bass signal. Cliff Burton of Metallica used fuzz bass. Lemmy Kilmister, the bassist for Mot√∂rhead, obtains a natural fuzz bass tone by overdriving his twin 100 watt Marshall Bass stacks. Fuzz bass can also be obtained with a bass overdrive pedal or an \\"overdrive\\" or distortion effect built into their bass amp. The Peavey Century 200 has an onboard \\"distortion\\" effect on the second channel. The Peavey VB-2 also has built-in overdrive. Aguilar Amplification's AG 500 bass head is a two-channel amplifier, one of which offers a \\"saturation\\" control for overdrive. Metal bassists may also use other effects to alter their bass sound, such as a wah pedal (e.g., Cliff Burton) or an audio compressor to smooth out the sound.

At least of scrub and farmland in the council areas of Light, Wakefield, Clare and Gilbert Valleys, and Mallala were burned during its duration. On 25 November, during the major run of the Pinery fire, two fatalities occurred; Janet Hughes, 56, perished while fleeing in a vehicle outside Hamley Bridge; Allan Tiller, 69, perished while fighting the fire on a neighbour's property in Pinery itself. A further 90 people were hospitalized as a result of the fire, with five of the victims suffering critical injuries. The Pinery fire destroyed or rendered uninhabitable 91 houses, and completely destroyed 388 non-residential structures, 93 pieces of farm machinery and 98 other vehicles. It also caused significant damage to rural produce; 53,000 poultry and 17,500 head of livestock perished and up to A$40 million worth of fodder and unharvested grains were destroyed. Communities affected by the fire included Barabba, Daveyston, Freeling, Greenock, Hamley Bridge, Kapunda, Magdala, Mallala, Nain, Nuriootpa, Owen, Pinery, Pinkerton Plains, Redbanks, Roseworthy, Stockport, Tarlee, Templers, Wasleys and Woolsheds.  Climate and weather setting  Daily maximum temperatures were the highest on record for October in South Australia, averaging +5.61 ¬∞C above the mean. Daily rainfall records for November were observed across a large number of stations in the agricultural districts of South Australia on 4‚Äì5 November, with daily totals ranging from to over large areas; Tarlee observed a record falling on 5 November. Several communities within the eventual fire ground recorded their highest November rainfall in at least 30 years; Tarlee observed the wettest November since 1971, with . However, extremely low rainfall was observed after 5 November and prior to the fire; at Nuriootpa and at Roseworthy. The record rainfall in early November prompted growth of both agricultural crops and other plant material, which increased the fuel load across the fire ground. More plant material was present in the fire ground than later in the fire season, as the fire occurred during a spring harvest period with predicted wheat yields of near the long-term average. During the rest of November, this organic material quickly dried out as South Australia recorded mean temperatures in the warmest 10% of years, due in part to two high pressure systems that moved eastwards across southeastern Australia on 18‚Äì20 November and on 21‚Äì23 November. Large areas of the state recorded daily maximum temperatures of +12 ¬∞C above average during the passage of both systems; on 18 November, Roseworthy recorded and, on 19 November, Nuriootpa recorded .  Weather on 25 November  The day prior to ignition of the Pinery fire, the Country Fire Service issued a warning for \\"Extreme\\" fire conditions in the Mid-North and Mount Lofty Ranges and declared a total fire ban in both regions for 25 November. The weather conditions around the Pinery fire on 25 November have been described as \\"catastrophic\\"; sustained north-westerly winds of and reputed gusts of up to are believed to have fanned the fire front in a run of over in the first 4 hours. At Nuriootpa, the Bureau of Meteorology observed a maximum wind gust of from the northwest at 13:25 ACDT (UTC+10:30), the highest recording in November 2015. from the west-north-west at 13:31 ACDT (UTC+10:30) was the highest recorded wind speed at Roseworthy that month, and the relative humidity of 11% at 9:00 ACDT (UTC+10:30) was also the lowest that month. At approximately 15:00 ACDT (UTC+10:30) the fire ground was affected by a cold front that passed across the entirety of southern Australia. The fire had initially spread to the south-east on a long narrow front, and when the cold front caused the prevailing wind to change direction, the long eastern flank became a broad front and the fire spread rapidly to the east and north. The wind at Roseworthy was observed as having shifted to from the west-south-west, and the mean sea level pressure had fallen to a low of 999.4 at 15:00 ACDT (UTC+10:30).  Fire timeline  Around noon on 25 November, the Pinery fire was started by a spark from a car battery in a paddock bordering Plains Road and Port Lorne Road in the lower Mid North wheat-growing locality of Pinery, due north of Adelaide's centre. Shortly after noon, the first alert message for the Pinery fire was issued by the Country Fire Service, the fire burning west of Avon on Port Lorne Road. The warning was upgraded 10 minutes later to emergency level, with the fire burning in a south-easterly direction and impacting on properties around Mallala. According to a Pinery farmer who spoke to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Landline program, local farmers were \\"...confronted with two kilometres of 30-foot-high wall of flame.\\" An hour later the emergency warning area was expanded to include Magdala, Pinkerton Plains, Redbanks, Wasleys and Woolsheds as the fire moved in a south-easterly direction, and by 14:30 ACDT (UTC+10:30) the fire was impacting properties in the areas around Gawler, Hewett and Roseworthy. However, a wind change passed the fire ground at approximately 15:00 ACDT (UTC+10:30), causing the fire front to expand in a northerly direction, and by 15:17 ACDT (UTC+10:30) the fire was traveling in a north-easterly direction towards Barabba, Freeling, Greenock, Hamley Bridge, Kapunda, Nuriootpa, Owen and Tarlee. At 16:25 ACDT (UTC+10:30), the area placed under an emergency warning was expanded again to include Dutton, Eudunda, Marrabel and Riverton. A worker at a piggery between Wasleys and Mallala reportedly \\"...drove 120 kilometres per hour in one direction away from the fire, before seeing the wind swing around and having to double back in the opposite direction.\\" The man, who spoke to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation described \\"...flames taller than buildings\\". The members of three Country Fire Service brigades were trapped between Wasleys and Mallala during the wind change and sheltered in their vehicles during a burn over, however there were no injuries. At 21:30 ACDT (UTC+10:30) all warnings for the Pinery fire were downgraded to \\"watch and act\\", however the fire had already impacted directly on property as far north as Tarlee, as far east as Belvidere and as far south as Roseworthy. By 26 November, approximately 400 firefighters and 70 firefighting appliances had been deployed to fight the fire and both the Horrocks and Thiele Highways were closed to all but emergency traffic. On 2 December, eight days after ignition, all warnings for the fire ceased; the fire had burned property across a fire front of over . During the entire duration of the fire, at least 1,700 firefighters and volunteers were deployed, including a large interstate deployment of strike teams from Victoria's Country Fire Authority (CFA).  Aftermath  There were two human fatalities during the Pinery fire, both on the afternoon of 25 November. Janet Hughes, 56, was trapped in her car on Owen Road outside Hamley Bridge and died at the scene. Fellow residents believed Mrs. Hughes was attempting to reach her partner, who was at work in nearby Balaklava, when her car left the road and ignited. While assisting another man to defend a neighbor's property, Allan Tiller, 69, was overcome by the fire front in a Pinery paddock and died of his injuries at the scene. Significant damage was caused to numerous communities across an area in the council areas of Light, Wakefield, Clare and Gilbert Valleys, and Mallala. At least 91 houses were destroyed or rendered uninhabitable by fire damage during the Pinery fire, the vast majority during the initial six hours after ignition. In the town of Wasleys, a lawn bowls club and a post office were gutted by the fire. Also destroyed were 388 non-residential buildings, 98 vehicles and 93 pieces of farm machinery. Numerous civilian vehicles were destroyed along the Horrocks, Sturt and Thiele highways as people attempted to flee; approximately of roads and roads infrastructure‚Äîincluding bridges and signage‚Äîwere damaged or destroyed by the fire. The fire had a catastrophic impact upon the rural industry of Lower Mid North, Light River and west Barossa regions. A large quantity of livestock perished in the fire, including 53,600 poultry, 17,000 sheep, 500 pigs, 87 cattle, 19 horses and three Alpaca. Many of the livestock were buried in mass graves across the region. Approximately two-thirds of the area burned in the Pinery fire was estimated to have been paddocks and fields of produce; 120,000 tonnes of agricultural crops‚Äîincluding wheat, barley, canola, lentils and chickpeas‚Äîwith a value of up to A$40 million were destroyed. On 17 March 2016, winds of up to during a thunderstorm that passed over the fire ground created a dust storm, which affected towns in the mid- north of South Australia and in the Barossa Valley. Aid and recovery Those in the Light, Wakefield, Clare and Gilbert Valleys, and Mallala council areas who suffered loss or injury as a result of the fires were able to claim a one-off Disaster Recovery Payment and, in some cases, a 13-week Disaster Recovery Allowance, both provided by the State Government of South Australia. $A84,000 was donated by businesses and the community to the RSPCA, which then allocated the funds to the University of Adelaide's School of Animal and Veterinary Sciences and the Veterinary Health Centres to treat pets and livestock injured in the blaze.

The school offers English medium education and is affiliated to the Karnataka Secondary Education Examination Board. The school has classes from Year 1 to Year 10. In 1993, the United Mission Degree College was established on the same campus, offering Bachelor of Commerce and Bachelor of Business Management courses, affiliated to the Bangalore University. Wesleyan Mission Schools, Bangalore, 1832 Captain Woodward of the 32 NI, reporting on 4 November 1832, for a gathering of respectable residents of the Bangalore Civil and Military Station speaks of the existing Wesleyan Mission Schools at the Cantonment. The Bungalow schools had around 131 children, with 36 children (12 girls and 24 boys) being schooled in the Wesleyan Mission premises. The emphasis was to acquire an education to increase their morals and also to create teachers for future schools. The Wesleyan Mission at the Bangalore Cantonment was established in 1819, with the Tamil Services at the chapel (present Wesley Tamil Church, Haines Road), being well attended. Contact was mainly with the Tamil population, and for reaching to the Canarese, Thomas Hodson was being trained in that language. The chapel also conducted an English service for the benefit of the Wesleyan soldiers. Wesleyan Canarese School, 1834 Wesleyan Wayside Canarese Chapel at the Bangalore Petah (1856) Wesleyan Village Chapel and School Near Bangalore by Thomas Hodson (1859) New Canarese Wesleyan Chapel, Bangalore (January 1860, p.2, XVII) In 1834, Thomas Hodson of the Wesleyan Mission, purchased about 20 acres of land, just outside the Bangalore Petah (the current United Mission School and College, Unity Buildings, etc., a painting of the same is in the possession of the Museum of Sydney ). In the same year, Hodson had to take up the role of Supervisor of the Wesleyan Tamil Mission in the Bangalore Cantonment. During his tenure, he started an Anglo-Tamil school in the Bangalore Civil and Military Station. The reputation of the school spread, and several respected Hindu gentlemen of the Petah, requested Hodson to open a Canarese School in the Petah. Hence, a room was rented within the Fort walls and Wesleyan Mission Canarese School was started. In this room, Hodson preached his first sermon in Canarese in 1835. William Arthur's description According to William Arthur (an Irishman, after whom the William Arthur Memorial Church at Goobie is named after), the Wesleyan Canarese Mission was located in the Bangalore Petah, three miles from the Wesleyan Tamil Mission house. The land for the Wesleyan Canarese Mission was obtained by Thomas Hodson, and was located just outside one of the town gates. Initially, it was a school with a school room which served as the residence of the school master. The school provided English education. Thereafter Mr. Webber was sent to the mission. In 1840, Garrett and Jenkins were appointed as Wesleyan Canarese missionaries, with an authority to build a printing press and a mission-house. Thus was established the Wesleyan Mission Press, with the funding coming from English gentry. Thomas Hodson's Description Further, according to Thomas Hodson, the old town (Bangalore Petah) was surrounded by a wall (Bangalore Fort), with a moat which was dry and full of trees and thorny shrubs. The Wesleyan Canarese missionaries just lived outside the walls, near the town gates. Here they had a printing press where tracks, scriptures were prepared in Canarese. The premises also had a native school for boys and young men. A room in the end of the school was set aside for Christian worship. The Wesleyan missionaries wanted to build a chapel, but had difficulty finding a plot for the building. Hence, they preached on the streets on the street corners. They finally managed to buy an old dwelling by public auction in 1856, which had its front walls knocked off and some alterations made. This served as a wayside preaching chapel. It had two rooms, where 80 children were taught to read and write Canarese. So the chapel also served as a school. Thrice a week, missionaries preached from this wayside chapel, which attracted a crowd of 80-100 people who stood on the street to listen, while the children stayed inside the building, behind the preacher. The sketch of the Wesleyan Wayside Canarese Chapel appeared in the July 1857 issue of the 'Wesleyan Juvenile Offering' magazine. Sarah Sanderson's Description Writing on 24 November 1858, Sarah Sanderson (wife of Rev. Daniel Sanderson), describes the Wesleyan Mission School and Chapel in a Pariah village near the Bangalore Petah. The article also carried a sketch of the same, by Thomas Hodson. The Mission School and Chapel was raised by contributions from women of Hammersmith and Brentford, sent through Ms. E Farmer, contributions totaling to ¬£12 or BINR 150. This school had some 30 children, 22 boys and 8 girls. They were taught by John a native catechist. Divine services were held on Sundays in Canarese at 7:30AM. The congregation consisted of 8-10 men and 25-30 children, and many others listening from outside the door. However, most seemed to attend out of curiosity of seeing the European ladies and men. The church services commenced by ringing the bell. Further, she describes the social scorn and humiliation suffered by the Pariah community and how the church was helping them to gain confidence and dignity by providing education. Further, Sarah Sanderson, writing on 24 September 1859, describes the new Canarese Wesleyan Chapel (predecessor to the Hudson Memorial Church) which was consecrated a few months before September 1859. To the left of the Wesleyan Chapel was a low building, which had been altered and white-washed to serve as a school. The cost of building the chapel and vestries behind and the altering the building to the left all cost ¬£460. Except for ¬£11.10s which was donated by sponsors from Leeds, the rest of the funds came out of profits of the printing press. Samuel Dalzell's Description Writing on 10 July 1866 from Bangalore, Rev. Samuel Dalzell, talks about the Wesleyan Girls School in the Bangalore Petah, which Mrs. Dalzell had taken over as the superintendent. He describe that the girls school had become small and almost useless, with only 33 girls attending school regularly. Mrs. Dalzell, tried to propose the saying of morning prayers in the school, which was protested by the natives, leading to a number of students being stopped from attending school. However, they returned soon afterwards.

In the same year, Campbell obtained land in the main thoroughfare of the Bangalore Petah and a Canarese Chapel (predecessor to the present Rice Memorial Church on Avenue Road) was raised and the Canarese services was moved there. The chapel also served as a school and venue for religious discussions with the locals. In 1839, the Petah Chapel was extended to accommodate the growing congregation. In 1845, there was a further extension, and the chapel was also used as an English day school. In 1840, Mrs. Sewell, wife of Rev. James Sewell, opened the first Canarese Girls School for the natives at the Bangalore Peta. It was the first time native girls were able to attend school in this region. Rice prepared the textbooks in Canarese for teaching Geography and Arithmetic. In 1842, Rice and his wife started boarding at the Canarese School. The school still exists today, located on Mission Road (named after the London Mission), Bangalore and is now called the Mitralaya Girls High School . The school was supervised by Jane Rice till her death in 1864, when the school had around 400 girl students. After the death of Jane, Benjamin married Catherine Muller, a widow of the German missionary Rev. J J Muller, and daughter of Rev. C T E Rhenius (both of the Church Missionary Society, who served at Suviseshapuram in Tinnevelly). Catherine took charge of the boarding school along with her daughter Harriet. Catherine died in 1887, after which Harriet Muller took official charge of the boarding house, serving till 1911 when she retired. To impart English Education, in 1847, Rev. Benjamin Holt Rice (after whom the Rice Memorial Church is named after) of the London Mission established the Anglo-Vernacular School at Sultanpet, Bangalore, with 100 students. By 1859, there were 397 students, and the school moved into a new building.

At that time, the London Mission School was operating in the Bangalore Petah near the Mysore Bank (opposite to the present Kaveri Bhavan, next to present Shikshakara Bhavana). The Wesleyan Mission had a school operating in the Bangalore Petah. These two schools merged to form the United Mission School. The present Unity Building was built on the football ground of the school. M K Gandhi's Visit, 1929 The London Mission Chronicle records the visit of M K Gandhi to the school on 29 July 1929. A large crowd wanted to attend the event. But admission was restricted to staff and pupils of Mitralaya, missionaries of the LMS, and staff of the 2 LMS girl's day schools and the Wesleyan Mission School. The event started by singing the hymn Land of our Birth by Rudyard Kipling. The hymn was also used by Gandhi in his address to stress on the importance of sacrifice. A garland of spices was presented to him by the students. The school head mistress Ms. Mathai in her address expressed sympathy for Gandhi's cause. The proceedings ended with singing of the school anthem in English and the Tagore's Bengali national anthem.

Roberts (21 September 1886‚Äì 20 April 1969) was a Welsh missionary responsible for the initial Christian converts among the Hmar and other sister tribes in the Churachandpur district and Pherzawl districtof Southern Manipur, India. His ministry there touched the family of Rochunga Pudaite who ultimately developed a script for the tribal language and translated the New Testament into it. Biography Roberts was from Caernarvon in Wales where he worked in a stone slate quarry. He was converted through reading some sermons R. A. Torrey. During the 1904-1905 Welsh Revival Roberts decided to become a foreign missionary. He was a friend of medical doctor Peter Fraser. In 1908 Dr. Fraser and his wife headed for India to be medical missionaries among the Mizo tribal people. They paid for Roberts' passage to join their missionary party. The threesome arrived in Aizawl, India on December 9, 1908. A letter from Fraser to R. J. Williams, secretary of the Calvinist Methodist Mission Society, speaks of Roberts' level of commitment: \\"[Roberts] believes he would be disobeying our Lord if he stayed at home now for a number of years.\\" Fraser continues, \\"It is my duty and privilege to pray that the Lord will send out labourers into His harvest. Mr. Roberts seems to be an answer to that prayer.\\"Peter Fraser, letter to R. J. Williams, secretary, Calvinistic Methodist Mission Society, September 14, 1908, C. M. Archives, 27, 314, preserved in the National Library of Wales. At age 22, Roberts was much younger than other missionaries in the area. So, the Mizos immediately dubbed him 'Saptlangvala', the 'Youthful Sahib'. Roberts was still being called that when he was in his eighties. Over the northern border of Mizoram, people in the Hmar village of Senvawn, Manipur had heard of the Gospel. In 1910 the village chief Kamkholun wrote to the missionaries in Aizawl to ask about the Gospel. The missionary in charge said it was outside the province where British authorities had granted them permission to work. Furthermore, the Hmars were known to be headhunters.Larson, Craig Brian and Phyllis Ten Elshof (2009), 1001 Illustrations That Connect: Compelling Stories, Stats, and News Items for Preaching, Teaching, and Writing (Zondervan) Illustration 30 However, Roberts sent the Hmar village chief a copy of the Gospel of John. The chief's response was to ask for someone to come and explain what was written in that Gospel. Roberts told the British government agent in the area that he wanted to visit the Hmars. The agent said, \\"No, it's too dangerous.\\" Roberts showed him the tribal chief's invitation but was told it was deceptive. \\"They only want to chop your head off,\\" the agent said. On February 5, 1910, Roberts went anyway and was able to explain the gospel to the people. After a week of teaching, the chief and four other Hmar men announced that they wanted to make peace with the God of the Bible by believing on Jesus Christ. Though Roberts only spent a total of five days with the Hmars, the converts grew in faith and became leaders of a new, energetic church. Within two generations, the entire Hmar tribe had been evangelized. Headhunting stopped. In 1912, Roberts was suffering from a prolonged bout of \\"enteric fever,\\" so he was sent home to Wales to recuperate. While there he attended the 1914 Keswick Convention. There he met an English woman, Gladys Wescott Dobson, who also had a heart for overseas Christian missionary work. After much prayer, Roberts and Gladys were married at Thoburn Methodist Episcopal Church on 8 March 1915 in Kolkata, India. In 1931 she wrote 4 verses to the hymn \\"Wounded for Me\\" by her friend Rev. W.G. Ovens, which was published in Golden Bells. Roberts was from the Welsh Calvinist Methodist Church also called the Presbyterian Church of Wales. He established churches on Presbyterian principles, though they had no denominational attachment. He called his mission the Thadou-Kuki Mission, which in 1919 was renamed the North-East India General Mission. In 1924 Roberts visited the United States and received considerable financial support from there. Due to local believers aspirations to spread the Gospel to Burma, the organization was renamed again in 1930 to Indo-Burma Pioneer Mission. It was not to last though. The British Colonial authorities saw Roberts as a troublemaker who ignored the comity system in which mission organizations were assigned designated geographic regions where they were to be the sole Christian church. For having stayed overnight in Hmar homes where he also ate their food, British authorities expelled Roberts from India. Roberts returned home to Wales, his hopes and dreams shattered. He had no idea what would become of the seed he had planted. He eventually wound up in Canada, helping lead the Canadian arm of the Regions Beyond Missionary Union. Roberts stepped aside as chair of that organization in 1957 and died on April 20, 1969.Conley, Joseph F.

She was recognised as a leader not only of the Aboriginal community of Australia, but as a spokesperson for environmental issues in her hometown of Collarenebri, in New South Wales. She was known as a powerful and inspirational speaker. Isabel Flick is said to have had \\"many lives\\" because of her many experiences. Early years Isabel Flick's father was Mick Flick, who was born in the 1890s and grew up in the Aboriginal community in Miambla. His mother died very young, so he was brought up by his grandmother. Mick Flick joined the Australian army in 1914 after running away from his job. As he was too young to enlist, he lied about his age, and as Aboriginals did not have birth certificates he was accepted into the army. He was sent to the Western Front only six weeks after signing up. He fought in the Somme Valley but was injured twice and so sent to a hospital in England. On his return home from the war, Mick Flick met Celia Clevens and they were married. Celia Clevens grew up in the Aboriginal community of Goondiwindi in Queensland, Australia. They moved to the town of Collarenebri where they lived for a few years. Mick Flick worked on a farm and Celia lived at home and worked at their families station. The police constantly monitored their whereabouts so they needed to move from time to time to avoid being separated from each other. This was a common strategy amongst Aboriginal communities at the time as the government monitored their activities. Isabel Flick was born in 1928 in Goondiwindi, Queensland. She then moved and grew up in an Aboriginal riverbank camp in the town of Collarenebri in northwestern New South Wales, on the bank of the Barwon River. This town was seen as a border between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people, as Aboriginals would experience hostility from the non-Aboriginal population when going into the main street. The Flick family moved around a lot, just as Mick and Celia Flick had, as a way of \\"keeping away from the system\\" imposed by the government in Australia. Both of Flick's parents feared their children being taken away from them. Isabel Flick was always known for making trouble as a child, although she was a shy girl. She was known for being an encouraging and moving person when she spoke. At the age of 10 she was barred from formal education and even threatened with removal by the Protection Board. This was done in accordance with the ‚ÄòDog Act‚Äô. This sparked her campaign for Aboriginal rights from her experience with such discrimination and mistreatment. Toomelah Mission In 1938, Flick along with her cousins, Florrie and Bob were moved away from their parents to live with their grandmother at the Toomelah Mission in inland New South Wales. Tin camps were built for them to live in here. This was a very controlled time in all of their lives. Permission was needed for everything, and arrangements were always made, such as attending Sunday school and church services. If something wasn't up to adequate standards at the house they lived in, or they didn't act in the desired way then the Matron had the right to correct it. Although this was a very organised and often restricted time in Flick's life, it was where she learnt to read and write, and where she received an education although it was only up to a present-day year 3's education. It was here where the government wanted the aboriginal children to assimilate into ‚Äòwhite society‚Äô. Flick's parents would often come to visit her but this was not done very often, and usually not together. Her father was only allowed to stay for one hour and she was only allowed one visitor at a time. Flick began to realise how Aboriginals had very limited rights and it was here she witnessed her first activist meeting. She returned home from the Toomelah Mission to Collarenebri to her mother and her father in 1942 wanting to make positive changes to her community. Teenage and adult years As a teenager, Flick began to become fed up with the rudeness that always occurred towards Aboriginals in social situations. She remembers clearly an instance where people attending a Slim Dusty concert who were not Aboriginals, held their noses as she and two of her Aboriginal friends walked past. She was always careful about what she said, as she didn't want to ‚Äòrock the boat‚Äô but she knew that those kinds of things should not occur. There were many other occurrences such as this where she was discriminated against, and not allowed to be in certain areas or experience the same things the ‚Äòwhite‚Äô population could. Another example was where Flick was in a caf√© and the server refused to take her order because they didn't serve people of ‚Äòher kind‚Äô. Today it is recognised the discrimination that occurred, but at the time it was the normal practice of non-Aboriginal society. By 1950, Flick's focus had changed from her teenage years to her role as an adult. In 1949 she gave birth to a boy Ben, with partner Aud. She also had her work to worry about. She worked on pastoral stations with her family, with shearing contracts her father had organised for her. For the first few years of Ben's life he stayed with his grandfather, Flick's father. At seven, he was sent to school. Flick later had many more children with Aud. It was still a very difficult time for Flick during these years, as the police were always aware of Aboriginals and monitored there whereabouts and activities. If one were found to be drunk they would instantly be taken away. They could be checked at any time even if they were getting changed or in the bathtub for example. Never would they check if it was suitable for them to enter. It was also a difficult time as disease was spreading. One of her family members had picked a disease up and from a fear of it spreading; the government had put their entire village in quarantine. Eventually the disease passed and they were all able to return to their normal life of work once again. Aboriginal activism Due to her experience with racism in rural Australia and the various camps she attended, she spent her life wanting more for Aboriginals. Her first experience of speaking out publicly against such racism was at a ‚ÄòLiberty Picture Show‚Äô in 1961 in Collarenebri. The 1960s were a difficult time for her and the Aboriginal community due to a lack of employment opportunities causing economic distress, but it was during this decade that she felt growing confidence to speak out about the issues she was experiencing and the racism of her town. She challenged the seating arrangements arguing that \\"our money is as good as anyone else's and we want to sit where we want to sit\\". Aboriginals were typically roped off at an area at the front of the screen. Picture shows were typically the most recent places to isolate Aboriginals from the ‚Äòwhite population‚Äô and this caused significant humiliation for them. She experienced segregation and discrimination in not only these picture shows, but in education, health, employment and even before the law. Her radical acts are said to have inspired the 1965 Freedom Ride in rural Australia. She was at first embarrassed to outwardly discuss racism but her confidence grew over time. She soon was known on the political stage. Although her efforts were directed at the non-Aboriginal community at their treatment of Aboriginals, she was not afraid to speak openly about justice and unequal treatment to her own community and people as well. Racism was something not only Flick experienced, for her son Ben experienced this at school and Flick would never put up with this for him. She \\"lost it\\" when he got hit across the hand with a ruler by a non-Aboriginal teacher during a school lesson. This then led the Parent and Citizens Association at the school to draw on Flick's knowledge and skill. They lobbied with Flick to the Department of Education for better education standards and facilities to learn in. It is ironic how Flick was not allowed to enter this school in 1938, however was now a spokesperson on their behalf. The Australian political scene was changing for Aboriginals in the 1960s, with the Federal electoral laws changing in 1961 to allow Aboriginals to vote in national elections. In 1965, the Parliamentary Committee came to Collarenebri, after the Freedom Ride passed through. It was then that Isabel Flick met politicians and discussed Aboriginal living conditions and the way they were treated by the police. Henry Denyer was the man who encouraged Isabel to speak to these politicians and become an active member in the Collarenebri Muni community. Flick then later began to discuss the importance of protecting women and children from family violence as this was deeply rooted in her community and family experiences in Collarenebri. Move to Sydney Isabel Flick left Collarenebri in 1972 and moved to Sydney. She was concerned of her children's education in Collarenebri, believing that the schools in the area were not sufficient for educating older children. Ben was now independent and had a successful regional football career with Narrabi Football Club and then Bathurst Football Club, and Larry was working but wanted to stay home in Collarenebri. Flick hoped moving to the city would benefit her other children; Tony, Brenda, Amy and Aub. When they first moved they struggled to find accommodation camping with family and friends in Bridge Road, Glebe. Soon though the family moved to 102 Johnston Street, Annandale, New South Wales. Flick worked at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital during this time. She felt a sense of ‚Äòrelease‚Äô from her move, as it was a new beginning for her. The family didn't experience hostility, as much in the city and this was really refreshing for her. During her time in Sydney, she became more involved in Aboriginal activist groups, in the Foundation for Aboriginal Affairs, in South Sydney Community Aid and the Aboriginal Tent Embassy. During the year of 1977, Flick's health deteriorated as she struggled to make a substantial income for her family who still lived in their Annandale home. To relax, she would smoke, which was deteriorating her health further. She started to realise that smoking was aggravating her hypertension and chest infections but she still found it was too difficult to give up smoking, due to the environment she was in and her addiction. She resigned from the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and became a health worker in the Aboriginal Health Unit in the NSW Department of Health. During this time her work increased with Aboriginal Land Rights and the Aboriginal Tent Embassy. Later life She returned to her hometown of Collarenebri in 1978, where her fellow Aboriginal community recognised her political experience and courage, and even non- Aboriginal people of her town acknowledged her, as well. Her relationship with Aud had ended before she returned. Her popularity was proved when was chosen by both Aboriginals and non-Aboriginals to be the spokesperson of their town. From her time in Sydney, she had a vast amount of resources and connections, which allowed her to implement special initiatives in her town. She was able to negotiate well and deal with various egos, which made her easy to work with. On her return home, she also entered into a relationship with childhood friend, Ted Thorne. The two had always been friends and they now were happy together. Segregation still was present in Collarenebri, but it was definitely a different place to when Flick first lived there. Flick lobbied for fairness and equality in this region and also for a fairer system with housing, health and education. Aboriginal employment was a major win for Flick as it meant Aboriginals were given the opportunity to be in the workforce with the white population. Throughout the 1980s, she fought a difficult battle, with her sister Rose Flick, to protect the carved trees at the Bora Ground site in Collymongle, northern New South Wales, which was a sacred part of their Aboriginal community. These carved trees were a special part of Australian Aboriginal history and she wanted to preserve these for future generations. In 1996, Flick travelled to Sydney to teach Aboriginal history at the Tranby Cooperative Aboriginal College in Glebe, New South Wales. She was on the board of directors at this College, where she enjoyed teaching Aboriginal history. She enjoyed giving back to her community and mentoring students. This was after her surgery of December 1995. At this time she also moved away from Collarenebri to Gunnedeh, New South Wales, with her partner Ted, still being involved with her activist work especially with the Land Council. Death and legacy In her final years, Flick developed lung cancer due to many years of smoking. She had chemotherapy and her family cared for her until she died on 16 February 2000. For her service to the community, Isabel Ann Flick was awarded the Order of Australia Medal in 1986.Heather Goodall (2019) \\"Hidden women of history: Isabel Flick, the tenacious campaigner who fought segregation in Australia\\" The Conversation. Published 6 June 2019. Accessed 6 June 2019. She was then honoured by the Tranby Aboriginal Cooperative College where she taught and by her community in 1993, and then again at her death in 2000. Also at her death, her family received condolences from the Premier of New South Wales and the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, proving her contribution to the Australian Aboriginal community.

He was killed in a ballooning accident. Zambeccari was born in Bologna in 1756, son of Senator Giacomo Zambeccari. He studied at the Collegio dei nobili in Parma and then enlisted in the Guardia Real in Spain and served in the Spanish Navy. He fled from the Spanish Inquisition, and was in Paris in 1783 where he observed the first unmanned balloon flights by the Montgolfier brothers. He then moved to London and launched the first unmanned balloon in Britain on 4 November 1783, a year before the first manned flight in England by Vincent Lunardi, releasing a hydrogen balloon from the house of Michael Biaggini, a maker of artificial flowers made from silk and other fabrics, at 33 Noble Street, on Cheapside. The balloon was later found by a farmer at Waltham Abbey. The experiment was repeated a few weeks later, as a commercial enterprise for which Zambeccari and Biaggini sold tickets, with a release of a balloon from the grounds of the Honourable Artillery Company on 25 November; this balloon was found nearly away at Petworth. Biaggini released an even larger balloon from Grosvenor Square in January 1784. Zambeccari was commissioned to launch a balloon in Venice in April 1784, an occasion that was painted by Francesco Guardi. He also collaborated with Vincent Lunardi before Lunardi's first manned flight in England on 15 September 1784. Zambeccari and Admiral Sir Edward Vernon ascended in a balloon from Tottenham Court Road on 23 March 1785 and landed later the same day near Horsham. The balloon was later displayed at the Lyceum. He also flew from Norwich later that year. Zambeccari moved to St Petersburg in 1787 and served in the Russian Imperial Navy. He was captured by the Turks in 1787 and held prisoner in Constantinople for over two years. His freedom was secured by the Spanish ambassador. He returned to Bologna, and married Diamante Negrini. They had three children, including . He spent the rest of his life experimenting with balloons, generally using a combination of a hot air balloon and hydrogen balloon known as a rozi√®re after Jean-Fran√ßois Pil√¢tre de Rozier. He sought a method of steering using rudders or oars. He published a five-volume work on ballooning in London in 1803. He and his companions were rescued from the Adriatic Sea, twice, in 1803 and 1804. The government of Bologna sponsored a flight in 1803. Bad weather caused the flight to be postponed in September 1803. Wanting to avoid a second postponement, the balloon took off in bad weather on 7 October. Zambeccari was accompanied by and Gaetano Grassetti. In bad visibility, the balloon crashed into the Adriatic Sea early the following morning. Similarly, another flight with Andreoli on 23 August 1804 also crashed into the Adriatic Sea. Zambeccari died in September 1812, when his balloon caught fire after an unsuccessful landing attempt. His companion, Bonaga, survived. He was buried in the family tomb in the Basilica of San Francesco. His remains were moved to the Certosa di Bologna in 1813, but returned to San Francesco in 1926 to be interred with his son Livio in the monument to his relation Alessandro Zambeccari.

Security contractors program is the software to define restricted areas within the camera's view (such as a fenced off area, a parking lot but not the sidewalk or public street outside the lot) and program for times of day (such as after the close of business) for the property being protected by the camera surveillance. The artificial intelligence (\\"A.I.\\") sends an alert if it detects a trespasser breaking the \\"rule\\" set that no person is allowed in that area during that time of day. The A.I. program functions by using machine vision. Machine vision is a series of algorithms, or mathematical procedures, which work like a flow-chart or series of questions to compare the object seen with hundreds of thousands of stored reference images of humans in different postures, angles, positions and movements. The A.I. asks itself if the observed object moves like the reference images, whether it is approximately the same size height relative to width, if it has the characteristic two arms and two legs, if it moves with similar speed, and if it is vertical instead of horizontal. Many other questions are possible, such as the degree to which the object is reflective, the degree to which it is steady or vibrating, and the smoothness with which it moves. Combining all of the values from the various questions, an overall ranking is derived which gives the A.I. the probability that the object is or is not a human. If the value exceeds a limit that is set, then the alert is sent. It is characteristic of such programs that they are self- learning to a degree, learning, for example that humans or vehicles appear bigger in certain portions of the monitored image ‚Äì those areas near the camera ‚Äì than in other portions, those being the areas farthest from the camera. In addition to the simple rule restricting humans or vehicles from certain areas at certain times of day, more complex rules can be set. The user of the system may wish to know if vehicles drive in one direction but not the other. Users may wish to know that there are more than a certain preset number of people within a particular area. The A.I. is capable of maintaining surveillance of hundreds of cameras simultaneously. Its ability to spot a trespasser in the distance or in rain or glare is superior to humans' ability to do so. This type of A.I. for security is known as \\"rule-based\\" because a human programmer must set rules for all of the things for which the user wishes to be alerted. This is the most prevalent form of A.I. for security. Many video surveillance camera systems today include this type of A.I. capability. The hard-drive that houses the program can either be located in the cameras themselves or can be in a separate device that receives the input from the cameras. A newer, non-rule based form of A.I. for security called \\"behavioral analytics\\" has been developed. This software is fully self- learning with no initial programming input by the user or security contractor. In this type of analytics, the A.I. learns what is normal behavior for people, vehicles, machines, and the environment based on its own observation of patterns of various characteristics such as size, speed, reflectivity, color, grouping, vertical or horizontal orientation and so forth. The A.I. normalizes the visual data, meaning that it classifies and tags the objects and patterns it observes, building up continuously refined definitions of what is normal or average behavior for the various observed objects. After several weeks of learning in this fashion it can recognize when things break the pattern. When it observes such anomalies it sends an alert. For example, it is normal for cars to drive in the street. A car seen driving up onto a sidewalk would be an anomaly. If a fenced yard is normally empty at night, then a person entering that area would be an anomaly.  History   Statement of the problem  Limitations in the ability of humans to vigilantly monitor video surveillance live footage led to the demand for artificial intelligence that could better serve the task. Humans watching a single video monitor for more than twenty minutes lose 95% of their ability to maintain attention sufficient to discern significant events.Green, Mary W. (1999) The Appropriate and Effective Use of Security Technologies in U.S. Schools, A Guide for Schools and Law Enforcement Agencies, Sandia National Laboratories With two monitors this is cut in half again.Sulman, N.; Sanocki, T.; Goldgof, D.; Kasturi, R., How effective is human video surveillance performance?, Pattern Recognition, ICPR 2008. 19th International Conference on, vol., no., pp.1,3, 8-11 Dec. 2008 Given that many facilities have dozens or even hundreds of cameras, the task is clearly beyond human ability. In general, the camera views of empty hallways, storage facilities, parking lots or structures are exceedingly boring and thus attention is quickly attenuated. When multiple cameras are monitored, typically employing a wall monitor or bank of monitors with split screen views and rotating every several seconds between one set of cameras and the next, the visual tedium is quickly overwhelming. While video surveillance cameras proliferated with great adoption by users ranging from car dealerships and shopping plazas to schools and businesses to highly secured facilities such as nuclear plants, it was recognized in hindsight that video surveillance by human officers (also called \\"operators\\") was impractical and ineffective. Extensive video surveillance systems were relegated to merely recording for possible forensic use to identify someone, after the fact of a theft, arson, attack or incident. Where wide angle camera views were employed, particularly for large outdoor areas, severe limitations were discovered even for this purpose due to insufficient resolution.Nuechterlein, K.H., Parasuraman, R., & Jiang, Q. (1983). Visual sustained attention: Image degradation produces rapid sensitivity decrement over time. Science, 220, 327-329 In these cases it is impossible to identify the trespasser or perpetrator because their image is too tiny on the monitor.We can can recognise humans separately animals,vehicles artificial intelligence is just like and human brain  Earlier attempts at solution   Motion detection cameras  In response to the shortcomings of human guards to watch surveillance monitors long-term, the first solution was to add motion detectors to cameras. It was reasoned that an intruder's or perpetrator's motion would send an alert to the remote monitoring officer obviating the need for constant human vigilance. The problem was that in an outdoor environment there is constant motion or changes of pixels that comprise the total viewed image on screen. The motion of leaves on trees blowing in the wind, litter along the ground, insects, birds, dogs, shadows, headlights, sunbeams and so forth all comprise motion. This caused hundreds or even thousands of false alerts per day, rendering this solution inoperable except in indoor environments during times of non-operating hours.  Advanced video motion detection  The next evolution reduced false alerts to a degree but at the cost of complicated and time-consuming manual calibration. Here, changes of a target such as a person or vehicle relative to a fixed background are detected. Where the background changes seasonally or due to other changes, the reliability deteriorates over time. The economics of responding to too many false alerts again proved to be an obstacle and this solution was not sufficient.  Advent of true video analytics  Machine learning of visual recognition relates to patterns and their classification.Pedro Domingos, The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World, September 22, 2015 Basic BooksDavies, E. R. (2012) Computer and Machine Vision, Fourth Edition: Theory, Algorithms, Practicalities Academic Press, Waltham Mass. True video analytics can distinguish the human form, vehicles and boats or selected objects from the general movement of all other objects and visual static or changes in pixels on the monitor. It does this by recognizing patterns. When the object of interest, for example a human, violates a preset rule, for example that the number of people shall not exceed zero in a pre-defined area during a defined time interval, then an alert is sent. A red rectangle or so-called \\"bounding box\\" will typically automatically follow the detected intruder, and a short video clip of this is sent as the alert.  Practical application   Real- time preventative action  The detection of intruders using video surveillance has limitations based on economics and the nature of video cameras. Typically, cameras outdoors are set to a wide angle view and yet look out over a long distance. Frame rate per second and dynamic range to handle brightly lit areas and dimly lit ones further challenge the camera to actually be adequate to see a moving human intruder. At night, even in illuminated outdoor areas, a moving subject does not gather enough light per frame per second and so, unless quite close to the camera, will appear as a thin wisp or barely discernible ghost or completely invisible. Conditions of glare, partial obscuration, rain, snow, fog, and darkness all compound the problem. Even when a human is directed to look at the actual location on a monitor of a subject in these conditions, the subject will usually not be detected. The A.I. is able to impartially look at the entire image and all cameras' images simultaneously. Using statistical models of degrees of deviation from its learned pattern of what constitutes the human form it will detect an intruder with high reliability and a low false alert rate even in adverse conditions.Dufour, Jean-Yves, Intelligent Video Surveillance Systems, John Wiley Publisher (2012) Its learning is based on approximately a quarter million images of humans in various positions, angles, postures, and so forth. A one megapixel camera with the onboard video analytics was able to detect a human at a distance of about 350' and an angle of view of about 30 degrees in non-ideal conditions. Rules could be set for a \\"virtual fence\\" or intrusion into a pre-defined area. Rules could be set for directional travel, object left behind, crowd formation and some other conditions. Artificial intelligence for video surveillance is widely used in China. See Mass surveillance in China.  Talk-down  One of the most powerful features of the system is that a human officer or operator, receiving an alert from the A.I., could immediately talk down over outdoor public address loudspeakers to the intruder. This had high deterrence value as most crimes are opportunistic and the risk of capture to the intruder becomes so pronounced when a live person is talking to them that they are very likely to desist from intrusion and to retreat. The security officer would describe the actions of the intruder so that the intruder had no doubt that a real person was watching them. The officer would announce that the intruder was breaking the law and that law enforcement was being contacted and that they were being video- recorded.Hantman, Ken (2014) What is Video Analytics, Simply Explained  Verified breach report  The police receive a tremendous number of false alarms from burglar alarms. In fact the security industry reports that over 98% of such alarms are false ones. Accordingly, the police give very low priority response to burglar alarms and can take from twenty minutes to two hours to respond to the site. By contrast, the video analytic-detected crime is reported to the central monitoring officer, who verifies with his or her own eyes that it is a real crime in progress. He or she then dispatches to the police who give such calls their highest priority.  Behavioral analytics   Active environments  While rule-based video analytics worked economically and reliably for many security applications there are many situations in which it cannot work.Rice, Derek, Finding & Selling The Value of Analytics, SDM Magazine (Sept 2015) BNP Media II, Troy Michigan For an indoor or outdoor area where no one belongs during certain times of day, for example overnight, or for areas where no one belongs at any time such as a cell tower, traditional rule-based analytics are perfectly appropriate. In the example of a cell tower the rare time that a service technician may need to access the area would simply require calling in with a pass-code to put the monitoring response \\"on test\\" or inactivated for the brief time the authorized person was there. But there are many security needs in active environments in which hundreds or thousands of people belong all over the place all the time. For example, a college campus, an active factory, a hospital or any active operating facility. It is not possible to set rules that would discriminate between legitimate people and criminals or wrong-doers.  Overcoming the problem of active environments  Using behavioral analytics, a self- learning, non-rule-based A.I. takes the data from video cameras and continuously classifies objects and events that it sees. For example, a person crossing a street is one classification. A group of people is another classification. A vehicle is one classification, but with continued learning a public bus would be discriminated from a small truck and that from a motorcycle. With increasing sophistication, the system recognizes patterns in human behavior. For example, it might observe that individuals pass through a controlled access door one at a time. The door opens, the person presents their proximity card or tag, the person passes through and the door closes. This pattern of activity, observed repeatedly, forms a basis for what is normal in the view of the camera observing that scene. Now if an authorized person opens the door but a second \\"tail-gating\\" unauthorized person grabs the door before it closes and passes through, that is the sort of anomaly that would create an alert. This type of analysis is much more complex than the rule-based analytics. While the rule-based analytics work mainly to detect intruders into areas where no one is normally present at defined times of day, the behavioral analytics works where people are active to detect things that are out of the ordinary. A fire breaking out outdoors would be an unusual event and would cause an alert, as would a rising cloud of smoke. Vehicles driving the wrong way into a one-way driveway would also typify the type of event that has a strong visual signature and would deviate from the repeatedly observed pattern of vehicles driving the correct one-way in the lane. Someone thrown to the ground by an attacker would be an unusual event that would likely cause an alert. This is situation-specific. So if the camera viewed a gymnasium where wrestling was practiced the A.I. would learn it is usual for one human to throw another to the ground, in which case it would not alert on this observation.  What the artificial intelligence 'understands'  The A.I. does not know or understand what a human is, or a fire, or a vehicle. It is simply finding characteristics of these things based on their size, shape, color, reflectivity, angle, orientation, motion, and so on. It then finds that the objects it has classified have typical patterns of behavior. For example, humans walk on sidewalks and sometimes on streets but they don't climb up the sides of buildings very often. Vehicles drive on streets but don't drive on sidewalks. Thus the anomalous behavior of someone scaling a building or a vehicle veering onto a sidewalk would trigger an alert.  Varies from traditional mindset of security systems  Typical alarm systems are designed to not miss true positives (real crime events) and to have as low of a false alarm rate as possible. In that regard, burglar alarms miss very few true positives but have a very high false alarm rate even in the controlled indoor environment. Motion detecting cameras miss some true positives but are plagued with overwhelming false alarms in an outdoor environment. Rule-based analytics reliably detect most true positives and have a low rate of false positives but cannot perform in active environments, only in empty ones. Also they are limited to the simple discrimination of whether an intruder is present or not. Something as complex or subtle as a fight breaking out or an employee breaking a safety procedure is not possible for a rule based analytics to detect or discriminate. With behavioral analytics, it is. Places where people are moving and working do not present a problem. However, the A.I. may spot many things that appear anomalous but are innocent in nature. For example, if students at a campus walk on a plaza, that will be learned as normal. If a couple of students decided to carry a large sheet outdoors flapping in the wind, that might indeed trigger an alert. The monitoring officer would be alerted to look at his or her monitor and would see that the event is not a threat and would then ignore it. The degree of deviation from norm that triggers an alert can be set so that only the most abnormal things are reported. However, this still constitutes a new way of human and A.I. interaction not typified by the traditional alarm industry mindset. This is because there will be many false alarms that may nevertheless be valuable to send to a human officer who can quickly look and determine if the scene requires a response. In this sense, it is a \\"tap on the shoulder\\" from the A.I. to have the human look at something.  Limitations of behavioral analytics  Because so many complex things are being processed continuously, the software samples down to the very low resolution of only 1 CIF to conserve computational demand. The 1 CIF resolution means that an object the size of a human will not be detected if the camera utilized is wide angle and the human is more than sixty to eighty feet distant depending on conditions. Larger objects like vehicles or smoke would be detectable at greater distances.  Quantification of situational awareness  The utility of artificial intelligence for security does not exist in a vacuum, and its development was not driven by purely academic or scientific study. Rather, it is addressed to real world needs, and hence, economic forces. Its use for non-security applications such as operational efficiency, shopper heat-mapping of display areas (meaning how many people are in a certain area in a retail space), and attendance at classes are developing uses.Gruber, Illy, The Evolution of Video Analytics, Security Sales & Integration magazine (August 11, 2012) Security Sales & Integration, Framingham MA Humans are not as well qualified as A.I. to compile and recognize patterns consisting of very large data sets requiring simultaneous calculations in multiple remote viewed locations. There is nothing natively human about such awareness. Such multi- tasking has been shown to defocus human attention and performance. A.I.s have the ability to handle such data. For the purposes of security interacting with video cameras they functionally have better visual acuity than humans or the machine approximation to it. For judging subtleties of behaviors or intentions of subjects or degrees of threat, humans remain far superior at the present state of the technology. So the A.I. in security functions to broadly scan beyond human capability and to vet the data to a first level of sorting of relevance and to alert the human officer who then takes over the function of assessment and response. Security in the practical world is economically determined so that the expenditure of preventative security will never typically exceed the perceived cost of the risk to be avoided. Studies have shown that companies typically only spend about one twenty-fifth the amount on security that their actual losses cost them.Bressler, Martin S., The Impact of Crime on Business: A Model of Prevention, Detection & Remedy, Journal of Management and Marketing Research (2009) What by pure economic theory should be an equivalence or homeostasis, thus falls vastly short of it. One theory that explains this is cognitive dissonance, or the ease with which unpleasant things like risk can be shunted from the conscious mind. Nevertheless, security is a major expenditure, and comparison of the costs of different means of security is always foremost amongst security professionals. Another reason that future security threats or losses are under-assessed is that often only the direct cost of a potential loss is considered instead of the spectrum of consequential losses that are concomitantly experienced. For example, the vandalism-destruction of a custom production machine in a factory or of a refrigerated tractor trailer would result in a long replacement time during which customers could not be served, resulting in loss of their business. A violent crime will have extensive public relations damage for an employer, beyond the direct liability for failing to protect the employee. Behavioral analytics uniquely functions beyond simple security and, due to its ability to observe breaches in standard patterns of protocols, it can effectively find unsafe acts of employees that may result in workers comp or public liability incidents. Here too, the assessment of future incidents' costs falls short of the reality. A study by Liberty Mutual Insurance Company showed that the cost to employers is about six times the direct insured cost, since uninsured costs of consequential damages include temporary replacement workers, hiring costs for replacements, training costs, managers' time in reports or court, adverse morale on other workers, and effect on customer and public relations.Safety Index Report, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (2002) The potential of A.I. in the form of behavioral analytics to proactively intercept and prevent such incidents is significant.

Those were mainly Serbs from the Austrian Empire (later Austria-Hungary), and also, by the end of the century, from the Kingdom of Serbia and Principality of Montenegro. Emigration was mainly directed to the United States. Among emigrants, there were several Serbian Orthodox priests, and by the end of the 19th-century first parish communities were established and churches built. Wrote Fern A. Wallace in his 1974 book, \\"The Flame and the Candle\\", that the city of Douglas (now Juno, Alaska) was a very rich mining town at the turn of the century. During this time, large groups of Serbs from Montenegro came to Douglas to work in the gold mines of the Treadwell Company. Among these Serb pioneers arose the traditional desire to establish their own church as well as their own print shop. An article told of the first Serbian pioneers in Alaska and their fraternal efforts to build a church for themselves and for the generations of Serbs in Alaska. These documents were signed by 286 members of the Saint Sava Church (Douglas, Alaska), eight members of the church board, and three priests, headed by Archimandrite Sebastian Dabovich. Saint Francisco Bay Area can be rightly considered one of the first centers of Orthodox Christianity in the United States, and Serbs played a major role in its early development. There are documents showing that there were attempts to enlist a Serbian Orthodox priest from Kotor to serve a community as early as the 1870s. Of these early Orthodox priests in America, we know very little about them because of the scarcity of sources on their missions. Somehow more is known of the activities of American-born Father Sebastian Dabovich and the Archimandrite Firmilijan, who came from Serbia to serve the Serbs in Chicago in 1892. It was due primarily to their efforts and to the efforts of the priests who followed them. In 1893-1894, Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church was built in Jackson, California, thanks to the efforts of priest Sebastian Dabovich, who was the first Eastern Orthodox priest born in the USA. Since there was no Serbian Diocese in the US, parishes that were formed during that period were temporarily placed under the jurisdiction of the Russian Orthodox Diocese in North America. In the eave of the First World War, first steps were made towards the creation of a particular Serbian Orthodox Diocese in the United States, under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Serbian Orthodox Church. It was officially established as Serbian Orthodox Diocese of America and Canada, in 1921, by the Holy Synod of the Serbian Orthodox Church. In 1923, administration of the Diocese was entrusted to archimandrite Mardarije Uskokoviƒá, who was elected and consecrated as Serbian Orthodox bishop of America and Canada in 1926. After his death in 1935, the diocese was administered until the election of new bishop Dionisije Milivojeviƒá in 1939. By the middle of the 20th century, the network of Serbian Orthodox communities in the US and Canada was much expanded due to constant immigration, and soon after the Second World War, it was proposed on several occasions to reorganize the wast continental diocese by division into two or three regional dioceses. Those proposals were opposed by Bishop Dionisije who favored centralized administration. Gradually, various administrative problems escalated and by 1963 final decisions were made by the central authorities of the Serbian Orthodox Church to reorganize and divide the diocese into three regional dioceses. Since 1963, Serbian Orthodox Church in USA and Canada consisted of: * Serbian Orthodox Diocese of Eastern America and Canada * Serbian Orthodox Diocese of Midwestern America * Serbian Orthodox Diocese of Western America Reorganization was strongly opposed by bishop Dionisije, who was supported by several fractions of Serbian political emigration in the USA. Conflict resulted into schism since Dionisije refused to recognize decisions of the Holy Synod. Thus, two parallel ecclesiastical structures were created, the official \\"patriarchal\\" branch organized into three dioceses, and alternative \\"free\\" branch headed by Dionisije, who was officially deposed.

It was first formed in the Leningrad Military District in August, 1941, and continued in service in the northern sector of the Soviet-German front until the end of 1944. It spent much of the war attempting to break the German siege of Leningrad, in which it helped to achieve partial success in January, 1943, and complete success one year later. During these operations the soldiers of the 54th served under five different commanders, most notably Col. Gen. Ivan Fedyuninsky in the winter of 1941‚Äì42. After helping to drive Army Group North away from Leningrad and into the Baltic states in the first nine months of 1944, the army was deemed surplus to requirements on the narrowing front, and was officially disbanded on the last day of the year.  Formation  The 54th Army was first formed in August, 1941, in the Leningrad Military District, to the east of the city in the vicinity of the town of Volkhov.David M. Glantz and Jonathan House, When Titans Clashed, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 1995, pp 69‚Äì70 Its first commander was Marshal of the Soviet Union Grigory Kulik. When it was first formed the army's order of battle was as follows: * 285th Rifle Division * 286th Rifle Division * 310th Rifle Division * 314th Rifle Division * 27th Cavalry Division * 122nd Tank Brigade * 119th Separate Tank Battalion * 881st and 882nd Corps Artillery Regiments * 150th Pontoon Bridge Battalion It also contained four motorized engineer battalions, and by the end of September it had been reinforced with the 3rd and 4th Guards Rifle Divisions, the 21st Tank Division, and the 16th Tank Brigade.Glantz, The Battle for Leningrad 1941 ‚Äì 1944, University of Kansas Press, Lawrence, KS, 2002, p 83 Leningrad was isolated on Sept. 8 when the German forces captured Shlisselburg. The next day Gen. G.K. Zhukov took over coordinating the defense of the city from Marshal K.E. Voroshilov. 54th Army was under direct command of STAVKA, and on Zhukov's recommendations it was ordered into the attack on the 10th. This first attempt to break the blockade, the First Sinyavino Offensive, gained only 6 ‚Äì 10km. during 16 days of on-and-off heavy fighting. Kulik was heavily criticized by both STAVKA and Zhukov for this dismal performance. When the Germans pushed back even some of these meagre gains, Kulik was sacked, court-martialed and reduced in rank.Glantz, Leningrad, pp 69, 75, 83 He was replaced by Lt. Gen. M.S. Khozin, a protege of Zhukov. On Oct. 26, Khozin was promoted to command of the Leningrad Front and was replaced by Lt. Gen. I.I. Fedyuninsky, another Zhukov protege.Glantz, Leningrad, pp xvii, xviii, 94  Tikhvin Offensive  A second attempt on Sinyavino was being prepared to start on Oct. 20, but was pre-empted by the German offensive towards Tikhvin on Oct. 16, which intended to encircle 54th Army on the way to cutting all possible supply routes to Leningrad and linking up with the Finnish Army.Glantz, Leningrad, p 89, 94 In the face of this attack, the army, which had the bulk of the Soviet forces between Lake Ladoga and Lake Ilmen, was ordered to transfer the 4th Guards and 310th Rifle Divisions to 4th Army on Oct. 23. By Nov. 8, the entire German offensive had ground to a halt, due to Soviet resistance and the winter weather. 54th Army had not been encircled, and while Tikhvin had been taken, there had been no linkup with the Finns, and Army Group North was vastly over-extended. A new directive from Hitler ordered yet another attack on the army at Volkhov, but a desperate counterattack by 310th Rifle Division stopped the 8th Panzer Division east of the town.Glantz, Leningrad, p 101 At this point, Fedyuninsky asked that 4th Army's Volkhov Operational Group of four rifle divisions and one rifle brigade be assigned to his command, which was approved on Nov. 12. While redeploying his forces, Fedyuninsky was faced with a German thrust to his army's rear toward Lake Ladoga. The successful counterattack by 285th Rifle Division and 122nd Tank Brigade set the stage for 54th Army to participate in the general Soviet counter-offensive along the entire front.Glantz, Leningrad, p 102 On Nov. 26 the army's main shock group (3rd Guards, 310th, and 311th Rifle Divisions and the 6th Naval Infantry Brigade) attacked the German 21st Infantry Division of I Army Corps south of Volkhov, driving it back several kilometres by the 29th. A few days later Fedyuninsky was further reinforced with the 80th Rifle Division and on Dec. 3 he renewed the attack on the German corps, driving its left flank southwards and successively encircling and destroying several companies of the 254th Infantry Division. The 115th and 198th Rifle Divisions then also arrived from Leningrad, joined the assault on the 15th, and helped drive the Germans back to Olomny by the 17th, enveloping the I Corps' left flank on the west bank of the Volkhov River. During their retreat, 54th Army's 1st and 2nd Ski Battalions constantly harassed the Germans' flank and rear. In the final stages, elements of three rifle divisions cut the Mga ‚Äì Kirishi rail line, but the army was unable to capture the latter stronghold, which would remain in German hands until the autumn of 1943.Glantz, Leningrad, pp 109‚Äì11  Lyuban Offensive Operation  Having liberated the territory occupied by the Germans in their Tikhvin offensive and caused them significant casualties, Stalin expected his armies to be able to break the siege of Leningrad, as part of a series of offensives across the front. Gen. K.A. Meretskov of Volkhov Front wrote: The new offensive was launched by 54th Army on Jan. 4, 1942 when it once again attacked I Corps, to the west of Kirishi. Forty-eight hours of heavy fighting produced an advance of only 4 ‚Äì 5km, after which a counterattack by 12th Panzer Division drove Fedyuninsky's troops back to their starting line. The attack was renewed on Jan. 13 and the village of Pogoste was taken on the 17th, but that was the limit of success.Glantz, Leningrad, pp 158, 162 By mid-February 2nd Shock Army of Volkhov Front had driven across that river and was forcing its way through the swamps towards Lyuban, well in the German rear, but were unable to break out decisively toward Leningrad. On Feb. 26, Leningrad Front received the following: Reinforcement of the army with the 4th Guards Rifle Corps made it possible to penetrate the German defenses near Pogoste on Mar. 15, driving 22km southwards to within 10km of Lyuban, but German re-deployments brought the advance to a halt by Mar. 31.Glantz, Leningrad, pp 172‚Äì73 The 54th Army, while liberating territory, was not successful in linking up with 2nd Shock Army, and the latter army was cut off and destroyed during the following months. Fedyuninsky was moved to command of 5th Army in April, and was replaced by Lt. Gen. A.V. Sukhomlin.Glantz, Leningrad, p xxi Operation Polyarnaya Zvezda 54th Army was only marginally involved in the Second Sinyavino Offensive during August ‚Äì October, and was engaged in mostly local fighting through the balance of 1942. At the beginning of 1943 its order of battle was as follows: * 115th Rifle Division * 177th Rifle Division * 198th Rifle Division * 281st Rifle Division * 285th Rifle Division * 294th Rifle Division * 311th Rifle Division * 6th Naval Infantry Brigade * 140th Rifle Brigade * 319th Guards Mortar Regiment * 461st Separate Antiaircraft Battalion * 124th Tank Brigade * 48th Separate Heavy Tank Battalion * 691 Sapper RegimentCombat composition of the Soviet Army (–ë–û–ï–í–û–ô –°–û–°–¢–ê–í –°–û–í–ï–¢–°–ö–û–ô –ê–†–ú–ò–ò), –ß–ê–°–¢–¨ III, (–Ø–Ω–≤–∞—Ä—å ‚Äì –¥–µ–∫–∞–±—Ä—å 1943 –≥.), p 10 On Jan. 12, Leningrad and Volkhov Fronts launched Operation Iskra, which by the end of the month had finally opened a land corridor to the besieged city, but this also did not directly involve the 54th. However, the success of Iskra, as well as the encirclement and destruction of German Sixth Army at Stalingrad and the subsequent offensives in the south, led STAVKA to plan a larger operation near Leningrad, to be called Operation Polyarnaya Zvezda (Pole Star), with the objective of the complete destruction of Army Group North.Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2009, p 403 The objective of 54th Army was to create a shallow encirclement, in conjunction with 55th Army from Leningrad, of the German forces still holding the Sinyavino ‚Äì Mga area. The army was to attack north of the village of Smerdynia in the direction of Tosno where it would meet the 55th; it would then attack towards Lyuban to divert the attention of German 18th Army from the deep encirclement being planned by Northwestern Front once its forces captured the Demyansk salient and its defenders.Glantz, After Stalingrad, p 405 The 54th was reinforced before the offensive, which it began on Feb. 10. Sukhomlin attacked the German 96th Infantry Division, which was recovering from the earlier fighting at Sinyavino, with four rifle divisions, three rifle brigades, and the 124th Tank Brigade, and yet only managed to penetrate 3 ‚Äì 4km on a 5km front in three days of heavy fighting. German reinforcements of small battlegroups from unengaged sectors brought the advance to a standstill; meanwhile, 55th Army was faring no better. On Feb. 27, STAVKA ordered Pole Star halted, as almost no progress had been made on any sector.Glantz, After Stalingrad, pp 412‚Äì14. On Mar. 11, Sukhomlin was demoted to deputy commander of the army, and Lt. Gen. S.V. Roginsky took over command, which he would hold until the army was disbanded. Leningrad‚ÄìNovgorod Offensive The front went back to relative inactivity for the remainder of 1943. At the beginning of October, after nearly two years of intermittent pressure, Army Group North evacuated the Kirishi salient to free up desperately needed reserves.Glantz, Leningrad, pp 319‚Äì20 In spite of this, the army group was in a very precarious position as the Soviet Fronts began planning a winter offensive. Prior to the offensive, 54th Army's order of battle comprised: 111th Rifle Corps, with: * 44th Rifle Division * 288th Rifle Division 115th Rifle Corps, with: * 281st Rifle Division * 285th Rifle Division * 14th and 53rd Rifle Brigades Independent Divisions: * 80th, 177th and 198th Rifle Divisions * 2nd Fortified Region * 124 Separate Tank Regiment * 107th and 501st Separate Tank Battalions * 48th Heavy Tank Battalion plus nine assorted regiments of artillery.Combat composition of the Soviet Army (–ë–û–ï–í–û–ô –°–û–°–¢–ê–í –°–û–í–ï–¢–°–ö–û–ô –ê–†–ú–ò–ò), –ß–ê–°–¢–¨ IV, (–Ø–Ω–≤–∞—Ä—å ‚Äì –¥–µ–∫–∞–±—Ä—å 1944 –≥.), p 9 The plan that was issued to Roginsky between October and December must have looked familiar: a drive westwards towards Tosno, Lyuban and Chudovo as part of a short encirclement, followed by an advance southwest to Luga. However, in the past year the German forces had grown weaker, the Soviets stronger, and the offensive would be launched on three attack axes.Glantz, Leningrad, pp 333‚Äì35 The first two of these, from Leningrad itself and from the Oranienbaum bridgehead, began on Jan. 14. 54th Army launched the third prong on the 16th: Roginsky led his attack with 80th Rifle Division and 115th Rifle Corps, adding 44th Rifle Division early on the 17th. Although the attack had only advanced 5km by Jan. 20, it was preventing German XXXVIII Army Corps from transferring forces to even harder-pressed sectors.Glantz, Leningrad, pp 341, 347 On Jan. 25 the army was reinforced with the new 119th Rifle Corps from 8th Army, and on the next night finally liberated Tosno, and reached the railroad southeast of Lyuban, forcing the Germans to abandon the latter. Two German corps were in danger of encirclement if the 54th could link up with 59th Army. By the end of the month, the prospect of trapping the entire 18th Army presented as Roginsky's troops advanced on Luga from the northeast. On the 30th, Hitler finally gave permission for 18th Army to pull back to the Luga River Defense Line, which was already compromised. The following day, 54th Army began pursuing XXXVIII Corps. 115th Rifle Corps advanced 75km in nine days and captured the town of Oredezh on Feb. 8. The next day, in a major regrouping, the 115th was transferred to 67th Army and Roginsky's headquarters redeployed to Novgorod to retake command of 111th as well as 119th Rifle Corps. Once this was complete, the army was ordered to penetrate the German defense west of Shimsk, thereafter advancing to Porkhov.Glantz, Leningrad, pp 360, 368‚Äì70, 385 At midnight, Feb. 13, Volkhov Front was disbanded, and 54th Army rejoined Leningrad Front. On the 17th this new command proposed that 54th and 8th Armies continue their offensive towards Ostrov, in order to breach the German Panther Line in that sector. The army resumed its offensive that day, aiming to take the Utorgosh ‚Äì Soltsy ‚Äì Shimsk line by the 19th, which would threaten the German X Corps, but that corps was successful in holding the line for three days as it withdrew. Following this, the 54th pursued for four days to a depth of 60km before liberating the town of Dno on Feb. 24, in conjunction with 1st Shock Army. Porkhov was taken on Feb. 26, and after another three days of combat and an advance of 65km, the army reached the Panther Line on Mar. 1, between Ostrov and Pskov.Glantz, Leningrad, pp 388, 395 During March and the first half of April, the depleted armies of Leningrad and 2nd Baltic Fronts were ordered into repeated attacks against this line, with meagre results reached at high cost. Finally, with even the weather against them, shortly after midnight on Apr. 18, Stalin ordered the Fronts onto the defense. The following day, 3rd Baltic Front was formed on the base of 20th Army headquarters, with 42nd, 67th and 54th Armies under command.Glantz, Leningrad, pp 408‚Äì10 Baltic Offensive and Disbandment During the following months 54th Army rebuilt its forces in anticipation of a summer offensive. This began to its south on June 22, with the launch of Operation Bagration. As Army Group Center reeled back from the Red Army's attack, a gap opened between it and Army Group North, which the latter could do little to mend as it was under pressure from holding attacks. Finally, 3rd Baltic Front joined the offensive on July 8, with the intention to breach the Panther Line and seize Ostrov and Pskov. By the 19th, German 16th Army had pulled back to a switch line called the Lithuania position, but Soviet forces kept going, and Pskov had to be given up on the 22nd.Earl F. Ziemke, Stalingrad to Berlin, Center of Military History U.S. Army, Washington, DC, 1968, pp 333‚Äì34 After the breaching of the Panther Line, 3rd Baltic Front was directed northwest both to retake Estonia and cut off retreating elements of Army Group North in the Tartu Offensive, and later the Riga Offensive. Although most of the German forces were able to escape (only to be bottled up in the Courland Pocket), the former objective was won. As these offensives drew to a close, it became apparent that 54th Army was no longer needed on a front that was contracting in length as it drew closer to Germany. Following the capture of Riga in mid-October, 3rd Baltic Front was disbanded, and 54th Army was removed to STAVKA reserves. On Dec. 13, Lt. Gen. Roginsky was placed in reserve; he would later briefly command 67th Army. On the last day of 1944, 54th Army was officially disbanded, and its forces were distributed to other formations.

It was built to commemorate the men of Oldham who were killed in the First World War. Bronze plaques on the wall of the churchyard nearby list the fallen, including Mabel Drinkwater, a nurse who died after an operation at Oldham Royal Infirmary. A mechanised roll of honour was added in the 1950s, listing the men from Oldham who were killed in the Second World War. The memorial became a Grade II listed building in 1973. The listing was upgraded to Grade II* in December 2016. Background and location After the end of the First World War, a campaign was started in 1919 to raise ¬£20,000 to build a war memorial in Oldham, and to endow educational scholarships for the children who lost a father, with the intention that any excess funds would be paid to Oldham Royal Infirmary (the hospital closed in 1989, and merged with Royal Oldham Hospital, its site later becoming the home for Oldham Sixth Form College). The memorial was commissioned in 1919 by the Oldham War Memorial Committee. It was designed and built by Thomas Taylor and the bronze sculpture was by Albert Toft. The siting of the memorial proved controversial: the first proposed site in the Market Place, close to some public lavatories, was rejected, and a second site by St Mary's Church was considered to be too close to a public house, the Greaves Arms. Other sites in Alexandra Park or close to the library were considered, before the decision was made to erect the memorial near St Mary's Church, opposite the Old Town Hall. Memorial The war memorial comprises a bronze group sculpture of five life-size soldiers in full battle dress and carrying their weapons, mounted on top of a high granite plinth. At a late stage, the sculpture group was rotated 180 degrees to face towards the town hall rather than the church. The soldiers are depicted as if making their way along trenches: one of the figures stands on top of the memorial, as if having climbed out of the trenches, encouraging his comrades to advance. The same figure used at the Royal Fusiliers War Memorial in London, and the 41st Division memorial at Flers in France. The plinth originally had a pair of bronze doors at either side, to the north and south, allowing access to a chamber inside housing the roll of honour of the 1st, 10th and 24th Battalions of the Manchester Regiment, and a space for private prayer. The south pair of doors was removed in the 1950s and replaced by glass window through which a mechanised roll of honour of the fallen from the Second World War can be viewed. An inscriptions over the south doors reads: \\"DEATH IS THE GATE OF LIFE / 1914‚Äì1918\\"; and one over the window on the south side reads: \\"TO GOD BE THE PRAISE \\". History The memorial was unveiled by General Sir Ian Hamilton on 28 April 1923, before a crowd estimated at over 10,000, and dedicated by the Bishop of Manchester, William Temple. It was designated as a Grade II listed building in 1973. It was cleaned and restored in 2012‚Äì13, and rededicated on 10 November 2013. In 2016, the memorial's listing was upgraded to II*.

Named after Bob Dylan's song Ballad of Hollis Brown, the band has become noted for their songwriting. Their music has been described as sounding \\"just as alive today as it would‚Äôve in 1966 and will 40 years from now.\\" History Hollis Brown was founded by singer and guitarist Mike Montali and guitarist Jonathan Bonilla in New York in 2009. Friends since high school, they collaborated as songwriters before the band was formed. Their name was taken from Bob Dylan's \\"The Ballad of Hollis Brown,\\" a song from his 1964 album The Times They Are a-Changin'. Bonilla later said the name was chosen because it sounded \\"very true to America, and because it comes from Bob Dylan, who‚Äôs the great American songwriter.\\" Former members of the band include Mike Wosczyk on bass, Mike Graves on drums and percussion, Dillon DeVito on bass, and Scott Thompson on bass. As of 2017 their current lineup includes Mike Montali and Jonathan Bonilla as the founders of the band. With them are Adam Bock on the keys, Andrew Zehnal on drums, and Chris Urriola on bass.  Music career  Hollis Brown began performing at New York clubs and had developed a significant regional following by the time they digitally released their 2009 debut EP, Nothing & the Famous No One. It was followed later that year by the self- released album Hollis Brown. Both records were positively received by the press, with No Depression writing \\"The band is tight, the lyrics can be inventive and memorable and the sparse production is just right.\\" Spin said that the band \\"fizz and pop like fatback on a greasy skillet.\\" In March 2013, after touring throughout the US with artists including Deer Tick and Lucero, Hollis Brown released Ride on the Train. Recorded over a ten-day period in Nashville, it was produced by Adam Landry and released on Alive Naturalsound Records. In addition to touring the US, the band embarked on their first European tour and further developed their sound. At a Lou Reed benefit show in New York, they played the Velvet Underground Loaded album in its entirety. One of the first records that Bonilla and Montali bonded over, the performance inspired them to record a track-by-track interpretation of Loaded entitled Hollis Brown Gets Loaded. Originally released in a vinyl limited edition of 500 to mark Record Store Day, the album sold out quickly, and was subsequently made more widely available. In 2014, with the lineup composed of Bonilla, Montali, Dillon Devito (bass, vocals), Andrew Zehnal (drums) and Adam Bock (keyboards and vocals), Hollis Brown began working on the album 3 Shots. It ultimately included the song \\"Rain Dance,\\" which was built on an unfinished Bo Diddley track. Preceded by an encounter with the head of the Diddley estate, who offered the band the opportunity to record a song using a track found in Diddley's home studio after his death, it premiered at a March 2015 event in New Orleans which commemorated the 60th Anniversary of the \\"Bo Diddley Beat.\\" Montali performed on Diddley's signature red square guitar 3 Shots evolved over a period of 18 months, with much of the songwriting taking place on the road. Most of the album was recorded by producer Don Dilego at his Velvet Elk home studio in the Pocono mountains, and mixed by John Agnello at Fluxivity Recording in Brooklyn, N.Y. In addition to the title track, 3 Shots featured the duet ‚ÄúHighway 1‚Äù with alt-country singer Nikki Lane. It was released on Jullian Records in April 2015. Later in 2015 Hollis Brown toured the US with Counting Crows, and once again returned to Europe. In 2016, the band‚Äôs vinyl EP, \\"Cluster of Pearls\\" was chosen as one of the 300 select releases throughout the world for Record Store Day. Pressed on Starburst Vinyl, the record was limited to 800 copies and features four previously unreleased tracks and two songs released on vinyl for the first time. It was released digitally on iTunes in August 2016. Their song ‚ÄúSteady Ground‚Äù is a featured exclusive on Amazon‚Äôs playlist Amazon Acoustics, which was released in fall 2016. Hollis Brown‚Äôs single ‚ÄúRun Right To You‚Äù was released on digitally and on limited edition 7‚Äù vinyl in October 2016 on Velvet Elk/One Little Indian records. The B-side features a live cover of the Jesse Malin song \\"She Don't Love Me Now\\". In addition to Counting Crows, Hollis Brown has toured with The Zombies, Citizen Cope, and Heartless Bastards. Their songs have been featured in the worldwide trailer for the Michael Keaton film ‚ÄúThe Founder‚Äù, MTV‚Äôs The Real World, Showtime‚Äôs Shameless, DirecTV's \\"Kingdom\\", the 2014 film Bad Country, which starred Willem Dafoe and Matt Dillon and an online ad campaign for Abercrombie & Fitch. The band's cover of the Cream song \\"Spoonful\\" appeared on the Alive Naturalsound 20th anniversary compilation Rock & Roll Is A Beautiful Thing, released in conjunction with Record Store Day 2015. In 2018, it was announced that the band had signed to Mascot Records, with a new album expected the following year.

The topic was criticism of the contemporary sexual double standards, in which it was socially acceptable for men to have premarital sexual experience, while women were expected to be virgins, and the contemporary view on prostitution, which was sanctioned as a \\"necessary evil\\" because of this double standard, an issue that had been raised by Svenska Federationen in 1878. The debate was divided in two sides: the moderate one, where Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson was the most known representative, wished to solve this double standard by demanding that men also be virgins on their wedding night, as women were. The radical one, where Edvard Brandes and Georg Brandes were the most known representatives, demanded that women be free to enjoy a sexual life prior to marriage, as men were. Getting Married (collection) by August Strindberg and the legal court case that surrounded it was one of the perhaps most known incidents during the debate. It also caused a debate within the literary world whether literature should touch these questions at all. Other well-known works in the debate are Henrik Ibsen's play A Doll's House (Et Dukkehjem), the novel Money (Pengar) by Viktoria Benedictsson, and the novel Pyrhussegrar by Stella Kleve.

Hoping to reconcile, Lara Jean heads over to Peter's house with a love letter she hopes for him to read. After a brief talk, the two almost kiss but his brother interrupts and then they decide they want to be a real couple. At school, Lara Jean discovers that someone has posted a video of her and Peter making out in the hot tub from the ski trip. A rumor spreads that the two were having sex. After seeing the video during school, Peter is furious and warns the anonymous poster not to mess with Lara Jean.

Included in their roster were Randy Meisner, who would go on to achieve fame with the Eagles and Poco in the 1970s, as well as Allen Kemp and Pat Shanahan, who later joined New Riders of the Purple Sage. History The Poor formed out of the remnants of the Soul Survivors, a garage rock group from Denver Colorado (not to be confused with the Philadelphia group), who had recorded several singles in 1965 and 1966. Allen Kemp, Pat Shanahan and John Day had been in the Soul Survivors. They moved to Los Angeles, California and when upon arriving teamed up with Randy Meisner, previously of the Esquires and later to gain fame in the Eagles and Poco, and Randy Naylor to form the Poor. They were able to sign under the management of Charlie Green and Brian Stone, who handled Sonny & Cher and Buffalo Springfield. They cut their debut single, \\"How Many Tears\\" b/w \\"Once Again,\\" which was released on the Loma label in October, 1966 and was produced by Barry Friedman, who had worked with Buffalo Springfield and Paul Butterfield. Freidman would produce their next two singles, including their follow-up \\"She's Got the Time, She's Got the Changes,\\" written by Tom Shipley and Michael Brewer, b/w \\"Love is Real\\" and \\"My Mind Goes High\\" b/w \\"Knowing You, Loving You,\\" which both were released on the York label in 1967. None of their records received much airplay except \\"She's Got the Time, She's Got the Changes,\\" which became a minor hit reaching #133 in the charts and has been described by music writer Bruce Eder as \\"...showing real garage punk attitude as well as a ton of virtuosity and style...\\" In May 1968, the group released a single on Decca Records \\"Feelin' Down\\" b/w \\"Come Back Baby,\\" but it failed to chart. The group broke up shortly thereafter. Following the breakup of the Poor, Meisner, Kemp, and Shanahan played Rick Nelson's backing group, the Stone Canyon Band. Kemp and Shanahan joined New Riders of the Purple Sage. Meisner would later join Poco, and soon became one of the founding members of popular 1970s rock group the Eagles. Day joined the short-lived group Two Guitars, Piano, Drum and Darryl. All of the Poor's singles were compiled on the 2003 CD compilation The Poor, which also includes the two singles by the Soul Survivors.

He was a professed religious from the Third Order of Saint Francis and co-founded his order in Rome alongside Nicola da Forca Palena. Pope Innocent XII beatified him on 9 November 1693. Life The pope approves the rule of Gambacorta. Pietro Gambacorta was born in the Republic of Pisa in 1355, the son of a government official and the brother of Chiara Gambacorti. His brothers were Lorenzo and Benedetto. His father and brothers were all killed on 21 October 1392. At age 22, he experienced a sudden conversion and decided to become a beggar. In 1380, he left home in favor of leading a life of begging and one of hermitage on Monte Cessano in the Umbria province, while also becoming a professed member of the Third Order of Saint Francis. He once converted a band of thieves to the faith and also rallied them to his life of hermitage, which laid the foundations to the Poor Hermits of Saint Jerome that he himself designed. These twelve thieves repented when they saw his austerity and piety. Pope Urban VI approved the rule for his hermitage while he was in Umbria. He co-established the order in Rome on a visit alongside Nicola da Forca Palena. The order received initial approval from Pope Martin V in 1420 and received full approval from Pope Eugene IV in 1446. He died on 17 June 1435, and his order was later dissolved under Pope Pius XI in 1933. His remains are housed in the church of Saint Jerome in Venice. Beatification Pope Innocent XII beatified him on 9 November 1693. References External links *Saints SQPN *Roman-Catholic-Saints *The Franciscan Book of Saints, Marion A.

Rain and Snow, also known as Cold Rain and Snow (Roud 3634), is an American folksong and in some variants a murder ballad. The song first appeared in print in Olive Dame Campbell and Cecil Sharp's 1917 compilation English Folk Songs from the Southern Appalachians, which relates that it was collected from Mrs. Tom Rice in Big Laurel, North Carolina in 1916. The melody is pentatonic. Campbell and Sharp's version collected only a single verse: :Lord, I married me a wife, She gave me trouble all my life, Made me work in the cold rain and snow. Rain and snow, rain and snow, Made me work in the cold rain and snow. Standard references * Roud 3634 Origin In 1965, Dillard Chandler recorded a graphic murder ballad version of the song that ends with the wife being shot by the husband. According to the liner notes on Chandler's album, Chandler learned the song from Berzilla Wallin, who said that the song related to a murder that had occurred in Madison County, North Carolina: :Well, I learned it from an old lady which says she was at the hanging of ‚Äì which was supposed to be the hanging, but they didn't hang him. They give him 99 long years for the killing of his wife... I heard the song from her in 1911. She was in her 50s at that time. It did happen in her girlhood... when she was a young girl... She lived right here around in Madison County. It happened here between Marshall and Burnsville; that's where they did their hanging at that time ‚Äì at Burnsville, North Carolina. That's all I know, except they didn't hang the man.' Subsequent performances have elaborated a variety of additional verses and variants beyond the single verse presented by Campbell and Sharp. Several verses consistently appear. Some sources for lyrics that appear in some later versions may be from Dock Boggs's 1927 song \\"Sugar Baby\\" (Roud 5731), another lament of a henpecked husband, which may have contributed a line about \\"red apple juice\\". A British folksong, The Sporting Bachelors (Roud 5556), contains similar themes, but was collected in the 1950s. Earlier possible precursors include a series of broadside ballads on the general subject of \\"Woeful Marriage\\"; one frequently reprinted nineteenth-century example begins with the words \\"On Monday night I married a wife\\", (Roud 1692). These British antecedents mostly share common themes and inspirations; the song originated in the local tradition of Big Laurel, Madison County, and relate to a nameless murderer who committed the crime at some time between the end of the Civil War and the end of the nineteenth century. A recent origin is also suggested by the relatively limited number of variations on the tune; most performances use the Campbell-Sharp melody as written. Despite the apparent violence of the lyrics, women feature prominently in the oral tradition of the song. It was collected from \\"Mrs. Tom Rice\\", and sung by Berzilla Wallin, who learned it from \\"an old lady\\" who remembered the murder trial the song was about.' Variants and performances Made me work in the cold rain and snow. Painting by Cornelius Krieghoff. The song is closely associated with the Grateful Dead; a studio version appeared on their first album The Grateful Dead (1967), and the song was a standard part of the Dead's repertoire throughout their career. They would often open with the song, or perform it early in the first set. Unlike Chandler's recording, in the Dead's version of the lyrics the husband generally laments his mistreatment at his greedy wife's hands, but does not kill her. The lyrics from the Grateful Dead's version were adapted from an earlier recording by Obray Ramsey. Towards the end of his life, Benjamin Britten orchestrated the one-verse 1917 version of the song; this appears as the first section \\"Lord I married me a wife\\" of his Eight Folk Song Arrangements from 1976. The song became a part of the bluegrass music tradition, and was recorded by Bill Monroe and also by the Del McCoury Band. Other performers who have recorded the song include Peter Rowan with Tony Rice (on the Quartet album),and Molly Tuttle, who created her own version of the final verse. Sam Amidon, PentanglePentangle.

History and culture Lady on the Rock According to tradition, when the Mataatua waka first arrived at WhakatƒÅne from Hawaiki 600 years ago, the men left the women alone in the canoe while they went to visit the shore. The canoe started to drift back out to sea. Wairaka, the daughter of captain- navigator Toroa, seized the paddle, and brought the wake back to shore. She forbade the tapu forbidding women to handle canoes, shouting \\"Kia Whakatane au i ahau\\", translating as \\"I will act the part of a man\\"; this phrase is the origin of WhakatƒÅne's name. Other traditions suggest it was Muriwai, Toroa's sister, who had brought the canoe to shore. The Lady on the Rock statue, a bronze statue at the top of the Turuturu Rock at the mouth of the Whakatane River, commemorates the bravery of Wairaka. It was unveiled in 1965 as a memorial to the wife of Sir William Sullivan. Local MƒÅori The area is within the rohe (tribal area) of the NgƒÅti Awa iwi.

The conference addressed the issue of securing religious liberty for the future. At the conference, Swanson spoke about a Biblical mandate of the death penalty for homosexuality, stating that both the Old and New Testament cover the \\"sin of homosexuality\\" and that in Romans 1 Paul the Apostle affirms that it is worthy of capital punishment. In the same speech, he stated that he was not calling for these biblical injunctions to be enacted in America \\"because homosexuals need time to repent\\" and \\"America needs time to repent\\". Rather than read J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books he urged \\"America, repent of Harry Potter.

The existence of homosexuality is an explanation for terrorist incidents, according to Swanson. On his June 16, 2016 radio show, he said the Orlando nightclub shooting was caused because of general sinfulness, quoting a section of Romans 1 commonly cited to condemn homosexuality: \\"God gave them over to a reprobate mind.\\" He then quoted Jesus' words in Matthew 15:19: \\"For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, slander\\", and concluded that \\"man has a heart problem\\". He also compared the incident to a mass killing mentioned in Luke 13, to which Jesus responded \\"unless you repent you will likewise perish\\". Swanson said that \\"humble homosexuals that fall on their faces and plead for God's mercy as the publican did in the parable will go to heaven\\" and \\"proud gays will go to hell\\". He believes the Borg (in the Star Trek franchise) has demonic power. In 2014, he said the Disney film Frozen (2013) was the work of the devil and persuades young women to be lesbians.

It is referred to as the foundation of the women's organisation within the social democratic worker's movement in Sweden. It was the first social democratic women's club to be officially a part of the party, and the first of many local clubs of the same kind. The Club organized the social democratic women within the Swedish working class movement by establishing local women's clubs and enlisting working women in the trade unions. History Background The first Democratic Socialist Club for women in Sweden was the Kvinnliga arbetarklubben, which was founded by Elma Danielsson in Malm√∂ in 1888. It was regarded as the starting point of the Social Democratic women's movement in Sweden. However, it was temporary and it was never formally a part of the Swedish Social Democratic Party (which was not founded until a year later). While women were accepted as members of the Swedish Social Democratic Party from its foundation in 1889, due to the efforts of Alina J√§gerstedt, the party did not initially encourage the foundation of a separate women's organisation within the party. Women's issues were not to be separated from other issues of equality, such as worker's rights, and it was seen as a given thing that women's rights were to be automatically included in the worker's rights movement, hence no need for a separate organisation for women's rights. Local women's socialist clubs never became other more than temporary. Foundation On 11 June 1892, a meeting was held by Social Democratic women in Stockholm to discuss the issue. The meeting resulted in the foundation of the . In contrast to the previous local Women's Socialist clubs, it was an official part of the Swedish Social Democratic Party from the start, and thus the beginning of the organized Swedish Social Democratic women's movement. Fifty-eight women were among the signatures of the foundation of the Club, among them several known women pioneers such as Alina J√§gerstedt, who had been instrumental in the inclusion of women in the Swedish Social Democratic Party from its foundation; Lotten J√§derlund, Elsa L√∂fgren, Elin Engstr√∂m, Gertrud M√•nsson and Anna S√∂derberg. The opening speech was held by Emilie Rathou, who had been the first female 1 May-speaker the previous year. They were soon joined by other well known profiles such as Kata Dalstr√∂m, Anna Sterky, Anna Lindhagen and Amanda Horney. Women's Agitation Committee In 1897, the club founded the Kommitt√©n f√∂r den kvinnliga agitationen ('Women's Agitation Committee'), with the purpose of training women trade unionists who could convince women workers to join the trade unions. In 1903, the Women's Agitation Committee was dissolved and transformed to a trade union for women under the name Women's Trade Union: at also published the Social Democratic women's magazine Morgonbris from 1904. Women Suffrage Between 1902 and 1921, the Club collaborated with the National Association for Women's Suffrage: its foremost representatives in the suffrage movement were Anna Lindhagen and Ruth Gustafson.Barbro Hedwall (2011).

(Swedish) Internationally the Socialist- and labour movement did not generally support cooperation with the First wave women's movement, because it was seen as a given thing that women's rights were to be included in the struggle for worker's rights and the Socialist movement. The Swedish Social Democratic women became an exception when they chose to collaborate with the National Association for Women's Suffrage and its local branches: they became valuable ally, as they already had a network of well organized local women's club all over the nation.Lindgren, Anne-Marie & Lindgren √Ösbrink, Marika, Systrar, kamrater!: arbetarr√∂relsens kvinnliga pionj√§rer, Id√© och tendens, Stockholm, 2007 During World War I, the Club also supported the pacifist association founded by the suffrage association.Barbro Hedwall (2011).

(Swedish) Women's Congress One of the most important tasks of the Club was to organize local women's clubs all over the country. From January 1907 onward, the Club arranged a national women's congress (Kvinnokongressen), attended by representatives from each local club, every third year. In 1920 all local women's club, including the Stockholm Club, united to replace the Women's Congress by one organisation: the Social Democratic Women in Sweden.

Life Logori was born in 1871 in Kor√ß√´, back then still part of the Vilayet of Monastir of the Ottoman Empire. Like many other people from his region, he had to emigrate at a young age. Logori settled in Egypt at the age of 13. There he received his education; Logori graduated from the French Lyceum of Alexandria. He was actively involved in the Albanian patriotic circles there. He maintained contacts with members of the Albanian √©migr√© community in Bucharest, Istanbul, Italy, and Brussels. In 1909, he represented the colony of Egypt in the Congress of Elbasan, where the foundations of the Albanian education were set. He lived in Egypt for most of hist life (58 years). In 1929, he came to Albania with an invitation from the Albanian government of the time. He positively responded to the invitation, left Egypt and settled in Durres. Unfortunately he died the same year. As an entrepreneur Logori was a successful businessman in Egypt. By that time Egypt experienced a massive economic development and prosperity, French and British investments (i.e. the Suez Canal), modernization, and opportunity for entrepreneurship. Together with his nephew Milo Du√ßi, he emerged as an important player in the economic development of Egypt's Delta region directed by Lord Cromer's office. By 1901, he started working with his well-connected uncle Loni Logori on projects that explicitly tied the commercial interest of the British administration and the local landowners. Logori built much of the canal network in the Minah District. As a poet Logori is the author of many lyrical poetry and songs in Albanian, as \\"Drenovarja\\" (The girl from Drenova), \\"Vemi o vemi\\" (Let's go, let's go), \\"Celu √ßelu\\" (Open up). He also covered alternated thematic as the national heroes (songs for Papa Kristo Negovani, Spiro Kosturi, etc.). As a translator, he translated from French the Le Cid of Pierre Corneille. Logori also attempted several times in writing a national anthem for Albania. In fact, one of its first attempts was called \\"Royal Anthem\\" (Alb: Hymni Mbretnor) and was found in the catalogs of Victor Records. It was recorded on 28 March 1918, in New York City, interpreted by the tenor Giuseppe Mauro, while the performing orchestra was directed by Nathaniel Shilkret, and the lyrics by Logori.

Genera Orchidacearum, which is currently the definitive work on orchid taxonomy, delimits Disinae as consisting of two closely related genera, Disa and Schizodium, and it places Disinae in the mostly African tribe Diseae, along with four other subtribes: Brownleeinae, Huttonaeinae, Coryciinae, and Satyriinae.Alec M. Pridgeon, Phillip J. Cribb, Mark W. Chase, and Finn N. Rasmussen. 1999-2014. Genera Orchidacearum Oxford University Press. (volume 1), (volume 2), (volume 3), (volume 4), (volume 5), (volume 6) In the classification for orchids that was published by Chase et alii in 2015, Schizodium was placed in synonymy under Disa, while Pachites and Huttonaea were transferred to Disinae.Mark W. Chase, Kenneth M. Cameron, John V. Freudenstein, Alec M. Pridgeon, Gerardo A. Salazar, C√°ssio van den Berg, and Andr√© Schuiteman. 2015. \\"An updated classification of Orchidaceae\\". Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society 177(2):151-174. (See External links below). In Genera Orchidacearum, Pachites and Satyrium form the subtribe Satyriinae, and Huttonaea is the sole genus in the subtribe Huttonaeinae. The transfer of Pachites and Huttonaea to Disinae by Chase et alii (2015) was done with considerable doubt, and was based upon uncertainty about the relationships of these two genera. In 2009, a molecular phylogenetic study found only weak statistical support for a sister relationship between Huttonaea and Disa.Richard J. Waterman, Anton Pauw, Timothy G. Barraclough, and Vincent Savolainen. 2009. \\"Pollinators underestimated: A molecular phylogeny reveals widespread floral convergence in oil-secreting orchids (sub-tribe Coryciinae) of the Cape of South Africa\\". Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 51(1):100-110. . Disinae was covered, along with the rest of the tribe Diseae, in volume 2 of Genera Orchidacearum, which was published in 2001. Molecular phylogenetic studies published after 1999 showed that Diseae was paraphyletic over another tribe, Orchideae.Emmanuel J. P. Douzery, Alec M. Pridgeon, Paul Kores, H. P.

It was active from 1884 to 1891. It published the radical magazine Fram√•t (Forward). G√∂teborgs Kvinnof√∂rening was founded 30 October 1884 by a group of liberal upper class women in Gothenburg under the leadership of Mathilda Hedlund (chairperson 1884‚Äì88), the daughter of the radical liberal publicist Sven Adolf Hedlund, and had 89 members during its first year. It was founded as a local answer to Fredrika Bremer Association, which was founded in Stockholm the same year. Its purpose was to work for reforms in women's rights and the position of women in society through information and debate. The association organized a library for women; educational lectures for poor women; an employment agency for women; offered meals to poor women; arranged for vacation trips for school children; offered meals for poor children; organized a pension fund which paid for sick leave for women; organized the charity secondhand store chain Myrorna; and founded a society for women's gymnastics. It debated important issues for women such as the dress reform, and organized protests against the regulated prostitution in line with the Svenska Federationen. In 1886, the association published the radical women's magazine Fram√•t, with Alma √Ökermark as editor. Later that same year, however, √Ökermark participated in the Sedlighetsdebatten by publishing articles of sexual liberation for women, such as the novel Pyrrhussegrar by Stella Kleve. This caused a scandal, and though √Ökermark were supported by some of the members, such as the chairperson Mathilda Hedlund, the members voted to withdraw their support to the paper in November with a marginal of nine votes ‚Äì √Ökermark managed to publish the paper for three more years, however. The chairperson, Mathilda Hedlund, left Sweden for Denmark after her marriage in 1888, and G√∂teborgs Kvinnof√∂rening was dissolved in 1891. Many of the activities founded by it continued, however, and in 1903, it was succeeded by the local Gothenburg branch of the National Association for Women's Suffrage, founded and chaired by Frigga Carlberg, previously a leading member of the G√∂teborgs Kvinnof√∂rening.

It was led by Prime Minister Alfred Deakin, from 24 September 1903 until 27 April 1904. Deakin was the second Prime Minister of Australia, but served as Prime Minister again from 1905‚Äì1908 and 1909‚Äì1910 ‚Äì see Second Deakin Government and Third Deakin Government. Background The Commonwealth of Australia came into being when the Federal Constitution was proclaimed by the Governor-General, Lord Hopetoun, on 1 January 1901. The first Federal elections were held in March 1901 and resulted in a narrow plurality for the Protectionist Party over the Free Trade Party with the Australian Labor Party (ALP) polling third. Labor declared it would offer support to the party which offered concessions and Edmund Barton's Protectionists formed a government, with Alfred Deakin as Attorney-General. Alfred Deakin Edmund Barton (left), the first Prime Minister of Australia, with Alfred Deakin, the second Prime Minister. Alfred Deakin (1856‚Äì1919) ‚Äì a barrister, journalist and important Federation era politician ‚Äì was born in Melbourne in 1856. He first entered the Victorian Parliament as a Liberal in 1879. He attended all the official Federal conferences and conventions working towards federation of Britain's Australian colonies, and was skilled at brokering compromises. He played a significant part in shaping the Australian Constitution, and arguing the case for unity of the colonies.http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/deakin-alfred-5927 Deakin was a fine orator and major player in the establishment of the institutions of Australian Democracy, and served three times in the office of Prime Minister during the first ten years of Australia's Federation.http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/deakin/index.aspx Term of office Alfred Deakin became Prime Minister after Edmund Barton resigned to become a judge on the first High Court of Australia. In the First Deakin Ministry, Deakin also took up the post of Minister for External Affairs, while James Drake became Attorney General and George Turner was appointed Treasurer. Austin Chapman became Minister for Defence, and William Lyne took (Trade and Customs).http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/deakin/in-office.aspx The first Deakin Government failed to pass any legislation in the newly formed Australian Federal Parliament. The Protectionists' shaky coalition with the Australian Labor Party did not long survive the December 1903 Election, and by the resumption of Parliament in March 1904, the Deakin Government had fallen, amid a dispute over a Labor Party amendment to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. Aftermath The early years of Federation saw a volatile political environment. The first Deakin Government ended on 27 April 1904, making way for the first Australian Labor Party government of Australia, led by Chris Watson. In August that year, the Protectionists split with radical liberals, Isaac Isaacs and William Lyne, aligning with the Labor Party against the Free Trade Party of George Reid.

The building in which it is located opened as the city's Fort Worth and Denver South Plains Railway depot in 1928. In 1996, the City of Lubbock obtained a sizable collection of Holly-related artifacts from his estate, and the next year it purchased the former depot. In 1999, the new Buddy Holly Center opened as the home of the newly acquired Buddy Holly collection as well as a replacement for the city's Fine Arts Center, which had been established in 1984. The Center features a permanent gallery for the Buddy Holly collection, which showcases artifacts and documents from Holly's childhood as well as his professional career, as well as the Texas Musician Hall of Fame, the Lubbock Fine Arts Gallery, and three additional visual arts galleries that host traveling exhibits. In 2002, an oversized sculpture of Holly's distinctive horn-rimmed glasses was installed outside the Center's main entrance, and in 2013 Crickets drummer Jerry Allison's restored house was relocated to the site and opened to the public.  History   Building  The Fort Worth and Denver South Plains Railway Depot building in 2013 The building in which the Buddy Holly Center is located opened as Lubbock's Fort Worth and Denver South Plains Railway depot in 1928. It was designed by Fort Worth-based architect Wyatt C. Hedrick in the Spanish Renaissance Revival style. The depot, which provided the city with both passenger and freight service, was the largest built on the Lubbock‚ÄìEstelline branch of the Fort Worth and Denver, itself a subsidiary of the Burlington Route. It operated as a railroad station until 1953, when it was closed and subsequently used for salvaging and warehousing. In 1976, the building was reopened as the Depot Restaurant, which is regarded by the City of Lubbock as \\"one of the first successful examples of adaptive use in the city\\". In 1979, it became the first structure to be designated a Lubbock Historic Landmark by the Lubbock City Council, and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. The restaurant closed in 1997, and later that year the city purchased the former depot.  Center  Holly's Fender Stratocaster on display In 1984, the City of Lubbock established a Fine Arts Center; although it developed successful artistic and popular programs, it was housed in \\"an aging structure that was never intended for museum or gallery functions\\". In 1996, the city obtained a large number of Buddy Holly-related artifacts from his estate. The next year the city then purchased the recently closed Depot Restaurant, and began restoring, renovating, and expanding it into a facility that could both replace the Fine Arts Center and serve as a home for its newly acquired Buddy Holly collection. The original depot building was restored to its original specifications, and while the addition was largely built to match it, it also features a frieze with steel forms shaped like Holly's iconic Fender Stratocaster electric guitar. The new Buddy Holly Center, envisioned as a municipal performance and visual arts center dedicated to Holly as well as the music of Lubbock and West Texas more broadly, opened on September 3, 1999, four days before Holly's birthday. The guitar-shaped permanent gallery of the Buddy Holly collection is featured alongside the Center's other attractions: the Texas Musician Hall of Fame (which often features temporary exhibits dedicated to West Texas musicians), the Lubbock Fine Arts Gallery, and three additional visual arts galleries that host traveling exhibits. In May 2002, an oversized sculpture of Holly's distinctive horn-rimmed glasses created by Steve Teeters was installed next to the Center's main entrance. In 2010, the western wing of the Center underwent a major renovation that resulted in the replacement of doors and windows, the repointing of exterior bricks and stone, new flooring, lighting, and paint for the interior gallery space, the removal of freestanding exhibit walls, the addition of black-out shades to windows to protect artifacts from exposure to sunlight, and a new permanent education space. Crickets drummer Jerry Allison's house, which had previously been restored and then relocated to the site of the Buddy Holly Center, opened to the public for the first time on September 7, 2013. The structure, which was where Allison and Holly wrote many of their songs, is available for tours.  Collection  Buddy Holly's horn-rimmed glasses on display The Buddy Holly Center's Buddy Holly collection, which the City of Lubbock acquired in 1996, is headlined by the Fender Stratocaster that Holly played during his final concert and the pair of glasses that he was wearing at the time of his death. It also includes numerous other artifacts from his career as a professional musician, including a recording microphone, performing outfits, a guitar strap customized by Holly himself, and numerous albums. Furthermore, the collection includes numerous photographs (both promotional and personal in nature) as well as documents, such as postcards, fan mail, original tour itineraries, and business cards. A handwritten letter from Holly to A.V. Bamford and correspondence with Decca Records are among the numerous letters in the collection. Various artifacts and documents from Holly's childhood, including homework assignments, a slingshot, a leather-crafting kit, and his personal collection of 45-rpm records are also on public display. The Center also has Holly's 1958 Ariel Cyclone motorcycle on long-term loan from Lubbockite George McMahan; after Holly's death, the motorcycle was owned by country musicians Waylon Jennings and Jessi Colter before being sold at auction.  Exhibits and events  Patricia Vonne performed at the Center in August 2015 Temporary exhibits hosted by the Buddy Holly Center have included visual arts exhibitions showcasing subjects ranging from underwater photography to watercolors from children's literature. In October 2014, Paul McCartney played a concert at the Center, during which he recounted Holly's musical influence on the Beatles. It also hosts an annual Summer Showcase Concert Series, which offers free performances in its Meadows Courtyard from May to August featuring bands of various musical genres, including rock, rhythm and blues, funk, soul, country, metal, and mariachi. In August 2015, Latin roots rock musician Patricia Vonne played a concert in the Meadows Courtyard. The Buddy Holly Center offers free admission, as well as free trolley tours of various Holly- related sites in Lubbock, on February 3, \\"The Day the Music Died\\" (the day Holly was killed in an airplane crash along with Ritchie Valens and J.P. \\"The Big Bopper\\" Richardson). The Center has also waived admission fees for other occasions, including for its participation in the City of Lubbock's First Friday Art Trail (on multiple occasions, including in August 2011, May 2015, and August 2015), as well as on the occasion of its 15th anniversary in September 2014. The Center has additionally hosted various other community events, including workshops on wire drawings, a Music, Art and Drama Camp open to children between the ages of 8 and 12, and various Day of the Dead events, including an art gallery, a family art workshop, and a concert by a Tejano band.

ATAP is similar to X, but works on projects, granting project leaders time‚Äîpreviously only two years‚Äîin which to move a project from concept to proven product. According to Dugan, the ideal ATAP project combines technology and science, requires a certain amount of novel research, and creates a marketable product. Historically, the ATAP team was born at Motorola and kept when Google sold Motorola to Lenovo; for this reason, ATAP ideas have tended to involve mobile hardware technology. The team embodies principles that former Google VP Dugan used at DARPA,. One of these principles is to create small teams of high performers. Another is to make use of resources outside the organizational box; ATAP has worked with hundreds of partners in more than twenty countries, including schools, corporations, startups, governments, and nonprofits. Standing contracts are in place with a number of top-flight schools, such as Stanford, MIT, and Caltech, to facilitate rapid research arrangements when needed.  Projects  Although ATAP has occasionally publicized the number of projects in progress, the individual projects are kept secret until they are nearing maturity and it's time to start developing public interest. At that point, they've historically been announced at the annual Google I/O developer conference. Some of the announced projects to date are described below.  Project Tango  The Project Tango team was led by computer scientist Johnny Lee, a core contributor to Microsoft's Kinect. Project Tango is a computer-vision technology that allows mobile devices to detect their position relative to the world around them, without requiring GPS or other external signals. This enables the use of mobile phones and tablets for indoor navigation, 3D mapping, measurement of physical spaces, recognition of known environments, augmented reality, and windows into virtual 3D worlds. In the first quarter of 2015, the team left ATAP and became a Google team in its own right, making Project Tango the first product to emerge from the intensive two-year incubator process.  Project Ara  Project Ara is a platform for creating customizable, modular smartphones. With Project Ara, consumers populate an electronic frame, called an endoskeleton or \\"endo\\", with rectangular hardware modules for power, processing, memory, screen, wireless, and other functionality. Consumers assemble basic modules to create a working device, then add or remove additional modules as desired ‚Äì in some cases, even while the device is operating. Optional modules include cameras, speakers, large data storage, and medical sensors. Since users can update individual modules when better technology becomes available, Project Ara provides a hedge against cyclical obsolescence. It also reduces the purchase price of a low-end cell phone, by creating the option of buying only the most basic features. This may support the spread of technology in economically-disadvantaged areas. The official Project Ara website specifies a targeted manufacturing cost for an entry-level device in the $50-$100 range, and states that the project has \\"the goal of delivering the mobile internet to the next 5 billion people\\". Google had targeted the first Project Ara public release for Puerto Rico in 2015, but announced that the test has been delayed until 2016. A Project Ara Module Development Kit (MDK) will enable manufacturers to create Project Ara- compatible modules. An early pre-release version of the MDK is available on the Project Ara website. ATAP sponsored Project Ara Developer's Conferences in 2014 and 2015 to begin stimulating interest in the emerging hardware ecosystem and solicit input from potential designers and manufacturers. Ara is an exception in that the usual ATAP two-year timeframe was extended to give more time for the project's completion. However, at the time of the extension team leader Paul Eremenko was replaced by Rafa Camargo, named by CNET in 2015 as one of the Top 20 Latinos in Tech.  Project Soli  Project Soli is a new gesture-recognition technology based on radar, unlike established approaches based on visual or infrared light such as stereo cameras, structured light, or time-of-flight sensors. This novel approach, which uses small, high-speed sensors and data-analysis techniques such as Doppler, can detect fine motions with sub-millimeter accuracy. Thus, for instance, Project Soli technology enables a user to issue commands to a computer by rubbing a thumb and forefinger together in pre-defined patterns. Applications might include sensors embedded in clothing, switches that don't require physical contact, and accessibility technology. The project is headed by Ivan Poupyrev, a former scientist for Disney Imagineering who was named one of Fast Company's \\"100 Most Creative People in Business 2013\\". Project Soli was announced at Google I/O 2015 and generated considerable media interest. According to the official site, in 2015 the team was preparing to make an alpha Project Soli development kit available to a limited number of developers, with plans for signing people up for a larger beta release later that year. At Google I/O 2016, Google demoed a newer Project Soli chip redesigned for smartwatches and speakers with Infineon Technologies. The chip was 3x smaller, with 22x lower power consumption (down from 1.2 to 0.054 W) and 256x more efficient computational power capable of up to 18,000 frames per second. The Pixel 4, released in 2019, is the first commercial smartphone to feature Project Soli for Motion sensing. The Pixel 4's Soli radar system is a single 5.0 mm x 6.5 mm RFIC.  Project Jacquard  Another novel user-input technology, from the same team responsible for Project Soli, is Project Jacquard, a platform for embedding sensors and feedback devices in fabrics and clothing in ways that seem natural and comfortable. The platform encompasses techniques for creating fashion fabrics with conductive fibers woven into them, plus small, flexible computing components and feedback devices (such as haptics or LEDs), along with software APIs that applications can use to exchange data with the garment. In one basic use-case, users can provide input to a mobile phone by touching or stroking the garment in a designated location, and can receive alerts through vibrations, sounds, or lights in the garment. With an embedded Project Soli sensor built into the garment, the application can also recognize finger gestures or other signals. The name \\"Jacquard\\" is borrowed from the Jacquard loom, invented in 1801, which could be controlled with punched cards and inspired the use of punched cards in computing more than a century later. Like the loom, ATAP's Project Jacquard is a platform, not a consumer product; it enables the creation of products for uses such as communication, personal assistance, navigation, health and fitness, fashion, and work. To date, demos and marketing materials emphasize style and quality, as opposed to a purely sports-based or utilitarian positioning. Project Jacquard was announced at Google I/O 2015, and at the same time Google announced a related partnership with clothing manufacturer Levi Strauss & Co. to create Jacquard-enabled jackets. The jackets were released in 2017 with mixed reviews about the jacket's overall usefulness. According to the ATAP website, designers can use Jacquard \\"as they would any fabric, adding new layers of functionality to their designs, without having to learn about electronics.\\" The site goes on to say \\"We are also developing custom connectors, electronic components, communication protocols, and an ecosystem of simple applications and cloud services.\\" A developer's kit or product release date have not been announced. In September 2019, Yves Saint Laurent announced their Cit-E backpack featuring Jacquard technology for touch gestures. In October 2019, Google announced a new collaboration with Levi Strauss & Co. to release a new edition of its Jacquard-enabled jackets. The jackets will be available in the U.S., Australia, France, Germany, Italy, the U.K. and Japan. On March 10, 2020, Adidas and EA Sports announced GMR, a smart insole featuring a Jacquard Tag. The Jacquard Tag uses machine learning algorithms to recognize kicks, shot power, distance and speed. It connects with FIFA Mobile for challenges and leaderboards.

Built in the 1840s as a school, it later served as a church, town hall, and library. It is now a museum operated by the local historical society, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Description and history The District No. 2 School is located in Passadumkeag Village, at the northeast corner of Pleasant Street and Caribou Road, a short way east of Main Street (United States Route 2). It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a gable roof, clapboard siding, and a rubblestone foundation. Its main facade has a hip-roofed porch sheltering the entrance, supported by clustered columns. The entrance is flanked by fixed-sash windows, with a movable sash window in the gable above the porch. A square tower rises above the entrance, with a louvered belfry topped by a small spire surrounded by a pinnacled balustrade. The interior is composed of a large main room, which occupies the front two-thirds of the building, and a smaller room at the rear. The schoolhouse was built sometime in the 1840s, and served the town's district encompassing its village center until 1902. It also served as a meeting place for local Baptist and Congregational churches until c. 1905. In 1915 the building was converted for use as a library, at which time the porch and interior room layout were added.

He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1951 to 1958 who represented the northern Ontario riding of Cochrane North. He was a cabinet minister in the government of Leslie Frost. He was implicated in the Northern Ontario Natural Gas and was forced to resign from cabinet. Background Kelly was born in Baysville in Northern Ontario, the son of Timothy Kelly and Mary Tooke. He went to school in Bracebridge and worked as an accountant for Abitibi Power and Paper Company for twenty years. He and his wife Ethel raised four children. Politics He was elected in the 1951 provincial election in the riding of Cochrane North. He defeated Liberal candidate J.A. Habel by 476 votes. He was re-elected in 1955. In 1952, he was appointed as Minister of Mines by Premier Leslie Frost during a minor cabinet shuffle. Northern Ontario Natural Gas In the early 1950s, Trans-Canada Pipeline was building a natural gas pipeline eastward across Canada. When it reached Ontario, it said that it would not build branch pipelines to individual communities and sought local Ontario companies to provide that service. Kelly's nephew, Gordon McLean co-founded a company called Northern Ontario Natural Gas (NONG) to supply natural gas to northern Ontario communities. While Kelly did not own shares in the company, he gave $5,000 to McLean for startup funds in NONG and made an agreement with McLean to share any profits. When TCPL announced their intention to build the pipeline through Ontario, Premier Frost recognized this as a prominent issue and order his cabinet not to become financially involved in the pipeline business. Kelly ignored this directive and in addition gave advice to fellow cabinet ministers Clare Mapledoram and William Griesinger to purchase shares in the company. He also shared the advice with John Wintermeyer who was leader of the Ontario Liberal Party. By 1957, NONG had cornered the natural gas market in Northern Ontario. Shares in the company were split 500 to 1. Kelly's initial investment of $5,000 soared to $500,000. Kelly and McLean's investment became so involved that they created holding company called Kelmac Oils to help manage their money. Word of Kelly's business dealings reached the Premier's office who felt that \\"it was not appropriate for the Minister of Mines to dispense 'hot tips'\\". On July 8, 1957, Frost ordered Kelly to come to his office and asked for his resignation from cabinet. Reports in the newspapers at the time said that Kelly cited business pressures as the reason. He later admitted that the NONG situation was the real reason for leaving cabinet. Some reports said that Frost had Kelly's resignation already typed up before the meeting but Kelly wrote the resignation himself. News of NONG became public in March 1958 when Donald MacDonald the leader of the Ontario CCF accused Frost of collusion in the affair. Frost denied the allegations but information about the stock holdings of his cabinet ministers was revealed. Kelly resigned his seat in January 1958. Cabinet posts Later life After leaving the Ontario legislature, Kelly attempted to run as a candidate in the upcoming federal election but he failed to win a nomination. In 1965, he became leader of the provincial Social Credit party for a brief period, and ran unsuccessfully as an independent candidate in the riding of Cochrane in the 1965 federal election. He moved to Smooth Rock Falls near Cochrane where he bought and operated a hotel. He served as a town councillor for seven years and was mayor for two terms. He died in 1985 at the age of 83.

It is easily distinguished from others in the genus by the combination of glabrous leaves and branches, its opposite leaf arrangement and its serrated leaves. Its distribution is restricted to the extreme south-west of Western Australia. Description Myoporum oppositifolium is an erect shrub which grows to a height of and has glabrous branches which usually have raised, wart-like tubercles. The leaves are also tuberculate, especially on the lower surface and are arranged in opposite pairs. The leaves are egg-shaped to narrow lance-shaped, long, wide and the leaf margins are serrated for their entire length. The flowers appear in groups of one to four in the axils of the leaves on a stalk long. The flowers have 5 green or purplish sepals and 5 petals joined at their bases to form a tube. The tube is white, spotted purple on the bases of the lobes and on the top part of the tube, long, the lobes spreading and long. There are 4 stamens which extend slightly beyond the petals. Flowering occurs throughout the whole year and is followed by lilac to brown fruits which are drupes, in diameter and roughly spherical in shape. Taxonomy and naming Myoporum oppositifolium was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown and the description was published in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae. The specific epithet (oppositifolium) is derived from the Latin words oppositus, meaning \\"standing opposite\\" and folium, meaning \\"leaf\\".Backer, C.A. (1936).

Description  The quill mites are from the family Syringophilidae. Although little is known about these parasitic mites, 33 species have been discovered, most prevalently in North America. They are all ectoparasites and they are usually found in birds from the order Passeriformes (comprising approximately 32 specific bird species). Their life cycle is simple since they are monoxenous organisms that sexually reproduce and eat within the feather of their hosts.  Morphology  The genus Syringophilopsis is one of the most diverse of this family with over 33 identified species. Females have harpoon finger-like digits in their chelicerae, three teeth in their hypostomal apex which is ornamented by 1 or 2 protuberances. In males, the hysteronotal shield can be present, absent, free or fused. Both genders possess a propodontal shield and they are both relatively large in comparisons of other mites in the family Syringophilidae.  Evolution  There is not a lot known about the diversification of quill mites. It is well studied that the specific host in which a parasite occupies directly influences the cospeciation between both organisms. Using RNA, Hendricks et al. determined that there is a degree a significant cophylogeny and cospeciation among Syringophilopsis species, however, it is not concrete. Statistically, what they specifically sought after in their analysis is the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene as well as nuclear ribosomal RNA gene.  Transmission  These mites are host specific but each species has a specific niche affecting the passeriform bird in specific ways. For instance, depending on the species, these birds can transmit into the specific host via their primary, secondary, and tertiary feathers. Quill mites specifically attach to their designated host via stabbing of the calamus wall with their anatomical feature called chelicerae.

An early design was the experimental four wheel drive Formula One BRM P67 of 1964. , Pilbeam's company continued to produce hillclimb cars and sports prototype chassis for endurance racing. Biography Formula One Pilbeam spent much of his early life in West London, and had little interest in competition cars until he attended the 1958 British Grand Prix, whilst at Bristol University. In 1959, he constructed a small sportscar with which he competed himself, but without much success. However a later design and an association with club racer Tony Gould brought some success in the class. In 1963, he joined BRM as a stress engineer. He assisted in the construction and design of the P67 whilst still an apprentice and the actual design is usually credited to Tony Rudd. The car, driven by Richard Attwood, was entered for the 1964 British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch but was withdrawn after practice. It did not make any further appearances until 1968, when it appeared in hillclimb events, initially driven by Peter Westbury and subsequently by Peter Lawson and was a championship winning machine. After the abandonment of the P67 project, Pilbeam worked on the BRM H16 engine, helping to develop it to the point where Jim Clark was able to win the 1966 United States Grand Prix with a Lotus 43-BRM. Pilbeam moved to Ford at Dunton, Essex in 1966, where he worked in the advanced chassis department. He moved to Lotus in 1969, where he worked on the four-wheel-drive Lotus 63, alongside Maurice Philippe, and also on the Lotus 49B and 72 models. Pilbeam left Lotus in 1972, moving to Surtees where he worked on the Surtees TS9, but in 1973 returned to BRM. Chief designer Tony Southgate had left BRM towards the end of the season and Pilbeam accepted a job as manager of the design office. This gave him the chance to design the BRM P201 for , which was still competing as late as the 1977 Formula One season. Pilbeam Racing Designs BMW at 'Motor Sport at the Palace', Crystal Palace (circuit) 27 May 2012 Pilbeam left BRM in late 1974, after Louis Stanley took control of the company, and in 1975 established Pilbeam Racing Designs, initially working from home. His first design was a Formula Atlantic chassis for Tom Wheatcroft which was also adapted to Formula Two, where it was driven by Brian Henton. Subsequently, Pilbeam began constructing hillclimb cars. Pilbeam cars won the British Hill Climb Championship 17 times between 1977 and 1997. Pilbeam was also involved in the design of the Penske PC3, as well as engineering the RAM Racing Brabham BT44s in 1976. He also designed the LEC CRP1 F1 car for David Purley, which competed in the 1977 Formula One season. In this machine, during practice for the 1977 British Grand Prix at Silverstone, Purley was involved in one of the heaviest impacts where a driver has survived. Pilbeam has a reputation for the structural integrity of his designs and it has been considered that this was crucial to the driver's survival. Other freelance work continued, but the F2 MP42 ground effect car commissioned by Mike Earle in 1979 was not successful, although hillclimb success kept the company in good order. A Pilbeam-modified Brabham BT38-Cosworth won the British Hillclimb Championship in 1977 and in 1979, Pilbeam designed the MP40, which was a hillclimb car to European Formula Two specification. This machine won British Hillclimb titles in 1979 and from 1981 to 1984, powered by a Brian Hart engine. Pilbeam moved into his own premises, in a former part of BRM's operation at Bourne, Lincolnshire in 1981 and produced uncompetitive designs for Formula Ford 2000 and Formula Three in 1982 and 1983, although the hillclimb designs continued to be successful. In 1997 new premises at Bourne were opened by Bette Hill, (widow of Graham), and Pilbeam continued to work within the industry on both road and racing car projects on a freelance basis. Pilbeam's own designs continued to be produced in small numbers to order and when his freelance work allowed. Pilbeam Racing Designs was involved in the development of the BRM P301 sportscar in the mid-1990s before subsequently producing their own chassis to compete in the Le Mans 24 hour race and in the World Endurance Championship in the LMP2 class, between 2001 and 2007 and in 2014, produced the MP100 intended as a customer car for LMP2 and the Le Mans race itself.

Education  Ernest James Goddard was born on 20 February 1883 in Newcastle, New South Wales, one of six sons born to Alfred and Elizabeth Goddard. He attended Maitland High School and then his family moved to Sydney for he and his brother's education at the University of Sydney where he studied first a B.A. in 1904, and then took a BSc in 1906, with honours in zoology and palaeontology.  Career  Goddard was appointed a junior demonstrator in Biology whilst in the final years of his Science degree, and also upon his graduation in 1906. Professor Edgeworth David employed him as a biologist for the Royal Society Expedition of Fiji. Upon his return from Fiji in 1908 , he became a Macleay Linnean Research Fellow in Zoology at the University of Sydney . He received the first D.Sc. degree awarded by the University of Sydney in 1910. Much of the content of this dissertation was published in the Journal of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. This led to him being offered the Chair of Zoology, Geology and Mineralogy at Victoria College, (Stellenbosch University from 1918), South Africa. The Department of Geology would be later split from his role, and he would mainly oversee zoology. Goddard continued to publish especially in the areas of his PhD research on leeches and earthworms. He undertook a zoological survey of South Africa upon commencing work there, and chose a site for the South African Marine Biological and Oceanographic Station. Many of his papers considered the Antarctic; he attempted to establishing an expedition there, never obtained funding . Goddard was interested in many social questions. Following WW1, racial tensions in South Africa increased. Despite making his zoology department the largest in South Africa, and being selected to join the Quest expedition to Antarctica as an oceanographer and marine biologist in 1922, Goddard applied for the Chair of Biology at the University of Queensland and was successful, taking up the post in 1923. At Brisbane, Goddard was an active organiser and public speaker, promoting science in the public arena though lectures and newspaper publicity. He was especially interested in agricultural and economic biology, particularlyentomology. He spoke on the use of cactoblastis in prickly pear eradication and was supervisor of the Bunchy Top Investigation committee, investigating this disease in bananas, in 1924. Goddard became the first Dean of the Faculty of Agriculture in 1927. He then became involved with the establishment of a Faculty of Medicine, especially a degree in Dentistry. After many years of negotiation and with Goddard defending his department's biology courses in the Dentistry Diploma course, the Faculty of Dentistry was established in 1935 with Goddard as the first dean. From 1931, Goddard worked toward establishing a Medical School, even getting the Masonic Lodge to donate their old building for an Anatomy School. In 1935, Goddard acted as spokesman on a visit to the Queensland Premier, William Forgan Smith, and was so persuasive that it was announced in Parliament the next day that a Faculty of Medicine would be established in 1936. Other programs Goddard worked upon included the establishment of a Physiotherapy course, which came into being after the Faculty of Medicine was approved. He was particularly keen to establish a marine biology station in Queensland and attempted to persuade the University Senate to purchase Dunk Island in 1927, and continued to put forward a number of island options over the next 20 years. Glass houses and laboratories for plant pathology, entomology and an insectarium were acquired through grant money and a forestry course commenced in 1924. . Goddard helped form the Entomological Society of Queensland in 1923. He was President of the Royal Society of Queensland in 1927, the Queensland Naturalists' Club, and the Australian-American Association. He was Chairman of the Queensland branch of the Australian Institute of Agricultural Science. From 1936‚Äì1939 he was seconded to the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock as science coordinating officer. In a paper to the zoology section of the A.N.Z.A.A.S, Goddard appealed for \\"an end to anthropocentrism in the study of Man. Instead he called for the \\"discovery, elucidation and dissemination of principles that will enable us to envisage with scientific precision the interdependence and inter-reaction of the animal organism or individual and its environment\\". While setting up the marine biology research station at Heron Island which he had toiled to establish and where he planned to retire to continue research, Goddard died of a heart attack on the island on 17 January 1948. He was survived by his wife.  Legacy  The Goddard Biological Sciences building fronting the Great Court of the University of Queensland was named for him. After his death, the Goddard Memorial Fund was set up, the money from which helped to establish the Heron Island Research Station, then run by the Great Barrier Reef Committee. The University of Queensland would take over its operation in 1970, first as a partner and then as owner in 1980. The Ernest James Goddard Oration was established by the Queensland Branch of the Australian Dental Association to commemorate his work as a pioneer of dental education in Queensland. The most recent was the 20th oration in 2008.

In October 2018 he was elected a congressman for the 20192022 term, being the fourth most voted.  Political career  According to Kataguiri, his involvement in politics began in August 2013 when he was 17-years-old. In a history class at his college in S√£o Paulo state, his teacher asserted that Brazil's \\"popular cash transfer program applauded by many experts around the globe was responsible for the expansion of Brazil's middle class and for lifting millions of citizens from poverty during the last decade.\\" Kataguiri was not convinced: \\"That just seemed wrong. The family allowance might be necessary, but it has flaws and the main reasons for our high economic growth was the commodities boom and our relationship with China.\\" He was also struck by how his peers readily accepted Brazil's model of state capitalism as practiced by the ruling Workers' Party. Rather than respond to his teacher in class, Kataguiri posted a video to YouTube, which quickly went viral. Kataguiri said: \\"This was when I realized I could use the internet to defend free market values.\\" He posted to YouTube more satirical videos, which gained millions of views as Brazil fell into recession and political crisis. Kataguiri then founded the Free Brazil Movement, \\"a libertarian group that espouses free- market values\\".

Balanced action trumpets Balanced action trumpets have the valve assembly set forward (170mm vs. 140mm), closer to the bell. This style of trumpet was first developed by the Henri Selmer Paris company in 1933 for Louis Armstrong, and was also famously used by Harry James,http://orgs.usd.edu/nmm/HarryJamestrumpet.html who preferred the configuration because of his long arms. Similar trumpets were also made by F. E. Olds (the Olds Recording Model) beginning in 1950http://rouses.net/trumpet/oldserno.htm and King Musical Instruments, with the last instruments of this type being manufactured in the early 1970s. Balanced action saxophones The Selmer Balanced Action saxophone was manufactured by Selmer from 1935 through 1947. It introduced a revolutionary new layout for the key table operating the G and low C, B, and B keys. The layout solved long-standing deficiencies in those mechanisms and all modern saxophones have left hand key tables derived from this arrangement.http://www.saxpics.com/?v=mod&modID;=11http://www.selmer.fr/histdetail.php?id=45 The problems to solve The left hand key table had been an awkward feature of the saxophone from its earliest days. Drawbacks and compromises were inherent in the old layout with the long hinges running down the lower left side of the instrument. The bell keys were the heaviest keys with the heaviest action on the saxophone and the weakest of all the fingers were tasked with operating them. The pivots on the left side put the arcs of the key action in a direction that forced some degree of pushing left-to-right across the saxophone to operate the keys, in a weak direction of the finger away from the palm. Long arms to the lowermost key cups caused a tendency for them to bounce slightly upon closing. The long hinge tubes were also in a position vulnerable to damage from impacts on the left side of the instrument, especially the C hinge that extended to a high post on or near the bow. Minimizing the amount of left-to-right push was an objective that favored short lever action in the cluster, at the cost of leverage to gain positive action in operating the keys. The problem could also be mitigated by angling the key touches downward towards the body off the radius of the arc, but that was only a partial solution. With the adoption of articulated G key action operated by the bell key mechanisms, more leverage from the table keys became necessary. Enlarged key tables considerably increased the leverage of the B and B keys although the left-to-right push was more severe owing to the larger arc radius of the larger keys. Some increase in leverage was possible with the C key, although its position in the table limited its design options. Conn's pretty good solutions With the C.G. Conn 6M and 10M saxophones, the low C, B, and B key touches were mounted angled strongly off the radius of the action. The G key touch was mounted on a horizontal pivot and on the same plane as the bell key touches. That layout mitigated the cross-push issue considerably and compared favorably to those of competitors King, Buescher, Martin, and, at its introduction, Selmer. With the 26M and 30M \\"Connqueror\\" saxophones, Conn mounted all of the left cluster touches on horizontal pivots and moved the cluster closer to the left hand stack keys. That was a good ergonomic solution with action in the strong direction of the finger, but the mechanism was complex, costly to produce, and required extra adjustment. The C pivot was also shortened and connected to the cup with an angled arm on the Connqueror models, mitigating some of its vulnerability. After these instruments were introduced, Conn's development efforts stagnated and the Connqueror models were discontinued in 1943. Selmer's better solution The right hand bell key layout introduced by Conn (for baritones) and King in the early 1930s provided the basis for Selmer's ultimate solution, shifting the bell 14 degrees to the left and mounting the table keys on pivots located over the right hand stack keys. With the arc of the action reversed, the table keys were pushed downwards towards the body tube in the strong direction of the finger. The lever arm of the C key touch was lengthened, with considerable benefit. The bell key arms were shortened in that arrangement, adding mechanical advantage for positive key action and mitigating the tendency to bounce that had plagued the old style bell keys mounted on longer arms. The more compact mechanism reduced the mass of the bell keys, lightening the action. The reversed pivot direction also provided an opportunity to design a linkage for the C key touch to gain mechanical advantage in overcoming the spring holding the cup in its closed position, allowing greater spring strength for a more robust seal of the pad. With those changes in action, the bell keys finally became balanced with the action of the rest of the horn, hence the name. The new layout also resulted in better protected mechanisms and more robust bell braces. The long, vulnerable hinges on the lower left side of the horn were replaced with shorter hinges in a less vulnerable position. The bell brace could be moved to the left side, with more options available for designing it for optimal protection and that is what Selmer did. Subsequent developments The Balanced Action was initially offered with two options for bell design, a short bell and a long bell. The short bell was freer blowing but resulted in intonation problems in the lower register. A high F key was offered as another option. That option was not widely adopted because of its reputation for causing poor intonation with the Balanced Action and its Super Action and Mark VI descendants, although it later became a feature on most professional class saxophones. The Balanced Action gained prestige through its use by the jazz saxophonist Coleman Hawkins, who made a splash with his return from France to the US and recording of Body and Soul in 1939. With Selmer's next model, the Super Action introduced in 1948 with offset right and left hand key stacks, the basic layout of the modern saxophone was established. The Super Action also featured a removable bell and adjustment screws for keywork, which have become standard on modern saxophones. Further ergonomic improvements were offered with the Mark VI introduced in 1953, which became the most widely used professional class saxophone produced in the mid twentieth century. King was the first manufacturer other than Selmer to adopt table key mechanisms derived from those of the Balanced Action, in 1949. By the late 1960s, the new style mechanisms were on virtually every new model saxophone being introduced. The legacy mechanisms were continued on some student models into the 1980s. Improvements to the original mechanism added by Selmer and others include enlarged and contoured key touches, tilting key touches and rollers, and reinforcing braces for the top pillar supporting the mechanism.

She is known for her contributions to Czech New Wave cinema in the 1960s, including collaborations with directors Vƒõra Chytilov√° and Jan Nƒõmec. In 2017, a private archive of Krumbachov√°'s artwork, photography, documents, and clothes was made accessible by curators Edith Je≈ô√°bkov√° and Zuzana Blochov√°. Krumbachov√° has since been the subject of retrospective exhibitions at TRANZITDISPLAY, Prague (2017) and the CCA: Centre for Contemporary Arts, Glasgow (2018). Early life Ester Krumbachov√° was born in Brno, Czechoslovakia in 1923. She went to college and worked on local theater productions in ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice before moving to Prague in the early 1960s. She began to work in the film industry in 1961. Career She worked as a costume designer on the film Diamonds of the Night (1964) with then-husband and director Jan Nƒõmec; this was her first collaboration with Nƒõmec. Her first addition to a script was on Zbynƒõk Brynych's Holocaust film The Fifth Horseman is Fear (1965). However, this credit is masked by her only being listed the film's costume designer. Her major script contribution was on the screenplay for Nƒõmec's A Report on the Party and the Guests (1966). The film is based on a novella by Krumbachov√°. Eventually, she would be banned from film making because of her involvement with A Report on the Party and the Guests. In 1966, she worked on Daisies as a costume designer and writer; this was her first screenplay with Vƒõra Chytilov√°, a long time collaborator. She would work on two more films with Chytilov√°, Fruit of Paradise (1970) and Faunovo velmi pozdn√≠ odpoledne (1983). Krumbachov√°'s next collaboration with Nƒõmec was on the film Martyrs of Love (1967) which was described as being \\"less political in nature\\" than A Report on the Party and the Guests and more \\"arbitrary and obscure in its details.\\" In 1968, after the Prague Spring she worked on Fruit of Paradise, an avant garde adaptation of the Adam and Eve story, with Chytilov√°. in 1969, Krumbachov√° began to write The Murder of Mr.Devil with Nƒõmec; this would be the only film she would direct. Veteran Czech filmmaker Otakar V√°vra consulted Krumbachov√° on his 1970 film Witchhammer. She adapted Valerie and Her Week of Wonders from the novel of the same name with Czech director Jaromil Jire≈° in the same year. In 1983 she worked on two films, Faunovo velmi pozdn√≠ odpoledne which was her last colabortation with Chytilov√°, and Strata, a New Zealand film. Krumbachov√° published a book Prvn√≠ kn√≠≈æka Ester (The First Book of Ester) in 1994. Legacy Much of Krumbachov√°'s work has been overlooked, despite her influence on the Czech New Wave. In Jan Nƒõmec's film Late Talks with My Mother (2001), she appears as one of the people Nƒõmec talks to. In 2005, Vƒõra Chytilov√° directed the documentary In Search of Ester about Krumbachov√°'s life and involvement in the Czech New Wave. Krumbachov√° was the subject of the retrospective exhibition A Weakness for Raisins: Films and Archives of Ester Krumbachov√† at the CCA: Centre for Contemporary Arts in Glasgow. The exhibition presented elements of Krumbachov√†'s personal archives to explore themes of \\"agency, magic, materialism, gender, feminism, the interconnected nature of reality, and sensory forms of knowledge.\\" The exhibition also featured contemporary artists whose work has been influenced by Krumbachov√°, including ACID PRAWN (Sian Dorrer), Marek Meduna, Sally Hackett and France-Lise McGurn. Personal life and death She was briefly married to architect Slav√≠ƒçek P√≠sa≈ô√≠k ) before marrying Czech director Jan Nƒõmec in 1963; they divorced in 1968. Nƒõmec described her as his \\"muse\\".

Nestor was primarily operated as a towboat, and did most of the towing work on the Cowlitz River. During the 1920s Nestor was part of a small fleet of towboats operated out of Rainier, Oregon by Capt. Milton Smith. Construction Nestor was built at Catlin, Washington, (now west Kelso) in 1902 by Capt. C.P. Stayton (1846-1932), and named after his son, Nestor W. Stayton (1878-1957), who himself later became a steamboat captain and Columbia river pilot. Initial ownership C.P. Stayton had been a Methodist minister, who originally arrived in the Pacific Northwest in 1873, where he served as a missionary in Yakima, Washington until 1889, when he came to Catlin, which is now west Kelso, Washington. At Kelso, Stayton built the first Methodist church, and then entered the steamboat business, building Nestor and holding an ownership interest in the Kelso-Catlin ferry, which crossed the Cowlitz river before it was bridged. Dimensions Nestor was 82.4 feet long exclusive of the extension over the stern, called the ‚Äúfantail‚Äù on which the stern-wheel was mounted. Nestor had a beam (width) of 19.6 feet, exclusive of the guards, which were long heavy protective timbers running along the outside of the top of the hull on both sides. Depth of hold was 5.0 feet. The overall size of the vessel was 133 gross and 78 registered tons. The twin-horizontally mounted single-cylinder steam engines generated 150 indicated horsepower. The number of crew required was listed as five. The official merchant vessel registry number was 130998. Nestor was originally owned by the Columbia & Cowlitz River Transportation Company. For many years it was worked as a towboat on the Cowlitz River. Later, under Captain Milton Smith, Nestor engaged in towing work on the Columbia River. In late 1903 Nestor was rebuilt at Rainier, Oregon, reducing the vessels overall size from 133 to 97 gross tons. The purpose was to lower the required number of crew, with craft of less than 100 tons having to carry much fewer crew than craft over 100 tons. The reduction consisted of reducing the size of the cabin structure, called the ‚Äúhouse‚Äù and leaving the lower, or ‚Äúfreight‚Äù deck, open on the sides. Operations Service (center), Cowlitz (center), and Nestor (right), tied up at a dock, probably at Rainier, Oregon, some time between 1917 and 1929. Nestor handled most of the towing business on the Cowlitz river from 1902 to the 1920s. The company added the shallow-draft sternwheeler Cowlitz in 1917. Milton Smith moved the company‚Äôs headquarters from Kelso to Rainier, Oregon. Offer for sale to port commission In November 1913 Nestor was offered for sale to the Port of Portland commission for the price of $9,000.00. However the port decided to buy the sternwheeler Pronto for the same price, Pronto having served under lease as a dredge tender for several months. Crewman drowned dogging logs On February 28, 1914, Jack Pferdner, captain of the steamer Agnes, was serving on Nestor while Agnes was temporarily out of service. Nestor was towing logs. Near Prescott about 3 miles upriver from Rainier, some logs broke loose. Pferdner walked out on the log tow to secure the loose logs. This was called ‚Äúdogging‚Äù. The log Pferdner was walking on rolled, and he was thrown head-first into the river. Pferdner came up and tried to grab on to the log, but it kept rolling, and he could not get a grip. Capt James Peck, in charge of Nestor, yelled at Pferdner to get to the end of the log, but by this time, Pferdner was too exhausted to comply. He let go of the log and sank under the water, and was not seen again. Grappling hooks were used to search, all afternoon, for Pferdner‚Äôs body, but the only thing that was found was the hatchet that Pferdner had been holding when he was thrown into the water. Loss of chief engineer On October 4, 1915, Nestor‚Äôs chief engineer, Sebastian Hartman, then 55 years old, dropped dead in the U.S. Customs House in Portland. Hartman had just exited the elevator on the second floor, on his way to visit a steamboat inspector. Fatal electric wire accident On Tuesday, January 8, 1918, Nestor was towing a pile driver on the Cowlitz River when a serious accident occurred. Nestor was on the way upstream, with the driver to be used to replace dolphins and pilings at lumber camps. As the steamer and tow passed under a power line north of the Cowlitz County bridge, the pile driver, 75 feet high, snagged on a live electric wire strung across the channel at a point about 15 down from the top of the driver. One man was killed and two others were severely burned. Two days later, A.E. Hayes filed a formal complaint with Colonel Zinn, of the Corps of Engineers, requesting that the height of the wires be investigated. Hayes also alleged that he had been told by a representative of the North Coast Power Company that the current was to have been cut off when the tow passed. Ownership shift In early March 1919, Captain Milton Smith, of Rainier, Oregon, took over the Collins and Ostrander shares of the Columbia & Cowlitz River Transportation Company. Near destruction by fire Service in background alongside. On November 7, 1920, Nestor, while moored at Rainier, Nestor caught fire and was nearly destroyed. Nestor had been tied up to the dock owned by Capt. Milton Smith. The fire was not discovered until 4:00 a.m., and when it was, Nestor was set adrift to keep the blaze from spreading to two other vessels at the same dock. The fire was eventually extinguished and the Nestor was beached. The hull was not damaged, and Nestor was rebuilt and placed back in service on April 10, 1921. By March 1922, the Milton Smith flotilla consisted of Nestor, Cowlitz, Service (ex-Inland Empire, built in 1908), and the Olympian (ex-Telegraph), built in 1903 and once one of the fastest steamers on Puget Sound. Abandonment Nestor was abandoned in 1929.

It is the only remaining recognized shoe polish brands to exist through three centuries. The founder of the brand was William Edward Wren. Early history (late 19th century) The company's name was initially William Wren & Co but was given as Wm. Wren & Co Ltd by 1918. In a list compiled under the name \\"NORTHAMPTON BOOT & SHOE TRADE 1928\\" by Elaine Allen, the company's name was listed as Wren, William & Co. Ltd. in three different addresses in Northamptonshire. Business was brisk from the start as Northamptonshire, even now, is home to many fine shoe and boot makers, such as Edward Green, Loake, Church's and Tricker's. WREN'S became known for its quality and prestige and was awarded the First Award from the Leather Trades Exhibition in 1892. In those days, the Leather Trades Exhibition held in the centre of Britain‚Äôs boot-making industry Northampton was a very prestigious event and was of significant importance to the trade. Building on this success, William Wren & Co Ltd soon branched into other products like Floor & Furniture Polish, Metal Polish, Saddle & Harness Paste, Puwite Shoe Whitener as well as the reputed Lavendo Furniture Polish in the early years. Golden years (1908-1964) From the beginning of the 20th century, WREN'S became almost synonymous with the Royal Family in England. During the reign of King Edward VII, a WREN'S advertisement for its Boot & Shoe Polish in 1908 appeared with the declaration ‚ÄúAs used by all branches of His Majesty‚Äôs Service‚Äù , particularly His Majesty's Own Royal Lancaster Regiment, the First and Fifth Battalion. The words \\"Made In England Since 1889\\" also became synonymous with the brand. In the same year, WREN'S won the Grand Prix (Grand Prize) at the International Exhibition held in Brussels as well. WREN'S reputation reached its peak when King George VI emulated his grandfather by awarding the Royal Warrant to WREN'S despite the acquisition by Chiswick Polish Co., Ltd in 1938. All shoe and boot polish would have \\"By appointment to H. M. King George VI\\" on the lids. The product became known as WREN'S Super Wax Shoe Polish. WREN'S Shoe Polish was very likely used by the British Army during World War II but this was never confirmed. King George VI died in 1952 due to ill health and was succeeded by Queen Elizabeth II, the current monarch. There was a version of the shoe polish with the Royal Warrant \\"By appointment to the late H. M. King George VI\\", very likely as a gesture of mourning for a great King. Declining years (1965-2010s) The Royal Warrant continued until around 1964, when WREN'S merged with Meltonian to form Meltonian Wren Limited. The company name appeared on the lid of the transparent shoe polish \\"By appointment to H. M. The Queen, Mfrs. of shoe polish Meltonian Wren Ltd\\". The discontinuation of the Royal Warrant was most likely due to the uncertainties caused by the successive acquisitions taking place in such a short period. After further acquisition by Reckitt & Colman Ltd, the brand went on a downward spiral until the 21st century. Revival WREN'S has been active on social media since 2014 with Facebook and Instagram being favored over other social media platforms. In 2016, WREN'S was relaunched in a few countries namely Singapore, Taiwan, New Zealand, Poland, the United Kingdom, Australia, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Canada and Indonesia. WREN'S has since enjoyed relative success and popularity on Amazon Europe consisting of Amazon UK, Amazon Italy, Amazon France, Amazon Spain and Amazon Germany. 2019 marks her 130th anniversary.

It lies at 27¬∞30'N and 41¬∞30'E close to the town of Ha'il and has a total area of around . Jabal Aja has been designated an Important Plant Area and an Important Bird and Biodiversity Area. Geography Jabal Aja is a granite mountain range about long and wide with an area of about . The mountains are criss-crossed by straight valleys that have developed along fault lines and have an altitude varying between . The mountain probably receives more rainfall than the surrounding area where Ha'il averages about . This falls mainly in winter, mostly from storms approaching from the southwest, and frost is not unusual. Jabal Aja is situated to the west and southwest of the town of Ha'il and the protected area has been extended to the northeast to include an area of arid flattish terrain with low sandstone hills and granite outcrops extending to the edge of the An Nafud desert. Flora and fauna Jabal Aja has been designated an Important Plant Area because of the richness of its plant life and the presence of many endemic and relict plant species. The reserve offers a refuge to plants from the Mediterranean and Irano-Turanian Regions in an area that otherwise forms part of the Saharo-Arabian Region. About 355 species of plant have been recorded in the reserve, including the plants found in the adjoining desert area of An Nafud. The plains have deep sandy-loam soils and the dominant plant is Haloxylon salicornicum, with the desert gourd being common and Asphodelus tenuifolius occurring in depressions. The annual plants Stipa tortilis, Picris cyanocarpa and Anthemis appear after rains. On the thin slopes below the rocks, Acacia gerrardii is dominant and is accompanied by other woody shrubs such as Searsia, Periploca, Gymnocarpos and Ephedra foliata. In the wadis and runnels, more Acacia gerrardi grows, associated with Lycium shawii, Pulicaria undulata, Ochradenus baccatus and Zilla spinosa. The combined area of Jabal Aja and Northern Ha'il has been designated an Important Bird and Biodiversity Area because of its importance as a centre for migratory birds especially the demoiselle crane (Grus virgo). Among the important species resident in the reserve are the sand partridge, griffon vulture, Egyptian vulture, desert owl and pale rockfinch. Among the migratory species that visit the reserve in passage or over-winter here are Menetries's warbler, white-throated robin, Finsch's wheatear, cinereous bunting and several species of cranes. Mammals found in the park include the grey wolf, sand cat and Nubian ibex, and there are a number of species of reptile and amphibian.

Lewis, David Friedman and Doris Wishman alive and well\\" and that appreciated these aspects of Death-Scourt Service. HorrorNews.net wrote a mostly favorable review for the movie, stating \\"At the end of the day, there's absolutely nothing about Death-Scort Service that's subtle; it hits you repeatedly about the head and neck until the final credits roll. Sometimes it's with nudity, sometimes it's with violence. Occasionally, you get both. Again, that's definitely not a complaint. I found myself enjoying the flick even when I felt dirty, which, I guess, is a compliment. Donohue and company know their audience is filled with filthy freaks, and they're more than happy to supply our demand.\\" References External links * 2015 horror films American horror films 2015 independent films American independent films American films Crowdfunded films ","title":"Death-Scort Service"},{"id":"48654727","text":"Cease Fire is a 1985 American drama film directed by David Nutter and starring Don Johnson and Lisa Blount written by George Edward Fernandez.
